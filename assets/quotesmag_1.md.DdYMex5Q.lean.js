It is a spiritual successor to Fighting Layer and the Street Fighter EX series and features many of the same characters from the latter. The game was released for PlayStation 4 in June 2018, with ports for Microsoft Windows and Arcade released the following November. A mobile version of the game, titled Fighting EX Layer -α, was later released for iOS and Android devices in April 2019. ==Gameplay== Fighting EX Layer is a fighting video game played in a 2.5D environment. Battles take place in closed arenas, which vary in size and width. The gameplay retains many of the mechanics from Arika's previous fighting games, such as Super Cancels and juggling, while adding a new running mechanic. Additionally, the game features ground chain combos, an auto-combo system, and an optional Progressive mode which simplifies command inputs. Fighting EX Layer also introduces Gougi Boost, which grants players additional bonuses and enhancements during a match. These boosts can be customized by selecting different Gougi decks before the match begins. ==Characters== Fighting EX Layer was released with 13 playable characters, all of whom made appearances in the Street Fighter EX series of games. Four additional characters were added via free post-launch updates, along with a guest fighter from SNK's Fatal Fury series as paid downloadable content. Added via free in- game update Guest character, paid downloadable content ==Development== Fighting EX Layer was developed by Japanese video game development studio Arika. The studio previously developed the Street Fighter EX series and the arcade game Fighting Layer which are spiritual predecessors to Fighting EX Layer. Following the release of Street Fighter EX3 (2000), the game's publisher Capcom halted the series. Over the years, Arika pitched multiple ideas to Capcom for a new entry in EX series, including a demo they created for a Nintendo 3DS game. However, none of the pitches were successful. Staff at Arika had been working on a 3D fighting game prototype to familiarise themselves with Unreal Engine 4. They decided to record some footage of the then-untitled prototype and release a trailer on April Fools' Day in 2017. The positive reaction from fans led Arika to turn the project into a full-fledged game, which they officially confirmed at Evo 2017. Arika self-funded the development of the game. Arika's president Akira Nishitani remarked that the company had just enough funds to see the project through to completion without external help. While he viewed the game as passion project for the studio, he said that his primary goal was to keep the company healthy financially. Nishitani noted that he was searching for potential partnerships with publishers and investors to secure additional funding, which would allow the development team to expand the game's scope and character roster. The game's official title was announced in November 2017. A public beta featuring six playable characters was made available to download on the PlayStation 4 on 11 December 2017 and ran for two weeks. The developers used the beta to test online connectivity and gather player feedback. The game was released for PlayStation 4 on 28 June 2018. The game was available in two versions: A lower-priced \\"light\\" version of the game included twelve playable characters and five Gougi decks. The standard edition of the game included all of the content from the light version, along with the playable character Hokuto and ten additional Gougi decks. The light version was later phased out in February 2019 and the standard edition became the primary release.https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2019/feb/23/fighting-ex-layers-light- version-no-longer-sale-while-standard-receives-discount-update- version-114-patch-notes-are-live/ Arika also stated their intentions to add four more characters from Street Fighter EX as downloadable content if their first-month sales targets were met. On 11 July 2018, Arika announced that a single-player Arcade Mode would be added to the game in a future update, along with additional Street Fighter EX characters Pullum Purna and Vulcano Rosso being added to the game for free. The Arcade Mode update was released two weeks later on 27 July. At Evo 2018, Arika announced Pullum and Rosso would be added in an update on 5 September, along with a further revision to the game's Arcade Mode, and that they would be developing a version of the game for arcades in collaboration with Taito. Arika also teased three more forthcoming characters: returning Street Fighter EX characters Sharon and Area, and guest fighter Terry Bogard from SNK's Fatal Fury series. Sharon and Terry were added to the game in March 2019, while Area was added the following July. On 27 September, Arika announced a port of the game for release on Microsoft Windows via Steam. Both the Arcade and Windows versions were released on 29 November, 2018. A limited version of the game for mobile phones, Fighting EX Layer -α, was released on April Fool's Day 2019. Since the game's launch, characters from the Fighting EX Layer have made crossover appearances in other titles: a female version of Skullomania is playable via downloadable content in SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy,https://www.gameinformer.com/dlc/2018/09/27/skullomania-joins-snk- heroines-as-skullolady while costumes based on Fighting EX Layer characters have appeared as limited-time additions to Street Fighter V.https://www.siliconera.com/dress-street-fighter-vs-ryu-like-fighting-ex- layers-kairi/ ==Reception== Heidi Kemps of GameSpot gave the game an 8/10 rating, praising the fighting mechanics and implementation of the Gougi system while criticizing the game's spotty netcode. Chris Carter of Destructoid gave the game a 7/10, praising its colorful character design and naturally flowing combat but criticizing the small number of game modes and the roster's lack of diversity in terms of gameplay style. He was divided on the Gougi system which he found an intriguing idea but was worried about the fact that some Gougi decks were only available through DLC. Carter also felt Fighting EX Layer made few concessions for beginners and was aimed primarily at seasoned fighting game fans. The game was nominated for \\"Game, Original Fighting\\" at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards. ==References * Category:2018 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Arika games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Versus fighting games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games with 2.5D graphics Category:Windows games ","title":"Fighting EX Layer"},{"id":"56034630","text":"Artur Bäumle (4 September 1906 - 6 January 1943) was a German athlete.

Since 2014, Therrien has been the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum's Head Curator of Architecture and Digital Initiatives. Before joining the Guggenheim, Therrien worked and taught in various capacities at the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP), and founded Therrien-Barley with fellow faculty member Chris Barley. ==Career from 2005== Therrien worked at various architecture firms in the United States and Europe between 2005 and 2008, including O.A.L., IJP Architects, and SYSTEM Architects. In 2011, he co-founded Therrien-Barley with Chris Barley, and became Chief Architect, Cloud Communications at the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. In 2013 and 2014, respectively, he served as a member of the Architizer Editorial Board and editor of the Applied Research Practices in Architecture Journal. Throughout this period, Therrien continued curating shows in Rotterdam, Montreal, and Athens, as well as in New York at MoMA PS1. Therrien has been invited to speak at prominent events across the world, appearing at the Moscow Strelka Institute, Bucharest's We Are Museums conference, Berlin's Art & Digital Culture Conference, and New York's Armory Art Fair, among others. At Columbia University, Therrien has taught courses on Silicon Valley, blockchain, post-rationality, conspiracy theories, deep history, and magic. He was a founding board member of the architecture school's alumni association, and is currently a student mentor. Therrien also spearheaded Experiments in Motion, a partnership between Columbia GSAPP and Audi of America. The program centered around developing and testing \\"new paradigms in the relationship between mobility and design.\\" ==Guggenheim== Therrien was appointed as the first curator of architecture and digital initiatives in 2014. His mixed background in academia, architecture, and computer science was cited by museum director Richard Armstrong as a major draw in the appointment. In 2015, Therrien's major projects included \\"Guggenheim Helsinki Now,\\", the Guggenheim-led design competition for the Guggenheim's new Helsinki location. Almost two thousand entires were submitted to Stage One of the competition, which were winnowed down by a team of eleven jurors. Concerns over cost and financial risk eventually led the Helsinki city council to reject the plan. Also in 2015, Therrien curated the Guggenheim's first online exhibition, \\"Åzone Futures Market,\\" in partnership with Are.na. The site allowed visitors to the site to invest cåin, a digital currency, towards different technology-driven visions of the future. Therrien began work in this period with architect Rem Koolhaas and his firm OMA on the exhibition \\"Countryside: Future of the World.\\" The exhibition was announced November 29, 2017, and will take place in the spiral rotunda of the Guggenheim's New York location in fall 2019.

As such, contrary to industrial fashion practices, slow fashion involves local artisans and the use of eco-friendly materials, with the goal of preserving crafts and the environment and, ultimately, provide value to both consumers and producers. ==Principles==  Definition  Slow fashion is a way to \\"identify sustainable fashion solutions, based on the repositioning of strategies of design, production, consumption, use, and reuse, which are emerging alongside the global fashion system, and are posing a potential challenge to it.\\" It is an alternative to fast fashion in the sense that it promotes a more ethical and sustainable way of living and consuming. \\"It encompasses the whole range of 'sustainable,' 'eco,' 'green,' and 'ethical' fashion movement\\". This movement is another business model that focuses on both slowing down consumerism and respecting the environment and ethics. Some elements of the slow fashion philosophy include: buying vintage clothes, redesigning old clothes, shopping from smaller producers, making clothes and accessories at home and buying garments that last longer. New ideas and product innovations are constantly redefining slow fashion, so using a static, single definition would ignore the evolving nature of the concept.  Fast and slow fashion  For a long time, it was defined as an opposition to fast fashion. Unlike fast fashion, slow fashion production ensures quality manufacturing to lengthen the life of the garment. Developing a garment with a cultural and emotional connection is also pertinent to the purpose behind slow fashion: consumers will keep an article of clothing longer than one season if they feel emotionally or culturally connected to the article of clothing. A taxation is in early stages of development in order to deter fashion companies from purchasing or producing materials that are not made with recycled, organic, or re-purposed materials. Utilizing materials already made will reduce the industry's carbon footprint. There is also an important movement towards companies being more transparent. Many sustainable fashion companies reveal the process in which their clothes and designs are made, aiding buyers to make more conscious purchasing decisions . In accordance with the slow movement there is a trend towards more conscious buying as well as companies attracting new consumers with their eco-friendly processes.  Authors  The idea of slow fashion became rampant after Elizabeth L. Cline published Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Clothing and rose awareness regarding the detriments of the fast fashion industry. The term was used on blogs and the internet. However, the term \\"slow clothes movement\\" was apparently coined by Angela Murrills, a fashion writer for Georgia Straight, a Vancouver-based online news magazine. However, the expression \\"slow fashion\\" was coined in a 2007 article by Kate Fletcher published in The Ecologist, where she compared the eco/sustainable/ethical fashion industry to the slow food movement: Slow Food Movement advocates the following principles: * Good: quality, flavorsome and healthy food * Clean: production that does not harm the environment * Fair: accessible prices for consumers and fair conditions and pay for producers The slow fashion movement has been studied by Kate Fletcher, a researcher, author, consultant, and design activist, and the author of Sustainable Fashion and Textiles. Her writings integrated design thinking with fashion and textiles as a necessary way to move towards a more sustainable fashion industry. Based on the three principles of slow design that were created in 2006 in Milan, Hazel Clark, in SLOW + FASHION—an Oxymoron—or a Promise for the Future…? decided to define the principles of the Slow Fashion Movement: * taking a local approach * having a transparent production system * making sustainable and sensorial products In 2019, Debapratim Purkayastha provided an example of how an operative in the slow fashion industry looks like with a case study of 7Weaves Social. The Assam- based social venture deals in sustainably sourced and manufactured Eri silk products by on one hand working with the forest-dependent indigenous people in the region, while on the other hand working with global slow fashion brands in the West. Eri silk is manufactured without killing the silk worm and only natural dyes were used by 7Weaves in coloring the fabric. The model provided sustainable livelihood to the artisan who had traditional knowledge in handloom and sericulture. 7Weaves provided guaranteed work for artisans at a fixed monthly emolument for the whole year, and redistributed 50 percent of its annual profits to the artisans and other players in the supply chain. 7Weaves's focus was also to preserve the biodiversity of the biologically rich but ecologically fragile Assam valley region. Slow fashion brands from countries including Germany, France, Belgium and Australia source garments and fabrics from 7Weaves. According, to the author, 7Weaves's focus on sustainably sourced fair trade fabrics that were long-lasting and locally produced, use of traditional values and know how, preservation of ecosystem, source diversity, and responsible business practices emphasize its slow fashion credentials.  Context  In 2009, Vogue Magazine traced the history of the context of the Slow Fashion Movement. In recent years, many companies have kick-started revolutions against fast fashion, such as Fashion Revolution Day and Second Hand September campaigns. This has led to big fast fashion retailers such as Zara and H&M; to either pledge or launch a clothing line dedicated to sustainable clothing. == Marketing == Slow fashion has its own marketing strategies as it targets a certain type of consumers. Unlike fast fashion consumers, slow fashion consumers expect classic and timeless pieces of clothes, giving importance to versatility, low maintenance and a higher quality. Marketing strategies concerning slow fashion often revolve around a more conscious consumption, focusing the advertising on environmentally and socially sustainable aspects on the clothes. Companies use several strategies in order to be less wasteful than other fast fashion brands * changing their clothing lines less often * producing and stocking less items * paying attention to the material that they use * ensuring ethical and non-exploitive methods of production Slow fashion is also often associated with thrift shops, to the extent that shrift shops offer clothes that are not produced within a just-in-time flow. == Global economy == Global economy has a market-driven aspect. This means that consumers are encourage to always buy more and producers are encourage to always produce more. Those two aspects mutually develop each other. The current economic model is said to be global because the production process is divided worldwide to maximize efficiency and profit. Slow fashion is more slow, local and quality-oriented. Therefore, it does not fit well in the global economy model. Several papers question the longevity of slow fashion in a market-driven society.  Production  In slow fashion, each designer is encouraged to produce locally, meaning using local workforce and resources. Quality is chosen over quantity which means that slow fashion refuses to exploit resources or workers. The production chains is as transparent as possible. This redefines the hierarchy between designers, consumers and producers. Fashion is known to be ruled by trends who come and go quickly, which encourages consumption. The end products offered to the clients are made to last longer and be timeless. Slow fashion has a different cost of production and cannot produce as much in quantity. Slow fashion cannot compete with the mass produced products of fast fashion that uses cheap labor and resources to maximize profits. Slow fashion is very local and used fair- trade materials and fabrics on high quality. Moreover, slow fashion is not able to produced as much fast fashion due to the very different production process. This is why so many academic papers have looked into the viability of this movement in an era of mass-production and mass-consumption. By keeping the production in \\"productive communities\\", this process is more transparent, there is less intermediation and a greater cultural and material value to the consumer. This is one of the way presented by Clarke to address the question of how can slow fashion fit in the current economic model. Recently, there has also been the implementation of carbon footprint tax on fashion supply chains to encourage the use of local supply. The effect of that measures have been limited.  Pricing  The pricing of slow fashion clothes varies a lot. Since the definition is so broad, a second-hand dress from a thrift shop worth five dollars and a designer dress costing 700 dollars can both be considered part of the slow fashion. The current economic system focuses on economic growth and quantity sold. However, research has shown that more parameters should be included due to a raising social conscience. People have said to be willing to pay more for clothes when they know that they have been produced in \\"sweat-free\\" manufacture. == Impact == The slow fashion movement, part of the greater goal of sustainable fashion and thus, a cleaner world is gaining strength, driven by growing environmental concerns. In 2018, a third of fashion consumers bought clothing once a month, a decrease from 37% compared to 2016, whereas those buying clothes every two or three months or less rose from 64% to 67%, according to the market research firm Mintel. After the release of the documentary ‘The True Cost’ and ‘River Blue’, there was attention drawn to companies that have fast fashion practices. Despite the spread movement, H&M; had revenues amount to $25 billion in the fiscal year of 2016. However, as the movement has grown in popularity, H&M;'s stock and brand image has taken a hit as consumer awareness has spread of their environmentally unethical practices leading to a drop in sales. The spread of the movement has resulted in two fast fashion giants, Zara and H&M;, switching narratives to become advocates for ethical fashion practices. With collections aimed at sustainable fashions, the two companies have shifted towards more ethical practices. Due to the audience that the movement against unethical fashion practices has accumulated, organizations such as the United States Fashion Industry Association have devoted some of their attention to ‘social compliance and sustainability’. == Critics == Critics have called out against certain brands who have claimed to strive to follow slow fashion's principles. For example, Swedish brand H&M; was accused of not being sustainable when reports found out that it burns its unsold clothes. ==See also== *Ecodesign *Empathic design *Sustainable clothing *Trashion ==References== Fashion Category:2007 introductions Category:Fashion aesthetics Category:Sustainable development ","title":"Slow fashion"},{"id":"56034923","text":"Edward Boyce (born 2 June 1913, date of death unknown) was a British athlete.

Paulson began working as a mathematician at JPL in 1948, where she calculated rocket trajectories by hand. She is among the women who made early progress at JPL. == Early life == Paulson was born in Columbus, Ohio on April 11, 1928. She was raised with three siblings (two older sisters and one younger brother), and when she was 12 years old her father died. Beginning in 9th grade, Paulson took four years of Latin and math while her sisters took short hand as Paulson did not want to be a secretary. After attending Ohio State University for one year, Paulson's sister, who was already working in Pasadena at the time, convinced her mother to move to Pasadena as well. In 1947 the family moved to Pasadena, California, where her career at JPL would begin. In 1959 Barbara married Harry Murray Paulson in Pasadena where they lived until 1962 before moving to Monrovia. In 1975 they finally settled in Glendora. == Career == Paulson joined the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1948 as a computer, calculating rocket paths and working on the MGM-5 Corporal, the first guided missile designed by the United States to carry a nuclear warhead. Paulson and her colleagues were at one point invited to sign their names on the 100th Corporal rocket prior to its transport to the White Sands test range. The rocket exploded shortly after liftoff. On January 31, 1958., Paulson was assigned to the operations center for Explorer-1, the first satellite of the United States, launched during the Space Race with the Soviet Union. Paulson did the work with minimal equipment: a mechanical pencil, light table, and graph paper. The multi-stage launch that Paulson aided in calculations for allowed the Corporal could carry a warhead over 200 miles. In 1960, when Paulson was 32 years old, her husband Harry were expecting their first child. When Paulson requested a closer parking space at work because she was pregnant, she was forced to quit as JPL did not employ pregnant women at the time and keeping a pregnant women on staff would result in insurance policy problems. JPL had no maternity leave, so women who were fired or forced to quit their positions did not have jobs to return to after giving birth. Paulson's supervisor, Helen Ling, worked hard to rehire women who'd been forced out with no parental leave, so in 1961, when her daughter was seven months old, Paulson accepted Ling's offer and returned to the lab. Paulson notably did not apply for a better parking spot when she got pregnant for the second time. At one point during Paulson's early years at JPL a beauty contest was held amongst the other female human computers. Paulson came in third place and the queen of the contest was called 'Miss Guided Missile'. In the 1960s, with JPL's reputation cemented in the success of Explorer-1, JPL began to set its sights on the moon and other interplanetary exploration missions. Paulson and her colleague Helen Ling worked overtime to calculate trajectories of the Mariner probes that would later be sent to Venus and Mars. Paulson and her colleagues determined that only brief timeframes and launch opportunities existed that allowed for the ideal transit from Earth to its target. In the late 1960s Paulson was given title of engineer and eventually became a supervisor in the lab. Paulson's calculations helped ensure success of Viking 1 which sent the first images from the surface of Mars (1976) In the 1970s Paulson later went on to play a vital role in the Viking program, the first lander to reach the surface of mars. Paulson successfully calculated the trajectory the Viking probe needed on its 11-month transit between Earth and Mars. Paulson's calculations also proved to be essential during the entry, descent, and landing (EDL) phase of the mission in which the lander would detach from the spacecraft, enter the martian atmosphere, and parachute down to the surface. In the late 1970s Paulson and her colleagues worked on some of the first interstellar trajectories during the planning of the Voyager missions in which Voyager 1, having launched in September 1977, and as of April 13, 2019 is the most distant from Earth of all human-made objects. Paulson retired from JPL in 1993 and remained in Pasadena until 2003 before moving to Iowa. == Personal life == Paulson and her husband Harry had daughters Karen (née Paulson) Bishop and Kathleen (née Paulson) Knutson, four grandchildren, and several nieces and nephews. Throughout pregnancy and her eventually return to work at JPL, Barbara's husband at the time was a real estate appraiser and member of the Pasadena Board of Realtors. Fortunately, upon Barbara's return to work Harry was able to adjust his schedule, as did many of the other human computers with children, to ensure that their children were taken care of. Barbara Paulson's husband Harry Murray Paulson passed away on July 9, 2003, they were married 44 years. In 2003, Paulson sold her home following her husband's death, and moved to Iowa to be closer to her daughters and their families. == Recognition and Legacy == In 1959 Paulson was recognized and received her 10-year pin for her work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Paulson would work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for 45 years, and retire in 1993. In 2016, Nathalia Holt wrote Rise of the Rocket Girls, a book about Paulson and other women who were early employees at NASA. == References == Category:Human computers Category:1928 births Category:Living people Category:NASA people Category:American women mathematicians ","title":"Barbara Paulson"},{"id":"56035085","text":"Acanthobrama urmianus is a species of freshwater cyprinid fish, which is endemic to Iran. ==References== urmianus Category:Fish described in 1899 ","title":"Acanthobrama urmianus"},{"id":"56035105","text":"Chang Chia-gwe (; born 23 May 1915, date of death unknown) was a Chinese athlete.

The unit was based in Vaxholm in Uppland. ==History== Vaxholm Artillery Corps, the first fortress artillery corps in Sweden, originated in 1794 from a company of Svea Artillery Regiment (No 1) placed in Vaxholm, which together with the fortress company of Göta Artillery Regiment (No 2) formed Vaxholms Artillery Corps (No 5) on 1 January 1901 after a parliament decisions two years earlier. The corps was located at Vaxholm Fortress and Oskar-Fredriksborg Fortress on Rindö and consisted of 23 officers, 25 non-commissioned officer, two civilian and 400 men divided into four companies. The crew was enlisted with the addition of military men from the coast of Roslagen and Stockholm. Its commanding officer was also commandant at both fortresses, belonged to the 4th Military District and the 4th Division. The uniforms was those for artillery, with a few modifications. The color of the collar of the atilla was red. Vaxholm Artillery Corps changed designation in 1892 to No 8 and the color of the collar became white in the design for the fortress artillery (half the collar with lace). For entry into the corps and promotion to lieutenant, similar regulations applied as for the field artillery. The crew was enlisted for 2 years, but could recapitulate. The training of underbefäl (non-commissioned officers) took place in the corps, but the officers' preparatory studies for entry into the Artillery and Engineering College was taught at Svea Artillery Regiment's school in Stockholm. On 12 December 1901 the corps was dissolved and was terminated from the artillery, to form Vaxholm Coastal Artillery Regiment (KA 1) in the coastal artillery on 1 January 1902. ==Commanding officers== Commanding officers from 1888 to 1901: *1888–1896: Hugo Wennerholm *1896–1901: Oskar Sylvander ==Names, designations and locations== {  ! style=\\"font-weight:bold;\\"  Name ! style=\\"font-weight:bold;\\"  Translation ! style=\\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\\"  From ! ! style=\\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\\"  To -  style=\\"font-style:italic;\\"  Kungl.

He went to high school with fellow NAS member Adi Shamir. He graduated magna cum laude in 1975 from Tel Aviv University in biology. He received his Ph.D. in molecular biology from University of California, Los Angeles in 1979, where he studied genetic regulation of metallothioneins. He then did a postdoctoral fellowship with Beatrice Mintz at the Fox Chase Cancer Center, and a postdoc with John Baxter at the University of California, San Francisco. ==Career== In 1982, Karin was hired as Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Southern California. In 1986, he moved to the University of California, San Diego. At UCSD Karin has continued his studies of metallothionein gene regulation, mapping promoter elements that mediate gene induction by heavy metals, phorbol ester tumor promoters and glucocorticoid hormone. This work led to identification of AP-1 transcription factors, later found to be composed of Jun and Fos prototo- oncoproteins. Studying how phosphorylation of c Jun controls its transcriptional activity the Karin lab discovered the Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) subgroup of MAP kinases and moleculary cloned them in collaboration with Roger Davis. Following their charting of the JNK signaling pathway, Karin and coworkers have begun to study the role of protein phosphorylation in control of NF-κB activity. That work has led to identification and molecular cloning of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which has turned out to be one of the major activators of the inflammatory response and innate immunity. Having found that IKK dependent NF- κB activation suppresses programmed cell death, Karin and colleagues postulated that NF-κB provided the long suspected mechanistic link between inflammation and cancer. Within two years of making this proposal they obtained strong experimental evidence that NF-κB activation does provide a major mechanism through which inflammation and infection promote cancer development, especially in the gastrointestinal track. The Karin lab was also the first to show how hepatic steatosis stimulates development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the major liver cancer form. They also developed a highly efficient and robust model for studying how HCC development is promoted by the common metabolic disorder non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Using the so-called MUP-uPA mouse they demonstrated that NASH development depends on ER stress and TNF-mediated inflammation. NASH to HCC progression depends on suppression of CD8 T cell-mediated immunosurveillance, caused by accumulation of immunosuppressive IgA producing plasma cells. These pathogenic mechanisms were shown to be clinically relevant, thus providing an explanation to the surprising efficacy of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitory drugs in human non-viral HCC. ==Awards== *2005 - Elected Member of the National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC *2007 - Elected Foreign Associate of the European Molecular Biology Organization *2011 - Elected Member of the Institute of Medicine *2011 - Harvey Prize in Human Health *2013 - William B.

She showed her best form as a two-year-old in 1987 when she won three of her five races including the Railway Stakes and the Moyglare Stud Stakes and was rated the best filly of her generation in Ireland. She made no impact in two races as a three-year-old and was retired from racing at the end of the year. She was then exported to become a broodmare in Japan where she produced four winners. ==Background== Flutter Away was a bay mare bred in Ireland by the County Kildare-based Baroda Stud. In 1986 the filly was sent to the Goffs Irish National Yearlings Sales and was bought privately by Ovidstown Bloodstcok. She entered the ownership of the businessman Oliver Murphy and was sent into training with Dermot Weld. She was ridden in most of her races by Mick Kinane. She was from the third crop of foals sired by Lomond, an American-bred half-brother of Seattle Slew who won the 2000 Guineas in 1983. His other offspring included Marling, Dark Lomond, Inchmurrin, Valanour and River North. Flutter Away's dam Flying Bid showed little racing ability but did manage to win one minor race at Listowel Racecourse as a four-year-old and was a sister to the Prix Robert Papin winner Maelstrom Lake. As a descendant of the Irish broodmare Bridle Way (foaled 1952), she was also a distant relative of the Belmont Stakes winner Caveat. ==Racing career== 1987: two- year-old season Flutter Away began her racing career in a five furlong maiden race at Phoenix Park Racecourse in May and won by two and a half lengths from Saintly Lass. The form of the race was boosted at Royal Ascot in June when the runner-up finished second in the Queen Mary Stakes. In July Flutter Away was stepped up in class and distance for the Group 3 Railway Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh. She won by a short head from Fairy Gold (a full-sister) to Sadler's Wells with the pair finishing several lengths clear of their rivals. The filly was the moved to Group 1 class for the Phoenix Stakes on 9 August. Starting at odds of 8/1, she came home seventh of the twelve runners, five lengths behind the winner Digamist and four lengths behind Fairy Gold, who finished third. Later that month she produced another disappointing effort, running fourth of five behind Lake Como in the Anglesey Stakes. On 13 September Flutter Away was one of eleven fillies to contest the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh and was made the 7/1 fourth choice in the betting. Fairy Gold started favourite ahead of the British challengers Thaidah and Timely, while the best-fancied of the others was Lively Pebbles, another British-trained filly. The field was described as \\"undistinguished\\" by Timeform. Equipped with blinkers for the first time Flutter Away finished strongly to catch Fairy Gold in the final strides and won by a short head despite hanging to the right in the closing stages. Timely was only a short head away in third, just ahead of Thaidah. In the official International Classification for 1987 she was rated on 112, making her the top-rated juvenile filly in Ireland, albeit 13 pounds inferior to the French- trained Ravinella who topped the classification. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 104, seventeen pounds behind Ravinella, who was their best two-year-old filly. 1988: three-year-old season Flutter Away began her second season in the Harp Lager 1000 Guineas Trial at Phoenix Park on 2 April for which she started 4/5 favourite but finished fourth of the seven runners, beaten more than ten lengths by the winner Bell Tower. On 21 May the filly started a 25/1 outsider for the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh in which she was ridden by Greville Starkey, with Kinane taking the ride on her better fancied stablemate Trusted Partner. In what proved to be her final track appearance, Flutter Away came home tenth of the sixteen runners, as Trusted Partner took the race. ==Breeding record== At the end of her racing career, Flutter Away was exported to become a broodmare in Japan. She produced five foals and four winners: *Takano Prima, a bay filly, foaled in 1990, sired by Bamboo Atlas. Won three races. *Belvedere, brown filly, 1992, by Tosho Boy. Won three races. *Flutter Lady, bay filly, 1993, by Creator. Won one race. *Hello Good-bye, bay colt, 1994, by Crystal Glitters. Failed to win in six races. *Rusunai Angel, grey filly, 1999, by Black Tie Affair. Won one race. Although her last foal was born in 1999 she was still being covered as late as 2004. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1985 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Thoroughbred family 3-n ","title":"Flutter Away"},{"id":"56035310","text":"Endurance Abinuwa (born 31 July 1987) is a Nigerian sprinter.

Despite laws demanding school integration since 1949, a 2017 study by the UCLA Civil Rights Project and Indiana University found that Indiana still has significant segregation in its classrooms. The average black student in Indiana is likely to attend a school where 68% of the students are non-white. The average white student is likely to attend a school where 81% of the students are white. ==Background== Indiana became a state in 1816. In 1843 the Legislature stated that \\"colored students\\" could not study in the public schools (see Union Literary Institute). In 1869, the legislature authorized separate but equal public schools for black children. In 1877, the legislature revised the law to allow black attendance at a white school if a black school was not nearby. Home rule for municipalities meant that application was uneven. Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) legitimized separate but equal as policy. In 1946, the Gary School Board issued a non-discriminatory policy. Because neighborhoods had different demographic characteristics, the schools there remained effectively segregated. In 1949, the state adopted language that was unambiguously in favor of integration. It was the last of the northern (non-Confederate) states to do so. After Brown v. Board of Education, the state still needed a legal push. Bell v. School City of Gary (1963) was the first. Three years later came Copeland v. South Bend Community School Corporation (1967). Three years after that came Banks v. Muncie Community Schools (1970). National policy came the next year in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education (1971), which relied on the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the 1970s, the federal answer was court-ordered busing. In Indianapolis, busing began in 1981. Busing in Indianapolis ended in 2016. ==Demographics== Hoosiers describe themselves as being more white than much of the rest of the country. In the 2010 Census, 84.4% reported being white, compared with 73.8 for the nation as a whole. Indiana had never been a big slave state. The 1840 Census reported three slaves and 11,262 “free colored” persons out of a population of 685,866. By 1850, no slaves were reported. That is not to say that the state was welcoming to blacks. The 1851 state constitution said, \\"No Negro or mulatto shall come into or settle in the State, after the adoption of this Constitution.” In the early 20th century, mechanization of agriculture in the South stimulated immigration of blacks to large cities like Indianapolis. Migration accelerated in World War II, slowing only in the 1970s. Simultaneously, whites began to move out of the downtown areas to suburbs. Latinos were a small portion of Indiana's population prior to 1970. In any case the Census did not reliably track Latinos before the 1970 Census. The 2000 Census described 3.5% of Indiana's population as Latino. In the next decade, the state's Latino population grew at twice the national rate. In 2010, the state was 6.0% Latino. They have settled more-or-less evenly distributed across the state. ==School demographics== The demographics of schools in Indiana reflect the composition of the communities in which they are located. The average white student in Indiana is likely to attend a school where 81% of the students are white. The average black student is likely to attend a school where 68% of the students are non-white. ==Studies== Since 1996, the relative segregation of classrooms across the United States has been studied by the Civil Rights Project at Harvard until 2007 and subsequently at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at UCLA. In 2017, the Project cooperated to with Indiana University to study the conditions in the state. A 2012 UCLA study showed that Indiana had the sixth most segregated classrooms in America. ==School vouchers== Indiana has one of the largest school voucher programs in the United States. Critics contend that vouchers contribute to school segreation. Analysis of two recent studies on vouchers show that, in one case they do contribute to more segreation, and in the second, they have little effect, with black recipeients who had been in a majority-black public school used the vouchers to attend a majority-black private school. == References == Category:Education in Indiana Category:African-American history of Indiana Category:School segregation in the United States ","title":"Education segregation in Indiana"},{"id":"56035807","text":"Anastassios Christomanos (1841-1906) was a Greek chemist and considered the founder of proper chemistry science in Greece. == Biography == Christomanos was born in Vienna on March 22, 1841, to the well-known Greek descendance family of Manos (following the death of Christos Manos the family became known as Christomanos), from Melnik, Ottoman Empire (now part of Bulgaria) with deeper roots from the Katranitsa (Pyrgi) of Eordaia. His family had immigrated to Austria-Hungarian Empire and thrived as merchants. In 1855 his family left Vienna, but Anastasios remained to complete his studies. In 1858 he received his scholarship from Vienna's Highschool and gave a qualifying exam at the Vienna Technical University, which quickly left to continue at the German University of Giessen and then in Berlin. In 1859 he left Berlin and continued his studies in Karlsruhe, where he studied until 1861 to complete his studies at the University of Heidelberg. During his studies he was an assistant to several of his professors, and after his graduation, he worked in factories as a chemist. == Academic career == In 1862, he returned to Greece as a Doctor of Philosophy and was appointed to the Greek National Teaching School. In 1863, at the request of the then Minister of Education, Epaminondas Deligeorgis, he was first recruited as a lecturer and then taught chemistry at the University of Athens until 1906, while he became rector of the University from 1897 to 1898. In 1866 he participated in the committee of Greek experts who attended volcanic activity in Nea Kameni, Santorini. During his stay in Santorini he was promoted on 13 April 1866 from lecturer to assistant professor of General Chemistry at the University of Athens. The period from 18 January 1868 to 1906 was full Professor of General Chemistry at the University of Athens. During the academic year 1872-1873 he was dean of the School of Philosophy and in 1905-1906 of the School of Sciences. In 1887, the Central Chemistry Laboratory of the Greek state was established on Solonos street in Athens (now Old Chimion), in which Chrisomanos oversaw the construction. It started in 1889. On October 24, 1895, Chrisomannos, together with professors Konstantinos Mitsopoulos, Timoleon Argyropoulos, Spyridon Miliarakis, Nikolaos Apostolides and Anastasios Damvigis, filed a memorandum to the Greek state (all Greek Universities were and are public and subject of the ministry of education) proposing the formation of a Physical-Mathematical School, essentially separating the Departments of Physics and Mathematics from the Philosophical School. The separation was finally accomplished by Royal Decree on 3 June 1904. Christomanos represented Greece in several international scientific conferences, such as Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Budapest and Rome. In 1883 he undertook and supervised the work of public lighting in Athens. == Personal life == In 1866 he married Athena Lindenmayer, the daughter of the courtier of Greek palace, Bavarian doctor Anton Lindenmayer. From this marriage had four sons and a daughter. His son was the writer Konstantinos Chrisomannos. == Death == He died in Athens on October 2, 1906 from kidney cancer. == Scientific Work == His most important scientific work was the determination of the specific gravity of silver, methods for the determination of alkali metals, artificial biphenyl synthesis and the composition of chromite ores in Greece.

It is based on the rugby union match between the representative sides of Yorkshire and Lancashire played at Park Avenue, Bradford on 25 November 1893. It depicts the Yorkshire team in the all-white strip attacking while the Lancashire team in the hooped red and white jerseys and black shorts try to prevent a pass being made. The action on the pitch takes place in front of a packed stadium. ==History== The identity of the person who commissioned the portrait is unknown but it was completed by Wollen in 1895 and was exhibited at the 1896 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition (catalogue number 673) after which it was sold. It was one of the pieces selected to appear in Cassell's Royal Academy Pictures 1896 edition. It is known to have been on display in West Yorkshire soon after but the subsequent whereabouts of the portrait are unknown until 1957 when members of the Yorkshire Rugby Football Union found the portrait in a second-hand shop in Newcastle. They bought the picture for £25 and it was displayed in the Otley R.U.F.C. clubhouse until the 1960s when it was moved to its current location in the West stand at Twickenham Stadium. ==Ghost legend== After the picture was moved to Twickenham it was cleaned and restored. Photographs taken of the picture at this time show that at least one player who has subsequently been overpainted from the picture. One suggestion made was that Wollen painted out players who, in 1895, took part in the schism of rugby and left rugby union to join the Northern Rugby Football Union (later to become the Rugby Football League). The story of these ghosts took root and was repeated as the truth on TV and in the press until it was pointed out that had Wollen painted out all the players who moved codes that there would only be a couple of players left in the picture. Other suggestions are that the painter forgot to include the referee in the original and simply chose to replace one of the players with the referee figure or that the players were expected to make a financial donation to appear in the picture and the one who didn't pay up was removed from the final portrait. None of these suggestions has ever been substantiated and Wollen's motives for the changes are unknown. ==Accuracy== At least 11 of the players in the picture have been identified as taking part in the 1893 match but others who have been identified didn't, most notably Alf Barraclough, the player making the pass, and Thomas Dobson, the rightmost player in the picture. The referee in the picture has been identified as George Rowland Hill then the secretary of the Rugby Football Union but the actual referee of the game was T Potts from Durham. The game did not take place in weather as good as that depicted either and a contemporary newspaper reported that the game took place in drizzle and then heavier rain which coupled with a strong wind made for the \\"most miserable\\" conditions. ==References== Category:Rugby union mass media Category:County Championship (rugby union) Category:1895 paintings Category:Portraits by English artists Category:Sport in Bradford Category:Rugby union in Yorkshire Category:Rugby union in Lancashire ","title":"The Battle of the Roses"},{"id":"56035973","text":"Asmaa Ali al-Zarouni (also transliterated as Asma' al-Zar'uni and Asma al- Zarooni, born 1961) is the Librarian of Amani Library, Emirati librarian, poet, short story writer, and educator.

It was originally isolated from a culture of the algae Emiliania huxleyi, where it grows by breaking down dimethylsulfoniopropionate from E. hexleyi into dimethylsulfide and acrylate. M. thiooxydans has been implicated as a dominant organism in phytoplankton blooms, where it consumes dimethylsulfide, methanol and methyl bromide released by dying phytoplankton. It was also identified as one of the dominant organisms present in the plume following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and was identified as a major player in the breakdown of methanol in coastal surface water in the English channel. ==Metabolism== M. thiooxydans is a chemolithoheterotroph. Emiliania huxleyi produces dimethylsulfoniopropionate as an osmolyte to allow it to grow at the elevated salt concentrations in seawater, which is broken down by bacteria in the mixed-culture to release dimethylsulfide and acrylate - some bacteria can use the former as a carbon and energy source - taking some of the carbon up into biomass and mineralising the remainder into carbon dioxide and sulfate or thiosulfate. Most bacteria that degrade dimethylsulfide (including some Methylophaga strains) as a source of carbon leave the sulfur behind in the fully oxidised form of sulfate, whereas Methylophaga sulfidovorans forms thiosulfate as the end-product of growth. M. thiooxydans performs an additional step, using the cytochrome c-linked thiosulfate dehydrogenase to dimerise thiosulfate into tetrathionate, which yields electrons that can be transferred to the respiratory chain and used to produce ATP. The same is true for both the endogenous thiosulfate formed in this way or exogenous thiosulfate from the environment \\\\- in both cases, electrons from the thiosulfate dehydrogenase reduce cytochrome c and are then transferred to a cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase, from which they are transferred to molecular oxygen, which - as the terminal electron acceptor is reduced to water. The respiratory chain of this species contains a bc1 complex, unlike Escherichia coli and the flavoprotein succinate dehydrogenase, which is not always present in methylotrophic or autotrophic bacteria since they do not have the complete Krebs cycle, and instead have the partial cycle dubbed Smith's horseshoe - in the case of Methylophaga species, the fumarase and succinate dehydrogenase that are often missing are present and permit growth on a limited range of carbohydrates rather than just one-carbon compounds such as methanol or dimethylsulfide, which are metabolised not via Krebs cycle but via the ribulose monophosphate pathway (RuMP pathway, also known as the Quayle pathway).

A nucleus becomes excited by some nuclear process and then splits into lighter elements (fission products). This releases a small amount of neutrons and prompt gamma radiation, followed by the beta decay of the lighter nuclei with additional gamma radiation released. In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, the fission barrier is the activation energy required for a nucleus of an atom to undergo fission. This barrier may also be defined as the minimum amount of energy required to deform the nucleus to the point where it is irretrievably committed to the fission process. The energy to overcome this barrier can come from either neutron bombardment of the nucleus, where the additional energy from the neutron brings the nucleus to an excited state and undergoes deformation, or through spontaneous fission, where the nucleus is already in an excited and deformed state. It is important to note that efforts to understand fission processes are still an ongoing and have been a very difficult problem to solve since fission was first discovered by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938. While nuclear physicists understand many aspects of the fission process, there is currently no encompassing theoretical framework that gives a satisfactory account of the basic observations. ==Scission== The fission process can be understood when a nucleus with some equilibrium deformation absorbs energy (through neutron capture, for example), becomes excited and deforms to a configuration known as the \\"transition state\\" or \\"saddle point\\" configuration. As the nucleus deforms, the nuclear Coulomb energy decreases while the nuclear surface energy increases. At the saddle point, the rate of change of the Coulomb energy is equal to the rate of change of the nuclear surface energy. The formation and eventual decay of this transition state nucleus is the rate-determining step in the fission process and corresponds to the passage over an activation energy barrier to the fission reaction. When this occurs, the neck between the nascent fragments disappears and the nucleus divides into two fragments. The point at which this occurs is called the \\"scission point\\". ==Liquid drop model== From the description of the beginning of the fission process to the \\"scission point,\\" it is apparent that the change of the shape of the nucleus is associated with a change of energy of some kind. In fact, it is the change of two types of energies: (1) the macroscopic energy related to the nuclear bulk properties as given by the liquid drop model and (2) the quantum mechanical energy associated with filling the shell model orbitals. For the nuclear bulk properties with small distortions, the surface, E_s, and Coulomb, E_c, energies are given by: :E_s = E_s^0 (1 + \\\\frac{2}{5}\\\\alpha_2^2) :E_c = E_c^0 (1 - \\\\frac{1}{5}\\\\alpha_2^2) where E_s^0 and E_c^0 are the surface and Coulomb energies of the undistorted spherical drops, respectively, and \\\\alpha_2 is the quadrupole distortion parameter. When the changes in the Coulomb and surface energies (\\\\Delta E_c = E_c^0 - E_c, \\\\Delta E_s = E_s^0 - E_s) are equal, the nucleus becomes unstable with respect to fission. At that point, the relationship between the undistorted surface and Coulomb energies becomes: :x = \\\\frac{E_c^0}{2 E_s^0} where x is called the fissionability parameter. If x > 1, the liquid drop energy decreases with increasing \\\\alpha_2, which leads to fission. If x < 1, then the liquid drop energy decreases with decreasing \\\\alpha_2, which leads to spherical shapes of the nucleus. The Coulomb and surface energies of a uniformly charged sphere can be approximated by the following expressions: :E_c^0 = \\\\frac{3}{5} \\\\frac{Z^2 e^2}{R_0 A^{1/3}} = a_c \\\\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}} :E_s^0 = 4 \\\\pi R_0^2 S A^{2/3} = a_s A^{2/3} where Z is the atomic number of the nucleus, A is the mass number of the nucleus, e is the charge of an electron, R_0 is the radius of the undistorted spherical nucleus, S is the surface tension per unit area of the nucleus, a_c = 3e^2/5 R_0 and a_s = 4 \\\\pi R_0^2 S. The equation for the fissionability parameter then becomes: :x = \\\\left(\\\\frac{a_c}{2 a_s}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac{Z^2}{A}\\\\right) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{Z^2}{A}\\\\right)/\\\\left(\\\\frac{Z^2}{A}\\\\right)_{critical} where the ratio of the constant \\\\left(a_c/2 a_s\\\\right)^{-1} is referred to as \\\\left(Z^2/A\\\\right)_{critical}. The fissionability of a given nucleus can then be categorized relative to \\\\left(Z^2/A\\\\right). As an example, plutonium-239 has a \\\\left(Z^2/A\\\\right) value of 36.97, while less fissionable nuclei like bismuth-209 have a \\\\left(Z^2/A\\\\right) value of 32.96. For all stable nuclei, x must be less than 1. In that case, the total deformation energy of nuclei undergoing fission will increase by an amount (1/5) \\\\alpha_2^2 (2 E_s^0 - E_c^0), as the nucleus deforms towards fission. This increase in potential energy can be thought of as the activation energy barrier for the fission reaction. However, modern calculations of the potential energy of deformation for the liquid drop model involve many deformation coordinates aside from \\\\alpha_2 and represent major computational tasks. ==Shell corrections== In order to get more reasonable values for the nuclear masses in the liquid drop model, it is necessary to include shell effects. Soviet physicist Vilen Strutinsky proposed such a method using \\"shell correction\\" and corrections for nuclear pairing to the liquid drop model. In this method, the total energy of the nucleus is taken as the sum of the liquid drop model energy, E_{LDM}, the shell, \\\\delta S, and pairing, \\\\delta P, corrections to this energy as: :E = E_{LDM} + \\\\sum_{p,n}(\\\\delta S + \\\\delta P) The shell corrections, just like the liquid drop energy, are functions of the nuclear deformation. The shell corrections tend to lower the ground state masses of spherical nuclei with magic or near-magic numbers of neutrons and protons. They also tend to lower the ground state mass of mid shell nuclei at some finite deformation thus accounting for the deformed nature of the actinides. Without these shell effects, the heaviest nuclei could not be observed, as they would decay by spontaneous fission on a time scale much shorter than we can observe. This combination of macroscopic liquid drop and microscopic shell effects predicts that for nuclei in the U-Pu region, a double-humped fission barrier with equal barrier heights and a deep secondary minimum will occur. For heavier nuclei, like californium, the first barrier is predicted to be much larger than the second barrier and passage over the first barrier is rate determining. In general, there is ample experimental and theoretical evidence that the lowest energy path in the fission process corresponds to having the nucleus, initially in an axially symmetric and mass (reflection) symmetric shape pass over the first maximum in the fission barrier with an axially asymmetric but mass symmetric shape and then to pass over the second maximum in the barrier with an axially symmetric but mass (reflection) asymmetric shape. Because of the complicated multidimensional character of the fission process, there are no simple formulas for the fission barrier heights. However, there are extensive tabulations of experimental characterizations of the fission barrier heights for various nuclei. ==See also== *Cold fission *Nuclear fusion == References == Category:Nuclear physics Category:Nuclear chemistry Category:Otto Hahn Category:1938 in science Category:1938 in Germany ","title":"Fission barrier"},{"id":"56036050","text":"Prasophyllum plumiforme, commonly known as the dainty leek orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a small leek orchid with a single smooth, tubular leaf and up to fifty or more tiny cream-coloured or greenish-yellow flowers on a tall flowering stem. ==Description== Prasophyllum plumiforme is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single smooth, tube-shaped leaf which is long and in diameter. Between fifteen and fifty or more flowers are moderately crowded on a flowering stem long reaching to a height of . The flowers are cream-coloured to greenish-yellow, about long and wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is long and about wide and the lateral sepals are long and about wide and free from each other. The petals are about the same size as the lateral sepals and turn forwards. The labellum is about long, wide and turns obliquely upwards near its middle. The edges of the labellum are crinkled and there is a green callus along its centre. Flowering occurs from September to November. This leek orchid resembles P. ovale but is taller and has smaller, less crowded flowers. ==Taxonomy and naming== Prasophyllum plumiforme was first formally described in 1882 by Robert FitzGerald and the description was published in The Gardeners' Chronicle. The specific epithet (plumiforme) is derived from the Latin word pluma meaning \\"soft feather\\" or \\"down\\" with the suffix -forme meaning \\"shape\\", referring to the feather-like labellum. ==Distribution and habitat== The dainty leek orchid is widespread and often common in woodland and shrubland between Kalbarri and Israelite Bay. ==Conservation== Prasophyllum plumiforme is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. ==References External links == * plumiforme Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Plants described in 1882 ","title":"Prasophyllum plumiforme"},{"id":"56036056","text":"Sandar Church is located by Sandefjord Station.

Her father had a small advertising agency and her mother, Ruth H. Ewing, was a high school math teacher and homemaker. Hardy was the eldest of five children in a conservative Methodist family. She grew up in Evanston, Illinois. In 1951, Hardy graduated from Evanston Township High School. In 1955, Hardy graduated from Pomona College with a degree in physical education. She chose physical education because it was the only degree program which allowed her to take math and science courses after her desire to major in chemistry was stymied by the chemistry department head who was opposed to having women in the lab. Following her graduation, she took chemistry classes at Columbia University, but ultimately decided that a career in physical therapy had little appeal. On the advice of a friend working for IBM, she took the company's Programmer Aptitude Test when searching for a job. == Career == In 1956, Hardy entered the programming field after taking IBM's Programmer Aptitude Test. Her official title was System Service Girl, which is equivalent to the position of a current day system engineer. Hardy then switched to programming and worked in IBM Research, which was in Poughkeepsie, and then in Ossining, New York. She worked at IBM for five years. A job on the STRETCH supercomputer project led to an offer to work at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in 1962. Hardy was one of a team of five who worked on the Livermore STRETCH's Fortran compiler from 1963 to 1966. In February 1966, after her husband got a job at IBM in the Bay Area, Hardy got a job at Tymshare, a newly formed time-sharing company in Los Altos, California. She worked for Tymshare from 1966 to 1985. Hardy worked on some of the first time-sharing systems and computer networks, used by a variety of corporations and government agencies. In 1968 she, with her husband Norm Hardy and LaRoy Tymes, first used minicomputers to log onto mainframe computers. She eventually rose to vice-president, the first woman in that role. Though Hardy was solely responsible for the writing the code for Tymshare's time-sharing product, many of her male colleagues assumed her husband had written the OS. It wasn't until she was in the hospital giving birth to her first child, and her coworkers encountered problems that they did not know how to fix, that they began to defer to her as the expert on the system she had written. After Tymshare was acquired by McDonnell Douglas in 1984, she left to found KeyLogic, which sold the timesharing hardware and software developed at Tymshare, under a licensing arrangement, until changing market conditions forced its closure in the early 1990s. She subsequently co- founded Agorics, which focuses on web-based marketplace applications. Hardy's experiences are representative of the state of gendered labor in the field of computing during the mid to late 20th century: despite having technical skills and proving their value as workers, women in computing were continually undervalued as the field rose in power and importance. While at IBM, at one point Hardy learned that she was being paid less than one-half of the salary lowest ranked man who reported to her. As historians like Nathan Ensmenger, Janet Abbate, and Marie Hicks have shown, women programmers were denied credit for their work and historically submerged, leading to an inaccurate view of men's and women's roles in the field. In 2004, Hardy retired. She currently serves as co-chair of the Software Industry Special Interest Group at the Computer History Museum. ==Personal life== Hardy married, and later divorced, Norman Hardy, also an alumnus of IBM and Tymshare. She has two daughters, born in 1968 and 1970; one became an environmentalist and the other a costume designer. == References  Further reading == * == External links == * Oral History: Ann Hardy * Tymshare History Notes from Ann Hardy Category:1933 births Category:Pomona College alumni Category:American computer programmers Category:American women computer scientists Category:American computer scientists Category:IBM employees Category:People from California Category:People from Chicago Category:Living people ","title":"Ann Hardy"},{"id":"56036213","text":"Myrtilla Avery (1869–1959) was an American classical scholar focused on Medieval art, former chair of Department of Art at Wellesley College and director of the Farnsworth Art Museum from 1930–1937. == Biography == Avery graduated in 1891 from Wellesley College, majoring in Greek.

It was released in February 2017 under Father/Daughter Records. ==Composition== Musical style Kevin Lozano of Pitchfork defined Infinite Worlds as a \\"victorious...inimitable take on DIY indie rock.\\" AllMusic's Tim Sendra made note of several genres across the record, spanning \\"electro folk (\\"Fear & Force\\"), surging punk pop (\\"Minneapolis\\"), and strangled post-punk (\\"100 Years\\") to waltzing indie pop (\\"Cleaning House\\") and drifting ambient electronic pop (\\"Mal a L'aise\\").\\" The first track, \\"The Embers\\" was originally titled \\"Sharks\\". Lozano likened its sound to that of indie rock trio Built to Spill and art punk / indie rock octet Modest Mouse, noting its \\"anthemic steady guitars and booming drums\\" as hallmarks. The third track, \\"Fear & Force\\", contains backing vocals from fellow musician Greta Kline, known for her bedroom pop / indie pop project Frankie Cosmos. Exclaim's Max Mohenu defined it as a \\"wistful acoustic jam that ascends into lush synth flutters, brushing elbows with grungy reverb and steady kick drums on occasion.\\" \\"Mal a L'aise\\", the fourth track, is sung completely in vocalist Laetitia Tamko's native French, one of the languages spoken in her birth country of Cameroon. Deeming the track as \\"one of the most interesting tracks\\" on Infinite Worlds, Lazeno dubbed it \\"guazy, ambient pop, not unlike the Cocteau Twins\\" and \\"a sound collage made of a spectral chorus of voices, processed and multiplied.\\" Later, he noted it as \\"almost close to new age,\\" comparing it to the music of Grouper and Harold Budd. Mohenu described it simply as \\"atmospheric pop.\\" Lyrical content In the opinion of Pitchfork's Kevin Lozano, the record \\"is an album interested in grappling with seemingly intractable and very personal questions about sharing space, finding a home, and fostering community in a world that can be caustic to those very actions.\\" The record has also drawn comparisons to A Seat at the Table, the lauded third studio album by singer-songwriter and record producer Solange, though that record was rooted in significantly more neo soul and R&B; territory musically. The A.V.

He was a chestnut stallion with a flaxen mane and tail. He was sired by Harlinsdale Farm's Pride of Midnight; his grandsire was the two-time World Grand Champion Midnight Sun and his great-grandsire was the foundation horse Wilson's Allen. His dam was HF Spirit's Nell, who was sired by Spirit of Midnight. He was bred and foaled on Harlinsdale Farm and sold to Robert Lowe in 1977. Pride's Generator was trained by Gary Edwards. Ridden by Edwards, he won the Two-Year-Old World Championship in the 1978 Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration.

Beech Stables in Belfast, Tennessee, after being sold to Claude Crowley. Since shipped semen was not available at the time, his breedings were live cover. Later, when the technology to collect semen from the stallion became available, the Crowleys chose not to use it for Pride's Generator because he was fully booked every year without it. In 1995 they moved him to Waterfall Farms just outside Shelbyville. Pride's Generator was the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association leading sire for eight years in a row, and during his life sired over 2,300 foals. Among his offspring were many notable show horses, including two World Grand Champions and over 100 World Champions. His son Gen's Armed and Dangerous won the World Grand Championship in 1993, and his son Generator's Santana won the same honor in 1997. His daughter Gen's Sundance Lady was a thirteen-time World Champion, mostly in the youth division; his son Generator's Silver Dollar was Three-Year-Old World Champion and Four-Year-Old World Champion before having a notable stud career. The Skywatch was the 1995 Three-Year-Old World Champion.

Aunt Priscilla was a pseudonym for the columnist Eleanor Purcell of The Baltimore Sun. Purcell used the image of the Mammy archetype to create a cooking column called Aunt Priscilla's Recipes which was purported to be written by an African American woman. The daily column was written in an exaggerated dialect. == About == Aunt Priscilla purportedly was a daily food columnist for The Baltimore Sun and her column ran from the early 1920s through the 1940s. The columns were written as answers to culinary requests from readers of the newspaper and described how to cook traditional Southern recipes. The directions for the recipes were written with \\"inexperienced cooks or brides in mind,\\" according to The Baltimore Sun. Aunt Priscilla's columns were written in a dialect similar to Uncle Remus, according to writer, Alice Furlaud. Lisa Hix described the dialect as an \\"exaggerated slave dialect.\\" Each publication included an illustration of a woman that could be considered \\"Jemima-like,\\" according to Toni Tipton-Martin. In a 1951 book called The Amiable Baltimoreans, the author, Francis F. Beirne, refers to Aunt Priscilla as if she was a real person. In fact, the column was written by Eleanor Purcell, who was white. Purcell's work, according to Tipton-Martin, \\"was a form of minstrelsy,\\" but \\"it broke with the long tradition of simply taking and publishing African American recipes without giving black cooks credit.\\" Purcell started working at The Baltimore Sun in 1916 and Aunt Priscilla's Recipes was her first feature for the paper. In 1929, a compilation of recipes mostly featuring holiday themes was published. The book was called Aunt Priscilla in the Kitchen: A Collection of Wintertime Recipes. The column and the book both \\"are full of nostalgia for the old slave-owning south,\\" said Furlaud.

Validators run software allowing them to put transactions in blocks. The process is automated and does not require validators to be constantly monitoring their computers. It, however, does require maintaining the computer (the authority node) uncompromised. The term was coined by Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum and Parity Technologies. With PoA, individuals earn the right to become validators, so there is an incentive to retain the position that they have gained. By attaching a reputation to identity, validators are incentivized to uphold the transaction process, as they do not wish to have their identities attached to a negative reputation. This is considered more robust than PoS (proof-of-stake) - PoS, while a stake between two parties may be even, it does not take into account each party’s total holdings. This means that incentives can be unbalanced. On the other hand, PoA only allows non-consecutive block approval from any one validator, meaning that the risk of serious damage is centralized to the authority node. PoA is suited for both private networks and public networks, like POA Network, where trust is distributed. == References == Category:Algorithms Category:Blockchains ","title":"Proof of authority"},{"id":"56036562","text":"Provo Peak is a mountain peak in the Uinta National Forest in the Wasatch Range that is located within the city limits of Provo, Utah, United States.

JDCA was incorporated in Washington, D.C., in June 2017. ==Purpose== The organisation's official mission is to serve as the voice for Jewish Democrats. According to its website, JDCA “promotes like-minded candidates and elected officials and embraces a platform that is grounded in fairness, integrity, the Jewish value of Tikkun Olam and a strong U.S.-Israel relationship.” JDCA claims that it “serves as the voice for Jewish Democrats and the socially liberal, pro-Israel values that Jewish voters hold dear.” The organization's platform lists policies on numerous topics; among them are education, health care, paid family leave, taxes, climate change, Israel, Iran, fighting anti-semitism, Holocaust education, immigration, criminal justice reform and reproductive rights. ==Background== The JDCA was announced in August 2017 after President Donald Trump refused to condemn white nationalist and neo-nazi demonstrators for violence which took place during a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and formally launched in November 2017. Ron Klein, chair of the JDCA, has written that American Jews can not afford to be \\"complacent\\" in the wake of Donald Trump's election and must be \\"on the front-lines of fighting for justice and equality.\\" In his fundraising appeal for the JDCA, he wrote that \\"President Trump must be held accountable.\\" In its launch statement, JDCA said that it would \\"actively promote to Democratic officeholders and candidates national and local legislative policies consistent with the Jewish community’s values, as well as a strong US-Israel relationship\\". The organization's inaugural press release said that Trump's rhetoric and tolerance of neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and racists will \\"empower and embolden\\" such groups. It criticized the \\"deafening silence\\" from some members of Congress and Trump's cabinet and accused those who refuse to speak out of abdicating \\"their constitutional and moral obligation to our country and its citizens\\". U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) issued a statement saying he looks forward with working with the JDCA on \\"issues that are important to all Americans, including maintaining the strong U.S.-Israel relationship, curtailing Iran’s malign activities, and combating anti-Semitism.\\" ==Organization== The JDCA is chaired by former Florida congressman Ron Klein. In June 2018, JDCA announced it had hired its first executive director, Halie Soifer, a former staffer in the U.S. Senate and Congress. The board members are David Adler, Marc Stanley, Michael Adler, Carol Becker, Michael Gelman, Elaine Hamilton, Michael Horowitz, Barbara Goldberg Goldman, Israel Klein, Daniel Berger, Diane Feinberg, Peter Gillon, Benjamin Gordon, Steve Grossman, Ada Horwich, Beth Kieffer Leonard, Marcia Riklis, Joel Rubin, Jim Segel, Jeffrey Solomon, and Susie Stern. Several of the board members were also involved with the National Jewish Democratic Council and Jews for Progress. ==Launch event== JDCA's launch event was attended by many high-profile members of Congress including Nancy Pelosi, Ben Cardin, Tim Kaine, Chris Murphy, Sherrod Brown, Steny Hoyer, and Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Over 20 elected Democratic leaders spoke at the event, which drew some 250 people. Senator Cardin (D-Md.), who is a member of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, stated the Democratic Party's objection to imposing \\"religious tests for who can come to America,\\" but did not explicitly mention Trump's travel ban. Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer, who also attended the event, said the group was a \\"strategic asset\\" for Israel. Although Republicans have accused Democrats of moving away from their traditionally pro-Israel positions, Dermer disagreed saying that support for Israel within the Democratic Party was still strong. ==Endorsements== In June 2018, the JDCA announced its first round of endorsements for the 2018 midterm elections. The four candidates who received endorsements were, Bill Nelson, Jacky Rosen, Sean Casten, and Dean Phillips. The JDCA followed that set of endorsements with six more: Claire McCaskill, Sherrod Brown, Conor Lamb, Josh Gottheimer, Mikie Sherrill, and Tom Malinowski. ==Response from Republican groups== The Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC) sent an email to its supporters saying that JDCA was founded to revitalize two \\"failed liberal Jewish political groups.\\" The RJC also said that founding a new organization would not reverse \\"the continued erosion of support for Israel within the Democrat Party.\\" The JDCA responded by calling the letter \\"pitiful.\\" ==References== Category:Democratic Party (United States) organizations Category:Jewish lobbying Category:Jewish-American political organizations ","title":"Jewish Democratic Council of America"},{"id":"56036669","text":"Ruislip Football Club was a semi-professional football club based in Ruislip, West London.

Cortona, Museo dell’Accademia Etrusca, ca. 300-250 BCE. Culsans (Culśanś) is an Etruscan deity, known from two inscriptionsRix and Meiser 2014: Co 3.4, Co 4.11. and a variety of iconographical material which includes coins, statuettes, and a sarcophagus.Krauskopf “Culsans,” LIMC 3 (1986) 306-308. Culśanś is usually rendered as a male deity with two facesSimon (1985), 1275. and at least two statuettes depicting him have been found in close association with city gates.van der Meer (1987), 149. These characteristics suggest that he was a protector of gateways, who could zealously watch over the gate with not one, but two pairs of eyes. Many scholars recognize the deity, Janus, as a Roman equivalent to Culśanś because he is also rendered as a bifrons (two-faced god) and his divine realm also includes the protection of doorways and gates.Simon, in de Grummond & Simon (2006), 58van der Meer (1987), 79Bonfante & Bonfante (2002), 197. Building on this idea, some scholars have proposed that the name Culśanś may contain an etymological root meaning “door” in Etruscan, just as Janus’ name comes from the Latin word for door, ianua.Simon, in de Grummond & Simon (2006), 58Krauskopf (1986), 307van der Meer (2011), 100. An Etruscan female deity named, Culśu, whose name has the same etymological root as Culśanś, is also associated with gateways, though in her case, they are gateways of the netherworld.de Grummond (2006), 147Bonfante & Bonfante (2002), 197. ==Iconographical Evidence== Etruscan For the most part, iconography of Culśanś is geographically limited to Northern Etruria and chronologically limited to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE of the Hellenistic Period.Krauskopf (1986), 308. Many of the artifacts associated with Culśanś, come from the city of Cortona, suggesting that he had a particularly important presence there.van der Meer (1987), 79. His rendering on coins from Volterra and his inclusion in a dedicatory inscription found in Fiernzuola, however, preclude the notion that his worship was limited to Cortona.Krauskopf (1986), 308. ==Appearance== Not all renderings of Culśanś are the same, but based on the available evidence, he is most often represented as a youthful, beardless deity with two faces, wearing nothing but a pair of rustic boots and a cap.Maggiani (1998), 2 This rendering of Culśanś is best represented by a bronze statuette from Cortona which dates to the 3rd or 2nd century BCE. In this statuette, he is shown nude, in a contrapposto stance with one hand on his hip. Some scholars think that his right hand originally held a rustic staff akin to the one often held by Roman Janus,van der Meer (1987), 79. while others propose that it would have held a key, an appropriate attribute for a gatekeeper and one that was also associated with images of Janus.Simon, in de Grummond & Simon (2006)Simon (1985), 1275. In addition to his rustic boots, and the flat cap that stretches over both of his heads, he also wears a torque necklace.de Grummond (2006), 147. The statuette is clearly identified by an inscription, running up the statue’s left thigh, which translates to: “Velia Cuinti, Arnt’s (daughter) to Culśanś (this object) gladly gave.”Bonfante, in de Grummond & Simon (2006), 16. It was found buried near the north gate in Cortona together with a similar statuette representing and dedicated to the god Selvans.van der Meer (1987), 79. Selvans is rendered in a very similar manner to Culśanś; he too takes a contrapposto stance with one arm akimbo and his other arm extended to hold something. He is also naked except for his boots, a torque and a cap, and he bears a similar inscription from the same dedicator (Velia Cuinti).van der Meer (1987), 79. Krauskopf points out that since the two figures both wear boots and a torque in common, these items are not likely special clothing, characteristic of either god in particular.Krauskopf (1986), 308. The two Cortona figures are different in that Selvans only has one face and wears a different style cap which seems to be made from an animal skin of some sort, possibly from a lion or a wolf.van der Meer (1987), 61. Selvans is equated by some scholars to the Roman god Silvanus.de Grummond (2006), 149. Selvans, like Culśanś is probably a god who protected boundaries, liminal spaces, gates and doorways.de Grummond (2006), 149van der Meer (1987), 61. Another noteworthy aspect of these two Cortona figures, is the way their hands, and especially, their fingers are positioned. There is a passage by the Roman author Pliny the Elder in which he describes a statue of Janus where his fingers are positioned to represent the 365 (CCCLXV) days of the year.Pliny NH, 34.33. This has led many scholars to consider whether the finger positions of the Cortona statuettes may also be significant.Simon (1985), 1280de Grummond (2006), 147Maggiani (1998), 6. If the finger positions were meant to render a number value related to the calendar, it could suggest that Culśanś had an association with time and the cycle of the year just like Janus. The typical portrayal of Culśanś and Selvans as beardless youths exemplified by these Cortona figures stands in contrast to renderings of their Roman counterparts, Janus and Silvanus, who are usually shown as bearded, older men. Three coins from Volterra, all dating to the 3rd or 2nd c. BCE, also depict Culśanś as a youthful, beardless bifrons.Krauskopf (1986), 306. Krauskopf includes a 2nd c. BCE terracotta bust from Vulci of a double-faced bearded figure on her list of possible representations of Culśanś.Krauskopf (1986), 307. This figure is more easily likened to representations of Janus, but some scholars have questioned the bust’s identification as Culśanś.Maggiani (1998), 2. Culśanś also differs from Janus in most of his representations, in that he wears a special cap.Krauskopf (1986), 308. Some scholars have compared it to a petasos, the traveller’s hat worn by the Greek god, Hermes.Krauskopf (1986), 308Maggiani (1998), 6. Others see a possible connection to the galerus, a special hat worn by Roman priests which the Romans likely adopted from the Etruscans.Simon (1985), 1275. Stone sarcophagus from Tuscania. Tuscania, Museo Archeologico, ca. 300 BCE. Showing a bifrons, probably Culśanś, in battle. A (possible) representation of Culśanś that is of a very different nature than the Cortona figure, occurs on a stone sarcophagus from Tuscania, dating to 300 BCE.Krauskopf (1986), 308. This sarcophagus shows an older, bearded bifrons wielding a sickle blade in a scene of combat. The imagery has been interpreted as relating to quite differing narratives. Maggiani identifies the two-faced figure as the Greek mythological guard called Argos.Maggiani (1998), 3. De Grummond, on the other hand, recognizes the figure as Culśanś and interprets the imagery as a Gigantomachy scene in which Culśanś plays a role.de Grummond (2006), 148. Inscriptions Apart from the inscription on the leg of the Cortona bronze statuette,Rix and Meiser (2014): Co 3.4. the other known reference to Culśanś is a fragmentary inscription on a small, partially incomplete slate from Firenzuolo.Rix and Meiser (2014): Co 4.11. The inscription was probably a dedication made to the god which was inscribed on a tablet so that it could be attached to a votive offering.Pfiffig (1975), 246. An abbreviated inscription on the Bronze Liver from Piacenza which reads “Cvl alp” might refer to Culśanś but it could also refer to Culśu.van der Meer (1987), 149. The liver includes references to approximately 28 deities whose various names are organized into 16 compartments marked out on the liver, each of which reflects a different region of the heavens.van der Meer (1987), 165. Van der Meer argues that it is more likely that “Cvl” inscription on the liver is an abbreviation for Culśu because the region on which the inscription occurs, includes several deities associated with the underworld; since of the two, only Culśu has evidence for being an underworld deity it would make more sense for her to be represented.van der Meer (1987), 80. There are a few additional inscriptions that include the root –cul / -cvl, but these are likely names.van der Meer (1987): SE 40, SE 8, SE 36, CII 938, CIE 5598. ==Foreign Equivalents== Many Etruscan scholars are hesitant to fully equate Etruscan deities with other gods. For example, Erika Simon, while recognizing the value of making comparisons to non-Etruscan gods, stresses that Etruscan deities are rarely exact equivalents of a Greek or Roman deity. To avoid confusion she recommends using Etruscan forms of a divinity’s name to avoid making unwarranted assumptions.Simon, in de Grummond & Simon (2006), 56. In a similar vein, Adriano Maggiani points out that while myths and iconography frequently migrate from one culture to another, the meaning and connotations associated with those mythological images can be drastically altered to suit the needs of the culture that adopts them.Maggiani (1998), 2. Nevertheless, a number of comparisons have been made between Culśanś and other foreign divinities. Pfiffig, drawing on Goetze, sees the name Culśanś as having an etymological root that means “watch, see or keep an eye on”.Pfiffig (1975), 246. He considers Culśanś as related to the Umbrian Spector and possibly to other double-faced watchmen gods coming from Babylonia, though he does point out that no two equivalent gods are exactly alike.Pfiffig (1975), 246 Simon argues that the iconography for two-faced deities originally came from the East during the Archaic period, perhaps via cauldron protomes.Simon (1985), 1278. Maggiani sees a parallel between Culśanś and the Greek deity, Argos, whom Hera placed as a watchful guardian over Io after she had been turned into a cow. He is often depicted as a creature with many eyes, but he can also be rendered with two faces. Maggiani sees this two-headed, sleepless watchman as a possible parallel to Culśanś.Maggiani (1998), 7. ==CitationsReferences== Bonfante, G. & Bonfante, L. (2002).

It runs from Store Kongensgade in the east to Rigensgade in the west, intersecting the streets Borgergade, Adelgade/Sankt Pauls Plads, Gammelvagt and Kronprinsessegade on the way. The street is closed to through traffic on the west side of Borgergade. It is named after the navel officer Olfert Fischer who commanded the Danish fleet in the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801. ==History== Ulvegade in 1877 The street with 1880 The main entrance of Søetatens Gospital in Balsamgade Olfert Fischers Gade traces its history back to Christian IV's foundation of Nyboder navel barracks in 1931 but different sections of it were then known under individual names. The section from Store Kongensgade was called Bryggerlængen (The Brewer Row), presumedly because a brewery was located at the site. The section from Borgergade to Adelgade was called Ulvegade (Wolf Street) and the section from Adelgade was called Balsamgade. The streets in Nyboder were named after animals and plants. These two names followed Christian IV's decision to name the streets in the eastern part of Nyboder after animal species and the streets in the western part after plant spacies. The area was located outside the city until Copenhagen's East Rampart was moved in 1661. This had already been planned by Christian IV but had been delayed due to lack of funding. Søetatens Hospital that replaced Søkvæsthuset, a navel hospital, was from 1806 located in Balsamgade. It closed in 1864. Nyboder's police station and jailhouse was located just around the corner in Adelgade. Adelgade then crossed the street a little further to the west, where Gammelvagt runs today, but the street was straightened in the 1990s. The three streets were jointly named Olfert Fischers Gade in 1897. This was done at the initiative of city engineer Thorvald Krak to reduce the number of street names in the city. ==Notable buildings and residents== Np. 5-7 The three small townhouses at No. 5-7 are among the oldest buildings in the street and have been listed on the Danish Registry of Protected Buildings and Places. No. 5 dates from the early 18th century, Ut is built over eight bays in two storeys and has a three-bay gabled wall dormer. No. 7 consists of two townhouses. The eastern one was originally built at some point before 1740 but was heightened between 1740 and 1766. The one to the west dates from before 1767 but was adapted with a Mansard roof some time 1767 and 1788between. Classic yellow Nyboder houses to the left and a Grey Row to the right The central portion of the street, between Borgergade and Adelgade, is lined with Nyboder houses but do not date from Christian IV's original development but represent later models. On the south side of the street (No. 19-37) is an example of the two-storey yellow terraces that are not most commonly associated with the development. It dates from the 1750s and was designed by Philip de Lange. On the north side of the street (No. 16-32 ), is an example of the so-called Grey Roys (or New Rows) that were built in the late 1880s and early 1890s to design by Olaf Schmidth and Rasmus Rue. The new design was inspired by Arbejdernes Byggeforening's building society houses. ==References * Olfert Fischers Gade at indenforvoldene.dk Category:Streets in Copenhagen ","title":"Olfert Fischers Gade"},{"id":"56036721","text":"P Gay Mountain is a mountain located in Adirondack Mountains of New York located in the Town of Indian Lake east of Indian Lake. ==References== Category:Mountains of Hamilton County, New York Category:Mountains of New York (state) ","title":"P Gay Mountain"},{"id":"56036730","text":"Starbuck Mountain is a mountain located in Adirondack Mountains of New York located in the Town of Indian Lake east of Indian Lake. ==References== Category:Mountains of Hamilton County, New York Category:Mountains of New York (state) ","title":"Starbuck Mountain"},{"id":"56036736","text":"Wisconsin has some of the most segregated schools in the United States. Despite laws demanding school integration, a 2012 study by the UCLA Civil Rights Project found that Wisconsin still has significant segregation in its classrooms. Almost half of black students in Wisconsin attend a school where 90% or more of the students are non-white. ==Background== Wisconsin became a state in 1848. Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) legitimized separate but equal as national policy. After Brown v. Board of Education, the state still needed a legal push. Amos, et al. v. Board of School Directors of the City of Milwaukee (1965) was the beginning in Wisconsin. National policy came in 1971 in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education which relied on the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The federal answer was court-ordered busing. Meanwhile, Amos was appealed in 1976, and ended up in the United States Supreme Court as Brennan v. Armstrong (1977). The decision of the circuit court of appeals was remanded back to the original court. Finally, United States District Judge John W. Reynolds Jr. oversaw a five-year plan for the Milwaukee school Board to desegregate the schools. In Wisconsin, busing began in 1981. ==Demographics== Citizens of Wisconsin describe themselves as being more white than the rest of the country. In the 2010 Census, 86.2% reported being white, compared with 73.8 for the nation as a whole. Wisconsin had never been a slave state. The 1860 Census reported a state population of 775,881. Of those, 1,711 were colored, all free. By 1900, that number had grown only to 2,500. The black population of Wisconsin grew substantially in the 20th century to 6% today. ==School demographics== The demographics of schools in Wisconsin reflect the composition of the communities in which they are located. Today, 71% of the state's black population lives in Milwaukee County, where they make up 41% of the population. As a result, the numbers for the rest of the state are skewed by schools in Milwaukee whose percentage is black population is far higher than the rest of the state. ==Studies== Since 1996, the relative segregation of classrooms across the United States has been studied by the Civil Rights Project at Harvard until 2007 and subsequently at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at UCLA. A 2016 UCLA study showed that 45.3% of black students in Wisconsin attend a school that is 90% or more non-white. Only six states had a higher percentage. ==School vouchers== School vouchers were introduced in Milwaukee in 1990. Indiana has one of the largest school voucher programs in the United States. Critics contend that vouchers contribute to school segregation. Analysis of two recent studies on vouchers show that, in one case they do contribute to more segregation, and in the second, they have little effect, with black recipients who had been in a majority-black public school using the vouchers to attend a majority-black private school. == References == Category:Public education in Wisconsin Category:African-American history of Wisconsin Category:School segregation in the United States Category:History of racism in Wisconsin ","title":"Education segregation in Wisconsin"},{"id":"56036750","text":"Paul Kipchumba, in Chinese Chen Pu (陈朴), is a Kenyan author, businessman and philanthropist born on 30 April 1983 in Elgeyo Marakwet County, Kenya.

He observes that there is need to advance a political system that accord with Africa’s material and intellectual poverty. In this book he says that African countries should formulate policies on how to tap aid from China. ==ReferencesCategory:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Kenyan business executives ","title":"Paul Kipchumba"},{"id":"56036760","text":"The Land of Hope is a lostThe Library of Congress/FIAF American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog:The Land of Hope 1921 American drama film directed by Edward H.

The Hathibada inscription were found near Nagari village, about north of Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, India, while the Ghosundi inscription was found in the village of Ghosundi, about southwest of Chittorgarh. They are linked to Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism. ==Description== Dated to the 1st-century BCE, the Hathibada Ghosundi Inscriptions are among the oldest known Sanskrit inscriptions in Brahmi script from the Hindu tradition of ancient India, particularly Vaishnavism. Some scholars, such as Jan Gonda, have dated these to the 2nd century BCE. The Hathibada Ghosundi Inscriptions were found in the same area, but not exactly the same spot. One part was discovered inside an ancient water well in Ghosundi, another at the boundary wall between Ghosundi and Bassi, and the third on a stone slab in the inner wall of Hathibada. The three fragments are each incomplete, but studied together. They are believed to have been displaced because the Mughal emperor Akbar during his seize of Chittorgarh camped at Nagari, built some facilities by breaking and reusing old structures, a legacy that gave the location its name \\"Hathi-bada\\" or \\"elephant stable\\". The part discovered in the Hathibada wall has the same style, same Brahmi script, and partly same text as the Ghosundi well text, thereby suggesting a link.D. R. Bhandarkar, Hathi-bada Brahmi Inscription at Nagari, Epigraphia Indica Vol. XXII, Archaeological Survey of India, pages 198-205 Religious significance The inscription is significant not only for its antiquity but as a source of information about ancient Indian scripts, the society, its history and its religious beliefs. It confirms the ancient reverence of Hindu deities Samkarshana and Vāsudeva (also known as Balarama and Krishna), an existence of stone temple dedicated to them in 1st-century BCE, the puja tradition, and a king who had completed the Vedic Asvamedha sacrifice. The inscription also confirms the association of the two deities Samkarshana and Vāsudeva with Narayana (Vishnu), possibly a step in their full incorporation into the Vaishnaite pantheon as avatars of Vishnu. Taken together with independent evidence such as the Besnagar inscription found with Heliodorus pillar, the Hathibada Ghosundi Inscriptions suggest that one of the roots of Vaishnavism in the form of Bhagavatism was thriving in ancient India between the 2nd and 1st century BCE. They are not the oldest known Hindu inscription, however. Others such as the Ayodhya Inscription and Nanaghat Cave Inscription are generally accepted older or as old. ==Inscription== The discovered inscription is incomplete, and has been interpolated based on Sanskrit prosody rules. It reads: > Fragment A Fragment A (Ghosundi stone inscription). 1 ..... tēna Gājāyanēna > P(ā)rāśarlputrāṇa Sa- 2 .....

His proposal was: > Fragment A (extrapolated) 1 (Karito=yam rajna Bhagava)tena Gajayanena > Parasariputrena Sa- 2 (rvatatena Asvamedha-ya)jina bhagava[d*]bhyaih > Samkarshana-Vasudevabhyam 3 (anihatabhyarh sarvesvara)bhyam pujasila-prakaro > Narayana-vatika. – D.

He is currently Professor Emeritus of Music Composition at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, having served as Director of the university's Experimental Music Studios for 40 years. Wyatt also served as President of the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States (SEAMUS) from 1989 through 1996, and is the recipient of the 2018 SEAMUS Award. == Music == Wyatt describes his compositional approach as \\"gestural\\", in that he constructs linear motives that allow \\"the listener a desired opportunity to discover the interplay and development of molded sonic events without the interference of pitch as the primary factor.\\" He asserts that clarity in motivic gestures and their evolutionary development enhances the drive, direction, and drama of a piece. While many of his early electroacoustic works employ sounds derived from synthesizers such as those developed by Moog and Buchla, Wyatt has since shifted to the musique concrète approach of utilizing found sounds. Wyatt records all of his sonic material in a studio in order to have complete control over the sculpting process, finding the exploration of the inherent gestural potential of a sound \\"revealing\\" and \\"exciting\\". With regard to spatialization, Wyatt opts for a manual approach to achieve effective, convincing translations — \\"the perceived movement of the location of a sound source\\" — across a multichannel field, finding it easier to emphasize such movement than by using multichannel panner utilities. He strongly feels that sonic entities that move must at first imply motion, and that it is the composer/engineer's responsibility to ensure that the translation of sounds along with the characteristics of their host environments remain at all times believable. == Biography == Wyatt studied classical piano as a child, though in high school began \\"living a double life of playing keyboards and bass in rock bands,\\" learning to build his own amplifiers and speaker cabinets as his family did not have the money to afford them. While an avid enthusiast of both technology and music, he was only vaguely aware of synthesizers through their occasional appearance in the commercial music industry. As a freshman studying music education and piano performance at West Chester University in 1970, Wyatt had access to a new Moog Series 900 synthesizer, though it did not have a user manual. Due to his experience with building his own electronic music equipment and performing in bands, Wyatt was able to fully explore the capabilities of the instrument and write a manual for West Chester faculty and students to use. It was during this time that Wyatt came to know the music of composers such as Milton Babbitt, John Cage, Edgard Varèse, and Iannis Xenakis, and was immediately drawn to it. This led him to seek composition lessons under John Melby and Larry Nelson. After graduating from West Chester University, Wyatt was admitted to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1974 as a graduate student, reuniting with and once again studying under John Melby (who had joined the university's composition division faculty the previous year). Wyatt was also a student of Herbert Brün, Ben Johnston, Salvatore Martirano, and Paul Zonn. Wyatt was quickly hired on as a lecturer the following year, teaching music theory, aural skills, and an electronic music course. He also served that year as co-director of the Experimental Music Studios alongside faculty member James Beauchamp, assuming sole directorship in 1976. Wyatt would continue to direct the Experimental Music Studios until 2016. In addition to his duties at the University of Illinois, Wyatt has been an active figure in the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States (SEAMUS), serving as its President from 1989 through 1996 and on its Board of Directors until 2016. Wyatt has been the recipient of many awards and honors throughout his career. He was one of the winning participants of the 1978 International Society for Contemporary Music National Composers Competition, the 1979 National Flute Association Composition Competition, and the 1979 Concorso Internazionale Luigi Russolo Composition Competition. He won the International Confederation of Electro-Acoustic Music GRAND PRIZE in the 1984 International Electro-Acoustic Music Competition in Bourges, France, and emerged as a finalist in the 1989 Bourges Competition. Wyatt has also received recognition and funding for advancements in the field of electroacoustic music composition, including an Arnold Beckman Research Award in 1990 for the development of digital timescaling applications, and various grants from 1996 through 2011 for the development of an eight-channel sound diffusion methodology. In 2008, he was awarded a Fine and Applied Arts Creative Research Award for the production of Risky Business: a tribute to Nikola Tesla, a composition featuring two 900,000-volt Tesla Coils. He has also successfully pursued many university grants for digital image processing, a 1994 Educational Technologies Assistance Grant, and several university-sponsored special projects grants for course development. On 7 December 2017, SEAMUS announced that Scott Wyatt will be honored with the 2018 SEAMUS Award, an accolade that \\"acknowledges the important contributions of its recipients to the field of electro-acoustic music.\\" == Recordings == * 2017.

The first was to rebuild the economy, which deteriorated sharply during the last years of Nationalist Party (KMT) governing. The strategy that led CCP to state power is termed as “using the rural areas to encircle the cities” (). Thus, one difficulty CCP had in economy was that it had little experience in dealing with the urban part of the economy.Brown, Jeremy. 2010. Dilemmas of victory: the early years of the People's Republic of China. Cambridge Mass: Harvard Univ. Press. Chapter 1 Furthermore, facing the threat of KMT's fighting back, it needed to consolidate its political power. To meet these challenges, a new and coherent wage system in the economic sector was needed. Naturally, this transformation of wage system had both political goals and economic goals. Economically, via setting up a new wage system, CCP wanted to stabilize the economic situation, to ensure normal people's everyday living and also to further develop the economy. Politically, CCP not only wanted to distinguish itself from the old GMD regime by this new wage system, but also to make the wage system suitable for the future socialist economy. After two wage reforms in 1952 and 1956, a new wage system was established, and its influence continued to today. == Background ==  Old Payment System  Before CCP came to power, wage systems of the CCP ruled area and of GMD ruled area were totally different. In CCP ruled area, the wage system was organized in form of so-called provisioning system or supply system (), under which workers, soldiers, cadres and other employees were supplied with a certain amount of daily necessities and foods to meet their basic needs. Although there were ranks in the supply system, the inequality was very small compared to other wage systems during that period in China.杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37. On the other hand, in the GMD ruled area, there was no national-wide unified wage system. In the previous government- owned enterprises, public services and some private-owned enterprises, the wage system was based on ranks and levels. In this old wage system, numerous levels existed. While the difference between two levels next to each other might be little, the difference between two ends in it was huge. For example, before 1949, the Shi Jin Shan Steel Factory had more than one hundred wage levels, and the difference between two adjacent levels only equaled 0.5 kilogram millet.Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page30 After CCP seized the power, the difference between various payment systems did not disappear immediately. Instead, they co-existed for a period. The CCP kept the provisioning system, although some modification like the overall rationing system () was introduced. In the overall rationing system, the goods supplied was converted to cash and paid to the cadre one time per month. Meanwhile, for most former employees in the public services and former state-owned factories, they were kept in their previous posts under the guidance of “the same rank, the same payment” ().Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Jing Ji Dang an Zi Liao Xuan Bian, 1949-1952. Beijing: Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, 1994. Page463 This co-existing of the two systems created administrative difficulties for the new regime. More importantly, the differences between the real incomes in these two systems also generated discontent and other problems within CCP's cadres.杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37. Under such conditions, CCP decided to transform the wage system and make it more suitable for future development.  Reforms to a Unified Wage System  In the central level, CCP took a series of reforms in order to gradually build a national-wide unified wage system. Some reforms were implemented locally in early “Liberated Areas”(), such as Northeast China (东北), before nationwide reforms took places. The first of these national reforms took place from 1950 to 1952, in which an intermediate form of wage, wage point, was introduced. In 1956, the wage point and the provisioning system were officially replaced by a money wage hierarchy system based on rank. It happened almost at the same time when the socialist transformation finished, and was also a part of the first 5 Years Plan. == Wage Hierarchy System Based on Rank () == From 1956 to 1976 (and also later), the Chinese wage system was based on a model called \\"wage hierarchy system based on rank\\" (). Although details such as the form of wage and the differences between levels varied through this periods, the main features of this system remained constant.Schran, Peter. 1974. “Institutional Continuity and Motivational Change: the Chinese Industrial Wages System, 1950-1973.” Asian Survey 14(11):1014–32. and its influence remain till present.  Learning from the Soviet Union  The establishment of wage hierarchy based on ranks was influenced heavily by the Soviet Union. Beyond the common ideology of PRC and USSR that brought similarities in the wage system,Schran, Peter. 1964. “Unity and Diversity of Russian and Chinese Industrial Wage Policies.” The Journal of Asian Studies 23(2):245. there were more direct influences from the Soviet Union on this issue. Such influence even existed in the Yan’an period (footnote), when Stalin did not trust, or at least was unsure of CCP's ability to win the Chinese Civil War.杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37. As the outcome of the civil war became clearer, the Soviet Union's direct involvement began to play a more important role. The Soviet Union's influence on the wage system came in two ways: it first came into China via management on the work floor level in the Northeast, where the Soviet Union occupied after the Japanese surrendered. Due to this, the Northeast was the first place that implemented the wage hierarchy system based on rank and also piecework wage.Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Before the CCP won the deciding Liaoshen Campaign, Soviet Union set up several joint enterprises in Northeast. In these enterprises, wage rank was implemented.徐, 公民. \\"全国实行八级工资制始末.\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20171208074823/http://www.mohrss.gov.cn/ltxgbj/LTXGBJlaoyousuole/201207/t20120720_84483.html Later, after the emancipation of the whole Northeast for the Nationalist Party in 1948, the reform was carried out under the direction of Soviet's consultants,杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37. Page117 and employees’ were classified into 9 ranks and 39 levels.Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page46 After the founding of the PRC, the Soviet Union's influence came through high-level policy design. In the early 1950s, the PRC took the Soviet Union as its model in socialist development. As part of such learning, in 1956 wage reform, it almost copied every element of the Soviet Union's wage system.Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page72 At least two Soviet experts directly participated in drafting the new wage rank system.Li, Weiyi. Zhongguo Gong Zi Zhi Du. Beijing Shi: Zhongguo lao dong chu ban she, 1991. Page30 After 1956 reform, both countries had a wage hierarchy of 7 or 8 grades.Schran, Peter. 1964. “Unity and Diversity of Russian and Chinese Industrial Wage Policies.” The Journal of Asian Studies 23(2):245. Like other Soviet's models in China, this wage system soon met its practical limits and also political challenges. Just one year later, the CCP began to modify this system in order to meet its own ideological ends and practical conditions.  Principles of the Wage Hierarchy System  The Soviet Union's influence was embodied in the general principles of the wage system and its technical details. The wage system in the socialist regime was not only a method of redistribution, but also was designed as an organic part of the state developmental machine. In other words, like any other wage system, it was both political and economical. Politically, it aimed at creating a more equal society that fits the vision of socialist society. Following Marx's conception of the communist society, CCP held that the optimal principle of distribution is “distribution according to need” (). The need mentioned here was determined by the nature of the society.Schran, Peter. 1964. “Unity and Diversity of Russian and Chinese Industrial Wage Policies.” The Journal of Asian Studies 23(2):245. However, the socialist period is still a transitive period towards the communist society. It is transitive in two senses: in the sense of forces of production and also in the sense of social consciousness. The Marxism's orthodox discussion about productivity and social consciousness is expressed as “the economic base determines the superstructure”.Williams, R. 1991. “Base and Superstructure in Marxist Cultural Theory.” Rethinking Popular Culture. Due to the low level of economic development in China, there were different kinds of ownership existing during this period, making the market remain a necessary mediation between different parts of the economy. More importantly, according to this thought, the social consciousness is still undeveloped due to the backwards in the economy.Schran, Peter. 1964. “Unity and Diversity of Russian and Chinese Industrial Wage Policies.” The Journal of Asian Studies 23(2):245. Page 245 Thus people were supposed to continue being guided by the commodity exchange. During this transitive period, the “distribution according to need” is impossible. Alternatively, the general principle in it was called “distribution according to labor” (). Economically, the principle of “distribution according to labor” aspired to encourage people to work harder in order to industrialize an undeveloped country. Concerning the economic issue, in this high level of institutional design, the 1956 wage hierarchy system aimed at achieving two seemly contradicting goals: on the one hand, it attempted to save the state's expenditures in paying employees’ salaries; on the other hand, it sought to encourage workers to work harder in building the socialism. In order to achieve these goals, it had to expand the gap between grades and levels, distinguish different economic sectors and also use the piecework wage as a material initiative. These measures finally brought it in conflicts with the socialist ideology in general and Mao's conception of socialism in specific.  Thrift and Incentives  The wage hierarchy based on rank was designed to save wages and incentivize workers at the same time. For the saving part, it was a part of what the CCP called reasonable low wage system ().周, 恩来. \\"关于劳动工资和劳动福利政策的意见.\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20171212225030/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66664/4493153.html In discussing the significance and principles of 1956 wage reform, Li Fu Chun, drawing the distinction between consumption fund and accumulation fund, argued that the accumulation fund has the priority in developing the economy. The growth rate of wage, which is main consisting part of the consumption fund, should be smaller than the growth rate of productivities. Only via this mean, the accumulation fund can grow fast and make the economy growth faster.李,富春. \\"工资改革的意义及改革的原则.\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20171212225248/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66662/4493091.html Zhou En Lai stated that the first goal of this low wage system was to ensure employees’ basic needs for living. It must suit the low level of industrial and agricultural development of China at the time.周, 恩来. \\"关于劳动工资和劳动福利政策的意见.\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20171212225030/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66664/4493153.html Along this line of think, one way that could encourage workers to work harder under the low wage system was to highlight the difference between workers according to their contributions in the economy. The old payment system under the KMT period was criticized not because that it treated workers unequally, but because that it had little difference between two adjacent levels, and also represented the wrong hierarchy of industrial sectors.Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page29-32 The new wage rank system needed to reverse that, and the new principle of difference was summarized in the phrase of “distribution according to the labor” (). The differences in the aspect of the contribution are further dissected to three levels: the worker performance, the worker's skill and the economic sectors. Correspondingly, the wage ranks and levels dealt with the worker's skill, the differences between sectors and areas dealt with the macro-level economic structure, and finally, the wage form dealt with the worker performance on the workshop floor.  Ranks and Levels  In the preparation of the 1956 wage reform, CCP identified three defects that the old wage system had in the \\"Report on the Wage Regulations (First Draft)\\". Ironically, one defect that the CCP identified in the old wage system of the KMT period is the “egalitarianism” ().Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Jing Ji Dang an Zi Liao Xuan Bian, 1949-1952. Beijing: Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, 1994. Page468 This feature was manifested in that the old wage system had too many levels while the two adjacent levels were too similar. For example, in the North China Electricity Bureau, there were 148 levels. Most employees were in the middle of these levels.Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Jing Ji Dang an Zi Liao Xuan Bian, 1949-1952. Beijing: Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, 1994. Page468-469 The other symptom of the egalitarianism was that the differences between technical and non-technical workers, skilled and unskilled workers, heavy labour and light labour workers were insignificant. Even sometimes unskilled worker's wage was higher than skilled one's.Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Jing Ji Dang an Zi Liao Xuan Bian, 1949-1952. Beijing: Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, 1994. Page468 Citing Stalin, the report believes that such egalitarianism in payment hindered the development of productivity by discouraging workers from learning techniques and becoming skilled workers.Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Jing Ji Dang an Zi Liao Xuan Bian, 1949-1952. Beijing: Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, 1994. Page469 The direction of the new wage system was to cut down the number of the levels and also expand the difference between two levels. In this way, it could encourage workers to improve their knowledge about the production and also the ratio of productivity.李,富春. \\"工资改革的意义及改革的原则.\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20171212225248/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66662/4493091.html The final product of this reform is also called hierarchy wage system based on 8 ranks () because that in the industrial sector, most factories had 8 ranks after the reform. Usually, the difference between the lowest and the highest wage was between 2.5 and 3.2 times.Li, Weiyi. Zhongguo Gong Zi Zhi Du. Beijing Shi: Zhongguo lao dong chu ban she, 1991. Page90 The wage increased geometrically between two ranks. Not all the wage hierarchy systems were based on 8 ranks, especially in the government sections and state-managed factories. 8 ranks usually existed in the local factories. Institutions with higher privilege politically or economically tended to have more ranks. For example, in the government section there were 30 grades, and within each grade, there were 11 levels. In total, there were 330 levels. The difference between the highest wage and the lowest wage is 36.4 times.Zhongguo she hui ke xue yuan, and Zhong yang dang an guan (China). 1998. Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo jing ji dang an zi liao xuan bian, 1953-1957. Beijing: Zhongguo wu jia chu ban she chu ban fa xing. Page488-499 Similar phenomena happened in some production enterprises. For example, in the Changchun First Automobile Works(), there were 48 levels for all works. After the reform, there were 20 ranks and 126 levels.Li, Weiyi. Zhongguo Gong Zi Zhi Du. Beijing Shi: Zhongguo lao dong chu ban she, 1991.Page98 To some degree, the wage reform did not achieve its initial goal in certain kinds of institutions, especially the non-production ones. Ideally speaking, the rank and level of a worker should be determined by his/her skills and experience. In the logic of the policy design, CCP believed that the tangible difference between levels and ranks would encourage employees to work for promotion. If the promotion was based on their skills, they would have greater motivation to “study politics, techniques and culture”.Zhongguo she hui ke xue yuan, and Zhong yang dang an guan (China). 1998. Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo jing ji dang an zi liao xuan bian, 1953-1957. Beijing: Zhongguo wu jia chu ban she chu ban fa xing. Page467 Workers with more knowledge about the production, ideally, would in turn be more efficient in production. Some reports show that in enterprises where the wage rank system was implemented, this system did encourage ordinary workers to study techniques. After the wage rank system was carried out, workers were willing to buy technical books they were not interested in before and also to participate in job training.Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Jing Ji Dang an Zi Liao Xuan Bian, 1949-1952. Beijing: Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, 1994. Page563,567 The method to decide rank and level met some ambiguities in practices. The first was how to decide the ranks and levels of administrative staffs, who do not work in the production process. For them, the criteria of skills were not suitable. Instead, their “job, virtue and talents” () were the determining factors.Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page62 Second, even for the workers, the criteria for promotion were not purely based on their skills and work performance. On the one hand, the CCP did not have enough cadres who were capable of dealing with specific technical details in production; on the other hand, the ideal for workers, and also other employees was “red and expert” (), which means that one must have both political loyalty and expertise in production. Political factors were always in consideration of deciding the wage. In practices, the practice of deciding ranks either was simplified to how long the worker had been employed, or was subjected to the workshop politics. For example, before the Cultural Revolution, new technical workers would automatically advance from the lowest rank to the next rank after working for one year.Walder, Andrew George. 1988. Communist neo- traditionalism: work and authority in Chinese industry. Berkeley: University of California Press. Page203 When political factors were put into this evaluation, the power of grading was in the level of factories, and often the virtues of a worker/employee were deemed as highly related to their political stands. In workshop floor, this political criterion was embedded in kind of personal relationship between leaders and their followers, and the latter affected the levels of wage and other benefits one got to a great extent.Walder, Andrew George. 1988. Communist neo-traditionalism: work and authority in Chinese industry. Berkeley: University of California Press. Page172 Sociologist Andrew Walder termed this kind of relationship as the communist neo-traditionalism. In this situation, the workshop politics played a crucial role in determining the rank, sometimes it was even more important than the technical principles.  Differences between Industries and Areas  The CCP also identified other shortcomings in the old wage system. One was that the hierarchy in wage across the sectors did not reflect the importance of those sectors in the whole economy. In the KMT period, the wage in the light industry was higher than the heavy industry. This was seen by the CCP as reversing the importance of different sectors or misunderstanding it. Taking the 1950 data before the wage reform, which reflects the old wage system, as an example: if the steel industry's average wage is set as 100, the telecom's was 163, the post's was 152, the electricity's was 140, textile's was 135, the chemic industry's was 134, the machine manufacture's was 123, the railway's was 109 and the coal mining's was 99.6.Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Jing Ji Dang an Zi Liao Xuan Bian, 1949-1952. Beijing: Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, 1994. Page566 According to the view of CCP, the right sequence of sectors should be coal mining, steel, petroleum, electricity, machine manufacturing, machine fixing, textile, paper industry, flour industry, tailoring and so on.Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Jing Ji Dang an Zi Liao Xuan Bian, 1949-1952. Beijing: Zhongguo she hui ke xue chu ban she, 1994. Page550 The other problem was the flowing of workers. Under the old wage system, factories in the same sector of one area had different wages. This caused a high rate of turnover of workers across the factories. Before the socialist transformation, the workers tend to move from public enterprise to private one, from rural place to big city. CCP believed that this was an obstacle for production since it made the production process highly unstable and thus it should be eliminated.Zhongguo she hui ke xue yuan, and Zhong yang dang an guan (China). 1998. Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo jing ji dang an zi liao xuan bian, 1953-1957. Beijing: Zhongguo wu jia chu ban she chu ban fa xing. Page560,568,574 The flowing of workers for CCP was also a social problem. Before the wage reform, one factory even called the police to stop their doctor who was unsatisfied of his low wage from quitting the job and leaving the town.Zhongguo she hui ke xue yuan, and Zhong yang dang an guan (China). 1998. Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo jing ji dang an zi liao xuan bian, 1953-1957. Beijing: Zhongguo wu jia chu ban she chu ban fa xing. Page574 Wage reform was supposed to help stop such flowing of the population. In the new wage system designed in 1956, the difference between different sectors is highlighted. Although the new wage rank system did not follow the exact sequence mentioned above, it tried to pay higher wage to workers in the heavy industry. (See form 1) This fitted CCP's developmental strategy: heavy industry was more important than the light industry. {  - ! Industrial Sectors !! Index of average of maximum plus minimum basic wages in North East -  Iron and steel  1.000 -  coal  1.000 -  electric power  .974 -  machine manufacturing  .946 -  petroleum  .950 -  heavy chemical  .911 -  lumber  .911 -  cement  .914 -  grass  .914 -  textile  .804 -  flour milling  .721 -  tobacco  .689 }Schran, Peter. 1974. “Institutional Continuity and Motivational Change: the Chinese Industrial Wages System, 1950-1973.” Asian Survey 14(11):1014–32. Page1017 Unifying the wage in the same industry in the same area would help stop the moving of workers. It made the production more stable, gave the state more suitable situation to control the workforce. Also, since the workers had fewer choices, the state supposed that itself could pay less wage in total. Also, in order to pay a minimum amount of wage but motivated people to the greatest extent, the new wage system differentiated payment in different geographical areas according to the living cost. The whole country in the 1956 wage reform was divided into 6 to 11 wage areas (), and each area might further be divided into big cities and small cities.Li, Weiyi. Zhongguo Gong Zi Zhi Du. Beijing Shi: Zhongguo lao dong chu ban she, 1991. Generally speaking, the more developed area had a higher level of wage than the less-developed one, the big cities had a higher wage than the small cities. The wage was supposed to represent the differences in the living standard like the old wage point system. In doing this, it could pay the minimum amount to ensure employees’ everyday life. Finally, the new system provided the material incentive for workers who moved from more developed areas to less-developed. These workers were assigned to build industrial projects in inner provinces.Zhongguo she hui ke xue yuan, and Zhong yang dang an guan (China). 1998. Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo jing ji dang an zi liao xuan bian, 1953-1957. Beijing: Zhongguo wu jia chu ban she chu ban fa xing. Page412,465 The CCP tried to introduce more industry in the inner area to develop the country, and technical workers and skilled workers were needed in these projects. The only way to get them there was to assign these workers from their former working places, usually located in more developed areas and big cities, to the inner areas, which was less- developed. In order to encourage them to follow the order, their wage would be higher than the local standard, so they were supposed to have higher real wages.  Piecework Wage  In the 1956 wage reform, piecework wage was deemed as the most suitable form of wage. According to the resolution of this reform, the piece-work wage should be expanded to any factories where it was possible.“国务院关于工资改革的决定.” 1956 https://web.archive.org/save/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66662/4493081.html Thus, unlike some assertion that China did not have piecework wage,Miin-ling Yu, 2010, “Labor Is Glorious: Model Laborer in the PRC”, editor(s): Thomas Bernstein and Hua-Yu Li, China Learns from the Soviet Union, 1949-present, pp. 231-258, Lanham, MD: Rowman and LittleField Publishing Group. it was once a focus of the CCP policy, and in 1956, the percentage of piecework wage reached around 46%.Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page78 As the whole wage system bore a lot of features from the Soviet Union, the piecework wage system was also introduced via learning the Soviet Union experience. The piecework wage did exist in China before. However, the idea that piecework wage should be implemented in the state-owned factories, combined with wage rank and should be expanded to the whole industry was a Soviet idea. Despite the advice on wage reform from the Soviet experts during the early 1950s, many factories in Northeast implemented piecework wage under the direct management of Soviet experts, even if some workers originally did not welcome this system.林, 盼 and 妍 朱. 2015. “工人分化与激励异化.” 史林. Page161 Mao might have little idea about the economic policy in the beginning, thus the Soviet experience played a much more important role in the early PRC.杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37. Page134 After the 1956 wage reform, the piecework rate was not on absolute piece as it was during the KMT area, instead, the piece rate was linked to the wage rank. According to the 1951 “The Northeast State-Owned Factories’ Piecework Wage System Provisional Regulation (Draft)\\" (), the formula of piece work wage in China was: \\\\text{Wage per Product} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Standard Wage of Worker’s Rank}}{\\\\text{25.5day}*\\\\text{Working Hours per Day}*\\\\text{Work Norm per Hour}} \\\\ “中共中央转发东北局关于《东北公营企业计件工资制度暂行规程（草案）》.” https://web.archive.org/save/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66656/4492726.html The work norm in the formula was set higher than the average output and lower than the output of advanced workers, so that it could encourage workers to work harder to reach the level of advanced workers. Only products that passed the qualification would be counted. Otherwise, if worker caused loss, he could not receive any pay for the defected product and needed to compensate for it.“中共中央转发东北局关于《东北公营企业计件工资制度暂行规程（草案）》.” https://web.archive.org/save/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66656/4492726.html There were some differences between the Soviet model and the practices of piecework wage in China. First, the piecework wage in PRC was initially an unlimited piece system.林, 盼 and 妍 朱. 2015. “经济政策的政治理念: 二十世纪五十年代计件工资制的存废.” 中共党史研究 (5). Page48 This was due to the relative lack of skilled cadres in the early 1950s, and also reflects that CCP realized from the beginning that differences between the China and Soviet Union did not allow it to copy Soviet model without any modification. Another difference between the Soviet Union model and piecework system in China is the unit of the piece-work wage. In China, sometimes the unit was not individual as in the Soviet Union, but working group.“中共中央转发东北局关于《东北公营企业计件工资制度暂行规程（草案）》.” https://web.archive.org/save/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66656/4492726.html Peter Schran also points out that another difference between Soviet Model and Chinese practices is that in China, piecework was more prevailing among the unskilled workers and in the handicraft, while in Soviet Union, piecework was more common among skilled workers and in the mechanized industries.Schran, Peter. 1964. “Unity and Diversity of Russian and Chinese Industrial Wage Policies.” The Journal of Asian Studies 23(2):245. Page250 Piecework wage was a highly controversial issue in the early PRC. Despite the ideological debate mentioned in the later section, it also met practical difficulties. In the beginning of implementing this system, the shortage of raw materials and lack of skilled cadres who could be in charge of the production process led to many conflicts during the production and confusion about it.Walder, Andrew George. 1988. Communist neo-traditionalism: work and authority in Chinese industry. Berkeley: University of California Press. Chapter 5 Still, CCP wanted to increase the range of piecework wage as quickly as possible before 1958. More information on this topic will be provided in the following sections.  Debates around the Wage Rank System What was special for the Chinese wage system in Mao area was that tension between the political aspect and economical aspect was highlighted in the debates about it. From Mao's perspective, the wage system as a whole was not suitable for the socialist period. As early as 1958, in the Beidaihe Conference, Mao mentioned that he preferred the provisioning system. He argued that compared to the provisioning system, the wage system was a step backward. He said :“[We] should consider the question of eliminating the wage system [and] restoring the supply system…Restoring the supply system seems like ‘retrogression,’ [but] ‘retrogression’ means progress, because we've retrogressed since we came into the cities.”Zedong, Mao. n.d. Talks at the Beidaihe Conference (Draft Transcript). 1st ed. edited by R. MACFARQUHAR, T. CHEEK, and E. WU. Harvard University Asia Center. In Mao’s opinion, the wage system would finally be eliminated in the future, if not immediately. For Mao, the wage rank system was a retrogression in two aspects: it emphasized too much on the material incentives and ignored the political work; it created a new form of inequality among workers and cadres.  Material Incentives  The first problem of the wage rank system was that in its policy logic, the material incentives were given more significance than the political incentives. It assumed that the social consciousness of workers, due to the low level of politics, were not able to go beyond the money economy. Opposite to this view, Mao believed that the politics can boost the productivity. Thus, CCP should change its policy from “cash banner” to “political banner”. Cancelling of piecework and stopping of regrading revealed this aspect of the debate. = Debate around Piecework = Piecework wage is a highly controversial issue in Socialist theory. From Marx's own point of view, the piecework rate is a tool for deception. When Marx talks about different forms of wage in Capital Volume One, he asserts that the piecework wage best suits the capitalist mode of production, because that it makes the workers believe it is not the labor power they sell to the capitalists, but the products.Marx, Karl Heinrich. 1954. Capital: a critique of political economy. Volume 1 Volume 1. When the Soviet Union took this form of wage, it was questioned by the French syndicalists who visited Moscow. Stalin’s reply focused on the role of piecework in promoting the productivity by mentioning the Stakhanovite. He said: “without progressives and without pieceworkers there would not be Stakhanovites and shock workers.” “Notes from the Meeting between Comrade Stalin and Economists Concerning Questions in Political Economy, 29 January 1941,” January 29, 1941, History and Public Policy Program Digital Archive, ARAN fond 1705, opis 1, delo 166, listy 14-26. Translated by Ethan Pollock, first published in CWIHP Working Paper 33 http://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/110984 This argument about material incentives was rejected by Mao, manifesting the divergence between the Soviet model and the Chinese Socialist Road. In the beginning, CCP tried to extend the piecework wage following the Soviet Model. In 1956, spreading the piece-work wage was on the main agenda of the wage reform. In 1956, the percentage of piecework wage in state-owned enterprise reached its peak of 45.41%. Like other state-led movements, the quick expansion of piecework wage caused a lot of practical problems in workshop floor. In 1957, the CCP readjusted the pace of promoting piece-work wage, and the percentage of piece- work dropped to 39.29%.Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page78 The determinant moment came one year later. After Mao launched Great Leap Forward in 1957, some factories that recently implemented the piecework wage canceled the piecework and returned to the time-rate system. Other factories followed this trend for more obvious political reasons.高, 华. 2000. “鞍钢宪法的历史真实与‘政治正确性’.” 二十一世纪双月刊 (58):62–69. In the 1958 Beidaihe Conference, Mao singled out piecework wage when he attacked the wage rank system and expressed clearly that “piece-rate wages are not a good system.” Zedong, Mao. n.d. Talks at the Beidaihe Conference (Draft Transcript). 1st ed. edited by R. MACFARQUHAR, T. CHEEK, and E. WU. Harvard University Asia Center. Page437 This speech, and the later propaganda in People’s Daily and other party's media set the tone on this issue. The most common critics on the piecework wage were that it did not pay attention to the political incentives. Only after two years when CCP claimed that piecework wage should be expanded to where it was possible, the Party decided to cancel the piecework wage national wide and issued a documentation called “Situations and Advises about Cancelling the Piecework Wage” (). The percentage of piecework rate further dropped to less than 5% in 1960.Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page87 Although later CCP decided again to implement piecework wage in some factories, the percentage of piecework wage never went back to what it had been before the 1956. The highest percentage of piecework rate before the Cultural Revolution was 19.9%.Li, Weiyi. Zhongguo Gong Zi Zhi Du. Beijing Shi: Zhongguo lao dong chu ban she, 1991.Page.234 During the early period of Cultural Revolution, piecework wage almost disappeared in China. Despite the ideological debates on the high level politics, some scholars argue that the workshop practices were more influential in the failure of piecework wage system. In the early days of expanding piecework wage, many factories faced practical difficulties like lack of raw material supplies or cadres who were capable of mastering the technical issues in counting the work.林, 盼 and 妍 朱. 2015. “工人分化与激励异化.” 史林. Even if these technical issues had been solved, piecework wage still had its local political problem. Using oral history evidence, Walder argues that the piecework wage system was never popular on the workshop floor when it encountered workshop floor politics. In the practices, the new party members with technical training were often in charge of it, while the older party members, who had higher grade and more political capital were often reluctant to obey them. Also, because the party members were in charge of deciding the work norm and counting the pieces, the piecework wage system put the local party organization in antagonism with the normal workers.Walder, Andrew George. 1988. Communist neo-traditionalism: work and authority in Chinese industry. Berkeley: University of California Press. Chapter 5 Other scholars also prove this point via using more official documentation.林, 盼 and 妍 朱. 2015. “工人分化与激励异化.” 史林. = The Suspension of Promotion = Since the Great Leap Forward, the grading or rising rank was also stopped in a lot of places. This practice was first implemented on the new workers. Walder noted that the group of people who were affected most by wage austerity were those who enter the labor force after 1958,Walder, Andrew George. 1988. Communist neo-traditionalism: work and authority in Chinese industry. Berkeley: University of California Press. Page201-202 i.e., after the Great Leap Forward. Another example also shows that the new workers who joined the worker forces only had a transitive wage, which was lower than the wage rank system.李, 震亚. 1958. \\"计件工资制已经过时了.\\" 劳动(19). Although in 1961, “The State-Run Industrial Enterprises Working Regulations (Draft)” stipulates that such regrading should be carried out every year, and each year 40% of the employees could be raised to the higher rank, such practices were seldom carried out. This stopping of regrading was partly caused by the economic difficulties the Great Leap Forward brought about. In the first year of the Great Leap Forward, the state-owned factories recruited a large number of new employees,\\"中共中央转批国家计划委员会党组、劳动部党组《关于1958年劳动工资的基本情况和1959年劳动工资的安排意见的报告》.\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20171213004239/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66666/4493331.html probably in order to finish the work norm. In the late 1959, Zhou En lai in the “Opinions About Labor Wage and Welfare” emphasized again that the state needed to cut down the number of the workers and also the necessities of low wage system.周, 恩来. \\"关于劳动工资和劳动福利政策的意见.\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20171212225030/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66664/4493153.html All these factors led to the stopping of income increasing. According to the data collected by Andrew Walder and others, because of the increasing of the good price, till 1982, the real wage after 1956 never reached its highest point in 1956.Walder, Andrew George. 1988.

Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page117,142  Creating a New Form of Inequality  The other issue that Mao identified with the new wage rank system was that this new wage rank system created a new kind of inequality. He was especially unhappy about some party members, especially among the high-level party cadres. In one meeting with Shandong provincial officers in 1957, he criticized that a lot of such cadres now were fighting for personal fame and interests. They would even cry if they were classified to a low rank.杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37. Page136 Later in the 1958 Beidaihe Conference, Mao argued that the wage rank system is a part of the “bourgeois right” (资产阶级法权). He said: “[We] must eradicate the ideology of bourgeois right. For instance, competing for position, competing for rank, demanding overtime pay, high salaries for mental workers and low salaries for physical laborers-these are all vestiges of bourgeois ideology.” Zedong, Mao. n.d. Talks at the Beidaihe Conference (Draft Transcript). 1st ed. edited by R. MACFARQUHAR, T. CHEEK, and E. WU. Harvard University Asia Center. Page406 This point is closely related to his critics on the Soviet Union, he thinks that “wage grades among Soviet cadres are too numerous and the gap [between the cadres and] the workers and peasants is too wide.” Zedong, Mao. n.d. Talks at the Beidaihe Conference (Draft Transcript). 1st ed. edited by R. MACFARQUHAR, T. CHEEK, and E. WU. Harvard University Asia Center. Page425 This was seen as a feature of phony communism.Ren min ri bao bian ji bu, and \\"Hong qi\\" bian ji bu. 1964. Guan yu Heluxiaofu de jia gong chan zhu yi ji qi zai shi jie li shi shang de jiao xun: jiu ping Su gong zhong yang de gong kai xin. Beijing: Ren min chu ban she. In the Soviet Union rank system, the huge wage gap was absolutely true; the wage difference was larger than most Western countries' Civil Servant wage system. The most ironic thing was, compared to KMT period, the inequality in the 1956 wage rank system in the government (36.4:1) could be even larger than the old wage rank system (14.5:1).杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37. Page132 = Wage Cuts = Due to this rejection, although Mao did not reject to accept any wage at all, he refused to receive the highest rank of wage. Instead, Mao only accepted to take 404.8 Yuan per month. This got the attention of Zhou En Lai and others cadres. Only one year after the 1956 wage reform, the wage of high-level cadres was cut in 1957.杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37.Li, Weiyi. Zhongguo Gong Zi Zhi Du. Beijing Shi: Zhongguo lao dong chu ban she, 1991. Page47 In 1959, the top three levels in the government wage rank system merged to a single rank. In 1960, the wage of high-level cadres was further cut.Zhuang, Qidong, Lunqu Yuan, and Jianli Li. Xin Zhongguo Gong Zi Shi Gao. Peking: Zhongguo cai zheng jing ji chu ban she, 1986. Page108 Even after cutting the wage during this period, the difference between the highest and lowest is still 20.24:1.杨, 奎松. 2007. “从供给制到职务等级工资制.” 历史研究 (4):111–37. More importantly, cutting the wage could not solve the fundamental problem of “bourgeois right”, since the difference between the ruling and the ruled still persisted during these practices.Wu, Yiching. 2005. “Rethinking ‘Capitalist Restoration’ in China.” Monthly Review 57(6):44–63. == Wage of Contracted/Temporary Employees == The wage for the contracted/temporary employee is still an unstudied topic. Current materials only show that their wage should be less than the formal workers, while higher than the income of farmers.Li, Weiyi. Zhongguo Gong Zi Zhi Du. Beijing Shi: Zhongguo lao dong chu ban she, 1991. Page46,122\\"中共中央关于发展地方工业问题的意见.\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20171213010141/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64184/64186/66665/4493264.html This difference between formal workers and other employees might have contributed to keeping a relative high level of work performance in the state- owned factories.Li, Huaiyin. 2016. “Worker Performance in State-Owned Factories in Maoist China.” Modern China 42(4):377–414. More oral history and studies based on local archives are needed to complement this part. == Later Developments == Although after 1956 wage reform, there were many modifications on the wage system, only the details of this system have been changed. The general principle of the whole system remains unchanged, especially the rank system. 2 years before Mao Ze Dong died, he lamented when he met the Denmark Prime Minister Poul Hartling : “In a word, China belongs to Socialist Countries. Before the Liberation it is similar to Capitalism. Now it still implements hierarchy wage system based on 8 ranks, distribution according to labour, and exchange through money, all these are not different from the old society. The difference lies in the ownership.”毛, 泽东. \\"关于理论问题的谈话要点.\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20171213010347/http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_73767cad0100wwmb.html This had not been changed during Mao's time, and also after he died. == Further reading == Economic history of China (1949–present) Great Leap Forward Wage reform in the Soviet Union, 1956–1962 == Footnotes == Category:People's Republic of China Category:Chinese economic policy Category:Economic reforms Category:Economic history Category:1940s economic history Category:1950s economic history Category:1960s economic history ","title":"Wage reform in China, 1949–1976"},{"id":"56037044","text":"Ogbonnia \\"Obo\\" Okoronkwo (born April 24, 1995) is an American football outside linebacker for the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL).

Data structures used to solve the problem include balanced binary search trees, van Emde Boas trees, and fusion trees. In the static predecessor problem, the set of elements does not change, but in the dynamic predecessor problem, insertions into and deletions from the set are allowed. The predecessor problem is a simple case of the nearest neighbor problem, and data structures that solve it have applications in problems like integer sorting. == Definition == The problem consists of maintaining a set , which contains a subset of integers. Each of these integers can be stored with a word size of , implying that U \\\\le 2^w. Data structures that solve the problem support these operations: * \`predecessor(x)\`, which returns the largest element in less than or equal to * \`successor(x)\`, which returns the smallest element in greater than or equal to In addition, data structures which solve the dynamic version of the problem also support these operations: * \`insert(x)\`, which adds to the set * \`delete(x)\`, which removes from the set The problem is typically analyzed in a transdichotomous model of computation such as word RAM. == Data structures == An x-fast trie containing the integers 1 (0012), 4 (1002) and 5 (1012), which can be used to efficiently solve the predecessor problem. One simple solution to this problem is to use a balanced binary search tree, which achieves (in Big O notation) a running time of O(\\\\log n) for predecessor queries. The Van Emde Boas tree achieves a query time of O(\\\\log \\\\log U), but requires O(U) space. Dan Willard proposed an improvement on this space usage with the x-fast trie, which requires O(n \\\\log U) space and the same query time, and the more complicated y-fast trie, which only requires O(n) space. Fusion trees, introduced by Michael Fredman and Willard, achieve O(\\\\log_w n) query time and O(n) for predecessor queries for the static problem. The dynamic problem has been solved using exponential trees with O(\\\\log_w n + \\\\log \\\\log n) query time,. and with expected time O(\\\\log_w n) using hashing.. == Mathematical properties == There have been a number of attempts to prove lower bounds on the predecessor problem, or find what the running time of asymptotically optimal solutions would be.

The first part aired on 5 December 2017, and the second on 7 December 2017 on BBC One in the United Kingdom. Both parts were written by Andy Bayliss and directed by Paulette Randall. The plot sees the arrival of Professor John Gaskell (Paul McGann) at Holby City Hospital, shortly before Fredrik Johanssen (Billy Postlethwaite) goes on a shooting spree, which results in the death of Raf di Lucca (Joe McFadden). Holby City executive producer Simon Harper first teased the two-part storyline in November 2017, saying the characters would face the \\"hospital's greatest peril yet\\" and their lives would be changed forever. Details of the plot were withheld, but it was confirmed that McGann would make his debut during the first part. The actor said \\"Group Animal\\" was a departure from the show's regular plots. McFadden's departure was also kept a secret by producers, so it would have \\"maximum impact\\" on viewers. McFadden filmed his final scenes two months prior to them being broadcast. The episodes were promoted with a trailer titled \\"When Darkness Falls Look to the Light\\". \\"Group Animal – Part One\\" was seen by 4.92 million viewers and \\"Group Animal – Part Two\\" was watched by 5.19 million. The episodes received mostly positive attention from critics, with one calling the plot \\"nail-biting, edge-of-seat stuff\\". Some viewers hoped that Holby City would win awards for the episodes. However, the Motor Neurone Disease Association criticised the show for misleading viewers about a cure for motor neuron disease. The episodes won Best Drama Storyline at the 2018 Inside Soap Awards. ==Plot== Part one The staff of Holby City Hospital prepare for the arrival of renowned surgeon Professor John Gaskell (Paul McGann), who has used stem cell treatment to reverse Motor Neuron Disease (MND) in a patient. Gaskell brings in a patient with a spindle cell lipoma and he asks Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) to join him in surgery. Feeling under pressure to prove herself, Jac removes Oliver Valentine (James Anderson) from his scheduled operation so she can perform it herself, using the opportunity as practice. On AAU, Essie Harrison (Kaye Wragg) expresses her fears to her husband Raf di Lucca (Joe McFadden) that something bad is going to happen when she notices that she has lost her wedding ring. Raf treats a pregnant woman who fell into a lake and discovers that superfetation has occurred during her pregnancy. He safely delivers her triplets and saves her life. Nurse Donna Jackson (Jaye Jacobs) shows Raf some threatening text messages from Jeremy Warren (Nick Rhys), who blames the hospital for his mother's death. Halfway through the surgery with Gaskell, Jac leaves the theatre as her nerves get the better of her. John encourages her to return and finish the surgery. Afterwards, Jac breaks down in Adrian Fletcher's (Alex Walkinshaw) arms, as her grief over her sister's death and other recent events catch up with her. In the wet lab, Gaskell introduces his MND patient, László Furz, to Essie, Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) and Sacha Levy (Bob Barrett). Jac apologises to Ollie and tells Raf that she has decided to leave Holby for good. She gives him her resignation letter to hand to Hanssen, but as she makes her way down the stairs, she is greeted by an anonymous figure, who shoots her and leaves her to die. Part two The power goes off on AAU, plunging the ward into darkness. Raf takes his patient to ITU and another gunshot rings out as the gunman proceeds through the hospital. After being informed of the shooting, Hanssen instigates the major incident procedure and the hospital is sent into lockdown. Sacha finds Jac and brings her into the wet lab, where he, Gaskell, Hanssen and Essie try to save her life. Paramedic Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson) is handed Raf's patient, who is found with a gunshot wound to her leg, and he treats her in an ambulance outside. The gunman reaches AAU and Donna protects a young boy, as he walks through the ward. She calls Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) when a patient suffers a haemorrhage, and he manages to smuggle himself into the hospital to help. Donna tells him that she saw the gunman's face, while Hanssen is also informed of his identity. Sergeant Taylor (Victor Gardener) receives an image of the gunman and is informed that he is specifically targeting hospital staff. The gunman goes to Darwin, where Ollie, Morven Digby (Eleanor Fanyinka) and Roxanna MacMillan (Hermione Gulliford) are operating on Roxanna's husband David (Fraser James). The gunman shoots Ollie in the head and Roxanna operates to save him. David suffers a cerebral haemorrhage and dies. The gunman is revealed to be Hanssen's son Fredrik Johanssen (Billy Postlethwaite). He makes it onto Keller ward, where he intends to shoot Dominic Copeland (David Ames), but Hanssen interrupts and tries to talk with his son. Fredrik tells Hanssen that he knows he is not part of the family Hanssen has created at the hospital. Hanssen urges Fredrik to put down the gun, but armed police shoot Fredrik and he dies. Essie recognises Raf's patient and Fletch explains that she actually has a shrapnel wound. Essie listens to a voicemail message from Raf, who explains that he has been shot in the jugular and knows he will not make it. Sacha finds Raf's body in the lift, and races to comfort Essie along with Fletch. Ollie and Jac are taken to the ITU, and Sacha gives a statement to the press. ==Production== Paul McGann made his debut as John Gaskell in the first part of \\"Group Animal\\". On 21 November 2017, it was announced that Holby City would be airing a two-part episode the following month, that would result in the hospital being \\"changed forever\\". Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy confirmed that Paul McGann's character Professor John Gaskell would be introduced, while series regulars Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel), Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) and Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) would feature prominently. The show's executive producer, Simon Harper, stated \\"You'll see our NHS heroes instinctively rush towards the hospital's greatest peril yet in a story that changes lives forever – and the fact that the episodes introduce Paul, one of our country's most internationally renowned screen talents, is the icing on the cake.\\" Harper praised the cast and crew for their work on the episodes, which he branded \\"stunningly dramatic and moving\\". Both episodes were written by Andy Bayliss, directed by Paulette Randall and produced by Sarah Creasey. Details of the storyline were kept secret and did not immediately reveal what peril the hospital and its staff would face. McGann's casting was announced in April 2017, and Dainty (Digital Spy) reported that his character would be \\"the saviour of the hour\\" when he made his debut in December amid a crisis at the hospital. McGann filmed his first scenes during August. His character, Professor Gaskell, is introduced as the pioneer of a new stem cell treatment for Motor Neuron Disease in the first episode. During an interview with Allison Jones of Inside Soap, McGann pointed out that \\"Group Animal\\" was a departure from the show's regular plots, and it was something the producers had thought long and hard about beforehand. He found the episodes \\"thrilling\\" to film, and said his character has to prove himself immediately. The episodes also feature an appearance from Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson), a paramedic from Holby City's sister show Casualty. During the first half of \\"Group Animal\\", Jac Naylor is seen dealing with her grief at her sister's death and deciding to leave the hospital. However, at the end of the episode, the power goes out and Jac is shot by an unseen assailant, who leaves her to die in a corridor. The cliffhanger led viewers to voice their concern that Marcel was leaving the show, and she later thanked them for their support of her character. At the start of the second episode, Jac is found bleeding from a gunshot wound and Gaskell is forced to perform surgery on her. Shortly after, it is revealed that Hanssen's son Fredrik Johanssen (Billy Postlethwaite) is going on a rampage through the hospital with a rifle. Fredrik shoots Oliver Valentine (James Anderson) in the head, before he is confronted by Hanssen. Fredrik is killed off after explaining that he feels resentment towards his father. The second episode concluded with the revelation that Raf di Lucca (Joe McFadden) had also been shot and killed. The character's exit was kept out of spoiler articles by producers for \\"maximum impact\\". McFadden found Raf's exit to be \\"quite unexpected\\" and dramatic. He was pleased that the producers trusted him with the story and thought it would also begin new storylines for the other characters, as they react to Raf's death. He also said, \\"It is a shocking episode but it's a drama; there's supposed to be drama and conflict. It is probably one of the darkest episodes that I've read but I like that they're pushing boundaries and challenging people and I think it's been done really well.\\" McFadden chose to leave the show after four years, as he believed he had done everything he could with the character. McFadden was appearing on Strictly Come Dancing at the time the episodes aired and he admitted that he found it hard to keep his departure a secret while he was on the show, as he had shot his final scenes two months before they aired. He called his last day on set \\"a surreal experience\\". McFadden explained that he had been excited to work with McGann, but in their only scene together he had to lie on the floor and pretend to be dead. ==Promotion and broadcast== \\"Group Animal\\" was first teased in a September 2017 trailer called \\"The Reel Before The Storm\\", which showcased the upcoming Autumn storylines. The episodes were later publicised by a trailer titled \\"When Darkness Falls Look to the Light\\", which was released on 21 November 2017. BBC Creative conceived and created the trailer, which was intended to give the show \\"a shot of adrenaline\\". A radio campaign and promotional photos were also released. The trailer shows Jac running from \\"an unknown threat\\" through a hospital corridor and hiding with Ric and Sacha, while Hanssen cowers from the threat alone. John Gaskell then throws open some doors, which brings light into the corridor, and gestures for them to follow him. Duncan Lindsay of the Metro thought that this showed John would be Holby's saviour during the event. Lindsay also branded the trailer \\"spooky\\", while Huw Fullerton of Radio Times dubbed it \\"exciting\\". Viewers noticed various references and comparisons to Doctor Who, in which McGann starred. Fullerton joked, \\"Five quid says he whips out the sonic screwdriver during surgery...\\" \\"Group Animal – Part One\\" was broadcast on BBC One on 5 December 2017, with \\"Part Two\\" airing two days later on 7 December. ==Reception== In its original broadcast, \\"Group Animal – Part One\\" was watched by an audience of 4.92 million. \\"Group Animal – Part Two\\" saw a small increase in viewership, with 5.19 million tuning in. This was the highest rated episode of Holby City since \\"The Price We Pay\\", which aired on 28 February 2017 and attracted 5.34 million viewers. (User must select \\"BBC1\\" in the Channel field and then select the appropriate year, month and week to retrieve the figure for each episode) A reporter for Western Mail chose the first part as one of their \\"Picks of the Week\\". They thought McGann's Professor Gaskell had an \\"irrepressible charm\\", and wondered how he would fit in as \\"the team is pushed to its limits\\". Rianne Houghton of Digital Spy found the first episode to be \\"a slow-burner\\", yet it \\"wasn't short on the drama\\". What's on TV's David Hollingsworth included the episodes in his \\"Pick of the Best Shows\\" feature. He gave them four out of five stars, and called it \\"a dramatic week for Holby fans\\". He added, \\"But as medical history is made, lives saved and new beginnings created, there's also a terrible darkness about to engulf the hospital...\\" Jack Wetherill of the Daily Star branded the second episode \\"nail-biting, edge-of-seat stuff\\". Sara Wallis from the Daily Mirror observed that the episodes were full of action and thought the sound of gun shots and the hospital lockdown were some of the \\"most dramatic scenes\\". She concluded, \\"It's the greatest threat the hospital has ever experienced, and of course, someone will be left fighting for their life. No spoilers, but expect lots of running, shouting and the usual spattering of blood as our Holby heroes try to save the day.\\" David Brown of the Radio Times thought there was far too much build-up to the shooting. He thought Gaskell was \\"thrown in at the deep end\\" during his first day when he had to operate on Jac. Writing for BT Group, Alex Fletcher, called \\"Group Animal – Part Two\\" a \\"powerful and emotional episode\\", and added that Raf departed in \\"heartbreaking fashion.\\" Some viewers thought the premise of the second part was similar to a 2010 episode of American medical drama Grey's Anatomy, in which a gunman shoots several hospital staff members, while others expressed their hope that Holby City would win awards for the episodes. The Motor Neurone Disease Association criticised the show for misleading viewers about a cure for motor neuron disease. The charity was contacted by several people who were upset about the storyline, and they requested a response from the BBC. The \\"Group Animal\\" storyline contributed to Holby City's nomination in the Soap and Continuing Drama category at the Royal Television Society Awards in March 2018. The episodes won the Best Drama Storyline category at the 2018 Inside Soap Awards, under the title \\"The hospital shooting\\". ==References * \\"Group Animal – Part One\\" on BBC Online * \\"Group Animal – Part Two\\" on BBC Online * * Category:2017 British television episodes Category:Holby City episodes ","title":"Group Animal"},{"id":"56037324","text":"Little Mill Mountain is a mountain located in Adirondack Mountains of New York located in the Town of Indian Lake north of Indian Lake. ==References== Category:Mountains of Hamilton County, New York Category:Mountains of New York (state) ","title":"Little Mill Mountain"},{"id":"56037328","text":"Alexander McKenzie was an Australian rules footballer for .

The Act transferred almost all Civil List revenues (mainly customs and excise) to Parliament. In the last year of George II's reign these had been worth £876,988. In return, the new King received a fixed, annual Civil List of £800,000.E. A. Reitan, 'The Civil List in Eighteenth-Century British Politics: Parliamentary Supremacy versus the Independence of the Crown', The Historical Journal Vol. 9, No. 3 (1966), p. 323. Under George II the economy had grown and consequently the revenues increased. The fixed amount George III received was therefore a reduction in the Civil List.Reitan, p. 323. If the previous arrangement had been retained, George III's Civil List in 1777 would have been more than £1,000,000 and would have amounted to £1,812,308 in 1798.Reitan, p. 323. The £800,000 stipulated in the Act was soon found to be inadequate and a Civil List crisis was only averted in the early 1760s because George II had built up savings worth £172,000 that George III was able to draw on.Reitan, p. 324. By the end of the decade the Civil List arrears amounted to more than half a million pounds and the King had to apply to Parliament to pay it off.Reitan, pp. 324-5. ==Notes== Category:Great Britain Acts of Parliament 1760 ","title":"Civil List Act 1760"},{"id":"56037511","text":"An exit grant is a grant made (typically by a private foundation or other large donor to a nonprofit) with the clear expectation that the donor will not make any further similar grants to the donee. == Reasons for exit grant == Typical reasons for exit grants include: * The donor is winding down its activities, for instance, by exhausting its fund. Examples include Atlantic Philanthropies and the Beldon Fund. * The donor is stopping or reducing spending on the specific program or initiative within which the grant is made. An example is the winding down of the Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative by the Hewlett Foundation. It could also be that the donor is reducing resources for grants and evaluation in the program, even if the program is not being completely shut down. * Recent evidence (or lack of evidence) has led the donor to decide against the value of ongoing support to the grantee. The generally offered reason for making exit grants rather than abruptly stopping support is that they give grantees sufficient time to find alternative sources or make other plans to deal with the financial and reputational costs of losing a major funding source.

An ethnic Bosniak, Reko was born in the hamlet of Gudelj of the village Jošanica in Foča in eastern Bosnia. During World War II his grandmother was saved by a Serb. He finished primary school in the village of Ustikolina, after which he moved to Sarajevo on higher studies, finishing middle technical school in 1982. He finished the Army military school in 1986 as an infantry. He served as an officer (časnik) in Novo Mesto (in Slovenia), Gospić (Croatia), Pljevlja (Montenegro), Bitola (Macedonia), Zaječar (Serbia). Reko deserted from the JNA in April 1992. While wanting to preserve \\"Brotherhood and Unity\\", the real situation, when the war spilled over into Bosnia and his home village, forced him to leave the JNA. He had received information that Serb forces occupied Foča and his village. He contacted his ethnic Serb friend and JNA colleague Dragan Simić stationed in Niš, and told him that he was to leave to be with his family. Simić offered to help, and the two went for Bosnia. They crossed Serb-held territory into Bosniak-held territory in Goražde where Reko believed his family took refuge. His colleague saved him from Bosnian Serb policemen at Ustiprača. Reko became the first commander of the 43rd Drina Assault Brigade () of ARBiH, based in Goražde. His high rank came as the result of his Military Academy diploma. His nom de guerre became Makedonac due to his years of service in Bitola. He was unable to meet up with his family in Gudelj, as that village was under Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) control. Serb soldiers killed his mother Aziza and grandfather (along with five other family members) while cleansing the village of the remaining people, through setting a house which held them on fire. Reko has stated that he knows of the perpetrators, and that one lives in Canada. A few days after, the Municipal headquarters of the Territorial Defense ordered that the Serb village of Bučje be cleansed as it posed a threat due to VRS progress. While an ideal chance for revenge, Reko refused, and was called weak and a traitor. He organized talks with the Bučje inhabitants for the peaceful surrender of them and their weapons. As a result, the village's 45 Serbs and few Bosniaks were saved. Reko learnt that he was an assassination target due to saving Serbs, and that orders came from people currently in the Bosnian government. After the war he set up a memorial to the killed members of his family. After the war, he moved to Denmark. He became a successful businessman, and established a family, with two children. He and his wife eventually divorced. In 2008, he met with his childhood romance Azra in Bosnia, who was a widow with two children. They eventually married. He owns a Danish-Bosnian company \\"Bohen\\" that produces gaskets, parts of rubber and plastic and parts for water and heating. He currently lives in Denmark with his family. Reko established the political movement \\"Most 21\\", aimed at a multi-ethnic unitary state. A documentary on his life was made in 2016, called Makedonac. There is plans of a movie. He has been interviewed by various newspapers and guested TV shows such as RTRS's Telering, Prva's Život Priča, Face's Face to Face, Happy TV's Jutarnji program, Elta's Razgovor, OSMTV's Lice Nacije. ==ReferencesSources== * * * ==External links== * Category:Bosnian businesspeople Category:Danish businesspeople Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina emigrants to Denmark Category:People from Foča Category:Bosniaks of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina soldiers Category:Officers of the Yugoslav People's Army Category:1963 births Category:Living people ","title":"Amir Reko"},{"id":"56037669","text":"Andrew Jackson White III (born June 16, 1993) is an American basketball player for the Westchester Knicks of the NBA G League.

It is associated with the name because the sage in his final incarnation was transformed into a crow by sage Lomas, and finally, he decided to spend his life in the form of a crow. As per the Hindu texts, it has been said Kak Bhusundi was the great devotee of Lord Rama and was the first person to narrate the Ramayana, much before Valmiki and Tulsidas. He has also been famous for his many other qualities, i.e. he is one of the Chiranjivis, an immortal living being in Hinduism who are to remain alive on Earth until the end of the current Kali Yuga. ==Birth== As per the Hindu texts, it has been said that Kakbhushundi has taken many births. Originally, he was a sudra of Ayodhya. Then, after going through many rebirths, he was finally born as a Brahmana. From this birth only, he started getting into the devotion of Rama. In this birth, once due to his opposite arguments with one of sages named Lomas, he was transformed for a time into a crow. ==Life== As per the texts, it has been said that Kakbhushundi has been gifted with the living of thousand lives and the ability to choose the physical form as per his wish. For his great devotion, Lord Rama has blessed him with eternal life and limitless vision. Once, the sage Lomas, in his anger, had cursed him to become a crow because of his repeated arguments and ignorance to the sage's teachings. Sage Lomas later realized the toughness of the curse and recalled Kakbhushundi. Thereafter, he preached him the stories of Rama as per his wish. From there, his love of devotion of Rama had started and he further decided to live his life in the physical form of the crow, as in this form only he came to know about the Rama. Later Kakbhushundi became an ideal narrator of the events of the life of Lord Rama, and as per the blessing of Rama, he has been given the ability to travel through time and recreate the story of the Rama. ==Significance== As per the texts, one of the important quality of Kakbhushundi is that he has been gifted to stand outside of time, meaning as where the nature's cycle repeats itself, so he was able to see Ramayana played out eleven times & Mahabharata sixteen times with different results. ==In the Ramcharitmanas== In the Ramcharitmanas by Tulsidas, Kakbhushundi mentions are found in the Bāl Kāṇḍ (The Child Episode) and Uttar Kānd (The Epilogue). Ramcharitmanas is structured around three separate conversations. The conversations happen between Shiva and Parvati, Sages Bharadwaj and Yajnavalkya and finally Kakbhushundi and the king of birds, Garuda. It has also been said that whenever Lord Rama takes an incarnation on earth in different ages Kalpa (aeon), Kakbhushundi flies away and shifts to Ayodhya to watch the child plays of Rama, because of his devotional love for Rama. == References == Category:Characters in the Ramayana ","title":"Kakbhushundi"},{"id":"56037689","text":"The 1979 Stock Car Brasil Championship was the first season of Stock Car Brasil, with 14 races, beginning on April 22, 1979 at the Autódromo Internacional de Tarumã in Rio Grande do Sul, with José Carlos Palhares at the pole position.

Between then and the two years that followed, many fans and outlets discussed a major need for a new skateboarding game. Developer Marc-Andre Houde described the inspiration for the game as a passion for the sport. Houde also stated the game would be developed using Unreal Engine 4. Originally, the team had planned to build the game in Unity, but the team was attracted to Unreal's multiplayer capabilities.

The song was released as a single by Pony Canyon on March 2, 1988. Despite being included in several subsequent compilation albums, \\"Daite Kuretara Ii no ni\\" was never included in any studio album. An English version of the song was recorded for Kudo's 1998 ballad compilation album Best of Ballade: Current, on which it is dubbed \\"Let Me Sleep In Your Arms\\". ==Background== The release of the song marked a turning point in Kudo's career. The song was promoted as the first single since having \\"stripped\\" herself of the image created for her by Yasushi Akimoto while a member of the Akimoto-produced idol girl group Onyanko Club, commonly regarded as the precursor to AKB48. Her eagerness to sing more mature songs and shed the cutesy image that she had cultivated during that time was met with a positive reception by her then-managing producer Yūzō Watanabe, who encouraged her to pursue recording the song. Reflecting on that transitional time, Kudo has express that Watanabe's support \\"sparked a fire in this 17-year-old's heart\\". The song has enjoyed a steady popularity as a karaoke staple for women across Japan, with it having since been described as a \\"female anthem\\". ==Composition== The song was written by Gorō Matsui, while Tsugutoshi Gotō composed and produced the track. It is composed in the key of F major and set to a tempo of 70 beats per minute. Kudo's vocals span from A3 to C5. Lyrically, the song is about the insecurities and infatuation felt at the beginning stages of a romantic relationship. ==Critical reception== The song is described as a revival of the American pop from the 50s and 60s, but in 1980s fashion. Kudo was praised for singing a song with such sex appeal without hesitation. ==Cover versions== In 2013, Chiaki recorded a cover of the song for Tsugutoshi Gotō's concept album, King of Pops 2. \\"Daite Kuretara Ii no ni\\" was covered by Showtaro Morikubo as part of the Shizuka Kudo-as-sung-by male voice actors tribute album released in 2017. ==Chart performance== \\"Daite Kuretara Ii no ni\\" debuted at number three on the Oricon Singles Chart and stayed on the chart for sixteen weeks.

The film, written, directed, edited and produced by Das, was India's official entry for the Oscars, 2018 in the Best Foreign Language Film Category. The film, chosen out of 28 other entries in India, is also the first Assamese film to be submitted for Oscar consideration. She won India's National Award for Best Film and Best Editor, announced on 13 April 2018 by a Government of India appointed jury headed by filmmaker Shekhar Kapoor. Village Rockstars is the second Assamese film to get national recognition after Jahnu Barua's Halodhia Choraye Baodhan Khai (The Catastrophe). The film traces the story of Dhunu, a girl from a village in Assam who dreams of owning a guitar and forming a rock band. In 2018, GQ India named Das as one of the 50 Most Influential Young Indians of 2018. Doctorate degree has been conferred to Rima Das at the 3rd convocation of Krishna Kanta Handiqui State Open University (KKSHOU) held at the Srimanta Sankardeva International Auditorium on February 3. ==Career== Das made her first short film, Pratha in 2009. She started work on her first feature film Antardrishti (Man with the Binoculars), shot with a Canon DSLR camera in Kalardiya, in 2013. In 2016, Antardrishti was screened at the Cannes Film Festival, the Mumbai Film Festival and the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival in Estonia. It marked the arrival of Ms. Das as more than a self- taught filmmaker. She became a one-woman crew, writing, directing, producing, editing and shooting a film, besides handling art direction and costume designing. Rockstars was Das's second film after Antardrishti (2016). Her 2018 film, Bulbul Can Sing, was premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. In 2019, she directed her first documentary fiction ‘Sunshine Dreamers’. This is a result of her collaboration with BRICS co-production Kids & Glory for which she worked with Producer Lu Chuan and fellow BRICS Directors Tiago Arakilian, Nastia Tarasova, Shen Zhao Qing, Shane Vermooten and Lu Chuan. Das is not trained in any aspect of filmmaking. This, she believes has turned out to be a boon for her career. In her own words, \\"The fact that I am not trained and I didn't go to a film school in a way helped me to explore more and to be true to my vision. Be it the writing, direction, cinematography or editing, I didn't follow a method trained professionals would. I could understand my craft better and create my own kind of cinema. Watching world cinema inspired me and gave me a perspective of global filmmaking. But I think having my own unique style helped me stand out.\\" == Personal Life == Das hails from the village Kalardiya near Chhaygaon in Assam, 50 km southwest of Guwahati. She is the daughter of a teacher. She cleared the National Eligibility Test (NET) after her Masters in Sociology at Pune University. But the desire to be an actor took her to Mumbai in 2003. She acted in plays, including an adaptation of Premchand's Godaan staged at the Prithvi Theatre. she spent hours watching the work of masters Satyajit Ray, Ingmar Bergman and Majid Majidi. == Filmography == *Pratha (Short film) *Man with the Binoculars : Antardrishti (2016) *Village Rockstars (2017) *Bulbul Can Sing (2018) *Neighbors (For Each Other part of the anthology, 2019) *Sunshine Dreamers (2019) ==See Also== * List of female film and television directors * List of LGBT- related films directed by women ==References== Category:Living people Category:Assamese film producers Category:Best Editor National Film Award winners Category:Producers who won the Best Feature Film National Film Award Category:Directors who won the Best Feature Film National Film Award Category:1982 births Category:Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award winners ","title":"Rima Das"},{"id":"56037852","text":"Bernette Beyers (born 17 January 1992) is a South African female track cyclist.

It is a densely-foliaged shrub or small tree, characterised by very narrow leaves and clusters of small white flowers with five petals and a large number of stamens, which are longer than the petals. It grows in the north of the North Island and is the most distinctive of the New Zealand kunzeas. ==Description== Kunzea linearis is a densely-branched shrub or tree which usually grows to a height of up to . It is densely branched, usually forming a rounded canopy up to in diameter. The leaves are densely crowded along the branches, especially near the ends and are hairy, about long, wide and lack a petiole. The flowers are arranged in more or less cylindrical groups of between three and forty, and the individual flowers are in diameter. The floral cup is long, in diameter, cup-shaped or barrel-shaped and usually has a covering of silvery white hairs. There are five sepal lobes long on the rim of the floral cup. The five or six petals are white, cream-coloured or pale pink, egg-shaped to almost round, about long and wide and there are between 40 and 50 cream coloured stamens which are longer than the petals. Flowering occurs between October and February and is followed by fruit which are woody, barrel-shaped capsules long, wide with persistent sepal tips.Kunzea linearis fruit ==Taxonomy and naming== Rawiri manuka was first formally described in 1889 by Thomas Kirk who gave it the name Leptospermum ericoides var. lineare and published the description in his book \\"The Forest Flora of New Zealand\\". In 2014 Peter James de Lange and Hellmut Toelken changed the name to Kunzea linearis. The specific epithet (linearis) is a Latin word meaning \\"linear\\", referring to the linear leaves of this species. ==Distribution and habitat== Kunzea linearis mostly grows in coastal to lowland shrubland in impoverished soils and peat bogs. It mostly occurs in the northern part of the North Island from North Cape south to Ahipara and the Karikari Peninsula and sporadically south of there. It is the most distinctive of the New Zealand kunzeas. ==Conservation== This kunzea is listed as \\"At Risk - Declining\\". The main threats to the species are loss of habitat, collecting for firewood and hybridisation with other kunzeas in urban settings. ==Use in horticulture== Rawiri manuka is most easily propagated from fresh seed.

It was described as a new species in 2012. ==Taxonomy and etymology== Smithers's horseshoe bat was described as a new species in 2012. It was described as a result of a taxonomic split in the Hildebrandt's horseshoe bat (R. hildebrandtii). The holotype--an adult female --was collected in October 2000 in the Gokwe region of Zimbabwe. Its species name \\"smithersi\\" was chosen to honor Reay Henry Noble Smithers, former Director of the National Museums of Zimbabwe. ==Description== This species can be differentiated from sympatric members of its genus by its high echolocation frequencies, small cranium, and wide nose-leaf. Its mean echolocation frequency is 40-46 kHz. The forearm length of the holotype is . Its nose-leaf is wide. The sella has long hairs and narrows at its tip. The lancet is relatively long and straight. The fur of its back is grayish-brown, with individual hairs long. Its ventral surface is paler than its back. ==Range and habitat== This species is known from one individual in Zimbabwe and 19 sites in South Africa. During the day, it roosts in natural or man-made underground cavities. ==Conservation== It is currently evaluated as near threatened by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this designation because it has small colony sizes, its occurrence is scattered throughout the landscape, it is limited by roosting site availability, and its population size is thought to be small (perhaps fewer than 1,000 individuals).

Married twice with five children, Johnson was originally from Louisiana, but had settled in Kentucky's Louisville metropolitan area by the 1980s. Throughout his life, Johnson claimed to have been involved with many prominent Americans and in many important US events, however evidence would later come to light disputing most of these claims. After becoming involved with Christianity in his youth, Johnson traveled with missionaries in Tennessee and South America before founding a controversial Louisville-area church in the late 1970s—Heart of Fire Church. With Johnson as its \\"bishop\\", Heart of Fire eschewed the trappings of traditional Christian churches, and instead at times featured toplessness, cigarette-smoking, underage drinking, anti-Islamism, and a tattoo parlor. Following arson in 2000, the church was rebuilt after Johnson was sued by his insurance provider. In the 2010s, Johnson became politically active, and despite a controversial campaign that included his own party leadership asking for his withdrawal, he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives from the 49th District. After 11 months and nine days in office, an exposé by the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting was publicly released; it included many refutations of Johnson's self-described biography, as well as details about a 2013 child sexual abuse allegation. After denying the accusations of his alleged victim, Johnson committed suicide by gun on December 13, 2017. According to Johnson's Kentucky House of Representatives profile, he was a Republican, a Kentucky Colonel, and a member of the National Rifle Association of Kentucky. ==Personal life== On October 18, 1960, Danny Ray Johnson was born to Jerry J. and Charlene Blocker Johnson in Bastrop, Louisiana; he was the middle child between sisters Teresa (older) and Rita (younger). Johnson graduated from Bastrop High School in 1979, and left home at 17-years-old. By his early 20s, Johnson had fathered a child, divorced his first wife--Tylia Harris, and filed for bankruptcy in Louisiana. Per his 1985 Jefferson County Police Department arrest record, Johnson was tall and weighed . Johnson married his second wife, Rebecca Wilson (born ), in Jefferson County, Kentucky on February 14, 1987. By 2017, Johnson resided in Mount Washington, Kentucky, and had five children. Johnson was known for his hate speech, Facebook posts, \\"and general derision for African-Americans and Muslims\\". ==Refuted claims== On October 18, 1985, police in Louisville, Kentucky caught two people with Johnson's 1982 Cadillac Coupe de Ville in Cox Park, by the Ohio River (). The interior and exterior of the car had been covered in gasoline, and its rims and tires had been removed. Under interrogation, the suspects told police that Johnson had given them the keys, paid them , told them to keep the rims and tires, and wanted the car torched while he was celebrating his birthday with ministry co-workers. When brought in that same day, Johnson claimed the vehicle had been stolen, and signed a police report to that effect; after investigators Mirandized the preacher and told him of the confessors, Johnson admitted to paying the arsonists as part of an insurance fraud scheme—the 25-year-old owed over on the Cadillac, which also needed thousands in repairs. Johnson was indicted for felonious \\"complicity to commit arson\\" and a misdemeanor of filing a false police report; after pleading not-guilty and completing a six-month diversion program, the charges were dismissed in February 1987. In later years, Johnson would say of the incident: \\"When the car came up missing, I didn't know what happened to the car. It was vandalized.\\" To Johnson's claim of having been the \\"White House Chaplain\\" to Presidents George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, an expert in the field confirmed that no such position exists; all three presidential libraries also confirmed \\"find[ing] no connection between Johnson and the White House.\\" The Rev. Dr. Cecil Murray of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles refuted Johnson's claim of setting up safe zones in that city during the 1992 Los Angeles riots, not only by virtue of not having seen the \\"golden-haired preacher from Kentucky\\" among the rioting people of color, but also because there were no \\"safe zones\\" during the six-day incident. Johnson regularly told of how he rushed to Ground Zero after the September 11 attacks, created an impromptu morgue, and administered last rites to victims for two weeks. Storm Swain, a professor of theology at Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia who authored a book on chaplains at Ground Zero, invalidated every aspect of Johnson's September-11 claims. In 2017, the Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York knew nobody who remembered Johnson. Johnson's 2016 and 2017 financial disclosures listed New York workers' compensation as his only source of income. Johnson had claimed, at times under oath, to hold a Doctor of Theology, a Doctor of Philosophy, and a Doctor of Divinity, the last of these from Kingsway University and Theological Seminary in Des Moines, Iowa; Kingsway confirmed that Johnson studied there, but said he did not graduate. In his 2016 election campaign, Johnson claimed that Ted Nugent had endorsed his election during a rally at Bowman Field; spokeswomen for the musician and airport both said they had no record of this. ==Religion== Johnson pointed to a childhood miracle as the incident that spurred his religiosity. Johnson said that a childhood accident with a BB gun left him blinded in one or both of his eyes, and that his parents took him to a physician. Johnson would later say that he was seven years old when his blindness was miraculously cured. During his adolescence, Johnson attended the Swartz First Assembly of God Church in Monroe, Louisiana; Pastor Gerald Lewis recalls that Johnson, to whom he was a father figure and mentor, stopped attending church without warning or explanation. After graduating high school at age 17, Johnson left Bastrop to work with the McKeithens—a Christian missions group based out of Nashville, Tennessee—for two years. When Dr. David Fischer was pastor of the Living Waters Church in Pasadena, California, he wrote a letter supporting alleged miracles performed by Johnson while Johnson was on a short-term mission to South America; Fischer said in his June 1991 correspondence that Johnson had cured a Venezuelan man of deafness and resurrected a Colombian man: \\"He spoke to death and commanded it to leave.\\" Heart of Fire Church According to the church's website, Johnson founded Heart of Fire Church in 1977, at 5101 Bardstown Road, with himself as its bishop. Over its lifetime, Heart of Fire has drawn criticism from members of the local community and law-enforcement figures. Johnson frequently proselytized for political candidates (e.g. Donald Trump) from his pulpit, violating the conditions of Heart of Fire's tax-exempt status. Racism, toplessness, cigarette-smoking, underage drinking, Islamophobia, and a tattoo parlor were all reported phenomena at Johnson's Heart of Fire Church throughout the years. Thrice in six years, the church was cited for selling alcoholic drinks without a liquor license; after a 2009 raid by the Kentucky Office of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC), Johnson was fined despite attempting to convince Judge Sheila Collins that the beer that had been hidden from ABC agents was for communion rites. After Dan Johnson committed suicide in 2017, his wife Rebecca took over as pastor of the church. Arson In mid-2000, Brotherhood Mutual Insurance Company showed the non-denominational Heart of Fire Church was bankrupt: loans far exceeded the property's value, any potential sale, and the church's potential to ever settle. The church and Johnsons were also in financial straits with \\"dozens of bounced checks and credit card debts\\". Heart of Fire secretary and parishioner Michelle Cook explained how Johnson committed insurance fraud against Brotherhood Mutual to make money for himself. On June 12, 2000, the church was set afire. When a witness saw a \\"white, late-model Cadillac pulling out from behind the church with no lights on [whose] driver was a white guy who might have had blond hair\\", the blond, 1995 White-Cadillac-owning Johnson instead blamed the Ku Klux Klan, saying the hate group had threatened the church. No charges were ever filed in the arson. The losses were estimated at $1–1.75million (equivalent to about $–M in ). Brotherhood Mutual sued Heart of Fire, saying that the church had been negligent in light of the alleged threats; both parties settled and the church was rebuilt. Foreclosure In the 1990s, the Clinton administration's Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) began offering loan guarantees to rebuild black churches that were victims of arson. In 2003, Heart of Fire received the third-largest of these federal loans for (equivalent to about $M in ); the church used the money to buy the chancel it was leasing, and build a new fellowship hall-cum- bar. In 2019, Clinton-era HUD secretary Henry Cisneros described Heart of Fire's purchase and construction as not \\"meet[ing] the criteria that we originally had set.\\" Less than a month after securing the guaranteed loan, and for the next 14 years, Johnson failed to have the loan forgiven; in 2009, the US federal government obtained the mortgage for Heart of Fire. In February 2019, HUD secured a court order of sale for the church--valued at --as the non-profit was more than in debt to the national government. Heart of Fire was scheduled to hold a May 20, 2018 auction (\\"antiques, appliances, furniture, Harley Davidson parts and commercial kitchen equipment\\"), the purpose of which was described to WDRB by Pastor Rebecca Johnson as: ==Rape allegation== At age eight, Maranda Richmond first attended Heart of Fire Church in 2004 with her father. She became friends with the Johnson children and considered Dan Johnson \\"a second dad.\\" Richmond attended parties and sleepovers that were held at the church building as well as the Johnsons' house; occasionally alcoholic drinks were provided to the children by Johnson and other adults. Richmond told the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting (KyCIR) that she was raped by Johnson 15 days after her 17th birthday (the night of December 31, 2012); she had been staying with his daughter in the apartment under the fellowship hall. The following day, the two exchanged messages over Facebook: {  style=\\"width: 100%;\\" -   } Richmond and her parents went to the police in April 2013, but after failing to secretly record a confession from Johnson, the case was closed with no charges filed. Richmond saw a mental health professional the summer of 2013, and presented her \\"psychosocial assessment, notes and progress reports\\" to the KyCIR in 2017; the onetime honors student and drum major at Louisville Male High School had exhibited symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. After the KyCIR began investigating Johnson, the Louisville Metro Police Department reached out to Richmond and reopened the case at her request, but had made no actions as of five months later. ==Politics== It was the 2010s when Johnson began to zealously express right-wing and libertarian political sentiments. 2016 elections Johnson ran in the Republican Party's primary for the 49th District's seat (representing part of Bullitt County, Kentucky) in the Kentucky House of Representatives; his political campaign mirrored his personal ideals of \\"supporting guns, liberty and pro- life causes.\\" During a political rally at Heart of Fire, the church's billboard read, \\"Pray To Make America Great Again\\". Jennifer Stepp (a former Heart of Fire congregant) originally won the Republican primary, but was found by a judge to have been ineligible to run. The Bullitt County Republican Party executive committee held a secret ballot and selected Johnson as their replacement candidate. In the general election for the 49th District's seat, Johnson faced the incumbent Democrat, Linda H. Belcher (born ). Belcher had held the 49th seat for three terms after replacing her husband in 2008. Johnson eschewed their public debate in favor of making online accusations against Belcher, alleging that she (\\"lyin’ Linda\\") had—among other accusations—instigated death threats and bomb threats, doxxed the Johnsons, and colluded with Barack Obama (\\"the Islam’crat\\") and Hillary Clinton to send \\"Chicago thugs\\" after Johnson's family. Belcher refuted Johnson's claims, but otherwise ran a subdued campaign, focusing instead on her record as representative. Also during his campaign, Johnson made several Facebook posts that racially-targeted the family of Barack Obama, and then refused to withdraw from the race even at the request of the Republican Party of Kentucky. On Election Day 2016, Republican Donald Trump received almost 75% of Bullitt County's votes for president, while Johnson defeated Belcher by 156 votes. Representative Johnson began his tenure in the Kentucky House on January 2, 2017. Despite its unconstitutionality, Johnson filed a bill (Abolition of Abortion in Kentucky Act) to make abortions performed in Kentucky illegal. Physicians who performed abortions under the proposed law could be charged with \\"fetal homicide—a felony that can be charged as a capital offense but isn't eligible for the death penalty.\\" Johnson also filed bills concerning freedom of speech. One such proposal would have forced public universities to allow the promulgation of speech that is \\"offensive, unwise, immoral, indecent, disagreeable, conservative, liberal, traditional, radical, or wrongheaded.\\" The other would require all internet-accessible computers sold in Kentucky to come pre-installed with software to block \\"obscenity, child pornography, revenge pornography, and prostitution.\\" As of November 14, 2017, he was a member of the House's committees on: State Government; Tourism, Small Business, and Information Technology; Transportation; Veterans, Military Affairs, and Public Protection; Elections, Constitutional Amendments, and Intergovernmental Affairs; and Tourism and Outdoor Recreation. ==Exposé and suicide== On December 11, 2017, the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting (KyCIR) released an exposé on Johnson (\\"The Pope's Long Con\\"), the culmination of over seven months of investigations and 100+ interviews. Both Democrats and Republicans called for his resignation from the Kentucky General Assembly. The Republican governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin, called the representative \\"an embarrassment\\", while the Democratic mayor of Louisville Metro initiated a review of Richmond's 2013 allegations. Johnson held a news conference two days later at Heart of Fire Church where he denied the accusations of sexual assault, instead saying that Richmond's claims stemmed from their political differences. That afternoon at , Johnson posted a rambling missive to Facebook. After pinging the assemblyman's phone, police found his body on a bank of the Salt River in Mount Washington, Kentucky; he had shot himself in the head with a .40-caliber pistol. The time of death was recorded as 8:20p.m. The next day, Rebecca Johnson told reporters, \\"These high-tech lynchings based on lies and half-truths can’t be allowed to win the day\\"; on Today, she blamed the KyCIR (\\"that little greasy reporter\\") for her husband's death. Dan Johnson was interred in a Mount Washington cemetery on December 18, 2017. Nominated by the Bullitt County Republican Party, Rebecca Johnson sought election to her husband's position as state representative from the 49th District. Of the 4947 votes cast in the February 20, 2018 special election, Democrat Linda H. Belcher received 68.45 percent; Johnson blamed electoral fraud for her loss. By February 2018, both women were registered for the 2018 general election, though Johnson withdrew the following month, saying, \\"I feel my time can be best served with my family and my ministry\\". ==References== Category:1960 births Category:2017 deaths Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century bishops Category:American politicians who committed suicide Category:bishops in Kentucky Category:burials in Kentucky Category:Christians from Kentucky Category:clergy who committed suicide Category:Kentucky Republicans Category:members of the Kentucky House of Representatives Category:people from Bastrop, Louisiana Category:people from Bullitt County, Kentucky Category:people who died in office Category:suicides by firearm in Kentucky ","title":"Dan Johnson (Kentucky politician)"},{"id":"56038423","text":"Baldface Mountain is a mountain located in Adirondack Mountains of New York located in the Town of Indian Lake south of Indian Lake. ==References== Category:Mountains of Hamilton County, New York Category:Mountains of New York (state) ","title":"Baldface Mountain (Herkimer County, New York)"},{"id":"56038442","text":"Squaw Mountain is a mountain located in Adirondack Mountains of New York located in the Town of Indian Lake south-southwest of Indian Lake. ==References== Category:Mountains of Hamilton County, New York Category:Mountains of New York (state) ","title":"Squaw Mountain"},{"id":"56038466","text":"Burgess Mountain is a mountain located in Adirondack Mountains of New York located in the Town of Indian Lake southwest of Indian Lake.

He was a very successful businessman and was heavily involved in the silk trade of the country.

He founded a splinter group of the Zwi Migdal, called the Ashkenazum, and had over 700 agents working for him in Argentina. Members included pimps, madams, porteras as well as the spouses of the male members. He was the owner of most of the bordellos in San Fernando, a city in the province of Buenos Aires.

Botts was born in Novelty, Missouri on June 8, 1873 to Benjamin and Mary C. Botts. He attended Oaklawn College and later the University of Missouri for law school. By 1900 he was living in Knox, Missouri working as an attorney. In 1901, Botts moved to Oregon where he applied and was seated to the Oregon State Bar. In his first year in Oregon, Botts had a partnership B. L. Eddy which ended shortly thereafter. Botts was swept into office with other prohibition candidates in Tillamook, Oregon in 1905 after defeating R.W. Watson, who The Oregonian dubbed \\"the saloon candidate\\". Botts ran for re-election unopposed in 1906. The Oregonian noted there was little opposition to the prohibition beliefs of Botts. As mayor he participated in a ceremonial event celebrating the beginning of construction on the Tillamook span of the Pacific Railway and Navigation Company railway. In November 1907, Botts dismissed two fines levied against men who were arrested at a gambling establishment because according to Botts they proved that they had not been gambling at the time of the raid by Tillamook County Sheriff Hank Crenshaw. Following his mayoral tenure, Botts stayed active in local politics as the president of the Tillamook Development League in 1908. As president he promoted the construction of roads throughout the county. Along with George B. Lamb and Carl Haberlach, Botts incorporated the Tillamook Lumber Manufacturing Company in 1908 with $10,000 in stock. Their previous venture was destroyed by a fire. The following year he incorporated the Mason, Pennington Company with $20,000 in operating stock with Homer Mason and A. A. Pennington. At the commencement for the class of 1911 seniors at Nehalem High School in Nehalem, Oregon, Botts was the guest speaker. In 1912, Botts was nominated by the Republican Party to be the Oregon State Senate District 22 which represented Lincoln, Tillamook and Washington counties. He was running against incumbent W. H. Hollis, a Democrat. Botts was nominated to run against incumbent mayor John R. Harter in 1912, but would go on to lose the race. Tillamook County District Attorney T. H. Goyne appointed Botts to the office of Assistant District Attorney in 1915. Botts was one of the three incorporators of the Wheeler Development Company in August 1919 with an initial capital stock of $20,000. The following year Botts joined First National Bank of Tillamook as their vice-president, serving alongside David Kuratli. Botts had previously served in that same capacity for the same bank in 1910. In 1963, Botts died and was interned at the Tillamook IOOF Cemetery and Mausoleum. ==References== Category:American temperance activists Category:Businesspeople from Oregon Category:Oregon Republicans Category:University of Missouri alumni Category:Mayors of places in Oregon Category:Oregon lawyers Category:People from Tillamook, Oregon Category:1873 births Category:1963 deaths ","title":"Hosea T.

Essentially, the design consists of a moving bolt driven by a piston with gas pressure from the gas port behind the muzzle. The bolt drops down into receiver recess and locks on bolt closing. Tilting the bolt up and down locks- unlocks in the breech. This tilting allows gas pressure in the barrel from firing the gun to lower to safe levels before the cartridge case is ejected. This is in contrast with rotating-bolt mechanism of almost all modern repeating rifles. For handgun design; tilting barrel is very popular with Browning style operating mechanism.

In early January 2009, Amuro appeared on a Vidal Sassoon commercial that promoted its Japanese products, and a snippet of \\"Dr.\\" was televised. \\"Dr.\\" was written, composed, arranged and produced entirely by long-time collaborator Nao'ymt, and recorded at Azabu-O Studios in Minato, Tokyo during the end of 2008. Amuro felt that the release of this new record was a fresh start for her career. Additionally, several publications reported the track to be a mixture of \\"opera, electro, techno and R&B;\\" music, something influenced throughout the parent album. The singer's record label, Avex Trax, confirmed that \\"Wild\\" and \\"Dr.\\" would be released as a double A-side single. The single premiered on March 18, 2009 with Amuro's recording \\"Wild\\". It was distributed in two physical formats in Japan and Hong Kong; a standard CD that included the singles and their instrumental tracks, and a second bundle that included the same track list on one disc, and the music videos to each recording on a second DVD disc. The recorded versions were published for digital consumption on March 25, 2009. The cover art was photographed by Shoji Uchida, featuring Amuro in a black hooded vest, with chains tangled around her wrists. ==Composition== Musically, \\"Dr.\\" is a mid-tempo dance number that is influenced by modern club music, and also samples an orchestral section from the musical piece \\"Boléro\\" through its pre-chorus sections, composed by French conductor Maurice Ravel. According to Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express, he compared the \\"dance\\" sound to many contemporary artists in the Western market. The song opens with a \\"futuristic\\" generic robotic vocal stating \\"Access... please press enter after input your wish,\\" and features the sound of a heartbeat in the background to carry the song's pace. The Ravel sample includes various orchestral arrangements for 11 seconds in each pre-chorus, and leads straight back to the song's original dance sound. Bradley Stern from MuuMuse noted the tracks \\"mash\\" of several song styles, and pointed out R&B; and opera being some of them. Similarly, online catalogue Selective Hearing described it as \\"all-over-the-place\\", and said that the pre-chorus \\"breaks off into some sort of weird stacatto, marching band type stuff...\\". Lyrically, it is a love song that talks about \\"erasing the wounds from the past\\", and embracing the future as lovers. Additionally, the song uses the titular term to metaphorically describe Amuro's lover. ==Reception== \\"Dr.\\" received mixed reviews from most music critics. On a positive note, Japanese magazine CD Journal commended the tracks arrangement, Amuro's vocal deliveries, and its status as being a single. As part of the album, the magazine complimented the tracks lyrical content and Nao'ymt's \\"futuristic\\" production. An editorial review from Billboard Japan describe the song as \\"gorgeous\\", where as Takuro Ueno from Rolling Stone Japan called it \\"fantastic\\" and highlighted it as one of the album highlights. Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express heavily lauded the track, describing it as her own \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". He also complimented the tracks sense of prosperous, in terms of genre development with her future music. Western website Selective Hearing gave it an average remark, labelling it \\"alright\\". The blog complimented the tracks \\"nice start\\", until they criticized the \\"strange\\" orchestral sample and felt it \\"wrecked the flow of the song\\". Additionally, they concluded, \\"If that part were taken out or revised I would have thought better of it.\\" MuuMuse editor Bradley Stern was critical towards the tracks leaked demo, saying \\"it appears to be one, massive hot mess of song.\\" However, as part of Past Commercially, \\"Dr.\\" was a success in Japan. Charting with \\"Wild\\", the single debuted at number one on the Oricon Singles Chart, selling 75,456 copies in its first week. This resulted in being her eleventh overall number-one single, her second consecutive number-one, and essentially her first single to debut atop of the Oricon charts since her 1998 single \\"I Have Never Seen\\". Additionally, \\"Wild\\" and \\"Dr.\\" are her last singles to reach number one in Japan. The following week, the single fell to number eight, selling 17,996 units. Overall, the singles ranked in the charts for 17 weeks, and sold a total of 119,352 copies in the region. It was ranked at number 45 on Oricon's yearly chart. As a stand-alone track, \\"Dr.\\" debuted at number 64 on the Japan Hot 100 chart, provided by Billboard, and peaked at 39. The song was certified in two different categories—physical sales and ringtone purchases—by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for separate sales of 100,000 copies. ==Promotion and live performances== \\"Dr.\\" has been performed on three concert tours in Asia. Its first appearance was on her 2008-2009 Best Fiction Tour, which was placed during the concert's fourth segment.

An introduction to igneous and metamorphic petrology. New York: Prentice Hall. It is generally located 4–8 km below the ocean floor and the major lithologies are mafic (ultramafic and gabbroic rocks) which derive from melts rising from the earth's mantle.Coogan, L., 2003. The lower oceanic crust. This part of the oceanic crust is an important zone for processes such as melt accumulation and melt modification (fractional crystallisationGrove, T.L., Kinzler, R.J. and Bryan, W.B., 1993. Fractionation of mid‐ocean ridge basalt (MORB). Mantle flow and melt generation at mid-ocean ridges: 281–310. and crustal assimilation). And the recycling of this part of the oceanic crust, together with the upper mantle has been suggested as a significant source component for tholeiitic magmas in Hawaiian volcanoes.Sobolev, A.V., Hofmann, A.W., Soboloev, S.V., and Nikogosian, I.K., 2005, An olivine-free mantle source of Hawaiian shield basalts: Nature, v. 434, no. 7033, pp. 590–597, . Although the lower oceanic crust builds the link between the mantle and the MORB, and can't be neglected for the understanding of MORB evolution, the complex processes operating in this zone remain unclear and there is an ongoing debate in Earth Sciences about this. ==Processes== The lower oceanic crust connects the earth's mantle with the MORB, where around 60% of the total magma production of the Earth happens. The three main processes happening in this region of the oceanic crust are partial melting of the earth's mantle, melt accumulation at various depths and the chemical modification of this melts during ascent,.Grove, T.L., Kinzler, R.J. and Bryan, W.B., 1993. Fractionation of mid‐ocean ridge basalt (MORB). Mantle flow and melt generation at mid-ocean ridges: 281–310.J. Leuthold, J. C. Lissenberg, B. O'Driscoll, O. Karakas; T. Falloon, D.N. Klimentyeva, P. Ulmer (2018); Partial melting of the lower oceanic crust at spreading ridges. Frontiers in Earth Sciences: Petrology: 6(15): 20p; This three processes do not happen in a strict order but occur all simultaneously over a depth range of 4–18 km suggesting that these processes can occur already in the upper mantle. The mantle melts are most commonly modified by fractional crystallisation due to coolingGrove, T.L., Kinzler, R.J. and Bryan, W.B., 1993. Fractionation of mid‐ocean ridge basalt (MORB). Mantle flow and melt generation at mid-ocean ridges: 281–310. and by assimilation of crustal rocks. ==Spreading rates== The most important parameter controlling the processes operating in the lower oceanic crust is the magma supply, this is further controlled by the spreading rate, and therefore, spreading rate is a critical variable in models for the formation of the lower oceanic crust.Sinton, J. M., & Detrick, R. S. (1992). Mid-ocean ridge magma chambers. Journal of Geophysical Research, 97(B1), 197. The rate at which plate divergence occurs at mid-ocean ridges is not the same for all ridge segments. Ridges with a spreading rate less than 3 cm/a are considered slow-spreading ridges, while those with a rate greater than 5 cm/a are considered fast- spreading ridgesWilson, M. (1989). Igneous Petrogenesis. A Global Tectonic Approach. Geological Magazine (Vol. 126).  Fast spreading ridges  Intensive search spanning over three decades of seismic imaging have shown that the ridge axis is underlain by a crystal mush containing a small percentage of melt,Crawford W. C. and Webb S. C. (2002) Variations in the distribution of magma in the lower crust and at the Moho beneath the East Pacific Rise at 9°–10°N. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 203. 117–130. capped by a thin melt lens containing a generally high, but variable melt fraction.Singh, S.C., Kent, G.M., Collier, J.S., Harding, A.J., Orcutt, J.A., 1998. Melt to mush variations in crustal magma properties along the ridge crest at the Southern East Pacific Rise. Nature 394, 874–878. The completely liquid body is a thin and narrow sill-like lens (10 to 150 m thick and < 2 km wide).Detrick, R. S. et al. Multi-channel seismic imaging of a crustal magma chamber along the East Pacific Rise. Nature 326, 35–41 (1987). The lens is maintained by reinjection of primitive magma.Perfit, M., Fornari, D., Smith, M., Bender, J. F., Langmuir, C. H., & Haymon, R. M. (1994). Small-scale spatial and temporal variations in mid-ocean ridge crest magmatic processes. Geology, 22, 375–379. The lack of any detectable large magma chamber and the common detection of small lens/mush zone at fast-spreading ridges emphasize the small magma chamber model. Modally and compositionally layered gabbroic rock is often found (or abundant) in the lower crustal sections of ophiolite.Anonymous, 1972. Penrose field conference on ophiolites, Geotimes, 17:24–25 The layered lower crust is thus one of the key features of all models of fast-spreading lower crust. Nevertheless, distinct modal layering as observed in major ophiolites has rarely been observed or sampled on the ocean floor. The IODP expedition 345 was one of the first drilling project, which sampled a significant thickness of layered igneous rocks. A shallow melt can erupt through cool crust and produce sheeted dikes and volcanics, but the small chamber seems difficult to resolve with traditional ideas of fractional crystallization and crystal settling to form the thick sequence of layered gabbros and foliated gabbros and ultramafics. One proposed model is the so- called \\"gabbro glacier\\",Sleep NH (1975) Formation of oceanic crust: some thermal constraints. J Geophys Res 80:4037–4042 where crystals settle in a shallow melt-dominated lens beneath the ridge axis. The weight of the accumulating crystals settling to the bottom of the magma lens induces a ductile flow and deformation within the gabbros, just like the ice in a glacier responds to accumulated snow. Nevertheless, the model fails to explain the layered variations in mineral types, the correlated layering in mineral compositional variations, and the apparently primary near-vertical fabrics in the upper gabbros that appear to represent subvertical melt conduits.Kelemen, P., Koga, K. and Shimizu, N., 1997. Geochemistry of gabbro sills in the crust- mantle transition zone of the Oman ophiolite: implications for the origin of the oceanic lower crust. Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 146: 475–488 Kelemen and co-workers concluded that most of the lower oceanic crust crystallized in place, and proposed \\"the sheeted sill\\" model.Kelemen, P. B. & Aharonov, E. (1998). Periodic formation of magma fractures and generation of layered gabbros in the lower crust beneath oceanic spreading ridges. In: Buck, W., Delaney, P. T., Karson, J. A. & Lagabrielle, Y. (eds) Faulting and Magmatism at Mid-Ocean Ridges. American Geophysical Union, Geophysical Monograph 106, 267–290. In the model the sills form when porous flow of rising basaltic liquids (or small melt-filled fractures) are stopped beneath permeability (earth sciences) barriers of earlier crystallized melts and pond to form the sills. Cooling rates are generally sufficiently slow that crystals and their interstitial liquids are in chemical equilibrium, as long as the liquid is immobile. However, buoyancy and/or compaction (geology) may induce liquid migration through the mush, resulting a significant compositional and microstructural modification.Holness MB, Hallworth MA, Woods A, Sides RE (2007) Infiltration metasomatism of cumulates by intrusive magma replenishment: the Wavy Horizon, Isle of Rum, Scotland. J Petrol 48(3):563–587 Slow spreading ridges Slow- and intermediate-spreading ridges form typically valleys about 30 to 50 km wide and 1 to 5 km deep, with step-like inward facing scarps, similar to rift valleys on land. Compared to fast spreading-ridges, the magma supply and therefore the heat flow is low and can't maintain a persistent liquid magma chamber.Sleep NH (1975) Formation of oceanic crust: some thermal constraints. J Geophys Res 80:4037–4042 Sinton and Detrick (1992) modelled a schematic cross section of an axial magma chamber beneath a slow-spreading ridge such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Due to the reduced heat and magma supply, a steady-state eruptible magma lens is relinquished in favor of a sill-like mush zone and a smaller transition zone beneath the well-developed rift valley. Convection and mixing in the magma chamber is far less likely than at fast ridges.Sinton, J. M. & Detrick, R. S. Mid-ocean ridge magma chambers. J. Geophys. Res. 97, 197–216 (1992). Thermal constrains led to the development of different models to reconstruct the accretion history. The \\"infinite leek\\" model suggests small magma batches, forming small \\"nested\\" intrusions.Nisbet, E. G., & Fowler, C. M. R. (1978). The Mid‐Atlantic Ridge at 37 and 45° N: some geophysical and petrological constraints. Geophysical Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, 54(3), 631–660. Another model proposed that crystallization could occur at depth, where temperatures are higher, the formed cumulates are then \\"dragged\\" up by mantle flow to form the lower oceanic crust.Elthon, D., Casey, J. F., & Komor, S. (1982). Mineral chemistry of ultramafic cumulates from the North Arm Mountain Massif of the Bay of Islands ophiolite: Evidence for high-pressure crystal fractionation of oceanic basalts.

Petrology and geochemistry of the lower, ocean crust formed at the East Pacific Rise and exposed at Hess Deep: a synthesis and new results. Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst.

This model is referred to as a \\"plum pudding\\", where the lower oceanic crust is constructed from a number of nested plutons that crystallize within the mantle or crust.Cannat, M. (1993). Emplacement of mantle rocks in the seafloor at mid-ocean ridges. Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, 98(B3), 4163–4172. Schwartz et al. (2005) describes another variant.

Her father Gustavas Nymand was reported to be a ‘Cockney Jew’, but the nationality of her mother was not known. She left home at 16 to join a theatre company and five years later married the man whose name she was most commonly known by. She claimed to have been a singer, clown, and theatre proprietress, with a childhood ambition to be famous by accomplishing something no one else could do. Having struggled to make a name for herself as an actress, Anderson and her husband became managers of a theatre in Cardiff. In 1877 her husband died, leaving Anderson on the brink of bankruptcy. == Career in pedestrianism == Anderson's interest in pedestrianism started in 1877 when she met British champion racewalker William Gale at an event in Cardiff. Unlike other working class pedestrians such as Emma Sharp who claimed to do no formal training, Anderson was trained by Gale who specialized both in pedestrianism and sleep deprivation. After training for six weeks with Gale, Anderson made her pedestrian debut in Newport, Wales in September 1877. She walked 1,000 half- miles (0.8 km, or 805 km total) in 1,000 half-hours and got no more than 20 minutes rest at one time during the entire three-week trek. There were several days of rain which required her to walk with an umbrella and a lamp but this did not prevent her from finishing. Her second walk was planned to be 1,250 half-miles (2,012 km total) in 1,000 half-hours in Exeter, October 1877, which would break a record of total) in 1,000 hours set by Captain Robert Barclay, but that had to be abandoned when a storm blew in. This did not deter Anderson and Gale, and they were able to accomplish that feat in Plymouth later that year. In addition to breaking the distance record by , by starting each at the beginning of the hour (rather than completing two consecutive miles as Barclay did) Anderson completed the event with much shorter rest periods. After this event Anderson was referred to in the press as a ‘Champion Lady Walker of the World’. Anderson's first indoor event was a 28-hour walk again in Plymouth. However, the pollution from gas lamps and cigars gave Anderson problems breathing. After falling a number of times she collapsed unconscious after completing . Following this failure Anderson went to the press and claimed she would ‘never take on another event she would not finish’. She completed 1,344 quarter-miles in the same number of quarter-hours in Plymouth and every hour for 28 days in Boston before attempting to equal Gale's record of in 1,000 hours. Anderson started the event on 8 April 1878 and completed the event on 20 May 1878. Two days later, she got married for the second time to William Paley, a theatre man. After completing three more walks during the summer of 1878, Anderson established herself as the dominant pedestrian in the UK. Therefore, on 13 October 1878, with the aim of making a name for herself in the US, Anderson, Paley, her manager Webb and her assistant Elizabeth Sparrow sailed in the steamship Ethiopia across the Atlantic. ==Mozart Garden – US debut== Anderson's manager Webb wanted to launch her US debut (2,700 quarter- miles (1,086 km total) in 2,700 quarter-hours) in Glimore's Garden (which later became Madison Square Garden). However, William Kissam Vanderbilt, the venue's owner rejected their request claiming ‘The woman will never accomplish the feat and nor can any woman’. This led Webb to approach Mozart Garden, a smaller venue in Brooklyn which was refurbished for the event, reducing the seating from 2,000 to 800 to make way for a track which was surrounded by an railing and measured by Brooklyn's city surveyor to ensure accuracy. The venue was so small that the track was only in circumference, requiring Anderson to walk seven laps to complete each quarter of a mile (400 m). A ‘privacy tent’ was built for Anderson to use during her short rest periods containing a bed and a makeshift kitchen including a stove. Walking 2,700 quarter-miles in so many quarter-hours was an accomplishment never attempted by any person before in the US, requiring an ability to endure severe sleep deprivation, leading the champion US pedestrian Daniel O'Leary to claim ‘he would not attempt it’. The event was so popular that the spectator fee was raised from 25 cents to 50 cents after 5/6 of the event had been completed. By the final day of the event ticket prices were $1 for standing and $2 for reserved seating. As many as 4,000 people a day came to see Anderson during the event which started on 16 December 1878. She completed the event on 13 January 1879 to a venue so packed that police had to prevent additional spectators. Many of the spectators were women who it was reported regarded Anderson as 'the most wonderful of their sex'. Ada Anderson singing There were numerous checks and judges to ensure the integrity of the event and doctors who checked on Anderson concluded that she had trained herself to cope with sleep deprivation, since she had no more than nine minutes sleep at a time during the entire 28-day event. into the event Anderson played the piano and sang Verdi’s \\"Back to Our Mountains\\" during her rest period and became known for such entertainment during the walk. Over the next few weeks she continued to entertain the crowds with impromptu singing and speeches. Anderson had a number of celebrities come and walk with her during the event including 75-year-old boxer Bill Tovec, General Tom Thumb and Texas Jack. She also entertained the crowd by marking the faces of sleeping spectators with coal. Because of the heavy wagers on the completion of the event, Anderson required protection in the final days of the walk. There were reports of attempted gassing with chloroform although Anderson denied this. With only half a mile to go Anderson sang ‘Nil Desperandum’ to the crowd before completing her penultimate lap. Her final quarter of a mile was then completed in 2 minutes 37 seconds the fastest of all 2,700. The total receipts of the event were reported to be $32,000 of which Anderson's personal share was reported to be $8,000. Ada Anderson chalking faces of spectators ==Health, sleep and nutrition== When asked by reporters about fatigue, Anderson claimed her biggest problem was often with blisters and the pain of them preventing her sleeping. However, the sleep deprivation became apparent even within the first two days, where she had periods of stumbling through the walk in an almost semi-conscious state before appearing as lively as she was at the start a few hours later. In these sleepy periods her assistant Sparrow had to prepare her to walk at the three-minute warning bell, and on occasion had to send her back to the track when she hadn't completed the required seven laps. After , the regular check by the physician noted she had a temperature of , pulse 78–80, with her only complaints being badly blistered feet and mental anxiety interfering with sleep. Mike Henry, Anderson's coach, who walked with her for much of the event, was not in such good health with blisters covering his feet and suffering from exhaustion and dizziness. He had to retire, being replaced by one of the race judges, Charles Hazelton. Anderson ate at almost every rest time, unless she was sleeping, and her diet included beef, oysters, corned beef, potatoes, cakes and grapes; she drank beef tea, port wine and occasionally champagne. ==Critics of pedestrianism== Local magistrates in Boston, UK, objected to walking on Sundays believing that it corrupted morals. However, Anderson found support in the local mayor who claimed that Boston was ‘more moral than Plymouth’ where Anderson had last walked on a Sunday. The New York Times was also critical of Anderson's journey stating it had no ‘\\"skill\\" attributes’ and the sport ‘leads people to bet on any absurd performance of uncertain issue’. There were others who claimed that it was cruelty for a woman to be put through such suffering and claimed during her walk in Chicago that her husband coerced her. To these criticisms Anderson responded ‘I am walking against my husband's wishes’. Reverend Steele of the Third St. Methodist Church published sermons in a number of newspapers criticizing pedestrianism for a number of reasons, including walking on a Sunday. ==Anderson's feats of pedestrianism== *September 1877 – 1000 half miles in 1000 consecutive half hours (500 miles in 500 hours) Newport, Wales. *November 1877 – 1 ¼ miles every hour for 1000 hours.

Originally a farm house, it was expanded to mansion proportions through various alterations and additions made by later owners, as well as by the city which had acquired the property in 1869 for the expansion of Fairmount Park. George Clymer, a Founding Father of the United States, owned the house between 1784 and 1794, though he apparently only rented it out and never lived there. A notable feature of the house is the use of round windows, including two small oval windows, one on each of the first and second stories of the northwestern facade, and a divided semicircular window in the southeastern gable. Though the main part of the house is composed of Wissahickon schist, several wood-frame extensions with stone foundations adjoin the northeastern end of the house. These extensions include a two-story gable-roofed addition with clapboard siding and a large chimney on the northern corner, and another two-story clapboard addition to the east with a gable roof including a dentilled cornice and a semi-octagonal wall. Finally, a one-story clapboard kitchen wing was attached to the northeastern wall. Two barns and an ice house also stand on the property. Since 1997, the house has been leased and operated by the Cancer Support Community Greater Philadelphia (CSCGP) through the Fairmount Park Conservancy's Historic Preservation Trust.\\"Leasing Success Story: Ridgeland\\".

He presented the Tonga U-17 national football team at the 2011 OFC U-17 Championship in New Zealand. ==Playing career== Early career In 2011, he switched from Football to Rugby and started aged 17, at Apifo'ou College and represented Tonga U20 at the IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy in 2014, before moving to New Zealand in 2015, initially on a development contract with Tasman. On 20 April 2018, Frizell scored three tries against the in a Super Rugby match at Eden Park. His performances for the Highlanders earned him a call-up for New Zealand's national rugby team, the All Blacks, having been tipped by the media for an unlikely All Black debut. With injury to Vaea Fifita, Frizell made his debut for the All Blacks on 23 June 2018 against France. Frizell started the game at blindside flanker, playing 71 minutes on debut. Frizell had to be taken to the blood bin in the 22nd minute, due to an eye injury, so was temporarily replaced by Highlanders team-mate Jackson Hemopo, who was also on debut for New Zealand. Frizell came back on in the 31st minute and stayed on for the rest of the test, which the All Blacks won 49-14. Frizell went on to start three times for the All Blacks during the 2018 Rugby Championship, in the absence of the injured regular starter, Liam Squire. Frizell was one of the standout performers in the first test against Argentina, on 8 September, playing the full 80 minutes at his homeground in Nelson, scoring his first try for the All Blacks as they won 46-24. Frizell unfortunately failed to make an impact in the final two tests of the competition, including the 32-30 victory over South Africa, 6 October. The All Blacks were drawing 6-6 at halftime, with Frizell subbed off 46 minutes into the test. With Vaea Fifita re-called, Frizell was dropped for the All Blacks' end-of-season tour for 2018. Rookies Gareth Evans, Dillon Hunt and Dalton Papalii were also chosen over Frizell. 2019 After some strong performances in the 2019 Super Rugby season, where he was among the highest try-scorers, with six tries, Frizell earned a re-call for New Zealand's 39-man Rugby Championship squad. On 31 July 2019, Frizell and four other players, including Highlanders teammate, Josh Ioane, were dropped from the All Blacks, having performed poorly against South Africa in a 16-16 draw. Frizell was subsequently released back to Tasman for the 2019 Mitre 10 Cup, where he re- established his place as a regular starter for the province. Luke Jacobson's concussion problems continued, which ruled him out of the 2019 Rugby World Cup, to Frizell's benefit. Frizell immediately flew to Japan after Jacobson's injury, to re-join the 31-man All Blacks squad and has played 1 match off the bench versus South Africa and started against Canada and Namibia scoring in the Canada test. == References == Category:Tongan people of Welsh descent Category:Tongan rugby union players Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Association footballers not categorized by position Category:Tasman Mako players Category:Highlanders (rugby union) players Category:Rugby union flankers Category:Rugby union locks Category:Rugby union number eights Category:New Zealand international rugby union players ","title":"Shannon Frizell"},{"id":"56039653","text":"Alex Fidow (born 19 August 1997) is a New Zealand rugby union player who plays for the in the Super Rugby competition.

It represents an embedding of a graph with three self- loops onto the projective plane. In topological graph theory, a ribbon graph is a way to represent graph embeddings, equivalent in power to signed rotation systems or graph-encoded maps. It is convenient for visualizations of embeddings, because it can represent unoriented surfaces without self- intersections (unlike embeddings of the whole surface into three-dimensional Euclidean space) and because it omits the parts of the surface that are far away from the graph, allowing holes through which the rest of the embedding can be seen. Ribbon graphs are also called fat graphs. ==Definition== In a ribbon graph representation, each vertex of a graph is represented by a topological disk, and each edge is represented by a topological rectangle with two opposite ends glued to the edges of vertex disks (possibly to the same disk as each other). ==Embeddings== A ribbon graph representation may be obtained from an embedding of a graph onto a surface (and a metric on the surface) by choosing a sufficiently small number \\\\epsilon, and representing each vertex and edge by their \\\\epsilon-neighborhoods in the surface. For small values of \\\\epsilon, the edge rectangles become long and thin like ribbons, giving the name to the representation. In the other direction, from a ribbon graph one may find the faces of its corresponding embedding as the components of the boundary of the topological surface formed by the ribbon graph. One may recover the surface itself by gluing a topological disk to the ribbon graph along each boundary component. The partition of the surface into vertex disks, edge disks, and face disks given by the ribbon graph and this gluing process is a different but related representation of the embedding called a 'band decomposition., 1.1.5 Band Decompositions, pp. 7–8. The surface onto which the graph is embedded may be determined by whether it is orientable (true if any cycle in the graph has an odd number of twists) and by its Euler characteristic. The embeddings that can be represented by ribbon graphs are the ones in which a graph is embedded onto a 2-manifold (without boundary) and in which each face of the embedding is a topological disk. ==Equivalence== Two ribbon graph representations are said to be equivalent (and define homeomorphic graph embeddings) if they are related to each other that a homeomorphism of the topological space formed by the union of the vertex disks and edge rectangles that preserves the identification of these features. Ribbon graph representations may be equivalent even if it is not possible to deform one into the other within 3d space: this notion of equivalence considers only the intrinsic topology of the representation, and not how it is embedded. However, ribbon graphs are also applied in knot theory, and in this application weaker notions of equivalence that take into account the 3d embedding may also be used. ==References== Category:Topological graph theory ","title":"Ribbon graph"},{"id":"56039803","text":"The 2017 Carling Black Label Cup was the seventh edition of the Carling Black Label Cup to be held.

Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship reduces the risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It is one of the most reliable ways to avoid STIs. Those who choose mutual monogamy can be tested before the sexual relationship to be certain they are not infected. This strategy for the prevention of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection requires that each partner remain faithful and does not engage in sexual activity with another partner. Mutual monogamy differs from serial monogamy which is a current monogamous relationship that has not been established in the past and may not continue into the future. Serial monogamy may not result in the reduced risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection because the past sexual exposures to infection are brought into the new relationship, even though it may be exclusive of other sexual partners. The risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection while in a serial monogamous relationship is the same as the risk of those who have concurrent partners. Those with a greater ability to communicate about their commitment are likely to sustain the relationship. When individuals are mutually monogamous, and are free from STIs/HIV when they enter the relationship, the risk for being infected with STI/HIV acquisition from sexual intercourse is very low. A mutually monogamous relationship lowers the risk of HIV, cervicitis, and other sexually transmitted infections. A mutual monogamous sexual relationship often includes a pledge to stay with the partner and includes the desire for the relationship to last, a psychological attachment and the lack of being able to find another partner. If these conditions remain a priority for both, the \\"couple is likely committed and mutually monogamous.\\" Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and has negative STI test lowers the chance of acquiring gonorrhea.

He had confessed to the murder days after it occurred. As a result of a guilty plea, Wilson did not receive a trial by a jury, and was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in 1987. He was incarcerated from 1986 to 1995. In September 1995, Wilson was pardoned by the governor of Missouri, Mel Carnahan, citing that Wilson's confession was coerced, and that there was no evidence tying him to the crime. ==Events== On April 13, 1986, seventy-nine-year-old Pauline Martz was found dead in her home in Aurora, Missouri. She was beaten, bound and gagged, and left for dead in her house, which had been set ablaze. The authorities also believed that she had been sexually assaulted. An autopsy would reveal that Martz died of carbon monoxide poisoning as a result of the fire. Several days later, the police brought in Johnny Lee Wilson, a mentally challenged twenty-year-old, for interrogation. He was interrogated for over four hours, before confessing to the murder. Wilson was initially connected to the case through an eyewitness, who told police that Wilson revealed implicating information to him at the scene during the fire, though he would recant his statements. Among the evidence against Wilson was women's underwear and jewelry that was found at his residence, which the authorities theorized was taken by him after the murder. However, the items were never confirmed as coming from the Martz home. Wilson was charged with first-degree murder and, in order to avoid the death penalty, pleaded guilty. He received a life sentence without parole. In 1988, a man serving time for murder in Kansas, Chris Brownfield, confessed to the murder of Pauline Martz with an accomplice who was not Wilson. He told the authorities that they robbed Martz, and decided to burn the house down due to losing a stun gun that had their fingerprints. However, his confession was deemed unreliable by officials. ==Appeals and exoneration== With the confession from Brownfield, Wilson filed a motion to receive a trial by a jury in June 1989. The judge, David Darnold, denied his motion, citing that Brownfield's confession was not credible. In addition, he also ruled that Wilson was capable of comprehending the charges against him despite his mental condition. In July 1991, the Supreme Court of Missouri denied Wilson's request for a trial by jury, concluding that he understood the guilty plea. In 1993, Wilson requested a pardon from then governor of Missouri Mel Carnahan, and was granted in September 1995, after a one-year investigation of the case. It concluded that there was no physical evidence tying Wilson to the crime, and that the authorities took advantage of Wilson's mental defect to coerce a confession. However, Brownfield has not been prosecuted for the crime, nor anyone else, and the murder of Martz remains unsolved. Wilson settled with Lawrence County for $615,000 in 2003, after filing a federal lawsuit. ==In the media== Wilson's case was featured on television programs, Unsolved Mysteries, The Reporters, and Inside Edition. ==See also== *Crime in Missouri *List of unsolved murders *List of wrongful convictions in the United States ==References== Category:1986 in Missouri Category:1986 murders in the United States Category:Crimes in Missouri Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:People murdered in Missouri Wilson, Johnny Lee ","title":"Johnny Lee Wilson case"},{"id":"56040049","text":"PSAD Kodam VI/MLW Balikpapan or PSAD is an Indonesian football club based in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan. ==Honour== * Liga 3 ** Fourth-place: 2017 ==References Category:Football clubs in Indonesia Category:Military association football clubs in Indonesia ","title":"PSAD Kodam VI/MLW Balikpapan"},{"id":"56040055","text":"Theory of Probability and Mathematical Statistics is a cover-to-cover translation into English of the Ukrainian scientific journal \\"Teoriya Imovirnostei ta Matematichna Statistika\\" which is published by Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv.

It is an independent economic entity with legal person rights, which, on the basis of state property, transfers them to management, carries out entrepreneurial activities. The enterprise has the right to open branches and representations and, with the consent of the public administration body, which organizes the department that exercises control over compliance with the antitrust legislation, to form consortium associations, consortia and other state-owned associations of enterprises on the basis of contracts concluded with other economic agents. The decision on the establishment of the enterprise shall be adopted by the government, at the proposal of the central specialized body or of another administrative authority. The position of founder of the enterprise on behalf of the Government shall be exercised by the authority specified in the Government decision. The board of directors is the collegiate body for the administration of the enterprise, represents the interests of the state and carries out its activity in accordance with this law, and the regulation of the board of the state enterprise approved by the founder. The members of the board of directors must be representatives of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy, which will be the majority, representatives of the founder and the working group. Representatives of other central public administration authorities, industry specialists, economists and law specialists can also join. The company sells its production, works, services and production waste at prices and tariffs established on the basis of supply and demand, and in the cases stipulated by the normative acts - at prices and tariffs regulated by the state. The enterprise's profit (loss) is determined in the manner prescribed by law. Net profit is formed after tax and other mandatory payments are paid and remains available to the enterprise. Net profit can be used for: (a) covering the losses of previous years; (b) the formation of reserve capital; (c) formation of the reserve for the development of production; (d) breakdowns in the state budget; (e) for other purposes, if they do not contravene the legislation. The activity of the enterprise ceases, in accordance with its statute and the founder's decision by reorganizing or liquidating. The enterprise may also be wound up by the competent court in accordance with the law. == State-owned enterprises turn into \\"greenhouses\\" for dignitaries == In 2014, Transparency International Moldova published a report on the transparency monitoring of state-owned companies and joint stock companies with state-owned capital: \\"Transparency International Moldova considers that the legislation regulating the activity of state-owned enterprises needs to be substantially revised, especially in the context of improving the quality and efficiency of business management. In particular, in opinion of experts, more rigorous requirements are needed for the qualification and work experience of the candidates for the position of manager of the enterprise, the remuneration of the administrator with the economic and financial performances of the company, the transparency in the selection process or the appointment of the managers of the enterprises state\\", says Lilia Carasciuc, executive director of Transparency International Moldova. == Law on state and municipal enterprise with regard to organization and operation of the Public Property Agencyhttp://lex.justice.md/index.php?action=view&view;=doc⟨=1&id;=372415 == This law was drafted for the purpose of updating the provisions Law no.146 of 16 June 1994 on the state enterprise. Through this project, the public policies for the management of state enterprises and municipal enterprises will be updated and made uniform to the general norms of corporate governance, the attributions of the founder, the board of directors and the administrator will be clearly defined and delimited. The project regulates the particularities of establishment, operation and closure of the activity of state enterprises and municipal enterprises, the way of setting up, registering, using the assets handed in administration, the component, the attributions and the responsibility of the governing bodies. In order not to allow the alienation of the assets assigned to the public domain and the goods with a social destination, the payment of the obligations to the state and other creditors with the mentioned goods, it is proposed to establish a special legal regime for them with the separate registration in the accounting records. It is proposed to extend the attributions of the board of directors of state and municipal enterprises. Several industry experts' remarks show that some Moldovan state and municipal enterprises use the single-source procurement procedure to purchase goods and services: this generates significant risks, including potentially higher payments than market prices and a favorable environment for corruption. In order to diminish this phenomenon in the project, it is foreseen that the government will be responsible for the elaboration of the Model Regulation on the purchase of goods, things and services at the state and municipal enterprise. This project proposes the setting up of the censor commission within the state / municipal enterprises, which will exercise the control over the economic and financial activity of the enterprise on a semi-annual basis. At the same time, for the purpose of excluding agreements between two or more parties, through which certain rights, goods are transferred or a commercial exchange is made within the enterprise, the project includes provisions for governing the settlement of conflicts of interest transactions. The necessity to include provisions on the voluntary dissolution of the state enterprise and the municipal enterprise results from the fact that currently, in the State Register of Legal Entities, there are about 320 state-owned enterprises uncontrolled by the founders, which do not work for many years, and usually, do not have any material goods. There is the risk of state liability towards the obligations of the state- owned enterprise, arising from the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, the state is responsible for any debt of the enterprise. In order to observe the principle of maximum transparency in the activity of the state enterprise, the draft stipulates that the documents and the information are to be placed on the website of the enterprise, the founder and the Public Property Agency. ==Notes== Category:Moldovan law ","title":"Law on State Enterprises in Republic of Moldova."},{"id":"56040096","text":"Bloomberg London is an office building in London, which was opened in 2017. It is owned by Bloomberg L.P. and functions as their European headquarters. It is at 3 Queen Victoria Street, to the west of Walbrook, on the site previously occupied by Bucklersbury House. ==Design and build== The building was designed by architects Foster and Partners with structural engineer AKT II, and constructed by Sir Robert McAlpine at a cost of £1bn. It consists of two buildings, divided by a covered arcade. The buildings are linked by bridges. The arcade contains several restaurants, and reinstates part of Watling Street, an ancient Roman road. Prior to construction, archaeological digs at the construction site yielded a collection of Roman-era inscribed wooden tablets now known as the Bloomberg tablets. The building is clad in 9,600 tonnes of Derbyshire sandstone with bronze ventilation fins. Inside, the floors are linked by custom glass lifts and a 210m helical bronze \\"ramp\\", which dominates the interior of the building. The cores of the building are on the outside, to create a single open-plan space inside. Express lifts take visitors from the lobby, a self-supporting \\"vortex\\" of three curved timber shells, to the double-height pantry on the sixth floor, with view of St Paul's Cathedral. Then visitors must take a second lift or use the ramp to access other floors. The building houses 4,000 staff, with room to expand. All desks are electric adjustable-height. The building features artwork by Olafur Eliasson and other artists. Outside, there is a three-part sculpture called \\"Forgotten Streams\\" by Cristina Iglesias, which evokes the Walbrook river. In July 2018, the RIBA announced that Bloomberg London had made the shortlist of the 2018 Stirling Prize along with Bushey Cemetery, Chadwick Hall, the new build at Tate St Ives, Storey's Field Centre and Eddington Nursery and the Sultan Nazrin Shah Centre. In October it was announced as the overall winner. ==Energy usage== The building is noted for its energy-efficiency. It achieved a 98.5% score against the BREEAM sustainability assessment method, the highest design-stage score ever achieved by any major office development. Rainwater is collected from the roof to supply the vacuum toilets. The office floors are illuminated with 500,000 LEDs. The ceilings are custom aluminium \\"petals\\", inspired by the pressed metal ceilings of New York, which act as light diffusers, cooling elements and acoustic attenuation. The design and building process of the building has been criticised as wasteful: it required developing specialised solutions not applicable anywhere else, and the construction required 600 tonnes of Japanese bronze and 10,000 tonnes of imported Indian granite, rather than using locally-sourced or recycled materials. == Bank Tube station entrance == As part of the construction of the building, a new entrance to London Underground's Bank and Monument station complex was built. This provides direct access to the Waterloo & City line via four new escalators and two lifts – providing step free access for the first time. Construction of the new entrance began in November 2015, and the new entrance was officially opened by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and former Mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg in December 2018. The new entrance incorporates etched glass panels by artist John Hutton, depicting 66 figures based on the ancient Roman history of the area, including the Roman Temple of Mithras. The artwork was originally completed in 1962 on Bucklersbury House, the post war office building previously located on the site. ==Mithraeum== The building is on top of the site of the London Mithraeum. The Mithraeum was relocated to a different site in 1962, but as part of the construction of Bloomberg London it was relocated to close to its original site. It is open to the public. The building also contains the Bloomberg Space, which displays artworks. == Gallery == File:Bloomberg London lobby - 3.jpgalt=Wooden lobby with metallic sculpture in the ceilingThe main lobby or \\"vortex\\", with the artwork No future is possible without a past by Olafur Eliasson File:Bloomberg London central ramp - 2.jpgalt=Interior of an office building with a large spiral bronze coloured ramp between floorsPart of the central ramp on the upper floors File:Bloomberg London central ramp - 3.jpgalt=Spiral bronze coloured ramps connecting floors in an office building, viewed from aboveLooking down on the central ramp and lower floors File:Bloomberg London office space.jpgalt=An office space, highlighting the aluminium ceiling \\"petals\\"Office space, highlighting the aluminium ceiling \\"petals\\" File:Bloomberg London pantry.jpgalt=A dining space, with large floor-to- ceiling windows and a view of St. Paul's CathedralThe double-height \\"pantry\\" space, with view of St. Paul's Cathedral File:Bloomberg London model - 2.jpgalt=Cutaway model of the building's interior, showing the various floors and central rampA cutaway model of the building ==References * Bloomberg London official website London Category:Buildings and structures in the City of London Category:Information technology company headquarters in the United Kingdom Category:Mass media company headquarters in the United Kingdom Category:Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank buildings Category:Office buildings completed in 2017 Category:Office buildings in London ","title":"Bloomberg London"},{"id":"56040144","text":"Guedel stages of anesthesia, commonly takes place here. Coinduction in anesthesia is a pharmacological tool whereby a combination of sedative drugs may be used to greater effect than a single agent, achieving a smoother onset of general anesthesia.

The onset or induction phase of anesthesia is a critical period involving the loss of consciousness and reactivity in the patient, and is arguably the most dangerous period of a general anesthetic. A great variety of coinduction combinations are in use and selection is dependent on the patient's age and health, the specific situation, and the indication for anesthesia. As with all forms of anesthesia the resources available in the environment are a key factor. ==Commonly used coinduction regimens== A standard coinduction regimen for an adult might consist of a benzodiazepine sedative amnesic such as midazolam, followed by an opioid analgesic with further sedating properties such as fentanyl which has a fast onset, then an intravenous induction agent: propofol. A muscle relaxant such as atracurium would be administered after this, though this would not strictly be a part of coinduction. For a child on the other hand, a commonly used regimen would be fentanyl, ketamin and rocuronium. In all cases the choice of agents would be tailored to the situation; for a neonatal intubation the aforementioned regimes would be inappropriate as sedation and especially amnesia are less important. Fentanyl alone would be used, followed by the short-action muscle relaxant suxamethonium: coinduction is typically not used in neonatal anesthesia. ==References== Category:Anesthesia Category:Pharmacology Category:Sedatives ","title":"Coinduction (anesthetics)"},{"id":"56040154","text":"The Lion of St. Mark is an award given each year at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity for a lifetime of services to creativity in communications.

Suzu ware pottery has been found in many locations along the coast of the Sea of Japan as far north as Hokkaido, indicating that it was a common trade good for the coastal commerce. The Muromachi period was a golden age for Suzu ware, but it soon went into decline, and vanished by the time of the Sengoku period, unable to complete with large-scale production in areas such as Tokoname. In recent times, however, production of pottery along those traditional lines has resumed. Suzu ware was fired in tunnel-shaped kilns built into hill slopes, at over 1100 degrees. Upon extinguishing the fire, the furnace opening and the flue were sealed to starve the kiln of oxygen, causing the iron contained in the clay to turn into a characteristic shade of dark gray. No glazing was used, but some works have a natural whitish glaze caused by ash present within the kiln. Suzu ware products were typically made for everyday use, typically storage pots, water jars, or ribbed mortars used for grating food. Suzu city has a museum dedicated to exhibits of Suzu ware with detailed explanations of its history and production process.http://go-centraljapan.jp/en/sightseeing/detail_446.html ==Suzu Pottery Kiln Sites== The is a designated National Historic Site of Japan., covering 12 separate locations in what are now the cities of Suzu and Noto where the ruins of kilns used to make Suzu ware have been found. The sites are distributed over a 15 km east to west, by 20 km north to south region, and contain over 40 kilns and were built between the 12th and 15th centuries.

He graduated from Helsinki Goldsmith’s school in 1956. Since the very beginning of his career Weckström has been a highly ambitious designer and artist. At first his works represented clean Scandinavian style, but in 1960s Weckström found his own, totally new style which is closer to sculpture than traditional goldsmithing. == Jewelry and glass == Rough matt surfaces, uncut semi-precious stones and asymmetrical forms are typical to his massive golden jewelry. Inspiration comes often from nature. When working in silver, Weckström can for example portray the snowy, Finnish winter landscape with its frozen lakes. Weckström considers jewelry as an art form and his designs as miniature sculptures. In 1963 Björn Weckström started co-operation with jewelry manufacturer Kruunu-Koru Oy (later Lapponia Jewelry) and its owner Pekka Anttila. Weckström became company’s designer and art director. In 1965 Weckström took part in the International Jewelry Contest in Rio de Janeiro, where his yellowgold and tourmaline necklace “Flowering wall” won the Grand Prix. Through this distinguished award, the company received worldwide recognition, launching Lapponia’s international success. His designs have been in continuous production with Lapponia ever since. Probably the best-known piece of Weckström’s jewelry is necklace Planetoid Valleys which Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) wore in George Lucas’ film Star Wars in 1977. Necklace was designed for Lapponia in 1969. Björn Weckström was the first designer who radically combined silver and acrylic in jewelry. Especially silver-acrylic ring Petrified lake achieved international attention when Yoko Ono was filmed wearing it on the Dick Cavett Show in 1975 For Nuutajärvi glass factory Weckström has designed, inter alia, glassware series “Kanerva” and “Fortuna” and produced dozens of unique glassworks together with factory’s glassblowers. In 2010s he has worked together with glassblower master Kari Alakoski. ==Sculpture == The artistic walk of life of sculptor Bjorn Weckstrom is characterised by impressive series of work, shaped in materials such as bronze, marble, glass and acrylic resin, as well as in often surprising combinations of the above. The invitation to become a lecturer at the University of Pisa in 1979, led to an important change in his life: thereafter Weckström spent the majority of his time in Italy for 30 years. Inspired by Riace bronzes 1980 Weckström started to make narrative bronze sculptures. His distinctive language of expression ranges from abstract form to an individualistic interpretation of realism. Central to the bronze sculptures has been the reinterpretation of classic Greek mythology. Furthermore, the large sculptures, exploring the interaction between man and machine, outline a profound analysis of the current state of Mankind. == Public commissions == * HYY Group, Kaivopiha, Helsinki: sculpture “Together” 2018 * \\"The whistling City-dweller\\"-sculpture, Helsinki 1995 * YLE Headquarters, Helsinki 1993: sculpture \\"Narcissos\\" 1993 * Monument in honour of Fazer's 100th Anniversary, Helsinki: \\"Fazer's rooster\\" 1991 * Fazer Headquarters, Vantaa: sculpture \\"Domina\\" 1989 * Wallrelief for Rettig Strengberg, Turku 1986 == Honours == * Cavaliere Ordine della Stella d” Italia 2017 * Espoo City Medal 2016 * Professor's title 1986 * Pro Finlandia medal 1971 * Medal for merit no. 22 of the Finnish Goldsmiths' Association 1967 * Winner of the Lunning Prize == Exhibitions == More than 60 exhibitions in Europe, USA, Australia and Asia in 1963–2016 Björn Weckström is said to be one of the most charismatic and cosmopolitan personalities of the Finnish art world. Nowadays Björn Weckström lives in Espoo, Finland, but travels to Italy several times a year. He has an atelier both in Finland and in Italy.

Their slogan was \\"'n Roxy?....ja graag!\\" (\\"a Roxy?....yes please!\\"). The brand was developed specifically as a cigarette which contained lower tar and nicotine. Although in the advertising for the cigarette references to health damage by smoking were avoided, scientific publications about the effects of smoking led to the creation of this cigarette. The consumer consciously wanted a safer smoke. In 1962 the Consumentenbond did a comparative study of the tar and nicotine content in various cigarettes, in which Roxy had the lowest levels of tar and nicotine. As a result, the market share of Roxy grew compared to the other cigarette brands. Dutch celebrities like John Kraaijkamp Sr. starred in various Star commercials during a time when tobacco advertising was still allowed. In 1978, the football player Johan Cruyff starred in an advertising campaign called \\"Johan Cruyff: Rook verstandig\\", in which Cruyff promoted the Roxy Dual filter cigarette: \\"Maar ik vind: als je rookt, moet je wel verstandig roken\\" (\\"But I find: if you smoke, you have to smoke consciously\\". After complaints from mainly Konsumenten Kontakt, the ad was promptly banned by the Reclame Code Commissie (Advertising Code Committee). The brand disappeared completely from the market in 2005, after a ban on cigarettes ads was put in place by the Dutch government in 2003. ==Packaging== The first packs had a mix of blue and black, but later a lighter shade of blue was used instead. The first cigarettes were packed in packs of 20 pieces, a box of 50 pieces, a flat tin box of 50 pieces and a round tin box of 50 pieces. There was a sliding box of 5 pieces as well, but that one was not available for sale, and it's speculated it was used for adverts instead. ==Markets== The brand was mainly sold in the Netherlands. It was exported to Germany and Italy. ==See also== * Cigarette * Tobacco smoking * British American Tobacco ==References== Category:British American Tobacco brands ","title":"Roxy (cigarette)"},{"id":"56040531","text":"Jeremiah Smith (died 1723), divine, was minister of a congregation at Andover, Hampshire, and in 1708 became co-pastor with Samuel Rosewell of the Silver Street Presbyterian Chapel, London.

Early in his life, the family moved to a suburban neighborhood in Turin, where there was a Salesian oratory which would have much influence on the formation of the whole Carretto family. The Salesian spirit would also be felt in the professional life that Carretto began at the age of eighteen as an elementary teacher in Gattinara.  Social Activism  He entered the youth sector of the Catholic Action in Turin at the age of twenty-three by the invitation of its then president Luigi Gedda. After completing his studies, he graduated in Philosophy from Turin. From 1936 to 1952, his involvement in Catholic Action grew until he became its National Youth President. In 1940, after winning a competition, he was sent to be the Educational Director in Bono, Sardinia. But his involvement there was short due to conflicts with the Fascist regime and the influence his teachings exerted on young people beyond the bounds of the school. So he was sent to Isili and then back to Piedmont. There he was allowed to resume his work as a teaching director at Condove, in Susa Valley, about 30 kilometers from Turin. With the advent of the Italian Social Republic, he received from Rome the task of reorganizing the structure of the Catholic Action of Northern Italy. From a business point of view, he was removed from the list of teaching directors and kept under surveillance for not having joined the regime. At the end of the war in 1945, Caretto and Gedda jointly created the National Association of Catholic Masters in Rome. In 1946 he became the national president of the Italian Youth of Catholic Action (GIAC). In 1948, on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the foundation of Catholic Action, he organized a large youth demonstration in Rome which became known as the famous gathering of the three hundred thousand \\"Green Basque\\". Shortly thereafter he founded the International Office of Catholic Youth, of which he became the vice president. In 1949, with his friend Enrico Dossi, he created a new agency within the GIAC dedicated to young people's tourism. In time it would become the Youth Tourism Center (CTG), of which he was the first national president. In 1952 Carretto found himself in disagreement with an important part of the Catholic political world that desired an alliance with the political right. He had to resign from his position as president of GIAC. It was at this time that he decided to join the religious congregation of the Little Brothers of Jesus which had been founded by René Voillaume and inspired by Charles de Foucauld.  Religious Life  On December 8, 1954 he left for the novitiate of El Abiodh, near Oran, Algeria. For ten years he lived an eremitical life in the Sahara composed of prayer, silence and work, an experience he expressed in Letters from the Desert, as in all the books he would later write. The same experience fed his whole life and his subsequent action. There he rediscovered his old friend Arturo Paoli, who also passed from the leadership of Catholic Action to religious life in the Sahara Desert. He returned to Italy in 1965 and settled in Spello, Umbria, where Leonello Radi (a former president of GIAC) managed to have the fraternity of the Little Brothers of the Gospel entrust the former Franciscan convent of San Girolamo, near the cemetery. Brother Carlo was enthusiastic about the new arrangement. Leonello Radi said: \\"the main activity of Carlo Carretto was the eight hours of prayer a day, I carried it I do not know how many times with my red beetle, during the trip we talked and, above all, we prayed\\". Soon the spirit of initiative of Carretto and the prestige it enjoys opened the community to the reception of those who, believers or not, wished to spend a period of reflection and search for faith lived in prayer, in manual work and in the exchange of experiences. At the convent where the Fraternity was, many country houses scattered on Mount Subasio were added, transformed into hermitages named after various holy figures. For over twenty years, Coretto was the animator of this center flanked by its many collaborators, friends and benefactors, including the Roman engineer Renato Di Tillo who was very important for the activity of the group and a fraternal friend also of Saint Teresa of Calcutta.  Later life  During these years he continued his activities as a writer. One notable book of that period was the Small Family Church which provoked controversy in the Catholic world over whether the ideas it expressed align with Christian morality. A man of the word and of the pen, he used these two means very effectively to communicate to others his \\"discoveries\\" and his experience of faith. His books have been translated into many languages creating a group of readers in many countries around the world. Consequently, he was often invited to bring his word to conferences and spiritual meetings. His deep interiority did not isolate him from the world and from his problems but instead pushed him to take an interest in the spirits of \\"prophecy\\" (i.e. preaching) and service. Despite his retirement, he has always participated in the events of Italian society. In 1974, during the debate around the referendum on divorce, he joined the group of \\"Catholics for the No\\", opposed to the repeal of the law on divorce already in force. However, the Italian Catholic Action remained his first love, never forgotten. In 1986, when internal conflicts with the National Presidency of ACI pushed Pope John Paul II to recall the association to a more visible commitment in the world, Carretto wrote a Letter to Peter in which he passionately defends the \\"religious choice\\" pursued by the ACI of the new Statute and its President Alberto Monticone. Carlo Carretto died in his hermitage of Saint Jerome in Spello on the night of Tuesday 4 October 1988, the feast of Saint Francis of Assisi, of whom he had been a biographer. == List of Works Published in Italian == * Carlo Carretto.

He is best known for his hasty execution and its effect on colonial Jamaican government. ==History== Jamaican officials had been working to curb rampant privateering in the region since the tenure of Lieutenant Governor (and former buccaneer) Henry Morgan. To the dismay of English lords eager to find allies in Europe, privateers would regularly abuse their legal commissions to attack shipping of all nations. Using a privateering commission from Governor D’Ogeron of French Tortuga, Browne sailed from Jamaica in October 1676 with a multi-national crew. Early in 1677 he captured the Dutch West Indies Company slaving ship Golden Sun off Cartagena, killing several of its officers and crew. That May he reappeared in Jamaica trying to sell slaves to local plantations. Governor Vaughn dispatched a frigate to collect most of the slaves from the planters who had purchased them illicitly. He then wrote to the Governor of Dutch Curacao to warn him of Browne’s piracy. England had passed an act in April 1677 forbidding English subjects from serving foreign governments, and shortly after passed a similar Act pardoning all privateers who surrendered within a year. Browne and his crew turned themselves in soon afterwards. Upon inspection, his privateering commission from Tortuga was found to be expired: Governor D’Ogeron had been dead for over a year. They were tried and convicted for piracy. The crew were pardoned but Browne was sentenced to be hanged in July. Browne twice petitioned the Jamaica Assembly for a reprieve so that he could be set free under the terms of the \\"Act of Privateers\\". The Assembly tried to intervene for him but Vaughn ordered Brown executed immediately. He argued that setting Browne free would set a bad precedent (\\"hindering the sentence of execution will be of evil example and bad consequence\\"); the Assembly countered that “if this execution take place all our privateers which are out may think this Act a snare and possibly make those already in go out again.” The Assembly’s Chief Justice Samuel Long and Speaker (and future governor) William Beeston ordered Browne’s execution delayed, but Browne had been hanged only minutes earlier: “Half-an-hour after, the Marshal came with an order signed by the Speaker to observe the Chief Justice's writ of habeas corpus.” Vaughn was incensed with Long and Beeston and dissolved the Jamaican Assembly. He charged both with a series of insubordinations over the Browne privateering affair and sent them back to England to answer for their crimes. English officials not only supported Long and Beeston instead of Vaughn, but removed him from power and installed the Earl of Carlisle as governor in his place.Before Carlisle, ex-privateer Henry Morgan was briefly named acting Governor once more. After going through three governors in two years, it took until mid-1679 for Jamaica to repay the Dutch West India Company for the loss of slaves to Browne's piracy, and then only when the Lords of Trade and Plantations forced Carlisle to do so. The following year (1680) Carlisle levied the same charges against Justice Long that Vaughn had, still holding him accountable for the \\"disorderly\\" manner in which he had handled Browne's trial. ==See also== *Thomas Lynch, Lord Archibald Hamilton, and Nicholas Lawes – three other Jamaican Governors known for their dealings with and struggles against pirates and privateers ==References== Category:17th-century pirates Category:Year of birth missing Category:English mass murderers Category:English pirates Category:English privateers Category:Executed mass murderers Category:People executed for piracy Category:1677 deaths Category:Caribbean pirates ","title":"James Browne (pirate)"},{"id":"56041028","text":"Shahenshah () is a 1970 Marathi historical fiction novel by N S Inamdar.

One of the lesser known leaders of the rebellion, Kisio was the highest ranking Mau Mau leader from the Maasai community. He fought alongside Turesh ole Tikani and Muntet ole Nkapiani. Although little is known about him today, Kisio's role in the freedom movement was important because it shows the Mau Mau Uprising was not a Kikuyu-only affair. According to Mau Mau chronicler Karari Njama, ole Kisio was the fourth most powerful man within Mau Mau ranks. He had an army of about 800 fighters operating from Melili Forest in Narok. ==Background== Although subdued by colonial domination and disease decades earlier, the Maasai were not all collaborators as most historical narratives of the rebellion portray them. Instead, there were at least two large scale units in Maasailand, one in Narok led by Kisio and another in Kajiado. Their grievances were primarily about land, since a large chunk of the land the new colony was built on, including the capital city Nairobi, had been part of Maasai grazing grounds. General ole Kisio was one of many Maasai men who were recruited to fight for the British Empire during the Second World War. He left Kenya when he was 15 in the same group as Turesh ole Tikani and Muntet ole Nkapiani, who became his lifelong friends. When they returned, Kurito, now aged 19, married Miriam Enekurito, a Kikuyu girl whose family had settled in Narok. He then joined the freedom movement. One of his first roles in the rebellion was to ferry stolen guns and other equipment from Narok to Elementaita and Nyandarua. Later, he became one of the most important leaders of the rebellion. ==Death== Because of his involvement with the rebellion, Kisio's wife was arrested, beaten and detained. Kisio was lured from the forest by two of his friends in Rotien, Narok in 1954. He was shot and killed, and his body paraded outside a hospital. His friend and second-in-command, General Nkapian was captured and also paraded publicly in a cage before he was hanged, marking the effective end of the Maasai role in the mainstream Mau Mau rebellion. Kisio's role in the movement, as at the highest decision-making levels, shows the nationalistic composition of the rebellion. The highest rank was given to Dedan Kimathi, although at least three others held the position of Field Marshal. ==References== Category:People of the Mau Mau Uprising Category:1954 deaths Category:Year of birth missing ","title":"Kurito ole Kisio"},{"id":"56041140","text":"Kenyonville is a hamlet in Orleans County, New York, United States.

She served between 1951 and 1975 as a Bremen senator. Between 1967 and 1975 she was deputy president (deputy mayor) of the state of Bremen (\\"Freie Hansestadt Bremen\\"). That meant that in 1967 she became the first woman to reach that position in any of the eleven states (\\"Bundesländer\\") of the German Federal Republic (West Germany). == Life ==  Provenance and early years  Annemarie Gesine Schmidt was born in Werderland, a part of Bremen's Burglesum quarter, on the city's northern side, where she grew up alongside her elder brother Hans. She came from a traditionally Social Democratic (SPD) family. Wilhelm Schmidt (1883-1975), her father, was one of the most high-profile SPD politicians in Bremen during the Weimar years. He had been removed from public service in 1933 by the Nazis and later spent several years in a labour camp. Directly after the war Wilhelm Schmidt took a leading role in reconstructing the city's administration, and he was one of the authors of the Bremen constitution which came into force in 1947. Annemarie Schmidt attended secondary school locally, in 1934 passing her school final exams (\\"Abitur\\"), which under more normal circumstances would have opened the way to university-level education. The Nazis had taken power at the beginning of the previous year and little by little transformed the country into a one-party dictatorship. She was blocked from training as a teacher because she was deemed \\"politically unreliable\\". That may have been because her father was a known critic of the government. Her involvement in the Young Socialists would also have counted against her. She was, however, able to find an apprenticeship in the book trade, which led to jobs successively in Leipzig, Marburg and Göttingen. Through her work she met the young librarian Werner Mevissen in Leipzig. They were married in 1943. As the war ended during the first part of 1945 Annemarie Mevissen was heavily pregnant. Her parents had relocated to a small house at Oberneuland on the eastern side of Bremen in 1934, and it was to this home that the young couple returned. Their daughter, Ulrike, was born almost at once, in January 1945. Around this same time Annemarie's father was liberated from the labour camp where he had been held, and the (now) three generation family were reunited. The Mevissens' son, Edmund, was born in 1948.  Politics  It would have been conventional for the mother of a new baby to stay at home and care for her child, but Gesine Schmidt, Annemarie's own mother, proved exceptionally able and enthusiastic both in managing the home and as a \\"hands-on\\" grandmother. Far from staying at home, Annemarie quickly plunged into public life outside the home, concentrating in the first instance on youth work. She gathered children from the refugee camps and farmsteads in the surrounding countryside and organised sports and drama based activities for them. A surviving picture from 1947 shows her holding her baby daughter while surrounded by \\"child-friends\\", standing in front of a large round tent that the US army of occupation had made available. Through her father's contacts, Mevissen quickly found her way into city politics. He involved her in his work on the drafting of the Bremen constitution. In October 1946 she was a candidate for election to the city's constitutional assembly, which was the precursor body for a return to democratic city governance. Her election literature placed emphasis on the way that women's exclusion from political life had contributed to the poisoning of politics during the Nazi years, and how important it was that women should now take their place on the political stage. She included the phrase (already widely used by women candidates in the post-Nazi era) \\"equal pay for equal work\\". Although she was narrowly defeated by Friedrich Behrens in 1946, in 1947 Annemarie Mevissen was elected to the Bremen parliament (\\"Bürgerschaft\\"). Still aged only 33, she was the youngest member of the assembly. Not everyone was impressed. Many years later, her SPD colleague Luise Nordhold would recall: \\"Comrades were against it, simply because [she] was a woman\\" („Die Genossen waren dagegen, nur weil Annemarie Mevissen eine Frau war. \\"). Sources also place emphasis on the extent to which it was still unusual for SPD members, whose backgrounds were largely working- class, to have completed their schooling up to the level of the \\"Abitur\\" (secondary school leaving exam). In parliamentary debates the extent of her education enabled Mevissen to contribute, from the start, on equal terms with older male members of the leftwing parties. While Annemarie was drawn into politics Werner Mevissen worked for three decades following the war as the highly effective director of the Bremen public library. In 1951, still the mother of two pre-school age children, she was appointed to the senate by Mayor Wilhelm Kaisen, taking on the schools and youth portfolio. The senate reflected a grand coalition agreement, but the SPD usually dominated the Bremen senate, at this point holding seven of the fourteen places in it: Mevrissen would continue as the Senator for Youth Affairs till 1975 - with \\"Welfare\\" (today \\"social affairs\\") transferred to her departmental responsibilities in 1959. In 1967 Mevrissen was elected to a mayoral position, becoming deputy to the Senate President, fellow SPDS member Hans Koschnick. This made her the first woman to be elected deputy head of any state in West Germany. She retained the position till 1975. That a woman should hold the position gave rise to such am unconventional situation that, at her own request, her official title was always given as \\"Bürgermeister\\" - using the male form of the word in German - rather than \\"Bürgermeisterin\\", the female form that would be used without hesitation today, now that the unspoken taboo on women reaching top positions in politics has been broken (at least in Germany). There is therefore, in the German language, a pleasingly ironical internal contradiction in the title of a biography that appeared in 2011 as \\"Frau Bürgermeister Annemarie Mevissen\\" (and not as \\"Frau Bürgermeisterin Annemarie Mevissen\\" \\"). The newly elected deputy mayor came to national prominence in 1968 in connection with the Bremen tram riots of January 1968. Protests against public transport fare increases were genuine enough, but the passions arising were underpinned by wider political concerns on the part of many students in the context of Cold War tensions and in respect of issues such as the escalation of the Vietnam War. (Unlike the rest of northern West Germany, Bremen had hosted, from the end of the war till 1954, not just the British army, but also a succession of US army units.) Perceiving a risk that the rioting might \\"get out of hand\\", Annemarie Mevissen personally clambered onto a disused packing case and addressed the crowd, finding the right words to steer a dangerous public-order situation back towards dialogue. Background awareness of gender issues is apparent from the way that headline writers (and others) during this period liked to describe her as the \\"only man in the Bremen senate\\". In February 1975, at her own wish, Annemarie Mevissen retired from public office. Despite being only a few months past her sixtieth birthday, she had by this time become the longest serving minister in any of West Germany's federal state governments (\\"Landesregierungen\\").  Active retirement  After dropping out of politics Mevissen gained recognition locally as an artist. Her pictures featuring Bremen themes regularly appear in exhibitions at the Bremen parliament building and elsewhere. She also wrote various books about the city. == Celebration == * In 1975 Mevissen received the Bremen Medal of Honour in gold * On 6 May 2005 her name was added to the Schedule of Bremen's honoured citizens * The children's home Annemarie Mevissen in Bremen's Martin-Buber-Straße was named in her honour. * On 12 November 2014 a hitherto nameless street in Bremen-Wallanlagen has been renamed as the Bürgermeisterin-Mevissen-Weg == Output (selection) == * Am Rande der Stadt Bremen: Oberneuland.

The settlement was established upon lots 40 and 41 along the Ridge Road in the town of Ridgeway on land granted to Seymour Murdock, James Sheldon, Samuel P. Judson, Zephaniah Judson, Amos Spencer, and William McCormick. After Orlando Bates constructed a stone grist mill at this location in 1827, the settlement was named Batesville. When residents discussed the addition of a post office to their community, a meeting was held in order to decide upon a name. Although several names were proposed, no consensus was met until a young schoolboy proposed the name Jeddo. Assumed to be a joke, the crowd adopted the name and disbanded the meeting. Shortly after, Zechariah Haskins received notice of his appointment as postmaster of Jeddo and the settlement's name was solidified. To power the grist mill, and later a saw mill, a ditch was constructed across Ridge Road and a small waterfall was created to provide ample energy. This cleared swampy land to the south of the road, opening additional land for farming. The settlement was also home to a Seventh Day Adventist church organized in 1871 and a Baptist church organized in 1887. == References == Category:Hamlets in Orleans County, New York ","title":"Jeddo, New York"},{"id":"56041400","text":"Cristina Pararoiu (born 17 September 1987) is a Romanian operatic soprano who has performed leading roles at major European opera houses, with a focus on French repertoire such as Bizet's Micaëla, Massenet's Manon and Gounod's Juliette. == Career == Born Cristina-Antoaneta Păsăroiu in Bucharest, she began voice training at age twelve.

He caused scandal and outrage within Russian literary circles, following publication in 1986 of a pornographically- toned diary, ostensibly by Alexander Pushkin. This led to him being described as \\"The Pushkin pornographer\\". == Biography == Mikhail Armalinsky lived all his life in Leningrad till his emigration to the United States on November 17, 1976. He received master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Leningrad Electro-Technical Institute (1964-1970) and actively participated in Leningrad literary underground. He published three samizdat books of poetry there. After emigrating to the US in 1976 and settling in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1977 he worked as engineer and in 1979 started with his father, inventor Israel Peltsman, the machine building company Peltsman Corporation. At the same time Mikhail Armalinsky kept working on his literary works and in 1984 started his own publishing house M.I.P. Company. == Creative output == Mikhail Armalinsky is the author of many books of poetry, prose, essays (see below Selected publications). In 1986 Mikhail Armalinsky published Secret Journal 1836-1837 by Alexander Pushkin in Russian and then English translation. This book created a scandal in Russia and was published in 25 countries http://www.mipco.com/win/AllCovers.html Excerpts from Secret Journal 1836-1837 were published in Penthouse Forum, February, 1991, p. 50-53,84,86 Response of Russian media to this book is documented in several editions of Parapushkinistika by David Bayevsky, published by Armalinsky's publishing house M.I.P. Company. Banned in Russia the Secret Journal was first published in 2001 by Moscow publishing house Ladomir that was threatened and prosecuted for publishing \\"pornographic blasphemy\\". In 2006 Secret Journal was staged in Paris, France. Some attributed the authorship of the Secret Journal to Armalinsky himself. Dr. Lee B. Croft: \\"The pornographic nature of those notes, clearly of a modern Western stripe, drew apoplectic reaction from the Soviet literary authorities who first encountered them. One legal authority, in a sidebar to an article on this \\"hoax\\" in Ogonek magazine,suggested that Armalinsky be castrated for so besmirching the hallowed name of Pushkin. ...his clear feeling of \\"kinship\\" with Pushkin and his choice of Pushkin's persona to gain attention for his own literary endeavors, which have, especially since his emigration to the United States in the early 1980s, taken on a pornographic character strikingly similar to the notes he attributes to Pushkin.\\" Since 1999 Mikhail Armalinsky publishes his blog in Russian named General Erotic (GE) where he publishes his short stories, observations, reviews and essays. In 1989 \\"United State\\" flag designed by Mikhail Armalinsky made the cover of New York City weekly \\"Screw Magazine\\". On September 22, 2003 Armalinsky sent announcements to the media and about his death to check out what would be a reaction to his death. In two months he “resurrected”. == Selected publications == ; Russian *Vrazumlenniye Strasty (Smart Passions), poems, Los Angeles; 1980, 72 p. *Sostoyanie (The Status), poems, Sovremennik, Toronto, 1979, 94 p.

Tyrrell, 581 U.S. ___, 137 S. Ct. 1549 (2017), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Montana courts lacked personal jurisdiction over a railroad that was not incorporated in Montana and did not have its principal place of business in Montana, even though the railroad had more than 2,000 miles of track and 2,000 employees within Montana. It was the first Supreme Court case argued before a Court that included newly appointed Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch. ==Background== This case arose from two separate Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA) actions involving employees of the BNSF Railway Company. The first action was brought by a North Dakota resident who claimed to have been injured while working as a truck driver for BNSF. The second action was commenced by the executor of a South Dakota resident who allegedly died following exposure to toxic substances while working for BNSF. Both plaintiffs filed their lawsuits in a Montana state court, although neither of the plaintiffs resided in Montana and the events underlying their cases did not take place in Montana. BNSF moved to dismiss both lawsuits for lack of personal jurisdiction. The issue reached the Supreme Court of Montana, which sustained jurisdiction on two alternative grounds.Tyrrell v. BNSF Railway Co., 2016 MT 126, 383 Mont. 417, 373 P. 3d 1 (2016). First, the court concluded that personal jurisdiction over the railroad was authorized under Section 56 of FELA, which provides that a FELA action \\"may be brought in a district court of the United States, in the district of the residence of the defendant, or in which the cause of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be doing business at the time of commencing such action,\\" and that \\"[t]he jurisdiction of the courts of the United States under this chapter shall be concurrent with that of the courts of the several States.\\" Second, the court concluded that Montana could also exercise personal jurisdiction because BNSF had substantial operations in Montana, to the extent that it could be deemed \\"at home\\" in Montana for jurisdictional purposes. BNSF sought U.S. Supreme Court review, contending that the first prong of the Montana Supreme Court's decision misconstrued FELA and the second was inconsistent with the U.S. Supreme Court's 2014 decision in Daimler AG v. Bauman.Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 134 S. Ct. 746, 187 L. Ed. 2d 624 (2014). The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari BNSF Railway Co. v. Tyrrell, 580 U.S. ___, 137 S. Ct. 810, 196 L. Ed. 2d 596 (2017). in order \\"to resolve whether [FELA] §56 authorizes state courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over railroads doing business in their States but not incorporated or headquartered there, and whether the Montana courts’ exercise of personal jurisdiction in these cases comports with due process.\\"BNSF Railway Co. v. Tyrrell, 137 S. Ct. at 1555. The case was argued on April 25, 2017. ==Opinion of the Court== Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the Court's opinion, which was joined by all but one of the Justices. The Court reversed the Montana Supreme Court's decision and held that Montana could not properly exercise personal jurisdiction over BNSF in these two cases. Rejecting the Montana court's conclusion that personal jurisdiction could be based upon Section 56 of FELA, the Court held that Section 56 does not relate to personal jurisdiction. Rather, the first cited sentence of Section 56 governs selection of the venue in FELA cases brought in federal courts, and the next sentence confers concurrent subject-matter jurisdiction over FELA cases on state as well as federal courts. Section 56 did not establish a special rule for personal jurisdiction over railroads or other defendants subject to FELA claims.BNSF Railway Co. v. Tyrell, 137 S. Ct. at 1557-58. The Court also concluded that Montana could not exercise personal jurisdiction over BNSF, on claims that did not arise in Montana, consistent with the federal Constitution as the Court had interpreted it in Daimler. The Court's decision in that case establishes that a state may exercise \\"general\\" personal jurisdiction over a corporation if the corporation is \\"at home\\" in that state. A corporation is deemed to be at home in its state of incorporation and the state in which it maintains its principal place of business, but BNSF is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in Texas. While Daimler recognized that a corporation might be found to be \\"at home\\" and subject to general jurisdiction in another state in \\"exceptional circumstances,\\" there were no such circumstances here.BNSF Railway Co. v. Tyrell, 137 S. Ct. at 1558-59. The employees also contended that BNSF had consented to personal jurisdiction in Montana. Because the Montana Supreme Court had not addressed this issue, the Court remanded the case to allow it to do so.BNSF Railway Co. v. Tyrell, 137 S. Ct. at 1559-60. ==Concurring/dissenting opinion== Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a separate opinion, concurring in part and dissenting in part. Justice Sotomayor agreed with the majority that Section 56 of FELA is not relevant to personal jurisdiction. However, she concluded that the Montana state courts could exercise jurisdiction over BNSF consistent with due process. Sotomayor continued to disagree with the Court's holding in Daimler, in which she had filed an opinion concurring in judgment but disagreeing with the majority's reasoning, believing that the International Shoe Co. v. Washington standard should govern the inquiry. However, even if Daimler was correctly decided, the Montana courts should still have jurisdiction. At a minimum, she concluded, the Court should allow the Montana Supreme Court to reevaluate whether this case satisfies the \\"exceptional circumstances\\" test.BNSF Railway Co. v. Tyrell, 137 S. Ct. at 1560-62 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Commentary, BNSF Railway Co. v.

She was powered by a 1,400 horsepower triple expansion engine which was fueled by two coal-fired Scotch marine boilers. Designed by Captain Alexander McDougall to carry bulk cargoes like iron ore or grain economically around the Great Lakes. Whalebacks had a rather unique design. They had an unusual cylindrical, cigar shaped hull that when fully loaded resembled a whale's back. Their hulls were built of heavy steel plates double-riveted to steel angle frames. They were the predecessors of the Doxford turret deck ships of the late 19th and early 20th century, just like whalebacks they had a rounded hull, but unlike whalebacks they had a conventional bow, stern and superstructure. A total of 44 whaleback vessels were constructed from 1888 to 1898, with most operating in the Great Lakes. Service history The whaleback Henry Cort showing off her new trunk deck The Pillsbury entered service on August 17, 1892. She was commissioned by the Minneapolis, St. Paul & Buffalo Steamship Company which was a subsidiary of the Minneapolis, St. Paul & Sault Ste. Marie Railway or the Soo Line. Her homeport was Marquette, Michigan. In 1896 the Pillsbury was renamed Henry Cort On December 17, 1917, the Cort was breaking ice near Colchester Reef on Lake Erie when she was rammed by the larger steel freighter Midvale. She sank into thirty feet of water approximately 4½ miles from Colchester Reef. Her crew walked across the ice to the Midvale. Her wreck was located on April 24, 1918 four miles from where she sank in seven feet of water. She was raised on September 22, 1918, the fourth attempt at raising her was successful, she was then towed to Toledo, Ohio where she was to be rebuilt by the Toledo Shipbuilding Company. Later she was taken to Conneaut, Ohio where she was rebuilt by the Pittsburgh & Conneaut Dock Company; her superstructure was rebuilt and flattened so that a trunk deck could be added. On April 8, 1927, the Cort was sold to the Lake Ports Shipping & Navigation Company of Detroit, Michigan, she also had two new deck cranes installed by the American Ship Building Company of Lorain, Ohio. In March 1927 the Cort stranded in Colchester Reef. She was abandoned to the underwriters as a constructive total loss, she was later sold and repaired. In 1933 the Cort hull was punctured by ice in the Detroit River; she sank while she was tied up at the Nicholson Transit Company's dock in Ecorse, Michigan. ==Final voyage== On 30 November 1934, Henry Cort ran aground, hitting the north side of the Muskegon channel breakwall in Muskegon after encountering a gale with up to 45 mph winds. The US Coast Guard cutter that went to investigate the stricken steamer helped all 25 crew members to safety. One of the Coast Guard crew members died after being washed overboard. Many people on shore watched as the Coast Guard shot a line to the Cort and all members of the crew climbed down from the ship. The ship was broken in two by December storms, and was declared a total loss. The vessel was scrapped in 1935. == References == Notes Citations Bibliography * * Category:Whaleback ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1934 Category:Great Lakes freighters Category:1892 ships Category:Shipwrecks of Lake Michigan Category:Steamships of the United States Category:Ships sunk with no fatalities Category:Merchant ships of the United States Category:Maritime incidents in 1917 Category:Maritime incidents in 1927 Category:Maritime incidents in 1933 Category:Ships built in Superior, Wisconsin ","title":"SS Henry Cort"},{"id":"56041570","text":"wikiFeet is a photo-sharing foot fetish website dedicated to sharing photos of celebrities' feet.

The film stars Dylan Minnette, Piercey Dalton, Sharif Atkins, Patricia Bethune, and Aaron Abrams. The film was released on Netflix on January 19, 2018. ==Plot== A suburban father was killed after being hit by a car. Unemployed and financially unable to support herself and her teenage son Logan, his wife Naomi agrees to move into her sister's secluded mountain chalet until it sells. Upon moving into the beautiful home, Naomi and Logan encounter their elderly neighbor, Martha, who behaves strangely, and Chris, a pleasant store clerk. During the open house days on Sunday, Naomi and Logan are required to leave the property at breakfast and return after 5 p.m. A series of strange occurrences begin. Objects are moved or disappear, the house phone rings but nobody speaks, the pilot to the hot water tank repeatedly gets shut off, and there are unexplained noises. One night, Logan sees a car idling in the driveway. Outside, he finds Martha, who behaves erratically. Martha later alludes to her husband being alive despite previously claiming her husband was dead. A repairman is called to inspect the faulty hot water tank. He reveals that Martha's husband really did die and Martha has Alzheimer's, leading to her confusion. Naomi is crushed when she finds a family photo crumpled up in the trash, and the repairman finds Logan's missing phone near the water heater, leading Naomi to believe that Logan has been messing with her. The two have a heated argument and he denies messing with her or destroying the photo. That night, it is revealed that Evil Boots is lurking in the home. One day, Naomi and Logan find that their home has been broken into and someone has set up a candlelit dinner on the table, but the police find nothing. Unable to afford a hotel, mother and son are forced to remain in the house. Logan contacts Chris, who agrees to spend the night on the couch. In the middle of the night, Chris goes missing, and Logan finds him in his car with his throat slashed. Evil Boots knocks Logan unconscious, pours water over him and leaves him to the harsh winter elements while he goes after Naomi. Naomi is horrified to discover photos of her and Logan sleeping in their beds. She is then attacked, bound and tortured. Logan wakes and finds that all phones have had their SIM cards removed and snapped when he attempts to call 911 for help. He rushes to help his mother, but mistakes her for Evil Boots and stabs her. Naomi tells him to run before collapsing. Evil Boots easily overpowers Logan and removes his contact lenses, leaving Logan unable to see clearly. Logan escapes into the woods and hides. He survives the freezing weather until morning. Succumbing to hypothermia, he drags himself to a stream. Evil Boots reveals himself, grabs Logan as he struggles and screams, and strangles him to death. As we see his lifeless body by the stream, Evil Boots drives towards the next open house event. ==Cast== * Dylan Minnette as Logan Wallace, Naomi’s son * Piercey Dalton as Naomi Wallace, Logan’s mother * Sharif Atkins as Chris * Patricia Bethune as Martha * Aaron Abrams as Brian Wallace, Logan's father * Edward Olson as Evil Boots *Kathryn Beckwith as Joannie Mcallister ==Release== The film was released on Netflix on January 18, 2018. == Reception == The film received an approval rating of 15% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 13 reviews and has an average rating of 2.91/10. == References  * Category:2018 films Category:2018 horror films Category:2010s horror thriller films Category:2010s teen horror films Category:American films Category:American horror thriller films Category:American teen horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films shot in California Category:English-language Netflix original films Category:American serial killer films ","title":"The Open House"},{"id":"56041592","text":"Arnold-Harrell House is a historic house in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, U.S.. ==History== The house was built in 1861 for Edwin Arnold and his wife Harriet McLanahan.

The seventh season began production on September 11, 2017, filming in Richmond, Virginia. Filming wrapped in Budapest, Hungary on March 29, 2018. The writers initially planned for the series' seventh and eighth seasons to comprise a two-season arc, but current events surrounding the U.S. government convinced them to instead continue the arc from Season 6 into Season 7. Showrunner Alex Gansa said \\"Given the swirl of news about the Administration’s war with its own intelligence community, “It was just hard not to do it. It was hard to say ‘OK, let’s go tell a story in Paris. Let’s go tell a story in South America.’ Something very significant is happening in all our lives right now”. ==Reception== Critical response The seventh season of Homeland has received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the season (based on the first episode only) has a score of 65 out of 100 based on 6 reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 80% with an average rating of 7.7 out of 10 based on 19 reviews. The site's critical consensus is, \\"Though it lacks the series' patented agonizing suspense, Homelands seventh season remains an engaging drama by embracing its pulpier elements and pitting Claire Danes' magnetic protagonist against the White House.\\" Accolades For the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards, the series received two nominations–Mandy Patinkin for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and F. Murray Abraham for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.

Cigarettes are manufactured by the firm worldwide except in the US, where Philip Morris USA produces tobacco products. ==History== Philip Morris’ eponymous brand was first made in England, United Kingdom; it was introduced to the United States as early as 1847. Philip Morris incorporated in New York in 1902; until 1929, when the company purchased its first cigarette factory in Richmond, Virginia, their brands were made under license by Stephano Brothers of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Philip Morris English Blend was introduced as a non-filter, regular-size (70 mm) brand in 1933 by Philip Morris USA. To advertise the brand, Philip Morris hired 3-foot, 11-inch tall bellboy Johnny Roventini as their pitchman; through the 1950s on radio, television, and in print advertisements, Johnny would shout out the famous slogan: \\"Call for Philip Morris!\\" Also known as Johnny Philip Morris, Roventini essentially became a living trade mark. The name of Philip Morris English Blend was changed to Philip Morris Special Blend in 1948. In the 1950s, the brand was the sponsor of C.B.S. television’s I Love Lucy show; when it was originally broadcast, the show’s credits would run over a package of Philip Morris cigarettes. When ”I Love Lucy” was packaged for syndication, images of Philip Morris were replaced with the now-familiar heart on satin seen in the end-credits, though the original images have been restored as an extra for the D.V.D. box-sets of the series. Philip Morris was introduced in king-size (85 mm) in 1953, in filter, menthol filter and non-filter; the latter was renamed Commanders in 1960. The brown packaging of Philip Morris was first changed in 1955. The filter varieties were relaunched in 1963 (as Multifilter, featuring a charcoal filter) and 1966 (in Menthol); uniquely, they were both sold in plastic boxes. The non-filtered versions of Philip Morris are still made today by its parent company. The brand is still made and sold by Altria in Argentina, the European Union, Japan, and Uruguay. In Canada, Philip Morris was originally made by the Tuckett Tobacco Company, which had bought out Philip Morris' Canadian subsidiary early in the twentieth century. Tuckett itself was bought by Imperial Tobacco Canada in 1930, although it continued manufacturing until 1966, when Imperial shut down the Tuckett factory and took over its brands. The last survivor in Canada of the Philip Morris brand, the king-sized, plain-end version, was discontinued in the early 1990s. Nowadays the brand is the 15th best selling international brand and Philip Morris' sixth largest international brand, with a volume of 36 billion cigarettes sold in 2016, and the brand is sold in over 40 countries worldwide. ==Advertising== In 1955, Philip Morris sales were at their lowest point- even I Love Lucy wasn't selling them as fast as they wanted the public to smoke them (that's why they dropped their sponsorship of Lucy's program that June). They discovered they needed to change their advertising approach. In Vance Packard \\"The Hidden Persuaders\\" (1957), it was revealed that Philip Morris conducted a survey in mid-1955 to find out why people weren't buying them. Participants were asked to complete this sentence: \\"When I think of Philip Morris, I think of __________.\\" The majority of them answered, \\"irritation\\". This was because in previous advertising campaigns, Philip Morris stressed their brand was \\"entirely free of a source of irritation found in the manufacture of all other leading cigarettes\\"- and people remembered that even when they abandoned that claim after 1953. It was decided they would project a more \\"positive\\" approach- and a different pack replaced the brown one that had been used for at least 40 years. They also \\"retired\\" Johnny Roventini, their famous \\"Call for Philip Morris!\\" bellhop [who'd been a part of their radio, print, and TV ad campaigns since 1933]. By the end of 1955, Philip Morris introduced a white pack with stripes and a new logo, and stressed the word \\"gentleness\\" in their advertising. It worked: according to Packard, first-quarter sales in 1956 were up 26% over the previous year. And Philip Morris continued to use this approach, emphasizing \\"young smokers\\", \\"mildness\\" and a preference for cigarettes \\"without filters\\" towards the end of the 1950s (Liggett & Myers also stressed \\"If you like a mild smoke, but you don't like filters, join the 'Chesterfield People'---get Chesterfield King!\\" in their 1965 ad campaign). By 1958, however, they revived \\"old memories\\" of Johnny, \\"Call for Philip Morris!\\", and \\"On the Trail\\" (from Ferde Grofé's Grand Canyon Suite, used as their musical signature on radio and TV for 22 years) in their advertisings. Veteran actor/announcer Michael Rye was the announcer heard in the 1959 ads. In 1960, they altered their \\"King Size\\" brand into \\"Philip Morris Commander\\". Again, they \\"rewrapped\\" the pack a bit, and stressed a \\"nautical\\" theme in their advertising. Douglas Edwards and the News, CBS' early evening 15 minute newscast [7pm(et) in most areas, with a 7:15pm \\"feed\\" in others], was sponsored on alternate evenings by Philip Morris, who continued to be a regular sponsor after Walter Cronkite succeeded Douglas Edwards in April 1962. Over the years, Philip Morris USA made many poster and television ads to promote the Philip Morris and Commander brand, starting from 1933 and ending in 1966, when the brand started to lose appeal. A special thermometer depicting Marlboro at the top and Philip Morris at the bottom, as well as a Philip Morris Commander lighter were also made. ==Markets== Philip Morris was or still is sold in the following countries: Canada, United States, Mexico, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Romania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, West Germany, Germany, Sweden, Finland, France, Switzerland, Austria, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Greece, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia, and Indonesia. ==In Italy== In June 2015, the brand changed its name and look from Diana to Philip Morris. ==See also== *Cigarette *Tobacco smoking ==References== Category:Philip Morris brands ","title":"Philip Morris (cigarette)"},{"id":"56041797","text":"Agustín Moreno and Jaime Yzaga defeated Petr Korda and Cyril Suk in the final, 7–6(7–3), 6–4 to win the Boys' Doubles tennis title at the 1985 Wimbledon Championships. ==Seeds== # Leonardo Lavalle / Mihnea-Ion Năstase (First round) # Petr Korda / Cyril Suk (Final) # Grant Saacks / Darryl Shapiro (Quarterfinals) # Brett Custer / Patrick Flynn (Semifinals) ==Draw== Draw ==ReferencesBoys' Doubles Category:Wimbledon Championship by year – Boys' Doubles ","title":"1985 Wimbledon Championships – Boys' Doubles"},{"id":"56041830","text":"AU Convention Center is a convention at Beach road, Pandurangapuram, Visakhapatnam it was established in the year of 2017 by Vice-President of India Venkaiah Naidu. ==About== The building cost र 13.5-crore to construct and seating capacity of 2000 seats. ==References== Category:Convention and exhibition centres in India Category:Buildings and structures in Visakhapatnam ","title":"AU Convention Center"},{"id":"56041865","text":"Harold Smith (10 March 1904 – after 1928) was an English footballer who played as an inside left in the Football League for West Ham United.

He remained there for two seasons without playing first-team football, featuring only for the reserve team. When Jimmy Loughlin was sold to First Division club West Ham United in May 1927, Smith and another teammate, George Robson, also made the move. He played only once for the first team, standing in for Vivian Gibbins at inside left for the home match against Manchester United on 29 October; West Ham lost 2–1.

The primary cause of FMD is release of nitric oxide by endothelial cells. To determine FMD, brachial artery dilation following a transient period of forearm ischemia is measured using ultrasound. Because the value of FMD can be compromised when improperly applied, attempts have been made to standardize the methodology for measuring FMD. ==Clinical significance== FMD is a noninvasive measure of blood vessel health (endothelial dysfunction) which is at least as predictive of cardiovascular disease as traditional risk factors. FMD is a sensitive marker for the amount of blood vessel damage caused by cigarette smoke. So-called light cigarettes (having reduced tar and nicotine) were shown to impair FMD as much as regular cigarettes. Improved FMD results in greater perfusion and oxygen supply to peripheral tissue. An Israeli study of 618 healthy subjects found FMD to be an excellent predictor of long-term adverse cardiovascular events. Participants with below-mean FMD were 278% more likely to experience cardiovascular events during the 4.6 year average follow-up period than participant with above-mean FMD (95% Confidence Interval: 135-571%, p-value<0.001). ==Effects of exercise== A study of healthy young men who normally take over 10,000 steps per day, but were restricted to less than 5,000 steps per day for five days showed impaired FMD in the popliteal (leg) artery, but not the brachial (arm) artery. The reduction of leg FMD caused by prolonged sitting can be reduced by fidgeting (periodic leg movement). An eight-week program of brisk walking resulted in a 50% increase in brachial artery FMD in middle-aged and older men, but failed to produce this benefit in estrogen-deficient post-menopausal women. Forty-five minutes of cycling exercise before sitting has been shown to eliminate the impaired leg FMD due to three hours of sitting. Athletes over age 40 show greater FMD than their age-matched peers. A meta-analysis of 182 subjects showed twice the improvement in FMD resulting from high-intensity interval training compared to endurance training. ==See also== * Atherosclerosis * Hypercholesterolemia ==References== Category:Medical diagnosis Category:Cardiovascular diseases ","title":"Flow-mediated dilation"},{"id":"56041889","text":"Since 1933, various traditional chiefs in Nyasaland have been designated as Native Authorities, initially by the colonial administration, and they numbered 105 in 1949. The Native Authorities were expected to act as the local government in areas of Native Trust Land administered for the benefit of their African populations, and to work in cooperation with the district officers as the local representatives of the colonial government. They represented a form of the Indirect rule which had become popular in British African dependencies in the second quarter of the 20th century, although Nyasaland's Native Authorities had fewer powers and smaller incomes than similar institutions in other African colonies. The Native Authority system worked reasonably effectively until after the Second World War, when they were obliged to enforce unpopular government agricultural policies and, in some cases, their support for the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland made Native Authorities unpopular with many of their people. After 1953, many of the powers of individual chiefs were transferred to councils which became the Native Authorities, although the chiefs sat on these councils. After independence, the authorities were renamed Traditional Authorities and continued to operate, and the status and influence of many of the chiefs revived through their cooperation with the Malawi government of Hastings Banda. There is an ongoing debate as to whether the Native Authorities' link with the colonial governments in the British African dependencies caused their authority to become weakened and for educated “new men” to emerge as community leaders, or whether the new status and administrative and judicial powers given to them by those administrations allowed chiefs to shake-off the pre-colonial restrictions on their powers and become more authoritarian and even despotic. Setting up a hierarchy of tribal paramount chiefs, subordinate chiefs and village headmen may also have served to fix previously less rigid “tribal” identities..McCracken (2012), pp. 215-217. ==Indirect rule before 1933== The first two colonial Commissioners to the British Central Africa Protectorate, Harry Johnstone and Alfred Sharpe, were unwilling to involve African chiefs in the governance of the protectorate or to accept their authority.Rotberg (1965), pp. 22-23. However, the poverty of the administration and the eagerness of many chiefs to secure official recognition led to the District Administration (Native) Ordinance, 1912, which allowed the governor to appoint Principal Headmen, who had only such authority and stipends as the residents (later district commissioners) for their district allowed them. Most Principal Headmen were prominent local chiefs, although in some cases preference was given to mission-educated candidates rather than those with a greater hereditary claim to chiefly status.McCracken (2012), p. 72. Each Principal Headman was made responsible for a number of Village Headmen, although it was made clear that the arrangement was not intended to foster or perpetuate rule by chiefs.Rotberg (1965), pp. 48–49. Amendments to the 1912 Ordinance in 1924 and 1929 extended the powers of the Principal Headmen to hear civil cases under customary law, collect hut taxes and issue certain licences.Malawi Law Commission (2012), p. 1. The governor of Nyasaland between 1924 and 1929 Sir Charles Bowring was an enthusiastic advocate of conscripting forced labour to work on European tobacco farms or on public works for minimal wages. He sought Colonial Office approval to extend its use to unpaid work on road building projects, which would involve taking workers far from their homes.McCracken (2012), p. 221. This was similar to the proposed use of forced labour in Kenya where the governor Sir Edward Northey had in 1919 instructed government officials to coerce African labour to work on European-owned farms and estates, despite earlier Colonial Office objections. After the scandal of Northey' proposal, the Colonial Office made clear it that any compulsory labour by local Africans must be paid; it could only be used on government projects if absolutely necessary and then only with Colonial Office approval.Okia (2008), pp. 263-264, 288. Bowring had held senior positions in Kenya between 1901 and 1924, and the Colonial Secretary, Leo Amery, who wanted to avoid a repeat of the Northey scandal, vetoed his proposal and, in 1928, instructed Bowring to consider the introduction of a form of Indirect rule in Nyasaland, appointing chiefs as Native Authorities. Bowring resisted on the basis that he thought Nyasaland’s tribal organisation was disintegrating, and his tour of duty was cut short in May 1929 as a result of his opposition. His successor, Shenton Thomas, who was governor from 1929 to 1932, enthusiastically promoted Indirect rule, instructing administrative officers that chiefly authority must be strengthened where it existed and restored where it no longer existed.McCracken (2012), pp. 221-222. ==Creation of Native Authorities== Although Thomas’s intention was to introduce Indirect rule on the basis proposed by Lord Lugard,Rotberg (1965), p. 50. he was first prevented by the economic effects of the Great Depression and later promoted to the post of governor of the Gold Coast, so it was left to his successor Sir Hubert Young, governor from 1932 to 1934, to introduce a diluted version of Thomas’s proposals. This was stated to be a form of local government in response to settler opposition to full-scale Indirect rule. Under Young’s legislation, in contradiction to Lugard’s principles, the Native Authorities had no financial responsibilities and Native Courts had no jurisdiction over European-owned estates. Only in 1940 were Native Authorities given a nominal role in tax collectionMcCracken (2012), pp. 222-223.Rotberg (1965), p. 50. The selection of Native Authorities created a number of difficulties, although the aim was to base them on local history and tradition.Power (2010), p. 30. Generally speaking, those individuals who had been designated Principal Headmen under legislation of 1912 became Native Authorities, although in some cases educated Principal Headmen appointed by colonial officials were supplanted by traditional chiefs, where local people emphasised their legitimacy. In addition, the aspirations of the Ngoni people of northern Nyasaland for the restoration of the son of their last paramount chief were largely satisfied when he was restored and allowed to revive the title of Mbelwa, although existing Principal Headmen were retained as his subordinate chiefs.McCracken (2012), p. 223.Power (2010), p. 33. A similar arrangement was made the Ngoni of southern Nyasaland, where the descendant of the last paramount was elevated from Principal Headman to paramount, with the revived title Gomani.McCracken (2012), p. 223. A number of groups such as the Tonga people had no tradition of chiefs and elsewhere the military and political upheavals of the 19th century had resulted in there being no uncontested legitimate candidates, or situations where the existing Principal Headmen were ethically different from their people. In the lower Shire River valley, which until the mid-19th century had been populated entirely by Mang'anja people, in the northern part, some of these Principal Headmen were from the Kololo people that David Livingstone brought from Botswana in 1862 as porters for his Zambezi expedition who had driven out Mang'anja chiefs, whereas, in the southern part, Mang'anja chiefs survived as Principal Headmen, but the local population consisted of Sena people, recent migrants from Mozambique. Even among the Mang'anja headmen, there were competing claims to legitimacy.McCracken (2012), p. 224. ==Locations== Native Authorities were located in the areas of Native Trust Land that had been created in 1916. In the early 20th century, the view among British government lawyers in the Foreign Office was that the act of declaring a protectorate over a territory gave Crown the right to dispose of land there. An Order-in-Council for government of the British Central Africa Protectorate of 1902 vested all rights to Crown lands, empowering him to dispose of any such land. Ng'ong'ola (1990), pp. 30–31. In 1904, Alfred Sharpe, who was Commissioner from 1896 to 1907, received powers to create reserve out of Crown Land under the Native Locations Ordinance. By 1913, the Native Reserves covered 6.6 million acres out the 22.3 million acres of land in the protectorate, and a further 2.6 million acres of Crown Land were designated to become future reserves.Pachai (1973), p. 685. A Land Registration Ordinance in 1916 recognised the Native Reserves as Native Trust Land, to be held in trust for the benefit of their African communities. This legislation did not provide for the administration of Trust Land by those African communities or their leaders, as formal Indirect rule was only introduced in 1933-34, although, in practice, chiefs had day-to-day charge of land distribution.Power (1992), p. 330. However, once the Native Authorities were instituted, they took over formal control of most of this land. ==Functions== Compared with Northern Nigeria, where Lugard has pioneered Indirect rule, or even Tanganyika Territory to the north, Nyasaland’s Native Authorities were significantly underfunded. They were entitled to two pence in every six shillings of Hut tax raised, although this was a much greater rate than Principal Headmen had previously received. In addition, Native Authorities could levy a range of fees and receive rents from leases of Native Trust Land, a valuable source of extra income where European farmers wished to grow tobacco. However, outside the tobacco-growing districts, overall Native Authority revenues were small: all of those in the Southern Province had a combined income of only £880 in 1935. This gave the Native Authorities very little scope for promoting social development, although some attempted to provide primary education, dispensaries, produce markets or rural roads.McCracken (2012), p. 225. However, the first Post-War Five-Year development plan placed significant emphasis on primary education and lead to the foundation of a number of Native Authority schools as alternatives to the dominance of mission schools in rural areas.Lamba (2010), p. 26. This was continued up in the second development plan, starting in 1950, but the government only allowed such schools in selected Native Authority areas where the chiefs were government supporters.Lamba (2010), p. 33. The parallel Native Courts Ordinance, 1933 established Native Courts administering customary law. This replaced the direct judicial powers of the chiefs, although they retained an involvement in the process as advisors and assessors.Malawi Law Commission (2012), p. 1. The Native Courts were cautious in using their powers under the 1933 Ordinance in criminal cases at first, generally fining offenders or ordering them to pay compensation to their victims. From the late 1940s, they were more willing to use imprisonment or, in a few cases, floggings, when prompted by government officers in cases where government agricultural regulations were flouted. However, from the start, they were much used for civil cases, mainly matrimonial issues.Hailey (1950), pp. 28-29.McCracken (2012), pp. 225-226. ==Post-war decline== Until the mid-1940s, the Native Authority scheme was generally accepted by the people living under its operation, and a number of chiefs were seen as modernisers within the limits of their role. However, in the post-Second World War period, a time of political and economic change, the Native Authorities were seen increasingly as imposing unpopular government-mandated soil conservation measures on their people.Kalinga (1996), pp. 448-449. Although a few chiefs openly opposed these schemes, most gave at least minimal cooperation to avoid being deposed by the government, but tried not to lose support and legitimacy by excessive enthusiasm for the measures.Power (2010), p. 30. By the early 1950s, Indirect rule was barely operating in many Native Authority areas and the political initiative had passed to the Nyasaland African Congress.Kalinga (1996), p. 449.McCracken (2012), p. 230. Although governors up Richards, in post 1942-47, supported the Native Authority scheme, Arthur Creech Jones, who became Colonial Secretary in 1946, called on all governors in African colonies to develop a more democratic systems of local government and involve educated men in decision making. The next governor, Colby set up a system of advisory councils in which government appointees would advise each Native Authority, and higher-level councils for each district and province. The treasuries of individual Native Authorities were also, from 1949, to be grouped in an attempt at greater efficiency, but these were reforms were insufficient to reverse the decline in the system.Cammack, Kanyongolo and O’Neil (2009), p. 3. The 1933 Native Authority Ordinance was replaced by the Native Authority Ordinance of 1946 and then by the Native Authority Ordinance of 1955. Under the 1955 Ordinance, a Native Authority was defined as any chief or other African or any council or group appointed to be a Native Authority for a particular area.McCracken (2012), pp. 270-271. In the early Post-War period, a number of Native Authorities employed salaried employees, who replaced the role of the traditional advisors to the chief concerned, and tended to take over hos role.Mair (1951), p. 78. As a result, under legislation introduced in 1953, most of the powers formerly held by individual chiefs were transferred to councils of which they were members and, usually, chairmen, and which included salaried employees.Malawi Law Commission (2012), pp. 1-2. ==After independence== After independence as Malawi in 1963, the Malawian government halted the decline of chiefly status in the Chiefs Act, 1967. This provided for the recognition and appointment of Paramount Chiefs, Senior Chiefs, Chiefs, Sub-Chiefs, Councillors and Village Headmen as Traditional Authorities who would perform their functions of preserving peace and developing their communities according to customary law. Under the presidency of Hastings Banda, the chiefs statutory status and their ability to allocate land and development resources made them an essential part of the state apparatus.Cammack, Kanyongolo and O’Neil (2009), pp. 5-6.Malawi Law Commission (2012), pp. 2-3. Following the restoration of multi-party politics in 1993 and the devolution of many previously-centralised powers to district councils in 1998, the chiefs who are Traditional Authorities became ex-officio members of the district councils still have a role in local government, although their control over land allocation and membership of Traditional Courts has ended.Cammack, Kanyongolo and O’Neil (2009), pp. 7-8. == References Sources== *D Cammack, E.

Sharkey, the founder of iVillage and the former CEO of BabyCenter, had a background in online communities, and Leffler, the founder of several companies, including Yes To, Inc. and Yoobi, had experience in consumer products. In mid-2016, Sharkey resigned from her position as CEO of Sherpa Foundry to become CEO of Brandless, with Leffler serving as its chairman. The company raised $16 million in funding led by Redpoint Ventures in November 2016, and at launch had received a total of $50 million in venture capital from New Enterprise Associates, Google Ventures, and others. In 2018, the company launched a pop-up store in Los Angeles in May. Brandless launched a second, larger pop-up store in New York in October 2018. In May 2019, Brandless raised $240 million as a part of its series C funding round. Soon after, Tina Sharkey stepped down as CEO after friction between her and lead investor SoftBank Vision. In February 2020, Brandless announced that it would cease operations, citing fierce competition and business model inviability in the direct-to-consumer market. The business laid off 70 staff members (about 90% of the operation at the time), with the remaining employees managing open orders. In June 2020, the business relaunched in a more limited form, led by Ryan Treft and a small team. Treft bidded for the business with a \\"more pragmatic\\" vision. ==Business model== Brandless was based in San Francisco, California, and operated an additional facility in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It marketed its foods as GMO-free, its health and beauty items as cruelty-free, and paper products as adhering to sustainable forestry practices. Products' labels consist of only a white box with the product's name and two to five descriptors, such as organic, kosher, or gluten-free. Brandless is a brand of its own. The company operated a direct-to-consumer model which it promoted as reducing markups compared to conventional brand-name items. Initially, Brandless priced single items at $3, or multiple items for $3 total. That policy changed in January 2019 and higher-priced products were offered. In 2019, Brandless began to offer an optional subscription service to its customers. ==Awards and recognition== In February 2018, Brandless received the Best NewCo of the Year award from NewCo Honors for disrupting retail markets and donating 250,000 meals to Feeding America. Additionally, it was awarded \\"StartUp of the Year\\" by AdAge, one of \\"The World' Most Innovative Companies in Retail\\" by Fast Company. ==See also== *No Name ==References *Official Website Category:Companies based in San Francisco Category:2016 establishments in California Category:2020 disestablishments in California Category:American companies established in 2016 Category:Defunct companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Grocers Category:GV companies Category:Internet properties established in 2016 Category:Internet properties disestablished in 2020 Category:Online retailers of the United States Category:Retail companies established in 2016 Category:Retail companies disestablished in 2020 Category:Privately held companies based in California Category:Retail companies established in 2020 ","title":"Brandless"},{"id":"56042286","text":"Kemiyondo Coutinho is a Ugandan playwright, actress and filmmaker based in Los Angeles.

The mean annual precipitation is low (350-400mm), mostly coming from snow. AT the same time, the area is favorable for cultivation due to springs based on water-bearing strata and karst waters, and rivers coming from the mountains and converging into the Euphrates.

Nikolayev has divided loyalties: on the one hand he has to arrest punks like Crash, while on the other he has to pick up his daughter from the police department where she, along with other representatives of youth subculture, has been brought in for public order violations. The conflict between father and daughter is set against the backdrop of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when even schoolteachers cannot explain to their students why what they say changes every day. Crash's wild life, which includes staying out all night and self- harm, culminates in a gang rape by a group of rich young men. This tragedy brings father and daughter closer together. Nikolayev subsequently sets out to take revenge on the perpetrators, defying the law which he has spent his life defending. The thugs die in a car accident.

It is now a horse farm. ==History== The house was first built for Logan Henderson and his wife, Margaret Ewart Johnston, in 1816, and extended in 1842. The Johnsons grew cotton and corn; they also raised cattle and swine. They owned 21 slaves in 1820 and 50 slaves in 1840. Upon marrying William F. Lytle, the Hendersons's daughter, Violet, inherited 5 slaves. In 1846, the property was inherited by the Hendersons's son, James Franklin Henderson, who lived there with his wife Amanda and their nine children. James Franklin Henderson was a Whig, which explains why the house was not destroyed during the American Civil War of 1861–1865. The Hendersons invited both Mrs Braxton Bragg and Mrs William Starke Rosecrans, the spouses of Confederate and Union generals. The house was purchased by Henry Pfeil in 1897. When his daughter married William A. Snell, the couple turned it into a dairy farm. In 1966, it was acquired by Price Harrison, who raised Angus cattle.

Nagatsuma has been elected almost continuously since 2000, save for the 2005 Koizumi landslide where he was only returned through the proportional representation block. Nagatsuma regained the district in the 2009 landslide that brought the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) into power. Despite facing strong headwinds in the 2012 and 2014 LDP landslide, he managed to hold on to his seat. He was the only opposition lawmaker winning a single-seat constituency in Tokyo in the 2014 election. Nagatsuma retained his seat in the 2017 election that was preceded by a split in the Democratic Party (DP). Nagatsuma along with liberal-leaning members of the DP like Yukio Edano and Hirotaka Akamatsu founded the CDP. He was challenged in the election by his regular LDP rival Fumiaki Matsumoto. The party housing conservative former DP members, Kibō no Tō also fielded a candidate. Akihiro Araki, the husband of Tomin First no Kai leader Chiharu Araki, was chosen to contest the seat for Kibō.

He was 22nd of the 24 children of inventor and industrialist Isaac Singer of Singer Sewing Machine Company fame, from whom he inherited money; he has been described as a \\"man of luxury\\". Born in Paris, he married Cecilia Henrietta Augusta (\\"Lillie\\") Graham (b. Perth Australia, 6 June 1867; d. Paignton, 7 March 1951), who bore him five children. He had a tempestuous romance with famous dancer Isadora Duncan, whose career he helped, and with whom he had another son, Patrick (born 1910, drowned 1913). Singer Island, Florida, is named for him. In 1917 Singer met the future Palm Beach architect Addison Mizner; they became \\"inseparable.\\" It was through Singer's influence that Mizner arrived in Palm Beach on January 5, 1918, in part for his health; he was Singer's house guest (at 123 Peruvian Avenue). Mizner's first Florida project was transforming Singer's unimpressive \\"villa\\" into the Chinese Villa, in which Singer lived until the Everglades Club was completed in 1919. Mizner said of Singer in 1917: > [He was] the cause of my existence for the next ten tears. He was the > finest-looking man I ever saw; six feet, three or four, straight as a die, > with a fine figure. At this time, he was fifty and looked forty. He wrote later: > Paris was a strange, silent man, who loved to look on but hard to talk to > unless you got him on his own subjects. At this time it was hospital work. Singer had built a string of hospitals in England and France \\"for the war- wounded\\" (in the First World War). At the urging of Lady Randolph Churchill, he donated the use of his house at Oldway in Paignton to be used by the American Women's War Relief Fund as a military hospital. Deciding to build one in Palm Beach, after consulting with Mizner, he bought a large parcel of land on which the \\"Touchstone Convalescent Club\\" was to be built. He hired Mizner to build it, and Mizner moved to Palm Beach. Mizner purchased from him the \\"virtually inoperable pottery factory, 'Las Manos' ['The Hands']\\". Paris Singer was the president of the Everglades Club, as the convalescent home soon became (the war had ended), and lived there in an apartment constructed for him. He planned on what became Singer Island a hotel, the Blue Heron, designed by Mizner, to be the most luxurious ever built, as part of a large new resort. An \\"aerial ferry\\" would connect it to the mainland, with 12 cable cars 136 feet above the water, since West Palm Beach refused to permit a bridge. It was the largest building Mizner ever designed. Because of the Florida real estate collapse of 1926 and its effects on Singer, the hotel was not completed. It was known as \\"Singer's Folly\\" until razed in 1940. The real estate collapse also contributed to the end of Singer's close friendship with Mizner, which ended in 1927. The Everglades Club went into receivership, as Singer was unable to service the loans for which the club was collateral. He was arrested in April, 1928, at the Everglades Club, on charges of real estate fraud. A judge dismissed the charges three weeks later, but Singer, having been publicly humiliated, left Palm Beach immediately and never lived there again. The stock market crash of 1929 further depleted his funds, and he spent his final years quietly with his wife and former nurse Joan Balsh in his Moorish house (since demolished) in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, France. He died in London. ==References== Category:1867 births Category:1932 deaths Category:Addison Mizner Category:American manufacturing businesspeople Category:American patrons of the arts Category:American real estate businesspeople Category:French emigrants to the United States Category:Palm Beach, Florida Category:People from Palm Beach, Florida Category:People from Paris Category:People with acquired American citizenship Category:People charged with crimes ","title":"Paris Singer"},{"id":"56042516","text":"Fyodor Pavlov-Andreevich (Russian: Фёдор Бори́сович Па́влов-Андрее́вич, April 14, 1976) is a Russo-Brazilian artist, curator, and theater director. == Early life and education == Pavlov-Andreevich was born in Moscow to film historian Boris Pavlov and writer Ludmilla Petrushevskaya. He is the great-grandson of the linguist Nikolay Yakovlev, and the great-great-grandson of the revolutionary Ilya Weger. He graduated with MA in European literature from Moscow State University's department of journalism in 1999. In Russia, Pavlov- Andreevich became famous in the 1990s as a young print and television journalist/presenter. At the end of the 1990s, he began to work on producing projects in contemporary culture. From the 2000s onward, he has worked as a theater director, performance artist, and director of the Solyanka State Gallery in Moscow. He lives in Moscow, São Paulo, and London. == Career == In 2002, Pavlov-Andreevich made his theatrical debut with 'BiFem', based on the play by Ludmilla Petrushevskaya. In 2003, the play received the New Word ('Novoe slovo') award at the New Drama ('Novaya drama') Festival. Among his other theatrical works are 'Old Women' ('Staroukhy'), a thirty-minute experimental opera based on the Daniil Kharms story that was nominated for two Golden Mask awards in 2010; and 'Andante', a 'dramatic dance' production based on another play by Petrushevskaya, first performed at the Meyerhold Centre in 2016. Since the end of the 2000s, Pavlov-Andreevich has worked in the field of contemporary art. He has collaborated with Marina Abramovich, Serpentine Gallery director Hans-Ulrich Obrist, and MOCA LA director Klaus Biesenbach, and Performa Biennale founder and director RoseLee Goldberg. Marina Abramovic once said on Pavlov-Andreevich’s practice: \\"His art is capable of surprising us with ever new ways of seeing the world we live in.\\" Pavlov-Andreevich's solo presentations have been shown at the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art (Moscow), the Künstlerhaus (Vienna), Faena Arts Center (Buenos Aires), the CCBB Cultural Center (Brasilia), Deitch Projects (New York City), ICA (Institute of Contemporary Arts, London), MAC USP Museum and SESC Cultural Center (both São Paulo), among the others. Pavlov-Andreevich earned international recognition thanks to one of his guerrilla performances, 'The Foundling', in which a nude Pavlov-Andreevich, encased in a glass box, was literally thrown into a series of society events without their organizers' permission. Among them were the gala opening of the new building of the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Moscow, a dinner by French patron François Pinault at the Venice Biennale, and the Met Gala in New York. During the performance at the Met Gala on May 2, 2017, he was arrested by New York City police for trespassing on private property and public nudity, then sent to Central Booking prison, where he spent 24 hours. His series of performances, Temporary Monuments (2014–2017), along with solo shows by the same name at Moscow's Pechersky Gallery (2016) and the Museum of Contemporary Art at the University of São Paulo (2017), was dedicated to the problem of contemporary slavery in Brazil and Russia. In each of the seven performances in the series, the artist immersed himself in the conditions which slaves were (or are) forced to endure. In one of them (Pau de Arara), he submits himself to a type of medieval torture still used by the Brazilian police's special forces; in another (O Tigre), he performs a Brazilian slave ritualistic punishment, in which a person must cross Rio de Janeiro while carrying a basket of sewage on their head Pavlov-Andreevich's artistic practice focuses on three subjects: the distance between the spectator and the work of art in performance, the temporality and vulnerability of the human body, and the connection between the sacred and the obscene.

His dissertation remains the only known work to have done this in the discipline of philosophy. In 2008-2009, Curry was a post-doctoral fellow at Penn State University in the Africana Research Center.https://arc.la.psu.edu/history/who-we-are/post-doctoral- fellows/2008-2009-fellows/tommy-curry-ph-d His main research areas include critical race theory, Black Male Studies, and Africana philosophy. ==Writing== Curry is the author of The Man-Not: Race, Class, Genre, and the Dilemmas of Black Manhood. In academic circles, The Man-Not is regarded as controversial for its discussion of the rape of Black males during slavery by white men and women, its depiction of white feminism as the perfection of patriarchy and American imperialism, and the text's documenting of the rape and domestic abuse Black males suffer at the hands of Black men and women in their communities. However, The Man-Not has received multiple positive reviews in Masculinity Studies, Black Studies, and Gender Studies journals. In August 2018, the Before Columbus Foundation announced that The Man-Not would be awarded a 2018 American Book Award for its original contribution to American literature and thought.http://www.beforecolumbusfoundation.com/wp- content/uploads/2018/08/ABA-press-release-2018.pdf Curry's book argues for the creation of a new field of study looking at the experiences and historical development of racialized men and boys the world over. In 2018, Temple University Press made Curry editor of the Black Male Studies series which Curry has claimed is the first book series specifically dedicated to the study of Black men and boys and racialized males to ever be supported on a University Press. Much of Curry's writing is based on combining social science research with philosophy and theory. He claims that many of the theories offered to explain the lives of Black Americans are not only incorrect but relies on outdated racist modes of thinking. As a scholar of Critical Race Theory, Curry's work focuses on the theories developed by racial realists like Derrick Bell, Richard Delgado, Jean Stefancic, and Kenneth Nunn. He argues that idealist strands of CRT are unable to account for the brutal realities of Black death and dying, poverty, and de facto segregation. ==2017 Controversy== In 2017, Curry was targeted by conservatives and white nationalists for previous statements he had made comparing revolutionary violence and armed self-defense in the United States in a podcast analyzing Jamie Foxx's lead character in Django. Snopes and news sources have vindicated Curry, noting that his words and research had been taken out of context. Curry's name appeared in national publications as a symbol of academic freedom garnering support and drawing attention to the risks Black professors take on in their discussion of race and racism in American universities. ==Awards== In addition to the American Book Award, Curry has received several academic awards and honors for his research. In 2017, Curry was awarded the Alain Locke Award by the Society of American Philosophy for his public intellectual research and commentaries on anti-Black racism, the death and dying of Black males, and the rape of Black men and boys in the United States. His publications and national profile earned him recognition as one of the Top 15 Emerging Scholars of Color in the United States by Diverse Magazine in 2018. In 2020, his second monograph, Another white Man's Burden: Josiah Royce's Quest for a Philosophy of white Racial Empire, won the Josiah Royce Prize in American Idealist Thought from the Josiah Royce Society. ==Works== * The Man-Not : Race, Class, Genre, and the Dilemmas of Black Manhood, Philadelphia, Pa. : Temple University Press, 2017. , * Another white Man's Burden: Josiah Royce's Quest for a Philosophy of white Racial Empire, Albany, NY: SUNY Press, 2018 , ==References== Category:Texas A&M; University faculty Category:Southern Illinois University alumni Category:African-American philosophers Category:DePaul University alumni Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Tommy Curry (professor)"},{"id":"56042545","text":"Kristek House () is a building on the corner of Tišnovská and Trávníky Streets in Brno, Czech Republic that was transformed into a monumental assemblage by the Czech sculptor, painter and action artist Lubo Kristek.

The film is based on the life of Miguel Joaquín Eleizegui Arteaga (1818-1861) who suffered from gigantism and was known as the \\"Giant from Altzo\\". The film premiered at the 2017 San Sebastián International Film Festival, where it was awarded the Special Jury Prize. The film was also screened at the 2017 BFI London Film Festival. At the 32nd Goya Awards, the film won ten awards, including Best Original Screenplay, Best New Actor (Eneko Sagardoy), and Best Original Score (Pascal Gaigne). ==Cast== *Joseba Usabiaga as Joaquin *Eneko Sagardoy as Martin *Iñigo Aranburu as Arzadun *Ramon Agirre as Antonio *Aia Kruse as María ==Plot== Martin Eleizegi is an unwilling conscript in the First Carlist War. While fighting, he is injured and loses the use of his right arm. He returns to his family's small farm in the village of Altzo in the Basque Country, where he discovers his younger brother, Joaquin, has grown into a giant. Martin, longing to emigrate to America, sees the commercial opportunity in marketing the \\"tallest man on Earth.\\" The brothers travel around Europe, despite Joaquin's increasing discomfort of being a freak attraction. Joaquin measures himself each night and is horrified that he continues to grow well into his twenties, and suffers from increasing aches and pains. He suspects that the condition is terminal. Martin attempts to appear more sophisticated by learning Spanish and wearing modern fashions. He briefly believes he blends in, yet his background and Basque accent betray him. Embittered, he and Joaquin travel abroad through Spain, France and England. The brothers eventually visit Stonehenge where, in a surreal, early morning ritual, Joaquin is introduced to two other giants: Saad and Esther.Holland, Jonathan. \\"'Giant' ('Handia'): Film Review\\". Hollywoodreporter.com, 2018. Retrieved 13 May 2018 In Paris, Joaquin's pain intensifies. He is taken to a doctor, who formally diagnoses Joaquin with gigantism. The doctor asks if Joaquin would sell his bones to science after he passes away. Joaquin replies that he wants to be buried in Altzo. Joaquin and Esther meet up for a romantic encounter. She shows interest, but he is too self-conscious and possibly impotent, due his condition. Their night ends with Esther upset and confused as Joaquin angrily sends her away. When the brothers briefly return home, Martin marries Maria, whom Joaquin courted before he grew to an unusual height. Martin and Joaquin continue to tour, with the intention of using Joaquin's wages to secure ownership of the family farm. Joaquin, suspicious of being exploited, secretly hoards them. When their carriage is robbed by highwaymen, all of Joaquin's money is stolen. To prevent losing the farm, Martin gives up his own earnings, which he had planned to use to move to America. In an attempt to recoup their losses, the brothers continue to tour. However, Joaquin's physical health deteriorates and their audiences dwindle. One day, Joaquin is chased into the woods by a wolf and nearly freezes to death. When the brothers reunite, Martin recognizes Joaquin's undying loyalty and they return home for good. Joaquin dies from his medical condition and is buried in Altzo. He leaves a surprising amount of money to Martin, though the source of it is unclear. Years later, after Martin's father dies, he digs up Joaquin's grave to make room in the family cemetery. He discovers the grave is empty and realizes the money likely came from the selling of Joaquin's bones. Martin reflects on how all physical traces of Joaquin are slowly disappearing, but he won't forget his brother. ==Critical reception== The film won several Goya awards in Spain and has been described as the most technically accomplished to date Basque-language movie. English language critics have been equally enthusiastic, praising especially its visual brilliance while noting that the plot loses momentum towards the end. , Giant holds a 70% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on ten reviews with an average rating of 6.5 out of 10. == Awards == { class= - !

The daughter of George Villiers, 4th Earl of Jersey, and his wife Frances, Caroline was married, on 5 July 1795, in London, to Lord Paget, who at that time was MP for Carnarvon.

Her second marriage, to the Duke of Argyll, took place at Canongate, Edinburgh, only three weeks later. It was the duke's only marriage, and there were no children.

Located in the Ochs' family auto supply business in North Vernon, the station was started with the intent of keeping the local community informed and entertained, while broadcasting Christian programming. Eventually, the station was bought ARS Broadcasting Corporation and carried a Middle of the Radio (MOR) format. At the time, the station carried the WNVI callsign. WNVI changed its callsign to WKRP on August 17, 1989 and back to WNVI on August 8, 1997. Findlay Publishing Company purchased WNVI and its then FM sister-stations WRBI and WWWY for $1.9 million in 1997. For a time, after the sale, WNVI carried a Talk format, simulcasting then sister-station WCSI. Findlay Publishing Company sold WNVI, in a swap for WWWY, to Pieratt Communications, Inc. on November 20, 2001. With the sale, the simulcast was WCSI ended and WNVI switched to Adult Standards. In 2003, the station flipped to ESPN Radio-affiliated sports branded as \\"ESPN 1460\\". On May 15, 2006, WNVI became WJCP with its callsign standing for Jennings County Panthers, the latter derived from the county high school's mascot. WJCP was sold to its current owners, Tom and Diana Taylor, on October 17, 2014. WJCP added FM translator W249DG, broadcasting on 97.7 FM, on May 9, 2016.

It is a joint project between Aera Energy and GlassPoint Solar. It will be the first in the world to incorporate solar steam generation with solar electricity generation. These technologies will be leveraged to reduce costs for the traditional oil and gas company while at the same time reducing emitted carbon and increasing local air quality. The Belridge Oil Field resides near Bakersfield, California. The facility was first announced in November 2017. == Technology == EOR includes a process for injecting steam deep into an oil reservoir. The steam heats the oil, which loosens it to be more easily pumped to the surface. Commonly, liquefied natural gas is burned to heat water in order to generate that steam. With solar EOR, however, solar thermal energy is harnessed via a parabolic trough enclosed in a greenhouse to create steam. == Impact == Once completed, the facility is projected to produce 12 million barrels of steam annually through a 850MW thermal solar steam generator. It is planned to reduce the natural gas used at the Belridge Oil Field for the production and extraction of heavy oil in its enhanced oil recovery process (EOR). Additionally, a separate 26.5 MW electricity generating facility using photovoltaic panels is planned to power oilfield operations. The new facility is predicted to reduce carbon emissions by more than 376,000 metric tons annually. This will offset more than one-third of all the cars driven in Bakersfield. It is also expected to create hundreds of jobs throughout California. This project highlights a growing trend of oil and gas companies partnering with the solar energy industry. ==References== Category:Oil fields in California ","title":"Belridge Solar"},{"id":"56043331","text":"Baldev Singh was an Indian athlete.

Tuft married in 1971 and while raising a family studied art at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn from 1981 to 1989. ==Career== Unseen and other work (1998-2011) Tuft began her work in 1998 with images of snow and ice in Aspen, Colorado. There she first experimented with infrared film, where the photos could capture the infrared light waves that were reflected and refracted on the landscape, which are beyond the human visible spectrum. These photographs would become platinum prints, and resulted in her first solo exhibition, Distillations, at Hollis Taggart Galleries in New York City in 1999. She continued to photograph outside the visible spectrum, focusing on the visual effects of ultraviolet light waves on the Earth's landscape. Tuft began traveling to ozone-depleted areas where larger amounts of ultraviolet light reach the Earth. This led to an interest in climate change and other environmental issues.\\"Photographer Illustrates a 'Disappearing Landscape',\\" Wall Street Journal, April 13, 2017.

Lawrence and his wife Frieda are living a shaky relationship with the overpowering Frieda missing her children, whom she abandoned for the writer, and fighting with Lawrence. The local coastguards, also suspect that Frieda, a cousin of Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron air ace, is a German spy and is sending signals from the cliffs to U-boats in the channel. In these turbulent times, the Lawrences invite their best, and by now almost only remaining friends, the critic and editor John Middleton Murry and the short-story writer Katherine Mansfield to come and join them in the cottage. For Lawrence, this was a step on the road to his ideal of Rananim – a utopia where one could be happy with a group of friends. As things develop, Lawrence and Frieda engage in violent fights followed by love-making sessions on the floor. Lawrence suggests that Murry becomes his blood brother, while Mansfield has writer's block, a situation Rosenthal passed through for six years before writing this play. Mansfield, after an enforced intimacy with Frieda, puts an end to the social experiment, leaving Lawrence with a permanent sense of betrayal. ==Cast== *Ed Stoppard as DH Lawrence *Tracy-Ann Oberman as Frieda Lawrence, D.H.

They first appeared in the late Triassic and survived at least as late as the Paleocene. While most rhynchocephalians, such as the modern tuatara, were carnivores or insectivores, opisthodonts were herbivorous. Advanced opisthodonts of the subfamily Eilenodontinae were among the largest rhynchocephalians known. Opisthodontia is defined as all rhynchocephalians closer to Priosphenodon than to Sphenodon (tuatara). == Description ==  Teeth and diet  Like other sphenodonts, opisthodonts had acrodont teeth which grew directly from the bone. They had one row of teeth on the lower jaw and two rows on the roof of the mouth. When processing food, their mandibular teeth would have slid between the outer (maxillary) teeth and inner (palatine) teeth. Some opisthodonts, such as Sphenotitan, also had clusters of small teeth on the pterygoid at the center of the mouth roof. Opisthodont teeth were wide, numerous, and tightly-packed for grinding and shredding tough plant matter. Although wide shredding teeth are also known in a few other sphenodontians, such as Clevosaurus and Pelecymala, the most diverse and long- lasting group of herbivorous rhynchocephalians were the opisthodonts. Some more generalized opisthodonts, such as Opisthias, were probably more capable of omnivory than the advanced eilenodonts. The mandibular teeth of opisthodonts were characteristically edged with forward-pointing flanges. Although Sphenotitan only had flanges on the medial (inside) edge, other eilenodonts had flanges on the lateral (outside) edge as well, making their teeth anteriorly concave and overlapping. The maxillary teeth, on the other hand, had long flanges aligned in a posteromedial-anterolateral direction. Opisthodonts lacked dental regionalization, meaning that all of their teeth had the same form and they did not have caniform or hatchling teeth like other sphenodonts. Despite having had thicker enamel to resist wearing down their teeth, opisthodonts have often been found with their teeth significantly worn away, especially towards the front of the jaw. The tip of the lower jaw is completely toothless in opisthodonts. Their jaws were also deep (particularly in eilenodonts) to counter stresses which would have occurred during food processing. Lower jaws of Sphenodon and several opisthodonts.  Characteristic features  Opisthodonts can be characterized by the following synapomorphies: * A rounded and well-developed mandibular symphysis. * A well- developed, antedorsally projecting mandibular spur. * No dental regionalization in adults or juveniles. * Extensive posteromedial/anterolateral flanges on the posterior maxillary teeth. * Anteromedial flanges on the mandibular teeth. * A short or absent premaxillary process of the maxilla. * The posterodorsal process of the premaxilla being present. In addition, most opisthodonts also had dental ridges (or crests) on their mandibular teeth. The most advanced opisthodonts belong to the subfamily (or tribe) Eilenodontinae (or Eilenodontini). Most eilenodonts were large, stockily built members of the clade, with massive jaws, low and overlapping teeth, and a large hooked \\"beak\\"(a rhynchocephalian feature). Their skulls were reminiscent of rodent skulls, leading some to presume that they were gregarious burrowers which fed on tough vegetation. The largest known terrestrial rhynchocephalian was an eilenodont, Priosphenodon avelasi. == Classification == First defined as a family by Apesteguia and Novas in 2003, Opisthodontia has generally been considered a well-supported clade, especially compared to other groups within Rhynchocephalia, which often shift in evolutionary position between studies. In particular, they are generally considered to be fairly close relatives of the family Sphenodontidae, which includes Sphenodon. Both opisthodonts and sphenodontids share the ability to move their jaw in a forward-to-back chewing motion, earning them the informal name \\"eupropalinal sphenodonts\\" as a result. Other possibly herbivorous rhynchocephalians, such as Pelecymala and Ankylosphenodon, have sometimes been suggested to be very close relatives (or basal members) of Opisthodontia in some studies, although these hypotheses are not well supported. Ankylosphenodon is considered to be placed within Sphenodontidae, while Pelecymala is inconsistent in placement but may be a quite basal rhynchocephalian. \\"Clevosaurus\\" latidens, which had previously been referred to Pelecymala and later Clevosaurus, was suggested to be an opisthodont in 2013, a hypothesis which was confirmed through a 2015 phylogenetic analysis. This same analysis found that Opisthias and Kawasphenodon formed a clade at the base of Opisthodontia, with Sphenotitan being a basal eilenodont. In 2018, \\"Clevosaurus\\" latidens was named as the new genus Fraserosphenodon, and placed as the most basal opisthodont. == Distribution == Skulls of Priosphenodon individuals of various ages Opisthodonts were numerous at times, with Opisthias having a practically worldwide distribution in the Jurassic and Priosphenodon being known from multiple specimens from the early Cretaceous of Argentina. The oldest opisthodonts include Sphenotitan and Fraserosphenodon, from the Norian and Rhaetian (late Triassic) of Argentina and England, respectively. Fraserosphenodon is considered to be the most basal opisthodont. Although Sphenotitan was also once believed to be the most basal opisthodont, it also shows many similarities with eilenodonts, and may have been the most basal member of that subfamily. The oldest known non-Sphenotitan eilenodonts lived during the Jurassic and probably became extinct near the end of the Cretaceous. Opisthodonts as a whole survived a major extinction of Laurasian rhynchocephalians in the early Cretaceous as well as the K/T extinction at the end of the Cretaceous which led to the downfall of non-avian dinosaurs. The last known species of opisthodont was Kawasphenodon peligrensis, a small patagonian member of the group which lived during the Paleocene. The last of the opisthodonts probably became extinct due to the cooling climate of the late Eocene. ==References== .

Jinjer was originally formed in 2009 by Maksym Fatullaiev (vocals), Dmitriy Oksen (rhythm guitar), and Vyacheslav Okhrimenko (drums). However, the band considers 2010 as its official year of formation when Tatiana Shmailyuk replaced Fatullaiev on vocals and Roman Ibramkhalilov was picked up for the lead guitar. Since their inception, the band has released three full-length albums and three EPs. ==History== Inhale, Don't Breathe (2012-2013) The band was still trying to develop and cultivate their sound until bassist Eugene Abdukhanov joined in the summer of 2011. In 2012, Jinjer released their EP: Inhale, Do Not Breathe; the band's first recording with new singer Tatiana Shmailyuk and lead guitarists Roman Ibramkhalilov. The EP gained traction within the metal music community, and Jinjer began relentlessly touring throughout the year on their own funds. They were finally noticed by \\"The Leaders Records\\" at the end of 2012, and Jinjer's first full-length album, Inhale, Don't Breathe, was officially re-released in 2013; including three live versions. The band also gained prominence in part from winning the \\"Best Ukrainian Metal Act\\" award held by Kiev's InshaMuzyka label in 2013; they would go on to win the award again in 2016. Cloud Factory (2014) Jinjer was gaining more and more recognition after the release of their album Inhale, Don't Breathe. The band quickly wrote another album, self-releasing it in 2014 under the title Cloud Factory. This would later be picked up and released by their current record label, Napalm Records. Jinjer began touring internationally with the album. With the tour, for which they personally booked their own shows, they started to develop a larger fan base. The band's intensity and dedication from the album and tour caught the attention of their current label, Napalm Records. and Jinjer was quickly signed with the label with which they were set to release a new and third album. King of Everything (2016) After several tours around the world, Jinjer released their third full-length album, King of Everything, with Napalm Records in 2016 along with their single (and video) \\"Pisces\\". The album and single were pivotal points in Jinjer's musical career. The music video for the single has gone viral and spawned dozens of reaction videos on YouTube, largely due to Shmailyuk's sudden switches in singing style; the band themselves has expressed ambivalence about the popularity of the video. Along with winning the award for best music video for the song \\"I Speak Astronomy\\", the attention on the band paved the way for the release of King of Everything and the new single \\"Pisces\\" on 29 July 2016. In 2017, the band committed to two tours across Europe in support of Arch Enemy, followed by their first tour of North America alongside Cradle of Filth in 2018. The band also reissued their 2014 album Cloud Factory on Napalm Records in February 2018. Micro EP (2019) Due to Jinjer's dedication to their craft and strong work ethic, their popularity continued to snowball into 2019 as they released their new 5-track EP Micro on 11 January 2019, still with Napalm Records. The EP was successful, and fans quickly took to the tracks \\"Ape\\" and \\"Perennial\\". This EP showcased Tatiana Shmailyuk's impressive and unique vocal range as well as the band's ability to quickly evolve and tune their sound between albums. In early 2019 they toured with Amorphis, Soilwork, and Nailed to Obscurity. Macro (2019) Later in 2019, Jinjer followed up their EP Micro with their fourth full-length album, Macro, on 25 October 2019, still with Napalm Records.

It was released on June 1, 1988 through Pony Canyon as the album's leading single. The song was written by Miyuki Nakajima and composed and produced by Tsugutoshi Gotō. This collaboration with a respected singer-songwriter like Nakajima, as well as Kudo's overall shift in image, were seen as a catalyst for the end of the 1980s idol phenomenon, with Kudo's career path being regarded as the blueprint for the successful transition from idol to artist. ==Background== When Kudo's solo debut was in the works, she was asked by then-Pony Canyon music executive Yūzō Watanabe to choose which singer-songwriter, out of Yumi Matsutōya, Mariya Takeuchi and Miyuki Nakajima, she preferred. Kudo chose Nakajima, whom she was a big fan of. This story, which had been floated around at the time as a sort of urban legend of the music industry, actually took place and shortly thereafter Nakajima was writing songs for Kudo. \\"Fu-ji-tsu\\" marks the first collaboration between Nakajima and Tsugutoshi Gotō, who are often cited as the \\"golden duo\\" behind many of Kudo's hit singles. ==Composition== The song was written by Miyuki Nakajima and Tsugutoshi Gotō. It is composed in the key of B minor and set to a tempo of 136 beats per minute. Kudo's vocals span from A3 to B4. The title of the song, which loosely translates to \\"Untruth\\", was written in roman letters because Nakajima felt that the kanji for \\"fujitsu\\" (不実) was too heavy for the then-18-year-old Kudo to be singing about. Hyphens were added to the title in order for the song not be confused with the IT company Fujitsu. Lyrically, the song describes the feelings of two former lovers who pretend not to know each other, or tell \\"untruths\\", in the presence of their new respective significant others. ==Critical reception== Kudo received acclaim for her vocal performance. Her voice was cited as \\"well- matched\\" to the melancholy melody of the song. \\"Fu-ji-tsu\\" is considered by critics to be the song that established Kudo as Akina Nakamori's successor to the pop crown. Upon hearing Kudo perform her lyrics on the television show Uta no Top Ten for the first time, Nakajima phoned in during the show as special guest and described Kudo's delivery of her lyrics as \\"giving it a greater than life image unlike what I had initially imagined.\\" She added that, for that reason, she was glad to have offered the song to Kudo instead of keeping it for herself. ==Chart performance== \\"Fu-ji-tsu\\" debuted at number-one on the Oricon Singles Chart, with 60,000 copies sold, becoming Kudo's first number- one debut since \\"Kindan no Telepathy\\". The song was recognized by Oricon as the second best-selling single of June 1988, edged out from the top spot only by Akina Nakamori's \\"Tattoo\\". The single charted for a total of twenty weeks. It became the first of eight consecutive number-one songs on the Oricon Singles Chart for Kudo. ==Track listingCharts== style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" Chart (1988) !scope=\\"col\\" Peak position !scope=\\"col\\" Sales - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Weekly Singles (Oricon)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1  rowspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"253,000 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Monthly Singles (Oricon)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Yearly Singles (Oricon)  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"23 } ==See also== * List of Oricon number-one singles ==References== Category:1988 songs Category:1988 singles Category:Songs written by Miyuki Nakajima Category:Oricon Weekly number-one singles Category:Shizuka Kudo songs Category:Pony Canyon singles Category:Songs written by Tsugutoshi Gotō ","title":"Fu-ji-tsu"},{"id":"56043891","text":"The following is a list of awards and nominations received by English actor and writer Daniel Kaluuya.

After serving in the U.S Department of Justice as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York from 1993 to 2002, he entered private practice where he was involved in several prominent white-collar and antitrust cases in addition to a series of cases seeking governmental reform. He represents Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Russia's anti-doping laboratory. At one time Walden represented former UFC Lightweight champion Conor McGregor in McGregor's pending court case for felony criminal mischief and misdemeanor assault in Brooklyn, NY. Walden has represented plaintiffs in class action lawsuits suits against the New York City Department of Education and the New York City Housing Authority. He served as Special Counsel to a task force created by the Governor of New Jersey to investigate the administration of the state’s tax incentive programs. == Early life and education == Walden received his B.A. from Hamilton College. He graduated magna cum laude from Temple University School of Law in 1991 where he was first in his class. == Law career == Following law school, Walden clerked for Anthony J. Scirica in the U.S Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Walden then joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. He served in this capacity for nearly nine years before turning to private practice. Walden spent three years as a partner with O'Melveny & Myers LLP before joining the New York office of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP in 2006. In 2015, Walden left Gibson Dunn to found Walden Macht & Haran LLP with fellow former prosecutors Timothy Macht and Sean Haran. == Career as a federal prosecutor ==  Heroin trafficking  While an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York, Walden led the prosecution of Li Yun-chung, a significant figure in an international heroin ring. U.S. Customs authorities conducted the then-largest seizure of heroin in U.S. history on June 20, 1991 in Hayward, California. Approximately three-quarters of a ton of heroin was seized with a street value of $2.5-$3 billion. Li was indicted in U.S. District Court in May 1996.  Mafia prosecutions  Following his work prosecuting heroin traffickers, Walden brought cases against members and associates of New York's most prominent Mafia families. In October 1999, Alphonse \\"Allie Boy\\" Persico, head of the Colombo crime family, was arrested on charges of loansharking. Walden helped build the cases against Persico. These charges resurfaced in 2001, when Persico was indicted in Brooklyn the same day he completed a 15-month prison sentence on weapons charges in Florida. Walden also successfully prosecuted Chris Paciello, aka Chris Ludwigsen, for his 1993 murder of Staten Island housewife Judith Shemtov killed during a robbery Paciello had planned in association with the Bonnanno crime family. Paciello turned himself in after murder charge were filed in November 1999. He pleaded guilty to those charges on October 13, 2000. Paciello only served a six-year sentence, Walden won guilty pleas from nearly 20 people related to the Shemtov murder. Benjamin Brafman, Paciello's attorney, \\"estimated that 'more than 70 people' had been prosecuted directly and indirectly as a result of [Paciello's] cooperation'\\". This included testimony that Alphonse Persico plotted with Paciello in 1997 to kill a dissident mafioso. The identification of two made members of the Bonanno family ultimately led to the take-down of the entire crime organization. Walden appears in a 2018 \\"Vanity Fair Confidential\\" episode discussing the Shemtov murder and the Paciello prosecution and is cited extensively in the book Clubland: The Fabulous Rise and Murderous Fall of Club Culture. In 2001, Walden led the successful prosecution of Anthony Spero, a soldier and one-time acting boss of the Bonanno crime family, on murder and racketeering charges. Spero was convicted on April 5, 2001 of ordering three murders during his 20 years serving the family. Walden's work prosecuting organized crime was profiled in the New York Times and featured in a documentary filmed by National Geographic. == Private sector ==  White collar defense  Following his work at the Department of Justice, in 2002 Walden entered private practice as a partner at O'Melveney & Myers LLP. He spent nearly four years there before joining Gibson Dunn & Crutcher in 2006. Walden co-chaired Gibson Dunn's White Collar-Criminal Defense & Investigations practice in addition to leading the office's pro bono efforts. In 2015, Walden started his own firm, Walden Macht & Haran LLP. The firm was founded with a focus on white-collar criminal defense, civil litigation and investigations. The firm also gave Walden a platform to continue representing advocacy and community groups.  Joseph Cassano and AIG  While a partner at Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, Walden, along with F. Joseph Warin, successfully represented Joseph Cassano, the CEO of AIG's Financial Products unit, for his alleged role in the 2008 financial crisis. U.S. Department of Justice investigators and prosecutors conducted an investigation into whether Cassano deliberately withheld information from investors and auditors. Walden utilized a proactive defense strategy by engaging prosecutors early in the process to present evidence, rather than engaging the public. Neither the Department of Justice nor the Securities and Exchange Commission ultimately brought charges against Cassano.  Molly Bloom  In 2013, Walden represented Molly Bloom, who was arrested and charged as part of a $100 million illegal poker game in Los Angeles that attracted wealthy individuals and celebrities. In 2014, Walden secured a lenient sentence for Bloom who was facing six months in federal prison for her involvement in the gambling ring. Bloom later wrote a book about her experiences called Molly's Game which was turned into a 2017 film by Aaron Sorkin. Actor Idris Elba portrays a fictionalized character based loosely on Walden.  Tether USDT  In 2019, Walden initiated representation of Tether, a cryptocurrency stablecoin company, in a consolidated class action lawsuit alleging $1.4 trillion in market manipulation damages.  William Anderson & Newsweek Fraud Investigation  In 2020, Walden defended William Anderson in a case stemming from a $30 million fraud and money-laundering investigation of Newsweek magazine executives, and related criminal charges, filed by the Manhattan District Attorney. Anderson plead guilty and received a non-custodial sentence.  WeWork Class Action Litigation  In 2020, during the COVID-19 public health crisis, Walden represented WeWork customers located in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and other U.S. cities, in a class action litigation demanding that the company cease charging their membership fees until public health restrictions were lifted. The plaintiffs also asked for sterilization of office spaces.  St. Bernard’s School  In 2020, Walden represented a group of parents of St. Bernard’s School, located in New York City, in a class action lawsuit against members of the school board over the board's removal of the school headmaster and alleged financial malfeasance.  Computer Associates  In 2003, Walden represented Lloyd Silverstein, who was charged in Federal Court along with a number of other executives, with financial mismanagement at Computer Associates. As the case moved towards trial in 2004, Walden negotiated a plea arrangement with the prosecutor that helped Silverstein avoid jail time completely. In 2007, Silverstein, the former senior vice president of finance at Computer Associates, became the first executive to testify in what ultimately became a $2.2 billion accounting scandal.  CareCredit LLC  In 2013, Walden negotiated a voluntary settlement with New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman on behalf of CareCredit LLC, a subsidiary of GE Capital Retail Bank. At the time of the inquiry, CareCredit was the largest issuer of consumer health care financing in the United States, with approximately 160,000 providers nationwide. The company was under investigation for alleged deceptive business practices.  TRW Deutschland Holding GmbH  Walden represented TRW Deutschland Holding GmbH, a global auto parts manufacturer, in connection with an international antitrust investigation spearheaded by the United States Department of Justice in 2012. TRW agreed to a favorable plea arrangement for its involvement in a conspiracy to fix prices of seat belts, airbags and steering wheels installed in cars sold in the United States.  Raymond Felton  In 2012, New York Knicks point guard Raymond Felton was arrested on two felony weapons possession charges after his estranged wife turned in a loaded gun belonging to Felton to a local police precinct. Felton had purchased the gun legally in North Carolina but never secured a permit in New York. Walden represented Felton in the matter and secured a noncustodial sentence and small fine for Felton. Felton avoided jail time.  Kyle O'Quinn  Walden was retained by New York Knicks forward Kyle O'Quinn in connection with an assault charge in 2017. Walden convinced the Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance to drop the criminal investigation against O'Quinn.  Colonial Management Group LLC  In 2014, Walden represented Colonial Management Group LLC, the managers of a 42-property portfolio under investigation by New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman. The management company was under investigation for allegations of tenant harassment. Under the settlement, the owners will provide more than $1 million in rent credits to tenants living in nearly 1,700 apartments. The agreement also required that delayed maintenance projects be completed within a year and that the management company be terminated. == \\"Good government\\" cases == New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy: Tax Incentive Task Force On January 24, 2019, the office of New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy announced that Jim Walden was selected as Special Counsel to a Task Force assigned to investigate the tax incentive program of the state's Economic Development Agency. In his time at Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, and continuing at the firm he founded, Walden brought several cases against governmental and employer overreach and abuse.  Mental Health Project at the Urban Justice Center  In conjunction with the Mental Health Project at the Urban Justice Center, Walden was the lead attorney in a 2011 class action lawsuit against five Queens, NY administrative law judges alleging bias against Social Security applicants. The judges named in the lawsuit rejected an average of 63 percent of the cases they heard in the fiscal year the lawsuit was filed, compared with a national average of 36 percent based on an analysis by the New York Times. This action resulted in a settlement agreement, wherein an estimated 4,000 applicants had their cases reheard and the five judges underwent retraining. Walden and the legal team drew praise from the National Organization of Social Security Claimants' Representatives for their efforts.  Harris v. Eggleston  Walden was also part of the legal team at Gibson Dunn representing the plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit Harris v. Eggleston. The lawsuit charged that thousands of people were illegally denied food stamps after they moved to receive Social Security disability payments instead of welfare benefits. The lawsuit settled in 2006 and two years later nearly 9,500 households received approximately $12 million in awards.  Long Island College Hospital  Walden was instrumental in negotiating a settlement with the State University of New York in litigation involving the sale of Long Island College Hospital. The settlement deal opened the door to keep the site a hospital and required officials to consult with unions and the community before choosing a proposal. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio applauded Walden's efforts at a press conference where De Blasio remarked, \\"If there is magic in the law, Jim Walden has found it. Because we sometimes seemed out of options. And Jim Walden would typically burst into the room and come up with a new option. And they had – his options had the extraordinary tendency to work.\\"  Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund  While at Gibson Dunn, Walden worked with the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund in their representation of El'Jai Devoureau. The case was the first lawsuit to challenge the firing of a transgender person from a job where being male or female is a job qualification. The question at the heart of the case was whether someone living as a man and recognized by the government as a man was considered male in the context of employment.  New York City Department of Education  In April 2016, Walden filed a federal class-action lawsuit on behalf of a group of 11 students and their families along with the non-profit organization Families for Excellent Schools, against the New York City Department of Education. The suit alleged that the DOE and Chancellor Farina did not do enough to prevent bullying in schools and depriving students of their right to receive an education free of violence, bullying and harassment. The suit asked the City to develop improved means of addressing school violence and appoint an independent monitor to oversee the DOE's progress. At a news conference announcing the suit, Walden, stated that \\"We felt compelled to take action because our children are being subjected to violence, the violence is increasing, and we are seeing the tragic results almost daily.\\" In March 2018, the lawsuit was settled. Under the settlement, DOE was required to issue a new regulation and launch an entirely reworked system for reporting, investigating, and re-mediating bullying complaints, including by launching an electronic system so parents can track the progress of bullying investigations. The settlement also required DOE to grant a substantive new right to a safety transfer if the victim feels unsafe in the school despite other forms of remediation. Walden noted that \\"This settlement finally brings meaningful reform to a troubled and broken system that placed every New York City school student in dire and dangerous circumstances.\\"  NYCHA  In February 2018, Walden filed a landmark lawsuit against the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) on behalf of a group of public housing residents. The suit demands that the Court impose an independent monitor over NYCHA to ensure future compliance with the law. The suit claims that NYCHA has failed to protect residents from toxic lead, failed to provide heat or hot water during bitter winter temperatures, and failed to provide economic opportunity as mandated under Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act. The complaint also notes that NYCHA failed to consult with residents on significant policy changes and is negligent in safeguarding residents from hazards such as mold, vermin, roaches and malfunctioning elevators. After Walden filed suit, he invited New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to tour a dilapidated housing project. In his invitation, Walden asked that the Governor and the state assembly declare a state of emergency to address the problems quickly. At a press conference with Walden and other elected officials outside of a public housing project in East Harlem, Cuomo accepted Walden's demands that an independent contractor be hired with state funds to repair all apartments citywide and to press the New York State Legislature for an additional $250 million to make urgent repairs. Cuomo declared a state of emergency on April 2, 2018, allowing for the establishment of an independent monitor to oversee the distribution of $250 million in state approved funding to quickly repair buildings operated by NYCHA. The monitor is also tasked with overseeing $350 million in funds previously pledged but not released to NYCHA. The decision created an unusually high level of friction between Cuomo and NYC Mayor Bill DeBlasio following the Mayor's lack of response to the crisis. Walden \\"heard crickets\\" from City Hall when the lawsuit suit was filed. As the fallout from the lawsuit continued, the chairwoman of NYCHA, Shola Olatoye, was forced to resign and the judge overseeing the case ordered a preliminary injunction, forcing the New York City Housing Authority to immediately complete lead inspections inside thousands of apartments housing children.  District Attorneys Association of the State of New York  In October 2018, Walden filed a lawsuit on behalf of the District Attorneys Association of the State of New York (DAASNY). The complaint, which names Gov. Andrew Cuomo and others as defendants, claims that a law signed by Cuomo to establish a panel to probe accusations of prosecutorial misconduct is unconstitutional. The bill, S2412D, passed through the New York Legislature in June 2018, creates the Commission of Prosecutorial Conduct and authorizes the commission to “receive, initiate, investigate and hear complaints with respect to the conduct, qualifications, fitness to perform, or performance of official duties of any prosecutor, and may determine that a prosecutor be admonished, censured or removed from office.” The lawsuit claimed that the creation of the Commission of Prosecutorial Conduct violates, among other provisions, the separation of powers doctrine between the three branches of state government by giving the Legislature and Court of Appeals power over district attorneys, who are executive officials. On January 28, 2020, the New York Supreme Court issued an opinion declaring the Commission on Prosecutorial Misconduct to be unconstitutional. Walden represented the DAASNY pro bono. == U.S. v. Mark Hazelwood, et al == Walden was hired as legal counsel to Mark Hazelwood, the former CEO of Pilot Flying J, in a criminal case stemming from a federal investigation into a fuel rebate scheme, which prosecutors claim was designed to defraud trucking companies doing business with Pilot Flying J. Hazelwood has maintained his innocence. Hazelwood was found guilty in February 2018 for his part in the scheme and was sentenced to 12½ years in prison on charges of wire fraud, witness tampering and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. After taking the case, Walden found exculpatory evidence and filed a motion for a new trial, which the trial judge denied. Although Hazelwood faced a maximum sentence of 20 years in jail, Walden argued for a more lenient sentence, presenting evidence that the withheld discounts had no financial impact on Pilot's customers. The judge credited the evidence, granted Walden's request for a more lenient sentence, and imposed a term of 12 ½ years. Walden has vowed to appeal the case. == Representation of Brittany Kaiser == Walden represents Brittany Kaiser, the former director of business development for SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. Kaiser acted as a whistleblower about her knowledge of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal which exposed more than 87 million Facebook accounts to abuse and may have impacted the outcome of the 2016 US presidential campaign. She is alleged to have discussed the 2016 US Presidential Election with Julian Assange of Wikileaks in 2017, which Walden denies. == Representation of Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov == Walden was the attorney for Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia's national anti-doping laboratory. Rodchenkov's role as a whistle-blower helped expose Russia's state-sponsored doping system. Crucially, Rodchenkov kept a contemporaneous diary that included entries related to the doping system he oversaw. The diaries detailed specific discussions about cheating that Rodchenkov conducted with prominent Russian officials. On December 5, 2017, the International Olympic Committee announced its decision to ban Russia from the 2018 Winter Olympics. Rodchenkov's work is detailed in the Netflix documentary Icarus which includes a brief appearance by Walden discussing how Rodchenkov's life is in danger following his revelations about Russian doping. At the 90th Academy Awards, given out in March 2018, the film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Despite overwhelming evidence of doping, in February 2018 the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) issued a ruling to reinstate 28 Russian athletes who had appealed their lifetime bans on competition. Walden called the decision a \\"mockery\\": > Forty-three individual Russian athletes were banned by a disciplinary > commission in December 2017. But when the athletes appealed, the IOC > capitulated to a process that was harried and disorganized, leaving key > evidence out of the record. The result was a disaster. The CAS has now > disregarded the evidence and reversed bans for 28 of the doped athletes. The > millions of dollars spent by the WADA and the IOC to gather and assemble > proof of the Russian doping system appear to have been for nothing: The CAS > panel brushed it all aside with the stroke of a pen. In February 2018, Walden testified before the U.S. Helsinki Commission to discuss global corruption in international sport and, specifically, the efforts by Russia to circumvent doping testing. Walden said that the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Olympic Committee need to step up their efforts to enforce doping regulations and restore integrity to the international athletic community. Walden underscored the importance of protecting whistleblowers to encourage future transparency in global competition. Following the conclusion of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Peyongchang, South Korea, Thomas Bach, president of the IOC, reinstated Russia's Olympic Committee, effectively reversing a ban which had been in place following the doping claims by Dr. Rodchenkov. Walden called the move an act of \\"cowardice and appeasement.\\" In February 2018, Russian oligarch Mikhail Prokhorov, who is controlling owner of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team, agreed to finance a defamation lawsuit in New York against Rodchenkov. The suit claims that Rodchenkov defamed three Russian biathletes — Olga Zaytseva, Yana Romanova and Olga Vilukhina — when Rodchenkov included them on a list of athletes who took performance-enhancing drugs as part of a state-controlled program that corrupted the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. The women, who were stripped of the silver medal they won as part of a relay team, are seeking $10 million each in damages. In April 2018, Walden counter-sued Prokhorov on behalf of Rodchenkov under New York's anti-SLAPP law, claiming that Prokhorov's suit was frivolous and intended to limit an individual's right to exercise their First Amendment rights to free speech. According to published reports, the counter-suit is likely to seek the names of other individuals who are financing the lawsuit against Rodchenkov as well as information about the assets of Prokhorov. Walden stated that he believes Prokhorov's lawsuit was intentionally designed to uncover Rodchenkov's whereabouts in the United States and allow agents of the Russian government to find him. Walden testified before the Helsinki Commission for a second time on July 25, 2018, along with Travis Tygart, CEO of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, Yulia Stepanova, a former Russian track star, and Katie Uhlaender, an American skeleton racer who finished fourth in the Sochi Olympics.https://www.tampabay.com/hearing-points-to-putins-role-in-russian- doping-scandal-ap_sports6bc6805ca91548dbbf22501ed9f0fe37 In his testimony, Walden claimed that Putin had created a \\"gangster state\\" in Russia. Walden has been highly critical of WADA's efforts to properly reprimand Russia for that country's decades-old state-sponsored sports doping program. In September 2018, WADA announced that it would be lifting the ban on Russia's participation in international sporting competition. Walden called the decision \\"the greatest treachery against clean athletes in Olympic history.\\" Walden has suggested that the United States is wasting its money funding for WADA because the organization \\"is obviously impotent to address Russia's state-sponsored doping.\\" == References  External links == * Bio – Walden Macht & Haran LLP Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Assistant United States Attorneys Category:Law firm founders Category:Lawyers from New York City Category:Temple University Beasley School of Law alumni Category:People associated with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher ","title":"Jim Walden (lawyer)"},{"id":"56044151","text":"The 2017–18 UMass Minutewomen basketball team represents the University of Massachusetts Amherst during the 2017–18 college basketball season.

The California-based company designs and retails a line of mostly denim-based clothing. The company has become known for its relatively affordable pricing, environmentally friendly design and manufacturing, a direct-to-consumer retail strategy. ==History== DSTLD was founded by co-CEOs Corey Epstein and Mark Lynn. The company was first founded by Epstein as 20Jeans and operated by buying overstock fabric from Los Angeles-based high-end jeans designers to be sent overseas, to places like Hong Kong and Shanghai, turning the fabric waste into low-cost jeans that the company then resold for $20. Epstein was joined Lynn and the two rebranded the company as DSTLD in April 2014. They hired Anh Vu, formerly of Gap Inc. to head the initial design team. In April 2016, DSTLD hired designer Paul Roughley, previously of Kill City Clothing, as the new design director. The company gained a seed round investment of $4.4 million from investors including CAA Ventures and CrunchFund. In September 2015, the company announced that it will be using the SeedInvest platform to offer its customers the opportunity to directly invest in the start-up. The crowdfunding was made possible by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. By the end the month, \\"DSTLD had received more than $7.6 million in indicated interest.\\" In summer 2016, the company announced a Series A round open to the public. As of August 2016, it had gained funds \\"from more than 450 people investing an average of $2,400.\\" By April 2017, using SeedInvest, the company had raised $1.75 million. In August 2017, the company reopened the platform for a second round of investment through crowdfunding. In January 2019, DSTLD announced it was looking to open a UK showroom and list on London's AIM stock market. The company intends to use the funds it raised at the end of 2018 for the expansion- around £1.6 million. ==Operations== Until the launch of its first pop-up shop DNM Bar: LA, the company's retail operations relied entirely on online sales. The pop-up shop opened in October 2014 was located in West Hollywood and expected to last until the end of the year holiday season. Besides this occasional retail space, DSTLD relies mostly on online sales to reach its customers. As of July 2017, seventy percent of DSTLD's total product offerings are made at manufacturing facilities located in the United States. The company conducts an inspection of its new contractor facilities and requires that they abide by \\"a set of minimum worker and environmental standards\\". However, it does not currently have the capability to regularly audit these facilities to ensure they continue to meet these standards. ==References *Official Website *URG Networks Category:2010s fashion Category:Social enterprises Category:Companies based in Los Angeles Category:2014 establishments in California Category:Clothing companies of the United States Category:Online clothing retailers of the United States Category:American companies established in 2014 Category:Clothing companies established in 2014 ","title":"DSTLD"},{"id":"56044275","text":"Sankt Pauls Gade with a Nyboder terrace to the right Sankt Pauls Gade (lit. St. Paul's Street) is a street in the Nyboder Quarters of central Copenhagen, Denmark. The street passes St. Paul's Church from which it takes its name. The space in front of the church is called Sankt Pauls Plads (St. Paul's Square). ==History== Sankt Pauls Gade in 1897 Olfert Fischers Gade traces its history back to Christian IV's foundation of Nyboder navel barracks in 1931 but different sections of it were then known under individual names. The section from Store Kongensgade to Borgergade was called Pindsvinegade (Hedgehog Street), the section from Borgergade to Kronprinsessegade was called Enhjørningsgade (Unicorn Street) and the section from Kronprinsessegade to Rigensgade was called Salviegade (Sage Street). The street names followed the general naming practive in Nyboder where the streets in the eastern part of the area were named after animal species and the streets in the western part of the area were named after herbs and medical plants. The Nyboder area was located outside Copenhagen's city until the area known as New Copenahgen was incorporated into the fortified city by moving the East Rampart. This had been the plan from before Nyboder was planned but had been delayed due to lack of funding. The Nyboder terraces in Pindsvinegade were replaced by taller buildings in the 1850s. Several of the buildings were built by a wealthy merchant named H. P. Lorentzens and the street was renamed Lorentzensgade in 1855. In 1891, Lorentzensgade, Enhjørningsgade and Salviegade were renamed Sankt Pauls Gade after St. Paul's Church. ==Notable buildings== The single- storey Nyboder terrace with the Factory Master's House at the far end Sankt Pauls Gade is home to the only single-storey terrace that survives from Nyboder's earliest days. It now contains a small museum dedicated to the history of the development. At the eastern end of the terrace (towards Borgergade) is a short two-storey section known as the Factory Master's House (Fabriksmesterens Hus). It is the result of an expansion in 1817. The Factory Master headed the construction of new ships at Nyholm. No. 15-31: A Grey Row Across the street from the single-storey Nyboder terrace at No. 15-31 is one of the so-called Grey Rows which were built in 1886-1893 to designed by Olaf Schmidth. They were designed with inspiration from Arbejdernes Byggeforening's building society houses. The Grey Rows are most spacious at the end which contained apartments for officers. Listed building on the corner with Borgergade The corner building on the other side of Borgergade (Norgergade 140) is from 1854 and was probably designed by Peter Christoph Hagemann. It was listed on the Danish Registry of Protected Buildings and Places in 1984. St.Paul's Church is built in red brick and was designed by Johannes Emil Gnudtzmann. ==References * Sankt Pauls Gade at indenforvoldene.dk * Source Category:Streets in Copenhagen ","title":"Sankt Pauls Gade"},{"id":"56044278","text":"Wing Commander Douglas Rivers Bagnall DSO DFC (23 September 1918 – 28 December 2000) led a number of successful Vickers Wellington operations in support of Allied forces in Sicily, Italy and the North African desert during World War II. ==Early life and education== Douglas Rivers Bagnall was born in Auckland, New Zealand to Alfred Ernest Bagnall and Henrietta and was educated at King's Preparatory School and King's College, Auckland before reading commerce at Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington. ==Career== Bagnall trained as an RAF pilot and was commissioned in 1938. In May 1939 he was posted as a pilot officer to No. 216 Squadron, a bomber transport unit flying Vickers Valentia biplanes at Heliopolis in Egypt. By May 1942 he was Acting Squadron Leader of No. 108 Squadron, part of 205 Group RAF, and flying Vickers Wellington bombers. In March 1943, aged 24, he was promoted to Wing Commander of another 205 Group unit, No. 40 Squadron – also equipped with Wellingtons. Bagnall, though popular and outgoing, was a disciplinarian who eschewed the easy familiarity between ranks that had marked the tenure of his predecessor at 40 Squadron, John Morton. One of his first achievements as commanding officer was to re-equip the squadron with the updated and more powerful Wellington Mk III and Mk X, which replaced the obsolescent Mk IC model in service at the time. For the next 12 months the squadron, which soon became part of the US 15th Air Force in General Carl Spaatz's North West African Air Force, supported Allied troops in their final battles against the Germans in Tunisia. It then moved on to the Sicilian and Italian landings and campaigns. Bagnall was awarded a Distinguished Service Order for his part in an attack on marshalling yards at Battipaglia, Italy, during the Allied amphibious assault on Salerno in 1943; and a second, American, Distinguished Flying Cross in 1944. He was awarded his earlier (UK) DFC while with No.108 Squadron, in May 1942. Bagnall's exceptional qualities as a pilot were well illustrated in a bombing raid on Recco railway viaduct, slightly to the east of Genoa, during the night of November 10, 1943. It was an interdiction mission, aimed at denying the Germans reinforcement of their positions further south. The twin- track viaduct was in a near impregnable natural position, running across a narrow defile protected by cliffs on three sides. The lead Wellington, captained by Bagnall, was armed with a 4000-pound 'blockbuster' barrel bomb on a short time-delay fuse; it was accompanied by 11 other Wellingtons and two pathfinder planes to light up the target with flares. The bomb-aimer, Flight Lieutenant Allan Brodie, recalled: \\"We made five dummy runs, each one bringing us closer to the viaduct. The cliffs reared above us and to the north I could see the buildings on the outskirts of the town of Recco. On the sixth run a stick of flares exploded, providing us with perfect light but I could see we would have to get even closer to be successful...The Wing Commander assured me he could. He switched off the intercom and I felt the Wellington go into a steep bank. Round we went in the tightest turn I had ever experienced. The Wellington behaved perfectly as we came round, almost standing on a wing- tip...The aircraft was practically catapulted upwards as it gave birth to its giant bomb. The pilot increased the power as we climbed away. Every ounce of speed was necessary as we only had eleven seconds to get clear of the area before the blast... We circled back and saw a complete section of the viaduct had been destroyed and that a train emerging on the north side had been caught up in the blast.\\" Wing Commander Douglas Rivers Bagnall (top left) with Air Marshal H.E.P. Wigglesworth (left), at a SHAEF Air Staff briefing in February 1945 In April 1944 Bagnall, by now the longest-serving war-time commander of 40 Squadron since Major Leonard Tilney in 1917, transferred to the Joint Planning Staff of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), where he became assistant to the Deputy Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal H. E. P. Wigglesworth. Electing to stay in the RAF after the war ended, Bagnall accepted the temporarily reduced rank of Flight Lieutenant and in July 1945 was posted to RAF Defford in Worcestershire, where he worked as a pilot experimenting with radar equipment at the Royal Radar Establishment. In July 1950 he was posted as an RAF intelligence officer to Singapore, then still a British colony. He returned to the UK in May 1953 as part of the planning team responsible for the RAF Coronation review held in honour of the new queen, Elizabeth II. In August 1953 he was posted to the USAF's 20th Fighter Bomber Wing, based in Essex, England. In 1957 he moved to the Vulcan bomber station at RAF Scampton and, less than a year later, was doing a stint as a staff officer on Bomber Operations at the Air Ministry. His last position, which he took up early in 1963, was at the Lightning station at RAF Wattisham, Suffolk. He retired from the RAF, with the rank of Wing Commander, on September 23, 1965. ==Personal life== Bagnall married Caroline Welham in 1945. After retiring from the RAF, he and his wife spent the next 11 years sailing the world in his 60-ft ketch, Tirrenia II. He eventually settled at Hergest Croft, Kington, Herefordshire. He was an active sportsman, playing rugby for Wasps after the war, and was a keen golfer. Douglas Rivers Bagnall died in Hereford on 28 December 2000. ==References== Category:1918 births Category:2000 deaths Category:People educated at King's College, Auckland Category:New Zealand Companions of the Distinguished Service Order Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:People from Auckland Category:Royal Air Force pilots of World War II Category:Royal Air Force officers ","title":"Douglas Rivers Bagnall"},{"id":"56044306","text":"Tommee James Profitt (born November 12, 1984) is an American songwriter and producer. ==Biography == Profitt is originally from Grand Rapids, Michigan.

They have continued to be frequent collaborators, with Profitt collaborating on the writing and production on NF's four full-length releases that have been released under Capitol CMG. The first album, Mansion, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Christian Albums chart and peaked at No. 62 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart.

Internal view of the Piano Mill The Pianists A Piano Mill is a hybrid building and musical instrument located at Willsons Downfall in Northern New South Wales, Australia. It was designed and purpose-built to house sixteen reclaimed pianos in a tower structure. The instrument is designed to have the sixteen pianos played simultaneously. ==History== The first Piano Mill, constructed in Willsons Downfall, Northern New South Wales, Australia, was designed by architect Bruce Wolfe specifically for composer Erik Griswold. This structure is a copper clad tower approximately 9m tall with a footprint of 4.5m X 4.5m and its lowest floor is 1.6m above the ground allowing the pianos to be installed post-construction. The mill is equipped with tuned grader blades as chimes and two sonic periscopes. To launch The Piano Mill, Griswold composed a new work, All’s grist that comes to the mill, that responds to various influences such as architecture, the natural environment and Australia's colonial history. It was performed in the Piano Mill on Sunday March 27, 2016, and since that time there have been two subsequent pieces written for the instrument. The first Piano Mill has won awards including a World Architecture Festival 2018 Award for the Culture category, a National Commendation at the Australian Institute of Architects 2017 Awards and a National Award for Experimental Music at the 2017 APRA AMCOS Art Music Awards. == References  External links == *https://architectureau.com/articles/the-piano-mill/ *http://www.thepianomill.org/ *https://uropublications.com/products/the-piano- mill Category:Piano Category:Australian music Category:Entertainment venues in New South Wales ","title":"Piano Mill"},{"id":"56044323","text":"Eugene Cordero is an American actor, writer, and comedian.

He presents content on YouTube centred around LGBTQ+ issues and his experiences transitioning as a trans man. His channel, \\"TheRealAlexBertie\\", has over 300,000 subscribers. He has been featured as an LGBTQ+ panelist for Summer in the City, a gathering for the UK YouTube community in London, in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. In 2017, he published an autobiography of his transition journey entitled Trans Mission: My Quest to a Beard through a Hachette Children's Group imprint; Wren & Rook. == Early life and education == Alex Ash Bertie was born 2 November 1995 to parents including Paul, a postman. The family, including Alex’s younger sister, live in the seaside town of Bournemouth, Dorset, England. He was assigned female at birth but even early on showed a tendency toward masculine interests usually seen in young boys. He liked action figures, toy cars, Lego, and cherished video games. Among his favourite memories was sitting sitting aside his father while Paul played Nintendo and Dreamcast. In primary school all his friends were male. He experienced bullying for a three year stretch because of his perceived non-heterosexuality, and also dealt with depression because of how society treated his gender dysphoria. He engaged in self-harm cutting, but later found relief from a LGBTQ-affirming group, Over the Rainbow, that shared information about transgender people. Bertie identified as female until fifteen years old, when he came out as a trans man to his family, friends, and online following. He vlogged his multi-year transition starting in 2008 when he was thirteen, on YouTube later calling the online sharing his \\"safe space\\". He originally sought more transitioning information on YouTube, but decided to share his experiences after finding little available. PopBuzz noted, \\"this kind of insight into a real person transitioning on a daily basis is fundamental for children either struggling with this concept or wanting to learn more about it for themselves\\". After struggling for family acceptance, in April 2016 he began hormone replacement treatment at The Laurels Gender Identity Clinic in Exeter, England. His younger sister embraced his gender transitioning first, his parents took longer but are now extremely supportive. In January 2017, he underwent a double mastectomy procedure (Peri-Areolar technique) by Andrew Yelland at the Nuffield Hospital, Brighton. He titled his YouTube channel \\"The Quest to Alex's Beard\\" and included the highs and lows of the journey, including his family’s slowly accepting his transition, so that other young trans men and women could see \\"it gets better\\". In October 2017, The Mail on Sunday published photos of Bertie without permission alongside what PinkNews characterized as the latest in a series of anti-trans articles. As of 2018 Bertie is holding off on bottom surgery to give him genitalia that match his gender identity. The two present surgery options are too risky, he awaits advances in the field. == Career == He presents content on YouTube centred around LGBTQ+ issues and his experiences transitioning as a trans man. His channel, \\"TheRealAlexBertie\\", has over 300,000 subscribers. He has been featured as an LGBTQ+ panelist for Summer in the City, a gathering for the UK YouTube community in London, in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. In 2017, he published an autobiography of his transition journey entitled Trans Mission: My Quest to a Beard through a Hachette Children's Group imprint; Wren & Rook. == Personal Life == Alex identifies as pansexual after openly expressing a sexual/romantic interest regardless of gender identity, although he mainly has been dating other trans men. Bertie dated fellow YouTuber Jake Edwards since 2014. The pair often make videos together online to their respective channels, as well as to an inactive channel 'Alex & Jake'. Their online fan base commonly refers to the two as 'AJthorki' or 'Jalex'. They broke up in 2018. == Awards and recognition == In 2018, Beatie won the Lovie Award from the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences for Creator for Change recognizing the best on the internet in Europe. ==References== Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:LGBT YouTubers Category:Pansexual people Category:People from Dorset Category:Transgender and transsexual men Category:Transgender and transsexual writers ","title":"Alex Bertie"},{"id":"56044388","text":"Commercial open-boat whaling by American and European ships occurred in the Sea of Okhotsk from the 1830s to the early 1900s.

Between 1850 and 1853 the majority of the fleet went to the Bering Strait region to hunt bowheads, but intense competition, poor ice conditions, and declining catches forced the fleet back to the Sea of Okhotsk. From 1854 to 1856, an average of over 160 vessels cruised in the sea each year. As catches declined between 1858 and 1860 the fleet shifted back to the Bering Strait region; by the mid-1860s few ships cruised in the sea.WSL, January 10, 1865, Vol. XXII, No. 45; January 22, 1867, Vol. XXIV, No. 47; January 14, 1868, Vol. XXV, No. 48.

The two Russian whaling stations of Mamga and Tugur – built by the Russian-American Company and Otto Wilhelm Lindholm, respectively – followed different itineraries. Once the ice broke up in June, boat crews or schooners cruised about for bowheads in Tugur Bay or adjacent bays and gulfs. When they caught a whale it was towed onto the beach, flensed, and its blubber boiled into oil at a nearby tryworks. In the fall the schooners were hauled onto the banks of the Mamga or Tugur rivers, where they were left for the winter; the men, meanwhile, spent the winter at one of the stations or went to Nikolayevsk. Supplies and men were obtained in Nikolayevsk and Hakodate, while the catch was shipped via chartered vessel either to Honolulu or San Francisco.Schooners Ayan and Caroline, 1863-1865, Mamga, in Evening Bulletin, of Honolulu, March 30, 1902, Vol. 1, No. 10.

It was made of hackmatack logs, had a \\"smoke hole\\" and stone hearth, and a \\"timber arrangement\\" (door) to keep out bears. They also stayed at the fishing settlement of \\"Dobra Town\\", at the mouth of the Uda River.

There could be as many as eighty men at a single encampment. There were occasions when boats couldn't go ashore at night due to bears and were forced to sleep in their anchored boats,Sharon, of Fairhaven, August 21, 1858, Taui Bay, NWC #609. while at other times they made it to the beach only to be driven from the shore by mosquitoes the next morning.Pacific, of New Bedford, July 30, 1854, Tugur Bay, NHA #295. When cruising for bowheads, boats paddled or rowed as the ice permitted or when there were calms and light airs, but they sailed when there was clear water and a fair breeze.Florida, of Fairhaven, July 30, 1859, Tugur Bay, in One Whaling Family (1964), p. 80. Whales were often caught some distance from the ship, forcing boat crews to lie by anchored whales all night.Frances Henrietta, of New Bedford, August 22, 1856, Tugur Bay, NWC #3932. They also went ashore and anchored or tied whales to rocks,Storfursten Constantin, of Helsinki, summer 1858, in Beyond Frontiers of Imperial Russia (2008), p. 94. the beach,Callao, of New Bedford, July 8, 1857, Konstantina Bay, NWC #156. or treesSharon, of Fairhaven, August 25, 1858, Taui Bay, NWC #609. or left whales with other ships so they could go off in search of their own vessel.Nassau, of New Bedford, August 13, 1855, near Shantar Islands, ODHS #612.Tempest, of New London, August 17-18, 1858, in Old Sailor's Story (1879), p. 94.Active, of New Bedford, August 27, 1854, Academy Gulf, NWC #11.Though whales left with other ships for too long could be flensed for halves to \\"save\\" the blubber. See Cicero, of New Bedford, August 14-19, 1858, Uda Gulf, ODHS #17. Those crews who couldn't find or catch whales sometimes resorted to picking up whalebone on the beach.Favorite, of Fairhaven, August 18, 1860, Shantar Islands, NWC #275. Lost or tired boat crews often went aboard other ships to get foodFavorite, of Fairhaven, July 23, August 3, 1860, Tugur Bay, NWC #275. or spend the night.Mary Frazier, of New Bedford, August 13, 1855, Academy Gulf, NWC. Some went from ship to ship before finding their own vessel, cruising for bowheads in between.Speedwell, of Fairhaven, July 30-31, 1854, Tugur Bay, NWC. Ships with lost boat crews on board went in search of their vessels,Hibernia, of New Bedford, July 12-13, 1854, Tugur Bay, NWC #328. while tired boat crews far from their ship hitched rides from other vessels.Betsey Williams, of Stonington, September 5-6, 1853, Taui Bay, NWC. Boats that couldn't find their own ships sometimes gave any whales they had caught to the nearest ship to flense for halves.Endeavor, of New Bedford, August 28, 1858, Medvezhy Island, NWC #226.Spartan, of Nantucket, July 23-25, 1859, south of Big Shantar Island, NHA #232. After not being able to find their ship for six days, two boats from the Massachusetts spent several days aboard the Cicero, even cruising for whales with her boats;Cicero, of New Bedford, August 9-11, 1855, Tugur Bay, KWM #51B. while two boats from the Daniel Wood were lost from their ship for five days before finding the Florida – wind-bound on the beach, their provisions had given out and they were forced to eat mussels for several days.Florida, of Fairhaven, July 3, 1859, Tugur Bay and Medvezhy Island, in One Whaling Family (1964), p. 71-72. When boats were out longer than expected, one of the boats was sent outRousseau, of New Bedford, July 8, 1855, ODHS #284. or returnedCarolina, of New Bedford, July 14, 1858, Academy Gulf, ODHS #1133. for extra provisions. Boat crews and schooners from Mamga and Tugur followed similar cruising patterns. Boats were fitted out for as long as a fortnight, sailing about for bowheads during the day and camping on the beach at night. American and Russian crews sometimes camped together.Java, of New Bedford, 1865-1866, Tugur Bay, in From Forecastle to Cabin (1905), p. 210. Boat crews from Nedorazumeniya Island were limited to cruises of several days' duration, operating from a station consisting of only two buildings: a tent of sails and a \\"cook house\\". They sailed or rowed about for whales during the day and either returned to the island at night, stopped at a convenient beach, or stayed at a native fishing settlement.Sharon, of Fairhaven, July 25-September 18, 1858, Taui Bay, NWC #609. Whereas boats were often sent inshore to look for bowheads, right whaling offshore was always ship-based,Triton 2nd, of New Bedford, August 24, 1855, eastern Sea of Okhotsk, NWC.Navy, of New Bedford, September 6-15, 1854, eastern Sea of Okhotsk, NWC. with three or four boats usually being lowered for whales.Charles W. Morgan, of New Bedford, August 30-September 17, 1902, southern Sea of Okhotsk, GBWL. Boats after right whales were gone from their ship for hoursTamerlane, of New Bedford, September 14, 1851, southern Sea of Okhotsk, ODHS. (not days or weeks, like boats searching for bowheads sometimes were), and seldom ventured far from their ship.Mechanic, of Newport, August 25, 1848, southern Sea of Okhotsk, NWC. While bowheads could be caught at night, boats that were still fast to right whales at sunset normally cut the whaleline and returned to the ship.Covington, of Warren, September 16, 1855, eastern Sea of Okhotsk, NWC. Unlike bowheads, which were sometimes flensed ashore due to distance and ice, right whales were taken in ice-free waters and relatively close to the ship, allowing them to be brought alongside and flensed.Fortune, of New Bedford, August 13-September 14, 1848, southern Sea of Okhotsk, ODHS.Two boats from the bark Alfred Tyler, of Edgartown, caught a right whale twelve miles from their own ship and in a fog. They brought it alongside another ship to be flensed for halves, a practice more common among boats cruising for bowheads. See Covington, of Warren, August 28-29, 1855, eastern Sea of Okhotsk, NWC. ==Factors== There were several factors that affected the ability of ships to catch whales. These included ice, tides, fog, wind, and competition. They often worked in tandem against them. Ships didn't lower for whales if it was too foggyMary Frazier, of New Bedford, August 8, 1855, Ulban Bay, NWC. or too ruggedMary Frazier, of New Bedford, August 27, 1855, off Bolshoy Shantar Island, NWC. and they collided with each otherBenjamin Rush, Antilla, both of Honolulu, Phillip 1st, of New London, and Coral, of New Bedford, July 11, 1860, Uda Gulf (ice), in Favorite, of Fairhaven, NWC #275. or the ice due to tides,Florida, of Fairhaven, August 5, 1860, Tugur Bay (ice), in One Whaling Family (1964), pp. 148-149. gales,Alice Frazier, and Milo, both of New Bedford, July 14, 1854, Tugur Bay area, ODHS #666.George and Mary, of New London, June 9, 1860, near Iony Island (ice), in Friend, Honolulu, November 1, 1860, Vol. 9, No. 11, p. 84. and fogs.Betsey Williams, of Stonington, and Canton, of New Bedford, August 21, 1853, Taui Bay, NWC.Nassau, of New Bedford, June 4, 1855, near Iony Island (ice), ODHS #612.

Ice and tides Ice and tides often worked together against the whalemen. Heavy floes of drift ice went to and fro with the tide,Navy, of New Bedford, August 13, 1861, south of Feklistova Island, KWM. striking and damaging ships,Java, of New Bedford, June 20-21, 1866, Uda Gulf, KWM. which were then beached at high tide and repaired at low tide.Storfursten Constantin, of Helsinki, 1860, Lebyazhya Bay, in Beyond the Frontiers of Imperial Russia (2008), pp. 129-130. Boats were nearly crushed by whirling pieces of ice as the tide turned or forced ashore by ice carried by the flood tide; when the tide ebbed, it left huge piles of ice on the beach. Schooners in their winter quarters were damaged by ice during spring tides.Caroline, winter of 1865-1866, Mamga, in Beyond the Frontiers of Imperial Russia (2008), p. 237. As the ships made their way through the pack ice their decks, sails, and rigging became covered with ice.Nassau, of New Bedford, May 12, 1854, offshore, ODHS #612.Erie, of Fairhaven, May 6, 1852, offshore, NWC #228.

Ships made fendersCicero, of New Bedford, July 16, 1863, Rocky Point Harbor (northeast of Uda Gulf), KWM #18. or used polesMontezuma, of New London, June 18, 1858, NWC #781. to keep the ice away; otherwise, they could sustain serious damage, ripping off their cutwatersGood Return, of New Bedford, June 27, 1854, off Big Shantar Island, ODHS. and copper sheathingMary Frazier, of New Bedford, June 2, 1859, NWC. or breaking chains and losing anchors.Lexington, of Nantucket, July 19, 1855, Tugur Bay, NHA #136.

To avoid this, boats were left with a man and kept at least thirty feet from the beach;Robin Hood, of Mystic, 1854, Tugur Bay area, in Three Times Around the World (1867), p. 85. they were also hauled up past the high tide mark so they wouldn't float away as the crew slept.

Bowheads were towed ashore at high tide and flensed as the tide fell; schooners were also hauled ashore for the winter at high tide.Benjamin Rush, of Honolulu, in Polynesian, Honolulu, December 8, 1860, Vol. XVII, No. 32. Among the best places to look for whales were the tide rips off Cape Wrangel and Cape Grote in Academy Gulf.Charles Melville Scammon papers, 1849-1911, Bancroft Library, UC Berkeley.

June and July were the foggiest months, followed by August; September and October, meanwhile, usually had more clear days.Montezuma, of New London, June-October, 1858-1860, NWC #781. Some ships left the sea after only a week due to constant fogs.North America, of New London, August 4-10, 1846, NWC #512. Ships fired guns, blew horns, rang bells, and beat on casks to avoid colliding with each other during fogs;Florida, of Fairhaven, June 29, 1859, off Medvezhy Island, in One Whaling Family (1964), pp. 69-70. they also fired guns so their boats could find them,India, of New Bedford, July 19, 1849, Ushki Bay, ODHS.Erie, of Fairhaven, July 25, 1852, near Sakhalin Island, NWC #228. which could be lost in the fog for days.Cicero, of New Bedford, August 14, 1861, Uda Gulf, KWM #18. Ships heard whales spouting all around them in the fog, but couldn't see them.Pacific, of Fairhaven, August 14, 1856, Tugur Bay, NWC. Boats chased whales in the fog,Frances Henrietta, of New Bedford, August 14, 1856, Tugur Bay, NWC #3932. tracking them by listening for their blows;Java, of New Bedford, 1865-1866, Academy Gulf, in From Forecastle to Cabin (1905), p. 216. when they caught one, they had to anchor it until the fog cleared.Speedwell, of Fairhaven, July 22, 1854, near Shantar Islands, NWC. Boats were forced to follow the shoreline during thick fogs.Sharon, of Fairhaven, July 31, 1858, Taui Bay, NWC #609. Fog also clung to clothing in big drops, chilling the men thoroughly.Java, of New Bedford, 1865-1866, near Lindholm Strait, in From Forecastle to Cabin (1905), p. 203. In the spring, swell, winds, and gales from the south broke up the pack ice offshore.Montezuma, of New London, April 30, May 2, May 13, 1859, NWC #781. In July and August calms and light airs prevailed in the bays, with few gales in the former month and the occasional gale in the latter one; but they became common in September and October,Montezuma, of New London, July-October, 1858-1860, NWC #781.Arnolda, of New Bedford, September 12-October 14, 1874, Shantar Islands, ODHS #925. forcing most shipsA few ships in the late 1850s used large anchors and chains to ride out storms in Uda Gulf in September and October and then lowered for whales when the weather permitted. They could catch a number of whales in this way. See Beyond the Frontiers of Imperial Russia (2008), pp. 116-117. to leave the bays as it became too rugged to whale.Eliza F. Mason, of New Bedford, October 17, 1856, near Shantar Islands, ODHS. Uda Gulf, in particular, was known for its sudden and violent storms.WSL, New Bedford, December 22, 1857, Vol. XV, No. 41.

One whaleman saw thirty-five boats after a single bowhead,Josephine, of New Bedford, July 29, 1860, Uda Gulf, KWM #122B. while another lamented that there were more boats than whales and boats in every direction chasing whales.Isabella, of New Bedford, July 29-30, 1854, Tugur Bay, NWC #174. Whales were seen carrying harpoons and trailing lines;Erie, of Fairhaven, May 24, 1852, offshore, NWC #228. one with four harpoons in it was being chased by eight boats.Cicero, of New Bedford, May 25, 1855, offshore, KWM #51B. A boat harpooning a whale could drive off all the other whales in the area.Carolina, of New Bedford, September 18, September 20, 1858, Tugur Bay, ODHS #1133. If boats from different vessels were after the same whale one crew would yell to scare it away so that the rival boat couldn't harpoon it.Covington, of Warren, and Thomas Dickason, of New Bedford, summer 1857, Tugur Bay area, in Deep Water Cruising (Peck, pp. 60-61), ODHS #0820. Boats also removed the harpoons of other ships that they found in whales adrift and replaced them with their own craft, claiming they had caught the whales themselves.Covington, of Warren, and Caroline, of New Bedford, summer 1858, in or near Lindholm Strait, in Deep Water Cruising (Peck, pp. 94-95), ODHS #0820. Ships picked up whales other ships had killed,Small dead whales could be caught with hook and line and hoisted aboard the ship whole.

Of twenty-one whales a ship had taken one season, eight were found dead.William Wirt, of New Bedford, May 11-August. 31, 1855, NWC #719. Boats from different ships raced each other for dead whales.Frances Henrietta, of New Bedford, September 9, 1856, Shantar region, NWC #3932. Stranded whales attracted bears,Boats would make sport of this by firing at the bears with bomb lances. See Covington, of Warren, summer 1857, Tugur Bay area, in Deep Water Cruising (Peck, p. 61), ODHS #0820. which came down from the mountains at night to feed on them.Florida, of Fairhaven, July 30, 1860, Academy Gulf, in One Whaling Family (1964), p. 147.

The episode was written and directed by Chris Carter and it aired on January 3, 2018, on Fox. This episode follows the events of \\"My Struggle II\\" and is noted for its major plot twists. \\"My Struggle III\\" helps to explore the series' overarching mythology and serves as the first of three mythology episodes of the season. Two taglines are featured in this episode: \\"I Want to Believe\\", followed by \\"I Want to Lie\\". The show centers on FBI special agents who work on unsolved paranormal cases called X-Files; focusing on the investigations of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) after their reinstatement in the FBI. In this episode, revolving around the time after the previous episode's conclusion, Scully ends up in the hospital after experiencing a seizure, revealing the events of the previous episode to be a vision of an apocalyptic future. Mulder and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) find a message from Scully with the words \\"Find him\\", which refers to their son William. ==Plot== The episode opens with an introduction by the Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis), in which his full name is revealed as Carl Gerhard Busch Spender. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) wakes up in the hospital after having a seizure, now realizing the apparent invasion was a vision and hasn't actually happened yet. She tries to warn Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) about the plague. Mulder initially presumes Scully’s ramblings are a product of her illness, but leaves the hospital to investigate. Elsewhere, Agent Jeffrey Spender is chased down and hit by a car in a parking garage. Spender hides behind a door of an apartment building as his would-be assailant demands the whereabouts of a boy. Spender calls Mulder and the Smoking Man intercepts the call, revealing that he is in a room with Monica Reyes. A car chase soon unfolds in which Mulder is able to evade another man. Spender later appears at Scully’s bedside, revealing that someone is looking for William. He first balks at telling her the location of her son, revealing only the name of the family that adopted him - Van De Kamp. Mulder tails a henchman who he believes will take him to the Smoking Man, but he arrives somewhere else with mysterious conspirators; Mr. Y (A.C. Peterson) and Erika Price (Barbara Hershey). The pair says they were once part of the Syndicate, but have their own agenda involving the colonization of space. They try to negotiate with Mulder into turning over his son, but Mulder refuses. Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) tries to meet with Scully, but can't find her. As he goes to his car, he is met inside by the Smoking Man and Reyes, the latter holding him at gunpoint. The Smoking Man asks Skinner to turn his back on humanity in return for immunity from the Spartan virus, but Skinner is very hesitant. Meanwhile, Scully tries to leave the hospital but her seizures return, causing her to crash her car. She is rescued by Agent Einstein and Agent Miller, and is readmitted to the hospital. Both agents leave the room. An assassin sent by Mr. Y and Erika enters and tries to suffocate Scully, but Mulder steps in and saves her by slicing the assassin's neck. After Mulder kills the assassin, Scully says that she doesn’t think the Smoking Man sent him. She then reveals her visions are from William. As Skinner comes in, Mulder confronts him since he smells like smoke. In a flashback to Skinner in a car with the Smoking Man, the latter states in a further flashback that he, not Mulder, artificially impregnated Scully. The final scene (out of focus) shows a teen, presumably William, having seizures. ==Production== Filming Filming for the season began in August 2017 in Vancouver, British Columbia, where the previous season was filmed, along with the show's original five seasons. Writing The mythology from the previous event series of The X-Files, had negative reviews, causing Chris Carter to focus less on the mythology and have more standalone stories. In various interviews Carter had already planned the solution to \\"My Struggle II\\", while it was in production. The episode is notorious for completely changing a respective part of the show's mythology: revealing that Mulder is not William's father, but that Cigarette Smoking Man had drugged and raped (\\"artificially impregnated\\") Scully years ago. This also answers a respective scene from season 7 episode \\"En Ami\\" in which Scully woke up in a room in pajamas during a road trip with the Cigarette Smoking Man, accusing him of drugging her. The dialogue in the scene was slightly altered. According to Chris Carter, he planned this strategy ever since that episode was filmed. He explains that it \\"adds to the characters in an interesting emotional way. And because the audience is now in on this truth, and Mulder and Scully are not, these revelations are huge for this show because they're huge for the characters. Mulder and Scully's life history, both professional and personal, are the heart of the show.\\" Casting Besides main cast members David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson and Mitch Pileggi, the episode features several guest stars, including original series stars William B. Davis and Annabeth Gish, and the return of Lauren Ambrose and Robbie Amell, whose characters debuted in season ten. The episode features the return of character Jeffrey Spender played by Chris Owens, who last appeared in the original series finale episode which aired in 2002. Barbara Hershey also makes her first appearance as a new recurring character, Erika Price. ==Reception== \\"My Struggle III\\" received generally mixed-to-negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 33% with an average rating of 5.96 out of 10 based on 9 reviews. In its initial broadcast in the United States on January 3, 2018, it received 5.2 million viewers, which was a 62 percent decrease in viewership from the previous season premiere in 2016 which had 16.2 million viewers. In the United Kingdom, where the episode was broadcast on February 5, 2018 on Channel 5, it was watched by a total of 1.87 million viewers over a 28-day period, including on the timeshift channel, Channel 5 +1, and the on demand service, My5. ==References * Category:2018 American television episodes Category:The X-Files (season 11) episodes ","title":"My Struggle III"},{"id":"56045144","text":"Léonard She Okitundu Lundula (born 8 March 1946) is a Congolese diplomat who has served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and one of the Vice Prime Ministers of the Democratic Republic of the Congo since December 2016 until March 2019.

Sessions tied for second place in the 1947 U.S. Women's Open as an amateur, and was one of the 13 founders of the LPGA Tour in 1950. ==Early life and education== Sessions was born on February 22, 1923, and attended North Muskegon High School in the late 1930s. She was a tennis player in high school, winning a Michigan novice state championship when she was 16 years old; she also played basketball and softball. After Sessions was grounded for \\"sneaking off to play tennis in Grand Rapids\\", she took up golf. ==Career== Later, Sessions decided to pursue golf exclusively. She won a state junior title in 1941. The following year, she won the Western Michigan Women's event and made the quarterfinal round of the Women's Western Amateur. Although major golf tournaments were canceled the next few years because of World War II, Sessions remained active in local tournaments. In 1944, she was the medalist in qualifying for the Women's Western Amateur. Two years later, Sessions earned a Michigan state championship, and tied for fifth at the 1946 Titleholders Championship. In 1947, Sessions competed in national events while retaining her amateur status. At the 1947 U.S. Women's Open, Sessions completed four 18-hole rounds in 301 strokes. Her total gave her a second- place tie with fellow amateur Polly Riley, six strokes behind winner Betty Jameson. Sessions became the Mexican Open champion later in the year, and recorded an under-par round at Pinehurst Country Club, becoming the first female player to accomplish the feat. In early 1948, she turned professional. That year, she posted a top-10 finish in the U.S. Women's Open. In 1949, Sessions had her highest tournament finish as a professional: fifth place at the All American Open. Ill from leukemia that had not been diagnosed, she stopped playing professionally after that season. ==Later years== Although her career as a competitive golfer had ended, Sessions was one of the 13 founders of the LPGA Tour when the organization was formed in 1950. She was named one of the first two treasurers of the LPGA, along with Jameson. Sessions was a Wilson Sporting Goods staff professional, touring the U.S. to take part in golf clinics for the company. She became an athletic director in the Detroit school system. On December 23, 1966, she died in Detroit at the age of 43. ==Awards and honors== In 1987, Sessions was posthumously inducted into the Muskegon Area Sports Hall of Fame. One year later, she was inducted into the Michigan Golf Hall of Fame. ==References== Category:American female golfers Category:Golfers from Michigan Category:Sportspeople from Detroit Category:1923 births Category:1966 deaths ","title":"Sally Sessions"},{"id":"56045230","text":"The C.C.

Houston returned to the professional soccer scene with two clubs, both operating from 1978-80: the Houston Hurricane (NASL), and the Houston Summit (Major Indoor Soccer League). Professional soccer returned to Houston again from 1984-91 with the Dynamos, who competed in the United Soccer League, the Lone Star Soccer Alliance and independently in between. The Hotshots was the last professional soccer franchise in Houston before today's Dynamo, operating from 1994-2000 in the Continental Indoor Soccer League and the World Indoor Soccer League. Houston did not field a professional team from 2000 to 2005 but the city's ability to draw big crowds for friendlies placed it in the conversation to land a Major League Soccer club. Houston had become a hotspot for Mexican First Division club friendlies at Robertson Stadium (the future home of the Dynamo) and the opening of Reliant Stadium, thanks to the return of an NFL team to Houston in 2002, made it a hot destination to host international friendlies. Houston Texans Chief Development Officer Steve Patterson (whose organization was looking to bring an MLS franchise to Houston) spearheaded efforts to host a USA vs. Mexico friendly in May 2003, a rematch of the two nations historic round of 16 encounter at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, as the first soccer match at Reliant Stadium. The 69,582 attendance set a new record for a soccer match in Texas (surpassing the 63,500 for Netherlands vs. Brazil at the Cotton Bowl in a 1994 FIFA World Cup quarter-final) and became the third largest crowd for a United States men's national team friendly. Bringing an MLS club to the Bayou City MLS Commissioner Don Garber revealed on November 16, 2005 that the league had granted permission to San Jose Earthquakes' owners Anschutz Entertainment Group to relocate the team for the 2006 season, giving the entertainment giant 30 days to make a decision. Garber was in Houston and spoke with the media before an international friendly between Mexico and Bulgaria at Reliant Stadium, citing Houston as a next destination for an MLS club whether the Earthquakes moved or not. On December 15, 2005, Major League Soccer announced the relocation of the San Jose franchise, along with all players and coaches under contract, to Houston. The Earthquakes name, colors and competition records were retained by the league for a possible expansion team. According to MLS, AEG had invested more than $20 million in the Earthquakes since purchasing the team in 2003 and suffered significant losses during that period because of its stadium deal. AEG had previously considered Houston as a site to relocate to and entered \\"positive discussions\\" about finding a soccer stadium in Houston. A ceremony was held outside Houston City Hall on December 16, 2005 to officially announce the franchise's arrival. Mayor Bill White joined city council members, Harris County officials, local soccer organizers and fans in welcoming team coach Dominic Kinnear and players Pat Onstad and Wade Barrett with cowboy boots and hats. It was disclosed that the team would train and play at the University of Houston's Robertson Stadium on a three-year lease with the university earning a percentage of the revenues from concessions, parking and other sources. In an immediate effort to plant roots in the community, AEG president and CEO Tim Leiweke announced former Houston Oilers quarterback Oliver Luck as the team's president and general manager. A previous NFL Europe executive, Luck had served as the head of the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority since 2001 and was instrumental in pursuing an MLS team for the city while also overseeing the construction of Minute Maid Park (home of the Astros), Reliant Stadium (home to the Texans) and the Toyota Center (home to the Rockets) during his tenure. == See also == * Soccer in the United States * Soccer in Los Angeles * Soccer in New York City * History of professional soccer in Seattle == References == Category:Soccer in Texas Soccer Houston ","title":"Soccer in Houston"},{"id":"56045395","text":"Cladosporium ear rot is a disease that affects maize. The disease is caused by the saprophytic fungus Cladosporium herbarum and is characterized by black or dark green fungal growths that cause black streaks on kernels. == Hosts and Symptoms == C. herbarum's main host is maize. Although there is usually little structural damage caused to the ears,Cladosporium Kernel Rot of Corn, Iowa State University Entomology Department, 22 Oct. 2004, .Munkvold, Gary, et al. \\"Corn Ear Rots, Storage Molds, Mycotoxins, and Animal Health.\\" Apr. 1997. the following symptoms are obvious during inspection: * grey to black or very dark green blotched or streaked fuzzy/powdery/sooty appearing spores on the kernels and in between themRobertson, Alison, and Gary Munkvold. \\"How Delayed Harvest Might Affect Ear Rots and Mycotoxin Contamination.\\" How Delayed Harvest Might Affect Ear Rots and Mycotoxin Contamination  Integrated Crop Management, ICM News, 30 Oct. 2009, crops.extension.iastate.edu/cropnews/2009/10/how-delayed- harvest-might-affect-ear-rots-and-mycotoxin-contamination.\\"Corn Ear and Kernel Rots.\\" University of Illinois Extension, Nov. 1991, ipm.illinois.edu/diseases/rpds/205.pdf.Darby, Heather. \\"Corn Ear Rot: The Newest Fungus Amongst Us!\\" UVM Extension, pss.uvm.edu/vtcrops/articles/Corn_Ear_Rot_VT_09.pdf. * black streaks and blotches start near the tips of kernels and develop towards the crown * advanced, fully colonized ears are dark and lightweight Plants that have poor husk coverage and weak seed coats allow for more frequent infection. Other factors that contribute to more infections are air currents that transport spores and an increase in vectors, including humans. C. herbarum is also known to infect various genera of mosses and interact with Fusarium species that cause Fusarium ear rot and stalk rot. Some of these Fusarium species produce mycotoxins that are harmful to humans and animals.Fakhrunnisa, et al. \\"In Vitro Interaction of Fusarium Spp., With Other Fungi.\\" 2006, www.pakbs.org/pjbot/PDFs/38(4)/PJB38(4)1317.pdf. The color of the fungal growth can be used to tell the various ear rots apart. For example, Cladosporium ear rot looks similar to Trichoderma ear rot, but Trichoderma ear rot has a more intense green color. Microscopic examination is needed to tell the difference for sure. == Environment == Environmental conditions that favor the infection and growth of Cladosporium herbarum are typical for most fungi, such as high moisture, correct temperature, low air flow, and neutral pH. Moisture is required for mold growth to occur, which is why C. herbarum's growth is strongly correlated with heavy rainfall in July, August, and September. Specifically, kernel moistures at or above 18% favor ear mold growth. Most of the fungal growth on ears and kernels occurs during the period of silking to harvest. Delayed harvest and delayed dry down in fields also gives the fungus more time to spread on the kernels and ears. Cool temperatures can slow, but not completely stop, fungal growth. Since C. herbarum isn't capable of penetrating its host on its own, it needs openings to get inside the plant, which are most commonly seen in stressed, frosted, or prematurely ripened plants. In particular, an early frost gives the best chance for early infection and colonization of cracked kernels due to the increased time to spread as the plant matures. Cracks in kernels can also be caused by natural growth, hail damage, or other insects and animals such as corn earworms, European corn borers, and birds. The fungus overseasons in crop residues, on the soil surface, or in stored grain. Grain in storage is also susceptible to fungal growth in the same conditions as those that favor growth while in the field. == Management == One of the most effective ways of managing Cladosporium ear rot is to identify its presence as early as possible and to manage the environment that the corn is grown and stored in. Scouting fields for ear rots, which should be done every two weeks, and testing for mycotoxin contamination is the first step in assessing whether or not ear rots in general are present, although no mycotoxin is associated with C. herbarum specifically. Problem fields can be characterized by having greater than 10% of ears that contain the fungus on 10-20% of the grain. Infected cobs should be harvested as soon as possible, cleaned to remove fungal particles, dried to 15% moisture or lower immediately to stop fungal growth, and stored in an aerated environment at 13-14% moisture between 35 and 40 °F to stop the asexual reproduction and spread of the fungus. These cultural controls can greatly decrease yield loss. C. herbarum needs an opening to infect its host, so cultural controls that prevent kernels from getting wounded would prevent infection of new plants. Insecticides can be used timely to chemically control corn earworms and European corn borers that damage kernels, allowing for inoculum to get inside. Also, combines should be sanitized and properly adjusted to minimize damage to kernels during harvest. Another less effective way to manage what percentage of the crop is infected is by planting resistant varieties and discarding the most susceptible ones. However, it is worth mentioning that no hybrid is resistant to all ear-rotting fungi and resistant varieties aren't widely available so even though a strain may be resistant to Cladosporium ear rot, it may be at risk of infection by another ear-rotting fungus. More husk coverage and stronger seed coats also make the host harder to infect in the first place. Crop rotation would likely be an effective cultural control method of eliminating the pathogen, but it would require all corn growers in a county to comply in order for there to be any significant impact on inoculum levels. If all corn growers weren't in sync with the crop rotations, spores from nearby fields would simply be carried by wind into other fields and keep inoculum levels from dropping to reasonable levels. == References == Category:Maize diseases ","title":"Cladosporium ear rot"},{"id":"56045434","text":"The C.J.

It was a low-budget affair with no well-known actors cast. Lead Ettore Elio Aricò, who had appeared in a previous film of Polselli's, provided most of the money for the film himself on the condition that he was cast as the protagonist . Although the opening credits state that the film was shot at Cave Film Studio in Rome, it was predominantly shot around Isarco Ravaioli's home. ==Release== Mania was released theatrically in Italy on 24 August 1974, where it was distributed by RCR. Louis Paul described Mania as a \\"seldom-seen thriller\\". Polselli stated the lack of availability was due to Aricò's dissatisfaction with the distribution which led him to take the film out of circulation. Paul also mentioned that it was rumoured to have been released on home video with hardcore pornography sequences added.

She made six voyages as an East Indiaman for the British East India Company (EIC). Her fourth voyage (in 1796–1798) was particularly notable as she participated in an encounter between six Indiamen and six French frigates in which the Indiamen succeeded in bluffing the French into withdrawing. During that voyage she also survived several typhoons. Her owners sold her in 1803 and her subsequent deployment and fate is currently unknown. ==Career== EIC voyage #1 (1788–1789): Captain Joseph Elliott sailed from Portsmouth on 5 April 1788, bound for Madras and China.

On 28 January 1797 the Indiamen had sailed through the Bali Strait in a squall and were off Java when they encountered six French frigates. Farquharson proceeded to organize a bluff. To give the impression that the convoy consisted of the powerful ships of the line that the Indiamen resembled, Farquharson ordered his ships to advance in line of battle. The French retreated, convinced they were facing a superior force. Actually, the French outgunned the East Indiamen both in terms of the number of guns and the weight of shot per gun. The Indiamen sailed east and then up towards China. On 1 February the Fleet encountered a strong gale with violent squalls and rain. Boddam almost wrecked on the Scheidam Rocks; the storm did wreck Ocean. Boddam arrived at Whampoa on 8 April 1797. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 11 May.

It was released as a single by Pony Canyon on August 24, 1988. It was used in the Kanebo Cosmetics televised ad campaign of fall 1988, for which the catchphrase was \\"n... Iroppoi\\". Kudo made her first appearance on the 39th Kōhaku Uta Gassen and performed \\"Mugon... Iroppoi\\" for the Red team. The song was nominated for the Grand Prix at the 30th Japan Record Awards. ==Background== The track was written by Miyuki Nakajima and Tsugutoshi Gotō. It was composed in the key of B major and set to a tempo of 140 beats per minute. Kudo's vocals span from B3 to B4. Lyrically, Nakajima cheekily describes a bashful protagonist struggling to profess her feelings to the object of her affection, whose attempts at seduction are foiled by her cowardly silence, and pondering if \\"tomorrow will be the day I summon up the courage to finally glance your way\\". ==Critical reception== \\"Mugon... Iroppoi\\" is noted for perfectly capturing the definitive kayōkyoku sound of the late 1980s. Nakajima and Gotō were praised for crafting a light pop song filled with pathos that has since become emblematic of its era. ==Cover versions== In 2005, Ryoko Shiraishi, who voiced the character of Suzuka Shibasaki on the drama CD series Mone, recorded a cover of the song in character for the compilation album Monthly Mone Vocal Collection Vol. 1. In 2007, a cover of the song was included on Hitomi Kitamura's EP, Hitomi ni Dokkin': Yasashiku Mitsumete. Yūko Minaguchi of the LovePlus dating sim recorded a cover of the song in character as Nene Anegasaki for the cover album Utau LovePlus, released in 2011. The song was also covered by Miho Arakawa on her Trillion Starlights EP. Sumire Uesaka covered the song for her 2014 album Uesaka Sumire Presents 80-nendai Idol Kayō Ketteiban. Nana Mizuki recorded a cover in character as Moka Akashiya from the anime Rosario + Vampire for the compilation album Rosario + Vampire: Idol Cover Best (2009). Mizuki also performed a live duet of the song with Kudo in 2014 on the Fuji TV program Music Fair. \\"Mugon... Iroppoi\\" was covered by Hiro Shimono as part of the Shizuka Kudo-as-sung-by male voice actors tribute album, Shizuka Kudo Tribute, released in 2017. ==Chart performance== \\"Mugon... Iroppoi\\" entered the Oricon Singles Chart at number two, selling 121,000 copies. It peaked at number one and charted for 27 consecutive weeks, becoming Kudo's longest- charting single of her career. It is her second consecutive number-one single, following \\"Fu-ji-tsu\\", and first to break the half a million total sales mark. The song was the second best-selling single of September 1988 and ranked at number three on the monthly Oricon Singles Chart for the month of October 1988.

Records from the Korea Labor Institute show that up to 10.4% of Korea’s population was unemployed in 1963.Hur, J. J. (2013). Korea’s Active Labor Market Policy: Its Birth, Establishment, and Development. Korea Labor Institute, Seoul. Additionally, Korea’s largest exports at the time were shoes, wigs, and plywood: all items that are produced through low skilled labor. Through the 1970s, the transfer of workers from the majority agrarian population into urban light industry provided a steady source of labor for Korean firms. Additionally, the constant need for low to medium skilled work gave workers an unwritten job security. Most workers enjoyed the benefits of proper notification and a chance to challenge unfair dismissal. This system continued well into the 1990s, by which point the Miracle on the Han River had caused miraculous levels of economic growth. The Korean market, by this point, was dominated by large family-run conglomerates known as chaebols. The unemployment crisis faced by the nascent South Korea were the least of the nation’s concerns by the 1990s: studies report that by 1997, only 2.5% of Koreans were unemployed. However, the sharp downturn the Korean economy experienced later that year during the Asian Economic Crisis proved the need for an active labor market policy and marked the end of labor elasticity and the postwar economic miracle in Korea. == Establishment == The crisis continued into the new millennium and with it came the end of Korean industry giant Daewoo and other prominent chaebols. As such, the nation experienced heavy spikes in unemployment, rising to near 8.7% unemployment rate by February of 1999. The D.C based think tank, Brookings Institution states that an 8.7% employment rate in Korea is similar, in intensity, to a 13% unemployment rate in other OECD nations. This is attributed to the weakness of Korean social services and the lack of women in the labor force to support unemployed husbands. In response to the national and regional crisis, a tripartite commission under the Dae-jung government authored the first active labor market legislature in the Korean government. This included clauses that weakened unemployment protection. However, legislature like the Dispatched Worker’s Act created new, temporary, short- term jobs for workers who had been laid off or out of work. Social expenditure under this commission's policy accounted for 4.8% of the total budget between 1997 and 2003, compared to 2.3% between 1990 and 1996. This expansion led to the creation of what is classified as \\"non-regular labor\\" by the Korean government, which were originally meant to curb unemployment during the market recovery. The rise of these \\"non-regular\\" positions led to the birth of a polarizing insider-outsider structure in the Korean labor market.Cho, J., & Keum, J. (2009). DUALISM IN JOB STABILITY OF THE KOREAN LABOUR MARKET: THE IMPACT OF THE 1997 FINANCIAL CRISIS. Scholars commonly refer to this situation as labor market duality in Korea. == Unemployment benefits == * Unemployment benefits are primarily administered through employment insurance, which is one of the main four insurances in South Korea. * Unemployment Pay: designed to support the unemployed with monetary assistance so that they can maintain their financial stability until they can find another employment. Eligibility: # The unemployed must have accumulated at least 180 working hours within the past 180 days prior to unemployment. # Involuntary employment due to the employer's management circumstance. # Unemployment status despite with willingness to work, while actively searching for reemployment. The duration of the benefit can be extended to 240 days depending on the age and the duration of the beneficiary's unemployment insurance status. * Education and training Opportunities for Unemployed: Employment Insurance pays for unemployed workers' education fee if the beneficiary voluntarily applies to a training program for the purpose of seeking reemployment. It is designed to assist the beneficiary in finding reemployment by providing an opportunity to develop their job-related skills. Furthermore, Employment Insurance works in conjunction with civilian vocational training programs and Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry. == Vocational training and education opportunities == * The government provides training programs for free in the industries that are expected to grow and deemed strategically in demand in the future. * \\"Learning for Tomorrow\\" Program: It provides an opportunity for the unemployed to obtain vocational skills development. * Low-interest loans up to 2,000 Korean won per month at the rate of 1% are offered while in such programs to ensure the trainees can fully participate in the training programs. == References == # http://www.moel-contents.co.kr/jobstability/index.html # https://www.oecd.org/employment/activation.htm # https://www.ei.go.kr/ei/eih/eg/pb/pbPersonBnef/retrievePb0100Info.do # http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE06377137 Category:Economy of South Korea ","title":"Active labor market policy in South Korea"},{"id":"56045817","text":"Osborne is a railway point and unincorporated place in geographic Osborne Township in the Unorganized North Part of Nipissing District in Northeastern Ontario, Canada.

Santhanam was an Indian stage and film actor, script writer and film lyricist who worked mainly in Tamil films. == Career == He was a teacher at Madurai Sri Mangala Bala Gana Sabha training young boys in dramatics. He was known as a strict disciplinarian. He punished erring boys beating them with a cane, sometimes chasing the running boys. One of his students became a renowned actor later who acknowledged to his friends that it was due to the discipline of his tutor he was able to reach heights. The actor is Sivaji Ganesan. Later Santhanam has done minor character roles in which Sivaji Ganesan featured as the hero. This information has been recorded by writer Aroordas in his biography.  As an actor  He is a character artiste and has featured in more than 100 films. In Pasamalar, he featured as Rajaratnam, a village senior who arranges the marriage of Sivaji Ganesan with M. N. Rajam. \\"Ahaa Enna Porutham\\" is a hit song from the film Ragasiya Police 115. In between the verses one can hear a commanding voice asking \\"Ange ennamma saththam?\\" (What is the noise there?). The voice is of Santhanam, who featured as Dhanapal Muthaliar (a filmmaker), father of Neela (Jayalalithaa) in the film. He featured as the father of M. G. Ramachandran in the film Aasai Mugam.  As a Lyricist  During the 1950s, Tamil Cinema had a number of classic lyricists who enriched the films with their variety of songs. Udumalai Narayana Kavi and Pattukkottai Kalyanasundaram wrote leftist oriented songs. A. Maruthakasi specialised in agricultural songs. Ku. Ma. Balasubramaniam wrote melodious songs. Kannadasan wrote on life and philosophy. Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass wrote songs that appealed to the common man. Santhanam made his mark by writing songs with rhythmic flow known in Tamil as Santham. A classic example of his \\"santham\\" song is \\"Thamizh Maalai Thanai Chooduvaal\\" from the film Ambikapathy. The sequence is: a poet takes up a challenge thrown by the King to sing 100 songs without referring to earthly pleasures, in order to win his daughter, the princess. Practically, in a film, it is impossible to sing 100 songs at a stretch. Santhanam wrote five songs for this scene. It was shown on screen using the running notation method. The fifth song becomes the 99th song. The poet gets excited. He sings the last five lines of the last verse in one breath. The word flow was such that it made the audience spellbound. This song is said to be the stamp song of Santhanam. Music director Ilaiyaraaja once said that he got the inspiration for his song \\"Vaa Vennilla\\" from the film Mella Thirandhathu Kadhavu (1986) was a song written by Santhanam – \\"Vaan Meedhile Inba Thaen Maari Peyudhe\\" from the film Chandirani (1953).

Albert Peter Low, in 1884 and 1895, and Henry O'Sullivan, the same year, use the spellings Lake Obatigoman (1884), Lake Obatogaman (1884), Lake Obatagoman (1895) and Lake Obatagomau (1895). The 1904 Fifth Report of the Geographic Board of Canada, published in Ottawa, 1905, page 46, states: \\"Obatogamau; Lake, Chibougamau Lake, Abitibi District, Que.\\". Of Cree origin, the term obatogamau means \\"lake with multiple straits or constricted by wood, vegetation\\". In 1910, the Hudson's Bay Company built on the eastern shore of Lake La Dauversière a cabin that will become over the years a place of storage. Finally this cabin was deserted. Originally known as \\"Lac-Obatogamau Deposit\\", this name will be standardized in the form of \\"Lac-Obatogamau Deposit\\", as a locality, in 1988. This set of lakes is dotted with hundreds of islands most of which are still unnamed. The largest is Weaver Island; this denomination is in honor of Kenneth Weaver, pilot of the military aviation during the Second World War and friend of the geologist Paul Imbault, responsible for an expedition to this region in 1950. On this occasion, the geologist has assigned names for the different parts of this body of water are the lakes La Dauversière and Le Royer, named after the township named in honor of Jerome Le Royer of La Dauversière, one of the founders of the Compagnie de Saint-Sulpice, Lakes Verneuil and Chevrier Lake), commemorating Jean-Jacques Olier of Verneuil and Pierre Chevrier, Baron de Fancamp, two members of this company and Lake Holmes, in memory of Stanley Holmes, one of the assistants of geologist Imbault.Source: Names and places of Quebec, work of the \\"Commission de toponymie du Québec\\" published in 1994 and 1996 under the form of a printed illustrated dictionary, and under that of a CD-ROM produced by the company Micro-Intel, in 1997, from this dictionary.

He was the son of Lucius Aemilius Mamercus, consul in 484, 478, and 473, and the grandson of a Mamercus Aemilius. ==Biography== In 470, Mamercus was elected consul with Lucius Valerius Potitus Publicola as colleague. The political situation in Rome was strained, the tribunes of the plebs continued to demand that land be distributed equally to the people. Livy states that Mamercus argued in favour of land distributions to the plebs. Tribunes Marcus Duillius and Gnaeus Siccius prosecuted Appius Claudius Sabinus, who was bitterly opposed to their legislation that distributed land to the people, however he died before the proceedings ended.Livy II, 61; III, 1 The Aequi and the Sabines, taking advantage of the internal conflict at Rome, made raids into Roman territory. Potitus was sent to fight the Aequi, while Mamercus fought a campaign against the Sabines. The Sabines confined themselves to their camp and would not engage the Roman army. Mamercus laid waste the Sabine countryside, and also the villages, prompting the Sabines to come forth to stop him. An uncertain battle was fought, and both sides retreated, however the war continued in following years.Livy II, 62-64Dionysius of Halicarnassus IX, 51-55 Mamercus was elected consul a second time in 467, with Quintus Fabius Vibulanus as his colleague. Mamercus again supported the agrarian law of the plebeian tribunes in favor of a distribution of land to the people and was confronted by the conservative senators. With his colleague Vibulanus, he successfully bought an end to the conflict by passing a law that the lands of the Volsci at the new Roman colony of Antium be distributed. Three commissioners were named for the purpose of dividing the lands.Livy III, 1.2-5Dionysius of Halicarnassus IX, 59.1-3 Mamercus launched another military expedition against the Sabines along with his colleague who fought the Aequi.

Bos was the only woman named to represent the Netherlands in skeleton at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, where she finished eighth. == Notable results == Bos's first official result in international competition was a bobsleigh qualification race for the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics, held the previous November at the Olympic Sliding Centre Innsbruck, in which she and brakewoman Mandy Groot finished fourth. In three subsequent qualification races (with Groot and Sanne Dekker trading off brakewoman duties), she finished second, earning a qualifying spot to the 2012 games. At the games, Bos and Groot earned a bronze medal, behind a British sled and the other Dutch team (see Bobsleigh at the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics). Bos and Groot finished 13th later that month at the Bobsleigh Junior World Championships, also at the Innsbruck track, again behind their Dutch teammates. After a string of poor performances in the 2012–13 season, including five non-results on the Europe and North American Cup tours, Bos switched to skeleton racing for the 2013–14 season.

Members of the Pomona football team from the class of 1907 Pomona College's first intercollegiate sports teams were formed in 1895. The college was one of the three founding members of SCIAC in 1914, and its football team played in the inaugural game at the Los Angeles Coliseum in 1923, losing to the University of Southern California Trojans. Between 1946 and 1956, Pomona joined with Claremont Men's College (CMC) to compete as Pomona-Claremont. In 1970, Pomona began competing with Pitzer College (then seven years old) on an interim basis, and the arrangement became permanent two years later.

The bird is a large ground-dweller native to the western United States (although not Southern California), and is distinguished by its long, pointed tail and complex lek mating system. It is named after the sagebrush on which it feeds. Pomona-Pitzer is the only team in the world to use the Sagehen as a mascot, and it is often noted for its goofiness. Rather than in the grouse's natural brown and white colors, the mascot is rendered in the team's official blue and orange colors. The precise origin of the nickname is unknown. Pomona competed under a variety of names in its early years, including \\"the Blue and White\\" and \\"the Huns\\". The first known appearance of \\"Sagehens\\" was in a 1913 issue of The Student Life newspaper, and in 1918 it became the sole nickname. Later Pomona-Claremont began using it, and it is now the nickname for the combined Pomona-Pitzer team. The first known reference to \\"Cecil\\" was made in the 1946 Metate (Pomona's yearbook). ==Rivalry== The Sagehens' primary rival is the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Stags and Athenas, the joint team of the three other undergraduate Claremont Colleges.

They are generated by two involutions on embeddings, surface duality and Petrie duality, and have the group structure of the symmetric group on three elements. They are named for Stephen E. Wilson, who published them for regular maps in 1979; they were extended to all cellular graph embeddings (embeddings all of whose faces are topological disks) by . The operations are: identity, duality, Petrie duality, Petrie dual of dual, dual of Petrie dual, and dual of Petrie dual of dual or equivalently Petrie dual of dual of Petrie dual. Together they constitute the group S3. These operations be characterized algebraically as the only outer automorphisms of certain group-theoretic representations of embedded graphs. Via their action on dessins d'enfants, they can be used to study the absolute Galois group of the rational numbers. One can also define corresponding operations on the edges of an embedded graph, the partial dual and partial Petrie dual, such that performing the same operation on all edges simultaneously is equivalent to taking the surface dual or Petrie dual. These operations generate a larger group, the ribbon group, acting on the embedded graphs.

Approximately 80% of the population is reliant on subsistence agriculture, so a large percentage of food energy and protein consumed in Papua New Guinea is produced locally, while the balance is imported. The staple foods in Papua New Guinea includes root crops, bananas, and sago. Papua New Guinea's diet is largely vegetarian, especially in the Gulf and Highlands regions. Mumu is a traditional method of cooking large quantities of food throughout Papua New Guinea, as well as other islands in the Pacific. It consists of an earth oven that is filled with hot coal or stones, that may be placed in different orientations, and subsequently cooked for a lengthy period of time. Despite the presence of advent ovens in Papua New Guinea, mumu is still prevalent at household level. ==Beverages== Along with other islands in the western Pacific, kava is usually made into a drink by mixing the root of the crop with water. It is a popular and non-alcoholic beverage. Coffee is Papua New Guinea's second largest agricultural export, after oil palm, and is majorly grown in the Highlands Region.

His predecessor Captain Maconochie had regarded his prisoners as human beings and permitted them to have small garden plots in which they could grow sweet potatoes and other vegetables. Maconochie also shortened hours of labour, granted holidays for good behaviour and provided saucepans and kettles for prisoners to cook food. Over a period of two years, Major Childs withdrew those privileges, abolishing private garden plots, lengthening daily hours of work and ending holidays for good behaviour. He cut down the prisoners' rations and, on 1 July, 1846, prohibited personal cooking—ordering all kettles and saucepans held by prisoners to be handed in. ==Rebellion== Convict buildings at the former jail on Norfolk Island.

The Italian Fascists imposed totalitarian rule and crushed political and intellectual opposition, while promoting economic modernization, traditional social values and a rapprochement with the Roman Catholic Church. According to Payne (1996), \\"[the] Fascist government passed through several relatively distinct phases\\". The first phase (1922–1925) was nominally a continuation of the parliamentary system, albeit with a \\"legally-organized executive dictatorship\\". The second phase (1925–1929) was \\"the construction of the Fascist dictatorship proper\\". The third phase (1929–1934) was with less activism. The fourth phase (1935–1940) was characterized by an aggressive foreign policy: the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, which was launched from Eritrea and Somaliland; confrontations with the League of Nations, leading to sanctions; growing economic autarky; invasion of Albania; and the signing of the Pact of Steel. The fifth phase (1940–1943) was World War II itself which ended in military defeat, while the sixth and final phase (1943–1945) was the rump Salò Government under German control.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914–1945 (1996) p 212 Italy was a leading member of the Axis powers in World War II, battling on several fronts with initial success. However, after the German-Italian defeat in Africa and Soviet Union and the subsequent Allied landings in Sicily, King Victor Emmanuel III overthrew and arrested Mussolini, and the Fascist Party in areas (south of Rome) controlled by the Allied invaders was shut down. The new government signed an armistice with the Allies on September 1943. Nazi Germany, with Fascists' help, seized control of the northern half of Italy and freed Mussolini, setting up the Italian Social Republic, a collaborationist puppet state still led by Mussolini and his Fascist loyalists. Italian resistance to Nazi German occupation and Italian Fascist collaborators manifested in the Four days of Naples, while the Allies organized some Italian troops in the south into the Italian Co-belligerent Army, which fought alongside the Allies for the rest of the war. A smaller number of Italian troops, still loyal to Mussolini and his RSI, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the National Republican Army. From this point on, the country descended in civil war, and a large Italian resistance movement fought a guerrilla war against the German and RSI forces. Mussolini was captured and killed on 28 April 1945 by the Italian resistance, and hostilities ended the next day. Shortly after the war, civil discontent led to the 1946 institutional referendum on whether Italy would remain a monarchy or become a republic. Italians decided to abandon the monarchy and form the Italian Republic, the present-day Italian state. == Culture and society == After rising to power, the Fascist regime of Italy set a course to becoming a one-party state and to integrate Fascism into all aspects of life. A totalitarian state was officially declared in the Doctrine of Fascism of 1935: With the concept of totalitarianism, Mussolini and the Fascist regime set an agenda of improving Italian culture and society based on ancient Rome, personal dictatorship and some futurist aspects of Italian intellectuals and artists.Pauley, Bruce F (2003) Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini: Totalitarianism in the Twentieth Century Italy, Wheeling: Harlan Davidson, Inc., p. 107. Under Fascism, the definition of the Italian nationality rested on a militarist foundation and the Fascist's \\"new man\\" ideal in which loyal Italians would rid themselves of individualism and autonomy and see themselves as a component of the Italian state and be prepared to sacrifice their lives for it.Gentile, Emilio. The Struggle For Modernity Nationalism Futurism and Fascism (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2003), p. 87. Under such a totalitarian society, only Fascists would be considered \\"true Italians\\" and membership and endorsement of the Fascist Party was necessary for people to gain \\"Complete Citizenship\\", as those who did not swear allegiance to Fascism were banished from public life and could not gain employment.Gentile, p. 81. The Fascist government also reached out to Italians living overseas to endorse the Fascist cause and identify with Italy rather than their places of residence.Gentile, p. 146. Despite efforts to mould a new culture for fascism, Fascist Italy's efforts were not as drastic or successful in comparison to other one-party states like Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in creating a new culture.Pauley, p. 108. Mussolini's propaganda idolized him as the nation's saviour and the Fascist regime attempted to make him omnipresent in Italian society. Much of Fascism's appeal in Italy was based on the personality cult around Mussolini and his popularity. Mussolini's passionate oratory and personality cult was displayed at huge rallies and parades of his Blackshirts in Rome which served as an inspiration to Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany. The Fascist regime established propaganda in newsreels, radio broadcasting and a few feature films deliberately endorsing Fascism.Federico Caprotti, \\"Information management and fascist identity: newsreels in fascist Italy\\". Media history (2005) 11@3 pp: 177–191. In 1926, laws were passed to require that propaganda newsreels be shown prior to all feature films in cinemas.Pauley, p. 109. These newsreels were more effective in influencing the public than propaganda films or radio, as few Italians had radio receivers at the time. Fascist propaganda was widely present in posters and state-sponsored art. However, artists, writers and publishers were not strictly controlled: they were only censored if they were blatantly against the state. There was a constant emphasis on the masculinity of the \\"new Italian\\", stressing aggression, virility, youth, speed and sport.Gigliola Gori, \\"Model of masculinity: Mussolini, the 'new Italian' of the Fascist era\\". International journal of the history of sport (1999) 16#4 pp: 27–61. Women were to attend to motherhood and stay out of public affairs.Lesley Caldwell, \\"Madri d'ltalia: Film and Fascist Concern with Motherhood\\". in Zygmunt G. Bara'nski and George N. Yannopoulos, eds. Women and Italy: Essays on Gender, Culture and History (1991) pp: 43–63. General elections were held in the form of a referendum on 24 March 1929. By this time, the country was a single-party state with the National Fascist Party (PNF) as the only legally permitted party. Mussolini used a referendum to confirm a fascist single-party list. The list put forward was ultimately approved by 98.43% of voters.Italy, 24 May 1929: Fascist single list Direct Democracy The universal male suffrage, which was legal since 1912, was restricted to men who were members of a trade union or an association, to soldiers and to members of the clergy. Consequently, only 9.5 million people were able to vote.  Roman Catholic Church  Roman Catholic procession in Rome, 1931 In 1870 the newly formed Kingdom of Italy annexed the remaining Papal States, depriving the Pope of his temporal power. Relations with the Roman Catholic Church improved significantly during Mussolini's tenure. Despite earlier opposition to the Church, after 1922 Mussolini made an alliance with the Catholic Partito Popolare Italiano (Italian People's Party). In 1929, Mussolini and the papacy came to an agreement that ended a standoff that reached back to 1860 and had alienated the Church from the Italian government. The Orlando government had begun the process of reconciliation during World War I and the Pope furthered it by cutting ties with the Christian Democrats in 1922.Smith, Italy, pp 40–443. Mussolini and the leading Fascists were anti-clericals and atheists, but they recognized the opportunity of warmer relations with Italy's large Roman Catholic element. The Lateran Accord of 1929 was a treaty that recognized the Pope as the head of the new micro-nation of Vatican City within Rome, which gave it independent status and made the Vatican an important hub of world diplomacy. The Concordat of 1929 made Roman Catholicism the sole religion of the State (although other religions were tolerated), paid salaries to priests and bishops, recognized religious marriages (previously couples had to have a civil ceremony) and brought religious instruction into the public schools. In turn, the bishops swore allegiance to the Italian Fascist régime, which had a veto power over their selection. A third agreement paid the Vatican 1.75 billion lira (about $100 million) for the seizures of Church property since 1860. The Catholic Church was not officially obligated to support the Fascist régime and the strong differences remained, but the seething hostility ended. The Church especially endorsed foreign policies such as support for the anti-communist side in the Spanish Civil War and support for the Italian invasion of Ethiopia. Friction continued over the Catholic Action (Azione Cattolica) youth network, which Mussolini wanted to merge into his Fascist youth group.Kenneth Scott Latourette, Christianity In a Revolutionary Age: A History of Christianity in the 19th and 20th Century: Vol. 4 (The 20th Century In Europe, 1961) pp 32–35, 153, 156, 371. In 1931, Pope Pius XI issued the encyclical Non abbiamo bisogno (\\"We Have No Need\\") that denounced the regime's persecution of the Church in Italy and condemned \\"pagan worship of the state\\".  Clerical fascism  Vatican delegation prior to signing the Lateran Treaty The Papal spiritual rule over Italy was restored by the Italian Fascist régime (albeit on a greatly diminished scale) in 1929 as head of the Vatican City state; under Mussolini's dictatorship, Roman Catholicism became the State religion of Fascist Italy. In March 1929, a nationwide plebiscite was held to publicly endorse the Treaty. Opponents were intimidated by the Fascist régime: the Catholic Action instructed Italian Roman Catholics to vote for Fascist candidates to represent them in positions in churches and Mussolini claimed that \\"no\\" votes were of those \\"few ill-advised anti-clericals who refuse to accept the Lateran Pacts\\".Pollard 2014, The Vatican and Italian Fascism, 1929-32: A Study in Conflict, p. 49. Nearly 9 million Italians voted or 90 percent of the registered electorate and only 136,000 voted \\"no\\".Pollard 2014, The Vatican and Italian Fascism, 1929-32: A Study in Conflict, p. 61. The Lateran Treaty remains in place to this day. In 1938, the Italian Racial Laws and the Manifesto of Race were promulgated by the Fascist régime, enforced to outlaw and persecute both Italian Jews and Protestant Christians, especially Evangelicals and Pentecostals. In Jan. 1939, The Jewish National Monthly reports \\"the only bright spot in Italy has been the Vatican, where fine humanitarian statements by the Pope have been issuing regularly\\". When Mussolini's anti-Semitic decrees began depriving Jews of employment in Italy, Pius XI, on his own initiative, admitted Professor Vito Volterra, a famous Italian Jewish mathematician, into the Pontifical Academy of Science.See 'Scholars at the Vatican,' Commonweal, December 4, 1942, pp.187-188) Despite Mussolini's close alliance with Hitler's Germany, Italy did not fully adopt Nazism's genocidal ideology towards the Jews. The Nazis were frustrated by the Italian authorities' refusal to co-operate in the round-ups of Jews, and no Jews were deported prior to the formation of the Italian Social Republic following the Armistice of Cassibile. In the Italian-occupied Independent State of Croatia, German envoy Siegfried Kasche advised Berlin that Italian forces had \\"apparently been influenced\\" by Vatican opposition to German anti- Semitism. As anti-Axis feeling grew in Italy, the use of Vatican Radio to broadcast papal disapproval of race murder and anti-Semitism angered the Nazis. Mussolini was overthrown in July 1943, the Germans moved to occupy Italy, and commenced a round-up of Jews. Thousands of Italian Jews and a small number of Protestants died in the Nazi concentration camps.  Antisemitism  Until Mussolini's alliance with Adolf Hitler, he had always denied any antisemitism within the Fascist Party. In an early 1920s, Mussolini wrote an article which stated that Fascism would never elevate a \\"Jewish Question\\" and that \\"Italy knows no antisemitism and we believe that it will never know it\\" and then elaborated \\"let us hope that Italian Jews will continue to be sensible enough so as not to give rise to antisemitism in the only country where it has never existed\\". In 1932 during a conversation Emil Ludwig, Mussolini described antisemitism as a \\"German vice\\" and stated: \\"There was 'no Jewish Question' in Italy and could not be one in a country with a healthy system of government\\".Christopher Hibbert, Benito Mussolini (1975), p. 99 On several occasions, Mussolini spoke positively about Jews and the Zionist movement.Zimmerman, p.160 Mussolini had initially rejected Nazi racism, especially the idea of a master race, as \\"arrant nonsense, stupid and idiotic\\".Hibbert, p. 98 On the issue of antisemitism, the Fascists were divided on what to do, especially with the rise of Hitler in Germany. A number of Fascist members were Jewish and Mussolini himself did not personally believe in antisemitism, but to appease Hitler antisemitism within the Fascist Party steadily increased. In 1936, Mussolini made his first written denunciation of Jews by claiming that antisemitism had only arisen because Jews had become too predominant in the positions of power of countries and claimed that Jews were a \\"ferocious\\" tribe who sought to \\"totally banish\\" Christians from public life.Sarti, p. 199. In 1937, Fascist member Paolo Orano criticized the Zionist movement as being part of British foreign policy which designed to secure British hold of the area without respecting the Christian and Islamic presence in Palestine. On the matter of Jewish Italians, Orano said that they \\"should concern themselves with nothing more than their religion\\" and not bother boasting of being patriotic Italians.Sarti, p. 200. The major source of friction between National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy was Italy's stance on Jews. In his early years as Fascist leader, while Mussolini harbored racial stereotypes of Jews, he did not hold a firm stance on Jews and his official stances oscillated and shifted to meet the political demands of the various factions of the Fascist movement, rather than having any concrete stance.Albert S. Lindemann. Esau's Tears: Modern Anti-Semitism and the Rise of the Jews. Cambridge University Press, 1997. Pp. 466–467. Of the 117 original members of the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento founded on 23 March 1919, five were Jewish.William I. Brustein. Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe Before the Holocaust. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2003. P. 327. Since the movement's early years, there were a small number of prominent openly antisemitic Fascists such as Roberto Farinacci.Peter Neville. Mussolini. Pp. 117. There were also prominent Fascists who completely rejected antisemitism, such as Italo Balbo, who lived in Ferrara, which had a substantial Jewish community that was widely accepted and suffered few antisemitic incidents.Claudio G. Segrè. Italo Balbo: A Fascist Life. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, USA: University of California Press, 1999. P. 346. Mussolini initially had no antisemitic statements in his policies.Albert S. Lindemann. Esau's Tears: Modern Anti- Semitism and the Rise of the Jews. Cambridge University Press, 1997. P. 466. However, in response to his observation of large numbers of Jews amongst the Bolsheviks and claims (that were later confirmed to be true) that the Bolsheviks and Germany (that Italy was fighting in World War I) were politically connected, Mussolini made antisemitic statements involving the Bolshevik-German connection as being \\"an unholy alliance between Hindenburg and the synagogue\\". Mussolini came to believe rumors that Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin was of Jewish descent. Mussolini attacked the Jewish banker Giuseppe Toeplitz of Banca Commerciale Italiana by claiming that he was a German agent and traitor of Italy.Wiley Feinstein. The Civilization of the Holocaust in Italy: Poets, Artists, Saints, Anti-Semites. Rosemont Publish & Printing Corp., 2003. P. 201. In an article in Il Popolo d'Italia in June 1919, Mussolini wrote a highly antisemitic analysis on the situation in Europe involving Bolshevism following the October Revolution, the Russian Civil War and war in Hungary involving the Hungarian Soviet Republic. In June 1919, Mussolini wrote on Il Popolo d'Italia: This statement by Mussolini on a Jewish-Bolshevik-plutocratic connection and conspiracy was met with opposition in the Fascist movement, resulting in Mussolini responding to this opposition amongst his supporters by abandoning and reversing this stance shortly afterwards in 1919. In reversing his stance due to opposition to it, Mussolini no longer expressed his previous assertion that Bolshevism was Jewish, but warned that—due to the large numbers of Jews in the Bolshevik movement—the rise of Bolshevism in Russia would result in a ferocious wave of anti-Semitism in Russia. He then claimed that \\"anti-Semitism is foreign to the Italian people\\", but warned Zionists that they should be careful not to stir up antisemitism in \\"the only country where it has not existed\\". One of the Jewish financial supporters of the Fascist movement was Toeplitz, whom Mussolini had earlier accused of being a traitor during World War I.Wiley Feinstein. The Civilization of the Holocaust in Italy: Poets, Artists, Saints, Anti-Semites. Rosemont Publish & Printing Corp., 2003. Pp. 202. Early on there were prominent Jewish Italian Fascists such as Aldo Finzi, who was born of a mixed marriage of a Jewish and Christian Italian and was baptized as a Roman Catholic.Michele Sarfatti, Anne C. Tedeschi. The Jews in Mussolini's Italy: From Equality to Persecution. P. 202. Another prominent Jewish Italian Fascist was Ettore Ovazza, who was a vocal Italian nationalist and an opponent of Zionism in Italy.Jonathan Steinberg. All Or Nothing: The Axis and the Holocaust, 1941–1943. Pp. 220. 230 Italian Jews took part in the Fascists' March on Rome in 1922. In 1932, Mussolini made his private attitude about Jews known to the Austrian ambassador when discussing the issue of the antisemitism of Hitler, saying: \\"I have no love for the Jews, but they have great influence everywhere. It is better to leave them alone. Hitler's anti-Semitism has already brought him more enemies than is necessary\\". At the 1934 Montreux Fascist conference chaired by the Italian-led Comitati d'Azione per l'Universalita di Roma (CAUR) that sought to found a Fascist International, the issue of antisemitism was debated amongst various fascist parties, with some more favorable to it and others less favorable. Two final compromises were adopted, creating the official stance of the Fascist International: Italian Fascism adopted antisemitism in the late 1930s and Mussolini personally returned to invoke antisemitic statements as he had done earlier.Feinstein, p. 304. The Fascist regime used antisemitic propaganda for the Spanish Civil War from 1937 to 1938 that emphasized that Italy was supporting Spain's Nationalist forces against a \\"Jewish International\\". The Fascist regime's adoption of official antisemitic racial doctrine in 1938 met opposition from Fascist members including Balbo, who regarded antisemitism as having nothing to do with Fascism and staunchly opposed the antisemitic laws. In 1938, under pressure from Germany, Mussolini made the regime adopt a policy of antisemitism, which was extremely unpopular in Italy and in the Fascist Party itself. As a result of the laws, the Fascist regime lost its propaganda director, Margherita Sarfatti, who was Jewish and had been Mussolini's mistress. A minority of high-ranking Fascists were pleased with the antisemitic policy such as Roberto Farinacci, who claimed that Jews through intrigue had taken control key positions of finance, business and schools and he claimed that Jews sympathized with Ethiopia during Italy's war with it and that Jews had sympathized with Republican Spain during the Spanish Civil War.Sarti, p. 198. In 1938, Farinacci became the minister in charge of culture and adopted racial laws designed to prevent racial intermixing which included antisemitism. Until the armistice with the Allies in September 1943, the Italian Jewish community was protected from deportation to the German death camps in the east. With the armistice, Hitler took control of the German- occupied territory in the North and began an effort to liquidate the Jewish community under his control. Shortly after the entry of Italy into the war, numerous camps were established for the imprisonment of enemy aliens and Italians suspected to be hostile to the regime. In contrast to the brutality of the National Socialist-run camps, the Italian camps allowed families to live together and there was a broad program of social welfare and cultural activities. Antisemitism was unpopular throughout Italy, including within the Fascist Party. Once when a Fascist scholar protested to Mussolini about the treatment of his Jewish friends, Mussolini is reported to have said: \\"I agree with you entirely. I don't believe a bit in the stupid anti-Semitic theory. I am carrying out my policy entirely for political reasons\\".Hibbert, p. 110  Education  Propaganda poster of Mussolini The Fascist government endorsed a stringent education policy in Italy aiming at eliminating illiteracy, which was a serious problem in Italy at the time, as well as improving the allegiance of Italians to the state.Pauley, p. 117. To reduce drop-outs, the government changed the minimum age of leaving school from twelve to fourteen and strictly enforced attendance.Pauley, p. 117 The Fascist government's first minister of education from 1922 to 1924 Giovanni Gentile recommended that education policy should focus on indoctrination of students into Fascism and to educate youth to respect and be obedient to authority. In 1929, education policy took a major step towards being completely taken over by the agenda of indoctrination. In that year, the Fascist government took control of the authorization of all textbooks, all secondary school teachers were required to take an oath of loyalty to Fascism and children began to be taught that they owed the same loyalty to Fascism as they did to God. In 1933, all university teachers were required to be members of the National Fascist Party. From the 1930s to 1940s, Italy's education focused on the history of Italy displaying Italy as a force of civilization during the Roman era, displaying the rebirth of Italian nationalism and the struggle for Italian independence and unity during the Risorgimento. In the late 1930s, the Fascist government copied Nazi Germany's education system on the issue of physical fitness and began an agenda that demanded that Italians become physically healthy. Intellectual talent in Italy was rewarded and promoted by the Fascist government through the Royal Academy of Italy which was created in 1926 to promote and coordinate Italy's intellectual activity.Cannistraro, Philip V. (1982) Historical Dictionary of Fascist Italy, Westport, Conn.; London: Greenwood Press, , p. 474  Social welfare  A major success in social policy in Fascist Italy was the creation of the Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro (OND) or \\"National After- work Program\\" in 1925. The OND was the state's largest recreational organizations for adults.Pauley, p. 113. The Dopolavoro was so popular that by the 1930s all towns in Italy had a Dopolavoro clubhouse and the Dopolavoro was responsible for establishing and maintaining 11,000 sports grounds, over 6,400 libraries, 800 movie houses, 1,200 theaters and over 2,000 orchestras. Membership was voluntary and nonpolitical. In the 1930s, under the direction of Achille Starace, the OND became primarily recreational, concentrating on sports and other outings. It is estimated that by 1936 the OND had organized 80% of salaried workers.de Grazia, Victoria. The Culture of Consent: Mass Organizations of Leisure in Fascist Italy. Cambridge, 1981. Nearly 40% of the industrial workforce had been recruited into the Dopolavoro by 1939 and the sports activities proved popular with large numbers of workers. The OND had the largest membership of any of the mass Fascist organizations in Italy.Kallis, Aristotle, ed. (2003). The Fascism Reader, London: Routledge, pp. 391–395. The enormous success of the Dopolavoro in Fascist Italy prompted Nazi Germany to create its own version of the Dopolavoro, the Kraft durch Freude (KdF) or \\"Strength through Joy\\" program, which was even more successful than the Dopolavoro.Pauley, pp. 113–114 Another organization the Opera Nazionale Balilla (ONB) was widely popular and provided young people with access to clubs, dances, sports facilities, radios, concerts, plays, circuses and outdoor hikes at little or no cost. It sponsored tournaments and sports festivals.  Police state  Mussolini in Milan, 1930 For security of the regime, Mussolini advocated complete state authority and created the Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale (\\"National Security Volunteer Militia\\") in 1923, which are commonly referred to as \\"Blackshirts\\" for the color of their uniforms. Most of the Blackshirts were members from the Fasci di Combattimento. A secret police force called the Organizzazione di Vigilanza Repressione dell'Antifascismo (\\"Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism\\") or OVRA was created in 1927. It was led by Arturo Bocchini to crack down on opponents of the regime and Mussolini (there had been several near-miss assassination attempts on Mussolini's life in his early years in power). This force was effective, but unlike the Schutzstaffel (SS) in Germany or the NKVD of the Soviet Union, the OVRA caused far fewer deaths of political opponents. However, Fascists methods of repression were cruel which included physically forcing opponents of Fascism to swallow castor oil which would cause severe diarrhea and dehydration, leaving the victim in a painful and physically debilitated state which would sometimes result in death. To combat Italian organized crime, notably the Cosa Nostra in Sicilia and the 'Ndrangheta in Calabria, the Fascist government gave special powers in 1925 to Cesare Mori, the prefect of Palermo.Fabio Truzzolillo, \\"The 'Ndrangheta: the current state of historical research,\\" Modern Italy (Aug 2011) 16#3 pp 363–383. These powers gave him the ability to prosecute the Mafia, forcing many Mafiosi to flee abroad (many to the United States) or risk being jailed.Mafia Trial, Time, October 24, 1927 However, Mori was fired when he began to investigate Mafia links within the Fascist regime and was removed from his position in 1929, when the Fascist regime declared that the threat of the Mafia had been eliminated. Mori's actions weakened the Mafia, but did not destroy them. From 1929 to 1943, the Fascist regime completely abandoned its previously aggressive measures against the Mafia and the Mafiosi were left relatively undisturbed.  Women  The Fascists paid special attention to the role of women, from elite society women to factory workersPerry R. Willson, The Clockwork Factory: Women and Work in Fascist Italy (1994) and peasants.Perry R. Willson, Peasant Women and Politics in Fascist Italy: The Massaie Rurali (2002) Fascist leaders sought to \\"rescue\\" women from experiencing emancipation even as they trumpeted the advent of the \\"new Italian woman\\" (nuova italiana).Victoria De Grazia, How Fascism Ruled Women: Italy, 1922–1945 (1993) The policies revealed a deep conflict between modernity and traditional patriarchal authority, as Catholic, Fascist and commercial models of conduct competed to shape women's perceptions of their roles and their society at large. The Fascists celebrated violent \\"virilist\\" politics and exaggerated its machismo while also taxing celibate men to pay for child welfare programs. Italy's invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 and the resulting League of Nations sanctions shaped the tasks assigned to women within the Fascist Party. The empire and women's contribution to it became a core theme in Fascist propaganda. Women in the party were mobilized for the imperial cause both as producers and as consumers, giving them new prominence in the nation. The Fascist women's groups expanded their roles to cover such new tasks as running training courses on how to fight waste in housework. Young Italian women were prepared for a role in Italy's \\"place in the sun\\" through special courses created to train them for a future as colonial wives.Perry Willson, \\"Empire, Gender and the 'Home Front' in Fascist Italy,\\" Women's History Review, October 2007, Vol. 16 Issue 4, pp. 487–500. The government tried to achieve \\"alimentary sovereignty\\", or total self- sufficiency with regard to food supplies. Its new policies were highly controversial among a people who paid serious attention to their food. The goal was to reduce imports, support Italian agriculture and encourage an austere diet based on bread, polenta, pasta, fresh produce and wine. Fascist women's groups trained women in \\"autarkic cookery\\" to work around items no longer imported. Food prices climbed in the 1930s and dairy and meat consumption was discouraged, while increasing numbers of Italians turned to the black market. The policy demonstrated that Fascists saw food—and people's behavior generally—as strategic resources that could be manipulated regardless of traditions and tastes.Carol Helstosky, \\"Fascist food politics: Mussolini's policy of alimentary sovereignty, Journal of Modern Italian Studies March 2004, Vol. 9 Issue 1, pp. 1–26. == Economy == Mussolini and the Fascist Party promised Italians a new economic system known as corporatism, an outgrowth of socialism into a new economic system where the means of production were nominally left in the hands of the civil sector, but directed and controlled by the State. In 1935, the Doctrine of Fascism was published under Mussolini's name, although it was most likely written by Giovanni Gentile. It described the role of the state in the economy under corporatism. By this time, Fascism had been drawn more towards the support of market forces being dominant over state intervention. A passage from the Doctrine of Fascism read: Fascists claimed that this system would be egalitarian and traditional at the same time. The economic policy of corporatism quickly faltered: the left-wing elements of the Fascist manifesto were opposed by industrialists and landowners who supported the party because it pledged to defend Italy from socialism. As a result, corporatist policy became dominated by the industries. Initially, economic legislation mostly favoured the wealthy industrial and agrarian classes by allowing privatization, liberalization of rent laws, tax cuts and administrative reform. However, economic policy changed drastically following the Matteotti Crisis where Mussolini began pushing for a totalitarian state. In 1926, the Syndical laws (also known as the Rocco laws) were passed, organizing the economy into 12 separate employer and employee unions.Sarti, 1968. The unions were largely state-controlled and were mainly used to suppress opposition and reward political loyalty. While the Fascist unions could not protect workers from all economic consequences, they were responsible for the handling of social security benefits, claims for severance pay and could sometimes negotiate contracts that benefited workers.Pauley, p. 85. After the Great Depression hit the world economy in 1929, the Fascist regime followed other nations in enacting protectionist tariffs and attempted to set direction for the economy. In the 1930s, the government increased wheat production and made Italy self-sufficient for wheat, ending imports of wheat from Canada and the United States.Pauley, p. 86 However, the transfer of agricultural land to wheat production reduced the production of vegetables and fruit. Despite improving production for wheat, the situation for peasants themselves did not improve, as 0.5% of the Italian population (usually wealthy) owned 42 percent of all agricultural land in ItalyPauley, p. 87 and income for peasants did not increase while taxes did increase. The Depression caused unemployment to rise from 300,000 to 1 million in 1933.Pauley, p. 88 It also caused a 10 percent drop in real income and a fall in exports. Italy fared better than most western nations during the Depression: its welfare services did reduce the impact of the Depression. Its industrial growth from 1913 to 1938 was even greater than that of Germany for the same time period. Only the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian nations had a higher industrial growth during that period. Italy's colonial expansion into Ethiopia in 1936 proved to have a negative impact on Italy's economy. The budget of the colony of Italian East Africa in the 1936–1937 fiscal year requested from Italy 19.136 billion lire to be used to create the necessary infrastructure for the colony.Cannistraro, Philip V. 1982. Historical Dictionary of Fascist Italy. Westport, Connecticut; London, England: Greenwood Press. Pp. 5 At the time, Italy's entire revenue that year was only 18.581 billion lire.Cannistraro, p. 5. == Technology and modernization == In 1933, Italy made multiple technological achievements. The Fascist government spent large sums of money on technological projects such as the construction of the new Italian ocean liner SS Rex which in 1933 made a transatlantic sea crossing record of four days. as well as funding the development of the Macchi M.C.72 seaplane which became the world's fastest seaplane in 1933 and retained the title in 1934. In 1933, Fascist government member Italo Balbo, who was also an aviator, made a transatlantic flight in a flying boat to Chicago for the World's Fair known as the Century of Progress. The flight symbolized the power of Fascist leadership and the industrial and technological progress the state had made under Fascist direction. == Foreign policy == Stephen Lee identifies three major themes in Mussolini's foreign-policy. The first was a continuation of the foreign-policy objectives of the preceding Liberal regime. Liberal Italy had allied itself with Germany and Austria and had great ambitions in the Balkans and North Africa. It had been badly defeated in Ethiopia in 1896, when there was a strong demand for seizing that country. Second was a profound disillusionment after the heavy losses of the First World War. The small territorial gains from Austria were not enough to compensate for the war's terrible costs and other countries, especially Poland and Yugoslavia, received much more and Italy felt cheated. Third was Mussolini's promise to restore the pride and glory of the old Roman Empire. Mussolini promised to revive Italy's status as a Great Power in Europe, carving out a \\"New Roman Empire\\". Mussolini promised that Italy would dominate the Mediterranean Sea. In propaganda, the Fascist government used the originally ancient Roman term \\"Mare Nostrum\\" (Latin for \\"Our Sea\\") to refer to the Mediterranean Sea. The Fascist regime increased funding and attention to military projects and began plans to create an Italian Empire in Northern and Eastern Africa and reclaim dominance in the Mediterranean Sea and Adriatic Sea. The Fascists launched wars to conquer Dalmazia, Albania and Greece for the Italian Empire. The Italian Empire in 1940  Africa  Colonial efforts in Africa began in the 1920s, as civil war plagued Italian North Africa (Africa Settentrionale Italiana, or ASI) as the Arab population there refused to accept Italian colonial government. Mussolini sent Marshal Rodolfo Graziani to lead a punitive pacification campaign against the Arab nationalists. Omar Mukhtar led the Arab resistance movement. After a much-disputed truce on 3 January 1928, the Fascist policy in Libya increased in brutality. A barbed wire fence was built from the Mediterranean Sea to the oasis of Jaghbub to sever lines critical to the resistance. Soon afterwards, the colonial administration began the wholesale deportation of the people of the Jebel Akhdar to deny the rebels the support of the local population. The forced migration of more than 100,000 people ended in concentration camps in Suluq and Al-'Aghela where tens of thousands died in squalid conditions. It is estimated that the number of Libyans who died – killed either through combat or starvation and disease – was at least 80,000, and up to half of the Cyrenaican population. After Al-Mukhtar's capture on 15 September 1931 and his execution in Benghazi, the resistance petered out. Limited resistance to the Italian occupation crystallized around Sheik Idris, the Emir of Cyrenaica. Depiction of Mussolini in Italian East Africa Negotiations occurred with the British government on expanding the borders of the colony of Libya. The first negotiations began in 1925 to define the border between Libya and British-held Egypt. These negotiations resulted in Italy gaining previously undefined territory. In 1934, once again the Italian government requested more territory for Libya from British-held Sudan. The United Kingdom allowed Italy to gain some territory from Sudan to add to Libya. These concessions were probably allowed because of the relatively good relations between Italy and Britain prior to 1935. In 1935, Mussolini believed that the time was right for Italy to invade Ethiopia (also known as Abyssinia) to make it a colony. As a result, the Second Italo-Abyssinian War erupted. Italy invaded Ethiopia from the Italian colonies of Eritrea and Somaliland. Italy committed atrocities against the Ethiopians during the war, including the use of aircraft to drop poison gas on the defending Ethiopian soldiers. Ethiopia surrendered in 1936, completing Italy's revenge for its failed colonial conquest of the 1880s. King Victor Emmanuel III was soon proclaimed Emperor of Ethiopia. The international consequences for Italy's belligerence resulted in its isolation at the League of Nations. France and Britain quickly abandoned their trust of Mussolini. The only nation to back Italy's aggression was Germany. After being condemned by the League of Nations, the Grand Council of Fascism declared Italy's decision to leave the League on 11 December 1937 and Mussolini denounced the League as a mere \\"tottering temple\\".Gilbert, Martin (introduction). 1989. The Illustrated London News: Marching to War, 1933–1939. Toronto, Canada: Doubleday Canada Ltd., p. 137.  Race Laws  Front page of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on 11 November 1938 proclaiming that the new racial laws have been passed Until 1938, Mussolini had denied any antisemitism within Fascist Italy and dismissed the racial policies of Nazi Germany. However, by mid-1938 Hitler's influence over Mussolini had persuaded him to make a specific agenda on race, the Fascist regime moved away from its previous promotion of colonialism based on the spread of Italian culture to a directly race-oriented colonial agenda. In 1938, Fascist Italy passed the Manifesto of Race which stripped Jews of their Italian citizenship and prohibited them from any professional position. The racial laws declared that Italians were of the Aryan race and forbid sexual relations and marriages between Italians and Jews and Africans.Davide Rodogno (3 August 2006). Fascism's European Empire: Italian Occupation During the Second World War. Cambridge University Press. p. 65. The Fascist regime declared that it would promote mass Italian settlements in the colonies that would—in the Fascist government's terms—\\"create in the heart of the African continent a powerful and homogeneous nucleus of whites strong enough to draw those populations within our economic orbit and our Roman and Fascist civilization\\".Sarti, Roland. 1974. The Ax Within: Italian Fascism in Action. New York: New Viewpoints, p. 189. Fascist rule in its Italian colonies differed from region to region. Rule in Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana, or AOI), a colony including Ethiopia, Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, was harsh for the native peoples as Fascist policy sought to destroy native culture. In February 1937, Rodolfo Graziani ordered Italian soldiers to pillage native settlements in Addis Ababa, which resulted in hundreds of Ethiopians being killed and their homes being burned to the ground.Sarti, p. 191. After the occupation of Ethiopia, the Fascist government endorsed racial segregation to reduce the number of mixed offspring in Italian colonies, which they claimed would \\"pollute\\" the Italian race.Sarti, p. 190. Marital and sexual relationships between Italians and Africans in its colonies were made a criminal offense when the Fascist regime implemented decree-law No. 880 19 April 1937 which gave sentences of one to five years imprisonment to Italians caught in such relationships. The law did not give any sentences to native Africans, as the Fascist government claimed that only those Italians were to blame for damaging the prestige of their race. Despite racist language used in some propaganda, the Fascist regime accepted recruitment of native Africans who wanted to join Italy's colonial armed forces and native African colonial recruits were displayed in propaganda.http://www.germaniainternational.com/images/bookgijuinit13.jpghttp://www.germaniainternational.com/images/bookgijuinit14.jpg Fascist Italy embraced the \\"Manifesto of the Racial Scientists\\" which embraced biological racism and it declared that Italy was a country populated by people of Aryan origin, Jews did not belong to the Italian race and that it was necessary to distinguish between Europeans and Jews, Africans and other non- Europeans.Joshua D. Zimmerman, Jews in Italy Under Fascist and Nazi Rule, 1922–1945, pp. 119–120 The manifesto encouraged Italians to openly declare themselves as racists, both publicly and politically.Michael A. Livingston, The Fascists and the Jews of Italy: Mussolini's Race Laws, 1938–1943, p. 17 Fascist Italy often published material that showed caricatures of Jews and Africans.Livingston, p. 67 In Italian Libya, Mussolini downplayed racist policies as he attempted to earn the trust of Arab leaders there. Individual freedom, inviolability of home and property, right to join the military or civil administrations and the right to freely pursue a career or employment were guaranteed to Libyans by December 1934. In a famous trip to Libya in 1937, a propaganda event was created when on March 18 Mussolini posed with Arab dignitaries who gave him an honorary \\"Sword of Islam\\" (that had actually been crafted in Florence), which was to symbolize Mussolini as a protector of the Muslim Arab peoples there.Sarti, p. 194. In 1939, laws were passed that allowed Muslims to be permitted to join the National Fascist Party and in particular the Muslim Association of the Lictor (Associazione Musulmana del Littorio) for Islamic Libya and the 1939 reforms allowed the creation of Libyan military units within the Italian Army.Sarti, p. 196.  Balkans  Mussolini inspects the troops in 1934 The Fascist regime also engaged in interventionist foreign policy in Europe. In 1923, Italian soldiers captured the Greek island of Corfu as part of the Fascists' plan to eventually take over Greece. Corfu was later returned to Greece and war between Greece and Italy was avoided. In 1925, Italy forced Albania to become a de facto protectorate which helped Italy's stand against Greek sovereignty. Corfu was important to Italian imperialism and nationalism due to its presence in the former Republic of Venice which left behind significant Italian cultural monuments and influence, though the Greek population there (especially youth) heavily protested the Italian occupation. Relations with France were mixed: the Fascist regime consistently had the intention to eventually wage war on France to regain Italian-populated areas of France,Smith. 1983. p. 172. but with the rise of Hitler the Fascists immediately became more concerned of Austria's independence and the potential threat of Germany to Italy, if it demanded the German-populated areas of Tyrol. Due to concerns of German expansionism, Italy joined the Stresa Front with France and Britain against Germany which existed from 1935 to 1936. The Fascist regime held negative relations with Yugoslavia, as they long wanted the implosion of Yugoslavia in order to territorially expand and increase Italy's power. Italy pursued espionage in Yugoslavia, as Yugoslav authorities on multiple occasions discovered spy rings in the Italian Embassy in Yugoslavia, such as in 1930. In 1929, the Fascist government accepted Croatian extreme nationalist Ante Pavelić as a political exile to Italy from Yugoslavia. The Fascists gave Pavelić financial assistance and a training ground in Italy to develop and train his newly formed fascist militia and terrorist group, the Ustaše. This organization later became the governing force of the Independent State of Croatia, and murdered hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews and Roma during World War II.Glenny, Misha. Balkans: Nationalism, War and the Great Powers, 1804–1999. New York, USA: Penguin Books, 2001. Pp. 431 After Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, Mussolini turned his attention to Albania. On 7 April 1939, Italy invaded the country and after a short campaign Albania was occupied and its parliament crowned Victor Emmanuel III King of Albania. The historical justification for the annexation of Albania laid in the ancient history of the Roman Empire in which the region of Albania had been an early conquest for the Romans, even before Northern Italy had been taken by Roman forces. However, by the time of annexation little connection to Italy remained amongst Albanians. In actuality, the annexation of Albania was far from a military conquest as the country had been a de facto protectorate of Italy since the 1920s and much of its army were commanded by Italian officers sent from Italy. The occupation was not appreciated by King Emmanuel III, who feared that it had isolated Italy even further than its war against Ethiopia.Smith, 1997. p 398–399  Spain  In 1936 in Spain, the Fascist regime made its most significant pre- war military intervention. The Spanish Republic was divided in the Spanish Civil War between the anticlerical socialist Republicans and the Church- supporting nationalists led by Francisco Franco under fascist Falange movement. Italy sent aircraft, weapons and a total of over 60,000 troops to aid the Spanish nationalists. The war helped train the Italian military for war and improve relations with the Roman Catholic Church. It was a success that secured Italy's naval access in and out of the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean and its ability to pursue its policy of Mare Nostrum without fear of opposition by Spain. The other major foreign contributor to the Spanish Civil War was Germany. This was the first time that Italian and German forces fought together since the Franco-Prussian War in the 1870s. During the 1930s, Italy built many large battleships and other warships to solidify Italy's hold on the Mediterranean Sea.  Germany  Italy was Nazi Germany's biggest ally for most of the regime's existence. When the Nazi Party attained power in Germany in 1933, Mussolini and the Fascist regime in public showed approval of Hitler's regime, with Mussolini saying: \\"The victory of Hitler is our victory\\".Smith, Denis Mack. 1983. Mussolini: A Biography. New York: Vintage Books. p. 181. The Fascist regime also spoke of creating an alliance with the new regime in Germany.Smith, 1983. p. 181. In private, Mussolini and the Italian Fascists showed disapproval of the National Socialist government and Mussolini had a disapproving view of Hitler despite ideological similarities. The Fascists distrusted Hitler's Pan-German ideas which they saw as a threat to territories in Italy that previously had been part of the Austrian Empire. Although other National Socialists disapproved of Mussolini and Fascist Italy, Hitler had long idolized Mussolini's oratorical and visual persona and adopted much of the symbolism of the Fascists into the National Socialist Party, such as the Roman, straight-armed salute, dramatic oratory, the use of uniformed paramilitaries for political violence and the use of mass rallies to demonstrate the power of the movement. In 1922, Hitler tried to ask for Mussolini's guidance on how to organize his own version of the \\"March on Rome\\" which would be a \\"March on Berlin\\" (which came into being as the failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923). Mussolini did not respond to Hitler's requests as he did not have much interest in Hitler's movement and regarded Hitler to be somewhat crazy.Smith, 1983. p. 172. Mussolini did attempt to read Mein Kampf to find out what Hitler's National Socialist movement was, but was immediately disappointed, saying that Mein Kampf was \\"a boring tome that I have never been able to read\\" and remarked that Hitler's beliefs were \\"little more than commonplace clichés\\". While Mussolini like Hitler believed in the cultural and moral superiority of whites over colored peoples, he opposed Hitler's antisemitism. A number of Fascists were Jewish, including Mussolini's mistress Margherita Sarfatti, who was the director of Fascist art and propaganda, and there was little support amongst Italians for antisemitism. Mussolini also did not evaluate race as being a precursor of superiority, but rather culture. Hitler and the National Socialists continued to try to woo Mussolini to their cause and eventually Mussolini gave financial assistance to the Nazi Party and allowed National Socialist paramilitaries to train in Italy in the belief that despite differences, a nationalist government in Germany could be beneficial to Italy. As suspicion of the Germans increased after 1933, Mussolini sought to ensure that Germany would not become the dominant nationalist state in Europe. To do this, Mussolini opposed German efforts to annex Austria after the assassination of fascist Austrian President Engelbert Dollfuss in 1934 and promised the Austrians military support if Germany were to interfere. This promise helped save Austria from annexation in 1934. Adolf Hitler and Mussolini walking in front of saluting military during Hitler's visit to Venice, June 1934 Public appearances and propaganda constantly portrayed the closeness of Mussolini and Hitler and the similarities between Italian Fascism and German National Socialism. While both ideologies had significant similarities, the two factions were suspicious of each other and both leaders were in competition for world influence. Hitler and Mussolini first met in June 1934, as the issue of Austrian independence was in crisis. In private after the visit in 1934, Mussolini said that Hitler was just \\"a silly little monkey\\". After Italy became isolated in 1936, the government had little choice but to work with Germany to regain a stable bargaining position in international affairs and reluctantly abandoned its support of Austrian independence from Germany. On 28 October 1937, Mussolini declared Italy's support of Germany regaining its colonies lost in World War I, declaring: \\"A great people such as the German people must regain the place which is due to it, and which it used to have beneath the sun of Africa\\".Gilbert. 1989. pp. 137 With no significant opposition from Italy, Hitler proceeded with the Anschluss, the annexation of Austria in 1938. Germany later claimed the Sudetenland, a province of Czechoslovakia inhabited mostly by Germans. Mussolini felt he had little choice but to help Germany to avoid isolation. With the annexation of Austria by Germany in 1938, the Fascist regime began to be concerned about the majority ethnic German population in South Tyrol and whether they would want to join a Greater Germany. The Fascists were also concerned about whether Italy should follow National Socialist antisemitic policies in order to gain favor from those National Socialists who had mixed feelings about Italy as an ally. In 1938, Mussolini pressured fellow Fascist members to support the enacting of antisemitic policies, but this was not well taken as a number of Fascists were Jewish and antisemitism was not an active political concept in Italy. Nevertheless, Mussolini forced through antisemitic legislation even while his own son-in-law and prominent Fascist Count Galeazzo Ciano personally condemned such laws. In turn for enacting the extremely unpopular antisemitic laws, Mussolini and the Fascist government demanded a concession from Hitler and the National Socialists. In 1939, the Fascists demanded from Hitler that his government willingly accept the Italian government's plan to have all Germans in South Tyrol either leave Italy or be forced to accept Italianization. Hitler agreed and thus the threat to Italy from the South Tyrol Germans was neutralized.  Alliance with Germany  As war approached in 1939, the Fascist regime stepped up an aggressive press campaign against France claiming that Italian people were suffering in France.Smith, 1997. p. 397. This was important to the alliance as both regimes mutually had claims on France, Germany on German-populated Alsace-Lorraine and Italy on Italian-populated Corsica, Nizza and Savoia. In May 1939, a formal alliance was organized. The alliance was known as the Pact of Steel, which obliged Italy to fight alongside Germany if war broke out against Germany. Mussolini felt obliged to sign the pact in spite of his own concerns that Italy could not fight a war in the near future. This obligation grew from his promises to Italians that he would build an empire for them and from his personal desire to not allow Hitler to become the dominant leader in Europe.Smith, 1997. p. 401. Mussolini was repulsed by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact agreement where Germany and the Soviet Union agreed to partition the Second Polish Republic into German and Soviet zones for an impending invasion. The Fascist government saw this as a betrayal of the Anti-Comintern Pact, but decided to remain officially silent.Smith, 1997. p. 401  World War II  == Historiography == Most of the historiographical controversy centers on sharply conflicting interpretations of Fascism and the Mussolini regime.R. J. B. Bosworth, The Italian Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives in the Interpretation of Mussolini and Fascism (1998); Bosworth and Patrizia Dogliani, eds., Italian Fascism: History, Memory, and Representation (1999) The 1920s writers on the left, following the lead of communist theorist Antonio Gramsci (1891–1937), stressed that Fascism was a form of capitalism. The Fascist regime controlled the writing and teaching of history through the central Giunta Centrale per gli Studi Storici and control of access to the archives and sponsored historians and scholars who were favorable toward it such as philosopher Giovanni Gentile and historians Gioacchino Volpe and Francesco Salata.\\"The Centralisation Of Historical Research (1935–1943),\\" Storia della Storiografia (2010), Issue 57, pp. 63–84.

After the war, most historiography was intensely hostile to Mussolini, emphasizing the theme of Fascism and totalitarianism.Paul Preston, \\"Reading History: Fascism,\\" History Today (1985) 35#9 pp 46–49 An exception was conservative historian Renzo De Felice (1929–1996), whose four volumes and 6,000 pages of biography (1965–1997) remain the most exhaustive examination of public and private documents and serves as a basic resource for all scholars. De Felice argued that Mussolini was a revolutionary modernizer in domestic issues, but a pragmatist in foreign policy who continued the Realpolitik policies of liberal Italy (1861–1922).James Burgwyn, \\"Renzo De Felice and Mussolini's Foreign Policy: Pragmatism vs. Ideology,\\" Italian Quarterly (1999), Vol. 36 Issue 141/142, pp 93–103.

The tradeoff for the improved print quality is reduced printing speed. Software can also be used to produce this effect.\\"Printer Utilities: One need not spend a fortune to get fancy fonts, however. Many reasonably priced dot-matrix printers can be persuaded to perform like the more expensive models through the use of printer utility software.\\" The term was coined in the 1980s to distinguish NLQ printing from true letter-quality printing, as produced by a printer based on traditional typewriter technology such as a daisy wheel, or by a laser printer. In 1985 The New York Times described the marketing of printers with the terms \\"near letter-quality, or N.L.Q.\\" as \\"just a neat little bit of hype\\", but acknowledged that they \\"really show their stuff in the area of fonts, print enhancements and graphics\\". ==Technology overview== Near letter-quality is a form of impact dot matrix printing. What The New York Times calls \\"dot-matrix impact printing\\", was deemed almost good enough to be used in a business letter Reviews in the later 1980s ranged from \\"good but not great\\"\\"reminded me that I was reading text printed by a printer rather than by a typewriter. Output from both draft and NLQ modes falls into the category of good but not great. In NLQ, the edges of the letters are slightly ragged.\\" to \\"endowed with a simulated typewriter-like quality\\". By using multiple passes of the carriage, and higher dot density, the printer could increase the effective resolution.\\"... it is accomplished by shifting the print head ever so slightly after each character and then reprinting it. The double strike produced in this fashion yields a higher dot density.\\" For example, the Epson FX-86 could achieve a theoretical addressable dot-grid of 240 by 216 dots/inch using a print head with a vertical dot density of only 72 dots/inch, by making multiple passes of the print head for each line. For 240 by 144 dots/inch, the print head would make one pass, printing 240 by 72 dots/inch, then the printer would advance the paper by half of the vertical dot pitch (1/144 inch), then the print head would make a second pass. For 240 by 216 dots/inch, the print head would make three passes with smaller paper movement (1/3 vertical dot pitch, or 1/216 inch) between the passes. To cut hardware costs, some manufacturers merely used a double strike (doubly printing each line) to increase the printed text's boldness, resulting in bolder but still jagged text. In all cases, NLQ mode incurred a severe speed penalty. Because of the slow speed of NLQ printing, all NLQ printers have at least one \\"draft mode\\", in which the same fonts are used, but with only one pass of the print head per line. This produces lower-resolution printing, but at higher speed. Expensive NLQ printers had multiple fonts built-in, and some had a slot where a font cartridge could be inserted to add more fonts. Printer utility software could be used to print with multiple fonts on less-expensive printers. Not all of these utilities worked with all printers and applications, however. ==References== Category:Impact matrix printers Category:History of computing hardware ","title":"Near letter-quality printing"},{"id":"56046818","text":"Renal ultrasonography (Renal US) is the examination of one or both kidneys using medical ultrasound. Ultrasonography of the kidneys is essential in the diagnosis and management of kidney-related diseases. The kidneys are easily examined, and most pathological changes in the kidneys are distinguishable with ultrasound. US is an accessible, versatile inexpensive and fast aid for decision-making in patients with renal symptoms and for guidance in renal intervention.Content initially copied from: (CC-BY 4.0) Renal ultrasound (US) is a common examination, which has been performed for decades. Using B-mode imaging, assessment of renal anatomy is easily performed, and US is often used as image guidance for renal interventions. Furthermore, novel applications in renal US have been introduced with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), elastography and fusion imaging. However, renal US has certain limitations, and other modalities, such as CT and MRI, should always be considered as supplementary imaging modalities in the assessment of renal disease. ==Technique== The ultrasonic renal exam does not require any preparation of the patient and is usually performed with the patient in the supine position. The kidneys are examined in longitudinal and transverse scan planes with the transducer placed in the flanks. When insonation of the kidney is obscured by intestinal air, the supine scan position is combined with the lateral decubitus position with the transducer moved dorsally. Preferably, the exam is initiated in the longitudinal scan plane, parallel to the long diameter of the kidney, as the kidney is easier to distinguish. In the adult patient, a curved array transducer with center frequencies of 3–6 MHz is used, while the pediatric patient should be examined with a linear array transducer with higher center frequencies. Artifacts of the lowest ribs always shadow the upper poles of the kidneys. However, the whole kidney can be examined during either normal respiration or breath hold, as the kidney will follow the diaphragm and change position accordingly. ==Findings in the normal kidney== In the longitudinal scan plane, the kidney has the characteristic oval bean- shape. The right kidney is often found more caudally and is slimmer than the left kidney, which may have a so-called dromedary hump due to its proximity to the spleen. The kidney is surrounded by a capsule separating the kidney from the echogenic perirenal fat, which is seen as a thin linear structure. The kidney is divided into parenchyma and renal sinus. The renal sinus is hyperechoic and is composed of calyces, the renal pelvis, fat and the major intrarenal vessels. In the normal kidney, the urinary collecting system in the renal sinus is not visible, but it creates a heteroechoic appearance with the interposed fat and vessels. The parenchyma is more hypoechoic and homogenous and is divided into the outermost cortex and the innermost and slightly less echogenic medullary pyramids. Between the pyramids are the cortical infoldings, called columns of Bertin (Figure 1). In the pediatric patient, it is easier to differentiate the hypoechoic medullar pyramids from the more echogenic peripheral zone of the cortex in the parenchyma rim, as well as the columns of Bertin (Figure 2). Figure 1. Normal adult kidney. Measurement of kidney length on the US image is illustrated by ‘+’ and a dashed line. * Column of Bertin; ** pyramid; *** cortex; **** sinus. The length of the adult kidney is normally 10–12 cm, and the right kidney is often slightly longer than the left kidney. The adult kidney size is variable due to the correlation with body height and age; however, normograms for pediatric kidney size are available. Cortical thickness should be estimated from the base of the pyramid and is generally 7–10 mm. If the pyramids are difficult to differentiate, the parenchymal thickness can be measured instead and should be 15–20 mm (Figure 3). The echogenicity of the cortex decreases with age and is less echogenic than or equal to the liver and spleen at the same depth in individuals older than six months. In neonates and children up to six months of age, the cortex is more echogenic than the liver and spleen when compared at the same depth. Doppler ultrasonography of the kidney is widely used, and the vessels are easily depicted by the color Doppler technique in order to evaluate perfusion. Applying spectral Doppler to the renal artery and selected interlobular arteries, peak systolic velocities, resistive index, and acceleration curves can be estimated (Figure 4) (e.g., peak systolic velocity of the renal artery above 180 cm/s is a predictor of renal artery stenosis of more than 60%, and a resistive index, which is a calculated from peak systolic and end systolic velocity, above 0.70 is indicative of abnormal renovascular resistance). File:Normal pediatric kidney.jpgFigure 2. Normal pediatric kidney. * Column of Bertin; ** pyramid; *** cortex; **** sinus. File:Measures of the kidney.jpgFigure 3. Measures of the kidney. L = length. P = parenchymal thickness. C = cortical thickness. ==Cystic renal masses== Masses are seen as a distortion of the normal renal architecture. Most renal masses are simple cortical renal cysts with a round appearance and a smooth thin capsule encompassing anechoic fluid. The incidence increases with age, as at least 50% of people above the age of 50 have a simple cyst in one of the kidneys. Cysts cause posterior enhancement as a consequence of reduced attenuation of the ultrasound within the cyst fluid (Figure 5). The simple cyst is a benign lesion, which does not require further evaluation. Complex cysts can have membranes dividing the fluid-filled center with internal echoes, calcifications or irregular thickened walls. The complex cyst can be further evaluated with Doppler US, and for Bosniak classification and follow-up of complex cysts, either contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) or contrast CT is used (Figure 6). The Bosniak classification is divided into four groups going from I, corresponding to a simple cyst, to IV, corresponding to a cyst with solid parts and an 85–100% risk of malignancy. In polycystic kidney disease, multiple cysts of varying size in close contact with each other are seen filling virtually the entire renal region. In advanced stages of this disease, the kidneys are enlarged with a lack of corticomedullary differentiation (Figure 7). File:Simple cyst with posterior enhancement.jpgFigure 5. Simple renal cyst with posterior enhancement in an adult kidney. Measurement of kidney length on the US image is illustrated by '+' and a dashed line. File:Complex cyst with thickened walls and membranes in the lower pole.jpgFigure 6. Complex cyst with thickened walls and membranes in the lower pole of an adult kidney. Measurements of kidney length and the complex cyst on the US image are illustrated by '+' and dashed lines. File:Advanced polycystic kidney disease with multiple cysts.jpgFigure 7. Advanced polycystic kidney disease with multiple cysts. ==Solid renal masses== Figure 8. Cortical solid mass, which later was shown to be renal cell carcinoma. Measurement of the solid mass on the US image is illustrated by '+' and a dashed line. Figure 9. Renal cell carcinoma with both cystic and solid components located in the cortex. Measurement of tumor on the US image is illustrated by '+' and a dashed line. A solid renal mass appears in the US exam with internal echoes, without the well-defined, smooth walls seen in cysts, often with Doppler signal, and is frequently malignant or has a high malignant potential. The most common malignant renal parenchymal tumor is renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which accounts for 86% of the malignancies in the kidney. RCCs are typically isoechoic and peripherally located in the parenchyma, but can be both hypo- and hyper-echoic and are found centrally in medulla or sinus. The lesions can be multifocal and have cystic elements due to necrosis, calcifications and be multifocal (Figure 8 and Figure 9). RCC is associated with von Hippel–Lindau disease, and with tuberous sclerosis, and US has been recommended as a tool for assessment and follow-up of renal masses in these patients. However, US is not the primary modality for the evaluation of solid tumors in the kidney, and CT is the first choice modality. Nevertheless, hemorrhagic cysts can resemble RCC on CT, but they are easily distinguished with Doppler ultrasonography. In RCCs, Doppler US often shows vessels with high velocities caused by neovascularization and arteriovenous shunting. Some RCCs are hypovascular and not distinguishable with Doppler US. Therefore, renal tumors without a Doppler signal, which are not obvious simple cysts on US and CT, should be further investigated with CEUS, as CEUS is more sensitive than both Doppler US and CT for the detection of hypovascular tumors. Other malignant tumors in the kidney are transitional cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which arise from the urothelium and are found the renal sinus, as well as adenocarcinoma, lymphoma and metastases, which can be found anywhere in the kidney (Figure 10). Benign solid tumors of the kidney are oncocytoma and angiomyofibroma. Oncocytoma has a varying ultrasonic appearance, but may have a central scar or calcification as a hallmark. Angiomyofibroma are often found in patients with tuberous sclerosis. They are composed of fat, smooth muscle tissue and vascular elements. The echogenicity is governed by the composition of these elements, but the lesion is often hyperechoic (Figure 11 and Figure 12). Benign tumors are difficult to separate from malignant tumors using US. Thus, solid renal masses found on US are difficult to classify and should be further evaluated with CT. In special cases of cystic or solid renal masses, additional US guided biopsy or drainage is performed to identify the histologic tumor type before a decision on surgery is made.

Patient with tuberous sclerosis and multiple angiomyolipomas in the kidney. Measurement of kidney length on the US image is illustrated by '+' and a dashed line. ==Hydronephrosis== One of the primary indications for referral to US evaluation of the kidneys is evaluation of the urinary collecting system. Enlargement of the urinary collecting system is usually related to urinary obstruction and can include the pelvis, the calyces and the ureter. Hydronephrosis is seen as an anechoic fluid-filled interconnected space with enhancement within the renal sinus, and normally, the dilated pelvis can be differentiated from the dilated calyces. Figure 13. Hydronephrosis due to ureteropelvic junction obstruction in a pediatric patient. Several conditions can result in urinary obstruction. In both adults and children, masses, such as abscesses and tumors, can compress the ureter. In children, hydronephrosis can be caused by ureteropelvic junction obstruction, ectopic inserted ureter, primary megaureter and posterior urethral valve (Figure 13). In the latter, both kidneys will be affected. In adults, hydronephrosis can be caused by urolithiasis, obstructing the outlet of the renal pelvis or the ureter, and compression of the ureter from, e.g., pregnancy and retroperitoneal fibrosis. Urolithiasis is the most common cause of hydronephrosis in the adult patient and has a prevalence of 10%–15%. Figure 14. Bilateral dilatation of the ureters due to vesicoureteric reflux in a pediatric patient. Under normal conditions, the ureter is not seen with US. However, in, e.g., urinary obstruction and vesicoureteric reflux with dilation of the ureter, the proximal part in continuation with the renal pelvis, as well as the distal part near the ostium can be evaluated (Figure 14). The hydronephrosis is typically graded visually and can be divided into five categories going from a slight expansion of the renal pelvis to end-stage hydronephrosis with cortical thinning (Figure 15). The evaluation of hydronephrosis can also include measures of calyces at the level of the neck in the longitudinal scan plane, of the dilated renal pelvis in the transverse scan plane and the cortical thickness, as explained previously (Figure 16 and Figure 17). If the fluid in the dilated collecting system has echoes, pyonephrosis should be excluded by clinical exam, blood analysis and, in special cases, puncture or drainage. Hydronephrosis can also be caused by non- obstructive conditions, such as brisk diuresis in patients treated with diuretics, in pregnant women and in children with vesicoureteral reflux.

Same patient as in Figure 16 with measurement of the pelvis dilation in the transverse scan plane illustrated on the US image with ‘+’ and a dashed line. ==Kidney stone disease== Even though US has a lower sensitivity and specificity than CT for the detection of kidney stones (urolithiasis), US, if available, is recommended as the initial imaging modality in patients with renal colic and suspected urolithiasis. US has no risk of radiation, is reproducible and inexpensive, and the outcome is not significantly different for patients with suspected urolithiasis undergoing initial US exam compared to patients undergoing initial CT exam. Figure 18. Renal stone located at the pyeloureteric junction with accompanying hydronephrosis. With US, larger stones (>5–7 mm) within the kidney, i.e., in the calyces, the pelvis and the pyeloureteric junction, can be differentiated, especially in the cases with accompanying hydronephrosis (Figure 18 and Figure 19). Hyperechoic stones are seen with accompanying posterior shadowing. Additional twinkling artifacts below the stone can often be seen using Doppler US. Large stones filling the entire collecting system are called coral stones or staghorn calculi and are easily visualized with US (Figure 20). Stones in the ureters are usually not visualized with US due to the air-filled intestines obscuring the insonation window. However, ureteral stones near the ostium can be visualized with a scan position over the bladder. An exam of the ureteric orifices and the excretion of urine to the bladder can be performed by inspecting the ureteric jets in the bladder with color Doppler US.

No stone is visible. The red color in the color box represents motion towards the transducer as defined by the color bar. ==Chronic kidney disease== US is useful for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in chronic kidney disease. Whether the underlying pathologic change is glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis or inflammation, the result is often increased echogenicity of the cortex. The echogenicity of the kidney should be related to the echogenicity of either the liver or the spleen (Figure 22 and Figure 23). Moreover, decreased renal size and cortical thinning are also often seen and especially when disease progresses (Figure 24 and Figure 25). However, kidney size correlates to height, and short persons tend to have small kidneys; thus, kidney size as the only parameter is not reliable.

End-stage chronic kidney disease with increased echogenicity, homogenous architecture without visible differentiation between parenchyma and renal sinus and reduced kidney size. Measurement of kidney length on the US image is illustrated by ‘+’ and a dashed line. ==Acute renal injury== The acute changes in the kidney are often examined with US as the first-line modality, where CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used for the follow-up examinations and when US fails to demonstrate abnormalities. In evaluation of the acute changes in the kidney, the echogenicity of the renal structures, the delineation of the kidney, the renal vascularity, kidney size and focal abnormalities are observed (Figure 26 and Figure 27). CT is preferred in renal traumas, but US is used for follow- up, especially in the patients suspected for the formation of urinomas (Figure 28). File:Ultrasonography of acute pyelonephritis.jpgFigure 26. Acute pyelonephritis with increased cortical echogenicity and blurred delineation of the upper pole.

(A) Percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed through a calyx in the lower pole of a kidney with hydronephrosis. (B) The pigtail catheter is placed in the dilated calyx. The tube in (A) and the pigtail in (B) are marked with white arrows. Sonography is the modality of choice for guidance when performing intervention in the kidney, whether it is kidney biopsy, percutaneous nephrostomy or abscess drainage. Historically, thermal ablation of renal tumors is performed under CT guidance, as the risk of injuring neighboring intestines during the US-guided procedure was considered too high due to poor identification of the moving bowels. However, recent guidelines for renal interventional US include radiofrequency, microwave and cryoablation with US as the ideal imaging guide. For percutaneous nephrostomy and abscess drainage, either the one-step or the Seldinger technique is used. Using the Seldinger technique, the cavity is punctured with a sharp hollow needle, called a trocar. A round-tipped guidewire is then advanced through the lumen of the trocar, and after withdrawal of the trocar, a catheter or nephrostomy can be inserted over the guidewire to ensure correct placement. The one-step technique is when insertion of the drain or nephrostomy is done without the aid of a guidewire. The interventions are performed under local anesthesia and in a sterile setup. The procedures can be carried out with or without needle guidance according to preference, experience and setup (Figure 29). ==CEUS, image fusion and elastography== Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can evaluate microvasculature, which color Doppler US is unable to detect. In renal US examination, CEUS can be used to differentiate tumor and pseudotumor, such as prominent columns of Bertin. Pseudotumors enhance as adjacent renal tissue. The use of CEUS is recommended in special cases to distinguish between cystic and hypovascularized solid lesions, to characterize complex cysts, abscesses, traumatic lesions and ischemic lesions. Figure 30. Renal cell carcinoma successfully treated with thermal ablation, as no contrast enhancement is seen. Solid malignant tumors in the kidney do not exhibit specific enhancement patterns like some liver lesions, and no valid enhancement criteria between benign and malignant renal lesions have been proposed. However, CEUS is used in some patients after ablation of renal cell carcinoma to evaluate contrast uptake in the treated area (Figure 30). Image fusion of ultrasound with a previously recorded dataset of CT or other modalities is rarely used in renal US. Reports on image fusion using CEUS or US combined with CT or MRI in the examination of renal lesions and in difficult US-guided renal interventions have been published (Figure 31). However, no recommendations have been published so far. Elastography is a US method to visualize the elasticity of tissue. Preliminary reports on US elastography used on transplanted kidneys to evaluate cortical fibrosis have been published showing promising results (Figure 32).

The casino opened in 2004 and was expanded to include a 125-room hotel in 2015. ==History== The Stillaguamish Tribe, a party to the Treaty of Point Elliott of 1855, became federally recognized in 1976, but lacked a reservation and had limited revenue from small commercial ventures. In November 2002, the 200 member tribe announced plans to build a casino under the states's enhanced tribal gambling law passed two years earlier. The selected site, on the tribe's trust lands along 35th Avenue Northeast near Interstate 5 west of Arlington, drew backlash from nearby residents concerned about traffic impacts and the loss of the area's rural character. The Tribe planned to demolish 30 homes on a property it owned, asking members living there to relocate with property buybacks. Plans called for the use of a controlled burn by the Bryant Fire Department to raze the site, allowing firefighters to train during the demolition, but the proposal was withdrawn. The $36 million casino project was initially planned to be funded by a loan from a Las Vegas investor though a Michigan pension fund, but the investor's refusal to submit documents to the Washington State Gambling Commission delayed the project indefinitely in May 2003. A $19 million loan from the Marshall Bank was announced in January 2004, reviving the project. The casino, named \\"Angel of the Winds\\", was scaled down from to . It was redesigned to be a temporary venue, with modular elements that could be sold off once the tribe opened a permanent casino near Smokey Point. The Angel of the Winds Casino opened on October 28, 2004, with 425 slot machines and 10 to 12 game tables. The opening of Angel of the Winds came a few weeks after the Tulalip Tribes reopened the competing Quil Ceda Creek Casino in Marysville as a local alternative to the larger Tulalip Casino. During its full year of operation, the casino generated nearly $30 million in revenue for the Stillaguamish Tribe. The tribe was asked by the Washington State Department of Transportation to remove a billboard on Interstate 5 advertising the casino, after outcry from residents opposed to the casino. A $44 million expansion to the casino was completed in December 2008, increasing the number of slot machines to 1,000 and the interior space to . A second, $27 million expansion completed in January 2015 added a five-story hotel with 125 rooms and a smoke shop. The Angel of the Winds Casino and surrounding land formed the Stillaguamish Tribe's designated reservation, approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 2014. In December 2017, the Stillaguamish Tribe signed a 10-year, $3.4 million naming rights deal to sponsor the Angel of the Winds Arena in Everett. The casino announced a $60 million expansion program in 2018, which will add of space, including more gaming space, a restaurant, and a parking garage for 575 vehicles. The first section of the expansion, an expanded gaming floor and bar, opened in September 2019, followed by a bowling alley and events center. The casino was closed for two months during the COVID-19 pandemic and became the first in Western Washington to reopen, doing so on May 13, 2020, with limited capacity and temperature checks. The casino also introduced a no-smoking policy for the entire building. ==References * Category:Buildings and structures in Snohomish County, Washington Category:Casino hotels Category:Casinos completed in 2004 Category:Casinos in Washington (state) Category:Native American casinos Category:Tourist attractions in Snohomish County, Washington Category:2004 establishments in Washington (state) ","title":"Angel of the Winds Casino Resort"},{"id":"56046842","text":"\\"This Christmas Day\\" is a song by Scottish singer-songwriter Amy Macdonald.

Alternatively, Titus might have been the son of Tricostus's brother Spurius Verginius Tricostus Caeliomontanus, consul in 456 BC. Dionysius of Halicarnassus reports his cognomen as Nomentanus but the inscription on the Fasti Capitolini more closely resembles the name Caeliomontanus. ==Biography== In 469 BC, he was consul with Titus Numicius Priscus as his colleague. At the beginning of his term, they each led separate campaigns against the Aequi and the Volsci who had both been setting fire to farmlands around Rome. Tricostus attacked the Aequi with difficulty whereas Priscus fought the Volsci and captured Caenon, the port of Antium, which was the capital of the Volsci. He regrouped with Priscus in order to pillage the Sabine countryside in retaliation for a raid by the Sabines in Roman territory.Dionysius of Halicarnassus IX, 56Livy II, 63 Two years later, in 467 BC, after having taken Antium from the Volsci, the Romans had established a colony there.

She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Howard University and a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Institute of Design in Chicago, as well as a master's degree in printing from the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. She later pursued a Master of Fine Arts in Independent Film and Digital Imaging at Governors State University while in her early seventies. She wished to earn the degree to document artists and their work. She was described as very private and thoughtful. She had one son, Kuumba Hogu, who remarked that he wanted his mother to be remembered through her artwork. ==Career== Jones-Hogu was a member of the Organization of Black American Culture (OBAC), and contributed when they completed the mural Wall of Respect in 1967. It is regarded as the first collective street mural in the United States. She completed the actors' section. Jones-Hogu became involved in printing while studying at The Art Institute of Chicago. Her major in Painting included courses in printmaking, and she discovered that she enjoyed it while taking the coursework for her major. She was working while going to school. She also was able to use printmaking facilities at the Institute of Design. Misch Kohn, the head of printmaking at the time, gave her a key to the printmaking facilities so that she could complete printmaking work there whenever she wanted, usually on evenings and weekends. In 1968, Jones-Hogu co- founded AfriCOBRA, a collective of African-American artists based in Chicago. One of her most famous works while involved with the group was \\"Unite\\", which has been featured in many exhibitions, including at the Tate Modern in London. The work was inspired by a sculpture by Elizabeth Catlett, which she saw while visiting Catlett in Mexico in the summer of 1968. It was also inspired by the 1968 Olympics Black Power salute. She later remarked: \\" I thought we, as a people should unite as a people under this concept.\\" The prints of \\"Unite\\" that she made prior to joining AfriCOBRA were differentiated from the prints she made while in AfriCOBRA by an African sculpture — the prints that she had done previously did not have an African sculpture, and instead had an African head. She created the work \\"Resist Law and Order in a Sick Society\\" due to these events. Many of her works incorporate key phrases as titles. Jones-Hogu also created a work entitled \\"Stop Genocide.\\" The work was based on gangs, which she thought could be used as a force for good if they came together. However, she felt that the gangs were engaging in \\"self-genocide\\" instead of aiming to stop genocide, which she defined as \\"[w]hite on black genocide and crime.\\" She printed this work on Japanese handmade paper, instead of her usual paper that she used for AfriCOBRA prints. The latter paper started to become fragile over the years, prompting her to switch. She printed at the Illinois Institute of Technology, as she did not have a studio at the time. She produced many works with the flag for her thesis at the Illinois Institute of Technology. During this time, she also was filmed for a portion of the documentary Medium Cool, but her parts were not used. Jones-Hogu said that makers of the documentary wished to ask young \\"radical\\" African-Americans about the potential turmoil in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. She remembered that she spoke on \\"the racial and the political attitudes and conditions in the city\\". She appeared in a 2011 documentary entitled \\"AfriCOBRA: Art For The People,\\" and remarked that \\"The people we were making art for looked like us.\\" The \\"Unite\\" print consists of two versions - one was created prior to her co-forming the group in 1969, and another version was created in 1971 after she became a member. Prior to becoming involved with AfriCOBRA, she remarked that her works were informed by a largely negative narrative in the context of racial politics. However, after becoming involved with AfriCOBRA, her individual work shifted and took on a more positive, hopeful narrative. One example is her 1971 screenprint Relate to Your Heritage, which borrows the aesthetics of blacklight and blaxploitation posters but, inverting their typically abusive or trivializing content, depicts black women in royal garb.Ensminger, David. \\"Black Light Panthers: The Politics of Fluorescence,\\" Art in Print, Vol. 5, No. 2 (July–August 2015). She wished to display more positive issues in her politics, and this was a philosophy also echoed by AfriCOBRA. Around 1973, Jones-Hogu shifted from primarily painting to drawing, and to a lesser degree printmaking, as her son would become ill from paint fumes. She used oil-based inks. She had her first solo show involving her prints and drawings. The show was held by a gallery owned by African-American artists. Jones-Hogu started to prepare prints for other artists' work in AfriCOBRA. She felt that her printmaking abilities set her apart, as many artists in AfriCOBRA were painters. Every time she completed a print, she would always put \\"artist's proof\\" on it. She started to do block printing and intaglio, and later moved on to making silkscreen prints once she opened her own shop. She did lithographs for fundraising, and Sammy Davis Jr. reportedly bought one. She briefly served on the board of the South Side Community Art Center, and was heavily involved with it throughout her life. The South Side Community Center was also where her work was first exhibited in the early 1970s, and it went on to feature more exhibits of her work. Jones-Hogu later remarked in an interview that she was told that people had complained about the number of times her work was exhibited at the center, which ended her run of exhibitions there. She did not have a one-person show at the center, but exhibited with artists such as Napoleon Henderson. Later, she donated many of her prints to the Center. Many of her prints had been lost due to flooding, as she stored them in her basement. Jones-Hogu started do much work with pastels and colored pencils starting in the late 1970s and the early 1980s. She began to create many portraits. She created a portrait of Lurlean Dean that Lurlean's son displayed at Lurlean's memorial service. An exhibition of the work of afriCOBRA describes Jones-Hogu's individual art style as \\"fus[ing] political messages, images, and text.\\" Jones-Hogu's work is displayed in many museums, including the Art Institute of Chicago, The Brooklyn Museum, the National Civil Rights Museum, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Her work has appeared in books, including Creating Their Own Image: The History of African American Women Artists, The Black Arts Movement: Literary Nationalism in the 1960s and 1970s, and Toward a People’s Art: The Contemporary Mural Movement. She was represented from 2005 on by her art dealer, David Lusenhop of Lusenhop Fine Art, after she met him at an exhibition in which her work was displayed in 2004. She reportedly walked up to him and asked him why she did not receive an invitation to the show, as her work was being displayed in it. She and Lusenhop became friends. Lusenhop Fine Art, of Cleveland, Ohio, represents the Estate of Barbara Jones-Hogu. Her first solo museum exhibition took place at the DePaul Art Museum in Chicago in 2018. It was entitled Barbara Jones-Hogu: Resist, Relate, Unite 1968–1975. Others were not aware of how much work she had produced until the latest years of her life, when she was moved to a nursing home. Jones-Hogu reportedly told others that she did not produce much work, but many projects of hers were found, and thus they were collected into an exhibition. A catalog for the exhibition was funded by the Terra Foundation for American Art, and will be Jones-Hogu's first monograph. ==References Further reading == * ==External links== * \\"Barbara Jones Hogu - Never The Same\\" (excerpt from a video interview), YouTube, July 25, 2013. * Barbara Jones-Hogu, \\"History, Philosophy and Aesthetics of AFRICOBRA\\".

Historically, there were a limited number of TLDs available in strings of two or three Latin-script characters. This began to change in 2000, when ICANN introduced new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) that were longer than three characters, such as .info and .museum, and led to the crafting of Mohan's Three Laws of Universal Acceptance. In 2010, the first internationalised domain names (IDNs), or domain names using non-Latin characters, were introduced. In 2013 ICANN's New gTLD Program introduced over 1,000 new gTLDs. One issue surrounding the expansion of the Domain Name System’s Root Zone has been the ability of Internet-based applications and systems to handle these domain names. For the principle of Universal Acceptance to be realized, all valid domain names and email addresses must be accepted, validated, stored, processed and displayed correctly and consistently by all Internet-enabled applications, devices and systems. ==Universal Acceptance Steering Group== In January 2015, Ram Mohan (Afilias) and Cyrus Namazi (ex-ICANN) convened a group of experts to discuss the proliferation of Universal Acceptance issues after the increase in the number of TLDs in the root. In February 2015, Mohan and Namazi founded the Universal Acceptance Steering Group (UASG) at the ICANN52 meeting in Singapore. The first face to face meeting of the UASG was held at the ICANN53 meeting in Buenos Aires. The UASG is now an ICANN community-led program, supported by ICANN, to facilitate the adoption of Universal Acceptance principles by software developers and website owners. == Mohan's Laws of Universal Acceptance == In 2002, Ram Mohan, then CTO of the .INFO TLD, experienced the first instances of Universal Acceptance problems, and crafted three laws that appeared valid in the domain name space: # An old TLD will be accepted more often than a new TLD. # An ASCII-only TLD will be accepted more than an IDN TLD. # A two or three letter TLD will be accepted more often than a longer ccTLD or gTLD. As of 2020, these laws appear to still hold true.https://uasg.tech/wp-content/uploads/documents/UASG025-en-digital.pdf The success of Universal Acceptance will result in these laws becoming obsolete. ==Universal acceptance of popular web browsers== One of the primary ways of interfacing with the Internet is through web browsers. For this reason, the UASG commissioned a report on the performance of major browsers in the treatment and acceptance of 17 different domain names registered for the purpose of providing test cases for UA readiness. The study found that desktop browsers generally performed well, but only Internet Explorer performed as expected. Common problems among the other browsers included the failure to properly render the URLs in the tab title bar and failing to treat an ideographic full stop as a delimiter. On mobile platforms, the results of the tests were much more varied, with the same browsers performing differently based on the operating system, with one of the most common problems being the proper display of Unicode URLs. The study concluded that developers are making progress in making browsers UA Ready, but there is more work to on every browser except Internet Explorer, a browser that has been discontinued. == Email address internalization == Internationalized email address is also part of Universal Acceptance Steering Group , where Email Service providers are motivated to start providing email address for IDNs and also engage them to solve issues related to interoperability with legacy systems. Downgrading is not recommended using punycode however providing ASCII Alias email address with EAI is the recommended practice. Aliasing as downgrading technique is being practiced by BSNL, which used XgenPlus email solution. ==Leadership at Universal Acceptance Steering Group== Leaders for UASG are chosen every two years by vote. In February 2015, Ram Mohan was elected founding chair, and Edmon Chung, Richard Merdinger and Mark Svancarek were elected vice chairs. In March 2019 Dr. Ajay Data was elected Chair and Dusan Stojicevic, Mark Svancarek and Dennis Tan Tanaka were elected vice chairs. ==References== Category:Domain Name System Category:Internationalized domain names ","title":"Universal Acceptance"},{"id":"56046970","text":"Recaizade Mahmud Ekrem (; 1 March 1847 – 31 January 1914) was an Ottoman civil servant, writer and literary critic.

Before it was rebuilt in 1935 it was known as Istana Woodneuk. It suffered a major fire in 2006 and has been deemed beyond repair. The remains of the palace, as well as the land it sits on, is private land belonging to the State of Johor. It is not charted on most modern maps and is currently not accessible to the public. The former palace is commonly confused with the demolished Istana Tyersall, which is nearby. The most obvious difference between the two former palaces is the colour of the roof tiles: Istana Tyersall had red tiles, while those of Istana Woodneuk were blue. ==History== in the mid 1800s, Woodneuk House was located on a 36-acre section of the Tyersall Park estate owned by the English trader Captain John Dill Ross.http://www.searlecanada.org/sunderland/images17/LizzieWebberBillSwiftStudyJune2017.pdf Ross died in 1888 and is memorialized in a biography written by his son John Dill Ross Jr.William Napier owned an adjoining estate. Both of these plots of land were sold to Wan Abu Bakar ibni Daeng Ibrahim in 1860. Abu Bakar became Temenggong of Johor when his father, Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim died in 1862. Three days after his father's death he moved his residence to the new combined estate, Tyersall, from Telok Blangah. He made Woodneuk House his main residence (Istana). The Istana Woodneuk served as a temporary residence for Sultan Abu Bakar's third wife Sultana Fatimah bte Abdullah, She was overseeing the design and planning of Istana Tyersall, which was under construction on a small hill not far away from Woodneuk. Sultana Fatimah did not live to see the completion of the palace she designed; Istana Tyersall was completed in 1892, a year after her death on 25 February 1891. Abu Bakar made a will on 14 April 1895 bequeathing the palace to his fourth wife, Sultana Khadijah. He died on 4 June 1895. Sultana Khadijah died in the palace on 1 February 1904, and Abu Bakar's son and successor Sultan Ibrahim Al-Marhum took over. The palace burned down in 1925. A replacement structure, Istana Wooden York, was later designed by Denis Santry of Swan & Maclaren, and built by Nanyang Structural Co. Construction began in 1932 and was completed in 1935, in time for the celebration of the 62nd birthday of Sultan Ibrahim of Johor and his 40 years of reign. The new palace was built for Sultan Ibrahim and his Scottish wife Sultanah Helen. Its new name Wooden York was not generally used, except for a few members of the royal family in the State of Johor, as the name Woodneuk was well entrenched. In 1939, Sultan Ibrahim lent part of the Tyersall estate to be used by the Indian Army as a military camp area to support an effort to mechanise the Indian Army in preparation for World War II. The palace itself continued as the royal residence for the Sultan's family before the beginning of the Battle of Singapore in 1942. Sultan Ibrahim himself was primarily based in Johor. On 9 February 1942, during the Battle of Singapore, the palace temporarily served as the headquarters of the 2/30th Battalion AIF under Major General Gordon Bennett. It was incorrectly known as \\"Tyersall Palace\\" by the battalion stationed there. On 11 February 1942, after a blast of Japanese mortar attack indicated that the nearby junction of Holland Road and Ulu Pandan Road was held by the Japanese Imperial Army, Major General Bennet withdrew his headquarters to Tanglin Barracks. ==Aftermath== After Singapore was liberated in 1945, the palace was briefly occupied by General Sir Miles Dempsey, followed by Commander-in-Chief Sir Montagu Stopford in 1946. On 16 January 1947, Governor-General of Malaya Malcolm MacDonald and his wife Audrey Marjorie Rowley moved into the palace after their long journey from Canada. By 1948 it was returned to the Sultan for his official use. In December 1951 the State of Johor spent S$14,500 to re-roof the palace and the Istana Besar in Johor Bahru. From 1957 to 1986, the palace and its compound were maintained by caretaker Hj. Sulaiman, hired by Johor State Council, who lived with his family not far away from the building. The Singapore Government made a compulsory purchase of Tyersall Park in December 1990, but it remained inaccessible to the public and was left abandoned and uncared for. The palace fell into ruin and the surroundings were covered by thick vegetation due to decades of abandonment. It became a spot for ghost seekers and photographers due to its inaccessibility. Its walls were graffitied by vandals, and it was used as a store by construction workers for a nearby construction site. On 10 July 2006, the palace burned down due to a major fire attributed to drug addicts. Its blue roof tiles caved in and its condition was deemed beyond repair and structurally unsafe. In April 2015, the forest path leading to the premises was cordoned off by the Singapore Police. In February 2016, a police signboard was spotted near the path warning would-be trespassers to stay away. ==See also== * Istana Tyersall * Tyersall Park * Abu Bakar of Johor * Ibrahim of Johor ==References== Category:Places in Singapore Category:Abandoned buildings and structures Category:Palaces in Singapore Category:Royal residences in Singapore Category:Protected areas of Singapore Category:Houses completed in 1935 Category:1935 establishments in the British Empire Category:1935 establishments in Singapore ","title":"Istana Woodneuk"},{"id":"56047238","text":"Javier F.

She produced her best form as a two-year-old in 1985, when she was unbeaten in three races including the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes, and was rated the best of her age and sex in Ireland. She failed to win in 1986 and was retired from racing at the end of the year. As a broodmare he produced two minor races but no top-class performers. ==Background== Gayle Gal was a chestnut mare with a white blaze and a long white sock on her left hind leg, bred in Ireland by Miss E Anderson. As a yearling in 1984 she was offered for sale at Goffs and was bought for a \\"bargain\\" price of 4,200 guineas. She entered the ownership of Mr W A L Finnigan and was sent into training with Phil Canty in Ireland. She was sired by Lord Gayle, an American-bred stallion who won the Prix Perth in 1970. Lord Gayle's other winning progeny included Blue Wind, Carroll House, Desirable, Gay Lemur (Jockey Club Stakes) and the leading hurdler Pollardstown. Gayle Gal's dam Best Girl won over nine furlongs and was a granddaughter of Garrucha, whose other descendants have included Lake Coniston. ==Racing career== 1985: two-year-old season Gayle Gal began her track career in August in a minor event over six furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse for which she started a 20/1 outsider but upset the odds by winning from Welsh Fantasy (later to win the Gallinule Stakes) and nine others. Two weeks later the filly contested the Oldtown Stud Stakes over the same course and distance in which he faced nine rivals including Sherkraine who had finished third behind Roaring Riva and So Directed in the Phoenix Stakes. She took the lead two furlongs out and stayed on well to come home three lengths clear of Sherkraine. On 14 September Gayle Gal, ridden by the apprentice jockey Donal Manning, was moved up in class to contest the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes the Curragh and started the 5/2 favourite against fourteen opponents. The best of the other runners, according to the betting market, were Alpine Swift, Special Thanks, Gaily Gaily, Flyaway Bride, Classic Style and So Directed. With no previous Group race winners involved, the field seemed to be a sub-standard one. After tracking the front-running Flyaway Bride, Gayle Gal moved up to take the lead approaching the last quarter mile and held off the challenge of the outsider Carhue Lady to win by a length. The filly was expected to end her season with a trip to England for the Cheveley Park Stakes but was withdrawn from the race when a blood test revealed an abnormally high white cell count. In the official International Classification of European two-year-olds for 1985, Gayle Gal was given a rating of 72, making her the best Irish-trained female, eight pounds inferior to the French-trained Baiser Vole, who was the highest-rated juvenile filly. The independent Timeform organisation awarded her a rating of 100p (the \\"p\\" indicating that she was expected to make more than usual progress), fourteen pounds behind their best two-year-old filly Femme Elite. In their annual Racehorses of 1985 Timeform commented \\"If she can produce the speed she possesses when raced over middle distances, she could be in for a successful time as a three-year-old\\". 1986: three-year-old season Gayle Gal remained in training as a three- year-old but failed to make any impact in two starts. The only major race she contested was the Phoenix Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Phoenix Park on 7 September. Ridden by Manning, she started a 33/1 outsider and came home last of the thirteen runners behind Park Express. ==Breeding record== After the end of her racing career, Gayle became a broodmare for the Irish breeder D H W Dobson. She produced at least six foals and two winners: *Nordic Glare, a bay colt, foaled in 1990, sired by Nordico. Failed to win in eight races. *Eileenog, bay filly, 1991, by Kahyasi. Failed in five races. *Celladonia, bay colt, 1992, by Green Desert. Won five races. *Canadian Project, chestnut filly, 1993, by Project Manager. Won one race. *Gaelic Project, bay filly, 1996, by Project Manager. Failed to win in five races. *Palacio, chestnut colt (later gelded), 1997, by Erin's Isle.

It was written by Elijah Aron and Jordan Young, and directed by Mike Hollingsworth. The episode was released in the United States, along with the rest of season three, via Netflix on July 22, 2016. Angela Bassett provides her voice in a guest appearance in the episode. The episode features BoJack travelling to a film festival in the ocean, where he wears an oxygen-filled bubble to continue breathing. Notably, the episode features less than three minutes of audible dialogue. In 2017, the episode was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Animation at the 69th WGA Awards. The episode \\"Stop the Presses\\" from the same season won the award. The episode was also nominated for Best Animated Television Production at the 44th Annie Awards. == Plot == Ana Spanakopita sends BoJack to the world's biggest underwater film festival to promote Secretariat. Unfortunately, ex-Secretariat director Kelsey Jannings is also attending. Faced with the thought of seeing her, BoJack panics: not only will he have to have an awkward confrontation, he will have to do it underwater, where speaking is inhibited by his helmet. BoJack goes to the festival lobby where press events are underway. A group of fish journalists takes his picture, so he poses for them—giving them the thumbs-up sign, not knowing that this gesture is offensive in Pacific Ocean City. He notices Kelsey sadly trying to drum up interest in her movie, so he tries to write her an apology note, but she disappears before he can give it to her. BoJack falls asleep on the bus, where he has to help a male seahorse give birth, and becomes stranded far from the city. As he starts his long walk back to the festival, he realizes that one of the baby seahorses clung to him, so he reluctantly decides to find its dad. Following many misadventures, he reunites the baby with its father, but it turns out that it was not missed. The seahorse dad invites BoJack in for dinner and even offers him money, but BoJack declines. The dad seems to ask, \\"What do you want?\\" but BoJack does not know. He leaves, depressed and jealous of the seahorse family. BoJack catches a cab back to the hotel. En route, he writes a heartfelt apology note to Kelsey. He arrives too late to attend the premiere, so he returns to the hotel just in time for the afterparty, where he learns that Secretariat was a huge hit. As Kelsey leaves the party, BoJack runs after her cab, but by the time he reaches her window, his soggy note is runny and blurred. Kelsey speeds off without knowing what he wanted to say. As BoJack stands at a crosswalk, a man with a helmet yells at him by pressing a button on the collar. Realizing that he could speak the whole time, BoJack presses the button and the episode finishes with him saying \\"Oh you have got to be kidding—\\" == Reception == \\"Fish Out of Water\\" received critical acclaim, with many critics calling it one of the series' best episodes, and one of the best television episodes of 2016. Les Chappell of AV Club described the episode as \\"nothing short of a masterpiece, a culmination of both BoJack Horseman's unique animation style and its views on isolation and connection\\". Joe.ie's Rory Cashin called it \\"one of the greatest episodes of TV ever made\\". For Vulture, Jesse David Fox praised the episode as \\"a must- watch\\", noting that \\"the best part is, you don't have to have watched a single other episode of the series to love it\\". == References  External links == * \\"Fish Out of Water\\" on Netflix * * Category:BoJack Horseman episodes Category:2016 American television episodes ","title":"Fish Out of Water (BoJack Horseman)"},{"id":"56047428","text":"The Salter House in Argonia, Kansas is a historic house at 220 W.

Meditation is a behavioral method that has been used for several thousand years to monitor and regulate emotion and attention. Broadly speaking, meditation can be categorized into one of four modes (formal practices): focused attention, open monitoring, and compassion or love- kindness practices. In addition, there are sub-variations of each of the aforementioned practices that exist, such as prayer and zen. Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensory or emotional experience that points to possible or actual tissue damage. The mechanisms underlying pain have been studied in order to develop methods to alleviate chronic pain. Research on meditation has shown that it involves specific brain regions that reduce overall pain perception. == Neural mechanisms == Several studies using meditation experts as subjects have shown that meditative practices impact several regions of the brain. Studies using functional and structural MRI studies have shown increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of individuals engaging in mindfulness meditation. Additionally, functional changes in the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) as well as activity in nociceptive processing have been observed in neuroimaging studies on meditation. Meta-analysis research using fMRI on the various modes of meditation has shown activation in the pre- motor cortex, basal ganglia, and insular cortex- regions associated with the reward pathways of the brain as well as motor control. Activation of the precentral gyrus, midbrain, inferior parietal lobule, precuneus, and hippocampus have also been correlated with meditation using PET scans and single photon emission computed tomography. Moreover, in a study using experienced meditators, the findings showed increased cortical thickness in the PFC. Increased activation in the PFC has been correlated with chronic pain. In a study comparing the MRI scans of chronic lower back pain patients before and after treatment to their healthy counterparts, patients with chronic pain exhibited thinner PFCs than the control. After treatment, chronic lower back patients showed increased thickness in the PFC which decreased pain perception and physical disability. Additional brain regions are involved in pain perception in what is referred to as the 'pain matrix'. The pain matrix includes the primary somatosensory cortex (SI), insula, ACC, and thalamus. Reduction of pain perception via mediation is mediated by the interconnected brain pathways between pain perception and meditation. These intersections are what contribute to the reduction in perceived pain via mediation. In a study using MEG and fMRI on a yoga master, researchers found that MEG recordings showed higher peaks of alpha waves in meditators as opposed to non-meditators in the parietal, occipital, and temporal regions; and fMRI images showed changes in the thalamus and SI regions. The resulting findings showed a reduction in pain perception, which is consistent in studies where researchers found deactivation of the thalamus in experienced meditators. A study recorded the response of thermal pain stimuli in experienced and novice meditators. Researchers found that long term meditators showed lower responses in the PFC and ACC, and that after 5 months of training, the control also experienced decreased responses in those same areas. As a result, reduction in pain perception is attributed to a decrease in brain regions involving the pain network. A study using event-related potentials (ERP) showed that the meditation group exhibited decreased activation in the SI and posterior insula compared to a healthy control, which led to a reduction in pain perception. This is mediated by the fact that pain is a result of activation of the insula and SI, so a deactivation of these regions as a result of meditation reduces pain perception. == See also == * Mindfulness-based pain management * Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy * Mindfulness-based stress reduction * Full Catastrophe Living == References == Category:Meditation Category:Pain management ","title":"Meditation and pain"},{"id":"56047470","text":"Fedot, Федот is a masculine Russian form of given name Theodotus which may refer to: * Fedot Alekseyevich Popov (died between 1648 and 1654), Russian explorer * Fedot Shubin (1740-1805), Russian sculptor * Fedot Sychkov (1870-1958), Russian painter * the title character of the 1985 poem The Tale of Fedot the Strelets Category:Russian masculine given names ","title":"Fedot"},{"id":"56047504","text":"The men's road race at the 1927 UCI Road World Championships was the inaugural edition of the professional event.The peloton was formed of professionals and amateurs, and each were categorised accordingly.

The same Clemente, in 1982, decided to donate the rest of the collection to the Town of Pistoia, where it is preserved still today in the Forteguerriana Library. ==Description== In all, the collection consists of 4668 units: 4116 are at the Forteguerriana, 552 are at the Archive of the Chapter. The oldest objects, manuscripts, come about because of the patronage of the Rospilgliosi Family, with a great deal of music by the composers that were active in Pistoia, Pisa and Florence in the 1700s (for example Giovan Gualberto Brunetti, Charles-Antoine Campion, Giuseppe Gherardeschi, Christian Joseph Lidarti) as well as at the national level (such as Giovanni Battista Sammartini, Niccolò Jommelli and Giuseppe Farinelli). Most of these are conserved today in the Archive of the Chapter because of their sacred nature. The Forteguerriana Library, however, hosts the manuscript of Ercole in Tebe by Jacopo Melani in 1661 of theatrical origin. The core of the collection is based on the acquisitions in the 1800s by Giovan Carlo, and is made up of: some arias composed for him by the local songwriter Raffaello Bertini (of which the Forteguerriana Library conserves the handwritten copies), numerous opera librettos (of almost all of the authors found in Pistoia from 1868 to 1902, from Rossini to Mabellini, from Mercadante to Massenet, from Pacini to Gounod, from Meyerbeer to Bellini, from Donizetti to Bizet, from Auber to Verdi, to whom he shares a strong spirit for the Risorgimento), printed editions of arias for voice (suitable for his own range of baritone, but also for other voice types) inspired by miscellaneous and contemporary collections and often with piano accompaniment (librettos and songs are at the Forteguerriana), publications regarding musical topics (today at the Archive of the Chapter), such as publications by the theorists of the 1800s and 1900s (Abramo Basevi, Riccardo Gandolfi) as well as letters and other writings by composers (for example letters by Bellini in an edition dated 1882, and the artistic memories of Pacini printed from 1865 to 1872). ==Notes *Musical Documentation Center of Tuscany (it) *Pistoia's Forteguerriana Library (it) *Pistoia's Archive of the Chapter (it) *Rete Documentaria della Provincia di Pistoia (REDOP), Site of the libraries in the Pistoia's area (it) Category:Pistoia Category:Music archives Category:Archives in Italy Category:Music organisations based in Italy ","title":"Rospigliosi Music Collection"},{"id":"56047543","text":"The Accademia degli Umoristi (Academy of the Humorists) was a learned society of intellectuals, mainly noblemen, that significantly influenced the cultural life of 17th century Rome.

It is revealed that Eesa lives in a world of his own and believes that Selvi, who was killed a few months back, is still alive. He keeps her body in his hut and kills the murderers. A few months back, Eesa, who spent most of the time with his friend Kadukkai (Singampuli), fell in love with Selvi. Selvi accepted his love, and they got married. She later became pregnant. One day, Selvi saw Thanga Malai Annachi and his gang brutally murdering a government official and his wife. Selvi questioned them, resulting in her brutal murder. Eesa, who was working in the salt pan, heard a cry of pain and discovered his wife in blood. Eesa tried to save her, but she died in his arms. The rest of the story is how Eesa killed Thanga Malai Annachi. ==Cast== *Vignesh as Sudaleeswaran aka Eesa *Lakshana as Selvi *Thoothukudi M.

She became Denmark's first female mayor in January 1950 when she was elected Mayor of Stege on the island of Møn. ==Biography== Born on 4 March 1884 in Næstved, Eva Marie Braae was the daughter of the paper merchant Hans Frederik Braae (1851–1924) and Augusta Margrethe Jørgensen (1863–1940). She had hoped to become a physician but after covering the cost of her four brothers' education, her parents could not afford to send their two daughters to university. After completing her basic schooling, from 1901 Eva Braae worked for a number of years as a teacher in a Næstved private school. After persuading her father to send her to high school, she matriculated from N. Zahle's School in 1907. She then began to read medicine but abandoned her studies when in 1912 she married the lawyer Rudolph Madsen who was the town clerk of Stege on the island of Møn. For the next few years, Madsen raised her daughter and taught in the local school. In 1926, she was persuaded to be elected president of the Møn branch of the Danish Women's Society. Three years later, she was elected as a municipal representative of the Social Liberal Party (Radikale Venstre), beginning 20 years service on the municipal council. This included chairing several committees, including those on education and child welfare for extended periods until 1950. In 1946, she was appointed deputy mayor, successfully achieving her political goals and gaining popularity. She was particularly adept at collaborating with the male members of the council while constantly promoting the need for attention to be given to the views of her female colleagues. In 1950, she stated that she would be ready to support the election of a female mayor, whatever her political party. On 25 January 1950, following the death of the Conservative mayor Christian F. Carøe in a road accident, she was elected Mayor of Stege Municipality. She had however already announced her retirement and her intention not to stand at the municipal elections on 14 March. She therefore only served as mayor for a couple of months. Following her retirement she moved to Charlottenlund with her husband, who died in 1958. She continued to live there with her daughter and grandchild until her death in Ordrup on 16 March 1972. She is buried in Ordrup Cemetery. ==References== Category:1884 births Category:1972 deaths Category:People from Næstved Municipality Category:Women mayors of places in Denmark Category:Mayors of places in Denmark Category:People from Møn ","title":"Eva Madsen"},{"id":"56047758","text":"Pjotr Degtjarjov (born 10 July 1993, Tallinn) is an Estonian swimmer.

Eventually, test watchers were equipped with mobile devices designed for reporting and communications. Authorities also started to apply a mutli- layer model in areas with denser populations. From 2004 to 2007, the program was rolled out to 51 new areas. In 2011, when the Arab Spring broke out, China prelaunched the program nationwide to monitor sensitive areas and ensure social stability. In 2015, the grid-style social management system was rolled out to the whole country. It is perceived as a substitute to the former community-driven social compounds composing the country's social order that faded away with the growth of the country's mega-cities. ==Description== The grid-style social management process consists in subdividing a country's counties into smaller zones, and assign each zone to a person that reports all activity to the local government on a regular basis. This model is applied in rural areas and cities. In cities, a person may be assigned to a specific number of households. The grid-style social manager is expected to report on the population size in the area, housing and facilities, social organizations, among other things. The number of grid-style social management people is regulated to ensure it is three times the size of local governments in human resources. The reporters are paid by their local government, usually between $50 and $80 a month (and rewards for exceptional reporting), become beneficiaries of the state insurance, but receive no specific training. In rural areas, taxi drivers and sanitation workers are often hired as watchers. Grid-style social management watchers wear a red armband.Mendie McKeown, A Joint Solidarity Statement. UN Human Rights Declaration: 70 Year Milestone – Stand Up for Human Rights for All People Under Chinese Rule, Tibetnetwork.org, 9 December 2018 (accessed on 30 April 2019) Despite its advanced technological surveillance systems, China relies on its grid-style social management system to identify new threats, an area where technology is still shy compared to human surveillance. It has been described by Wu Qiang as a model for a contemporary police state. The grid-style social management system is connected to the authorities' CCTV cameras and police databases to achieve enhanced surveillance.Adrian Zenz, James Leibold, Chen Quanguo: The Strongman Behind Beijing’s Securitization Strategy in Tibet and Xinjiang, Jamestown.org, 21 September 2017 (accessed on 30 April 2019) The China Grid Computing Center divides 25.38 square kilometers into 1,652 single geographic grid cells of 100 square meters. Each single cell is assigned a unique 14-digit code. The system is not specific to a country or culture, and could be replicated in any other country.China's Dystopian Tech Could Be Contagious, Theatlantic.com, 14 February 2018 (accessed on 30 April 2019) ==Critics== When implementing the grid-style social management network, the Chinese government did not develop a community-outreach strategy to make its local agents part of the local life. Thus locals tend to perceive grid-style social managers as spies of the central government. Some scholars have also expressed their concerns regarding the right to personal privacy, and the potential risks of giving untrained individuals extralegal authority. Officials reply that the system is legal, and that its watchers' report are genuinely true. Humanitarian NGOs are also concerned about the implementation of the grid-style social management system in regions such as Tibet where the Chinese government has been historically oppressive. The situation also became critical in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region where humanitarian NGOs have reported that a biological database to track Uyghurs's DNA had been developed by the authorities and integrated within its grid-style surveillance system.Rachel Harris, Securitization and mass detentions in Xinjiang: How Uyghurs became quarantined from the outside world, Qz.com, 4 September 2018 (accessed on 30 April 2019)China: Minority Region Collects DNA from Millions, Hrw.org, 13 December 2017 (accessed on 30 April 2019) ==See also== *Mass line *Grid plan *Social Credit System, technological successor ==References== Category:Law enforcement in China Category:Ideology of the Communist Party of China ","title":"Grid-style social management in China"},{"id":"56047927","text":"Mother () is a 2018 South Korean television series starring Lee Bo-young, Heo Yool and Lee Hye-young.

He was said to be a grandson of a French army officer, who visited this section in 1745. Navarre was born at Detroit in 1785, where his father before him was born. In 1807, with his brother Robert, he erected a cabin near the mouth of the Maumee River (east side), which continued to be his residence while he lived. Besides Canadian French he could speak the Pottawatomie dialect, and partially those of other tribes. In woodcraft and Indian methods he was very skillful, while his bearing was ever that of \\"born gentleman\\". For several years he was employed by a Detroit house in buying furs of the Miamis near Fort Wayne, Indiana, where he made the acquaintance and friendship of chief Little Turtle. ==War of 1812== The war of 1812-15 closed the fur trade, when Navarre and his three brothers—Robert, Alexis and Jaquot (James)--tendered their services to General William Hull. He also besought Hull to accept the services of the Miamis, which were declined, and they afterwards took part with the British. Before seeing active service, the Navarres were included in the surrender of Hull, and paroled, although they denied the right to treat him as a prisoner of war and at once took an active part for the United States; whereupon General Proctor, the British commander, offered a reward of $1000 for Navarre's head or scalp. Peter Navarre assisted in delivering sharpshooters to the Battle of Lake Erie and delivered Oliver Hazard Perry's message \\"We have met the enemy, and they are ours\\" to William Henry Harrison. Peter Navarre survived the Battle of Frenchtown. Until the close of the war he acted as a scout for General William Henry Harrison. He used to say that the worst night he ever spent was as a bearer of a despatch from Harrison, then at Fort Meigs, to Fort Stephenson. Amid a thunderstorm of great fury and fall of water, he made the trip of over thirty miles through unbroken wilderness, and the morning following delivered to Harrison a reply. ==Post War Life== The Peter Navarre Cabin, currently located in the Toledo Botanical Garden. Because his name was not on an enlistment roll, the law provided no pension for his service, but by special act of Congress his last days were made more comfortable by pecuniary relief. At the close of the war he returned to his home, near the mouth of the Maumee river, where he spent the balance of his life, dying in East Toledo, March 20, 1874, in his eighty- ninth year. For several years previous to his death he served as President of the Maumee Valley Pioneer Association. ==ReferencesSources== *Henry Howe's History of Ohio ==External links== *\\"Peter Navarre's spot in history lives locally\\" by Carl Ryan, Toledo Blade Navarre Navarre Category:American soldiers Category:Ohio pioneers Category:American people of French descent ","title":"Peter Navarre"},{"id":"56047978","text":"Pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma is a rare benign tumour of the lung. ==Clinical== The most common presentation is as an incidental lesion noticed on a chest x-ray.Baysak A, Oz AT, Moğulkoç N, Bishop PW, Ceylan KC (2013) A rare tumor of the lung: pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma (pneumocytoma).

He has taught at The United States Military Academy at West Point; Georgetown University; The University of Pennsylvania; and the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. His publications have mainly focused on alliance systems and unionization in the United States military. He also co- authored a book called Prisoners of War?: Nation-States in the Modern Era. ==Background== He earned a Masters degree in History and a doctorate in Political Science from the University of Michigan.

He has taught at Catholic University and Georgetown University. ==Alliance theory== Sabrosky's work on alliance theory showed that a conflict escalates when a major power intervenes in a war between a minor state and another major state. Sabrosky has identified three types of conflicts in this analysis: \\"localized wars\\" between the original belligerents, \\"expanded wars\\" which include several belligerents, and enlarged wars that include a major power on both sides of the conflict. ==Unionization of the military== In the book Blue Collar Soldiers: Unionization and the U.S. Military Sabrosky, who edited the volume, states that \\"military unions are simply too great a risk for a political democracy\\" adding that it would be \\"unwise to expect unions not to act like unions over the long term, and in doing so call into question the basis of our national security\\". ==Controversy== Sabrosky has been critical of those who serve in the IDF, but not in the U.S. armed forces. Daniel Flesch, a former IDF paratrooper, has called Sabrosky a conspiracy theorist and criticized him for writing that \\"a large majority of American Jews...espouse a form of political bigamy called dual loyalty\\". The Anti-Defamation League named him as a key figure in anti- Semitic 9/11 conspiracy theories. Dr. Sabrosky himself has one Jewish grandparent, although he does not identify particularly strongly with this Jewish ancestry, stating \\"an outside identity, Jewish or other, has never meant much at all to me.

Its main teleport is in the province of Rizal. ==History== PHILCOMSAT was formed as a joint venture between the government of the Philippines under the administration of then President Ferdinand Marcos and the Philippine Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (POTC), a firm established by businessman Potenciano Ilusorio and then Defense secretary Juan Ponce Enrile. On May 2, 1968, the company, as the Philippines’ signatory to Intelsat and Inmarsat, formally inaugurated a permanent earth station in Baras, Rizal. This linked the country to a worldwide communications satellite network. On June 21, 1969, the company was given a franchise through Republic Act No. 5514 to operate grounds stations and other facilities for international satellite communications. It was also granted tax exemptions under the same law. Under Republic Act No. 11226 signed into law on February 22, 2019, Philcomsat's telecommunications mega-franchise was extended until 2044. Philcomsat became the major supplier of international circuits for telecommunications firms in the country such as the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) and other carriers. In 1982, the government sold its stake to the POTC, making the latter the sole owner of Philcomsat. Since 2000, the Republic of the Philippines has owned 35% of POTC, while a group of private shareholders, notably the Ponce-Enrile and Ilusorio families, own the balance. After the People Power Revolution of 1986, the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) of then President Corazon Aquino sequestered Philcomsat and POTC. This allowed the Aquino administration and subsequent governments to install their nominees in the board of directors of Philcomsat and POTC, none of whom were experts in the field of telecommunication. This led to the decline in the business of both companies. After an extensive investigation by the Philippine Senate in 2006-2007, it was found that the PCGG nominees plundered and decimated the two companies. In 2016, the Supreme Court ruled that the two companies had been wrongly sequestered since 1987. Currently managed by the scions of POTC’s founders, Lin I. Bildner and Katrina Ponce- Enrile, Philcomsat was able to recover some of the funds dissipated by the former boards of directors and management and to rebuild its telecommunications business. Philcomsat currently provides satellite communication services for the Philippine government and, in partnership with Australian satellite services supplier Speedcast International, is a major installer for and provider of President Rodrigo Duterte's \\"Free Wi-Fi For All” project administered jointly by the United Nations Development Programme and the Department of Information and Communication Technology (DICT). ==References== Category:Telecommunications companies of the Philippines Category:Companies listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange ","title":"Philippine Communications Satellite Corporation"},{"id":"56048016","text":"Maria (Bulgarian: Мария) was a Bulgarian royal consort as the wife of the Knyaz Boris I of Bulgaria.

Melville identified a specimen in Ludlow in 1939, calling it in a 1946 paper \\"a good form of U. carpinifolia\\" [:U. minor ], describing it more fully and renaming it U. carpinifolia Gled. var. glandulosa (Lindl.). Regarding it as out of its natural range and deliberately planted, he referred to it as The Ludlow Elm, the \\"type tree\\" of a \\"variety\\" of Field Elm. Herbarium specimens of 'Glandulosa' are held in both the Lindley Herbarium in Cambridge and the Borrer Herbarium at Kew. Ley (1910) noted that other forms of field elm exhibit \\"the same glandular development, but without the same [leaf-]shape\\". He considered that \\"These must probably be placed under var. glandulosa\\". ==Description== Lindley reported the leaves \\"very glandular beneath\\". Melville (1946) included an illustration of a natural-size short shoot, with leaves on average 7 × 3 cm, with a slender base to the long side and a long petiole to 12 mm, and gave the following description: \\"Distal and subdistal leaves of the short shoots narrowly obovate, acute, with greatest breadth about 45% of the lamina length in the distal and 50% in the subdistal leaves; basal half of margin of long side, arched or nearly straight, making a sharp rectangular turn at the base 2–4 mm from the petiole\\". Ley (1910) added that the leaves are \\"scabrous and epilose above, pilose beneath\\". ==Pests and diseases== Though susceptible to Dutch Elm Disease, field elms produce suckers and usually survive in this form in their area of origin. ==Cultivation== Lindley noted that the tree was cultivated near Ludlow, where Ley in 1910 found \\"large trees on the terraces, upper and lower, of Ludlow Castle, to the west side\\",herbariaunited.org, herbarium specimen, Ulmus glabra Ley var. glandulosa, Ludlow, A.

When it closed it was the second oldest student-run community theater in the U.S. Punchinello - located on the St. Paul campus - originated for the purpose of improving the lives of the greater community. As a University-associated theater it changed with the times and continued to explore and interrogate the human condition. Punchinello Players closed in 1994 due primarily to its home, North Hall (formerly the St. Paul Campus Dining Hall), being slated for demolition. ==Debut== Back to the Farm Back to the Farm was a two-year production (1913–1915) written by College of Agriculture student Merline H. Shumway and directed by Estelle Cook, English Instructor at the Agricultural School Back to the Farm : A Play in Three Acts to create awareness of the University's new Agricultural Extension Program in the rural communities of Minnesota. Back to the Farm was created to demonstrate the value of scientifically trained farmers. It centers around a farm family in which the father is an old-school farmer, who isn't open to his sons' new ideas about how to do things. The son leaves the farm and enrolls at a nearby agricultural college for their 4-year program. They mend their relationship and he returns to the farm, implementing what he's learned - with the result that the farm becomes the most productive in the state. Initially presented at County Fairs around the state, its popularity exceeded expectations and the play continued to tour at farmers' institutes, other educational sessions and also at social events. It was performed fifty times in the first year and many more times for years afterwards. Follow-up plays including Kindling the Hearth Fire and Partners - written by Shumway, Cook and others, all directed by Cook - were also well received, and in those years through 1922 a set of plays were created, performed and made available in bulletin form for communities to perform themselves. The Agricultural Extension Program (along with General Extension, founded 4 years later in 1913) aimed to support Minnesota farming and also increase attendance for the School of Agriculture. That Agricultural School - available to farm community members 16 and older - provided farm instruction and advancement to the College of Agriculture, Forestry and Home Economics for those interested. As a Land-grant university, there was a necessary focus on providing agricultural instruction that met the needs of the State of Minnesota, and getting students in place for that instruction. George Edgar Vincent - University President from 1911-1917 - put in place innovative programming including 'University Weeks' with plays, lectures, concerts and debates similar to the Chautauqua Institute he had previously led, in the spirit of increasing educational and cultural opportunities for the general public. Those initial rural productions of Back to the Farm launched the existence of Punchinello Players in 1914, originally under the name the Minnesota Agriculture Dramatic Club. The organization changed its name to Punchinello Players in 1923. For much of the early decades, all members of Punchinello were students enrolled in the College of Agriculture, Forestry and Home Economics. Punchinello operated out of various spaces including the Main Building Auditorium and assorted temporary buildings on the St. Paul Campus through till the 1960s. ==Performing Venue== Punchinello Players was based on the St. Paul Campus its whole existence. When formed as the Agricultural Dramatic Club, it served a functional purpose, and there were only a few other theater groups operating - primarily the University of Minnesota's Masquers Club and Players Club. Old Log Theater started in 1940, and local theater came to life in the 1970s. Scott Hall on the University of Minnesota Campus East Bank was modern and well-furnished when it was built in 1921, and the Agricultural Dramatic Club, along with the other groups at the time including Masquers, Garrick, the Player, Paint and Patches, and Pi Upsilon Delta all participated in activities there. In 1923 Punchinello re-established itself on the St. Paul Campus with the name change. In the early years, the Agricultural Dramatic Club performed around the state. After World War I, those specific activities ended, but Punchinello continued to tour for different reasons over the years. North Hall Punchinello moved to North Hall (formerly the St. Paul Campus Dining Hall) in the 1960s, while O. Meredith Wilson was president. Punchinello operated out of various spaces until then. Besides the Main Building Auditorium, their main location for a period in the 1950s was the 'Punchinello Playhouse' which had room for an audience of 140 in a theater-in-the-round setting, and was situated in a post-war temporary building referred to variously as 'south of Administration' and 'temporary south of Haecker.' Punchinello had no permanent home in all that time. Wilson became aware of that, and he felt that something better could be arranged. Soon, Punchinello had a new home. The cafeteria area became the stage and audience area with seating for 119. The proctor balcony over the cafeteria became the lighting/sound booth. The green rooms behind the stage were spacious. Rooms on the second floor were used for costumes. A cavernous area in the basement (the dungeon) was used for large and small props and set pieces. ==Chronology== The first committed, long-term faculty advisor of Punchinello was William J. Routledge (Rhetoric Professor at the University Farm) who coached the organization from the late 1920s through till the 1940–1941 school year.\\"The Gopher: Annual Publication of the Student Body of the University of Minnesota\\", Volume 45, Minneapolis, Minnesota. University of Minnesota, 1922, Page 484.\\"The Minnesota Alumni Weekly\\", Volume 23, Number 9, Minneapolis, Minnesota. University of Minnesota, 11/22/23 Page 63. Performances during this period had varied structures, often featured live musical performances before the show and/or between acts, and productions included actors, faculty, and the Faculty Women's Club. Organizational boundaries were flexible as well - some productions were campus-wide, and students were often active in multiple groups. A production of Kismet in 1925 by the Masquers' included members of multiple theaters, including Players, Paint and Patches, and Punchinello; and production was further aided by members of the Arabs - the engineering dramatic society. Starting with the 1941–1942 school year, Dr. Francis Drake was Faculty Advisor and often show Director, but Punchinello - like many University organizations - was largely dormant during World War II.\\"The University of Minnesota Directory of Student Organizations\\", Minneapolis, Minnesota. University of Minnesota Student Activities Bureau, Office of the Dean of Students, published annually\\"The 1942 Gopher\\" Yearbook, Minneapolis, Minnesota. University of Minnesota Student Body, Vol 55. 1942. P. 212 Punchinello's faculty advisor and frequent production director for over three decades was William M. Marchand, Humanities Professor of the Rhetoric Department, CFANS. Bill Marchand had a PhD in theatre, and prior to coming to the University in 1960 he had co-founded the Paul Bunyan Theatre, a summer theatre in Bemidji. ==Theater Genre== Punchinello mainly performed traditional classics as well as some musicals, and the occasional newer work. Among the rare melodrama/related productions were Kind Lady by Edward Chodorov, in 1942. and Dracula (from the novel by Bram Stoker) in 1969. Comedies have included Square Crooks in 1929, Dover Road by A.A. Milne in 1936, Arms and the Man by George Bernard Shaw in 1954, Harvey by Mary Chase in 1958, The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde in 1973 and Hay Fever by Noël Coward in 1978. Punchinello received positive reviews for its production of Machiavelli's La Mangragola in 1968. Punch produced the metatheatrical play Our Town by Thornton Wilder in 1969. Punchinello often explored social issues, with sell- out productions such as The Crucible by Arthur Miller and Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett in 1964 and in 1983, as well as lesser known works including Play with a Tiger by Doris Lessing in 1979 and Shadow Box by Michael Cristofer in 1982. The students who were involved often were sometimes but not always theater majors, representing the range of disciplines within the University. ==Finale== Its final two productions continued that tradition: William Saroyan's The Time of Your Life was the second-to-last production. The final production, directed by William Marchand, was Thornton Wilder's Our Town. ==See also== * History of Saint Paul, Minnesota * Rarig Center ==Notes * Cook, Estelle. (1915).

The structure was created on the basis of the State Service of Medical Forensic Expertise, expert divisions of law enforcement bodies, emergency departments and units, the Armed Forces and expert units of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Belarus. Formed on April 22, 2013, began its operations on July 1, 2013. The chairman of the SFEC RB is Andrei Shved. == History== For the first time, the issue of reforming the system of state forensic institutions in the Republic of Belarus was addressed in 1992, but the adoption of the final decision was preceded by a large-scale work. As a result, during the reform of the judicial and expert system, the special procedural status of the expert and the importance of his conclusion for establishing the truth in criminal, administrative, civil and economic cases were placed at the center of the issue. The basis for the establishment of the State Forensic Examination Committee was: * expert forensic units of law enforcement bodies; * The State Service of Medical Forensic Expertise, including its Regional and Minsk Departments; * State Institution \\"80 Central Military Forensic Laboratory\\" of the Ministry of Defense; * Research and Emergency Situations Expertise Department of the Center for Standardization and Expertise in the Field of Protection of the Population and Territories from Emergency Situations of the Institution “Scientific-Research Institute of Fire Safety and Problems of Emergency Situations” of the Ministry for Emergency Situations, the unit (group) for the operation of the state system for the prevention and liquidation of emergency situations and civil defense, research, expertise of emergency situations and fires of scientific and practical centers of regional (Minsk city) departments of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, department of research and expertise fires institution \\"Scientific-Research Center of the Vitebsk regional department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic of Belarus\\"; * State institution \\"Center for Forensic Expertise and Criminalistics of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Belarus\\".

Mainländer saw the purification of Schopenhauer's philosophy as the task of his life. The criticism had an important impact on Nietzsche's philosophical development. ==General overview== The Critique of the Schopenhauerian philosophy is generally seen as offering a position closer to realism than the idealism of Kant and Schopenhauer. Mainländer aims to free the philosophy of Schopenhauer from its metaphysical tendencies. It is the longest criticism of Schopenhauer's work, and it earned him the praise of Frauenstädt, \\"apostle primarie\\" of Schopenhauer, Max Seiling and Frederick C. Beiser for being one of the most talented followers of Schopenhauer. == Epistemology == Background of the critical philosophy Locke had referred all philosophical research to the domain of experience. He argued that the mind is empty at birth, and that all knowledge stems from experience. This was an important step in philosophy, yet, by accepting this important problems arise. The most famous challenge came from Hume, namely, if all knowledge is derived from experience we have no right to claim things are caused, we can only perceive that they follow after each other. Berkeley also noted that all that is given to us are subjective sensations, and Thomas Reid expounded this further by demonstrating that the mere sensations of the senses bear no resemblance to objective qualities, such as extension, figure, number. Kant determined that although Locke was right to assert that all knowledge begins with experience, it does not follow that all knowledge arises from experience. The mind has forms in which it pours, so to speak, experience. These forms that lie in us are causality (amongst other categories), space and time. G.E. Schulze had argued that Kant's proof that causality must be an inborn concept is invalid. Schopenhauer and Mainländer agreed with Schulze that the attempt of Kant was totally unsuccessful. Causality It was therefore up to those who were loyal to Kant’s project to secure the validity of causality. As Hume’s skepticism is based on the assumption that causality is a concept drawn from successive external representations, Schopenhauer started to investigate how we actually come to know external representations. After all, all that is given to me are subjective sensations, sense data that go not beyond my skin. So how is it possible to perceive something beyond my skin, outside of me? Mainländer praises this as an exceptional sign of prudence. The senses merely deliver the data, which is processed by the brain into the objective world by means of the understanding, which conceives every change in a sense organ as the effect of an external cause, and seeks the cause in space. Hereby, for the first time it is shown how the visible world arises from sense data. Schopenhauer called this comprehension of a change in the sense organ having a cause in space, the causal law (German: Kausalitätsgesetz). Schopenhauer deemed that he had thereby disproven Hume’s skepticism, since representations presuppose the causal law. Causality is consequently not a concept drawn from successive representations, but representations presuppose knowledge of causality. The causal law does not cover causality in general. This reasoning is too hastily made (a subreption). Schopenhauer has indeed shown that the causal law is needed for objective perception and consequently lies a priori in us, but not that causality in general must lie a priori in us. The causal law merely says: every change in my sense organ is the effect of a cause. It is a one-sided relation (the outer world affects me) of the subject that says nothing about objects affecting each other. The causal law does not cover causality in general. In order to do anything else than searching the cause of an effect, we need another mental faculty. Reason reflects and recognizes that I am not a privileged subject but an object amongst objects, so with help of experience it subjects all appearances to the general law: wherever in nature a change takes place, it is the effect of a cause, which preceded it in time. Causality is therefore given a posteriori and not a priori, though it has an aprioristic ground. Transcendental Analytic According to Schopenhauer the only mental faculty needed for the creation of the outer world is the understanding. The reason merely draws concepts from the objective world, reflects on it, but in no way helps to construct it. Kant however, maintained that there are inborn concepts, categories, and that they are needed to make from “the chaos of appearances”, the manifold given in perception, an objectively valid connection called nature. Schopenhauer has shown that only due to the understanding we can know external objects, by moving the sensation in the sense organ outwards. This is its only function. So the understanding gives us many external representations, though it does not know how they are connected amongst each other. Schopenhauer illegitimately claimed that causality in general is the function of the understanding. Consequently, his explanation that the understanding can know that different partial- representations come from one object does not hold. For example, if I stand before a lamppost and first behold its lower part, and then move my eyes to its top; then my understanding has first moved the sensation in my eye outwards to see its lower part, and has, after that, done the same with the top; but it does not deduce that the sensations come from one object, since its only function is moving the sensation outwards. It has merely given me partial-representations. This observation forms, in the Critique of Pure Reason, the heart of the Transcendental Analytic. Kant writes: This synthesis forms the main topic of the Analytic, and it is very important to never lose sight of the concerned issue, that partial-representations delivered by the senses need a mental faculty before appearing as connected in the mind: And holding onto this important observation, it makes clear that the categories are a secondary issue in the Analytic. The categories are necessary as fixed rules for the subject in its conjoinment of partial-representations: otherwise the subject would arbitrarily conjoin whatever appears, and no sustained object could be perceived. In other words, Kant needed the categories because there is (according to his teaching) no coercion coming from the reality-in- itself to perceive this or that object, to conjoin the lower and upper part of the lamppost into one object. So the coercion to see sustained objects (and a world with natural laws) comes according to Kant solely from the subject. This \\"absurd\\" reasoning which Kant had to make, is not needed when we comprehend the activity which brings forth homogenous partial-representations as coming from the same thing-in-itself. The activity of a tree-in-itself would, when we behold its lower part, provide us the sensation that leads to the partial- representation of its lower part, and when we behold the upper part the corresponding partial-representation. Judgement-power can determine that the activity originates from one unity (the tree-in-itself) and reason conjoins them. This way, the coercion stems from reality-in-itself instead of the subject. Space and time Kant had argued that space and time lie as infinite magnitudes inborn in us, and are forms of our sensibility. Schopenhauer accepted this characterization of space and time, as did many neo-Kantians: it was frequently praised as one of the greatest events in philosophy. The theory of relativity eroded the value of the Aesthetic, as it proved to be incompatible with relativity, famously causing neo-Kantians to write A Hundred Authors against Einstein. A few critical followers of Kant were skeptical from the beginning, Afrikan Spir and Mainländer noted, independently from each other, that the Aesthetic is self-contradicting, and Mainländer maintains that Kant was conscious of this, as Kant redefines the nature of space and time in the Analytic. In the Analytic Kant makes a distinction between form of perception (German: Anschauung) and pure perception. Time and mathematical space are no longer forms of perception, but are the synthesis of a manifold which sensibility offers in its original receptivity. Kant is silent about what this manifold of the original receptivity of sensibility is. The investigation of Mainländer gives as result that these inborn forms are, instead, point-space and the present (point- time). Time and mathematical spaces are subjective creations a posteriori. Mainländer saw it as the greatest merit of Kant to show that space and time are subjective. However, space and time do not readily lie in us, to bring forth properties such as extension and motion, but are subjective preconditions to cognize them. Extension does not depend upon space. Because Kant and Schopenhauer automatically assumed that extension and space are equivalent concepts, by showing that space exists only for a perceiver, they had to deny that extension exists independently from a perceiver. Mainländer thus distinguished between proper length and length as it is perceived. Here, Mainländer not only circumvented the contradiction with relativity of Kant- Schopenhauer, but also came to a result that surprisingly complies with special relativity, which teaches us that length as it is perceived is subjective: it is dependent on the velocity of the observer and the proper length of the object that is perceived. :L=L_{0}\\\\sqrt{1-v^{2}/c^{2}} where : is the proper length, : is the length observed by an observer in relative motion with respect to the object, : is the relative velocity between the observer and the moving object, : is the speed of light. The separation of space as it is observed and proper length seemed to have no meaning before the discovery of relativity: in a time with only Newtonian mechanics it seemed to many as a superfluous distinction. As a consequence, not realizing why this would be of any importance, contemporaries of Mainländer accused his philosophy of simply being realism contrary to his own claims. (Plümacher, Von Hartmann) Time is likewise subjective though nothing without its real underlay. It is its “subjective measuring rod.” == Ontology == According to Mainländer, Schopenhauer found the only path that leads to the thing-in- itself. Yet, though we know the will without the forms of space and causality, under the influence of Kant's transcendental aesthetic, Schopenhauer deems that we know the will under the form of our inner sensibility, time, which implies that we know not the will as it is in itself. This would mean that we can never determine anything about the essence of the world, and Schopenhauer uses this result to continue with obscure metaphysics. Mainländer maintains that, since time is not a form of our inner sensibility, we can know the thing-in-itself completely and nakedly. == Aesthetics == Although Mainländer considers Schopenhauer's works on art to be brilliant and spirited, they are often based on pure metaphysics. Schopenhauer reintroduces Plato's theory of forms and calls Platonic Ideas the first and most universal form of objects without the subordinate forms of the phenomenon. Mainländer comments that this is a meaningless combination of words. thumb Head of Christ by Antonio da Correggio Kant and Schopenhauer briefly discuss the sublime character, but only mention characteristics that explain not its essence. Just like how the feeling of the sublime stems from overcoming the fear of death in a situation where the individual normally would feel endangered, though it is merely self- deception, sublimity inheres the individual if it permanently has contempt of death. Mainländer mentions three classes of sublime characters. To the first class belong those who still love life, but care no longer about their individual weal as they fight for a higher ideal (the freedom of a nation, social rights, emancipation), in a word, heroes. To the second class belong those who are convinced of the worthlessness of life, and this conviction has made them immune to all worldly affairs. Saints and wise philosophers such as Spinoza belong to this class. The third class belongs to those who are sublime in the highest degree: the ascetic human who returns to the world, without making any concession, only to free the world from suffering. That they gain thereby adulation during life and deification after death leaves them cold and indifferent. Buddha and Christ fill up this class. Because the wise hero is the most sublime appearance in this world, the greatest geniuses have tried to portray it in art. Two exceptional works Mainländer highlights are Eschenbach’s Parzival and Corregio’s Head of Christ. == Ethics == Schopenhauer called Kant's distinction between the empirical and intelligible character \\"one of the most beautiful and most profound thought products of this great mind\\". It claims that although all appearances act in a determined manner, it is the subject who issued these laws of nature: they owe their existence and necessity to the subject. Therefore, as thing-in-itself, we must be free, though it is a transcendental freedom which we cannot comprehend. Mainländer argues that this distinction follows only because of errors in epistemology, since Kant and Schopenhauer believed that all coercion stems from the subject, instead of the things-in-themselves. Schopenhauer used this transcendental freedom to legitimize the negation of motives, quietives, which finds its expression in asceticism. Hereby Schopenhauer shows that compassion is not the basis of morality, since saintliness is not motivated by compassion. A saint who is worried about his immortal soul and flees to deserts, is indeed no longer sensitive to worldly motives, but only because a stronger motive crushes them. == Metaphysics == As every aspect of Schopenhauer's metaphysics has been discussed throughout the critique, Mainländer ends instead with a selection of religious texts, that show that the essence of Schopenhauer’s philosophy, Christianity and Buddhism is one: the absolute truth. ==References== Category:Arthur Schopenhauer ","title":"Critique of the Schopenhauerian philosophy"},{"id":"56048167","text":"The H.F.

Her parents were Anne and Balthazar Ursler. The Urslers exhibited her at shows, but also educated their daughter. She later married Johan Michael van Beck and became Barbara van Beck. The couple had one child and her husband became her manager. He reportedly married her for the purposes of making money through his wife's appearance in shows. ==Public appearances== Barbara van Beck became internationally renowned and travelled Europe, appearing in shows. In 1655, van Beck travelled to London for the first time. In 1657, John Evelyn recorded seeing her at a show with other notable performers of the period. He wrote that she \\"played well on the harpsichord.\\" Evelyn's friend Samuel Pepys described having seen a woman with a similar condition in subsequent diaries, and there is debate over whether this is the same individual. Barbara van Beck made a public appearance in Beauvais in 1660. An etching of her portrait by Richard Gaywood was used to advertise this show, and a copy was sent to local authorities to obtain permission for the show. By this point, van Beck was already becoming a celebrity: her request to appear notes that she had already received attention in Paris (where she had appeared in 1645) and other French cities. In 1668, van Beck appeared in London and was seen by Holger Jacobsen who wrote about her for Thomas Bartholin's book Acta Medica et Philosophica Hafnensis. He was struck by the length and softness of her hair, and reported examining her genitals to see whether they resembled those of a monkey. After 1668, there are no mentions of van Beck, and some have speculated that she may have died in this year. ==Condition== Barbara van Beck is believed to have had the condition hypertrichosis, also called Ambras syndrome. ==Depictions== Engravings of van Beck were made by several engravers. H. Winze presented her standing, full- length in 1638. Isaac Brunnin depicted her in 1653 and Richard Gaywood showed her with her left hand on an organ with information about her birth and personal life. Engraver William Richardson created an engraving of her playing a harpsichord. A 1640s portrait of van Beck depicts her \\"wearing an expensive silk gown, with a fashionable, low neckline\\". Historian Angela McShane observed that \\"this is a beautifully executed high-status painting\\", and highlights that depictions of van Beck differ from later Victorian images of \\"freaks\\". ==References== Category:Year of death unknown Category:1629 births Category:People with hypertrichosis Category:17th-century women Category:17th- century German people ","title":"Barbara van Beck"},{"id":"56048457","text":"The Regional Mexican Albums, published in Billboard magazine, is a record chart that features Latin music sales information for regional styles of Mexican music.

Created by Shelly Altman and Jean Passanante, and introduced by executive producer Frank Valentini, Nelle is portrayed by actress Chloe Lanier, who made her first appearance on August 8, 2016. ==Development== Creation and casting General Hospital was planning to cast another actress to portray the role of Nelle Hayes, as Lanier was involved with another series, Kingdom at that time, but Laura Wright and Frank Valentini were adamant that Lanier was right for the role, so the storyline was put on hold until the actress became available. Lanier revealed to Soap Opera Digest that \\"Frank Valentini had called her personally and convinced her to do it. Which she's very happy that he did, because they were able to work out a deal, so she could do other projects on her time off which she's thankful for.\\" On July 12, 2016, Soaps In Depth officially announced that actress Lanier, who previously portrayed the role of the Patricia Spencer for the 52nd anniversary, would be returning to the serial in the newly-created role of Nelle. The information about her character was a mystery, as the serial stayed tight-lipped about the character and her connection to Port Charles. About Nelle's future, Lanier says \\"It will definitely take more than easy facts & logic to shift the dynamic, because Nelle grew up in a cult, being brainwashed by her father from an early age.\\" In June 2018, it was announced that Lanier had opted to not renew her deal with the serial, and would exit the role. Lanier departed on August 7, 2018. Lanier briefly reprised the role for a \\"short-term stint,\\" from October 12 to 15, 2018. On November 1, 2018, it was reported that Lanier will be making more appearances on the show. Lanier appeared on November 8, 2018. She also made an appearance on December 26, 2018. In May of the following year, Soaps.com announced that Lanier would reprise the role, beginning June 13. Willa Rose portrayed a young Nelle in flashback scenes for the April 8, 2020, episode. In September 2020, Lanier exited the role. Characterization A casting call was released for a General Hospital female character in her early 20s who is described as being \\"charismatic, dynamic and fiery.\\" Any ethnicity actress was asked to audition for the role. According to Lanier, \\"As much as her character mostly has it out for Carly, Nelle has a good heart, and isn't entirely vicious and evil.\\" Introduction She was introduced as a school teacher whose kidney was sold on the black market in order to save her niece, Josslyn's life. There were speculations that she would be related to Pat Spencer since she previously played the younger version of her, but in March 2017, it was revealed that she is the daughter of Frank Benson and the adopted half-sister of Carly Corinthos. ==Storylines== Nelle arrives in Port Charles in early August 2016 looking for Carly Corinthos (Wright). She meets her at the Corinthos' house, Greystone Manor, during the birthday party of Bobbie Spencer (Jacklyn Zeman), and informs her about being her daughter, Josslyn's (Eden McCoy) kidney donor. When Carly asks for proof, she becomes upset and tells them she's not here for money. Sonny and Jax don't believe her, and inform her about Carly being conned for money before. Nelle reacts badly and leaves. Michael goes after her and convinces her to stay, she meets Joss when she approaches her, and they briefly bond after Nelle assists her with an app. After Joss leaves, Michael and Nelle head back to Corinthos house, agreeing to go to the hospital for the tests and is confirmed to be the donor. Joss learns the truth about Nelle being the one who saved her life and thanks her with a hug. Carly and Joss ask her to stay in Port Charles so they can get to know her. She starts working for Carly as her stepdaughter, Avery Corinthos' nanny, after the previous nanny gets fired for stealing Carly's earrings. Nelle loses her job after Bobbie offers to look after Avery. So Carly offers her a job of a personal assistant at the Metro Court Hotel which she accepts. In November 2016, she drugs Sonny and leads him to believe he had sex with her, as party of her revenge plot against Carly. Nelle struggles with her guilt, however, but continues to conspire against Carly at Sonny's expense. In early 2017, Michael convinces Nelle to bury the hatred and focus on her future; she listens to him, and decides to stop scheming so she and Michael can be together and she can finally be happy. She deletes the recording after Michael leaves, but when she goes to Carly's office to destroy the package that contained the recording, Bobbie confronts her about her nasty doings. She goes to see Michael so she can tell him the truth, but they got interrupted, so when they go to her apartment for privacy they find his parents there who expose Nelle. When Michael asks for the truth, Nelle admits everything, but blames Carly for it. She reveals being Frank Benson's daughter, and how Carly called her father for her kidney when her daughter got sick when she never cared about them. Carly denies it and says she thought it was Jake Webber's kidney which Nelle refuses to believe. Sonny and Michael try to explain to Nelle that her own father screwed her over and not Carly, but she doesn't listen to them. After Carly and Sonny leave, Michael stays back and gives Nelle an ear full before leaving. Nelle starts packing her things, so she can move out from the apartment given to her by Carly. That's when Joss shows up with the concert tickets, but Nelle blows her off and goes for a drink at The Floating Rib where she runs into Michael who tells her he will never forgive her for hurting his parents. Jax then meets her somewhere, and Nelle learns through him that her father used her after he shows her proof and she realizes everything. She tries to make things right by confessing to Sonny that they didn't sleep together, and later on confesses to Carly as well, but to no avail. After hearing what she has to say, Carly kicks her out of her house. Since she no longer had a job, Nina Reeves (Michelle Stafford) hires her as a full-time nanny for Charlotte Cassadine (Scarlett Fernandez). When Jasper gets arrested for buying Nelle's kidney illegally, she goes to the station and makes a statement about not wanting to press charges, so the charges get dropped for which Jasper thanks her. When Jasper leaves, Carly thanks Nelle, but then asks her to stay away from her family especially Michael. She asks Carly \\"when will it ever be enough for you to forgive me?\\" To which Carly replies it doesn't change what she did and she won't forgive her. Afterwards, Michael arrives at the station and misjudges Nelle, offering her a compensation if she doesn't press charges, oblivious that she saved Jax. When he learns the truth, he meets her at the docks while she's waiting for a boat to Wyndemere and apologizes to her. Nina presses her into spying on her husband, Valentin who she suspects is keeping secrets from her. In June 2017, Nina hires Nelle to work as her executive assistant at Crimson; despite this, Nelle is later fired by Nina. When Michaels breaks up with Nelle, she admits she is pregnant with his baby. Nelle is later hired by Ava Jerome (Maura West) to work at the Jerome Gallery. Angered by her own belief that it was Carly's doing that led to her split from Michael, Nelle begins to manipulate Carly, in the hopes of making her lose her mind, by making anonymous calls near the site where Morgan Corinthos (Bryan Craig) died. During her baby shower, Nelle fell down a flight of stairs at the Quartermaine Mansion after getting into an argument with Carly, similar to the situation that happened to Carly years ago, when she lost her child on the same stairs. In late 2018, she was visited by Charlotte's soon-to-be great-aunt Liesl Obrecht (Kathleen Gati) in prison after Nelle's male counterpart Peter August (Wes Ramsey) became the new owner of The Invader tabloid. In late 2019, when Brad visited her in Pentonville prison, she requested him to let her be a part of her son's life once she's out of prison after she met convicted serial killer Ryan Chamberlain (Jon Lindstrom). The following year, Nelle is given an early release from Pentonville, and reveals herself as the widow of Shiloh who bore a striking resemblance to the late Nathan West (Ryan Paevey). With her status as Shiloh's widow, she uses her proxy to sell her shares of ELQ to Valentin Cassadine (James Patrick Stuart) and begins to assert herself as Wiley's mother, much to the dismay and objection of the residents of Port Charles. When she hears of Brad and Lucas' decision to leave Port Charles with Wiley, she attempts to kidnap him, however, she is stopped by Michael and Chase. It is hinted that Nelle is the long-lost daughter of Nina (Cynthia Watros), having possession of the baby rattle and half-heart necklace that Nina possesses, but has yet to be confirmed as of 8/2020. In May 2020, Nelle marries Julian Jerome (William deVry). In August, after kidnapping Wiley and going on the run, Michael tracked them down to a cabin, but Nelle took off into the woods. Following a showdown with Carly, Nelle fell off a cliff. Carly tried to save her, but it was too late. == References  External links == *Nelle Hayes profile - SoapCentral.com *http://soaps.sheknows.com/general-hospital/characters/nelle- hayes Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional adoptees Category:General Hospital characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2016 ","title":"Nelle Benson"},{"id":"56048512","text":"Nachyn Sergeyevich Kuular (; born 9 June 1995 in Tuva republic) is a breakdancerhttp://www.trk7.ru/tvprogramm/sportivnyy-club/74821/ and freestyle wrestler from Russia of Tuvin heritage.

He apprenticed as a cabinet maker, and moved to Lexington, Michigan in 1849, gaining employment with Woods and Sanburn, general merchants. In 1853, he went into business for himself. He soon invested in the local lumber resources, and moved to what is now Port Hope in 1857, one of the first pioneers in the area. He bought or took out lumber claims on a great deal of the surrounding timberland. In 1858, a lumber mill was built and men moved into the area to work in the mill. As the lumber business boomed, the town of Port Hope began to grow around the mill. Stafford also operated one of the largest and most complete salt blocks in the state, making his fortune shipping both salt and lumber. In 1866, Stafford began to construct this house in Port Hope. The house took two years to complete, and the Staffords moved in on Christmas Eve, 1868. The house stayed in the family, passing on 1936 to Mr. & Mrs. Reginald Smith; Mrs. Smith was the granddaughter of William Stafford. ==Description== The Stafford House is a two-story Italianate structure with a three-story central cupola.

'Giant' by Lindley in A synopsis of the British Flora; arranged according to the Natural Orders (1829), without description. At the time, the taxon Ulmus montana was used both for Wych Elm cultivars and for those of Ulmus × hollandica. Lindley appeared to distinguish \\"the Giant elm\\" from \\"the Chichester elm\\", while in Australia, where it was introduced in the late 19th century, Ulmus montana 'Canadian Giant' was distinguished from Huntingdon Elm. These pairings suggest that 'Canadian Giant' may have been a 'Vegeta'-type hybrid, rather than a wych cultivar, though possibly not synonymous with 'Vegeta' or 'Cicestria'. It is not known how or when 'Canadian' was added to Lindley's 'Giant elm', but the epithet may be related to the fact that the horticulturalist William Barron, who distributed the elm as 'Giant' or 'Canadensis' (see 'Cultivation'), was head gardener at Elvaston Castle in Derbyshire to Charles Stanhope, 4th Earl of Harrington whose father, the third earl, had served in the Canadian wars. ==Description== U. montana 'Canadian Giant', described as \\"rather more spreading than the ordinary form\\" of U. montana, was noted for its fast growth. In Australia it was said to be more vigorous than Huntingdon Elm (\\"the fastest grower of the elms in Sydney except the 'Canadian Giant'\\").The agricultural gazette of New South Wales, 2 October 1908, p.785 The Gembrook or Nobelius Nursery 1918 catalogue described 'Canadian Elm' as \\"a good street tree of rapid growth\\", listing it separately from Chichester Elm and Huntingdon Elm.

In this process Giuliano Pisapia, a former mayor of Milan, launched the Progressive Camp (CP) and long pondered the possibility of leading the proposed list, including minor established parties, assorted leftists and, most notably, former members of Left Ecology Freedom (SEL) – which had been folded into the more radical Italian Left (SI). In December, after Pisapia's retirement and the dissolution of the CP, Riccardo Nencini, Angelo Bonelli and Giulio Santagata, respectively leaders of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), the Federation of the Greens (FdV) and Civic Area (AC), launched Together in order to participate in the 2018 general election as a part of the centre-left coalition, along with More Europe (+Eu) and the Popular Civic List (CP). Together's logo was styled on that of The Olive Tree, a broad centre-left coalition active from 1995 to 2007 (when its main components were merged into the PD). Some of Pisapia's followers launched the Progressive Area (AP) and looked set to join Together, However, after tensions with Together leaders, it was announced that AP had signed an agreement with +Eu, already composed of the Italian Radicals, Forza Europa and the Democratic Centre, also with the centre-left. In the election the list obtained a mere 0.6% of the vote and no seats. However, two of its members elected in single- seat constituencies: Nencini (PSI) to the Senate in Arezzo and Serse Soverini (AC) to the Chamber in Imola.

It was broadcast on BBC1 between 21 November and 24 December 1984. The series was adapted from Masefield's novel by Alan Seymour, directed by Renny Rye and produced by Paul Stone. The series is a fantasy adventure about a schoolboy who is entrusted with a magical box which allows him to time travel and shapeshift to protect the box from an evil magician. An innovative mixture of live action and animation, the production made extensive use of the Quantel Paintbox and chroma key effects. The series cost £1 million to make in 1984 (£ in ), the most expensive children's series the BBC had made to that date, but it was widely acclaimed and won a number of BAFTA and RTS awards, in particular for its special effects. ==Production== John Masefield was the Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom between 1930 and his death in 1967, but alongside his poetry he also wrote books for children. The Box of Delights: or When the Wolves Were Running, published in 1935, was the sequel to his 1927 book The Midnight Folk. Masefield's novel had been adapted by the BBC for radio several times; a six-part adaptation, with a script by Robert Holland and John Keir Cross, was produced three times as part of its Children's Hour with different casts in 1943, 1948 and 1955. A new radio adaptation by John Keir Cross had been produced for Saturday Night Theatre in 1966, then remade with a new cast in 1977. Producer Paul Stone had a longstanding ambition to create \\"the ultimate in children's drama\\" after discovering Masefield's 1935 novel The Box of Delights in the 1970s. Stone told Books for Keeps: \\"as soon as I read it I wanted to make it for television. It's an amazing and singular mixture of adventure story and poetic myth and the writing is packed with visual imagery...television is uniquely able to translate those qualities from one medium to another\\". It took Stone ten years to obtain the rights and to get the green light on the production. There had been plans to make a Hollywood feature film of the book, so the rights had to be re-negotiated with the Masefield Trust, who administered the author's estate. Stone said in an interview with the Radio Times that this delay was \\"a blessing\\" since the story \\"call[ed] for feats of animation which television simply couldn't realise five, perhaps even two or three years ago.\\" Director Renny Rye was at that time on staff in the BBC Children's department at Television Centre, but had previous experience from the drama department, so was chosen by Edward Barnes to direct what would be what would be one of their most ambitious children's dramas to date. With a large number of effects shots, coupled with extensive location filming, the production was the most expensive children's drama the BBC had yet created, costing more than £1 million in 1984. Visual effects Patrick Troughton, as Cole Hawlings, demonstrates the Box of Delights to Kay Harker. For this effects shot, eleven separate video inputs were required using Colour Separation Overlay to add the actors (in a blue studio) onto a 'snow vortex' background; separate video inputs were required for the Quantel Paintbox which added the encroaching slow-motion background, which had been shot on location several months earlier. The production featured an ambitious number of visual effects for its day, particularly the combining of real actors and hand-drawn animation in the Herne the Hunter scenes. These effects were supervised by Tony Harding (visual effects designer) and Robin Lobb (video effects). Paul Stone told the Radio Times that the programme featured \\"new sophistications of colour separation overlay, of the electronic 'paintbox' and the Quantel technologies.\\" The latter allowed the shrinking of the actor to one-twentieth of the original image size, allowing Kay to shrink to a toy boat or Cole to disappear into a painting. Colour Separation Overlay (the BBC's term for chroma keying) had been in use at the Corporation since the 1970s, but had not been used to the extent of The Box of Delights. Unlike the more common green screen used for digital effects, CSO used blue as the primary keying colour. When production began, Rye recalls that this process could only be created live in a studio, so the composite background and foreground images had to be fed through a desk. The Visual Effects team designed a system which took a black and white key of the foreground subject at the same time, meaning that images taken some time apart could be combined in post-production. Rye recalls \\"This was the biggest leap forward technically at the time. It meant that a lot of the things I couldn’t work out how to do I could suddenly do. The post-production process took six months, aided by the BBC developing a new effects studio at Television Centre. The staff were able to use the programme as a test bed for new technology. For example, the Ampex Digital Optics (ADO) machine was purchased for the studio shortly after post-production work began meaning that they would zoom composite video sources during flying sequences. Rye recalls for one effects shot in episode 2 \\"we had to link up eleven separate inputs into this video studio. Seven or eight of them were video machines, which were downstairs. We were taking machines away from Match of the Day highlights and Top of the Pops, which were being made at the same time, to feed images in to create one image.\\" Locations Railway station scenes were filmed at and on the steam heritage Severn Valley Railway; Tewkesbury became the fictional Tatchester; the bishop's children's party was recorded at Kinlet Hall, Shropshire (the location of Moffats Independent School, whose pupils and staff served as extras); the interior of Hereford Cathedral and its choir were featured extensively in the final episode (although the exterior of \\"Tatchester Cathedral\\" was Tewkesbury Abbey). Exterior shots of Abner Brown's theological college were filmed at Eastnor Castle, near Ledbury, Herefordshire. The snowy mountainous landscape of King Arthur's castle was filmed at the Peel of Lumphanan, Lumphanan, Aberdeenshire. During filming, the crew were almost snowed in by 12-foot blizzards. Renny Rye recalls: \\"We could hardly use any of the locations I'd recced because we couldn't get out of the hotel. Nearly all the locations were unreachable because the snow was so thick (which is why it looks quite magical in the film), so virtually all of it was shot in the hotel gardens.\\" Music The opening and closing title music features an orchestral arrangement of \\"The First Nowell\\" extracted from the third movement of the Carol Symphony (Andante quasi lento e contabile) by Victor Hely-Hutchinson. The movement had previously been used for the 1940s Children's Hour radio adaptation and has become synonymous with the story. Hely-Hutchinson wrote his Carol Symphony in 1927, and had a long association with the BBC, eventually becoming its Director of Music in 1944 until his death aged 45 during the harsh winter of 1947 when he caught pneumonia as a result of refusing to turn on the heating in his office. Jon Jacob notes describes the work's suitability for the titles: \\"It's not immediately obvious what we're listening to at the beginning...one steady note in the strings hangs in the air; a harp creates an eerie music-box effect. A counter-melody joins soon after. A vague sense of menace threatens to overpower...The unsettling feeling doesn't last for long: it's resolved with the quietest of bassoons playing one suspended note transforming the moment into a quiet triumph and, the introduction of a familiar carol – The First Noel.\\" The recording used in the 1984 adaption was from a 1966 EMI recording (LP catalogue No. ESD 7021) featuring the Pro Arte Orchestra conducted by Barry Rose. Incidental music is by Roger Limb of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop using a combination of orchestral and synthesised instruments. Tom Urges notes that Limb's incidental music \\"adds to the heady mix of ancient and modern, of reality and fantasy, and builds on the atmosphere we are prepared for as viewers by one of the best choices of theme music in the history of British TV.\\" ==Casting== To play Kay Harker, the main child protagonist, two hundred children were auditioned. Director Renny Rye recalls: \\"My purist notion was that children's imagination was so great they could do it better if they hadn't been tutored. So I went round lots of schools and saw children from many, many schools.\\" Devin Stanfield was chosen on account of having \\"a good face without seeming too modern or too handsome...the demands of filming called for someone with a great deal of stamina [with] a ready imagination, especially as he'd be called upon to react to invisible delights that would only afterwards be electronically added to the film.\\" Stanfield was the grandson of the actor Leslie Sands and had previously had a few small parts in television programmes. The kindly Punch and Judy man Cole Hawlings was played by Patrick Troughton, famous for his portrayal of the Second Doctor in Doctor Who between 1966 and 1969. Renny Rye said that Troughton \\"was my favourite Doctor Who...[he] had a quality that is unsurpassed, I think, as someone to pull you into a tale.\\" A Blue Peter feature at the time connected Cole Hawlings to the actor's earlier role, observing that Troughton was once again playing a mysterious, scruffy time traveller. Robert Stephens was cast to play the sinister antagonist Abner Brown. He recalled hearing the 1948 BBC Radio production on Children's Hour when he was seventeen and was so thrilled to be asked to appear in the television version he replied \\"Of course - for nothing!\\" Stephens said that he enjoyed the novel's depiction of the \\"magician and gangster\\" Abner dressing as a clergyman, since it upset the expectations of the audience. In a review for Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe, Rhys Thomas said that Stephens \\"put so much into it...he doesn't camp it up and make it funny, he's just really frightening.\\" Stephens’ partner and future wife, Patricia Quinn best known for The Rocky Horror Picture Show was cast as Brown's own partner in crime, Sylvia Daisy Pouncer.

The current owner of the box is an old Punch and Judy man called Cole Hawlings (Patrick Troughton) whom Kay meets at the railway station. They develop an instant rapport, which leads Cole to confide that he is being chased by a magician called Abner Brown (Robert Stephens) and his gang, which includes Kay's former governess. The box allows the owner to shrink in size, to shapeshift, to fly, to travel to the past and to experience various magical wonders and creatures, and thus is sought for evil purposes by Abner. Cole (who turns out to be the medieval philosopher and alleged magician Ramon Llull) entrusts the box to Kay. The schoolboy then goes on to have many adventures across time as he protects the box from Abner Brown. During his travels, Kay encounters many characters drawn from English folklore, history and pagan mythology including Herne the Hunter, King Arthur, Father Christmas, unicorns, Roman soldiers and medieval monks. Jenny Shirt of \\"We Are Cult\\" notes that The Box of Delights features a recurring \\"motif of the intertwining of paganism and Christianity\\". Episodes The series was first shown in six half-hour episodes in November and December 1984.

The Royal Television Society award was won for Technique, for Robin Lobb and the BBC Special Effects team. In the mid-1980s the BBC made concerted efforts into making productions for international sale, and the success of The Box of Delights on PBS in the U.S. led to commissioning of further fantasy series, in particular The Chronicles of Narnia (1988–90). In 2015, Radio Times magazine reported that amongst its audience: > The Box of Delights made a big impression on those who saw it when it > originally aired more than three decades ago on BBC1. Mainly because it > somehow managed to be the image of snowy Edwardian chocolate-box perfection, > and pretty bloody creepy at the same time...The incidental music and special > effects — while nostalgic for those who revere, say, Peter Davison-era > Doctor Who — do seem dated to 21st-century kids dazzled by CGI. But the > whole thing is carried off with such innovative spirit and charm that it > really doesn't matter.\\" The children's author Piers Torday noted that the series was his first experience of \\"appointment to view\\" television, stating \\"The early special effects in the style of Doctor Who were as stardust to my young eyes...It wasn’t only the state-of-the-art animation and the compelling performances that captured my imagination, but also the magic of the story.\\" Simon Brew, reviewing the series for Den of Geek! in 2011 was of the opinion that although dated in some respects, the festive atmosphere and story contribute to its continued appeal: > Inevitably, under greater scrutiny, it’s not hard to see the Sellotape > holding it all together in places. There’s also a lull in the middle of the > story that’s hard to ignore, and cliffhangers that are barely worthy of the > name. But there’s also a strong drama, with surprisingly broad appeal here. > It benefits from such a large cast...the ambition of the production, and the > weaving in of practical effects, animation, and some computer work, is quite > excellent...Most of all, though, it just works. It has a strange quality, in > that it just feels so right, that it doesn't require being picked at and > pulled apart. It is what it is, and in this case, that means it remains one > of the most magical Yuletide dramas that the BBC has ever made.\\" ==Soundtrack release== An extract featuring the \\"First Nowell\\" title segment was released as a single by BBC Records.

His songs are exclusively written in English. == Biography == Born in France to Algerian parents, Rilès started making music at a very early age by learning guitar and making Youtube covers. After obtaining a bachelor's degree, he decided to focus solely on music as a career. Rilès studied English literature at the University of Rouen while studying music on his own in his free time. He worked as a supervisor for a while to save up enough money and build his own home-studio in his bedroom. He then began to compose and write music independently. Rilès is also talented in arts. He sells his pieces of art as a way to make extra money for his music career. Rilès started his own music career by writing, producing, and mastering his own songs, as well as recording, directing and editing his music videos. This is reflected in his song lyrics where he references recording and producing his music independently. He released his first album, Vanity Plus Mind (2015) and released a variety of singles such as “Brothers” which became a staple and one of his biggest hits in 2016. That same year he released one song per week, every Sunday, for a year to compile into his second “album” (more a collection of songs than an album) called “RILÈSUNDAYZ” which is made up of 52 songs. This includes songs “I Do it”, “Pesetas” and “Should I”, as some of the most popular songs. He organised in a concert tour in France in 2017 during which he performed at the Bataclan in Paris, twice, then at the Zenith of Rouen. ==Discography== EPs *2015: Vanity Plus Mind Studio albums *2019: Welcome to the jungle Singles {  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:10px;\\"Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:150px;\\"Title ! style=\\"text-align:center; width:20px;\\"Peak positions ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:70px;\\"Album - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"  FR -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" rowspan=72017  \\"Brothers\\"  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"31  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  \\"I Do It\\"  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"48  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  \\"Thank God\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"54  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Welcome to the jungle -  \\"In the Jungle\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"121  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" -  \\"Should I\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"147  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  \\"Away\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"171  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  \\"Another Complaint, But..\\"  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"185  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" rowspan=22018  \\"Pesetas\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"179  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  \\"!I'll Be Back!\\"  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"103  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"2019  \\"Marijuana\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"?  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Welcome to the jungle -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"2019  \\"Against the clock\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"?  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Welcome to the jungle -  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"2019  \\"Myself n the sea\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"?  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"Welcome to the jungle } == References == Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:People from Rouen Category:French male singers Category:French rappers Category:French songwriters Category:French people of Algerian descent ","title":"Rilès"},{"id":"56048782","text":"The 1990 GP Ouest-France was the 54th edition of the GP Ouest-France cycle race and was held on 21 August 1990.

It was released on 12 December 2017 as the lead single from Allen's fourth studio album, No Shame. It is her first official release since her third studio album, Sheezus, and the first official single released by Allen since \\"As Long as I Got You\\". The song was teased and leaked a night prior to its official release. ==Background== In 2015, Allen began writing songs for No Shame in a rented house in Los Angeles. Allen then set up her own studio space in London, where the majority of the album was made. Upon returning to London and setting up her studio space, Allen began associating with British Grime artist Giggs. Allen stated that her friendship with Giggs helped her \\"find her feet\\" during the album's initial recording process. After Allen's performance at V Festival, she traveled to Giggs' studio where she played him songs from No Shame, whilst Allen was there Giggs wrote a verse for the song \\"Trigger Bang\\". ==Composition== \\"Trigger Bang\\" is a piano-tinged hip pop song that has a length of three minutes and 32 seconds. It is in the key of A flat minor, and moves at a tempo of 78 beats per minute in a 4/4 time signature. The song contains a chilled-out sound and toned-down percussion instrumental. It lyrically reminisces about growing up and battling substance abuse. ==Critical reception== Robin Murray of Clash praised the song, writing that \\"the pairing [of Allen and Giggs] works effortlessly – Lily Allen's nonchalance versus the rapper's emphatic flow.\\" She additionally called it \\"typically tongue in cheek but with whipsmart wordplay\\". ==Music video== An accompanying music video for \\"Trigger Bang\\" directed by Myles Whittingham was released on 24 January 2018.

Harter (1857–1931) was an American politician and real estate investor who served as Mayor of Tillamook, Oregon for two terms, from 1911 to 1913. He resigned his office in July 1913 before information was released in an Oregon Circuit Court case alleging Harter took a payoff to ensure a public works contract. ==Biography== Born in Indiana in May 1857, Harter was first employed as a farm hand. Following his move to Tillamook County, Oregon, Harter found work as a lumberman. Harter became a real estate investor and developer in Tillamook County. In 1900, Harter was nominated by the Democratic Party for the position of Tillamook County Assessor. During the Tillamook caucus on November 25, 1911 Harter was nominated as a candidate for mayor. R. W. Watson was chosen as his opponent. The Oregonian asked Harter's opinion on the 1912 United States presidential election in Tillamook County to which he was quoted as saying, \\"As a matter of fact, everyone appears to be too busy to devote time talking politics. It is a fact, though, that Tillamook County is largely Republican, and the voters are practically unanimous for the re-election of President [William Howard] Taft.\\" On May 21, 1912, Harter addressed a group of Portland businessmen who chartered a railcar for a trade excursion through Tillamook County. While not explicitly in favor of saloons, Harter was the de facto \\"wet\\" candidate during the 1912 Tillamook mayoral election since his opponent, Hosea T. Botts, took a hardline pro-temperance stance. It was the first election that the women's suffrage law in Oregon had take effect and as a result half of the ballots in the 1912 Tillamook elections were cast by women. During a city council meeting in January 1913, Harter praised a law that banned minor boys from smoking in Tillamook, but wanted stronger penalties to allow law enforcement to make arrests. He also suggested moving Tillamook's curfew law up an hour \\"thereby lessening the opportunities for crime and carousel, detrimental to the peace and dignity of Tillamook, and much to the annoyance of our police force.\\" Harter also proposed creating a special police force composed of H. T. Goyne, attorney; Rev. H. W. Kullman, pastor at the Methodist Episcopal Church; Bernice Dick; and Retta Phillips. Before the case went before the circuit court, Harter resigned as mayor stating that he had neglected his personal affairs. His full statement which he read at the city council meeting on June 21 was as follows, \\"To the Honorable Common Council of Tillamook, Oregon. I hereby tender my resignation as Mayor of Tillamook, Oregon, said resignation to take place on or before July 1, 1913. I have a living to make and as long as I have the affairs of the city on my hands, I can do nothing else. I have spent almost a year and a half looking after the business of the city, to the neglect of my private affairs, and I feel at this time that I am not asking too much of you to allow me to shift the burden, and judging the future by the past I think you will have little trouble in getting someone else to stand under. Thanking you one and all together with the various other city officers, for the many kind courtesies I have received at your hands, and wishing you Godspeed, I am very truly yours, John Harter, Mayor.\\" Harter dismissed the town marshall and street commissioner before resigning his office. Charles L. Clough was appointed by the council to fill the vacancy left by Harter. The Tillamook Herald said Harter's actions as mayor that came to light in a trial against a contractor for faulty sewer construction work showed \\"apparent disloyalty to the people of Tillamook\\". In the case, City of Tillamook v. Warren Construction Company, which was heard in the circuit court in 1913, Tillamook's engineer Richardson testified that an employee for Warren Construction Company told him that a payment of $3,500 () was made or being made to Harter to secure the project. Harter denounced the testimony as false and called for an \\"unbiased\\" report on the sewer contract, which the city council agreed to take up. According to the 1920 United States Census, Harter was living with his family in San Diego, California working as a farmer. ==References== Category:1857 births Category:1931 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Oregon Category:Oregon Democrats Category:Mayors of places in Oregon Category:People from Tillamook, Oregon ","title":"John R.

Sarpuria is a famous sweet of Krishnanagar. ==Origin== There is a difference of opinion on the history of Sarapuriya. Chaitanyadev used to eat three types of confectionery. One of them Sarpuri or Sarapuriya. It is mentioned in Chaitanya charitamrita written by Krishnadas Kaviraj almost 520 years ago. Advaita Acharya himself sent Sarapuriya to Chaitanyadev. Sarpuria is an integral part of delivering offered to Chaitanya Mahaparabhu. According to the hystorical evidence, Krishnagar and the nearby place were chiefly occupied by a lot of milkman family. Thus the sarpuria came as a West Bengal sweet. On the other hand, the creator of Sarpuria was the Chandra Das of Krishnanagar. Sarpuria's creator is the father of his father Surukumar Das. It is said that he used to make doors by closing the door at night and with sana, latex and sarp, Sarapuriya and his other discovery Sarvaja. The next morning, he used to ferry in the head. The younger Adhar Chandra learned how to cook sweets for his father. In 1902, the sweet shop was established at Nadiar Para, i.e. the present Ananta Hari Mitra Road.। The name of the shop is Adhar Chandra Das. In time it became an institution. But fear of stealing the recipe, he closed the door and made sweet at night. But when the recipe was published gradually, other mules were made to make Sarapuriya and Sarwaja. ==Geographical Indication status== Sarpuria will get the GI registration as the origin of the sweet.

Thomas described the species based on specimens held by the Turin Museum of Natural History that had been collected by \\"Dr. Borelli\\", likely Dr. Alfredo Borelli, who furnished many biological specimens during this time from Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. The holotype had been collected in Caiza, Bolivia, which is located in the Potosí Department of Southern Bolivia. Of the species name \\"laephotis\\", Thomas was not clear on its meaning, though he remarked that it \\"[had] a similar meaning\\" to the name histiotus, which means \\"sail ear\\" (from Ancient Greek \\"ἱστός\\" meaning \\"mast\\" + \\"οὖς\\" meaning \\"ear\\"). A hypothesis for the etymology of laephotis is that it comes from Greek \\"λαιός\\" meaning \\"awkward\\" and \\"φως\\" meaning \\"light,\\" possibly referring to an awkward flight in the daylight. The validity of Thomas's big-eared brown bat as a species has been disputed. In the past, it has been regarded as a subspecies of the big-eared brown bat, H. macrotis. More recently, it has been considered a subspecies of the small big-eared brown bat, H. montanus. At present, several sources consider it a valid species. ==Description== Individuals weight approximately . Its ears are very long relative to other members of its genus, at long. The ears are wide. Its fur is dark brown, with the tips of individual hairs lighter brown. Its ears and flight membranes are grayish in color. Its forearm is long. From head to tail, it is long. Its tail is ; its tragus is long. It can be differentiated from the similar small big- eared brown bat (Histiotus montanus) by its yellowish fur, pale ears, and longer forearm. ==Range and habitat== Its range includes Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina. In March 2006, it was documented in Brazil for the first time. A paper published in 2015 cited its first ever documentation in Chile. ==Conservation== As of 2019, it is evaluated as near-threatened by the IUCN. Despite its reasonably wide distribution, it is dependent on fragile forest habitat that is significantly declining in extent and quality. ==References== Category:Mammals described in 1916 Category:Bats of South America Category:Taxa named by Oldfield Thomas Category:Histiotus ","title":"Thomas's big-eared brown bat"},{"id":"56049156","text":"Clarence Hylan Beavers (June 12, 1921 - December 4, 2017) was an American United States Army sergeant and paratrooper who served with the first all black airborne unit, the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion, during World War II. He was part of the groundbreaking group of black paratroopers assigned to the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion also known as the \\"Triple Nickles\\" and later \\"Smoke Jumpers\\" at Fort Benning in Georgia. During the 1940s, army posts in the south were largely segregated. Beavers later told stories about how members of the unit were not allowed to use the post exchange or mess hall, a privilege even Italian and German prisoners of war being held there were allowed. The unit served stateside, mostly on the West Coast, protecting against Japanese fire balloons, which were described as the world’s first intercontinental-range airborne weapons — giant bomb-laden balloons launched from Japan and aimed at North America. Beavers died on December 4, 2017 at his home in Huntington, Long Island of a coronary related illness.

Established around 1887, it was the home of one of the nation's most successful manufacturers of gold leaf by the process of goldbeating. The complex, including both industrial and residential components, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. ==Description and history== The former M. Swift and Sons Company plant is located in Hartford's residential North End neighborhood, on a roughly triangular parcel bounded by Love Lane on the west, Garden Street on the east, and Westland Street to the south. The largest structure is the main factory building, a two-story agglomeration of brick and stone structures that are the result of multiple building expansions by the Swift Company. The property also includes two houses, built c. 1887 and 1914, that are historically associated with the factory's owners. The company was founded in 1887, when Matthew Swift left Hartford's largest goldbeating company, the J.M. Ney Company, to begin his own business on this parcel, which he had purchased for his residence in 1871. Originally working out of a small wood-frame building south of his house, Swift's company grew rapidly, with repeated expansions of infrastructure by the early 19th century. In 1902, the Swift Company was the largest goldbeating company in the state. In the first half of the 20th century it continued to grow, shipping gold leaf to international markets, and innovating in the processes of its manufacture. The company's business eventually succumbed to changing tastes, and it was shuttered in 2005. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford, Connecticut ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford, Connecticut Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1887 ","title":"M.

Among other key assets, the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney included the 20th Century Fox film and television studios, U.S. cable/satellite channels such as FX, Fox Networks Group, a 73% stake in National Geographic Partners, Indian television broadcaster Star India, and a 30% stake in Hulu. Immediately preceding the acquisition, 21st Century Fox spun off the Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox Television Stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business, FS1, FS2, Fox Deportes, and the Big Ten Network into the newly-formed Fox Corporation. ==History== Early information (November 2017–April 2018) On November 6, 2017, CNBC reported The Walt Disney Company was negotiating a deal with Rupert Murdoch to acquire 21st Century Fox's filmed entertainment, cable entertainment, and direct broadcast satellite divisions, including 20th Century Fox, FX Networks, and National Geographic Partners. The deal would reportedly exclude the Fox Broadcasting Company, 20th Century Fox's studio lot, Fox Television Stations, Fox News Group, and Fox Sports, which would be spun off into a new independent company run by the Murdoch family. According to Disney's CEO Bob Iger, the idea of purchasing Fox's assets came after Disney acquired majority control of the streaming company BAMTech with anticipation to develop its own streaming service (which would eventually be called Disney+, launched in November 2019). Disney was less interested in Fox's production capacities and more keen to acquire Fox's own film and television libraries to help expand the streaming service's library. The deal would also include film rights to certain franchises owned by Fox, such as X-Men and Fantastic Four, the distribution rights to Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope (which were not owned by Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm respectively when Disney acquired the two companies). Talks had stalled for the day without a deal being finalized, but it was reported on November 10 that the prospected deal had yet to be fully abandoned. On November 16, it was reported that Comcast (parent company of NBCUniversal), Verizon Communications, and Sony (parent company of Columbia Pictures) had also joined Disney in a bidding war for 21st Century Fox. During a recent shareholders meeting, 21st Century Fox Co-Chairman Lachlan Murdoch said Fox was not in the category of \\"sub-scale\\" companies that were \\"finding it difficult to leverage their positions in new and emerging video platforms\\", but was instead a company that had \\"the required scale to continue to both execute on our aggressive growth strategy and deliver significant increased returns to shareholders\\". Because Disney owns the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), Comcast owns the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), and 21st Century Fox owned the Fox Broadcasting Company, a full acquisition of Fox by Disney or Comcast would have been illegal under the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s rules prohibiting a merger between any of two of the four major broadcast networks. On November 28, while mentioning a rumor that the rumored negotiations between Disney and Fox were progressing at a rapid pace, Mike Fleming Jr. of Deadline Hollywood commented, \\"given how Disney made the Marvel and Lucasfilm deals under the cone of silence, if this happens we'll probably only know it when it's announced. It is certainly being talked about today.\\" Rumors of a nearing deal continued on December 5, with additional reports suggesting the FSN regional sports networks would be included in the sale (assets that would likely be aligned with Disney's ESPN division). On December 11, Comcast announced it was dropping its bid on the Fox assets. On December 14, Disney and Fox confirmed a $52.4 billion deal to merge the two companies, pending approval from the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division. In February, CNBC reported that, despite the Disney–Fox deal, Comcast might take action to outbid Disney's $52.4 billion offer, if the AT&T;–Time Warner merger went through. Despite this, Fox President Peter Rice stated he was content with the Disney offer and that the Fox assets were \\"a great fit for Disney.\\" Early in March, the non-profit group Protect Democracy Project Inc. filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) on the hopes to seek any records of communications between the two groups over Disney's pending acquisition of Fox. The lawsuit also sought \\"any related antitrust enforcement efforts by the DOJ, to find out whether the president or his administration is improperly interfering with the independence of the DOJ out of favoritism for a political ally.\\" Donald Trump congratulated Murdoch for the Disney–Fox deal while attacking AT&T;'s acquisition of Time Warner, particularly over the ownership of CNN, which he frequently criticized due to alleged bias. On April 12, 2018, Rice revealed the acquisition was expected to close by summer 2019. Beginning in March 2018, a strategic reorganization of the Disney conglomerate saw the creation of two business segments, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products and Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International. Parks & Consumer Products was primarily a merger of Parks & Resorts and Consumer Products & Interactive Media, while Direct-to-Consumer & International took over for Disney International and global sales, distribution, and streaming units from Disney–ABC Television Group, Studio Entertainment, and Disney Digital Network. Given that Iger described it as \\"strategically positioning our businesses for the future\\", The New York Times considered the reorganization done in expectation of the 21st Century Fox purchase. Bidding war between Disney and Comcast (May–July 2018) On May 7, 2018, it was reported that Comcast spoke to investment banks about topping Disney's offer to acquire Fox. Shortly afterwards, Bob Iger stated he was willing to drop Sky plc from the deal to ensure the Fox acquisition. Several Fox investors said they would be open to terminate the company's agreement with Disney if Comcast followed through on its plan to launch a rival all-cash bid for $60 billion. Murdoch's family trust controlled 39% of Fox due to shares it held with special voting rights. However, under the company's by-law, those special rights did not apply to a vote on the Disney/Fox deal when the Murdoch trust only controlled 17% of the vote, making it easier for other shareholders to defeat him, which was expected as early as next month. Later that month, it was confirmed that Lachlan Murdoch, rather than James Murdoch, would take charge of the New Fox company. The following week, Comcast publicly announced it was looking into making an all-cash counter-offer for the Fox assets that Disney proposed to acquire. Shortly after, it was reported that Disney was looking into making its own all-cash counter-offer for Fox assets if Comcast went through with their offer. The next day, Disney and Fox announced they had set their shareholder vote meetings for July 10, although both said Fox's meeting could be postponed if Comcast came through with their offer. On June 12, AT&T; was given approval by District Judge Richard J. Leon to acquire Time Warner, easing concerns Comcast had regarding whether government regulators would block their bid for Fox. Consequently, the next day, Comcast mounted a bid of $65 billion for the 21st Century Fox assets that were set to be acquired by Disney. On June 18, it was reported that Disney will add to its already existing $52 billion claim to contest Comcast's proposed counter-offer for the Fox assets. On June 20, Disney and Fox announced they had amended their previous merger agreement, upping Disney's offer to $71.3 billion (a 10% premium over Comcast's $65 billion offer), while also offering shareholders the option of receiving cash instead of stock. On June 21, Murdoch said in response to Disney's higher offer: \\"We are extremely proud of the businesses we have built at 21st Century Fox, and firmly believe that this combination with Disney will unlock even more value for shareholders as the new Disney continues to set the pace at a dynamic time for our industry.\\" That still does not prevent other companies from making a bid, as the deal was needed to be voted on by shareholders. Iger explained the reasoning behind the bid: \\"Direct-to-consumer distribution has actually become an even more compelling proposition in the six months since we announced the deal. There has just been not only a tremendous amount of development in that space, but clearly the consumer is voting—loudly.\\" On June 27, the United States Department of Justice gave antitrust approval to Disney under the condition of selling Fox's 22 regional sports channels within 90 days of closing, to which the company has agreed. The next day, Disney and Fox boards scheduled July 27, 2018 as the day shareholders vote on Fox's properties being sold to Disney. On July 9, a Fox shareholder filed a lawsuit to stop the acquisition from Disney citing the absence of financial projections for Hulu. On the same day, CNBC reported Comcast was looking for companies that could take over Fox's Regional Sports Networks. The shareholder claimed that would've made Comcast's antitrust problems regarding the takeover of Fox assets easier as Comcast was preparing to make a new all cash counter-offer before July 27, 2018. On July 12, the Department of Justice filed a notice of appeal with the D.C. Circuit to reverse the District Court's approval for AT&T; acquisition of Time Warner (now WarnerMedia). Analysts said the chances of the DOJ win are small, but would be the \\"final nail in the coffin for Comcast's Fox chase. This is a clear gift to Disney.\\" On the next day, CEO of AT&T; Randall L. Stephenson gave an interview with CNBC, about Comcast's bid for Fox: \\"It probably can't help it. You're in a situation where two entities are bidding for an asset, and this kind of action can obviously influence the outcome of those actions.\\" On July 13, Disney received the support of the Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, the two most prominent proxy adviser firms in the world. Fox shareholders were recommended by the advisers as means to provide for Disney's future. On July 16, CNBC reported Comcast was unlikely to continue its bidding war with Disney to acquire Fox. Instead, Comcast is likely to continue pursuing 61% stake of Sky. On July 19, Comcast officially announced it was dropping its bid on the Fox assets in order to focus on its bid for Sky. The CEO of Comcast, Brian L. Roberts, said \\"I'd like to congratulate Bob Iger and the team at Disney and commend the Murdoch family and Fox for creating such a desirable and respected company.\\" Road to completion (July 2018–March 2019) On July 25, 2018, TCI Fund Management, the second largest shareholder of 21st Century Fox, indicated it voted to approve the Disney–Fox deal. On July 27, Disney and Fox shareholders approved the merger between the two companies. There were reports on August 9 that Viacom CEO Bob Bakish wants to license its TV ad targeting tech to the entire industry, starting with Fox. On August 12, the Competition Commission of India approved the Disney–Fox deal. On September 17, the European Commission scheduled a merger review for October 19, which was later postponed to November 6. On October 5, Disney announced the commencement of exchange offers and consent solicitations for 21st Century Fox. On October 10, it was reported that the new, post-merger organizational structure of \\"New Fox\\" would be implemented by January 1, 2019, ahead of the closure of the Disney sale (which is still expected to occur during the first half of 2019). On October 15, Disney offered a list of concessions to the European Commission, which extended the review deadline to November 6. The European Commission on November 6, 2018 cleared the sale, pursuant to the divestment of certain factual television networks in Europe owned by the Disney/Hearst joint venture A&E; Networks, including Blaze, Crime & Investigation, History, H2, and Lifetime. Disney will continue to be a 50 percent owner of A&E; everywhere outside of the European Economic Area. On November 19, China's regulators approved the Disney–Fox deal, without any conditions. After obtaining approval from Chinese regulators, Disney said it still needed to obtain regulatory approval from several other regulators, though the approvals from the United States, European Union, and China were considered the most important hurdles to clear. On December 3, Brazil's Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) said the deal would concentrate the market of cable sports channels. CADE recommended remedial measures. By December 14, the merger was subjected to regulation in Mexico, where Disney/Fox would account for 27.8% of content distribution across all genres. Disney would own 73% of all sports channels in Mexico. On January 31, Mexico's Federal Commission of Economic Competition (COFECE) approved the Disney–Fox deal after Disney agreed to sell its stake in Walt Disney Studios Sony Pictures Releasing de México, a Mexican film distributor, to Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group. On January 7, 2019, the registration statement for \\"New Fox\\", under the name Fox Corporation, was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. On January 11, it was reported that the deal is expected to close by either February or March 2019. However, on January 30, in a SEC filing by Disney, it was reported that the deal is expected to close by June 2019. Bob Iger met with Brazil's antitrust regulator CADE on February 12, 2019 to discuss the Disney–Fox deal. However, a decision on the deal still could not be reached. However, on February 20, Bloomberg said CADE will make its ruling on the Disney–Fox deal on February 27, 2019. On February 21, Bloomberg reported Disney will divest Fox Sports in Brazil and Mexico to get approval in these countries. The two countries are among the last major hurdles for the Disney–Fox deal. On February 27, Brazil's antitrust agency CADE approved the merger with conditions requiring Disney to divest Fox Sports Brazil among other measures. The regulator said it coordinated with regulators in Mexico and Chile in evaluating the transaction. Brazil's approval clears one of the final hurdles, allowing the deal to be completed in March. On March 4, The Walt Disney Company tweaked Robert Iger's compensation package he would receive upon closing the Disney–Fox deal, removing $13.5 million in potential salary and incentive awards available for the chief executive after the company closes its acquisition of 21st Century Fox Inc. assets. Mexico's telecom regulator, Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), approved the deal on March 11, 2019 under the condition that Disney and Fox agree to sell Fox Sports in the country within six months. They also had to keep the National Geographic brand separate from its A&E; channels. This cleared the last major holdout on the deal. On March 12, 2019 Disney announced it was set to close the Fox deal on March 20. Fox Corporation officially became a standalone, publicly traded company, separate from 21st Century Fox, on March 19, 2019 making Fox Corporation the owner of the assets that were not acquired by Disney. The announcement also included appointment of the board of directors. Also on March 19, 21st Century Fox officially completed distribution of new Fox shares ahead of the completion of the Disney deal. The deal was officially completed on March 20, 2019. At acquisition (October 2018–March 2019) Disney announced on October 8, 2018, 21st Century Fox's top television executives would join the company, including Peter Rice, Gary Knell, John Landgraf, and Dana Walden. Rice will serve as Chairman of Walt Disney Television and Co-Chair of Disney Media Networks, succeeding Ben Sherwood while Walden is to be named Chairman of Disney Television Studios and ABC Entertainment. Disney announced on March 5, 2019 Craig Hunegs would lead the combined TV operations at Disney Television Studios once the Disney–Fox deal closes. Hunegs will be president of the subsidiary, with oversight of all operations, including ABC Studios, ABC Signature, 20th Century Fox Television and Fox 21 TV studios. He'll report to Dana Walden, chairman of Fox Television Group who will be chairman of Disney Television Studios and ABC Entertainment. On October 18, 2018, Disney announced a new organizational structure for the Walt Disney Studios and the individual unit heads who would join the company except for Fox's filmed entertainment CEO Stacey Snider, including Emma Watts, Fox 2000 President of Production Elizabeth Gabler, Fox Searchlight Pictures Chairmen Nancy Utley and Stephen Gilula. Watts who currently serves as Vice Chairman and President of production at 20th Century Fox will continue in that post. All Fox film production units would report to Walt Disney Studios Chairman Alan Horn except for Fox Family and 20th Century Fox Animation reporting to Watts and Horn. By March 22, 2019, Fox Family only reports to Watts while Fox Animation reporting only to Horn. On December 13, 2018, Disney announced a new organizational structure for its international operations and the individuals who would join the company, including Jan Koeoppen and Uday Shankar. Shankar who currently serves as Chairman and President Fox Networks Group Asia and Star India will lead Disney's Asian operations and will become the new Chairman of Disney India. Post-acquisition (March 2019–present) It was reported on March 21, 2019 that Disney would shut down the Fox 2000 Pictures studio in 2020, following the release of The Woman in the Window. On the same day it was reported that up to 4,000 people would lose their jobs as Disney commenced layoffs following the merger. The top executives given two to six months notice of being laid off include 20th Century Fox film president of domestic distribution Chris Aronson, president of worldwide marketing Pamela Levine, co-president of marketing Kevin Campbell, chief content officer Tony Sella, international distribution president Andrew Cripps, executive vice president of corporate communications Dan Berger, executive vice president of legal affairs and executive vice president of Fox Stage productions Bob Cohen and executive vice president of publicity Heather Phillips, 20th Television president Greg Meidel and Fox Consumer Products boss Jim Fielding. The layoffs from Fox's Film Division continued from March, May, June, July and more recently in August 2019. As of July 31, 2019, the layoff totaled 250 with the lay off of several dozen employees in the production and visual effects departments with key Fox executives in this group were executive VP of feature production Fred Baron, executive VP of physical production Dana Belcastro, executive VP of post-production Fred Chandler and visual effects John Kilkenny. Debmar-Mercury announced on April 3 that it would end its national ad sales partnership with 20th Television, and that they will transfer their national ad sales for their first-run and off-network shows by the company to CBS Television Distribution Media Sales. Disney's ESPN unit acquired on April 10 a package of rights to the Big 12 Conference in college athletics that had previously been held by Fox. On April 15, 2019, Hulu acquired AT&T;'s 9.5% stake in Hulu for $1.43 billion, with Disney and NBCUniversal co-owning the share. Disney announced on April 24, 2019 that it had canceled a number of upcoming Fox films such as Mouse Guard, News of the World (whose rights were then picked up by Universal Pictures), and an adaptation of Angie Thomas' On the Come Up (whose rights were then moved to Paramount Players), and that some projects, such as The King's Man, Fear Street, and Steven Spielberg's remake of West Side Story, were still in production. On May 7, Disney announced a revised release schedule for several Disney and Fox films. Among the changes, several films (Artemis Fowl, Ad Astra, Spies in Disguise, The New Mutants, and Call of the Wild), were moved to later release dates. All the Fox Marvel films previously scheduled for release after 2019 were removed from the schedule. Avatar 2 was rescheduled from 2020 to a 2021 Christmas release, after which Avatar sequels will be released every other Christmas holiday release, alternating with Star Wars sequels through 2027. On April 25, 2019, Shannon Ryan, who was previously Fox Television chief marketing officer, was made president of marketing for ABC Entertainment and Disney Television Studios, she will report directly to Karey Burke, president of ABC Entertainment, and Craig Hunegs, president of Disney Television Studios. Sinclair Broadcast Group agreed on April 26, 2019 to acquire Fox Sports Networks (excluding YES Network, being sold separately to Yankee Global Enterprises) from Disney for $10 billion. On May 14, 2019, Disney announced it had assumed control of Hulu as part of a put/call agreement with Comcast and its 33% stake in the service. Comcast will continue to license NBCUniversal content and live carriage of NBCUniversal channels until late 2024 and their stake in Hulu could be sold to Disney as early as January of that year. In addition, both companies will fund Hulu's purchase of AT&T;'s 9.5% stake in Hulu. Following the acquisition, Disney reorganized its television division to align various operations. On June 10, 2019, Disney announced that both Disney Television Studios and FX Entertainment would share the same casting division. On July 31, 2019, Disney reorganized Hulu's reporting structure, placing Hulu's Scripted Originals team under Walt Disney Television. Under the new structure, Hulu's SVP of Original Scripted Content would report directly to the chairman of Disney Television Studios and ABC Entertainment. Fox Stage Productions on July 3, 2019 was moved into Disney Theatrical Group as Buena Vista Theatrical division with all top executives leaving at that time. On August 1, 2019, Disney announced that the Fox Research Library will be folded into the Walt Disney Archives and Disney Imagineering Archives by January 2020. On August 7, 2019, Disney announced that they would overhaul Fox film projects in development except Avatar, Planet of the Apes and Kingsman sequels due to Dark Phoenix causing a third- quarter loss. A new reduced slate of about 10 films per year fully overseen by Disney will now be the main focus, with 20th Century Fox making half of the movies for Hulu and Disney+. Fox properties such as Home Alone, Night at the Museum, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid have been assigned for Disney+ release and assigned to Fox Family. On August 9, 2019, the Los Angeles Times reported that Disney would be pulling all Fox film library titles out of all theater chains and moving them onto either Hulu or Disney+. Little Theatre, a local theater chain in Rochester, New York, was forced to cancel their August 5 screening of Fight Club after Disney notified the theater that it was not allowed to screen the film in the future. On August 22, 2019, Sinclair completed its acquisition of Fox Sports Networks from Disney. Seven days later, the Yankees/Sinclair/Amazon consortium also completed the acquisition of the 80% share of YES Network from Disney on August 29, 2019 with the Yankees owning 65%, Sinclair owning 20% and Amazon owning the remaining 15%. On September 10, 2019, Disney announced their plans to sell the video game division of FoxNext, preferring to license its properties for video games rather than develop them. On October 22, 2019, the Banijay Group announced its intent to acquire Endemol Shine Group from Disney and Apollo Global Management for $2.2 billion. Disney and Apollo agreed to sell Endemol to Banijay on October 26, 2019, pending antitrust approval from regulators. On July 3, 2020, Banijay completed its purchase of Endemol Shine. On October 24, Vulture reported that Disney was limiting theatrical exhibitions of Fox's older films, with several theaters and film programmers reporting that Fox's back catalogue was no longer available to them. In January 2020, Disney began to rebrand Fox's studios to remove references to \\"Fox\\" from their names, with 20th Century Fox being renamed \\"20th Century Studios\\", and Fox Searchlight Pictures being renamed \\"Searchlight Pictures\\". On January 22, 2020, Disney announced it had sold off a majority of FoxNext's assets, including FoxNext Games Los Angeles, Cold Iron Studios, Aftershock development studios and FoxNext's original IP's, to mobile game developer Scopely. On January 24, 2020, Disney announced they would shutter Fogbank Entertainment. On January 31, 2020, Disney eliminated the role of Hulu CEO, as part of fully integrating Hulu with Disney's business model. Under the new structure, top Hulu executives would report directly to DTCI and Walt Disney Television leads. On March 17, 2020 The Wall Street Journal reported that Disney is looking to sell TrueX due to lack of investment after being label a noncore asset. On May 6, 2020 Brazil's antitrust agency CADE approved the merger between Fox Sports Brazil and ESPN Brasil. with conditions requiring Disney to keep Fox Sports Brazil until January 1, 2022, when the channel's operations are expected to be absorbed into ESPN. In the meantime, ESPN and Fox Sports will share the rights to broadcasting sporting events. On August 10, 2020, Disney announced a reorganization and rebranding of its television studios, with 20th Century Fox Television being subsumed by 20th Television, and Fox 21 Television Studios being rebranded as Touchstone Television (reviving a name dropped in 2007 by what then became ABC Studios — which itself was renamed ABC Signature). On September 28, 2020, Disney announced that it had sold TrueX to Gimbal, Inc. ==Criticisms and concerns== Despite Disney passing antitrust approval from regulators in every country, critics of Disney's purchase expressed a significant amount of antitrust concerns. The deal is a horizontal merger (i.e., in which a company buys up a corporation that produces the same goods and products) as opposed to a vertical merger (i.e., two companies that operate at separate stages of the production process for a specific finished product), much akin to the integrations of AT&T;–Time Warner and Comcast–NBC Universal. Horizontal mergers are more disapproved than vertical mergers, as they affect a more tangible reduction in competition. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) states on its website that \\"The greatest antitrust concern arises with proposed mergers between direct competitors (horizontal mergers).\\" As both Disney and Fox produce films and television series, the deal reduced the number of major film studios in Hollywood from six to five. Some argued the operation would still leave many competitors around since Disney may compete with Netflix in the online streaming market with Disney+ and Hulu in equal conditions with its newly acquired properties. Opponents countered that these arguments do not hold much weight due to Disney's powerful box office and stock market shares, its practices, and its purchase of Fox's many assets. News media A film reporter said, \\"They'll have more control over more things, so if they decide they don't like what you wrote and want to ban you from their screenings, eventually that will mean all of entertainment. For journalists and reporters trying to do their job, it is frightening to see the scope of one company expand in that way and know that your fate is kind of tied up with them.\\" \\"We've seen a pattern in Disney's behavior. The more power they have, the more they wield it,\\" one entertainment reporter said. A freelance critic and member of the New York Film Critics Circle said that they were troubled by the idea of the Disney–Fox deal. On November 3, 2017, Disney banned the Los Angeles Times from attending press screenings of its films in retaliation for the paper's coverage of their political influence in Anaheim, California in September of that year. On November 7, however, Disney reversed its decision, after receiving massive protests and condemnation from a number of major publications and writers including The New York Times, The Boston Globe critic Ty Burr, The Washington Post blogger Alyssa Rosenberg, A Wrinkle in Time director Ava DuVernay, the websites The A.V. Club and Flavorwire, and film critic organizations which threatened to disqualify Disney films from their year-end awards in retaliation, specifically, the National Society of Film Critics, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, New York Film Critics Circle, and Boston Society of Film Critics. Jason Bailey, the editor of Flavorwire, thought the way Disney treated the Los Angeles Times was \\"absolutely chilling\\", fearing it would only grow more common after the merger: One film writer stated that \\"I personally worry that a studio this big will need the press less and less. I don't think anything drastic will change immediately, but I think it is more important than ever for entertainment reporters to uphold journalistic values. We are not their PR arms, no matter how much they'd like us to be.\\" Another film reporter said, \\"As a critic, I've had Disney tell me they don't want to invite me to [its] film because I didn't like the last one. It really scares me to watch them get even more power.\\" Theaters Unlike other studios, Disney has a reputation for strict conditions being forced upon theater owners for its films, such as Avengers: Age of Ultron and Star Wars: The Last Jedi. For the latter, Disney demanded a 65% cut of domestic ticket sales (rather than the minimum 55% to 60% cut) along with a four-week hold in each venue, and a 5% penalty to any theater owner who breaks any part of the contract, including taking the film off- screen. If the Disney–Fox deal had happened in late 2016, Disney's domestic box office in 2017 would have equaled $4.5 billion or 40% market share, a figure no major studio has ever hit. For some, the deal would give Disney unprecedented market power in the industry. One distribution studio executive denounced the deal, saying that \\"If I was an independent mom-and-pop theater, I would just close down; there's no way to survive. With a 40% market share, how do you negotiate against that?\\" John Roper, the general manager of the Phoenix Theatre in Fort Nelson, British Columbia, said that Disney/Fox had him worried about even stricter rules in the future, stating, \\"It's not good for any type of industry when a company grows that large. Disney holds all the cards, and we have to play by their rules. Smaller cinemas are just left in the dust.\\" Roper decided not to screen Star Wars: The Last Jedi because of Disney's strict conditions of requiring the theater to run the film four weeks straight and play it four times a day (as opposed to other studios, who only require a minimum of two weeks for a film run and play it one time a day). Elkader Cinema in Elkader, Iowa, opted out the movie for the same reason, with owner Lee Akin stating that \\"I can't get the entire town in my auditorium in one week's time let alone four.\\" In Brazil, Disney demanded a 52% cut of Cocos domestic ticket sales (rather than the historical 50% cut) and some theaters (with exceptions including foreign chains, such as Cinemark Theatres and Cinépolis) boycotted the film. Coco was shown in 618 screens, against 919 screens that showed Sony Pictures' Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. On November 22, 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice formally filed its motion for a federal court order to nullify the Paramount Decrees, which was set in place after the 1948 case United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. that required movie studios to divest themselves of their theatrical arms, and prohibited certain anti-competitive practices in the distribution business. The Department had cited the shifting realities of an industry that has come to rely on online revenue such as streaming services as a justification. David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that such move would be very disruptive to the theater industry: The National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO), which represents major theater chains, expressed its concern about the murky future the DOJ could create, saying \\"If exhibitors were forced to book out the vast majority of their screens on major studio films for most of the year, this would leave little to no room for important films from smaller studios.\\" Pay television industry American Cable Association President and CEO Matthew M. Polka lambasted the deal and called on federal regulators to \\"fully investigate\\" the merger. He was concerned about his smaller subscription television constituents having to negotiate multichannel deals with a behemoth that combines Fox's regional sports networks with ESPN and its cadre of collegiate-conference-focused RSNs, as well as the majority stake in Hulu: Many European telecommunication companies also expressed concerns about the Disney–Fox deal, considering that Sky plc and Sky UK were included in the package, as it serves almost 23 million households across Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria, and Italy. Disney's takeover of Sky would be greater than RTL Group, Mediaset, ITV, ProSiebenSat.1 Media, Viasat, and Vivendi combined, according to Eikon estimates, and could allow Sky to expand into new markets and bid more for sports rights and other content. Some felt that a Disney- owned Sky UK would be most damaging to its pay-TV competitors since it has invested in content to cross-sell television with mobile services, in a bid to squeeze more out of customers. A hedge fund with a small stake in Sky has complained that the Disney–Fox deal could cost minority shareholders in the UK satellite broadcaster a hefty premium unless UK regulators intervene. Dish Network CEO Erik Carlson said blockbuster mergers like the Disney–Fox deal could severely limit the number of content companies providing to their customers. Carlson said on CNBC's Squawk on the Street that \\"We really take the position that we think about the customer and the customer first.\\" Entertainment industry The Writers Guild of America West, the union that represents writers of films, television, and other media, wrote that: Tom Rothman, chairman of the Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group and former co-chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, said the Disney–Fox deal was a dangerous proposition: \\"Consolidation under giant corporate mandates rarely promotes creative risk-taking. And in the long run, it is always a challenge to compete against horizontal monopolistic power.\\" James Mangold, director of Fox's Marvel adaptations The Wolverine and its R-rated sequel Logan, expressed concerns that the deal might lead to the approval of a similar film that may have more limited appeal than a conventional Marvel blockbuster, thereby limiting the opportunities for certain filmmakers as well as the consumers. Mangold said that \\"If they're actually changing their mandate, if what they're supposed to do alters, that would be sad to me because it just means less movies.\\" At the Critics' Choice Movie Awards on January 11, 2018, producer J. Miles Dale, who accepted the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Picture for The Shape of Water, urged Disney \\"not to mess\\" with 20th Century Fox's indie studio Fox Searchlight Pictures, saying, \\"they're making the kind of movies that we need to make, we want to make, and people need to see.\\" Writer Marc Guggenheim, known for his work for the Arrowverse for The CW, said that \\"As a writer, I'm not a big fan of these big corporate consolidations. I don't think they're necessarily good for writers, directors, producers, and actors. I also, as an American, don't love these big corporate mergers. I don't think they're necessarily good for the country.\\" The potential acquisition of Fox by Disney caused concern within the entertainment industry that smaller media companies, including Viacom, CBS Corporation, Lionsgate, and Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer, would need to consolidate or be sold in order to remain competitive. On February 13, 2018, television producer Ryan Murphy, a long-time collaborator of 20th Century Fox Television, signed a five-year $300 million agreement with Netflix, a move considered to be a big blow to Fox and Disney. Murphy cited the Disney–Fox deal as the main reason for departure, arguing that his freedom under Disney might be severely limited in creating new, risk-taking content. Jeff Bock of Exhibitor Relations expressed hope that the merger would force creativity in other studios like Paramount, which might focus on smaller- budget films knowing that it could not compete with Walt Disney (after the Fox acquisition) in making big-budget blockbusters. Viacom CEO Bob Bakish has stated that the Disney–Fox deal provides a \\"very real opportunity\\" to hire new executive and creative talent at Paramount and other studios amid the \\"dislocation associated with change of ownership\\" at Disney and Fox. Bakish also suggested that Viacom and other companies can provide new content for streaming services such as Netflix once Disney removes their content from the service in 2019. Walt Disney Studios co-chairman and CEO Alan F. Horn acknowledged that Disney has a stranglehold on the entertainment industry especially after the Fox acquisition, but defended against the monopoly accusations: Tom Reimann of Collider said that \\"Horn's bizarre, rambling rationalization veers towards seemingly deliberate obfuscation at several points\\" by saying that he \\"point[ed] out that Disney makes a wide variety of films (the two topics are wholly unrelated) while admitting only that Disney enjoys 'a very hefty percentage of the box office' without acknowledging that the studio has bought out most of its meaningful competition.\\" Political reaction President Donald Trump praised both companies for the merger, believing it is best for American jobs. However, U.S. Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the House Antitrust Subcommittee, expressed concerns over the transaction. He said in a statement that \\"Disney's proposed purchase of 21st Century Fox threatens to put control of even more television, movie, and news content into the hands of a single media giant. If it's approved, this acquisition could allow Disney to limit what consumers can watch and increase their cable bills,\\" he said. \\"Disney will gain more than 300 channels, 22 regional sports networks, control over Hulu, and a significant portion of Roku.\\" Other comments Richard Greenfield, a BTIG Research analyst, wrote that the combined Disney and Fox assets would have a 39% theatrical market share: In response to the Disney–Fox deal, analyst Andy Hargreaves of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. downgraded Fox's stock from overweight to Sector Weight with no assigned price target. Hargreaves said that although the merger is positive for both companies, it comes with a high antitrust risk due to Disney's potential share of theatrical revenue, its share of domestic cable assets, its strong position in sports, and its power to already force preferential deals with cable, satellite, and theater owners. David Balto, an antitrust lawyer and former policy director at the FTC, said that the inclusion of regional sports networks would give Disney greater leverage with cable and satellite distributors: \\"Any increase in Disney sports programming will be extremely problematic and will get intense scrutiny\\". John Simpson of the activist group Consumer Watchdog said that the deal \\"would give far too much monopolistic power to Disney, which is known for cutthroat, hardball tactics\\", and \\"can only mean higher prices and less choice for consumers.\\" Barton Crockett, a media analyst at B. Riley FBR, said that \\"Disney is becoming the Wal-Mart of Hollywood: huge and dominant. That's going to have a big influence up and down the supply chain.\\" Ian Bezek, contributor to InvestorPlace, questioned the underlying rationale for the merger, asking why Disney needed to acquire Fox's film production and cable sports business for such a \\"high price\\", given Disney's already healthy positions in both businesses: Jonathan Barnett, law professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law states that when considering streaming services under the same markets as theaters, worries about Disney's control \\"would be substantially diminished\\". Matt Stoller, in his article for Pro-Market website, argued that: ==Assets== Acquired by Disney Disney acquired the majority of 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets. These include: * 20th Century Fox – on January 17, 2020 became 20th Century Studios ** Fox Family ** 20th Century Fox Animation – became 20th Century Animation *** Blue Sky Studios ** Fox 2000 Pictures – to be dissolved ** Fox Studios Australia ** Fox Stage Productions – on July 3, 2019 became Buena Vista Theatrical division within Disney Theatrical Group ** Fox Searchlight Pictures – on January 17, 2020 became Searchlight Pictures ** Boom!

It went on to become a battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment in the Territorial Force and saw action on the Western Front during World War I. Between the wars it converted into an air defence unit, serving during World War II first as a searchlight regiment defending West Yorkshire and later as a garrison battalion in North West Europe. Postwar it continued in the Territorial Army in the air defence role until 1955. ==Origin== During an invasion scare in 1859, large numbers of part-time Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) were formed throughout Great Britain, eager to supplement the Regular British Army in case of need.Beckett.Westlake.Magnus, pp. 15–6.Spiers, pp. 163–8. On 27 September 1859, two independent companies formed in Bradford, West Yorkshire, designated the 5th and 6th (Bradford) Yorkshire West Riding RVCs. The following February the two units merged with other unnumbered Bradford companies to form the 5th RVC, renumbered in April 1860 as the 3rd following other mergers. The new 3rd Yorkshire West Riding RVC comprised four companies, which rose to five in October when it absorbed the newly established 24th (Eccleshill) RVC.Becket, Appendix VII.Frederick, p. 178.Westlake, p. 259. The unit was large enough to function as an independent battalion, and the smaller 39th West Riding RVC (formed at Bingley in 1861, later at Saltaire), was attached to it until it was fully absorbed in the 1870s.Army Lists, various dates. In 1861 the unit built itself an armoury and drill hall at Manningham Lane, Bradford, which became known as Belle Vue Barracks.Bradford at Drill Hall Project.Look and Learn History Picture Library. Henry Sagar Hirst (1829–99), a member of a prominent family from nearby Clayton, was commissioned into the unit as an ensign when it formed, but after only three years he became its lieutenant-colonel commandant, a position he held from 1862 until 1890. He was awarded a CB for services to the Volunteer Movement.Prominent Claytonians at Clayton History Group, with picture of Hirst in uniform. ==Volunteer Battalion== Under the scheme of 'localisation' introduced by the Cardwell Reforms, Volunteer units were affiliated with their local Regular regiments, and the 3rd West Riding RVC was assigned to Sub-District No 10, Brigade No 10 (West Riding of Yorkshire) based at the depot of the 14th Foot (later the West Yorkshire Regiment) at Bradford.Spiers, pp. 195–6. On 1 July 1881 the 3rd West Riding RVC became a Volunteer Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment, and on 1 December 1887, now eight companies strong, it was formally redesignated the 2nd Volunteer Battalion, Prince of Wales's Own (West Yorkshire) Regiment. The regimental uniform, which had been scarlet with Rifle green facings, was changed to scarlet faced white in 1887 (scarlet faced buff from 1904) to match the parent regiment. While the regimental districts were referred to as 'brigades', they were purely administrative organisations and the Volunteers were excluded from the mobilisation system. The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 proposed a more comprehensive Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training. The volunteer battalions of the West Yorkshire Regiment and the Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding) were assigned to the West Yorkshire Brigade, which would assemble at Leeds in case of emergency.Beckett, pp. 135, 185–6.Dunlop, pp. 60–1. The 2nd Volunteer Battalion formed a cyclist company in 1900, and the same year provided an active service company of volunteers to fight alongside the Regulars in the Second Boer War. This gained the battalion its first Battle honour: South Africa 1900–02.Leslie. ==Territorial Force== When the Volunteer Force was subsumed into the Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane reforms in 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Magnus, Chapter 1.Spiers, Chapter 10. the 2nd Volunteer Battalion became the 6th Battalion, The Prince of Wales's Own (West Yorkshire Regiment) (6th West Yorkshires). The West Riding Brigade split, the four TF battalions of the West Yorkshires forming the 1st West Riding Brigade in the West Riding Division.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 85–91.West Yorkshires at Long, Long Trail.Barker, p. 53. On the outbreak of war in 1914, the 6th West Yorkshires were commanded by Lt-Col H.O. Wade.Magnus, p. 28. ==World War I== Mobilisation Towards the end of July 1914, the units of the West Riding Division left their headquarters for their annual training camps, but on 3 and 4 August they were ordered to return; on 4 August immediate mobilisation was ordered. On the evening of 5 August, 575 out of the total strength of 589 of the 6th Bn were present at Belle Vue Barracks, and 215 former members had re-enlisted. By 8 August the battalion was already up to its war establishment, including about 100 Class II National Reservists – old soldiers who would be invaluable for training the mass of recruits who were coming forward.Magnus, pp. 31–2.National Reserve at Long, Long Trail.James, pp. 57–8. Shortly afterwards, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service and the majority of the battalion did so. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix while the parent unit took '1/'. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.Barker, p. 54.Magnus, pp. 39, 71–2. 1/6th Battalion After mobilisation, the 1st West Riding Division concentrated in the South Yorkshire area, with the 1/6th Bn going to Selby on 10 August before moving to camp on Knavesmire Common, near York on 24 August. On 22 November half of the battalion was sent to Redcar to dig defences along the North Sea coast; it returned to York on 10 December, having handed over to the reserve companies furnished by the 2/6th Bn.Magnus, p. 32.49th Div at Long, Long Trail. At the end of February 1915 the battalion moved to billets in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, and at the end of the month the division was informed that it had been selected to proceed to France as a complete formation. On 15 April the battalion entrained for Folkestone, where it embarked and landed at Boulogne the same night to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). On 22 April the 1st West Riding Bde was attached to 7th Division for training in the routine of trench duties. On 28 April the West Riding Division took over its own section of the line at Fleurbaix. It now formed part of IV Corps, which attacked at the Battle of Aubers Ridge on 9 May. While the other two divisions of IV Corps made the actual attack, the West Riding Division took over the greater part of the corps' trench line. It was supposed to follow up and occupy the captured enemy line, but the breakthrough did not occur.Magnus, pp. 45–6, 50–. Corporal Samuel Meekosha, VC. On 12 May the division was designated 49th (West Riding) Division and the brigade became 146th (1st West Riding) Brigade.Magnus, p. 40. For the next nine months the 49th Division took part in no major operations but was almost continuously engaged in day-to-day trench warfare, much of it in the Ypres Salient, with the considerable casualties that this entailed. On 15 November 1915 the 1/6th West Yorkshires relieved the 1/8th Bn in trenches near the Yser Canal north east of Ypres. On 19 November one of the platoons was heavily shelled, with six killed and seven wounded out of its strength of 20 men. Corporal Samuel Meekosha took command, sent a runner for assistance, and dug out the wounded and buried men while under heavy shell fire. Meekosha was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), the first to be won in the division.Magnus, pp. 57–62.London Gazette, 22 January 1916. On 19 December the division received a sudden attack with the new German phosgene gas, followed by heavy shelling. The battalion lined the parapet, but no serious infantry attack followed.Edmonds, pp. 158–62.Magnus, p. 63. In January 1916 the division was withdrawn for its first period of complete rest since it first entered the line. Somme In February the division went back into the line in the Somme sector, and spent the next few months alternating trench duties with working parties and training for the forthcoming Somme Offensive. For this the 49th Division formed the reserve for X Corps, which was tasked with seizing the Thiepval Spur, after which the 49th was to pass through and continue the pursuit. The West Riding battalions moved up to assembly trenches in Aveluy Wood before dawn on the day of the attack (1 July), and by 09.00 the 1/6th West Yorks had crossed the River Ancre and was in Thiepval Wood. Ordered to move towards Thiepval village to support the 36th (Ulster) Division, the battalion came under fire the moment it left the shelter of the wood. Men were caught by machine gun fire passing through a gap in a hedge, and it was plainly impossible to cross No man's land. The attacking companies lost half their strength, including the CO, Lt-Col Wade, who was wounded. The 1/6th Bn was withdrawn and became brigade reserve while the rest of the brigade attempted to relieve the beleaguered Ulstermen.Edmonds, pp. 394–9, 411–4.Magnus, pp. 85–9, 93–6.Middlebrook, pp. 209–10, Appendix 3. German troops using a flamethrower in a trench. By 14 July the British had taken Leipzig Redoubt on the Thiepval Spur; 1/6th West Yorkshires relieved 1/7th (Leeds Rifles) Bn in the line that night. Early the following morning the Germans counter-attacked using flamethrowers. After the first surprise, the battalion manned the parapets and drove back most of the attackers. One German party got into a British sap, but were driven out by the battalion's bombers and the brigade's light mortar battery. The fight lasted about three hours.Magnus, pp. 96–7. William Orpen, A Trench, Thiepval – German wire. While the offensive continued, 49th Division remained holding the area round the Leipzig salient, with a number of small actions and suffering a good deal of shelling, while preparing trenches and dumps for a renewed attack in that sector. The attack was made on 3 September, at the end of the Battle of Pozières, and 1/6th Bn was in the first wave, which went over the top punctually at 05.10. Communication was poor, and after about four hours the remnants of the attacking companies were back on the start line. Although the first objectives had been reached, they could not be held, and many small parties were cut off and captured. A second attack was called off, and 146th Bde was withdrawn. 49th Division continued minor operations towards Thiepval during the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (15–22 September) before the offensive petered out.Magnus, pp. 100–7. Ypres The ruins of Poelcapelle before the battle. During the summer of 1917 the 49th Division was earmarked for operations along the Flanders coast that failed to materialise. In October it was moved to the Ypres sector to join the Third Ypres Offensive. It took part in the Battle of Poelcapelle on 9 October, with 1/6th West Yorkshires acting as the reserve battalion for 146th Bde in the centre of the attack. The troops had a long night approach march in rain across appalling ground under shellfire, and only just reached the jumping-off tapes in time for Zero. When the attack went in at 05.20, the rain stopped so that the German defenders had perfect visibility. 148th (3rd West Riding) Brigade was immediately stopped by a flooded stream, leaving 146th Bde to advance alone. They managed a few hundred yards before being stopped by a broad belt of undamaged German barbed wire. They were under fire from artillery, riflemen hidden in shell craters, and from machine guns in German pillboxes on the higher ground ahead. Although some of these pillboxes were taken, the division's attacking troops were back at their start line by the afternoon, having suffered heavy casualties.Liddle, pp. 221, 281–2.Magnus, pp. 138–41.Wolff, pp. 223, 226–8, 233–5. Spring Offensive Once 2/6th Bn West Yorkshires was disbanded at the end of January 1918 (see below), the 1/6th became simply '6th Bn' once more. 49th Division remained in the Ypres area during the winter of 1917–18 and was therefore not involved in the first stage of the German Spring Offensive. However, when the second phase (Operation Georgette, or the Battle of the Lys) began on 9 April, it soon began to put pressure on the southern part of the Ypres Salient. Brigade groups from 49th Division were sent south to support other British formations. On 11 April it was the turn of 146th Bde, which moved to the slopes of Mont Kemmel, eventually coming under the command of the 28th French Division. In the early hours of 25 April this position was heavily bombarded with smoke and gas shells, followed at 05.00 by an infantry attack shielded by morning mist. At 06.45, a company of 1/6th Bn was reported to be fighting a rearguard action under Captain George Sanders (who had won a VC as a Corporal with 1/7th Bn at Thiepval in 1916). Sanders was seen rallying his men from the top of a pillbox and firing into the enemy with his revolver before he fell. (Wounded and taken prisoner, he was later awarded the Military Cross (MC) to go with his VC.) The frontline companies having been overrun, the rest of the brigade fell back through Vierstraat Cross to Ouerdom, where the enemy advance was halted. In two days' fighting (25–26 April) the 6th Bn lost 22 officers and 461 other ranks. At Ouerdom on 27 April, the remnants of the brigade were temporarily formed into a composite battalion under the command of Major R. Clough of 6th Bn and placed in divisional reserve.Magnus, pp. 94, 184–91.Middlebrook, p. 224, Appendix 4. Hundred Days Offensive The battalion returned to the fighting during the Allied Hundred Days Offensive. During the pursuit to the River Selle, 49th Division was ordered to attack on 12 October, but patrols found that the enemy had disappeared, so the barrage was cancelled and zero hour was brought forward. 146th Brigade reached the Villers-en-Cauchies railway before 13.00 and after a second advance the division established a line along the edge of the high ground overlooking the Selle, the opposite bank of which was strongly held. The other brigades failed to close up to the river next morning, but on 14 October the division seized Saulzoir and established small bridgeheads over the Selle.Edmonds & Maxwell- Hyslop, pp. 259, 262, 264.Magnus, pp. 218–9. After the BEF had forced the river line (the Battle of the Selle), there was a pause before the next bound of the pursuit. On 29 October 146th Bde returned to the line in front of Valenciennes, and on 1 November it stormed across the Rhonelle (the Battle of Valenciennes).Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 396, 455, 458.Magnus, p. 219. The division was relieved after this attack, and its infantry was still resting near Douai when the Armistice with Germany came into force on 11 November. 6th West Yorkshires served in Occupation Forces before demobilisation began in January 1919. This was virtually complete by the end of March, but the battalion was not formally disembodied until 30 March 1920.Barker, p. 56. 2/6th Battalion 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division's pelican sign (called a duck by the troops): 'when t'duck puts foot down, t'war'll be ower'. This battalion formed at Bradford on 12 September 1914, and became part of the 2/1st West Riding Bde in the 2nd West Riding Division. These were later numbered 185th Brigade and 62nd Division respectively.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 41–8.Barker, p. 55.62nd Div at Long, Long Trail.Wyrall, p. 3. 2/6th West Yorkshires had recruited 1500 men by November 1914, but until April 1915 they had no weapons with which to train. Some Lee-Enfields were then received, but these were withdrawn in May, and until the beginning of 1916 the 2nd Line Territorials had to make do with .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles, keeping their ammunition in their pockets until 1914 pattern webbing equipment arrived. With these antiquated weapons the 62nd Division was under orders to move at short notice to defend the East Coast, for which railway trains were kept in readiness. Training was also disrupted by the frequent calls to supply reinforcement drafts to the 1st line serving on the Western Front. In May 1915 the Home Service men of 185th Bde were withdrawn to form 26th Provisional Battalion serving in coast defence in North East England. In October, the division's 2nd Line battalions were reduced to 600 all ranks, the unfit men being posted to the 26th Provisional Bn and the surplus to the 3rd Line, which became the draft-finding unit.Magnus, pp. 73-4. In May 1915 the division moved into camp in 'The Dukeries' of Nottinghamshire, with the 2/6th Bn at Thoresby Park, where it trained until October. Then the division concentrated round Retford before going into the Tyne defences where it dug an entrenched defence line in December. It moved to Larkhill Camp on Salisbury Plain for battle training in January 1916 and finally received SMLE Mk III rifles and Lewis guns, but in June it was sent to the East Coast defences once more, where it was scattered round East Anglia. Here battle training was less convenient and it was againe called upon to provide drafts to the Western Front. In October it moved inland to Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire.Magnus, pp. 74–6.Wyrall, pp. 6–7. Finally, in October 1916, orders were received to bring the division up to full establishment and prepare for overseas service. 185th Brigade embarked at Southampton on 8 January 1917, and the division completed its concentration in France on 18 January, with 2/6th WestYorks under the command of Lt-Col John Hastings.Magnus, pp. 76–8.Wyrall, p. 9. The division took its place in the line in the Somme sector opposite Serre. Shortly afterwards, the German army began a planned retreat to the Hindenburg Line and from 15 February to 19 March the division's units were engaged in patrol work and stiff actions against rearguards while advancing across the devastated (and booby-trapped) ground until that line was reached. The division was then shifted to the line opposite Bullecourt in the southern part of the Arras sector, with 2/6th West Yorkshires at St Leger in brigade reserve.Magnus, pp. 117–23.Wyrall, pp. 15–35, 38. Bullecourt The Arras Offensive of 1917 opened on 9 April and the 62nd Division was prepared to advance if the attack on nearby Neuville-Vitasse succeeded. 2/6th West Yorkshires at St Leger were ordered to hold themselves in readiness to advance at one hour's notice in the afternoon. Despite brilliant success further north, the attack failed at Neuville-Vitasse, and the battalion had still not moved before dark on 10 April. It then made a night march to attack Bullecourt from the south west at 04.30 on 11April. However, Lt-Col Hastings reported three times in two hours that the necessary conditions for his attack had not been met: no tanks had appeared to support the attack (nine out of 11 hd been knocked out and the remaining two were missing), and there was no sign that the neighbouring Australian troops had entered Bullecourt. He was ordered to take immediate action to clear up the situation in Bullecourt without waiting for the tanks. Hastings insisted that a daylight attack (it was now 11.00) without cover could not succeed against uncut wire. Three hours later Brigade HQ accepted the situation and ordered Hastings to withdraw his patrols and relieve 2/7th Bn holding the front line trenches. The next day was spent probing the defences of Bullecourt before the battalion was relieved by the 2/7th Bn. The cancelled operation cost the 2/6th Bn two officers and 31 other ranks killed, together with 30 wounded. Nine men were dug out alive by 174th Tunnelling Company, Royal Engineers, from a collapsed house.Magnus, pp. 129–32. Hastings was awarded a DSO for his efforts at Bullecourt.Magnus, pp. 143–4, Appendix II.London Gazette, 7 August 1917.Wyrall, p. 43.] 185th Brigade held the line in abominable conditions and under shellfire for a week, and was then relieved for rest. A renewed attack on Bullecourt was made on 3 May. 62nd Division spent the preceding 17 days in rehearsals and the whole division attacked in waves behind tanks and a heavy barrage. 185th Brigade on the right, with 2/6th West Yorkshires on the extreme right, was tasked with taking Bullecourt itself. No man's land was 990 yards wide and swept by machine gun fire from the right (in a gap between the 62nd and the Australians): in the smoke and confusion the 2/6th Bn sheered off to the left and lost touch with the rest of the division. Large numbers of the battalion's men were lying dead and wounded in the wire, and a company of 2/7th Bn went forward to try to make contact but were driven back. Of the rest of the 62nd Division, only a few parties got into the German positions. The survivors of 2/6th Bn drifted back to their starting positions, and were then withdrawn to reorganise. It was not until 17 May that the division finally cleared the village, and operations against the Hindenburg Line continued until 28 May.Magnus, pp. 131–6.Wyrall, pp. 46–56. After rest and reorganisation, 62nd Division returned to the line in June and began a period of several months of trench-holding. On the night of 1 September, C Company of 2/6th Bn successfully raided Ostrich Avenue and Sunken Road, destroying dugouts and taking prisoners. At dawn on 13 September 1917 the battalion suffered a retaliatory raid. It was holding the Apex, a captured section of the Hindenburg Line near Riencourt, when a force of German Stormtroopers raided the position with orders to destroy all the dugouts and inflict as much damage as possible. The raiders reached as far as the support trench but were repulsed largely through the efforts of Capt G.C. Turner, who was killed, and Lance-Serjeant W. Pearson who was fatally wounded.Magnus, p. 145.Wyrall, pp. 59–67. Cambrai Mark IV Tank (female) training at Wailly 21 October 1917 for the Battle of Cambrai. 62nd Division moved into hutments at Beaulencourt in October 1917, where it trained for open warfare in preparation for the forthcoming Battle of Cambrai, including training with the Tank Corps at Wailly. On the night of 17/18 November 185th Bde took up its positions in Havrincourt Wood.Cooper, pp. 65–7.Magnus, pp. 146–8.Miles, p. 33.Wyrall,p. 68. The surprise attack was launched at dawn on 20 November, with no preceding bombardment; the artillery crashed down on its targets at zero hour. The brigade advanced with Mark IV tanks of G Battalion and a company of I BattalionTank Corps towards its first objective, Havrincourt village. The tanks had been held up by fallen trees in Havrincourt Wood and 185th Bde made a ragged start. 2/6th West Yorkshires under Lt-Col C.H. Hoare, with a company of 2/5th Bn and a section of 212th Company Machine Gun Corps under command, had some difficulty clearing the German outpost line, which was too near the British trenches to be bombarded. Nevertheless, A Company stormed the Hindenburg front line and entered the village from the east. Here they were held up by machine gun fire from II Battalion of the German 84th Infantry Regiment under Captain Soltau. The first tank, G3 commanded by Lieutenant William McElroy, now arrived on the west side of the village and made its way up the main street until its fuel tank was hit and the fire forced the crew to bale out. B and D Companies of the 2/6th Bn followed up and captured the village, driving Soltau and his men back to their battalion HQ at a farmhouse. Shortly after 08.45 the rest of the British tanks and infantry arrived and wiped him and his party out. It took the battalion another two hours to clear the maze of dugouts under the chateau while the rest of the brigade passed on to the second objective. By 11.30 the British had taken almost the whole of the Hindenburg Main and Support Lines over the frontage of the attack. 186th (2/2nd West Riding) Brigade then passed through to the next objective at Graincourt. Further progress was held up by the failure of 51st (Highland) Division to take Flesquières, leaving 62nd Division's right flank uncovered.Cooper, pp. 97–9, 109–10.Magnus, pp. 149–51.Miles, pp. 28, 59–62, 84–7.19 Company at Cambrai, at Landships of WWI.Wyrall, pp. 75–81, 90, 108. The divisional objective for the second day of the attack (21 November) was Bourlon Wood, led by 186th Bde with 185th Bde in close support. However, there were fewer tanks available and progress was slower than on the first day. Anneux was taken but Bourlon Wood remained out of reach. 185th Brigade relieved 186th in the ill-defined front line after dark. At dawn on 22 November a heavy barrage came down on 2/6th West Yorkshires, who were also attacked by German aircraft. The following German infantry pushed the battalion back; a partial recovery was stopped by a second German attack that crumpled up the line on the left and the battalion, minus most of its frontline officers, retreated until it rallied on the Bapaume–Cambrai road. 62nd Division was relieved by 40th Division in a tricky operation that night.Cooper, pp.129–31, 141.Magnus, pp. 151–2.Miles, pp. 93, 111–4, 121–6.Wyrall, pp. 95, 103–7. The division was back in Bourlon Wood on 27 November for another attempt to complete its capture, for which 185 Bde was in support, relieving 187th Bde at the end of the day. The division succeeded in taking the last of Bourlon Ridge, which had been fought over for a week. The exhausted West Riding division was then relieved (under a hail of German gas shells) before the German counter-attack took back all the hard-won ground a few days later.Cooper, pp. 156–63.Magnus, pp. 157–8.Miles, pp. 147, 156–9, 167.Wyrall, pp. 116–9. Disbandment By the beginning of 1918 the BEF was suffering a manpower crisis and the decision was made to break up one battalion in each infantry brigade. 2/6th West Yorkshires was selected and most of its men were drafted as reinforcements to other units inside and outside 185th Brigade on 31 January 1918. Seven officers and 150 men went to 2/5th West Yorks and 9 officers and 300 men went to 2/7th West Yorks, while others joined 1/6th West Yorks in 49th Division (see above). The surplus men were sent to join remnants of 17 other battalions to form the 3rd Entrenching Battalion.Magnus, pp. 78, 167.Wyrall, pp. 124–5.'Entrenching Battalions', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/1. 3/6th Battalion The 3/6th Bn was formed at Belle Vue Barracks on 25 March 1915. It trained and supplied drafts to the 1/6th and 2/6th Bns. On 8 April 1916, while at Clipstone Camp in Nottinghamshire, it became 6th Reserve Bn, West Yorkshires, and then was absorbed into the 5th Reserve Bn West Yorkshires in the West Riding Reserve Brigade at Clipstone on 1 September 1916. ==Interwar== The TF reformed on 7 February 1920, and the 6th Bn West Yorkshires reformed as soon as the cadre was disembodied on 30 March. The TF was reoganised as the Territorial Army in 1921, with 6th Bn West Yorkshires once again in 146th (1st West Riding) Bde of 49th (West Riding Division).Titles and designations, 1927. Bradford Grammar School Cadet Corps was affiliated to the battalion. Anti- Aircraft conversion In the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA infantry battalions into searchlight (S/L) battalions of the Royal Engineers (RE). In 1937 the 6th West Yorkshires was selected for conversion, becoming 49th (The West Yorkshire Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers on 1 October, with HQ and 395–398 AA Companies based at Belle Vue Barracks. It was assigned to 31st (North Midland) AA Brigade, originally part of 2nd AA Division, but in the process of transferring to a new 7th AA Division forming to defend Yorkshire and the North Midlands.when war broke out in 1939.Frederick, pp. 859, 868.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 110, 114.Barker, p. 57. ==World War II== Mobilisation 90 cm 'Projector Anti-Aircraft', displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62–3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June, as international tensions increased, a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65–6, 371. Phoney war On the outbreak of war, 49th AA Bn was still part of 31st (North Midland) AA Brigade, covering the West Riding in 7th AA Division.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. 397 AA Company deployed as part of 39 AA Bde, which covered the area between the Humber Estuary and Sheffield.39 AA Bde War Diary 1939–41, TNA file WO 166/2272. During the Phoney War period, AA Command was desperate for men and equipment to meet its huge commitments. When the War Office released the first intakes of Militiamen to the Command in early 1940, most were found to be in low physical categories and without training. 31 AA Bde reported that out of 1000 recruits sent for duty, '50 had to be discharged immediately because of serious medical defects, another 20 were judged to be mentally deficient and a further 18 were unfit to do any manual labour such as lifting ammunition'.Routledge, p. 374. Fitness and training was greatly improved by the time Britain's AA defences were seriously tested during the Battle of Britain and Blitz. Blitz On 1 August 1940 the RE's AA units were transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA): the battalion became the 49th (The West Yorkshire Regiment) Searchlight Regiment, RA, and the AA companies were termed S/L Batteries.Litchfield, p. 259–60.Farndale, Annex M, p. 339.49 S/L at RA 39–45.Barker, p. 68. As the Blitz on British cities intensified in the autumn, AA Command created new formations, and 31st AA Bde moved to a new 10th AA Division, though it was still defending the industrial towns of West Yorkshire.10 AA Division at RA 39–45.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396.Farndale, Annex D, p. 260. For example, Sheffield was badly hit on 12 and 15 December, and Leeds on nine occasions, particularly on the night of 14/15 March 1941. Home defence Formation sign of 10 AA Division 49th S/L Regiment remained in the defences of the North of England for most of the war. The regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 234th S/L Training Rgt at Carlisle where it provided the basis for a new 549 S/L Bty formed on 16 January 1941. This battery later joined a newly-forming 91st S/L Rgt.Frederick, p. 862. 397 S/L Battery transferred away to 63rd (Queen's) S/L Rgt in the London area in January 1942, formally joining that regiment on 23 March.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81. When AA Command was reorganised in the autumn of 1942, 10th AA Division was absorbed by a new 5 AA Group.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82.

In August 1943 49th S/L Rgt moved to 50 Light AA Bde.Order of Battle of AA Command, 1 August 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/84.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, TNA file WO 212/85. North West Europe Although it remained within 5 AA Group, 50 LAA Bde was earmarked for a role in the Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord), with searchlight regiments specially trained to defend the bridgehead. These regiments avoided the worst of the manpower reductions being forced on AA Command, but on 1 June 1944 E Troop of 398 Bty transferred to be E Trp of 441 Bty in 64th S/L Rgt. After D-Day on 6 June 1944, 50 LAA Bde and 49th S/L Rgt were poised to cross to Normandy.Routledge, p. 304; Table XLIX, p. 319. However the searchlights of 50 LAA Bde were not required by 21st Army Group, and remained with Home Forces in England.Routledge, p. 339. By the latter part of 1944, the German Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious aerial attacks on the United Kingdom could be discounted. The War Office began reorganising surplus AA units in Home Forces into infantry battalions for duties in the rear areas.Routledge, p. 421. In October, 49th S/L Rgt was one of the units selected for conversion, and redesignated 49th (The West Yorkshire Regiment) Garrison Regiment, RA.Frederick, pp. 879–80. Meanwhile, 21st Army Group was suffering a severe manpower shortage in North West Europe, particularly among the infantry.Ellis, pp. 141–2. In early 1945 the War Office accelerated the conversion of surplus artillery into infantry units, primarily for line of communication and occupation duties, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service.Ellis, p. 369.Infantry Regiments RA at RA 39–45 49 Garrison Regiment was redesignated again, becoming 601 (The West Yorkshire Regiment) Infantry Regiment, RA in February. It went to North West Europe and did Line of Communication duty with Second Army, including service in Antwerp while that city was under attack by V-1 flying bombs.Ellis, Appendix IV, p. 380. After VE Day, the regiment became part of 306 Infantry Brigade (the former 55 AA Brigade) on occupation duties. The regiment was placed in suspended animation on 4 February 1946.601 Rgt at RA 39–45.306 Bde at RA 39–45.Joslen, p. 402. ==Postwar== When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the regiment was reformed at Bradford as 584th (Mobile) (The West Yorkshire Regiment) Heavy Anti- Aircraft Regiment, RA, equipped with heavy AA guns in 69 AA Bde (the former 43 AA Bde at Leeds). On 1 January 1954 it was re-equipped with light AA guns and altered its title accordingly.Frederick, p. 1024.Litchfield, Appendix 5.564–591 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.67–106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on.Watson, TA 1947. In March 1955, AA Command was disbanded and there was a major reduction in the number of AA units in the TA. 584 LAA Regiment amalgamated with the Bradford-based 270 (West Riding) Field Regiment, RA, to form 370 (West Riding) Field Regiment, in which the former 584 Rgt formed Q (The West Yorkshire Regiment) Battery. The combined regiment reverted to the number 270 in 1960 and the following year merged with 269 (West Riding) Field Regiment at Leeds to form 249 (The West Riding Artillery) Field Regiment, when its West Yorkshire Regiment lineage ended.Litchfield, pp. 255–60.266–288 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.235–265 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. ==Insignia== West Yorkshire Regiment cap badge During World War II the regiment wore an insignia on battledress consisting of a White Rose of York with green sepals on a rectangle divided horizontally buff over red (the regimental colours). In 1951 the regiment was officially authorised to wear the West Yorkshire Regiment cap badge as an arm badge, a custom continued in Q Bty of 370 Rgt. ==Honorary Colonels== The following officers served as Honorary Colonel of the unit: * Lt-Col H.S. Hirst, CB, former CO, 1890–99. * Col J.G. Wilson, CB, VD, appointed 16 August 1899 * Col Sir George Helme (later Mashiter), KCB, CMG, former commander of West Yorkshire Brigade, appointed 1 October 1907. * Brevet Colonel H.L.

She was one of the organizers of the first Queer Festival in Sarajevo and is known for her mixed media art works which explore questions of body, gender and sexuality. Selimovic has exhibited her work in over 30 museums, galleries and other venues in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany and the United States. As of 2017, she lives and works in the US. Selimovic identifies as a lesbian and gender-queer person. == Early years and education == Selimovic was born in Rijeka in Croatia in 1981, but grew up in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. When the war broke out in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Selimovic was 11 years old. During wartime, she was a dancer and dancing gave her strength to cope with living in besieged Sarajevo. She was raised by her grandparents and often watched her grandfather carve figurines out of wood to keep her entertained. She graduated in 2009 from the Academy of Fine Arts in Sarajevo and in 2015 she completed her MFA studies at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. ==Career==  Human rights work  Selimovic was a member of Organization Q, which was the first organization advocating to promote and protect the culture, identities, and human rights of queer persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The group organized the first Queer Sarajevo Festival in 2008 and faced a violent backlash. Selimovic's work Metal was being exhibited when the festival was attacked during its opening. Due to the death threats the organizers received and the physical attacks on the festival participants, Selimovic left for the US in 2009 where she was granted political asylum. Nine years later, in July 2017, Selimovic had an exhibition in Sarajevo, in which she presented eighteen fiber-glass works of gender non- conforming and trans* persons from Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Also in 2017, she curated an exhibition Body language in Washington DC consisting of paintings, photographs and video installations by seven queer artists and activists from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia.  Artwork  Selimovic's art uses different media including fiberglass, plaster, metal, foam and hair. Her art explores the spaces between the non-binary gender language and individual expression of sex and gender. In her metal works she portrays androgynous figures. Winter Mendelsen describes her work: Selimovic's source of inspiration comes from her own background as said in her artist statement: == Awards and recognition == In 2015, Selimovic received the Fine Arts Venture Fund Award by Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. In 2014, she received the Justine Cretella Memorial Scholarships for the Outstanding Achievement by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. In 2013 and 2014, she received a Merit Award and Scholarship from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. == References  External links == * Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:People from Rijeka Category:21st-century Bosnia and Herzegovina artists Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina women artists Category:Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts alumni Category:Queer artists Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina human rights activists Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina expatriates in the United States Category:Mixed-media artists Category:LGBT people from Bosnia and Herzegovina ","title":"Alma Selimovic"},{"id":"56049666","text":"Wallace Community College may refer to: *Wallace Community College (formally George C.

She was the first African-American female photographer whose work was acquired by the Museum Of Modern Art in New York City. ==Biography== Smith was born in Detroit, Michigan, and raised in Columbus, Ohio. After graduating from Howard University in 1973, she moved to New York City, where she found work modeling. While in New York she met photographer Anthony Barboza, who was an early influence. ==Artistic style== Smith's approach to photography has included in-camera techniques such as playing with focus, darkroom techniques like double exposure, collage techniques and paint on prints. Her work is less engaged with documentation of events than with expression of experience. It has been described as surreal and ethereal, as the New York Times observed: \\"Her work, personal and expressive, draws from a number of artistic sources, preeminently surrealism. She has employed a range of surrealist techniques: photographing her subjects from oblique angles, shooting out of focus or through such atmospheric effects as fog and shadow, playing on unusual juxtapositions, even altering or painting over prints.\\" Smith's early work was composed of photos that were shot quickly to produce elaborate scenes, and due to this process many of her photos have double dates. She has used the technique of hand-tinting in some of her work, notably her Transcendence series. Some of Smith's work displayed in the Museum of Modern Art depicts motherhood in Harlem. These photos are taken using a documentary style way of photographing these subjects. ==Career== Ming Smith with her work at Brooklyn MuseumSmith has photographed many important black cultural figures during her career, including Alvin Ailey and Nina Simone. In 1973 Smith was featured in the first volume of the Black Photographers Annual, a publication closely affiliated with the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and early 1970s. Smith had her first exhibition at Cinandre, a hairdressing salon, in 1973 as well. At Cinandre, she met Grace Jones, whom she photographed wearing a black and white tutu on occasion. Smith recalls that she and Jones would talk about surviving as black artists. Smith reflects on the memories by saying: \\"We came out of Jim Crow. And so just coming to New York and trying to be a model or anything was new.\\" Two years later (1975), Smith became the first female member of the Harlem-based photography collective Kamoinge, under director Roy DeCarava. The Kamoinge Workshop was founded in New York in 1963 to support the work of black photographers in a field then dominated by white men. The collective, which still exists today, has undertaken a range of initiatives, including exhibitions, lectures, workshops, and the publishing of portfolios for distribution to museums. Smith participated with Kamoinge in three groups shows in New York and Guyana. Smith dropped off a portfolio at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), where the receptionist mistook her for a messenger. When she returned, she was taken into the curator's office. Susan Kismaric named a price for Smith's work, which Smith declined due to the price not paying off her bills. Kismaric asked Smith to reconsider, which she eventually did. Shortly after, she became the first Black woman photographer to be included in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York City. In addition to the MOMA, Smith's art has been featured at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and the Smithsonian Anacostia Museum & Center for African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. Smith has twice exhibited at the Bellvue Hospital Centre in Morristown, New Jersey, through their Art in the Atrium exhibitions. The first was in 1995, for Cultural Images: Sweet Potato Pie, an exhibit curated by Russell A. Murray. In 2008 she contributed as part of the exhibition New York City: In Focus, part of Creative Destinations 2008 Exhibition of African American Art. Smith's photographs are included in the 2004 Ntozake Shange book The Sweet Breath of Life: A Poetic Narrative of the African-American Family and Life. In 2010, her work was included in MOMA's exhibition Pictures by Women: A History of Modern Photography. This exhibition recontextualized Smith's work alongside that of Diane Arbus and marked a growing interest in Smith's work. Organized by curator Roxana Marcoci, it was curated by Sarah Meister through the Department of Photography. In 2017, a major survey exhibition of Smith's work was held at the Steven Kasher Gallery in New York. The exhibition featured 75 vintage black-and-white prints that represented Smith's career. Smith has collaborated with filmmaker Arthur Jafa in the Serpentine Sackler Gallery's 2017 show, Arthur Jafa: A Series of Utterly Improbable, yet Extraordinary Renditions (Featuring Ming Smith, Frida Orupabo and Missylanyus). That same year, she was featured in the Tate Modern group exhibition Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power, curated by Mark Godfrey and Zoe Whitley. The show received international acclaim before traveling to Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Brooklyn Museum, The Broad, the de Young Museum of San Francisco and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Since then, Smith's work was featured in solo presentations by Jenkins Johnson Gallery both at Frieze New York and Frieze Masters in 2019, the former of which receiving the Frieze Stand Prize. In 2020, Ming's work will be included in the group exhibition Working Together: Louis Draper and the Kamoinge Workshop at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, VA. From there, the exhibition will travel to The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, CA, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY. In the Fall of 2020 the Aperture Foundation will be releasing a monograph on her work. Smith will also have work included in the major group exhibition Just Above Midtown: 1974 to the Present curated by Thomas Lax at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY, in 2022. Smith's work is in museum collections including the National Gallery of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Brooklyn Museum of Art, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Detroit Institute of Arts, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. ==Exhibitions== A selection of other exhibitions of Smith's work includes: * 1972 – Kamoinge Group Show; The Studio Museum in Harlem, New York * 1976 – Exposure: Work by Ten Photographers; Creative Artists Public Service Program, New York City * 1980 – Self-Portrait; Studio Museum of Harlem, New York, traveled to the Springfield Museum of Fine Arts, MA * 1981 – Artists Who Do Other Art Forms; Just Above Midtown Gallery, New York City * 1982 – Ming Smith; Eric Turner Salon, New York * 1983 – Contemporary Afro-American Photography; Allen Memorial Art Museum, Oberlin College, OH * 1984 – 14 Photographers; Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York * 1989 – Ming Smith, Anthony Barboza, Adger W Cowans, Robert Hale and Deborah Willis; Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, New York * 1993 – Ming Smith: in a Minor Key; Crawford and Sloan Gallery, New York City * 1995 – Cultural Images: Sweet Potato Pie; curated by Russel A.

The aircraft was an ATR 42-320 registered C-GWEA. On 13 December 2017, shortly after taking off from Fond-du- Lac, the ATR-42 lost altitude and hit the ground. All 25 passengers and crews initially survived the crash, but one passenger later died of his injuries in hospital. Investigation on the cause of the crash is still ongoing. == Aircraft == The aircraft was an ATR 42-320 registered C-GWEA and was equipped with two PW121 turboprop engines produced by Pratt & Whitney Canada. The aircraft entered service in 1991 with Aviación del Noroeste, and was later operated in different fleets including Zambia Airways, United Nations, Fly540, etc. The aircraft joined the fleet of West Wind Aviation in 2012, and was aged 26.8 years at the time of the crash. This type of aircraft has previously been associated with accidents due to ice forming on the wing in freezing weather. The most notable accident was American Eagle Flight 4184. Experts say that changes in procedures and aircraft systems have solved the problem. == Accident == Crash location of West Wind Aviation Flight 280 The accident took place on December 13, 2017. According to the weather forecast, it was cloudy with temperature as low as . At 6:15 pm local time, the aircraft began its takeoff roll from Fond-du-Lac Airport. During the initial climb stage, the aircraft lost altitude and impacted the terrain away from the runway. There was an trail of debris. The aircraft finally came to a stop in the upright position yet tilted to the right. The most serious damage was on the left side of the airframe, where it ruptured near seats Row 3. There was no explosion nor fires at the crash site, but fuel leaks were found by nearby residents who rushed over for rescue work. Rescue work was immediately launched by local residents. Some of them followed the screams and rushed to the crash site near the airport, helping people to get out. The passengers also struggled to save themselves. Four of them tried for half an hour and managed to open the emergency exit door. Other passengers left the aircraft and guided local residents to the crash site. People sent out alerts through Facebook, calling for more resources, and in 10–20 minutes more people arrived with blankets. Within a few hours, all aircraft occupants were rescued. Royal Canadian Mounted Police finally took over the crash site. There were 25 people on board, including 22 passengers, 2 pilots and 1 flight attendant. Nobody was killed initially, but six passengers and one crew member received serious injuries, at least five of whom were transported to hospital via air ambulance. The other 18 aircraft occupants received minor injuries. Passenger Arson Fern Jr., a 19-year-old, died on 25 December 2017 as a result of his injuries. == Investigation == Transportation Safety Board of Canada launched the investigation. BEA, ATR (aircraft manufacturer), Pratt & Whitney Canada (engine manufacturer), and Transport Canada also sent representatives to the site. Flight recorders were recovered and sent to the lab in Ottawa. West Wind Aviation's air operator certificate was suspended on 22 December 2017 by Transport Canada, due to deficiencies in the company's operational control system. They were allowed to fly again on May 8, 2018, after West Wind cooperated with the TSB and implemented the necessary operational changes. ==See also== *American Eagle Flight 4184 *Ice protection system == References  External links == * * Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2017 Category:Accidents and incidents involving the ATR 42 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Canada Category:2017 disasters in Canada Category:2017 in Saskatchewan Category:December 2017 events in Canada ","title":"West Wind Aviation Flight 280"},{"id":"56049744","text":"*\\"Last Voyage\\" Live at Innercity: Amsterdam RAI Tiësto *The Last Voyage (Doctor Who) audio Doctor Who story *The Last Voyage 1960 American disaster film ","title":"Last Voyage"},{"id":"56049790","text":"Sheikh Mujibur Rahman: Voted as the Greatest Bengali of all time in the 2004 BBC opinion poll Soon after the completion of 100 Greatest Britons poll in 2002, the BBC organized a similar opinion poll to find out who is the greatest Bengali personality in Bengali nation's history of thousand years. In 2004, BBC's Bengali Service conducted the opinion poll with the title Greatest Bengali of all time started from February 11 continued onto March 22. The poll was participated by Bengalis around the world including from Bangladesh, India (states of West Bengal, Tripura, Orissa, and Assam) and overseas Bengali communities. No individual from the Bengal Sultanate and Mughal Bengal were nominated however. Total 140 nominations had been produced from the poll. BBC started to announce the top 20 names from 26 March declaring one name each day starting from 20th position. On the final day of 14 April, which was also the Pahela Baishakh (Bengali New Year day), BBC announced Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh as the Greatest Bengali of all time voted by Bengalis worldwide. ==Methodology== Describing the process of voting, BBC's Bengali Service stated that to avoid any flaw or controversy, they followed the most modern method of opinion polling. Participants were asked to nominate their five choices of greatest Bengali on the order of preference instead of one. The top nominee of each voter was given five points, second nominee four points, thus eventually the fifth nominee got one point. On the basis of total points, the final list of the greatest Bengali poll was generated. ==Observations== BBC informed that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman bagged almost double points than the second place holder Rabindranath Tagore, while Tagore himself secured double points than Kazi Nazrul Islam and Nazrul got double than A. K. Fazlul Huq. The other 17 personalities however had narrow differences of points with each other. Along with highest six politicians, the list also contains several authors and social reformers.

A galactic superwind, or just galactic wind, is a high velocity stellar wind emanating from either newly formed massive stars, spiral density waves, or as the result of the effects of supermassive black holes. They are normally observed in starburst galaxies. == Description == Galactic winds are strong stellar winds made up of charged particles, ejecta, and varying amounts of hot and cool gas, interacting with enough force that the ejecta's kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy. The resulting effect is a massive gust of rapidly expanding super-heated gases that can span the length of a galaxy. In galaxies with active galactic nuclei, galactic winds can also be driven by the effects of super-massive black holes. Galactic winds are considered an important function in the evolution of a galaxy. The winds cause an outflow of gas and other materiel into the halo of a galaxy, while also facilitating the spread of metals around a galaxy. Galactic winds are also capable of blowing material out of a galaxy entirely and into the intergalactic medium.  Formation  Superwinds are theorized to form in compact starburst galaxies in which star growth is much higher than in other types of galaxies. This accelerated star growth results in more prevalent stellar winds being present in starburst galaxies. Superwinds form when ejecta released either by supernovae or solar winds collide with such force that the shock from the impact converts the kinetic energy of the ejecta into thermal energy. The violent conversion from kinetic to thermal energy prevents a significant amount of energy from being radiated away. This in turn creates an incredibly hot bubble of gas that is under much greater pressure than it surroundings are. Eventually the gas bubble will expand to encompass other particles of ejected gases, further increasing the force and size of its expansion. This \\"snowplow\\" effect results in a gust of stellar wind and gas that can span the width of a galaxy. It has been theorized that superwinds can potentially be traveling at a velocity of several thousand kilometers per second by the time they enter the intergalactic medium. == References == Category:Stellar evolution Category:Solar phenomena Category:Stellar phenomena ","title":"Galactic superwind"},{"id":"56049876","text":"The Ranger Way: Living the Code On and Off the Battlefield is a book by former Army Ranger Kris Paronto that was published in 2017.

This was the most senior Chinese position in the colonial civil bureaucracy of the Dutch East Indies. As Majoor, Lie was also the Chairman of the Chinese Council of Batavia (Dutch: Chinese Raad; Bahasa Indonesia: Kong Koan), the city's highest Chinese government body. ==Life== A photograph of Batavia in 1875 (a year before Lie's elevation to the Captaincy) Lie Tjoe Hong Sia was born in 1846 in Batavia into a prominent, bureaucratic family of the local Chinese gentry (baba bangsawan). His father, Lie Pek Thaij (1809 - 1848), was an honorary Kapitein der Chinezen, while his grandfather, Lie Tiang Ko (1786 - 1855) served as der Chinezen (1847 - 1850), then Kapitein der Chinezen (1850 - 1855) under Tan Eng Goan, the first Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia. Two of Majoor Lie Tjoe Hong's uncles, Kapitein Lie Pek Tjiat and Lie Pek Tat, also served as Chinese officers. He bore the hereditary title 'Sia' as a descendant of Chinese officers. His own bureaucratic career began with an appointment as der Chinezen of the outlying district of Lonthar Tanara in Banten from 1866 until 1869. From 1872 until 1876, he served as der Chinezen in Batavia under his predecessor, Tan Tjoen Tiat, the city's second Majoor der Chinezen. Lie Tjoe Hong was elevated to the higher post of Kapitein der Chinezen, which he held from 1876 until 1879. When Majoor Tan Tjoen Tiat retired from his post, Lie was appointed by the colonial government to succeed the former as third Majoor der Chinezen. In February 1891, in recognition of the Majoor's 20 years of government service as a Chinese officer, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Star for Loyalty and Merit by Royal Decree. Majoor Lie Tjoe Hong served in office until 20 July 1896, when he resigned. Lie died six days after his resignation, and was buried in Grogol, Batavia. His son, Kapitein Lie Tjian Tjoen (1886 - 1964), would continue the family tradition of public service, and served as both a Chinese officer and member of the Chinese Council. His daughter-in-law, Ny. Kapitein Lie Tjian Tjoen (born Aw Tjoei Lan), was a prominent philanthropist and founder of the charity organisation Ati Soetji. The Majoor's son-in-law, Hok Hoei Kan (1881 - 1951), was the most prominent politician of the centre-right political party Chung Hwa Hui (CHH) in the first half of the twentieth century, and served in the Volksraad (colonial parliament) of the Dutch East Indies. ==Titles and styles== *1846 – 1866: Lie Tjoe Hong Sia *1866 – 1876: Lie Tjoe Hong, Luitenant der Chinezen *1876 – 1879: Lie Tjoe Hong, Kapitein der Chinezen *1879 – 1891: Lie Tjoe Hong, Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia *1891 – 1896: Lie Tjoe Hong, Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia, Groote Gouden Ster voor Trouw en Verdienste ==References== Category:1846 births Category:1896 deaths Category:Sia (title) Category:People from Batavia, Dutch East Indies Category:People of the Dutch East Indies Category:Indonesian people of Chinese descent Category:Indonesian Hokkien people Category:Kapitan Cina in Indonesia ","title":"Lie Tjoe Hong"},{"id":"56049995","text":"Havilah is a place in the Hebrew Bible.

The church is ancient in origin, though the present building dates largely from the nineteenth century. ==Dedication== Denys is not a reference to Denis, the patron saint of Paris. The name is a locally created corruption of Dionysius, the Latin name used by Saint Isan. ==Early History== The precise date of the church's founding is unknown, though it is thought to date from around the same period as St Isan's in nearby Llanishen (which chose to dedicate itself to Isan's Celtic name), which would give an estimated date of around the 6th Century. The founder of the religious presence in the area is also unknown. It has been speculated that monks from Llandough, or possibly an influential landowner was responsible, though this is conjectural since no historical evidence concerning the church has survived from this period. The original structure would probably have been built of impermanent materials, as was common practice at this time (St Isan's is believed to have also began life in this form). The stone churches which replaced such constructions did not begin to proliferate until the Norman period, during which the church was a chapel of ease to St Mary's in Cardiff, which was still a separate and quite distant town. ==Later Rebuilds== The present building dates mostly from the 14th century. The church fell increasingly into decay in later centuries. By the 1840s, it was all but derelict, with a tiny congregation. Having passed centuries as a little-changed village, Lisvane began to expand in the later 19th century, and after 1861, the church's fortunes began to revive as Lisvane began to develop into an affluent suburb. In 1878 it was decided to restore the church, and it was comprehensively refurbished by architect Edwin Seward. Further modifications occurred in the 1920s and 30s, and in 1979, the whole building was reordered and enlarged, with the alter re-sited and the choir housed in the old sanctuary. The only surviving Norman elements of the building are the walls of the tower and the southern doorway. ==Listing== The church gained Grade II* Listed status in 1963. ==References== Lisvane Lisvane Lisvane ","title":"Church of St Denys, Lisvane"},{"id":"56050033","text":"Alvin Cruz (born April 24, 1982) is a professional basketball player who played for the Niagara University men's university basketball team from 2001 to 2005.

Produced by Vallurupalli Ramesh Babu under Maharishi Cinema banner, the film stars Nandamuri Kalyan Ram, Diya, Chalapathi Rao, and Ravi Kale. Music was scored by Chakri, while Vikram Dharma choreographed the action sequences. The film follows Pardhoo, a Vizag-based college student who refuses to be a bystander while something evil is happening in front of him. Unable to tolerate injustice, he decides to fight a gang led by Hyderabad-based criminal brothers named Prakash and Thambi. The film's script was developed by Anil Krishna while he was in Mumbai. He wanted to cast Kalyan Ram after watching a promo of his film Toli Choopulone. As Kalyan Ram was busy shooting for Athanokkade with Surender Reddy, Krishna narrated the script to various actors including Kannada film actor Puneeth Rajkumar and producer Medikonda Murali Krishna who liked the script but couldn't work on it due to date issues. It was upon his return to Hyderabad that producer Vallurupalli Ramesh Babu asked him if he were interested in narrating a story to Kalyan Ram, and the actor immediately decided to work with Krishna upon listening to the script narrated to him within one and a half hours. The film was initially titled Parthu after the protagonist, but changes were made and the title was later changed to Asadhyudu. The film was released theatrically on 16 February 2006, receiving praise for Kalyan Ram's performance and action sequences. However, it failed commercially at the box office. It has been dubbed into Hindi as Sarfarosh The Burning Youth. == Plot == Pardhoo (Nandamuri Kalyan Ram), a college boy who hates to see inequality around him, fights a dangerous criminal gang in Hyderabad run by two brothers Prakash (Ravi Kale) and Thambi. == Cast == * Nandamuri Kalyan Ram as Pardhoo * Diya as Madhuri * Ravi Kale as Prakash * Chalapathi Rao as Pardhu's father * Kavitha as Pardhu's mother * Vinayakan as Thambu * Charan Raj as Raghunath * Satyam Rajesh as Pardhu's friend * Ahuti Prasad as ACP Ram * Sudeepa Pinky as Pardhu's sister * Vinod Kumar as ACP Ravi Varma * Raghu Babu as Govind, Prakash's henchman * Krishna Bhagavan as Prakash's lawyer * G.

It is located about 2,840 light-years (870 parsecs, or nearly km) from Earth in the constellation Draco. The exoplanet is the eighth in the star's multiplanetary system. As of December 2017, Kepler-90 is the star hosting the most exoplanets found. Kepler-90i was found with the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured, and by a newly utilized computer tool, deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms. ==Characteristics== Mass, radius and temperature Kepler-90i is a super-Earth exoplanet with a radius of 1.32 , indicating that it is small enough to be rocky. With an Earth-like composition, Kepler-90i would have a mass of about 2.3 , since its volume is 1.32^3 \\\\approx 2.3 times that of Earth's. It has an equilibrium temperature of , similar to the average temperature of Venus. Host star The planet orbits Kepler-90, a G-type main sequence star. The star has a mass of 1.2 and a radius 1.2 . It has a surface temperatures of 6080 K and has an estimated age of around 2 billion years, with considerable uncertainty. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 14. It is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. Orbital characteristics Kepler-90i orbits its host star about every 14.45 days with a semi-major axis of 0.107 AU. Due to its very close distance to its host star, it is likely to be tidally locked, meaning that one side permanently faces the star in eternal daylight and the other side permanently faces away from the star in eternal darkness. ==Discovery== In 2009, NASA's Kepler spacecraft was observing stars on its photometer, the instrument it uses to detect transit events, in which a planet crosses in front of and dims its host star for a brief and roughly regular period of time. In its last test, Kepler observed stars in the Kepler Input Catalog, including Kepler-90; the preliminary light curves were sent to the Kepler science team for analysis, who chose obvious planetary companions from the bunch for follow-up at observatories. Discovery of the exoplanet was aided by a newly utilized computer tool, deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms.

He was born in Leeton, Missouri. He began to study engineering at the University of Nebraska before he travelled around the Middle East and North Africa, which inspired him to become a painter. He studied painting in Vienna in 1922–1925. He then moved to Paris where he studied at the Académie des Beaux-Arts and was influenced by fauvism and cubism. He was also associated with the dancer Isadora Duncan as well as the Montparnasse model Kiki, who also modeled for Man Ray. After time in North Africa and Dominica, where he bought a coconut and lime plantation, he returned to the United States in 1932 following his father's death. He settled in New Orleans where he would live from 1932 until his death in 1964. He was active in the city's art community and his European style was well received. He was described as the \\"dean of modern art\\" in New Orleans. he was married twice and has one daughter. Paul Ninas’ work is pivotal in the development of modern art in the South and, more particularly in New Orleans. Through Ninas’ work as a teacher and as an active exhibiting artist, he introduced European modernist ideas to what had been hitherto a fairly traditional way of making art in the South. Aside from the obvious comparisons to Gauguin, the later work of Ninas is a dialogue with Pablo Picasso and translating his synthetic Cubist style into distinctly Southern subjects. Ninas especially sees New Orleans through a Cubist lens, depicting cemeteries, Mardi Gras parades and harbor scenes with angular, colorful flair. ==References== Category:1903 births Category:1964 deaths Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:American planters Category:Painters from Missouri Category:People from Johnson County, Missouri ","title":"Paul Ninas"},{"id":"56050629","text":"Gaber Abouzeid (born 20 June 1954) is an Egyptian volleyball player.

Under the IM cover- name \\"Angelika\\" she served as an agent of the \\"Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung\\" / HVA which was in effect the foreign intelligence service of the East German Ministry for State Security (Stasi). == Life == Lilli Margarethe Pöttrich was born in Wiesbaden, the elder of her parents' two daughters. Raimund Pöttrich, her father, was a port worker and trades-union activist in Düsseldorf-Eller and then in Düsseldorf-Benrath, where she attended a Roman Catholic primary school.Heribert Schwan, Helgard Heindrichs: Das Spinnennetz. Stasi-Agenten im Westen: Die geheimen Akten der Rosenholz-Datei. Knaur Verlag, München 2005, She moved on to the nearby Annette von Droste Hülshoff Gymnasium (secondary school) where she completed her school final exams (Abitur) in 1973. While still at school, she was sufficiently impressed by the Ostpolitik strategy being pursued by the West German chancellor, Willy Brandt, to join his political party, the centre-left Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). Passing the Abitur opened the way to a university level education and Pöttrich progressed to Frankfurt University where she started work on her Law degree. Early on during her university career she became a member of the recently formed \\"Socialist University Association\\" (\\"Sozialistischer Hochschulbund\\" / SHB), an activist grouping closely aligned to the (West German) SPD. It was as an SHB delegate that she participated in a student visit to Potsdam in East Germany, at the invitation of the FDJ (\\"Free German Youth\\" \\"Freie Deutsche Jugend\\"). The FDJ was the youth wing of East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). During this visit officials of the East German Ministry for State Security (MfS / Stasi) had the opportunity to evaluate Pöttrich's political views and to identify her as someone who might be willing and able to work for them. They were right. Since Pöttrich was a West German citizen, resident in West Germany, the ministry department to which she was of particular interest was the \\"Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung\\" / HVA, described as the ministry's \\"foreign intelligence services\\" but which, because of the shared language and cultural histories and the opportunities these threw up, concentrated its activities almost exclusively on West Germany. No one approached the twenty-year-old law student on behalf of the ministry during her visit to Potsdam, however. Soon after returning to Frankfurt, Pöttrich received a visit from two East Germans. They were both Stasi collaborators, though it is not clear whether this aspect was spelt out at the time. They invited Pöttrich to become a member of an institution called the \\"Institut fur Imperialismusforsching\\" (\\"Institute for Research into Imperialism\\"). The proposition was contextualised as a form of opinion polling, and they invited her to visit East Berlin in order to progress their \\"interesting discussion\\" further. In Autumn 1975, she undertook her next trip to East Germany, where she met a man called Rüdi, who would later become her principal point of contact with her eastern spymasters. Conversation turned to espionage: it became apparent that her East German visitors earlier in the year had been conducting an unannounced \\"job interview\\". In January/February 1976, she formally joined the service during a visit to Strausberg in East Germany. She signed the standard secret service declaration of duty/obligation (\\"Verpflichtungserklärung\\") and chose her cover name: Angelika. Later that year, on the request of her new bosses, she switched from Frankfurt to the University of Cologne, conveniently half an hour down-river from Bonn, which at that time was West Germany's political and administrative capital. At Cologne, in parallel with her student studies, she compiled reports on the academic and social milieu. Using the tried and tested HVA communications techniques in which she had by now been schooled, she passed these to her handlers. She had regular meetings with secret service contacts during this time, in order to hand over her reports in the form of micro-film documents, and to receive operational instructions. In 1981, Pöttrich passed her level one national law exams accompanied by a \\"voll befriedigend\\" commendation. In December of that year, armed with a false passport, she travelled via Copenhagen to Schöneiche in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) where she met with a number of high-ranking officers, including Ralf-Peter \\"Rüdi\\" Devaux. A series of further clandestine meetings would follow in various foreign locations. It is clear that by this time Pöttrich was identifying with the GDR (East Germany). She even took East German citizenship. She joined the country's ruling SED (party) and, together with high-level MfS officers, mapped out a suitable long-term espionage strategy for herself. Their agreed first objective was that she should join the West German diplomatic service at the higher civil service grade (\\"Höherer Dienst\\"). That was achieved in 1982. In April 1983, she embarked on a traineeship in Bonn for Foreign Ministry work as a diplomatic attachée. She came through any necessary security checks without problems. In 1986, the West German authorities gave her a lifelong employment contract. The diplomatic career that followed took her first to Bangladesh and then, in December 1988, to the German embassy in Paris. In Paris, she worked as the deputy to the official in charge of the so-called \\"CoCom\\" section. That gave her access to key reports and minutes of meetings of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls. This international committee's principal purpose was to prevent the export of western technologies - especially military technologies - to countries under close Soviet influence or control. She prepared reports on these and passed them to her handlers. As the changes which led, in March 1990, to the end of the one-party dictatorship in East Germany unfolded, Pöttrich initially continued with her work for the eastern intelligence services. She had participated in more than sixty meetings with contacts from the East German intelligence services, and that the last of these meetings took place in Aachen in February 1990. She continued to work for the West German diplomatic service till 1 December 1993 when she was unmasked and arrested. Information about her work for the HVA appears to have reached the authorities from a copy of the so-called Rosenholz files, although details on this point are unclear. At the time of her arrest Lilli Pöttrich had recently been promoted to the rank of a senior councillor (\\"Vortragenden Legationsrätin\\") and appointed as head of the German consulate in Sibiu (formerly Hermannstadt), but she was arrested before she could take up this new appointment, and as a result of her arrest she was dismissed from public office. On 28 April 1995 the district high court in Düsseldorf sentenced Pöttrich to two years in jail for serious espionage offences, but the sentence was suspended, so that subject to various conditions she remained at liberty. Conviction was accompanied by a ban on working as a lawyer, but after this expired she returned to the profession, setting up in practice in Düsseldorf. She has been far more willing to speak freely to journalists and researchers about her espionage for East Germany than most of those who were involved in the HVA networks, although that does not preclude a certain studied vagueness on several aspects of those experiences. == Key statistics (selection) == According to information in the Sira database created, originally, by the HVA, between February 1984 and November 1986 Lilli Pöttrich delivered 38 important reports to her spymasters, of which 34 were considered worth passing on to the Soviet KGB (КГБ / security service). Out of 29 documents from her that were retained in the files of Department I/3 at the HVA, 17 were classed as \\"valuable\\" (\\"wertvoll\\") and one as \\"very valuable\\" (\\"sehr wertvoll\\"). This last comprised extracts from a discussion between foreign ministers Hans- Dietrich Genscher and George P. Shultz in December 1985.Der Bundesbeauftragte für die Unterlagen des Staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen DDR (Hrsg.): Hauptverwaltung A (HV A). Aufgaben – Strukturen – Quellen. (MfS-Handbuch).

The deliberately feminist themes she explores are realized through various mediums and serve to dissect the most intimate moments of human relationships. Drawing on the endlessly expressive qualities of film, performance, photography, and sculpture, Kellems Dominik explores objectification and the male gaze, human trauma, female sexuality, agency, and her own experience of loss and survival. Driven by a mission to speak to broad and diverse audiences and striving to disrupt the dogmas of the contemporary art market, Kellems Dominik’s work has been exhibited internationally both within and beyond the white-cube space of the traditional art gallery. Kellems Dominik has exhibited solo presentations at One Brooklyn Bridge Park with Chashama (New York), The Laundry (San Francisco), Ludlow House (New York), Onishi Project (New York), LaCuna Art Studios (Chicago), and at Coup d’Etat (San Francisco). Her sculptural installations have been exhibited internationally in collaboration with the PUBLIC Hotel (Chicago), the Nautilus Hotel (Miami), and the Freehand Hotel (Miami). Kellems Dominik has further presented her work on the international art fair circuit, including with the Armory Show (New York), Scope Art Fair (Miami), the Tokyo International Art Fair (Tokyo), the Affordable Art Fair (New York). Her first major public art installation was “I Can Feel” exhibited during Art Basel Miami Beach 2017. The work is composed of a neon sculpture and choreographed light performance, and Kellems Dominik’s largest neon work. Standing at 12′ tall, the 27.68 second neon performance illuminates the rising emotion and viscerally glorifies the female orgasm. Kellems Dominik lives and works between San Francisco, California, New York, New York, and Jackson, Wyoming. == Artwork Overview ==  Themes  Prompted by her 50th year of life, Kellems Dominik launched her artistic career with an investigation into conventional definitions of feminism, social justice and individual liberty. Kellems Dominik seeks to encourage the amplification of strong female voices with a focus on self-empowerment, pleasure, and the private-made-public. Her extensive and varied body of work is underscored by a profound empathy for the vulnerability of the human condition and for the principles that underlie our efforts to connect, communicate, and commune. Kellems Dominik’s work is characterized by her diligent research of our culture’s visual traditions, societal taboos, religious legacy, and the body of the individual. She often uses her own body to expose rigidly antiquated social constructs and to examine the role of female sensuality and agency in subversion of patriarchal social and aesthetic conventions.  Noteworthy Bodies of Work   I Can Feel  \\"I Can Feel\\" is a visually arresting neon sculpture and choreographed light performance. Standing at 12 feet tall, the 27.68-second neon performance illuminates with rising emotion and viscerally glorifies the female orgasm in its overt monumentality. Described as a work of emotional autobiography, the sculpture’s central feature is a 5’ 3.5” vagina, a number that symbolically represents the artist’s height. The viewer basks in an effusive pink and blue neon glow as the choreography elicits the warmth of human touch and the vindication of emotional redemption. The title of the work describes a self-affirmation, a personal breakthrough experienced in the wake of a mourned relationship, wherein the subject has progressed beyond the stages of grief to proclaim the achievement of self-empowerment and to ultimately embrace both physical and spiritual joy. The work has been exhibited at The Nautilus Hotel on Miami Beach, with Chashama at One Brooklyn Bridge Park, and at Ludlow House New York.  BADASSERY  As an ongoing tenet of her practice, Kellems Dominik develops a series of affirmative statements, colloquialisms, words, and phrases that are the emotional and intellectual scaffolding for her work collectively known as Badassery. These poems act as artist statements for each of her respective bodies of work. Beginning in 2019, the Badassery poems were activated both alone and in collaboration with an independent dance troupe assembled by the artist. Together the performers layered both choreographed and improvisational gestures and movements to the words of the Badassery poems. The artist documents the performances via simultaneous videography including 360-degree GoPro video, aerial drones, and hand-held cameras. The series remains ongoing. The original Badassery prints have been exhibited at The Laundry, San Francisco in 2019, with the Tokyo International Art Fair in May 2015, and at the Affordable Art Fair New York in 2014. The new body of Badassery poems have been activated with independent dancers, including with the Fullstop Dance troupe as part of the artist’s solo exhibition. In spring 2019, a preview of the new performance series was presented for the SF MoMA Spring Fling in association with their Modern Art Council patron group.  You Are Dead to Me  \\"You Are Dead to Me\\" is an ongoing project exploring ritualistic grief. The undertaking emerged as an outgrowth of the artist’s personal relationship to the process of mourning. The project is physically located in Jackson Hole, Wyoming and entails the methodical collection and numbering of 7,368 stones collected from the surrounding landscape. Stones of various size and weight were first hand-numbered by the artist in white Japanese ink and then placed strategically in numerical order in the form of an orderly grid. Following this months-long process, the artist constructed a rudimentary assemblage of PVC and V-struts to transport the stones across an active estuary to a small spit in the middle of the river. The artist arranged the stones in the form of a primitive tomb with a ceremonial promenade leading to the pinnacle of the grave. Exposed to the elements of the seasons and submerged beneath feet of snow, the work withstood for months before resurfacing below the spring run-off. Subjected to the velocity of the river’s undercurrent the grave was inevitably overtaken, destabilized, and reconfigured. The artist remains in the midst of recovering the stones that comprised the original formation. In August of this year, the artist endeavored to return to the artwork site to excavate the stones now distributed across the riverbed. A number have been recovered — many of which remain rooted in their original foundational location — yet many have yet to be rediscovered. The project is ongoing, yet already there emerges an understanding that while time may affect the surface, the truth is that grief remains rooted in the psyche as does the weight of stone. “This idea of maybe one or two items would be left behind like with our grief; it’s an analogy for my grief, you still wear it, just somewhere different,” Kellems Dominik tells Women’s Wear Daily in 2019.  INVISIBLE  \\"INVISIBLE\\" is a monumental installation featuring five, eleven-foot female soft-sculpture totems rendered in cotton-knit and wool. The sculpture pays symbolic homage to representations of the female body throughout art history — most notably the likes of the Venus of Willendorf and the caryatids atop Greece’s Erechtheion. Like the caryatids, the unique visages and bodies of Kellems Dominik’s soft-sculptures reflect the physical affliction of time, disease, trauma, and pain. The totemic females of INVISIBLE nonetheless reclaim their physicality to stand tall and unabashed, showcasing individual particularities of the aging female body brazenly in the nude. \\"INVISIBLE\\" was exhibited at the Nautilus Hotel, Miami Beach during Art Basel Miami Beach in 2018 and with The Laundry, San Francisco in 2019 for the artist’s solo exhibition An Excavation. == Speaking Engagements ==  Tracing Feminism  Tracing Feminism was an all-female panel discussion organized in conjunction with the New York debut of Suzy Kellems Dominik’s \\"I Can Feel.\\" Featured panelists traced representations of the female throughout art history, from the ancient to the contemporary. Delving further, panelists explored themes pertaining to equity and equal representation in the arts, symbolically mining the cultural archives, and embarking upon an investigation of alternative artistic practices, and non- profit art models that exist in the name of gender parity, equal opportunity, and visibility of the female experience. The panel launched anew the discourse surrounding \\"I Can Feel\\", extending themes of female creative representation into a richly layered discussion featuring panelists Jasmine Wahi, co-founder of Project for Empty Space in New Jersey and the Holly Block Social Justice Curator of the Bronx Museum, Kathleen Wentrack of QCC CUNY and The Feminist Institute, and artist Suzy Kellems Dominik.  Artful Storytelling  Artful Storytelling was an all-female panel discussion that took place during Miami Art Week in complement to the artist’s installation INVISIBLE. Featured panelists explored storytelling across various platforms, including visual art and digital media, and evolving modes of artist representation and the trends, both digital and analog, in the industry. The panel discussion comprised the following panelists: business strategist, social media consultant, and founder of the Realization Podcast, Idalia Salsamendi; Founder and Principal Advisor of the Yeelen Group, Karla Ferguson; and visual artist Suzy Kellems Dominik. The panel was moderated by Founder and Editor-in-Chief at Art Zealous and founder of House of Puff, Kristina Adduci. == Collaborations ==  Dangerous Dance (Donated to Watermill Center Summer Benefit Auction)  \\"Dangerous Dance\\" (2016) is a self portrait and time- based performance, a work of emotional autobiography consisting of a silent film structurally built upon a musical eight count. Through silence, the video invites viewers to project their own “internal soundtrack” onto the performance. \\"Dangerous Dance\\" comprises a body of work exploring and addressing the fundamental human need to be seen, heard, and valued in celebration of individuality. The short film draws inspiration from the esteemed choreographer Mark Morris, whose unbridled interpretation of what dance can be is embodied by Kellems Dominik and her collaborators. \\"Dangerous Dance\\" was exhibited at Coup D'État San Francisco in 2016 and a limited edition set of film stills with the accompanying video were donated to the Watermill Center Summer Benefit in 2019 as part of their benefit auction held in collaboration with Artsy. == Past Exhibitions ==  Beatrice: To Hell and Back  \\"Beatrice – To Hell and Back\\" is a multimedia, multidisciplinary contemporary re-imagination of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy and La Vita Nuova (1295) encapsulating the bitter irony of virtue and vice, rendered from the female perspective. The installation takes as its subject the moment in 1295 when Dante defines Beatrice as “beatific,” not because of who she is, but how she mirrors how he feels about himself. The artwork proceeds to retell the narrative from the point of view of Beatrice, a central character who acts as a foil for the vices exemplified by Dante’s host of characters in the Inferno. The jumping-off point is the famous quote:, “Abandon all hope ye who enter here.” The exhibition centerpiece is a gilded sculptural goat — Beatrice — who represents the artist’s alter ego poetically objectified. Ultimately, \\"Beatrice: To Hell and Back\\" is a maximalist experience — a simultaneously lush and luxuriant tirade on contemporary vanity, virtue, vice, and theatrics. \\"To Hell and Back\\" was exhibited at Onishi Project New York in 2014.  In Her Dreams  \\"In Her Dreams\\" is the third in a trio of multi-sensory installations dissecting human interaction, relationships, and expectations. The artwork explores the relationship between a young woman and her bed. \\"The bed serves as a partner – a reservoir for her hopes, dreams, and disappointments. I invite you to touch and investigate the many layers of the bed and to take photos in and amongst the sheets. For the truly adventurous, strip the bed down to the mattress cover, to where all implied promises go to die – in a wet spot.\\" \\"In Her Dreams\\" exhibited at Freehand Hotel Miami during the 2015 Art Basel Miami Beach, Coup D'État San Francisco in 2016, and at Éléphant Paname in Paris through \\"Condizione\\" curated by Prada architect Robert Baciocchi in 2018.  Hateful Love  An early incarnation of Kellems Dominik's signature Badassery series, \\"Hateful Love\\" communicates the polarity of love through striking text and soft, delicate imagery. \\"Hateful Love\\" exhibited at SCOPE Art Show, during the 2015 Art Basel Miami Beach.  Box of Sin  \\"Box of Sin\\" is the first work in a series of micro installations exploring the Seven deadly sins. The project integrates sculpture, multi-media photographic images, the written word, and a layered soundtrack. Produced in collaboration with Coup d'État, San Francisco 2014.  Bear Attack: The Urban Bear  In 2014, Kellems Dominik celebrated her first gallery exhibition with a body of work entitled \\"Bear Attack\\", the first in a trio of multi-sensory installations exploring the interpersonal relationships between men and women. The show combined a large-scale photographic triptych, the written word, a multi-layered soundtrack, video, taxidermy, and a cabinet of curiosities. The artwork was inspired by a sign seen in a national park, “Be alert. Make noise. Carry bear spray. Avoid hiking alone. Do not run.” Kellems Dominik found direct parallels to rape culture and the experience of being a woman; she sought to expose “the bears” that walk among us. “Terror is explored through three phases of a young woman’s life: youth, young adulthood, and established womanhood. Despite the young woman’s intelligence, worldliness, and command of her environment, she is unable to protect herself emotionally and/or physically from the insidious nature of the “Bear.” Love, hope, desire, need, and longing are perverted into something dangerous, terrifying, and unexpected.\\" The exhibition went on to show at Onishi Project and at Ian Schrager's Public Hotel in Chicago in 2014. ==References External links == * Category:Living people Category:American artists Category:American philanthropists Category:1961 births ","title":"Suzy Kellems Dominik"},{"id":"56050976","text":"Żurakowski is a Polish surname.

It is a specialist parasite of the larva of the mountain Alcon blue butterfly (Phengaris rebeli). ==Life cycle== The life cycle of I. eumerus is dependent on a butterfly, the mountain Alcon blue (Phengaris rebeli), the larvae of which trick ants in the species Myrmica schencki into carrying the larvae into their nest and caring for them as if they were ant larvae. The adult female wasp seeks out a nest of these ants; it seems to be able to tell by smell whether there are larvae of the butterfly present in the nest and if there are, it attempts to enter. The ants attack the intruder, but the wasp produces a pheromone that causes the ants to become confused and attack each other. This gives the wasp the chance to search out the butterfly larvae and lay an egg in each one. Afterwards the ants continue to feed and look after the butterfly larvae which in due course pupate. The wasp eggs hatch and the wasp larvae feed on the butterfly larvae from the inside, eventually pupating inside the butterfly pupae. ==Status== The mountain Alcon blue butterfly is a rare species which is known from the northern part of Portugal, the western Pyrenees, France, Switzerland, part of Germany and Greece at altitudes between . The butterfly is considered to be a \\"vulnerable species\\", and the wasp, being entirely dependent on the butterfly, would become extinct if the butterfly were to die out. == References == Category:Ichneumoninae Category:Insects described in 1857 Category:Hymenoptera of Europe ","title":"Ichneumon eumerus"},{"id":"56051104","text":"List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 1807 { class=\\"infobox\\" -  2nd UK Parliament  (1802) -  3rd UK Parliament  (1806) -   4th Parliament  (1807) -  5th Parliament  (1812) -  6th Parliament  (1818) } This is a list of the MPs or Members of Parliament elected to the House of Commons for the constituencies of the Parliament of the United Kingdom in the 1807 United Kingdom general election, the 4th Parliament of the United Kingdom, and their replacements returned at subsequent by-elections, arranged by constituency. __NOTOC__ { border=\\"0\\" id=\\"toc\\" style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\" align=center  Table of contents: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z By-elections Changes } {  -  colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"ccccff\\"  == A == -  Aberdeen Burghs (seat 1/1)  James Farquhar  -  Aberdeenshire (seat 1/1)  James Ferguson  Tory -  Abingdon (seat 1/1)  George Knapp – died Replaced by Henry Bowyer 1809 – resigned Replaced by Sir George Bowyer 1811  Whig Whig -  Aldborough (seat 1/2)  Henry Fynes  Tory -  Aldborough (seat 2/2)  Gilbert Jones  Tory -  Aldeburgh (seat 1/2)  Sir John Aubrey, Bt. – took office Replaced by Sandford Graham 1812  Whig -  Aldeburgh (seat 2/2)  John McMahon  Tory -  Amersham (seat 1/2)  Thomas Drake Tyrwhitt-Drake – died Replaced by William Tyrwhitt-Drake 1810  Tory -  Amersham (seat 2/2)  Thomas Tyrwhitt-Drake  Tory -  Andover (seat 1/2)  Thomas Assheton Smith I  Tory -  Andover (seat 2/2)  Newton Fellowes  Whig -  Anglesey (seat 1/1)  Berkeley Paget  Whig -  Anstruther Easter Burghs (seat 1/1)  John Anstruther – died Replaced by Sir John Anstruther 1811  -  County Antrim(seat 1/2)  Edmond Alexander MacNaghten  Tory -  County Antrim (seat 2/2)  Hon.

They are being developed by an interdisciplinary group of governmental and academic research partners. The initiative aims for a harmonised global biodiversity monitoring system. EBVs would be used to inform biodiversity change indicators, such as the CBD Biodiversity Indicators for the Aichi Targets. The concept is partly based on the earlier Essential Climate Variables. It can be generalised as the minimum set of variables for describing and predicting a system's state and dynamics. Areas with more developed EV lists include climate, ocean, and biodiversity. == EBV Classes / Categories == The current candidate EBVs occupy six classes of Essential Biodiversity Variable: genetic composition, species populations, species traits, community composition, ecosystem structure, and ecosystem function. Within each class are a few to several variables. { class=\\" mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\\" + !EBV Class !EBV !Notes -  rowspan=\\"4\\" Genetic composition Co-ancestry  - Allelic diversity  - Population genetic differentiation  - Breed and variety diversity  -  rowspan=\\"3\\" Species populations Species distribution Addressed in.

The GLOBIS-B global cooperation project, aimed to advance the challenge of practical implementation of EBVs by supporting interoperability and cooperation activities among diverse biodiversity infrastructures, started in 2015. The GlobDiversity project of GEO BON, led by the University of Zurich, started in 2017, focusing on specification and engineering of three RS-enabled EBVs. The scope and screening of potential variables is under ongoing discussion. This includes definition of the species distribution EBV and population abundance EBV, operationalisation of the EBV framework, data and tools for building EBV data products, workflow for building EBV data products, metadata and data sharing standards; and possible integration of abiotic variables (e.g. those emphasised in the Ecosystem Integrity framework) with biotic variables (emphasised in the EBV framework) to achieve comprehensive ecosystem monitoring. \\"EBV data products\\" refers to the end product in the EBV information supply chain, from raw observations, to EBV-usable data, to EBV- ready data, to EBV data products. Each of these three types of EBV datasets could be used to produce indicators. Data sources for EBVs are categorised into four types: extensive and intensive monitoring schemes, ecological field studies, and remote sensing. Each have their own often complementary properties, implying that data integration will be important for creation of representative EBVs, as well as identifying and filling data gaps. == References == Category:Biodiversity Category:International scientific organizations Category:Earth observation ","title":"Essential Biodiversity Variables"},{"id":"56051188","text":"Damak may refer to: ==Places== * Damak, a municipality in Nepal ** Damak Multiple Campus, a community campus in Damak, Nepal ** Damak Model Higher Secondary School, a secondary school also in Damak, Nepal ** Himalaya Higher Secondary School, Damak, Jhapa, a different secondary school in Damak, Nepal * Damak, Hungary, a village * , river in India * Damak-e Aliabad, a village in Iran * Damak (state constituency) in Pahang, Malaysia * , village in Serdang Bedagai Regency, North Sumatra Province, Indonesia * , village in Deli Serdang Regency, Indonesia * , ridge in Turkey * , village in Serdang Bedagai Regency, North Sumatra Province, Indonesia * , village in Serdang Bedagai Regency, North Sumatra Province, Indonesia * Kampung Damak, a polling district in Jerantut (federal constituency) * , village in Langkat Regency, North Sumatra Province, Indonesia ** , river in Indonesia * , point in Indonesia ==Other == * Damak, a 1967 film featuring Kasma Booty * Damak, a character in the 1977 film Jay Vejay ==See also== * DAMAC (disambiguation) ","title":"Damak (disambiguation)"},{"id":"56051192","text":"Cornelius M'Gelany was an Irish priest in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries: the first recorded Archdeacon of Kildare (1190-1206).\\"Fasti Ecclesiae Hibernicae: The succession of the prelates Volume 2\\" Cotton,H. p245Dublin, Hodges & Smith, 1848-1878 ==References== Category:12th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:Archdeacons of Kildare Category:13th-century Irish clergy Category:12th-century Irish people ","title":"Cornelius M'Gelany"},{"id":"56051204","text":"Hildegunn Eggen (born 27 July 1953) is a Norwegian actress.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It is now a bed and breakfast known as the Garfield Inn, named after US President James A. Garfield, a family friend of the Learneds and frequent guest. ==History== Charles G. Learned was born in 1816 in West Troy, New York. His father was a successful public works contractor, and in 1835 Charles won a contract under his father's name to build one mile of aqueduct for the City of New York. He married Maria Raymond in 1838 and continued to work on major public works contracts in New York and the surrounding states. Learned also established himself in both farming and lumbering in West Troy. During this time, he and his family met their lifelong family fried, future president James A. Garfield. Garfield was then a student, and made his home with the family between college terms. By the late 1850s, Learned became interested in the Michigan frontier, particularly in lumbering. In 1859, he consolidated, sold, or leased all of his business holdings in New York State, began new business ventures in Michigan, and moved to Port Austin with his family. Once in Port Austin, Learned acquired this property, which already had a dwelling located on it. The origin and ownership of the dwelling are unknown, but it was likely built some time between 1837 and Learned's arrival in 1859. Learned constructed an addition, doubling the area of the house. Learned quickly became involved in extensive business interests in the area, trading in general merchandise, sinking a salt well, and opening saw mill, a shingle mill and barrel factory, and a flour mill. In about 1866, the couple constructed a large addition onto the house. At about this time, Garfield, then in the US Senate, visited the Learneds, and was, in fact, a frequent guest throughout the 1860s. In 1870, Jonas Learned, Charles and Maria's only son, moved into the Port Austin house. He had been involved in lumber manufacturing and a successful mercantile enterprise in Port Crescent for some time, but opted to join the thriving community of Port Austin. Meanwhile, Charles Learned shifted his interest to agricultural products, and in 1871 Charles and Jonas collaborated to add, over a series of years, a number of Second Empire architectural details to what had to that time been an Italianate house. In 1874, Jonas sold his other businesses and joined his father's agricultural firm. Maria Learned died in 1881, and Charles followed in 1891. Jonas Learned and his family continued to live in the house until 1931, when it was sold to a local manufacturer, a Mr. Mayes. Mayes renamed the home the Mayes Inn, and operated it as a tourist home, bar, and restaurant. In 1946 it was purchased by a Mr. Neinaltowski, who changed the name to the Tower Hotel. In 1979, Edward and Diana Hilgendorf bought the Tower Hotel, but in 1982, they sold to Gail and Gary Regnier, who began an extensive restoration of the home. ==Description== The Charles G. Learned House is a prominent three-and-a-half story structure with distinctive Second Empire styling, reflecting several generations of construction. It has a mansard roof and a large front tower, both af which were likely c. 1870s additions to an earlier Italianate house. ==References * The Garfield Inn Category:National Register of Historic Places in Huron County, Michigan Category:Italianate architecture in Michigan Category:Second Empire architecture in Michigan Category:Houses completed in 1837 ","title":"Charles G.

Almost a year later to the day, Kudo marked her second appearance on Kōhaku Uta Gassen by performing \\"Koi Hitoyo\\". ==Background== \\"Koi Hitoyo\\" is a mid-tempo song written by Gorō Matsui and composed and produced by Tsugutoshi Gotō. The song was used in televised commercials for the Hakone Open-Air Museum. The lyrics of the song describe the thoughts racing through the protagonist's head as she spends the night with her lover for the first time. At the time of the recording, Kudo complained to her then-executive producer, Yūzō Watanabe, that she was having a hard time singing the song because the tessitura was too high. Watanabe assured her that \\"he liked the pain in her voice\\" and Kudo proceeded with recording \\"Koi Hitoyo\\" without changing the key of the song. She has since stated that Watanabe's encouragement helped her gain trust in his vision and that after that she always sang the songs they worked on together in the key he would suggest. ==Cover versions== In 2008, Acid Black Cherry recorded a cover of the song that was initially released as a B-side on his single \\"Fuyu no Maboroshi\\" and later included on his album, Recreation (2008). Maki Goto recorded a cover of \\"Koi Hitoyo\\" for her mini album Gloria (2011). Goto's version was released as a digital download on November 10, 2010 as a promotional single for the album. ==Chart performance== \\"Koi Hitoyo\\" entered the Oricon Singles Chart at number two, with 225,000 copies sold. The following week, it reached the top of the chart, where it stayed for two consecutive weeks. The song charted for a total of 21 weeks. It is Kudo's second best-selling single, behind \\"Dōkoku\\" (1993), with sales surpassing half a million copies. \\"Koi Hitoyo\\" ranked at number six on the year-end Oricon Singles Chart for 1989, and was one of three singles released by Kudo that year to rank in the yearly top ten. ==Track listingCharts== style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" Chart (1989) !scope=\\"col\\" Peak position !scope=\\"col\\" Sales - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Weekly Singles (Oricon)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1  rowspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\"607,000 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Monthly Singles (Oricon)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Yearly Singles (Oricon)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"6 } ==See also== * List of Oricon number-one singles ==References== Category:1988 songs Category:1988 singles Category:Songs with lyrics by Gorō Matsui Category:Songs written by Tsugutoshi Gotō Category:Oricon Weekly number-one singles Category:Songs used as jingles Category:Shizuka Kudo songs Category:Maki Goto songs Category:Pony Canyon singles ","title":"Koi Hitoyo"},{"id":"56051322","text":"Asliddin Khabibullaev (born 5 March 1971) is a former Tajikistan international goalkeeper player for Tajikistan, and current manager of FC Khatlon. ==Career statistics== International {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" - !colspan=3Tajikistan national team - !Year!!Apps!!Goals - 199930 - 200000 - 200100 - 200200 - 200380 - 200460 - 200500 - 200670 - !Total240 } Statistics accurate as of match played 2 July 2006 ==Honours== Team ;Varzob Dushanbe *Tajik League (1): 1999 *Tajik Cup (1): 1999 ;Vahsh Qurghonteppa *Tajik League (1): 2005 *Tajik Cup (1): 2003 Individual Tajik Player of the year (1): 2003 ==References== Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Tajikistani footballers Category:Tajikistan international footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers ","title":"Asliddin Khabibullaev"},{"id":"56051324","text":"Signý Hermannsdóttir (born January 16, 1979) is an Icelandic former basketball player.

From 1962 to 1963, he was a member of President John F. Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisors, where he began working after being brought to Washington, D.C. by Walter Heller. He is well known for his work on the Council, which played a major role in the design of the United States government's War on Poverty in the 1960s, including writing the chapter on poverty in the 1964 Economic Report of the President. This work led James Tobin to say in 1997 that Lampman was \\"the intellectual architect of the War on Poverty\\". After returning to the University of Wisconsin, he became also a major force behind the founding of the University's Institute for Research on Poverty in 1966, after which he served as its interim director until June of that year. He also became an early and outspoken advocate for a negative income tax, which eventually led to the introduction of the Earned Income Tax Credit. ==References== Category:1920 births Category:1997 deaths Category:University of Wisconsin-Madison alumni Category:University of Wisconsin-Madison faculty Category:People from Plover, Wisconsin Category:Economists from Wisconsin Category:20th-century American economists ","title":"Robert Lampman"},{"id":"56051524","text":"Candice Renoir is a French crime television series created by Solen Roy- Pagenault, Robin Barataud and Brigitte Peskine and is aired since 19 April 2013 on France 2. ==Plot== Candice Renoir, a mother of four children, resumes her job as a policewoman at the BSU in Sète (Hérault) after having stopped for ten years following a layoff.

His work tends to be dark, focusing on people’s need to avoid being alone, without trying to give solace to the reader about what he writes about. ==Life== Martín Briceño was born in Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico in 1966. He still lives here as he hates the cold and prefers the lifestyle. Despite being known as a writer, Martin is a long time businessman, known in southern Mexico. He majored in business administration in college, although he wanted to study literature. Despite the dark tones of his writing, his appearance is generally businesslike. He has been quoted saying that he considers having had two children in such a dark world to be a brave thing. Martín does not find his work in business and literature to be particularly compatible. However, he admits he has no desire to die hungry as a writer. While he does earn money as a writer, it is not enough. ==Writing career== Martin wanted to study literature when he went to college, but at that time such majors were not available in his region. One had to go to Mexico City. While it did delay having a writing career until the very late 20th century, the author believes it never would have prevented it completely. He believes his origins as a writer began as a reader, and he began reading from a very young age. While he discovered earlier that he liked to tell stories as well as read them, what cemented the idea of becoming a writer was attending a storytelling workshop with writer Agustin Monsreal. Martin credits this teacher, along with Mexican writer Rafael Ramirez Heredia with giving him support in his very early career. While he regularly gives workshops in Mérida, he states that to be a writer one needs three things: to read much, to learn technique and a lot of hard work and talent. Despite a heavy business schedule, he still tried to dedicate a couple of hours per day to writing and reads a couple of books per week. In addition to writing and publishing his own works, he is also involved in the compilation of others’ work, especially writers from the Yucatán Peninsula. He is a member of the Centro Yucateco de Escritores and the editorial board of the Navegaciones Zur literary magazine. Martin’s awards and other recognitions include an honorary mention at the Carmen Baez National Short Story Competition in Morelia (1999), the Beatriz Espejo National Short Story Prize (2003), the Yucatán Autonomous University National Prize (short story category, 2004) and an honorary mention at the San Luis Potosí National Short Story Competition (2008, for Caída Libre). His highest honor so far is the 2012 Max Aub International Short Story Prize (Spain) for Montezuma’s Revenge, which he presented at the Mérida Fest. Two of his publications, Caída Libre and Montezuma’s Revenge were republished by the Reforma newspaper in Mexico City as part of its lists of best books in Mexico for 2010 and 2012. ==Literary style== Martin Briceño specializes in short stories and short novels. Common themes in his work include eroticism, life as part of a couple and the need for humans to have company. In many of his works, his protagonists’ main driving force is to avoid being alone. Influences on his work includes that of Beatriz Espejo, Gonzalo Rojas and John Banville. Authors that he also admires include Thomas Mann, Paul Auster, John Cheever, Hemingway, and Juan Rulfo but considers his style closer to that of Raymond Carver, Enrique Serna and Agustin Monsreal. Author Rafael Ramirez Heredia wrote that Martin is a writer who does not appeal to conscience but rather profiles men and women and their passions, pain, loves and losses, leaning to humanity’s darker side. He does not try to give any spiritual solace to readers, which leads segments of the reading public to reject his work. In fact, some of his own relatives do not come to his literary events because his work is so dark. For example, Montezuma’s Revenge is a bloody and erotic story set in Mérida, Playa del Carmen and Holbox The following work, Montezuma’s Revenge y otras deleites is a story of a Mexican man and foreign woman, studying mostly the dark aspects of Mexicans’ attitudes towards those from other countries. ==Major publications== Martin’s work regularly appears in various types of publications and has been included in more than a dozen national and foreign anthologies. Publications include: *Sureste, antología de cuento contemporáneo de la peninsula de Yucatan (2017, editor and contributor) *La muerte del ruiseñor (2017, first novel) *De la vasta piel (2017, in a personal anthology with publisher Ficticia) *El colibrí (2016, contributor) *Cuentos para leer en navidad (2016, contributor) *Solo cuento VIII (2016, contributor) *Los 43 (2015, contributor) *Montezuma’s Revenge y otros deleites (2014) *Montezuma’s Revenge (2012) *Caída Libre (2010) *Un nudo en la garganta, quince cuentos canallas (2009, contributor) *Estación Central BIS (2009, contributor) *Los mártires del freeway y otras historias (2008) *Prohibido fumar (2008, contributor) *El espejo de Beatriz (2008, contributor) *Al final de la vigilia (2006) *La otredad (2006, contributor) *Litoral de Relámpago (2003, contributor) *Después del aguacero (2000) ==References== Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Mexican writers Category:People from Mérida, Yucatán ","title":"Carlos Martin Briceño"},{"id":"56051571","text":"Lampman is a surname.

It was published subtitled as Published Weekly, Devoted to the Propagation of Phonetic Shorthand, and Phonetic Reading, Writing and Printing. It was printed starting 1841 by Isaac Pitman, and published by F. Pitman at the Phonetic Depot, at 20, Paternoster Row, in London. The journal was initially in 12 small pages plus a 4-page advertising and information wrapper per issue. It published materials in traditional spelling as well as in phonetic spelling, and phonetic shorthand. It also included news of the Phonetic Society and its members. ==The Phonetic Alphabet== The journal promoted The Phonetic Alphabet. It explained the alphabet promoted as \\"consisting of 36 letters, namely the 23 useful letters of the common alphabet (c, q and x being rejected) and 13 new letters included. The vowels a, e, i, o, u were used for their short sound as in pat, pet, pit, pot and put and all the other letters having their usual signification\\". A proposed order of the alphabet was as follows: Consonants: p, b; t, d; ç, j; k, g; f, v; [th], [dh], s, z; ʃ, ʒ; m, n, ŋ; l, r; w, y; h. Vowels: a, ɐ; e, ɛ; i, [ee]; o, [o]; γ, σ; u, ɥ. Diphthongs: ei (as in by), iu (as in new), ou (as in now), ai (as in ay), oi (as in ay). The alphabet also included 9 \\"foreign sounds\\", 7 from French and 2 from German. Further contributions for a proposed alphabet Isaac Pitman, the founder of the journal published Phonotypy in 1844, his major work on spelling reform just three years after the founding of the journal. Pitman and Alexander John Ellis, an English mathematician and philologist jointly proposed in 1845 an English Phonotypic Alphabet made up of 40 letters based mainly on the Phonetic Alphabet of The Phonetic Journal and that of The Phonotypic Journal. Furthermore, in a book edited in 1848, under the title A Plea for Spelling Reform, by Alexander John Ellis, edited by Isaac Pitman, the authors compiled a series of articles from The Phonetic Journal. and from other periodicals, recommending an enlarged alphabet and \\"A Reformed Spelling of the English Language\\" as a \\"means of placing the arts of Reading and Writing within the reach of all who speak the English language or wish acquire it\\", as Pitman said in the intro. ==See also== *English-language spelling reform *English Phonotypic Alphabet ==Notes== *Sample volume of The Phonetic Journal.

The standard was also known as an Euboic standard. Philip II of Macedon adopted Attic standard for his kingdom. Alexander the Great also endorsed the Attic standard during his reign. Macedonian Empire's adoption of the Attic weight brought demise to all other Greek weight standards except for the Rhodian standard. Rhodians had the advantage of having a well-developed commercial sphere in areas such as grain trade with Egypt. During the 300 years of the Hellenistic period the Attic weight underwent several changes. By the time of Alexander the Great, a common trade coin known as a tetradrachm weighted 17.28 grams of silver. In 300 BC the weight of Attic standard stood at slightly reduced weight of 17.20 grams of silver. The Seleucid mint at Antioch shows a continuing process of declining weight. Other mints seem to have followed this decline. All the Diadochi states used Attic standard with the exception of Ptolemaic Egypt. Ptolemaics used the Phoenician standard instead. ==See also== *Attic talent *Seleucid coinage ==References== Category:Coins of ancient Greece Category:Hellenistic period ","title":"Attic weight"},{"id":"56051763","text":"Pink Elephant is a Dutch brand of cigarettes, currently owned and manufactured by Heupink & Bloemen, which also creates the Black Devil brand. ==History== Pink Elephant cigarettes are sold in the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, France, Spain, Switzerland, Poland, Czech Republic and Japan, although they are rather difficult to obtain because they are not sold regularly at gas stations, supermarkets and even specialised tobacco shops.

Previously, he was a commercial farmer near Marondera, Mashonaland East Province. He was also the subject of violent attacks by ZANU–PF war veterans during the land reform program after the 2000 parliamentary elections. Kay was born on Chipesa Farm, his father's estate, in Marondellas, Southern Rhodesia. His father, Jock Kay, was a farmer and politician who served as Deputy Minister of Agriculture of Zimbabwe from 1988 to 1990. During the Rhodesian Bush War, Kay served in the Selous Scouts. After his father's death, Kay took over the management of Chipesa Farm, growing tobacco and maize and raising livestock. In April 2000, around 60 ZANU–PF supporters and Bush War veterans invaded the farm, staking claim to it and violently beating Kay because of his support for the Movement for Democratic Change. He managed to escape alive, but when a police officer came to arrest the occupiers, they shot and killed him, attracting the attention of international media and raising concerns that the land reform program could spark a greater conflict. After the attack, Kay and his family found refuge in Harare, returning to the farm several months later. In July 2001, veterans once again invaded the farm, holding Kay and three neighbors hostage. In March 2002, Kay abandoned Chipesa Farm for good after 53 years of family ownership. In 2005, Kay ran as the Movement for Democratic Change candidate for the Marondera East constituency. In an campaign marked by confrontation by ZANU–PF partisans, Kay earned 35% of the vote, losing to Defence Minister Sydney Sekeramayi, who earned 66%. The election was allegedly influenced by electoral fraud, as the total number of votes was said to have exceeded actual voter turnout. In 2008, Kay ran as the MDC–T candidate for the Marondera Central constituency. He won 66% of the vote against ZANU–PF candidate Peter Murwira, and was seated in the Zimbabwean House of Assembly in 2009. In March 2011, he was seen as a likely candidate to be nominated by his party for the post of Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development, but this ultimately did not materialize. In 2013, Kay lost his seat in Parliament to Ray Kaukonde, the ZANU–PF provincial party chairperson for Mashonaland East. Later that year, the MDC–T gave Kay a five- year suspension from politics after he criticized party leader Morgan Tsvangirai and called for a change in party leadership. Following his removal from active politics, Kay was unemployed and struggling financially. == Early life and education == Kay was born circa 1949 in Marondellas (now Marondera), Southern Rhodesia. He was born and raised on Chipesa Farm, which his father purchased in 1948. His father was Jock Kay, a farmer and ZANU–PF politician who served as Deputy Minister of Agriculture of Zimbabwe from 1988 to 1990. His mother was Peggy Kay. Kay grew up on the farm, where his family's cook, Sydney Tuhna, was a father figure to him. Kay grew up speaking English and Shona and spending hours playing in the bush with Tuhna's children. During the Rhodesian Bush War, Kay served in the Rhodesian Security Forces as a member of the Selous Scouts. == Farming career == After his father's death, Kay took over management of Chipesa Farm, a 5,000-acre estate developed from virgin land in 1948, located 50 miles east of Harare, the capital. On the farm, Kay grew maize and tobacco. The farm supported 500 workers and family members, and included a school, pub, women's center, and a healthcare worker. In 2000, the Kays built a new, thatched-roof house to replace the small cottage that had been there. In addition to commercial farming, Kay engaged in projects intended to improve farming practices among Zimbabwe's rural population. In the 1990s, he began hosting monthly discussion groups in different communities, in which Kay would meet with local farmers to discuss dehorning, disease control, and dipping tank construction. A small fee was charged for attendance which was used to fund different projects. In addition, Kay set aside eight bulls from his herd and loaned one to individual villages for two- year periods to help them improve the gene pool of their stock. A similar program was created with goats. These programs were stopped when the ruling party ZANU–PF's disapproval became evident.  2000–01 farm invasions and aftermath  On 3 April 2000, around 60 ZANU–PF supporters and black Bush War veterans invaded Kay's farm. His property, Chipesa Farm, was among the first to be occupied during the Zimbabwean land reform period following the violent 2000 election. At the start of the invasion, Kay was inside the property's primary school where the farm workers' children attend, where he was taking measurements for an additional classroom. The assailants found him and dragged him outside. The war veterans bound his hands with barbed wire and whipped and beat him for a long time, using sticks, axe handles, and belts. When his captors were distracted by an arriving vehicle, Kay managed to escape and dove into a nearby reservoir. None of his attackers could swim, but they aimed rocks at him through the water. The attack on Chipesa Farm was reported to local police, who sent a young officer to investigate. After he tried to arrest one of the attackers, the officer, 25-year-old Constable Finashe Chikwenaya, was shot dead by the ZANU–PF occupiers. The murder came after three of the occupiers had already been arrested. After the officer was killed, Kay was able to escape the farm with the arrival of his son, David. After the attack, the invaders continued to occupy Chipesa Farm. Kay and his family sought refuge in Harare, and the farm's 120 employees and their 380 dependents were forced away from the farm. The murder of the police constable attracted the attention of the international media, and raised concerns that the farm invasions could spark a larger conflict. After being rescued, Kay spent several days in the Marondera hospital recovering from the beating. After fleeing to Harare, the Kay family spent a few months in the KwaZulu- Natal province of South Africa. While they were away, neighbors prepared the land and planted tobacco seeds for the next harvest. When the veterans tried to stop them, Kay's farmworkers drove them away. After five months, the Kays returned to Zimbabwe, finding their farm abandoned and vandalized. Kay resumed farming, but continued to be harassed by the war veterans. Neighbors reported that the attacks on the farm were because of Kay's support for the Movement for Democratic Change, the main opposition party. On 5 July 2001, 60 war veterans once again occupied Chipesa Farm. The invaders chased away his 120 workers and caused Kay and his son David to lock themselves in the house to remain safe. Chipesa Farm was one of hundreds that were occupied as President Robert Mugabe encouraged war veterans to seize white-owned farms by force. Later that day, two neighboring farmers who had come to help, Kim Nilson and Trevor Steel, also took refuge in the farmhouse. The veterans eventually broke down the doors and began holding the four farmers hostage in the house, threatening to kill them. Police arrived at the scene to deal with the situation. The attack was partially related to Kay's support of opposition political parties and his opposition to ZANU–PF. Three of Kay's workers were beaten badly and taken to the hospital by police. In August 2001, Kay's son came across a rudimentary roadblock of boulders placed on the farm's driveway. One of the rocks had been booby trapped with a primed grenade. Several months later, Kay's adopted son John Rutherford, 34, was attacked on a nearby farm and beaten nearly to death. The ZANU–PF assailants responsible for the attack murdered Rutherford's 29-year-old security guard, Darlington Vhekaveka. In March 2002, the Kay family abandoned Chipesa Farm for good after 53 years, and moved into rented accommodations. == Political career ==  2005 parliamentary election  Kay ran as the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) candidate in the 2005 Zimbabwean parliamentary election. Kay ran against ZANU–PF candidate Sydney Sekeramayi, the Minister of Defence, in Marondera East, a constituency with a history of electoral violence. In the previous 2000 election, the MDC candidate was forced to leave town, his home was torched, and his supporters were allegedly tortured at ZANU–PF headquarters. By 2005, the situation had settled down enough that Kay and the MDC were able to actively campaign. Marondera East is an important district, and one that traditionally votes for ZANU–PF. Kay said he ran for Parliament because \\"it is the right thing to do.\\" Although he was told by some that we was \\"courting trouble\\" by running, he says others came to him and asked him to stand for election. Although there was more openness than the previous election, Kay's opposition campaign still met resistance from ZANU–PF partisans. In early March 2005, the United Methodist church that Kay attended was burned to the ground to scare MDC supporters. Though convinced he had more support than Sekeramayi, he worried that memories of the violence of the 2000 election could harm his prospects. In addition, he was concerned that the increased number of voting stations (90, up from 50 the last election) could be a ploy used by ruling officials to better locate opposition enclaves and target them with retaliation. Ahead of his major campaign rally, Kay had to hold three meetings in caves, to avoid being arrested for breaking the Public Order and Security Act, which restricted freedom of assembly and was used by police to prevent political opposition meetings. And the hundreds of posters put up by his campaign team in the days leading up to the rally were ripped down by ZANU–PF youths. He convinced friends to lend him trucks for the rally, although they feared harassment by party members. Kay's first major campaign rally was held in Marondera on 16 March, two weeks before election day. MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai was present, and 600 supporters attended, listening to speeches and chanting \\"Chinja, chinja!\\" (Change!). Party members were surprised at the large turnout, as turnout of the last MDC rally in 2000 was zero, due to the fear of ZANU–PF violence. Kay, standing next to his wife and sons, spoke to the crowd and chanted along with them. About 50 yards away, 700 people Kay described as \\"swing voters\\" stood, quietly watching. Kay held his rally in a public area so that these swing voters could view the rally. If he had held it in the local stadium, many of these people would not have dared enter to view the rally and associate themselves publicly with the MDC. After the rally, Kay remained at the site to make sure supporters who had been trucked in got home safely and without incident. While Kay's ability to publicly campaign was an improvement for the MDC since 2000, his chances of victory were still dampened by a lingering fear of ZANU–PF. Sekeramayi was a formidable opponent, and ZANU–PF engaged in an extensive door-to-door campaign. On election day, 31 March 2005, Kay, with 10,066 votes, lost to Sekeramayi, with 19,912 votes.Blair, David, \\"Mugabe 'conjures up' winning votes\\", The Daily Telegraph (United Kingdom), 8 April 2005. Sekeramayi's victory was marred by suspected electoral fraud; the total number of votes in the district allegedly exceeded actual voter turnout.  2008 election and Member of Parliament  In the 2008 parliamentary election, Kay ran as the MDC–T candidate for the newly created Marondera Central constituency. He won with 66% of the vote against ZANU–PF candidate Peter Murwira. During the campaign, Kay was the victim of political violence, involving property destruction that he was not compensated for. On 20 May 2008, two months after the election, Kay was arrested, along with several other opposition politicians, for allegedly inciting public violence.\\"Zim opposition lawmakers arrested\\", Sapa-AFP (IOL), 21 May 2008. He applied for a discharge in early June before a Marondera magistrate. In March 2011, Kay was put forward by his party as the likely nominee for the post of Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development. Roy Bennett, the previous presumptive nominee, was taken out of consideration due to his self-imposed exile in South Africa and his impending expulsion from the Senate. Kay was then chosen as the best candidate because of his past experience in agriculture as a commercial farmer. Ultimately, Kay was never took office as deputy minister.  2013 election and suspension from party  In the 2013 election, Kay, the MDC–T incumbent, ran against ZANU–PF candidate Ray Kaukonde, the party's provincial chairperson for Mashonaland East Province. In the year prior to the election, Kay was subjected to accusations spread by ZANU–PF campaigners who alleged that Kay committed atrocities while a member of the Selous Scouts during the Rhodesian Bush War. Local ZANU–PF officials filmed a dramatized propaganda documentary, which was broadcast on Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation. Ultimately, Kay lost to Kaukonde by a margin of 52% of the vote to Kay's 44%. In 2013, Kay was punished with a five-year suspension from the MDC–T after he called for leadership change and described party leader Morgan Tsvangirai as a rusty bolt in need of replacement. Following a hearing, Kay was given the suspension by the party's provincial chair for Mashonaland East. Following his removal from active politics, Kay faced financial struggles and unemployment. == Personal life == Kay and his wife Kerry have three adult sons, David, Bruce, and Clive. They have an adopted adult son, John Rutherford, and an adopted daughter, Lindsay, whose parents died in a plane crash in 2000.

Their high- intensity light can be used to shrink or destroy tumors or precancerous growths. Lasers are most commonly used to treat superficial cancers (cancers on the surface of the body or the lining of internal organs) such as basal- cell skin cancer and the very early stages of some cancers, such as cervical, penile, vaginal, vulvar, and non-small cell lung cancer. Ordinary light consists of many wavelengths and spreads in all directions. Laser light, on the other hand, has a specific wavelength and can be collimated to produce a narrow beam with very high intensity. Because lasers can focus very accurately on tiny areas, they can be used for very precise surgical work or for cutting through tissue (in place of a scalpel). Three types of lasers are used to treat cancer: carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers, argon lasers, and neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) lasers. == Treatment strategies == Lasers also may be used to relieve certain symptoms of cancer, such as bleeding or obstruction. For example, lasers can be used to shrink or destroy a tumor that is blocking a patient’s trachea (windpipe) or esophagus. Lasers also can be used to remove colon polyps or tumors that are blocking the colon or stomach. Laser therapy can be used alone, but most often it is combined with other treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. In addition, lasers can seal nerve endings to reduce pain after surgery and seal lymph vessels to reduce swelling and limit the spread of tumor cells. Three types of lasers are used to treat cancer: carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers, argon lasers, and neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) lasers. Laser therapy is often given through a flexible endoscope (a thin, lighted tube used to look at tissues inside the body). The endoscope is fitted with optical fibers (thin fibers that transmit light). It is inserted through an opening in the body, such as the mouth, nose, anus, or vagina. Laser light is then precisely aimed to cut or destroy a tumor. Laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT), or interstitial laser photocoagulation, also uses lasers to treat some cancers. LITT is similar to a cancer treatment called hyperthermia, which uses heat to shrink tumors by damaging or killing cancer cells. During LITT, an optical fiber is inserted into a tumor. Laser light at the tip of the fiber raises the temperature of the tumor cells and damages or destroys them. LITT is sometimes used to shrink tumors in the liver. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is another type of cancer treatment that uses lasers. In PDT, a certain drug, called a photosensitizer or photosensitizing agent, is injected into a patient and absorbed by cells all over the patient’s body. After a couple of days, this agent is found mostly in cancer cells. Laser light is then used to activate the agent and destroy cancer cells. Because the photosensitizer makes the skin and eyes sensitive to light afterwards, patients are advised to avoid direct sunlight and bright indoor light during that time. CO2 and argon lasers can cut the skin’s surface without going into deeper layers. Thus, they can be used to remove superficial cancers, such as skin cancer. In contrast, the Nd:YAG laser is more commonly applied through an endoscope to treat internal organs, such as the uterus, esophagus, and colon. Nd:YAG laser light can also travel through optical fibers into specific areas of the body during LITT. Argon lasers are often used to activate the drugs used in PDT. CO2 lasers can also be used to debulk and resect tumors. == Advantages and limitations == Lasers are more precise than standard surgical tools (scalpels), so they do less damage to normal tissues. As a result, patients usually have less pain, bleeding, swelling, and scarring. With laser therapy, operations are usually shorter. In fact, laser therapy can often be done on an outpatient basis. It takes less time for patients to heal after laser surgery, and they are less likely to get infections. Laser therapy also has several limitations. Surgeons must have specialized training before they can do laser therapy, and strict safety precautions must be followed. Laser therapy is expensive and requires bulky equipment. In addition, the effects of laser therapy may not last long, so doctors may have to repeat the treatment for a patient to get the full benefit. Lasers also may be used to relieve certain symptoms of cancer, such as bleeding or obstruction. For example, lasers can be used to shrink or destroy a tumor that is blocking a patient’s trachea (windpipe) or esophagus. Lasers also can be used to remove colon polyps or tumors that are blocking the colon or stomach. Laser therapy is more expensive than other treatments. Physicians have to have special training to perform procedures using laser therapy. The equipment is bulky. Laser therapy can be used alone, but most often it is combined with other treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. In addition, lasers can seal nerve endings to reduce pain after surgery and seal lymph vessels to reduce swelling and limit the spread of tumor cells.

It was built in 1965 as the Northwestern Bank Building and was later called the BB&T; Building. In 2019, it reopened as the Art Deco style Kimpton Hotel and condominium complex after a major renovation. The building is 228 feet tall. ==History== Office tower Zebulon Vance Monument in 2011 with Northwestern/BB&T; Building in background Groundbreaking took place in February 1964, with hundreds of people witnessing the start of one of the city's few major projects since the Great Depression. The Northwestern Bank Building opened October 23, 1965 as the state's tallest building west of Charlotte. A newspaper account referred to the \\"anodized aluminum curtain wall\\" and called it \\"unique and aesthetically pleasing\\", and the building was considered a \\"construction milestone.\\" Built like many skyscrapers of the time, the Northwestern Bank Building resembled the Seagram Building in New York City and IBM Plaza in Chicago, both designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. A 2017 Asheville Citizen-Times article said \\"the opening of such a modern, imposing edifice was a source of pride for many in Asheville.\\" On the other hand, an entire block had to be torn down, including the eight- story Langren Hotel built in 1912 and five other buildings. Glenn Wilcox Sr.'s Wilcox Travel and World Tours was an original tenant and remained in the building for 51 years. The City Club occupied the 16th floor. When First Union Corp. took over Northwestern Financial Corp. in 1985, Northwestern had to sell some of its branches. Branch Banking & Trust Co. (BB&T;) bought the Asheville branch and branches in Maggie Valley, Fletcher and Old Fort.Steve Matthews, \\"3 N.C. Banks Agree to Buy 12 Branches,\\" The Charlotte Observer, October 12, 1985. By this time, according to a 2012 report on the city's architectural inventory, the building was considered \\"a substantial eyesore\\" and it was eventually referred to as \\"Big Brown & Tall\\". With significant problems such as leaks and heating system failure, it was considered \\"a symbol of Asheville's declining fortunes.\\" BB&T; located its regional office in the tower in September 1988 and the building's name changed to the BB&T; Building. Asheville Building Associates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and in November 1988 Wilcox and two partners bought the building for $6.8 million. Occupancy was at 70 percent as the former owners had done little to keep the building in good shape. The new owners formed Tower Associates and made renovations inside, but the exterior would have cost too much to update. Many considered the modern building to be out of place in Asheville, especially since it was so large. Still, occupancy increased to over 90 percent. Hotel On April 28, 2015, McKibbon Hotel Group chairman John McKibbon announced plans for an \\"upper-upscale\\" hotel called Vandre Hotel using six floors, with the building being renamed Nouveau Tower when the project was complete in 2017. The hotel would be McKibbon's fifth in Asheville. As of 2016, the renovation plan included a complete change in the exterior using steel, glass and synthetic stone, and elements of Art Deco that would help the building match other buildings downtown. The former office building would have 140 hotel rooms and 39 condominiums, also adding 35,300 square feet of parking. Glenn Wilcox and John McKibbon were partners in the project. The Asheville City Council approved the necessary rezoning January 12, 2016. In September 2016, John McKibbon announced plans for a 128-room boutique hotel to be called The Arras, with two restaurants and 54 condominiums.

Under the original agreement with Fiat, the car could not be sold in competition with the 124 until its replacement (the Fiat 131 Mirafiori) had been released and all Fiat production of the 124 had ceased. Lada cars became popular in Russia and Eastern Europe during the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in former Eastern bloc countries. Lada made its name in Western Europe selling large volumes of the VAZ-2101 and its many derivatives as an economy car during the 1980s.

Over 60% of production was exported, mainly to Western countries (the US was the only large market not to have imported Ladas). Economic instability in the former Soviet Union in the 1990s, tightening emissions and safety legislation meant that AvtoVAZ withdrew from most Western markets by the late 1997. In later years, Lada is again exported. The Lada is marketed in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and within the European Union, it has been made available in the Czech Republic, Romania , Slovakia, Austria, France, Germany, Hungary, and Egypt. ==Americas==  Brazil  Ladas arrived in Brazil in 1990, when Brazilian president Fernando Collor lifted the ban on car imports. Lada was the first car maker to enter the Brazilian car market as an official importer, grey importers having already brought in other brands soon after the importation re-opening. Initially, the Lada 2105 (sedan) and 2104 (station wagon) models (badged as the \\"Lada Laika\\") and the \\"Lada Niva\\" were successful, mostly among taxi drivers, because of their low prices and functionality. Between 1990 and 1992, Lada sold more cars than any other importer to Brazil. Following their arrival, Lada cars were regarded by consumers and local specialized media, as outdated and inefficient but their commercial success was due to the Lada's publicity campaign which gave their cars an image of imported vehicle affordable for almost everyone, combined with consumer curiosity for imported products, a novelty at the time. Shortly thereafter the Samara was introduced, but did not enjoy the same success. The Laika model's popularity began to wane after a few years. However, the Niva continued to be strong in the off-road market, even having a limited edition exclusively for Brazil (Niva Pantanal). It continued to be sold until 1997. Many of the last Lada Nivas sold in Brazil had diesel engines. Most of the Nivas sold in Brazil remain operational and used cars command high prices. A 1991 Niva in very good condition can cost as much as R$11,000 or US$5,500, far more than the average price for a car of that year. The normal price for a Lada Niva made in year 1991 or 1992 is around R$6,000 or US$3,000 on the Brazilian used car market. As many as 30,000 Lada cars were sold in Brazil between 1990 and 1997. Despite the Lada Niva having a considerable fanbase among Brazilian off-road enthusiasts, both the Lada Laika and the Lada Samara were never well-accepted in the Brazilian used car market since Lada's importation shutdown in 1997, mostly due to the issues reported above, but also due to the lack of spare parts and dealer support. Most of the Samaras were already dismantled or are abandoned, no longer running. It is not unusual to see those remaining exemplars being given for free or sold for very cheap prices. The few remaining Laikas, Nivas, and Samaras in Brazil, are using adapted spare parts from other models and makers.  Canada  LadaCanada started importing in 1979. The first model was the Lada 2106, with a 1500 cc engine. Later, the Lada Niva, a 1.6L 4x4 Lada, did very well, with over 12,000 sold the first year. In the mid-1990s Lada were selling around 12,000 cars per year in Canada. Lada disappeared from Canada after the 1998 model year, replaced by low-cost South Korean automakers. By the late 2000s decade, many Lada dealerships had disappeared. A few Ladas still circulate.  Chile  Ladas had been sold in Chile for some time when a catalytic converter requirement was gradually introduced there beginning in 1987. Lada used a Swiss manufacturer of emissions equipment and sold cars thus equipped for a few years. It was later shown that the equipment did not meet the requirement, but Chile did not have the requisite technology to verify manufacturer claims on their own. Lada ended up withdrawing from Chilean market before the end of the nineties.  Colombia In Colombia, the Lada brand has been seen since the late 1970s. After the beginning of the decade, under the presidency of Misael Pastrana Borrero, with diplomatic relations between Colombia and the Soviet Union being principally economic, local products were exported in exchange for importing products from the USSR including cars such as the Lada brand. This lasted from the middle to later portion of the decade. Currently, a Colombian website has information and photographs about all Lada vehicles manufactured by AvtoVAZ. The models were usually from the late 1970s to the early 1980s particularly Niva 4x2 and 4x4. In the 1990s, the 2110/2112 models in their familiar and sedan versions became available as well as the Samara (3 and 5 doors versions) plus a limited number of the sedan version. Then, a local assembler, known as AutoTAT, using technology from the Niva introduced to the Colombian market Niva models under the brand Bronto as the Landole and Fora models, which differ from the original model in its motorization (since they are said to use systems Sequential electronic injection), as well as in their measurements; Being these up to 30 cm longer than the Niva model. Nowadays, only vehicles from the old Kia plant in Ecuador, the local factory AYMESA, that arrive like Lada, are already seen in the country, using already a motorization and electronics according to the present times, until 2006, when the importation for this model was ceased for his low demand and a high competence from other vehicle manufacturers from Japan and China.  Costa Rica  Lada cars arrived in Costa Rica in the late seventies and became popular in the eighties as one of the few new cars that the middle class could afford. The models included the Niva, 2104 and Samara. A few Ladas still circulate.  Cuba  Lada cars appeared in Cuba in the mid-1970s. They became popular in the '80s and by the end of this decade represented more than 30% of the cars used in the country. The Lada 2101 is used by the police and as taxis.  Ecuador  Lada 112 \\"Sport\\" in Ecuador Lada entered Ecuador during the 1970s. Imports stopped in the mid-1990s. In 1999 AvtoVAZ associated with the local factory AYMESA to produce the Lada Niva 4x4 1.7i. In 2000, the first units appeared on the market. This agreement ended in 2004 when imports resumed. By 2007 other car models were being imported: the Lada 110, Lada 111, Lada 112, Lada Kalina (sedan), Lada Niva 2121 (3-doors), Lada Niva 2131 (5-doors) and the Lada 2107 nicknamed \\"Clasico\\" (Classic). During 2008 imports of most models decreased or, in some cases, stopped. Only the Niva 2121 and Niva 2131 continued to be imported in 2009. As of 2010, imports stopped again. However, the importation of spare parts continued. Few old models, such as the Lada 2101, still function.  Jamaica  An agreement between Jamaica and the USSR in the early 1980s brought Ladas in under a barter arrangement in exchange for bauxite ore. Ladas became popular as taxis, replacing the dated Morris Oxford.  Trinidad and Tobago  From 1995 until 2001, Lada Riva sedans, estates, Nivas and Samaras found a market in Trinidad and Tobago. Using right hand drive kits from the defunct Lada UK, these were sold as budget transportation. At one time the Riva 1.5 SE sedan was the cheapest new car available. Trinidadian dealer Petrogas Ltd. marketed the Riva as a family runabout and the Niva as a lifestyle 4x4. They retailed for between US$8,000.00-$15,000.00. Increasing competition from grey market Japanese models soon forced Ladas out. The Samara was introduced in 2000 as a last- ditch attempt to salvage the brand. It failed and the last Samaras were sold as unfinished kits in 2003. ==Asia-Pacific==  Australia  Ladas were first imported into Australia in 1984 with the Niva compact 4WD and in 1988 the Samara three-door hatchback was introduced. The Samara five-door hatchback and four-door sedan later joined the Samara three-door hatch, but under different names—the five-door hatchback was called the \\"Cevaro\\" and the four- door sedan was sold as the \\"Sable\\". The Lada Niva 4WD was offered as a pickup truck on an extended wheelbase and with a two-door soft top. In 1988, approximately 6,000 Lada Samaras were modified by Peter Brock's special vehicles operation that had previously made high performance Holden Commodores. The cars would be known as the \\"Lada Samara Sedan Brock Delux\\" and included a few subtle Brock-devised suspension tweaks to improve the car's low speed ride. It cost about A$3,000 more than the base model Samara. While initial sales were promising, by 1996 sales had crashed to under 100 units. Ladas were imported into Australia after 1994, but it took two years to sell the remaining stock. The Lada Niva enjoys a small cult following in Australia; it is the Lada model most often seen on Australian roads.  New Zealand  Ladas were briefly popular in New Zealand in the 1980s. Meat, dairy and fertiliser exports to Russia were wholly or partly paid for with Belarus tractors, Stolichnaya vodka and Lada cars. The New Zealand Dairy Board were distributors for Lada vehicles.New Zealand and the Soviet Union, 1950-1991: A Brittle Relationship, April 1, 2005 . Retrieved June 22, 2010. Some Ladas, even those of the 1970s, can still be seen on New Zealand roads (especially in rural areas and offshore islands) but are increasingly rare.  Singapore  The Samara, Riva and Niva were introduced in Singapore for a brief period in the early 1990s. They proved impractical in a country where cars over three years of age must be inspected yearly. The Certificate of Entitlement system required drivers paying a hefty sum after 10 years to continue driving their cars. Lada quickly left. Few, if any, Lada cars remain on Singapore roads. ==Europe==  Finland  Lada cars came to Finland in 1971. Lada became the car for the everyman in Finland. It was cheap, reasonably reliable, easy to fix, tune and rig. Ladas were among the popular cars for many years in the 1970s but their share declined. In 2004 Lada was in 26th position. Delta-Auto stopped importing Lada to Finland in 2009. Samaras were assembled at Valmet during the 1990s specifically for the European market, known as the \\"Euro- Samara\\". In 2016 an entrepreneur started importing new Lada models to Finland again. As of 2020 only two Niva 4x4 models are on the price list. Germany Until 1999 Lada was imported through a number of official importers: Eurolada, Samara GmbH and Deutsche Lada. After they ceased to exist, LADA Automobile GmbH Deutschland in Buxtehude took over and imported the Niva with some success, but also Kalina, Vesta or Granta have been sold at some point. In 2019 only the Vesta and the 4x4 (ex-Niva) are sold. Plans are to stop the official import until 2022 due to too strict emission standards. Despite the normal Lada Range (except Niva II and Largus) also cars from other Brands have been sold through the Importer in the 90s: Moskvitch 2141 (as Lada Aleko) and also ZAZ Tavria (as Lada Tavria) Italy Sales to Italy were forbidden by the agreement between the Soviet government and Fiat, to protect Fiat from cheap imports in its home market.  Portugal  AvtoVAZ began exporting cars to Portugal in 1986. In April 2002, Lada exited the car market.  Iceland  Lada cars were imported to Iceland over some period of time and were popular for several reasons, a few of those were their good DIY features, fitting well to the cold climate, and handling the road conditions of the country. The import of Russian cars started in 1954 with 100 units of Pobeda, then followed the Moskvich, Volga and finally Lada.https://www.fib.is/is/um-fib/frettir/nyir-lada-sport-a-islandi  Sweden  \\"Lada\\" means barn in Swedish and was imported to Sweden during the 1970s and 1980s for the USSR (Soviet Union) to earn foreign currency. The early classic Lada version of the Fiat 124 was featured with Russian dashboard. The Niva SUV developed a cult following for its robust and inexpensive DIY features. The Lada Samara introduced in 1986 sold less. After the USSR collapsed, Asian brands, as well as the newly reintroduced Skoda, forced Lada out of the market in the late 1990s and the importer ceased its operations in 1999. Grey market imports continued, mainly the Niva . Lada Sweden was officially reopened in 2010 by one of the grey market importers. During the 1990s an ad for Samara was prominently displayed for several years at Stockholm Central Station.  United Kingdom and Ireland  AvtoVAZ began exporting to the UK in 1974 and Ireland in 1983 as Lada. After introduction of the Riva range to the UK in 1983, with UK and Ireland sales peaking in 1988 at 33,000 units (nearly 2% of UK car sales). A memorable advert for the Riva was produced featuring comedy duo Cannon & Ball. AvtoVAZ built up a network of UK and Ireland Lada dealers through its marketing associate, Satra Motors. The Satra-owned dealerships were all sold off in 1987 and 1988. The Lada Riva & Niva were the first models to be imported into Ireland. They were followed by the Samara in 1987 which sold in very low numbers. Lada pulled out of the Irish market in the early 1990s. Lada was a victim of the political and economic problems of Russia in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was not possible to invest adequately. By the 1990s the Riva design was archaic, dating back to 1966. Not even prices starting below £5,000 were enough to disguise its vintage design. By 1994, annual sales of the Lada range had fallen to just over 9,000 - less than a third of the peak figures attained six years earlier. United Kingdom and Ireland sales dwindled to barely 8,000 units in 1996, the last full year in which Lada cars were marketed. By this stage, many Lada dealers either went out of business or switched brands - many Lada franchisees went on to sell Proton or Hyundai vehicles. Confronted with the need to meet 1992 EU emission control requirements, Lada tried to continue to use a carburator with an exhaust catalyst instead of electronic fuel injection. Three years later at their first emissions MOT test they failed very badly: over-fuelling had destroyed the catalysts. This failure, along with a shortage of certain imported components and increased competition from Daewoo and Proton in the 1990s, led AvtoVAZ to withdraw from most Western European markets. In 1979, Lada produced the Niva four-wheel drive. It had monocoque construction, which was innovative in the 4x4 market where a heavy separate chassis was the norm. It competed well with Japanese rivals such as the Suzuki SJ/Samurai and Daihatsu Fourtrak in practicality and stability and its off-road ability. The Niva was significantly cheaper than its rivals. This was one area where Lada achieved some market success in the 1990s. The Niva was adopted by several British police forces and attracted something of a cult following with 4x4 enthusiasts. The Niva could have benefited from a diesel option, but it was never offered. Lada 1600 The Samara was launched in the UK in November 1987. The decision to withdraw from the UK was announced on 4 July 1997. More than 100,000 of the 350,000 or so Lada cars sold in Britain were still on the road, with more than 1,000 still in stock. Just over 5,000 Lada cars were sold in Britain during 1997. After Lada withdrew in 1997, several dealers continued to import Nivas. These required some local modification of the new General Motors-supplied engines to meet emission control standards. The 2110 was never sold in the UK or Ireland. After Lada (UK) ceased operations in 1997, the remains of the British network of Lada dealers were serviced by Lada (France). Ladas rapidly disappeared from British roads. They had minimal second-hand value in the UK and a re-export market for Russia moved many UK- and Irish-registered Ladas back to Russia (especially by Russian trawlermen), to be stripped for spare parts or to be sold to Russian buyers. They appreciated the export cars built to better specification than the local versions. Many Ladas returned to Russia by ship through Latvia and Lithuania where enterprising mechanics switched the right hand drive to the left side for about USD 500-600 and then shipped them back to Russia for second-hand resale. Several attempts were made to reintroduce Ladas to the UK. In May 2010, the Niva (a design now more than 30 years old) became available again, through an independent importer. Aimed at the agricultural market, three models are available (all LHD), the three-door four-seat hatchback at £10,000, a two-seat commercial van, £8000 and a two-door, four-seat pickup for £12,000. All meet UK Vehicle Certification Agency standards. Engine options are restricted to a 1.7 litre petrol engine, with or without LPG conversion. ==Middle East and Northern Africa==  Egypt  Both the Riva and Niva are popular amongst the Egyptian working-class. The Riva sedan serves as one of Egypt's most popular taxis and is a fixture in virtually every city.  Turkey  Lada entered the Turkish market in the late-1980s. Most sales were of Samaras (100,000 units). The Niva made an impact in the 4x4 market. New models like Lada 2110 are still sold in Turkey, with less success. == References == Category:AvtoVAZ Category:Foreign trade of the Soviet Union ","title":"AvtoVAZ vehicles in international markets"},{"id":"56052426","text":"The 2017–18 St. Bonaventure Bonnies women's basketball team represents the St. Bonaventure University during the 2017–18 NCAA Division I women's basketball season.

The goal of the project was to produce a controlled fusion reaction by compressing plasma inside metal liners. The basic concept is today known as magnetized target fusion. The reactor design was based on the mechanical compression of magnetic flux (and therefore plasma) inside a molten metal liner. A chamber was filled with molten metal and rotated along one axis. This spinning motion created a cylindrical cavity into which plasma was injected. Once the plasma was contained within the cavity, the liquid metal wall was rapidly compressed, which would raise the temperature and density of the trapped plasma to fusion conditions. The use of a liquid metal liner has many of the advantages over previous experiments that imploded cylindrical metal liners to achieve high- energy-density fusion. The liquid metal liner provided the benefits of recovering the heat energy of the reaction, absorbing neutrons, transferring kinetic energy, and replacing the plasma-facing wall during each cycle. Additional benefits of a liquid liner include greatly simplified servicing of the reactor, reducing radioactivity, and protecting the permanent sections of the reactor from neutron damage. The danger from flying shrapnel was also mitigated with the use of liquid liners. The concept was revived in the 2000s as the basis for the General Fusion design, currently being built in Canada. == Conceptual design == In the LINUS concept, plasma is injected into a molten lead-lithium liner. The liner is then imploded mechanically, using high pressure helium pistons. The imploding liner acts to compress the magnetically-confined plasma adiabatically to fusion temperature and relatively high density (). In the subsequent expansion the plasma energy and the fusion energy carried by trapped alpha particles is directly recovered by the liquid metal, making the mechanical cycle self-sustaining. The implosion cycle would be repeated every few seconds. The LINUS reactor can thus be regarded as a fusion engine, except that there is no shaft output; all the energy appears as heat. The liquid metal acts as both a compression mechanism and heat transfer mechanism, allowing the energy from the fusion reaction to be captured as heat. LINUS researchers anticipated that a lithium liner could also be used to breed tritium fuel for the power plant, and would protect the machine from high-energy neutrons by acting as a regenerative first wall. == Experiments == Several experimental machines were constructed throughout the LINUS project, to gather data and demonstrate various aspects of the system concept.  SUZY II  To obtain detailed information about the behavior of the inner surface of solid and liquid metal liners during the final moments of an implosion, and experiment called SUZY II was built at NRL. The experiment was used to compress various metal liners from an initial diameter of to a final diameter of about using magnetic fields. An overall compression ratio of 28:1 was achieved. One goal of SUZY II was to demonstrate the use of electromagnetic driving techniques to achieve liner implosions. The central feature of SUZY II was a bank of capacitors charged to , which was able to quickly deliver of energy to be used for generating large magnetic fields. Pressures greater than were achieved during the implosions. SUZY II was named after its predecessor, SUZY I, a capacitor bank.  LINUS-0  To study the hydrodynamic behavior and magnetic flux compression at the target energy density regimes, a device called LINUS-0 was constructed in 1978. The experiment involved a rotating cylindrical chamber filled with molten metal or water. A large number of pistons (16 or 32) were attached to the chamber, and were in contact with the rotating liquid. During the experiment, all pistons were simultaneously propelled to drive the liquid radially inward. The pistons in the LINUS-0 experiment were driven by the high-explosive agent DATB (), also known as PBXN, chosen for its high melting point, low particulate matter, and compatibly low cost. The experimental parameters for LINUS-0 required the cylindrical chamber to rotate at , which was accomplished with a 454 Chevrolet V8 engine. All pistons were required to fire within of each other. During data collection, LINUS-0 was fired as often as three times per day.  HELIUS  A similar machine, called HELIUS, was constructed to demonstrate magnetic flux compression. HELIUS was a half-scale version of LINUS-0, and was designed to use liquid sodium and potassium in the liner chamber. In practice, the use of water was sufficient for the hydrodynamic studies. In the HELIUS experiment, the liquid sodium-potassium liners were imploded using high-pressure Helium () to drive mechanical pistons. == Fate of project == Experiments on LINUS-0 and HELIUS were largely unsuccessful due in part to delays incurred in the design, fabrication, and assembly phases. Time wasn't allocated to recover from delays or unexpected challenges, and the machines were eventually disassembled and placed in storage. The LINUS project encountered several engineering problems which limited its performance and therefore its attractiveness as an approach to commercial fusion power. These issues included performance of the plasma preparation and injection technique, the ability to achieve reversible compression/expansion cycles, and problems with magnetic flux diffusion into the liner material. Also, the ability to remove the vaporized liner material from the cavity between cycles (within a duration of about ) was not accomplished. There were also shortcomings with the design of the inner mechanism which pumped the liquid-metal liner. One major problem that LINUS encountered was related to hydrodynamic instabilities in the liquid liner. If the liquid wasn't properly compressed, it could result in instabilities in the plasma called RT instabilities. This condition could destroy the fusion reaction by injecting liner material (vaporized lead and lithium) into the plasma. This problem diminished the efficiency of the fusion reactions, and could even cause damage to the reactor. Synchronizing the timing of the compression system was not possible with the technology of the time, and the proposed design was canceled. ==See also== * Electromagnetic forming * General Fusion * Magnetized target fusion * Shiva Star == References == Category:Nuclear power Category:Magnetic confinement fusion devices ","title":"LINUS (fusion experiment)"},{"id":"56052553","text":"The Billboard Latin Music Award for Hot Latin Songs Artist of the Year (formerly Hot Latin Tracks Artist of the Year) is an honor presented annually at the Billboard Latin Music Awards, a ceremony which honors \\"the most popular albums, songs, and performers in Latin music, as determined by the actual sales, radio airplay, streaming and social data that informs Billboards weekly charts.\\" The award is given to best performing artists on Billboards Hot Latin Songs chart, which measures the most popular Latin songs in the United States.

The tour was set to help Johnson promote his 7th studio album, All the Light Above It Too. On February 9, 2017, the tour was announced with the release of Johnson's song \\"Fragments\\", from the film \\"The Smog of the Sea.\\" The tour's first date was for him to perform at Huntington Bank Pavilion on June 1, 2017. Johnson then announced more tour dates on July 14, 2017 along with the lead single of the album, \\"My Mind Is for Sale.\\" The South American leg of the tour was later announced when Johnson released his third single from the album, \\"You Can't Control It.\\" The day before the album was released on September 7, 2017, Johnson announced the Australian Leg of the tour. On December 10, 2017, the European leg of the tour was announced, along with more US dates due to demand. The tour ended on November 10, 2019 with his show in Costa Rica. == Opening acts == * Bahamas * Animal Liberation Orchestra * Lake Street Dive * G. Love & Special Sauce * John Craigie * Fruition * Milow * DJ Nate == Background == The original tour started on June 1, 2017, which was the original time that Johnson and Brushfire Records planned to release the album. But due to a surfing trip attended by Johnson, the album release date had to be moved to September 2017. For Johnson's 2017 summer shows, the average gross was $758,437, and ranked at number 30 on the top concert tours of the summer. To date, the tour has sold 99.5% of all the tickets available, making it a huge success. On March 18, 2018, Johnson performed again at Santa Barbara Bowl with other special guests. 100% of the proceeds went to United Way Worldwide to help support families from the 2017 California wildfires. The show at Santa Barbara Bowl raised more than $500,000 for United Way. \\"I hope everyone enjoyed the event as much as my band, crew, and I did,\\" Johnson said. \\"The process of working together with so many friends to support our community ended up being healing in itself. We are so grateful to everyone who helped make the evening possible.\\" The projected goal for the concert was $200,000. Johnson also helped United Way by helping out the community during the days before the concert. He also performed in Hawaii on May 12, 2018 to raise money for Kau'i Relif and recovery fund. Johnson will also be performing at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival on May 6, 2018 along with artists such as Aretha Franklin and Sheryl Crow. On June 15, he continued by playing at Mountain Jam 2018. == Commercial reception ==  Ticket sales and Boxscore  According Billboard Boxscore reports, the tour grossed a total of $109.4 million. During the 2017 legs of the tour, Pollstar reported that 403,814 tickets were sold for a gross of $22.9 million. This made Johnson's tour the 90th best selling tour of 2017. The average ticket price from the 2017 legs was a low $56.71, and the average show gross was $693,939. == Setlist == The following setlist was obtained the concert held on August 28, 2018; at Ak-Chin Pavilion in Phoenix, Arizona.

As of July 2019, the organization has acquired and freely published more than twenty five million records, most of which had never been open to the public before in any location or format, or else were only available in very outdated formats such as microfiche in limited locations but had never gone online before. ==History== Reclaim The Records was founded by Brooke Schreier Ganz, a technologist and long-time amateur genealogist. While living in California, Ganz had become increasingly frustrated by the lack of online access to New York City and New York State archival records. Almost none of the New York records had been put online by their respective city or state government archives or agencies, nor were the records available to search or to view through any genealogy websites, whether for-profit or non-profit. A small subset of the basic vital records index data was available to the public, but only if one was physically onsite in New York records repositories, and only in outdated formats such as microfilm and microfiche. After unsuccessfully attempting to use New York City's open data law, Local Law 11 of 2012, to compel the publication of the basic indices to these records, Ganz decided to use the state's Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) to force the release of copies. She made a FOIL request of the New York City Municipal Archives in January 2015, which was initially agreed to and then denied by the city. This led to an Article 78 lawsuit in the Supreme Court of New York that August. Not wanting to sue the city with just her name on the case, Ganz created Reclaim The Records as an organization so that they could both be listed as Petitioner on the case. The city settled the case five days before they were due in court, and Ganz won the first public copies of the index to New York City marriage licenses for 1908-1929 on 48 rolls of microfilm. This was the first time that an American genealogist had ever successfully sued for the return of genealogical records to the public.We Don't Always Lose, The Legal Genealogist (Judy G.

In January 2016, Reclaim The Records filed another FOIL request that became another Article 78 lawsuit, this time filed against the New York City Clerk's Office. They too settled with the group, providing 110 reels of microfilm and copies of a digital database they had created for in-house use. The city also paid the organization's attorneys fees. In November 2016, Reclaim The Records filed a third lawsuit under the Missouri Sunshine Law against the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services for access to the basic index to births and deaths in the state. During the course of the lawsuit, it was discovered that the Missouri DHSS had been selling this same data to researchers for years, but was unwilling to provide copies to the public. The case is still pending. Reclaim The Records was formally incorporated in December 2016 and was granted 501(c)(3) non-profit status by the IRS in February 2017. ==Notable legal cases== {  - ! style=\\"white-space: nowrap;\\"  Name of record set !!

The house was built sometime between 1784 and 1785, and historical records suggest that it was designed by its owner John Penn, grandson of William Penn, the founder of the city of Philadelphia and the state of Pennsylvania. The mansion is also referred to as The Solitude and The Solitude House, as well as the John Penn House and simply Solitude without the definite article. The name of the house was inspired by the Duke of Württemberg's much larger Castle Solitude outside Stuttgart, Germany. The Solitude is the only extant home of a Penn family member in the United States. Located in the countryside several miles to the northwest of colonial-era Philadelphia, Penn's house served as his refuge from an older cousin's city home, where he had been lodging, as well as from an anti-Penn political faction in town. Penn lived in his new home for about three years until he left the country permanently in 1788 and sailed to England. After Penn died in 1834, the house was inherited in succession by three other family members—Penn's brother and then two nephews separately. At some time after the final Penn owner died in 1869, the city bought the property and leased it to the Zoological Society of Philadelphia in 1874. The land and house then became part of the Philadelphia Zoo, which in turn is a part of Fairmount Park. The house is not open to general admission visitors, but rather only for special events. Rental information is available from the zoo.\\"Zoo map\\" (archive). philadelphiazoo.org. Philadelphia Zoo. Retrieved December 14, 2017. \\"Additional venues: The Solitude For special events only.

The Códice Casanatense, its popular Portuguese title, or the Codex Casanatense 1889, is a set of 16th century Portuguese illustrations, which depict peoples and cultures whom the Portuguese frequently had contact with around the Indian and Pacific oceans. It is now kept at the Biblioteca Casanatense in Rome, with the official designation of Album di disegni, illustranti usi e costumi dei popoli d'Asia e d'Africa con brevi dichiarazioni in lingua portoghese (\\"Album of drawings, illustrating the uses and customs of the people of Asia and Africa with a brief description in Portuguese language\\"). ==Contents and origin== The codex consists of seventy-six watercolour illustrations, one of which is a later addition. Most come with a short description, and include illustrations of people from east Africa, Arabia, Persia, Afghanistan, India, Ceylon, Malaysia, China and the Moluccas, as well as some insights into fauna, flora and certain traditions, such as the Hindu religion - previously unknown in Europe. The creator has not been identified and many hypotheses have proven inconclusive. Several of its inscriptions provide information as to the date it was made, namely the allusion to the Siege of Diu of 1538, but the absence of any mention of the Japanese, whom the Portuguese contacted in 1541-43. It is therefore possible it was made circa 1540. Its earliest recorded owner was the novice João da Costa of the College of St. Paul of Goa, who in 1627 sent it to Lisbon, according to information inscribed within the codex. Once in Europe, it was acquired by Cardinal Girolamo Casanata who, on his death in 1700, bequeathed it along with his private collection to the Dominican Order, for the creation of a new library, where it is now kept. It was first brought to public attention by the scholar Georg Schurhammer, who published several pictures in the Portuguese historical magazine Garcia da Horta in the 50s. The Códice Casanatense provides an extremely rare insight into the culture of the peoples in Africa and Asia 16th century, and is especially valuable for the study of popular arms and garments of the era. ==Gallery== Abyssinia File:Codice Casanatense Ethiopians.jpgAbyssinian warrior and his wife Nubia File:Codice Casanatense Nubians.jpgNubians Cafreria File:Codice Casanatense Cafres.jpgCafres of the Cape of Good Hope.

It was also the first work published by Benjamin Carr, an English musician who had just immigrated to Philadelphia from England, to become the country's most prolific printer of music in that decade. The actual identity of the lyricist remains a mystery. ==Description== The song was published by Benjamin Carr as part of a series of songs \\"published every Monday\\", sheet music available for \\"One/4 Dollar\\" each. It was composed by a fellow English immigrant and friend of Carr's, Raynor Taylor, who had arrived in the U.S. two years before Carr. The series may not have been especially successful, as it lasted only five weeks. The other four songs in the series were not copyrighted, three being popular songs from London musicals, and the fourth a piano exercise by Alexander Reinagle, another English immigrant and friend of Carr's. The song is written, as originally published, in F major.

One of the Rochester's early pioneers with diverse interests, Culver undertook surveying, road building, fur trading, shipbuilding and worked as a coroner, businessman, politician, and community leader. His legacy for the city of Rochester includes establishment of St. Luke's Episcopal Church on Fitzhugh Street, laying down the East Avenue in the heart of the national historic district, and early log-school house near the Indian Landings. He built one of the first canal boat and shipping vessels for a trade route connecting the Great Lakes along the canal system. Later in his life, he also served in State Legislature. The house was built by Oliver Culver on the southwest corner of East Avenue and Culver Road within the East Avenue Historical District East Avenue Historic District. The original part of the house was built in 1805 as a smaller frame house. In 1816, a new house was built in front of and attached to the older house, the structure that largely remains today. The house was used as a tavern which featured both the front entrance for men and a separate side entrance for women. On the second floor, there is a ballroom with an elliptical ceiling adapted from ship hull design, two symmetric mantles, and a springboard floor constructed to accommodate large number of occupants. The Oliver Culver House has been described as \\"one of the most charming houses in the Genesee Valley\\" In 1906, the owner of the house at the time, third-generation Caroline Culver and her husband relocated the house from the corner of East Avenue and Culver Road to its current location on East Boulevard by East Avenue, about 1,000 ft in distance along the East Avenue. During this move, the old part of the house in the back was partially destroyed. This part was later restored and extended to enlarge the room that is now the library of the house. The house exemplifies the federal neoclassic elements such as slenderness, symmetry, and restraint typified by the American house builders of the era. From its construction in 1816 through 1945, three generations of Culver family resided in the house. In 1945, the house was purchased by Elizabeth Gibson Holahan to be used as her residence. She served as president of the Landmark Society of Western New York (1952-1961), and as president of Rochester Historical Society (1977-2000). She served as director of the restoration of the Revolutionary War General Philip Schuyler Mansion (1764), supervisor of the excavation and restoration of Stone-Tolan House - the oldest house (1792) in Monroe County, director of the restoration of the Patrick Barry Mansion (1857) and undertook relocation and restoration of the George Eastman's boyhood home from Waterville to the George Eastman House. == References == Category:National Register of Historic Places in Rochester, New York ","title":"Culver House"},{"id":"56053555","text":"Lucie-Madeleine d’Estaing (1743–1826), was a French noblewoman, mistress to Louis XV of France from 1760 to 1763.

She is pushed through a door by a one-eyed henchman. She attempts to defend herself, only to discover she has lost her ghostly powers. The henchman leaves her there and she is taken away by a mysterious creature with a mask. Picking up from the events of Chupacabras, Leo and his brother Nando are returning home to Puebla. They run into a gypsy fortune-teller whose wagon has a broken wheel. Nando attempts to bargain with the gypsy for a ride to Puebla, but when she refuses, Leo offers her their help free of charge. The woman offers them free palm readings in gratitude, which only Leo accepts. The gypsy soon grows horrified: Leo's hand has two life lines, a long one that speaks of a bright future and a short, dark one that indicates Leo's involvement with the supernatural has left darkness in his soul. She warns him that if he ever walks the realms of the dead again, he will not come out, and vehemently advises him to run home to his family. A disturbed Leo catches up to Nando, and talk between the two devolves into an argument over Leo leaving Nando and their grandmother in favor of adventures with his \\"imaginary friends\\" (so called because Nando can't see spirits, although he does believe they exist). The fight is interrupted by an old man who attempts to enlist their help in recovering his stolen deer's eye charm from a man called Rupertino. Despite Nando's misgivings about the story, Leo persuades him to help them. They find Rupertino, who really does make a living as a con man, in the caravan where he lives with his young daughter Beatriz. The two brothers are violently attacked by Beatriz while Rupertino denies stealing anything, but they manage to pickpocket Rupertino and flee with the charm. Rupertino and Beatriz discover the theft and give chase, catching up to the pair on a bridge where they have already returned the charm to the old man. The old man confronts Rupertino, who genuinely does not recognize him until the old man laughingly reminds him of an encounter they had twelve years ago. The man reveals himself to be El Charro Negro, a malignant spirit to whom Rupertino sold his soul: Rupertino has since been hiding from El Charro Negro to stop him from collecting the debt. Though Rupertino bravely offers him his soul, El Charro Negro takes Beatriz's soul instead. As El Charro is about to return to the underworld, Leo proposes a bet in return of Beatriz. El Charro appears uninterested, but tells Leo he must visit El Charro in his home if he wants to go through before vanishing through a portal. As Leo and Nando argue over this new development and Rupertino also prepares to join them, the ghost Teodora appears to inform Nando that Finado and Moribunda have been desperately attempting to tell her something. Finado frightens Rupertino, who bolts towards the portal, and in the confusion all of them fall through. Beatriz, who is still alive but slowly fading, is left in the care of Ana; she reveals to Beatriz that her father didn't trade his soul for money. He had done business with El Charro Negro because Beatriz had gotten very sick as a baby and Rupertino had been afraid to lose her as he'd lost Beatriz's mother. The group reappears in El Charro Negro's domain, a sprawling agave field dominated by a luxurious hacienda. Teodora realizes she has lost all her ghost powers and must resort to walking, which she has grown unaccustomed to after nearly six decades as a ghost. Unable to locate Finado and Moribunda, the group advances to El Charro Negro's house. He shows them Beatriz's soul being distilled - when the process concludes, the remnants of Beatriz's soul will leave her body and she will die. Deep in El Charro Negro's home, the alebrije Evaristo is captured and confined to the same agave mill as Xochitl. She reveals to him that El Charro Negro is after Leo. When Finado and Moribunda sneak in to alert them that Leo has walked into El Charro Negro's eager hands, Finado begins to emit a ray of pure energy, which Evaristo identifies as a light produced by the pure of heart. Elsewhere, the other alebrije and the ghost Don Andrés are also shown to be El Charro's captives, kept inside a monstrous house. Don Andrés is also aware of El Charro Negro's interest in Leo and tells Alebrije that there is only one way to save him: they must remove Leo's abilities to interact with the dead to protect him from the evil spirit's interest. Meanwhile, Leo's group agrees to a deal with El Charro Negro: they will venture through his personal fair to retrieve four special objects. If they can find all four before the rooster crows, he will return Beatriz her soul. Teodora and Nando find the Medallion of Miquiztli in the tent of a freak show attraction named the Caterpillar Woman, where they fail to answer her riddle ('what is something that is yours but that others use the most?') and are attacked until Teodora discovers the answer ('your name'). Rupertino and Leo make their way through a giant game of duck shooting towards a glowing crystal as Leo's old enemy Rousseau shoots at them. They are successful, but Leo begins to experience discomfort and discovers that the short black life line has begun extending tendrils down his arm. The group later reconvenes to a giant game of lotería, where they recover the Iyari medallion. The group's final challenge is a fun house. However, they are barred from entering by El Charro Negro once Leo is inside, revealing he has walked into a trap. While all his friends convene outside the house and try to break in, Leo is confronted with a mirror that apparently holds an evil version of himself. He wakes up to El Charro Negro informing him that he has failed and the rooster has crowed; he then presents him with a bottle containing Beatriz's soul in a bottle. Back in the world of the living, Beatriz breathes her last in Ana's company. El Charro Negro refuses Leo's attempts at negotiating and reveals that he has singled out Leo to be his successor, pulling up his sleeve to show Leo his own black-veined arm. He then possesses Leo, forcing him to take on the mantle of El Charro Negro. The bottle containing Beatriz's soul falls and breaks. Outside, Leo's friends are distraught when he emerges wearing El Charro Negro's clothes and wielding the spirit's vast powers. Nando manages to catch him off-guard, which allows Evaristo and Alebrije to fire Finado and Moribunda's pure energy into Leo. After a desperate few minutes, Leo's special powers are finally extracted and a furious Charro Negro abandons Leo's body and prepares to do battle with them in the shape of a shadowy black corpse. Though Leo doesn't want to leave his friends, the portal to the world of the living begins to close. After a parting kiss from Xochitl, Leo, Nando and Rupertino (who has scooped up as much of Beatriz's soul as he could into a gourd) leave for the mortal world. Xochitl, Teodora, Don Andrés, the alebrijes and the two skull children then launch a combined attack against El Charro Negro. Back amongst the living, Rupertino returns to his caravan and pours the scant contents of the gourd into Beatriz's mouth. After a heartbreaking few minutes she finally returns to her father and Ana's joy. After saying their goodbyes, Nando and Leo hurry to Puebla. Back in Puebla, they are greeted by many familiar sights, including the San Juan family bakery. Leo makes his way upstairs to find his grandmother awake in her bed. The two share a tearful reunion, after which they're joined by Nando and by Nana Dionisia, who comments on how grown-up Leo is. Although glad to be home, Leo is saddened at the loss of his friends. Unbeknownst to the San Juan family, Leo's ghostly friends all crown around the bakery's window, having apparently defeated El Charro Negro. They too are sad that Leo can no longer see or hear them. Xochitl has an idea: she uses her powers to ring the bell that hangs outside the bakery and leaves a flower at the door. Leo goes outside at the sound. Unsure but trusting that his friends might hear him, Leo thanks them and tells them that their love and friendship will be with him always. He raises his hand, at which each of his friends touch back. It seems the touch somehow gets through to Leo, who thanks them with a smile.

The film was long rumored since the release of Momias in 2014, and has even been believed to be the next film after (Chupacabras was the true successor and released in 2016 before Charro Negro). The \\"Charro Negro\\" figure was considered to be included in the franchise for a while. In an interview with Proceso, director Alberto Rodríguez said that the company Ánima Estudios has been working on the Leyendas films for 10–15 years, leading up to Charo Negro, with the same team of \\"different abilities\\". In Spanish. \\"[W]e have been working for ten years in these films, [and] we already understand each other very well. Our production structure is very solid, the artists understand the needs of the project,\\" added Rodríguez. For the \\"Charro Negro\\" figure, the filmmakers has considered including him in the franchise for a while. Rodríguez called the figure a \\"very powerful and seductive character\\", making the character \\"dangerous\\". \\"It's interesting how Leo San Juan, our main character, is going to deal with this dark and powerful force,\\" said Rodríguez. The filmmakers wanted to give the figure a more 'Mexican' taste to match the national cinema's 'golden age' by giving him an attractive personality and arming him with golden spurs. \\"It's a historical character,\\" said Rodríguez. \\"We have it in the psyche of the Mexican. We have it very present. [..]It is these people who exploit the needy, and I believe that the Mexican people have suffered a lot from that, from people who are constantly oppressing them.\\" Alberto Rodríguez, who has also co-written the past installments (excluding Nahuala), has penned the script and story with David Israel. \\"It was what I wanted to tell and we hired David Israel to write the script for us,\\" Rodríguez said. \\"At the beginning[,] it was a lot of anguish when creating these feature films, now I have a lot of fun.\\" In order to meet the fans' expectations, the past installments' characters, such as Don Andrés, were brought back for the film, and features references and cameos from the previous films. Animation The film is animated in flash animation. Director Alberto Rodríguez stated that the process was \\"difficult\\", calling it a \\"complex process\\". \\"Animation is a very complex process that requires too much knowledge, not only at the level of the animators but at the level of the production structure,\\" he said. Casting Despite difficulties in developing the voice for Charro Negro, Erick Elías has expressed his satisfaction in working in the animated film. As the previous installments' current voice cast reprise their respective roles, among the newcomers is Erick Elías as the voice of Charro Negro. In Spanish. Elías shared his experience on working in the film, stating that he's satisfied with the work, despite some difficulties in developing a matching tone for the character. \\"[I]t is a pride that I have been invited to be part of this [made] by Mexicans, for Mexicans[.] I feel identified with everything that happens with this Leyenda,\\" he said. \\"I faced great difficulties because I had to give him that personality only with his voice,\\" he said. \\"We had an arduous table job with the director, finding the \\"norteño\\" tone with that serious accent. To achieve it was a very fun and complicated process, but in the end I liked the experience.\\" Elías had previous voice-acting experience prior to Charro Negro, including that of the Spanish-dubbing versions of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and its sequel both produced by Sony Pictures Animation. Elías said his voice work experience in Charro Negro is \\"different\\" from his dubbing roles Meatballs films. \\"It was very different for me,\\" he said. \\"[I]t's completely different from what I had done in dubbing, [which is] another process, because here I was given the freedom to create this [C]harro and I'm happy, I think it's going to be fine.\\" Elías also stated that the film has made him 'happy' since his work in an animated production has helped him reunite with his family. \\"I was flattering that they called me for this, [and] I really like that my daughters are part of something I do[;] not many times I can bring them to the movies and this can be seen,\\" he said at the premiere at the Cinépolis Oasis Coyoacán theater. In Spanish. Alberto Rodríguez said he was also satisfied and shared the same difficult but satisfying experience with working with Elías. \\"We looked for a lot of people, but he gave us that malice that we wanted to impregnate the character because [he] is evil, [and] is possessing the manipulative tone as a particular smirk that gives an ideal scorn to act. We found the balance to be very bad and very nice at the same time,\\" said the director. ==Release== The film was released theatrically in Mexico on 19 January 2018, unlike past installments which were released on an October.

In 1755, Louis François, Prince of Conti launched her as his candidate to replace Madame de Pompadour as official mistress of the king. She was the first serious candidate to be put up against Madame de Pompadour since Charlotte Rosalie de Choiseul-Beaupré, and she was also to be the last. She did succeed to be the secret lover of the king, which attracted some attention at court. She became known as l'altière Vasthi. Ultimately, however, the plot failed, and she was ousted from court by Madame de Pompadour. After this, there was no more serious rival to replace Madame de Pompadour, and the king mainly settled with his unofficial lovers at the Parc-aux-Cerfs. Marie Anne de Coislin had affairs with the Prince de Conti and the count the Coigny, and was claimed to have had affairs with Christian VI of Denmark, Gustav III of Sweden and Peter III of Russia. It is unknown if these rumours where true, but Christian VI and Gustav III did visit her during their visits to Paris, which attracted attention at the time. She did not leave France during the French revolution, but lived as a servant in Rouen, Brittany and Vendée during the Reign of Terror. After the fall of Robespierre, she resumed her former life and property.

Descendants of McCarty occupied mostly the Nockamixon Township side of Haycock Creek. The Frankenfield family were early landowners on the Haycock Township side. As early as 1742 Jesuit fathers from Goshenhoppen began to hold services at McCarty's house and continued until 1798 when the Saint John the Baptist parish was established, the first Catholic Church was built for $150 on land donated by Edward McCarty's nephew John.

Mineralogy consists of argillite and hornfels. About 200 million years ago, magma intruded into the Brunswick and cooled quickly forming a fine grained diabase consisting of primarily labradorite and augite. Haycock Mountain (on the right bank of the creek) and several other features in the area are remnants of the intrusion after the Brunswick has eroded away over time. The first one-third or so if Haycock Creek's course is located in a region of diabase rock which intruded into the local sedimentary layers of the Brunswick Formation during the Jurassic and the Triassic, then the remaining course flows over the Brunswick Formation. ==Crossings and Bridges== {  - !

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie nominated Grewal to lead the Bergen County Prosecutor's office in 2013, but Grewal was never scheduled for a New Jersey Senate confirmation hearing then. Grewal was confirmed by the State Senate when tapped by Christie the second time around in January 2016 as acting prosecutor, and was finalized in the role in November 2016. In this capacity, Grewal has concentrated on fighting the opioid epidemic and white-collar crimes, and strengthening relations between police and communities. In July 2017, while Bergen County prosecutor, Grewal ordered the Mahwah, New Jersey police department not to enforce a ban on non-New Jersey residents using Mahwah parks, stating his concern that a ban could lead to anti-Semitic religious profiling against Orthodox Jews visiting from neighboring Rockland County, New York. On July 26, 2018, two WKXW radio show hosts were suspended for calling Grewal \\"turban man\\" on air. In September 2018, then-Bergen County sheriff Michael Saudino resigned under public official pressure, after secretly recorded comments were released disparaging Grewal's wearing a turban alongside derogatory remarks about other groups of people. == New Jersey Attorney General == March 2019 In March 2019, as New Jersey's Attorney General, Grewal touted the first arrests resulting from a law signed in 2018 by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy outlawing ghost guns, stating, \\"When you see repeatedly the same address, with the same individuals, at the same location continuing to order parts for the same types of guns, some red flags have to go up, that what’s going on here is not somebody who’s an enthusiast or a hobbyist, but rather somebody who’s engaged in illegal trafficking. And that is part of the problem with ghost gun manufacturers, that they are playing fast and loose with our rules.\\" Days later, Grewal filed the first of its kind lawsuit against a ghost gun manufacturer, U.S. Patriot Armory, accusing the company of violating New Jersey's ghost gun ban by ignoring a cease-and-desist order to stop selling rifle-assembly kits to New Jersey buyers. Also in March 2019, Grewal filed lawsuits against ExxonMobil, DuPont, and 3M, accusing the companies of polluting sites in New Jersey; he stated, “We’re sending a strong message to polluters that no matter how big you are, or how powerful you are, or how long you’ve been getting away with contaminating your state’s natural resources, we are going to hold you accountable in court.\\" On March 28, 2019, Grewal announced a directive to all 21 New Jersey county prosecutors to institute college campus outreach protocols to impede sexual violence at the collegiate level.

On May 14, 2019, Grewal announced a lawsuit against several large chemical companies, accusing them of selling toxic firefighting foam for decades while knowing the health risks they posed to the public and to the environment. June 2019 In June 2019, Gurbir Grewal's office forced a Bloomfield, Essex County restaurant which had posted a \\"males only\\" hiring sign to pay $1,000 and implement an anti-discrimination policy and employee training in a settlement; Grewal stated that gender discrimination would not be tolerated in the overall hiring process. In mid- June, Grewal filed a lawsuit against a Nevada gun dealer for selling high- capacity gun magazines illegally to an undercover agent in New Jersey, despite a prior cease-and-desist order issued to the company barring the marketing, selling, and shipping of high-capacity gun magazines to New Jersey residents. August 2019 On August 6, 2019, Gurbir Grewal announced the creation of the first U.S. statewide program to support the mental health of police officers.

Built in 1924, this is one of three hotels remaining from the early-20th century resort boom at Red Boiling Springs. In 1986, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places along with the Donoho Hotel and the Thomas House. Armour's Hotel is the only Red Boiling Springs hotel still offering the mineral springs services that made this area an attraction in the 1890s and early 20th century. ==Description== The hotel is an example of colonial revival architecture, constructed of locally produced brick. Although at its peak there were additional buildings to boost occupancy, the original structure has only 24 guest rooms. The hotel was built in a T-shape, featuring a full-length two-storey porch facing northeast along the 61-foot front of the building, with two-storey columns of brick and wood. It has a metal gable roof, with wide eaves supported by vertical wood brackets, and wood shingles decorating the gable ends. Eleven guest rooms are on the first floor. There is a cherry wood stairway to the second floor, which includes 15 guest rooms. Access to the upstairs guest rooms is from an interior hallway, and only one downstairs guest room has an external door, which allows access to a southeast-facing sun porch. Each guest room has an individual bathroom. In addition, there is a bathhouse with twin claw-foot bath tubs for mineral water baths. ==History== The 1880s saw a boom in the development of mineral springs resorts as summer destinations, inspired by the success of Saratoga Springs, New York. Early in this decade, New York businessman James F. O. Shaughnessy purchased the Red Boiling Springs tract and began development of the area as a resort. Counts Hotel was built on a bank overlooking the creek in 1924. The Red Boiling Springs resort was at its peak, with six hotels each having about 50 or 60 rooms, and all including three Southern-style meals each day with the price of the room. There were also at least nine boarding houses. The hotel was first called Smith's Brick Hotel, being the first brick hotel in the area. It gained the Counts Hotel name when it was purchase by Henry Counts in the 1940s. Counts installed modern luxuries: plumbing, electricity, and ensuite bathrooms for each room. Of the original five types of mineral water available at the resort, three types were available on the Counts Hotel property: \\"white,\\" \\"red\\" and \\"black.\\" One of the two doctors in the town would prescribe the appropriate water and dosage to each guest. The \\"white\\" water was recommended to aid digestion. The sulfurous \\"red\\" water was said to be helpful for the bladder and for Bright's disease. The sulfur and magnesium \\"black\\" water was claimed to treat the stomach and liver. It remained open in 1952, when only Cloyd Hotel and Counts Hotel were still operating, and has been open almost continuously. Today, it is the only hotel which still offers the traditional mineral water baths. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Macon County, Tennessee Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Tennessee Category:National Register of Historic Places in Macon County, Tennessee ","title":"Counts Hotel"},{"id":"56053674","text":"Matthew Joseph Flynn (born October 3, 1947) is an American attorney and politician from Wisconsin. Flynn served as chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin from 1981 to 1985 and as a partner in the Milwaukee law firm of Quarles & Brady. Flynn ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for Governor of Wisconsin in 2018 and is a past unsuccessful candidate for federal office. == Early life and military service == Flynn was born in 1947 in New York City and raised in Middlebush, New Jersey. He graduated from Yale College in 1969 and served as an officer in the United States Navy from 1969-72. After being honorably discharged, Flynn subsequently attended the University of Wisconsin Law School, where, in his capacity as editor-in-chief of the Wisconsin Law Review, he authored a proposal in 1974 that sought to reform the Milwaukee Police Department by increasing its political independence and accountability to the community. \\"Police Accountability in Wisconsin\\", Wisconsin Law Review. Vol. 1974: p. 1131-1166, by Matthew J. Flynn In the article, Flynn argued that the provisions established in the late 19th century to shield the police from venal politicians only served to make Wisconsin police independent of constructive public and political control. Flynn suggested new legislation to increase public input to check police discretion. ==Career==  Early legal career and political involvement  Following his graduation, Flynn was a law clerk to Chief Judge Thomas Edward Fairchild of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit from 1975 until 1976. In 1976, Flynn entered private practice in Milwaukee with the firm Quarles & Brady. In 1978, Flynn was the Democratic nominee for United States Representative in the 9th congressional district, losing to Republican state Senator Jim Sensenbrenner. In 1980, he served as Milwaukee County chair for U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy's unsuccessful presidential bid.  Wisconsin Democratic Party chairman (1981-1985)  In October 1981, Flynn was elected as state chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. Flynn embraced a progressive platform as state chair and advocated to maintain Wisconsin's open presidential primary, a stance that put him at odds with the Democratic National Committee. During Flynn's first term as chairman, the state party reelected Senator William Proxmire and reclaimed the governorship after a four-year period of Republican control. Flynn imposed fiscal controls on party spending and mounted an aggressive fundraising campaign that eliminated debt accumulated by the party under his predecessors.  Litigation  After completing his second term as state Democratic chairman, Flynn returned to Quarles & Brady, retiring in 2017 as a partner. During his career, Flynn represented clients including the Episcopal Diocese of Milwaukee, Milwaukee- based corporation Johnson Controls, local TV station WISN-TV, and the Archdiocese of Milwaukee in civil litigation concerning the Catholic Church sex abuse crisis. In his personal capacity, Flynn has supported expanding reporting requirements surrounding sex abuse and increasing the civil liability of clergy members accused of abuse.  Senate and congressional elections  In 1986, Flynn contested the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat held by Republican Bob Kasten, placing second to former deputy attorney general Ed Garvey in the primary. In 1988 and 2004, he placed second in Democratic primaries for Wisconsin's 5th congressional district and 4th congressional district. During the administration of Governor Jim Doyle, Flynn served one term as chair of the governor's Judicial Selection Commission from 2004 to 2006.  Activism and writing (2004-present)  Flynn co-chaired John Kerry's unsuccessful 2004 presidential campaign in Wisconsin and served on Hillary Clinton's finance committee during her unsuccessful Wisconsin 2008 presidential primary campaign against Barack Obama. Flynn has written two fiction novels since retirement, publishing a political satire called Pryme Knumber in 2012 and a followup work, Bernie Weber and the Riemann Hypothesis, in 2017. Flynn has written a progressive political blog and was a regular pundit on the now-defunct Milwaukee television show Belling & Co, providing a Democratic perspective. Flynn has hosted the radio show \\"Matt Flynn Direct\\" on WRRD since 2019.https://talk1017fm.com/series/matt-flynn-direct/ == 2018 gubernatorial campaign == In October 2017, Flynn announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination to oppose Scott Walker in the 2018 Wisconsin gubernatorial election. In November 2017, Flynn received attention for his proposal to legalize both recreational and medicinal cannabis in Wisconsin. Flynn has received numerous endorsements, including the support of former Governor Tony Earl, Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, Milwaukee County Register of Deeds John La Fave, businessman Edward J. Zore, former Wisconsin Secretary of Administration Steve Bablitch, and former Wisconsin Secretary of Commerce Cory Nettles. Milwaukee County Supervisor Sylvia Ortiz-Velez has also endorsed Flynn for Governor. Flynn has vowed to work to repeal economic policies implemented during Governor Walker's tenure, which Flynn called \\"wage-killing.\\" He also plans to introduce a bill to raise the minimum wage in Wisconsin to $15 per hour. The Republican Party of Wisconsin has criticized Flynn for his past legal work on behalf of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee in cases involving allegations of sexual abuse. Several activists and organizations have called for Flynn to drop-out of the gubernatorial race due to his representation of the Archdiocese, including State Representatives Chris Taylor and Melissa Sargent, the Women's March Wisconsin Chapter, National Organization for Women Wisconsin Chapter, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, and The Capital Times. Flynn has responded by telling his critics to \\"jump in a lake.\\" Flynn has compared accusations against him to \\"McCarthyism\\" and told a survivor of abuse to \\"knock it off.\\" == Sources == Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from New York City Category:Politicians from Milwaukee Category:Democratic Party of Wisconsin chairs Category:Lawyers from Milwaukee Category:Novelists from Wisconsin Category:Writers from New York City Category:Yale College alumni Category:University of Wisconsin Law School alumni Category:Novelists from New York (state) Category:21st-century American novelists Category:American male novelists Category:21st-century American male writers ","title":"Matt Flynn (politician)"},{"id":"56053726","text":"Ella Simmons is a Seventh-day Adventist administrator and educator.

Jørgen Young owned the brewery for some time before it was purchased by Christian Julius Schou (1792–1874) in 1837. The brewery was operated at several different locations in Oslo, and in 1873 operations were moved to a new facility at the Schousløkken property at Trondheimsveien (Trondheim Street) no. 2. The Schou Brewery took over the Foss Brewery in 1917, when the Foss Brewery was unable to receive raw materials from Germany during the First World War. In 1962, the Schou Brewery merged with Frydenlund Breweries to create the Merged Breweries Company (). That company operated until 1977 as the Frydenlund Schou Brewery (). In 1977 the company was taken over by Nora Industries (), which also owned the Ringnes brewery and Nora Mineral Water (). The Schou Brewery was Norway's oldest brewery when it shut down in 1981. ==The Schou Brewery today== Beer from Schouskjelleren Mikrobryggeri The neighborhood where the brewery was located is largely protected by the Urban Conservation Office, which has resulted in good conservation of major parts of the original brewery. The area is dominated by large brick industrial buildings from the last century, combined with newer modern premises. Until 2005, BI Norwegian Business School was a major tenant of the property, with the Norwegian School of Marketing (Norges Markedshøyskole) centrally located in the neighborhood. Several municipal businesses have office space in the area, including Oslo Water and Sewerage and the Real Estate and Urban Renewal Office. The brewery building is owned by the insurance company KLP. Since 2010, the Schou Cellar Microbrewery (Schouskjelleren Mikrobryggeri) has operated in the property's basement. Schous Pils is still brewed, but on a small scale by Ringnes Brewery and sold at some pubs and bars in Oslo.Schaus Pils Ringnes Bryggeri (in Norwegian) ==Culture== For a long time, the municipality of Oslo sought to establish a \\"culture district\\" in Oslo in order to provide a gathering place for cultural activities. During the process of choosing a venue for a rock music museum, gradually both cultural and political forces agreed on the Schou neighborhood as a suitable place. In the end, Namsos was chosen as the site of the rock music museum, but private initiatives are underway to start a private museum in the Schou Brewery building. In addition to an experience center for Norwegian rock, several other music-related ideas are planned for the brewery area. The municipality would like to use the brewery's former wort building (Vørterhuset) for training rooms designed for bands and solo performers. Another venue for musicians is Shou Corner (Schous Corner), a tavern that has featured live music all year long for a number of years. The Schou Corner building has protected status, but due to major subsidence damage to the structure there are plans to raze it and rebuild on a better foundation, and to continue the tavern business there. A private music school is under construction, and the music business Imerslund Musikk has opened a new shop in the oldest building in the neighborhood. The Schou Cultural Brewery (Schous kulturbryggeri) is a large cultural venue in Oslo that transforms parts of the former Schou Brewery into a living cultural district. Five projects are located here: * The Pop Center (Popsenteret), an interactive museum for Norwegian popular music * The Practice Hotel (Øvingshotellet), with fifty rehearsal rooms for bands, soloists, and choirs * The National Stage (Riksscene), for Norwegian and international folk music, joik, and folk dancing * The Culture Station (Kulturstasjon), with dance, theater, and visual arts for children and young people The state is responsible for the National Stage for folk dance and folk music. The municipality of Oslo is responsible for the other three projects. There is a widespread use of common functions, making the Schou Cultural Brewery a major cultural institution. Parts of the activity take place in the old brewery buildings, and a modern new building will also be built in the rear courtyard. The Schou Cultural Brewery was set up as a project in the Culture and Sports Center (Kultur- og idrettsetaten), led by a steering committee appointed by the Oslo City Council. The Practice Hotel and the Culture Station were opened 2008, and the rest of the Schou Cultural Brewery was completed in 2009. ==References== Category:Breweries in Norway Category:Defunct companies of Norway Category:Grünerløkka Category:Food and drink companies disestablished in 1981 Category:1981 disestablishments in Norway ","title":"Schou Brewery"},{"id":"56053749","text":"Carolus Polodig, O.C.D.

The Court unanimously held that legislation providing for the representation of the Northern Territory and the Australia Capital Territory in the Senate had been passed in accordance with section 57 of the Constitution and, by majority, that the representation of the territories was constitutionally valid. == Background ==  Representation in the Senate  Section 7 of the Constitution provides for the composition of the Senate: Section 122 provides for the Commonwealth to make laws for any territory, including for the representation of the territories in Parliament: Prior to the passage of the Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973, only the States had been represented in the Senate. The Act provided for the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory to each be represented by two Senators. At the time, each State was represented by 10 Senators.  Deadlocks between the Houses of Parliament  Section 57 of the Constitution provides the procedure for the breaking of deadlocks between the House of Representatives and the Senate:  Passage of the laws  During its first term in office, the Whitlam Government held a majority in the House of Representatives but not the Senate, which twice rejected 10 government bills. Amongst those bills, the Commonwealth Electoral Bill (No 2) 1973 was rejected for a second time on 29 August 1973, and the Representation Bill 1973 and the Senate (Representation of Territories) Bill 1973 were both rejected for a second time on 14 November 1973. On 14 February 1974, the Governor-General, Sir Paul Hasluck, prorogued the Parliament until 28 February 1974. Subsequently, on 14 April 1974, the Governor-General dissolved both Houses, citing 6 bills which had been twice rejected by the Senate, including the Commonwealth Electoral Bill (No 2) 1973, the Representation Bill 1973, and the Senate (Representation of Territories) Bill 1973. At the double dissolution election in May 1974, the Whitlam government was returned with a slightly reduced majority in the House of Representatives and still without a Senate majority. Following the Senate's further rejection of the bills used as justification for the double dissolution election, an historic joint sitting of the Commonwealth Parliament was convened in August 1974, at which all 6 of the rejected bills which had been cited for the double dissolution were passed. The joint sitting had also passed another Act, the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Act 1973, which was successfully challenged in Victoria v Commonwealth on the basis that there had not been the required gap between the Senate's first and second rejections of that Act.. == Argument == The states of Western Australia and New South Wales challenged the validity of all 3 electoral Acts on the basis that they had not be passed in accordance with section 57. They also, along with the state of Queensland, challenged the validity of the Act providing for territory representation on the ground that the Constitution did not allow the Parliament to provide for full representation of the territories in the Senate. The plaintiffs argued that the laws were not validly passed by the Parliament because the prorogation of Parliament and the passage of time between the Senate rejecting the laws for a second time and the proclamation dissolving the Parliament meant that the bills were not proposed law within the meaning of section 57, that the prorogation had precluded the exercise of the power to dissolve both Houses of Parliament and that the joint sitting was invalid because it had acted beyond power in considering the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Act 1973. In relation to the representation of the territories, the plaintiffs argued that section 7 of the Constitution established the Senate as a States' House and that the representation envisaged by section 122 must be something less than full membership. Four future High Court judges appeared as counsel in the case: Ronald Wilson, then the Solicitor-General for Western Australia, William Deane, for New South Wales, Michael McHugh, as junior counsel for the Commonwealth, and Daryl Dawson, then the Solicitor-General for Victoria. == Decision == Each member of the Court delivered a separate opinion. The Court unanimously held that the laws had been validly passed in accordance with section 57 and by majority held that the Commonwealth could validly provide for full representation of the territories in the Senate.  Passage of the laws  All members of the Court, other than Barwick CJ, held that section 57 does not impose a requirement of undue delay between the second rejection of the proposed laws and the dissolution of Parliament by the Governor-General. Barwick CJ found that whilst there was a temporal limitation requiring the second rejection and the double dissolution to be related in time so as to form part of a current disagreement between the Houses, the lapse of time in this case was not sufficient to disqualify the bills from forming the basis for a double dissolution. The entire Court also rejected the argument that the laws were invalid because the joint sitting had invalidly considered and passed the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Act 1973.  Representation of the territories  McTiernan, Mason, Jacobs and Murphy JJ upheld the validity of the Act providing for Senators from the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. They held that the words of section 122 must be given their full meaning and be read as an exception to section 7. Mason J held this in the following terms: page 270. The majority also rejected the argument that allowing for full territory representation in the Senate could permit the Commonwealth to 'swamp' the Senate with territory Senators, effectively reducing the representation of the States. The majority said that the proper interpretation of the Constitution was not to be affected by the fear that a power might be abused. Barwick CJ, Gibbs and Stephen JJ dissented. Each held that because section 7 referred only to the States, it was intended that the Senate would be a States' House and that the concept of representation envisaged by section 122 must be limited to less than full representation. Stephen J held in the following terms: page 258. == Subsequent events == The first territory Senators were elected at the 1975 election. Following a change in the High Court's membership, McTiernan J retired in 1976 and was replaced by Aickin J, the representation of the territories was re- challenged in Queensland v Commonwealth (1977). The High Court again upheld the legislation, this time by an increased majority, with Mason, Jacobs and Murphy JJ affirming their earlier judgements, and Gibbs and Stephen JJ applying stare decisis to find that the legislation was constitutionally valid even though they considered the decision in Western Australia v Commonwealth to be wrong. == References == Category:High Court of Australia cases Category:1975 in Australian law Category:1975 in case law Category:Australian constitutional law ","title":"Western Australia v Commonwealth (1975)"},{"id":"56053762","text":"Atomic Energy Research Establishment is a government nuclear research station in Bangladesh and is located in Savar Upazila, Bangladesh.

The first councillors were George Vickery, John Thomas Scown, Duncan Cameron, Thomas Jones, and James Stone. The council seat was at Meadows in the north of the district. Kondoparinga was abolished in March 1935, taking effect from 1 May that year, by enactment of the Local Government Areas (Re-arrangement) Acts 1929 and 1931. Most of Kondoparinga was amalgamated with most of Echunga, Clarendon and Macclesfield councils to form the new District Council of Meadows, so named for the council seat of the old Kondoparinga council. The remainder of Kondoparinga was annexed by the District Council of Strathalbyn. Approximate bounds of the Kondoparinga district in 1853, shown on a present- day road map with relation to Adelaide, to the north, and Victor Harbor, to the south ==Location== At its establishment, the council area comprised the Hundred of Kondoparinga as well as a central portion of the Hundred of Kuitpo. The western boundary stretched northwards from Mount Magnificent south and north trig stations to Wickham Hill and the Onkaparinga River just north of Blewitt Springs. The northern boundary stretched eastwards from Blewitt Springs to Mount Panorama trig station, north east to the Onkaparinga just west of the present-day Mount Bold Reservoir, east along the river to approximately the centre of the present-day reservoir, then south south east to a point about north-west of the Meadows town centre and from there generally eastwards to the hundred boundary about the same distance east of the township. The eastern boundary followed the Hundred of Kondoparinga north east and south east boundary to just south of the township of Finniss and the south boundary followed the hundred's southern boundary. The council lay either side of Bull Creek Road, in the south, and Dashwood Gully Road, the north, for much of their length, including within its bounds the towns of Ashbourne, Meadows and Finniss as well as the smaller settlements of Paris Creek, Bull Creek, Prospect Hill, Blackfellows Creek, McHarg Creek, the historic settlement of Dashwood Gully, and the localities of Mount Observation and Mount Magnificent on the southern boundary. The council area also included the majority of Kuitpo Forest Reserve in the west, and present-day land reserves of Bullock Hill, Cox Scrub and Finniss Conservation Parks in the south. ==Chairmen== * Samuel Howard Ross (circa 1925 – circa 1935) * James Nicol (circa 1918 – circa 1925) ==References== Kondoparinga, District Council of Category:1853 establishments in Australia Category:1935 disestablishments in Australia ","title":"District Council of Kondoparinga"},{"id":"56053877","text":"The 195th Heavy Combined Arms Brigade () is a maneuver formation of People's Liberation Army Ground Force.

He is related to Mobile Malachi, a Belizean Kriol Reggae artist and musician. He is also a cousin of Papoose, who is of Liberian descent. Inspired by his uncle Dwight who was a rapper and graphic artist, Jenks first began making beats when he was in elementary school, using FL Studio on his uncle's computer. == Career == Jenks went to school for graphic design for a year before dropping out. At 18, his uncle encouraged him to pursue his career in music and Jenks moved to Atlanta to study sound engineering at the SAE Institute. While in school, he met and began collaborating with DJ Burn One, who encouraged him to create his own instrumentals and not rely on samples. After graduating school, the studio where the two worked hired him as a full-time engineer. In 2015, Jenks began working for Epic Records as a sound engineer, leaving a year later to focus on his own career. Jenks began producing for Young Nudy and Trippie Redd in 2016. He met Playboi Carti in February 2017, collaborating on the track \\"Woke Up Like This\\" and producing most tracks on his debut project. Their song \\"Magnolia\\" peaked at 29 on the US Billboard Hot 100. This kickstarted Jenks' producing career, producing songs for 21 Savage, Trippie Redd, Rich the Kid, Lil Yachty, Famous Dex, Nav, Young Thug and Lil Uzi Vert. Jenks has also released a series of mixtapes called The Life of Pi'erre and has his own imprint, SossHouse, at Interscope Records. He produced Travis Scott's single \\"Watch\\" which features Kanye West and Lil Uzi Vert. He also produced Playboi Carti's album Die Lit. He also helped produce for Kanye West's albums Ye and Jesus Is King. On May 8, 2019, Pi'erre Bourne & close collaborator Young Nudy dropped their collaborative mixtape titled Sli'merre. The project, which consists of 12 songs, featured then-rising hip-hop stars DaBaby and Megan Thee Stallion, along with Nudy's cousin and multi-platinum rapper 21 Savage, as well as fellow multi-platinum recording artist Lil Uzi Vert. All songs on the mixtape were produced by Pi'erre, and hit number 1 on Apple Music's US All Genres chart, and debuted at number 167 on the Billboard 200, later peaking at number 63 in the following week. On March 25, 2020, Jenks debuted at No. 1 on Billboards Hot 100 Producers chart, thanks to four production credits on the deluxe edition of Lil Uzi Vert's second album, Eternal Atake. On June 19, 2020, almost exactly a year after The Life of Pi'erre 4s release, a deluxe edition was released. ==Artistry== Jenks is influenced by Wiz Khalifa, Young Jeezy, Gucci Mane, J Dilla, Pharrell Williams, Timbaland and Kanye West. Like West, Jenks wants to continue to work as a producer, while pursuing his own rap career. Alphonse Pierre of Pitchfork described Bourne's productions as \\"beats that pair airy video-game melodies with classic trap drums\\". == Discography ==  Studio albums  { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" !

Although the song is one of Kudo's most recognizable hits, as well as widely considered to be her breakout hit, and despite the fact that it was included on the compilation album Harvest, released later that same year, it was never featured on any of Kudo's studio albums. At the 4th Japan Gold Disc Awards, \\"Arashi no Sugao\\" was one of the five recipients of the award for Best Single of the Year. In 2015, DAM asked their users to select their favorite Shizuka Kudo songs to sing karaoke to and compiled a top ten list; \\"Arashi no Sugao\\" was ranked number seven. ==Composition and critical reception== The song was written by Yoshiko Miura and composed and produced by Tsugutoshi Gotō. Lyrically, the song explores themes of scorned love and vulnerability. Miura describes a protagonist's volatile state of mind after being abandoned by a condescending lover, to whom she vows to \\"raise up a storm and destroy everything\\". Kudo was praised for her vocal performance and unique tone, credited by critics as one of the main elements behind the success of the song. ==Live performances== The live performances of \\"Arashi no Sugao\\" achieved fame for the accompanying choreography. After delivering the choruses, Kudo would perform a specific hand movement which involved moving her hand repeatedly below and along the side of her face to the beat of the song. Bobby Yoshino, who choreographed the routine, was inspired by tutting to create the famous hand move. Along with the shoulder-padded skirt suit Kudo wore to perform the song, this signature hand movement is often replicated by comedians performing impressions of Kudo. ==Cover versions== In 2006, Nana Kitade recorded a cover for her second EP, Cutie Bunny. In 2012, Janet Kay recorded an English-language cover of the song for her cover album Idol Kay. In 2014, the girl group Feam recorded a cover of the song for their album, Re:Idol: Hajimete no Chū. \\"Arashi no Sugao\\" was covered by Kenichi Suzumura as part of the Shizuka Kudo-as-sung-by male voice actors tribute album, Shizuka Kudo Tribute, released in 2017. In 2015, Nanase Aikawa, who credits Kudo as being the artist who inspired her to become a singer and whose songs, including \\"Arashi no Sugao\\", she sang at auditions, performed a duet of the song with Kudo at her concert commemorating her 20th anniversary. ==Chart performance== \\"Arashi no Sugao\\" debuted at number-one on the Oricon Singles Chart, where it stayed for three consecutive weeks. It charted in the top ten for nine straight weeks. \\"Arashi no Sugao\\" stayed in the top hundred for a total of 21 weeks and moved over 500,000 copies during its run. The single ranked at number eight on the year-end Oricon Singles Chart for 1989, and was one of three singles released by Kudo that year to rank in the yearly top ten. ==Track listingCharts== style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" Chart (1989) !scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Weekly Singles (Oricon)  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"1 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Monthly Singles (Oricon)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Yearly Singles (Oricon)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"8 } ==Certification== - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan (RIAJ)  Platinum  524,000 - ==See also== * List of Oricon number-one singles ==References== Category:1989 songs Category:1989 singles Category:Songs about betrayal Category:Songs written by Tsugutoshi Gotō Category:Oricon Weekly number-one singles Category:Shizuka Kudo songs Category:Nana Kitade songs Category:Kenichi Suzumura songs Category:Pony Canyon singles ","title":"Arashi no Sugao"},{"id":"56054078","text":"Moto E or variation may refer to: ==Motorcycling== * FIM MotoE World Championship, electric superbike motorcycle championship * FIM Moto E European Championship, electric sportbike motorcycle championship * FIM MotoE class of competition motorcycle, used in the various FIM Moto e series * Energica Ego, the Ego electric motorcycle family from the Energica Motor Company used for the various FIM MotoE series ==Motorola== Moto E is the name of a series of Android smartphone developed by Motorola Mobility, including: * Motorola Moto E series of mobile phones ** Moto E (1st generation) 2014 ** Moto E (2nd generation) 2015 ** Moto E3 (3rd generation) 2016 ** Moto E4 (4th generation) 2017 ** Moto E5 (5th generation) 2018 ==See also== * Motorola Moto, a brand of Motorola Mobility including a wider range of products * MotoGP, family of motorcycle racing grand prix * Emoto * Moto (disambiguation) * E (disambiguation) ","title":"Moto E (disambiguation)"},{"id":"56054131","text":"Uchain is a town and a Nagar Palika in Bharatpur district in the state of Rajasthan, India. ==References== Category:Cities and towns in Bharatpur district ","title":"Uchain"},{"id":"56054154","text":"is a Japanese guitarist, composer, and producer.

From 1798 to 1800, during the Quasi-War with France, he was a captain in the U.S. Army and aide-de-camp to Alexander Hamilton, his uncle, who was then Major General of the Army. ==Early life and education== Church as a child by John Trumbull, 1784 Church was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 14, 1778. He was the oldest child of Angelica Schuyler Church and John Barker Church, a British-born merchant and member of Parliament. As a small child, he moved with his family from New York to Paris, where he and his mother were painted together by John Trumbull. After 18 months, the Church family moved to London, and Philip was educated for six years at Eton College. He began the study of law at the Middle Temple before returning to New York in 1797. In New York, he continued his law studies, working in the offices of Nathaniel Pendleton. He also served as a U.S. Army captain and was appointed aide-de-camp to Alexander Hamilton from 1798 to 1800, while Hamilton was Major General and Inspector General of the Army during the Quasi-War with France. His mother, Angelica, was the sister of Hamilton's wife Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton. Prior to his admission to practice law in New York, Church served as second to his cousin Philip Hamilton in his fatal 1801 duel with George Eacker. ==Settlement of Allegany County== In May 1800, at the age of 22, Church became a major landowner in western New York, with a tract of of land in present-day Allegany County and Genesee County, New York that had been a portion of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. Church's father John Barker Church had loaned money to financier Robert Morris, and accepted a mortgage on the tract in May 1796 as security for the debt owed to him by Morris. After Morris failed to pay the mortgage, John Barker Church foreclosed and sent Philip to Canandaigua in May 1800 to attend the foreclosure sale, where Philip made a successful bid and acquired the tract. Philip Church traveled in 1801 to the area with his surveyor Moses Van Campen and four others to take possession of the land. Church selected specific acreage for a planned village along the Genesee River, with plots and design to be reminiscent of Paris. The plan included a circular road enclosing a village park at the center of town, streets radiating from the circular road to form a star, and five churches situated around the circle. Philip named the village Angelica, after his mother, and began to open it up for sale to settlers. By 1803, the village was populated with log cabin homes, including Church's, and he had erected a sawmill and a gristmill. On February 4, 1805, Church married Anna Matilda Stewart (1786–1865), the daughter of General Walter Stewart. Soon after their wedding in Philadelphia, the two settled in the village of Angelica, where a small whitewashed house (locally known as the \\"White House\\") had already been built for the couple on the banks of the Genesee River. In 1806, Angelica and John Barker Church began construction on a thirty-room mansion nearby, called Belvidere, which still stands as a privately owned home on the banks of the Genesee in Belmont, New York, near the town of Angelica. Although they had intended to make it their summer home, it instead became the residence of Philip and Anna Church when it was partially completed in 1810. == Career and later life == Church was still under 30 when he was appointed the first Judge of the New York County Court for Allegany County, in 1807. He died in Angelica on January 7, 1861, at the age of 82. The New York Times cited the Erie Railway as Church's \\"great work to which for a number of years he devoted his time and applied his energies... which he lived to see completed and the process of transformation which followed fairly begun.\\" The Times also credited Church with being the first to suggest the idea of the Genesee Valley Canal, and influential in its completion. == Children == Philip and Anna Church had nine children. These included: * Elizabeth, who married Robert Horwood (or Harwood), and resided in England * Major Richard Church, who held a position as a political appointee in the New York Custom House * Angelica (d. 1895), who married John Warren and resided in New York City ==References== Category:Schuyler family Category:1778 births Category:1861 deaths Category:American people of Dutch descent ","title":"Philip Church"},{"id":"56054162","text":"A fire in the Leogrand Hotel & Casino in Georgia's Black Sea city of Batumi occurred on the night of 24 to 25 November 2017. It left 11 people dead. After the incident, the hotel rebranded itself as Welmond. == Incident == The fire in the 22-storey five-star hotel broke out around 20:00 local time, with many strongly suspecting the starting location at the spa center. Thirteen rescue and firefighting vehicles and approximately 100 firefighters were deployed and more than 100 people were evacuated. The hotel was due to host the Miss Georgia beauty pageant. None of the 20 contestants were injured. The owner and executive producer of the pagent told reporters that the contestants were in the middle of rehearsal when they were told to evacuate to a terrace. == Victims == Eleven people, ten Georgian nationals and one Iranian national, died, all from inhaling fumes. Eight of the victims were found trapped in an elevator, one in a swimming pool, and two were discovered in the hotel gym. Twenty-one people were hospitalized of which were a firefighter, four Turkish nationals and one Israeli national. == Investigation == Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili vowed to punish and identify all those that were responsible for the fire, with Interior Minister Giorgi Gakharia backing his calls for an investigation into the breach of fire-safety norms. Police said an investigation into possible breaches of fire safety regulations was launched. In 2018 the Georgian Prosecutor's Office requested the detention of a Turkish citizen who was the technical manager of the hotel, and a Georgian citizen who was a staff manager of the technical storage team. Investigators determined that easily inflammable materials which had been placed in the technical storage room helped intensify the fire and caused strong smoke. The hotel was also not equipped with automatic fire and smoke alarm systems. The two detained men, the Turkish manager and the Georgian storage staff member, were sentenced by the Batumi City Court to five years and six months and two years in prison, respectively. == Aftermath == The Government of Georgia declared a national day of mourning for November 27 for all of the victims of the fire. The Catholicos Patriach of All Georgia Ilia II expressed his sympathy for the tragedy and offered his condolences to the victims and their families from the Georgian Church at a service he delivered at the hotel. Shortly after the fire, a new law was prepared by the Emergency Management Service for parliament that increased fines imposed on fire safety rules by ten times. Also noted for the creation of the bill was multiple previous shopping center fires in Tbilisi. == References == Category:Fires in Georgia (country) Category:2017 in Georgia (country) Category:2017 fires Category:Hotel fires Category:History of Adjara Category:November 2017 events in Europe Category:November 2017 events in Asia Category:Batumi ","title":"2017 Batumi hotel fire"},{"id":"56054168","text":"Melissa Hart is a justice of the Colorado Supreme Court. ==Biography== Hart was born to Phyllis Cox, a lawyer specializing in human rights, and Robert C.

The project was announced in September 2017 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said that the aim was to complete the electrification process by December 2018. Certain households identified via the Socio-economic and Caste Census (SECC) of 2011 will be eligible for free electricity connections, while others will be charged Rs. 500. On 16 November, 2017, the government launched a website saubhagya.gov.in to disseminate information about the scheme. The total outlay of the project is Rs. 16, 320 crore while the Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) is Rs. 12,320 crore. The beneficiary household will get One LED lights, one DC power plug. It also includes the Repair and Maintenance of Meter Only (R&M;) for 5 years. ==Responses== 91% of rural Indian households have received electricity access by june 2019.

It acts as a potent and selective silent antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR). The drug is a diarylthiohydantoin derivative. It is closely related to enzalutamide and apalutamide. Both RD-162 and enzalutamide show 5- to 8-fold higher affinity for the AR than the first-generation NSAA bicalutamide, and only 2- to 3-fold lower affinity than dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the major endogenous ligand of the receptor in the prostate gland. RD-162 and enzalutamide were developed together and were derived from the nonsteroidal androgen RU-59063, which itself was derived from the first-generation NSAA nilutamide. RD-162 and enzalutamide were selected as the lead compounds from a group of over 200 compounds that were synthesized and assayed for antiandrogenic activity. Enzalutamide was ultimately selected from the two for further clinical development and was eventually marketed. RD-162 is also very closely related to apalutamide, with the two compounds differing only by the replacement of a single atom (a carbon atom in one of the phenyl rings of RD-162 swapped with a nitrogen atom in apalutamide). Apalutamide was approved for the treatment of prostate cancer in 2018.http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800032695 ==References== Category:Abandoned drugs Category:Benzamides Category:Fluoroarenes Category:Hormonal antineoplastic drugs Category:Ketones Category:Nitriles Category:Nonsteroidal antiandrogens Category:Spiro compounds Category:Thioureas Category:Trifluoromethyl compounds ","title":"RD-162"},{"id":"56054410","text":"The 2017 SAFF U-15 Women's Championship was the 1st edition of the SAFF U-15 Women's Championship, an international football competition for women's under-15 national teams organized by SAFF.

They are mainly used in conjunction with the motorized rifle troops in the main areas and perform the following tasks: * in defence – on direct support of the motorized rifle troops in repelling the enemy's offensive and application of counter-attacks and counter-strikes; * in offence – on delivering powerful cleave strikes deeply, developing success, defeating the enemy in meeting engagements and battles. The Tank Troops are made up of tank divisions, tank brigades, tank regiments and tank battalions of motorized rifle and tank brigades which are highly resistant to the damaging effects of nuclear weapons, have high firepower, high mobility and manoeuvrability. They are able to make full use of the results of nuclear fires - nuclear destruction of the enemy - and, ideally, can quickly achieve the ultimate military goals of any combat or operation. The combat capabilities of tank formations and subunits enable them to lead active combat operations, day and night, in significant isolation from other troops, to smash the enemy in meeting engagements and battles, on the move to overcome the extensive areas of contamination, to force water barriers, as well as to quickly build a solid defence and successfully resist the attack of superior forces of the enemy. Further development and increase of the combat capabilities of the Tank Troops are carried out mainly at the expense of its framing with more advanced types of tanks, in which there is the optimal combination of such vital military properties as high firepower, manoeuvrability and reliable protection. In improving the organizational forms the main efforts are focused on giving them the combined-arms nature, what to the utmost suits the content of modern operations (combat actions). Their service anniversary, Day of Tankmen, is marked annually every second Sunday of September. == Brief history == Russia's first every armoured unit, the 1st Machine Gun Automobile Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army, was raised on 19 August 1914 on the basis of a training mobile company. It was already on the first weeks since the First World War began, and Russia's first armoured vehicles were a number of Russian-produced Russo-Balt armoured cars with British engines from the Austin Motor Company, the first ever to be produced in the country and the first also to see combat, marking the beginning of an era of armoured warfare in Russian lands. By 1917 and the aftermath of the February Revolution came yet another, the Austin- Putilov armored car, also produced with British support, which saw action in the war and in the events following the October Revolution. These two cars, by the time the Russian Civil War began in 1918, would form the Red Army's first ever armored components - a number of armored companies and battalions. Joined by captured Mark V tanks and a number of armored vehicles of both local and Western manufacture and trucks fitted with cannons and machine guns the small armored park grew on to form part of the growing force, with a seventeen Renault FT tanks - called the \\"Russian Reno\\", all remanufactured by the Krasnoye Sormovo Factory No. 112 in Nizhny Novgorod with a locally produced derivative, the \\"Freedom Fighter Lenin\\", the first true tank ever to be made - becoming thus the pioneer locally produced armoured vehicles produced by the young Russian military industry. Their appearances in all national parades in Red Square in Moscow beginning in 1921, alongside a number of foreign armoured vehicles made under license to assist the young army, showed the Soviet government's priorities on making armoured warfare part of the national strategy for the Soviet Armed Forces as a whole in its modernization and expansion to keep up with the times. The formation of the Tank Bureau under the People's Commisariat of Defence in 1924, with the existence of a armoured car battalion under the Technical Directorate of the WPRA (today the Main Agency of Automobiles and Tanks of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation) marked the formation of the modern day Tank Troops, which would materialize in the raising in the summer of 1929 within the Moscow Military District of the first ever Soviet mechanized regiment, the Joint Mechanized Regiment.История танковых войск Советской Армии. под. ред. О. А. Лосика. М. Свирин. Танковая мощь СССР With its T-18 tanks, the first to be designed by Russians, among its inventory of equipment, the regiment's tank battalion was but the first of many to be raised in the coming years. == Organization == At the time of the Fall of the Soviet Union there were five tank divisions stationed on the territory of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic: the 1st Tank Division (Kaliningrad), the 4th Guards Tank Division; the 5th Guards Tank Division; the 21st Guards Tank Division; and the 40th Guards Tank Division (Sovetsk).Feskov et al 2013. In September 1993 the 1st Tank Division became the 2nd Tank Brigade; then a weapons and equipment storage base in 1998; and then, finally, was disbanded in 2008. In the twenty- first century, a tank brigade is the second largest, after the tank division, of the formations of the Russian Tank Troops. According to the shtat (Table of Organization and Equipment), on average, there are about two to three thousand personnel in a tank brigade. In the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation the specified tank brigade commander's rank is colonel (major general being the minimum for a division). There are also a number of MBT battalions in the motorized rifle brigades and independent battalions. Today the formations of the Tank Troops include:  Divisional and corps regiments  * 11th Tank Regiment of the 11th Army Corps/Ground and Coastal Defence Forces of the Baltic Fleet (Gusev, Kaliningrad Oblast) - established by January 2019. * 12th Guards Tank Regiment of the 4th GTD (Naro-Fominsk) * 13th Guards Tank Regiment of the 4th GTD, (Naro-Fominsk) * 68th Guards Tank Regiment of the 150th Motor Rifle Division, (Persianovsky) * 237th Tank Regiment of the 3rd Motor Rifle Division (Valuyki) * 239th Guards Tank Regiment of the 90th Guards Tank Division (Chebarkul) * 6th Guards Tank Regiment of the 90th GTD (Chebarkul) * 80th Tank Regiment of the 90th GTD (Chebarkul) * 163rd Guards Tank Regiment of the 150th MRD (Persianovsky) * 228th Tank Regiment of the 144th Guards Motor Rifle Division (Yelnya, Yelninsky District, Smolensk Oblast)  Brigades  * 1st Guards Tank Brigade of the 20th Guards Army, (Boguchar) * 5th Separate Guards Tank Brigade of the 36th Army (Ulan-Ude) * 6th Tank Brigade of the 1st Guards Tank Army (Mulino) == References  Further reading == *V.I.

It is a photodetector that is used to sense the amount of ambient light present, and appropriately dim the device's screen to match it. This avoids having the screen be too bright when the user's pupils are adapted for vision in a dark room, or too dim when the device is used outdoors in the daytime. Dimming the screen on a mobile device also prolongs the lifetime of the battery. The standard international unit for the illuminance of ambient light is the lux. The typical performance of an ambient light sensor is from less than 50 lux in dim light to over 10,000 lux at noon. There are three common types of ambient light sensor: phototransistors, photodiodes, and photonic integrated circuits, which integrate a photodetector and an amplifier in one device.

It was originally thought to be a potent antiandrogen, but subsequent research found that it actually possesses dose-dependent androgenic activity, albeit with lower efficacy than dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The drug is an N-substituted arylthiohydantoin and was derived from the first-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) nilutamide. The second-generation NSAAs enzalutamide, RD-162, and apalutamide were derived from RU-59063. RU-59063 has high affinity for the human androgen receptor (AR) (Ki = 2.2 nM; Ka = 5.4 nM) and 1,000-fold selectivity for the AR over other nuclear steroid hormone receptors, including the , , , and . It shows 3- and 8-fold higher affinity than testosterone for the rat and human AR, respectively, and up to 100-fold higher affinity for the rat AR than the first-generation NSAAs flutamide, nilutamide, and bicalutamide. It also has slightly higher affinity for the AR than DHT and nearly equal affinity to that of the very-high-affinity AR ligand metribolone (R-1881). In addition, RU-59063, unlike testosterone and DHT, shows no specific binding to human plasma. ==See also== * Cyanonilutamide * RU-58642 * RU-58841 ==References *Sarms & Bodybuilding Category:Abandoned drugs Category:Primary alcohols Category:Imidazolidines Category:Ketones Category:Nitriles Category:Selective androgen receptor modulators Category:Thioureas Category:Trifluoromethyl compounds ","title":"RU-59063"},{"id":"56054678","text":"\\"Bipp\\" (stylized as \\"BIPP\\") is a song by Scottish, LA-based producer Sophie.

For the rest of the 1970s, she played only representative tennis for South Korea. She was a foundation player in South Korea's Fed Cup team, first featuring in its tournament debut in 1973, with regular appearances from 1976. At the 1974 Asian Games, she partnered with Lee Soon-oh to win a silver medal in the women's doubles. She won two gold medals at the 1978 Asian Games in both the women's singles and doubles. Relocating to the United States, Lee became the first South Korean of either gender to play professional tennis in 1980. She featured in the singles draw of all four grand slam tournaments in 1980, which was also a first for a Korean. At the 1981 US Open, she lost in the fourth round to Hana Mandlikova after defeating Susan Leo, Susan Mascarin and ninth-seed Virginia Ruzici. In 1982, she defeated Yvonne Vermaak to win the Fort Myers WTA tournament and had a win over Billie Jean King en route to the quarterfinals of the German Open. She reached her career best ranking of 47 in the world in 1983, which was her final year on the professional tour. This remained the highest rank attained by a Korean female player for 20 years until surpassed by Cho Yoon-jeong. ==WTA Tour finals== Singles (1-0) {class=\\"sortable \\" !Result !Date !Tournament !Tier !Surface !Opponent !class=\\"unsortable\\"Score -  98FB98;\\" Win  January, 1982  Fort Myers, Florida, U.S.  $50,000  Hard  Yvonne Vermaak  6–0, 6–3 } ==References* Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:South Korean female tennis players Category:Asian Games medalists in tennis Category:Asian Games gold medalists for South Korea Category:Asian Games silver medalists for South Korea Category:South Korean emigrants to the United States Category:Sportspeople from North Jeolla Province Category:Tennis players at the 1974 Asian Games Category:Tennis players at the 1978 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 1974 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 1978 Asian Games ","title":"Lee Duk-hee"},{"id":"56054708","text":"The 1995 GP Ouest-France was the 59th edition of the GP Ouest-France cycle race and was held on 27 August 1995.

In 1953, elections were held for the Mayor of Auckland plus other local government positions including twenty-one city councillors. The polling was conducted using the standard first-past-the-post electoral method. ==Background== Long serving incumbent mayor John Allum was successfully challenged by former magistrate John Luxford. Allum was the first mayor in the 20th century who had stood for re-election unsuccessfully. Luxford was endorsed by the new United Independents electoral ticket who gained the balance of power between the Labour Party and Citizens & Ratepayers, costing the latter the majority they had held since 1938. A major talking point in the lead up to the election was the potential of a clash with the 1953 Royal Tour. There were proposals to postpone local elections until early 1954 over fears of reduced turnout due to a conflicted schedule. The proposals were considered by the Minister of Internal Affairs William Bodkin, who ultimately decided against it. ==Mayoralty resultsCouncillor resultsNotesReferences== * Category:Mayoral elections in Auckland Category:1953 elections in New Zealand Category:Politics of the Auckland Region Category:1950s in Auckland ","title":"1953 Auckland City mayoral election"},{"id":"56054758","text":"Rosalind Franklin and DNA is a biography of an English chemist Rosalind Franklin (1920–1958) written by her American friend Anne Sayre in 1975. Franklin was a physical chemist who made pivotal research in the discovery of the structure of DNA, known as \\"the most important discovery\\" in biology. DNA itself had become \\"life's most famous molecule\\". While working at the King's College London in 1951, she discovered two types of DNA called A-DNA and B-DNA. Her X-ray images of DNA indicated helical structure. Her X-ray image of B-DNA (called Photo 51) taken in 1952 became the best evidence for the structure of DNA. For the discovery of the correct chemical structure of DNA, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1962 was shared by her colleagues and close researchers James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins; she died four years earlier in 1958 making her ineligible for the award. ==Background== Rosalind Franklin joined King's College London in January 1951 to work on the crystallography of DNA. By the end of that year, she established two important facts: one is that phosphate groups, which are the molecular backbone for the nucleotide chains, lie on the outside (it was a general consensus at the time that they were at the inside); and the other is that DNA exists in two forms, a crystalline (dry form) A-DNA and a hydrated (wet form) B-DNA. With her PhD student Raymond Gosling, she produced a series of X-ray images of DNA. The photograph (number 51, hence, popularised as Photo 51) of B-DNA taken in May 1952 was especially crucial. X-ray crystallography did not immediately show the precise helical structure. Franklin chose to work on A-DNA, while B-DNA was given to Maurice Wilkins. By the early 1953, Franklin was aware that both A and B forms of DNA were composed of two helical chains. By then, James Watson and Francis Crick at Cambridge University had built a correct double helical model of DNA, based on her experimental data. The discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 is regarded as \\"the greatest and most important scientific discovery of the 20th Century\\". Francis Crick, James Watson and Maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for the discovery. This discovery laid the foundation for modern biology, including medical and molecular research. The discoverers earned lasting worldwide fame. But the contribution made by Rosalind Franklin, who died in 1958, was largely forgotten. The main motive for Sayre's book came from James Watson's memoir The Double Helix : A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA. Published in 1968, The Double Helix reflected the account of the discovery in which Franklin was portrayed as \\"uninteresting\\", \\"belligerent\\", and \\"sharp, stubborn mind\\", referring her as \\"Rosy\\", the name she did not want to be called. Watson described her as having \\"all the imagination of English blue-stocking adolescents\\", and \\"the product of an unsatisfied mother\\". As a close friend of Franklin, Sayre realised that Watson's portrayal of Franklin was negative and referred to it as an \\"every known prejudice against intellectual women\\". She set a project for writing about Franklin's life and contribution to science. After researching for five years, she published the book in 1975, which she claimed was not a biography, but a protest to Watson's account. It is these two books which brought Franklin to fame. Sayre first met Franklin in 1949 at Laboratoire Central des Services Chimiques de l'État in Paris, where Franklin and her husband were post-doctoral researchers. They frequently met in England after Franklin moved there. In the US also, Franklin visited her several times upon attending scientific conferences. They regularly exchanged letters. Sayre was particularly important during the last days of Franklin. Franklin developed ovarian cancer in 1957 and underwent surgical operation in London. Sayre stayed with Franklin at the hospital and looked after Franklin's apartment. After Franklin's discharge from hospital, she nursed her in a rented cottage for some days. Back in New York in October, Sayre received a letter from Franklin stating that Franklin was to visit her on the way to a conference at Bloomington, Indiana. They never met—Franklin's condition deteriorated and she died on 16 April 1958. ==Criticism== Sayre's book gave Franklin an important place in the history of science, as a major contributor to the discovery of the structure of DNA. However, the book is written from a strong feminist standpoint, portraying Franklin as an icon of the movement, and allegedly misrepresenting the nature of sexism at the time. Sayre claimed that \\"in 1951 ... King's College as an institution, was not distinguished for the welcome that it offered to women ... Rosalind ... was unused to purdah [a religious and social institution of female seclusion] ... there was one other woman scientist on the laboratory staff\\". However, Farooq Hussain has noted that \\"there were seven women in the biophysics department ... Jean Hanson became an FRS, Dame Honor B. Fell, Director of Strangeways Laboratory, supervised the biologists\\". Another Franklin biographer, Brenda Maddox, agrees, declaring: \\"Randall ... did have many women on his staff ... they found him ... sympathetic and helpful.\\" Sayre also said that \\"while the male staff at King's lunched in a large, comfortable, rather clubby dining room\\" the female staff of all ranks \\"lunched in the student's hall or away from the premises\\". However, Lynne Osman Elkin has asserted that most of the MRC group (including Franklin) typically ate lunch together in the mixed dining room discussed below. Maddox has concurred, asserting that Randall \\"liked to see his flock, men and women, come together for morning coffee, and at lunch in the joint dining room, where he ate with them nearly every day.\\" Francis Crick also remarked that \\"her colleagues treated men and women scientists alike.\\" Sayre also claimed that Franklin's father, Ellis, objected to his daughter's higher education. That has led to accusations of sexism in Ellis Franklin's attitude to Rosalind, as well as the allegation that he strongly opposed her entering Newnham College. Her sister, Jenifer Glynn, has maintained that those stories are myths, and that her parents fully supported Franklin's entire career. Glynn has accused Sayre of making her sister a feminist heroine, and called Rosalind Franklin and DNA \\"the start of what has become something of a 'Rosalind Industry'.\\" She has argued that declaring Franklin to be a feminist symbol would have \\"embarrassed her [Rosalind Franklin] almost as much as Watson's account would have upset her\\", and maintains that her sister \\"was never a feminist.\\" Crick, and Franklin's close friend Aaron Klug, have agreed that Franklin was definitely not a feminist. ==See also== *Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA ==References== Category:1975 non-fiction books Category:Science bibliographies Category:DNA Category:Books about scientists ","title":"Rosalind Franklin and DNA"},{"id":"56054764","text":"Oleksandr Semenovych Presman (, b, April 10, 1961, Kyiv; Ukraine) — is a Ukrainian politician.

There is also a complementary scale - pEDA. The more positive is the value of sEDA the more sigma-electron donating is a substituent. The more negative sEDA, the more sigma-electron withdrawing is the substituent (see the table below). The sEDA parameter for a given substituent is calculated by means of quantum chemistry methods. The model molecule is the monosubstituted benzene. First the geometry should be optimized at a suitable model of theory, then the natural population analysis within the framework of Natural Bond Orbital theory is performed. The molecule have to be oriented in such a way that the aromatic benzene ring lays in the xy plane and is perpendicular to the z-axis. Then, the 2s, 2px and 2py orbital occupations of ring carbon atoms are summed up to give the total sigma system occupation. From this value the sum of sigma-occupation for unsubstituted benzene is subtracted resulting in original sEDA parameter. For sigma-electron donating substituents like -Li, -BH2, -SiH3, the sEDA parameter is positive, and for sigma-electron withdrawing substituents like -F, -OH, -NH2, -NO2, -COOH the sEDA is negative. The sEDA scale was invented by Wojciech P. Oziminski and Jan Cz. Dobrowolski and the details are available in the original paper. The sEDA scale linearly correlates with experimental substituent constants like Taft- Topsom σR parameter. For easy calculation of sEDA the free of charge for academic purposes written in Tcl program with Graphical User Interface AromaTcl is available.

This device could inject an almost sinusoidal voltage in series with the line. This injected voltage could be considered as an inductive or capacitive reactance, which is connected in series with the transmission line. This feature can provide controllable voltage compensation. In addition, SSSC is able to reverse the power flow by injecting a sufficiently large series reactive compensating voltage. ==See also== * Active power filter * Static synchronous compensator * Dynamic voltage restoration ==References== Category:Electric power transmission Category:Power engineering Category:Power electronics ","title":"Static synchronous series compensator"},{"id":"56054890","text":"The 1960 Chinese Mount Everest expedition was the first to successfully ascend Mount Everest via the North Ridge. Three members of the Chinese Everest Expedition Team, Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo, and Qu Yinhua reached the summit at 4:20 a.m., 25 May. The expedition left no photographic evidence at the summit, and was originally met with skepticism in the West. However, the international mountaineering community has generally acknowledged the result as more evidence has been revealed. ==Preparation== In 1955, four athletes, led by Xu Jing, went to Soviet Transcaucasia to study mountaineering with an invitation from the Soviet Union. In 1957, six mountaineers, including Shi Zhanchun and Liu Lianman, summited Minya Konka, setting a domestic mountaineering record. The same year, the Soviet Union suggested to the Chinese Government that a Sino-Soviet joint climbing team should be formed for Mount Everest. The expedition was originally set for May 1959, but had to be postponed to 1960 due to the 1959 unrest in Tibet. Meanwhile, a 380 km-long road was built from Shigatse to Everest Base Camp, and a weather station was established. By 1960, however, Sino-Soviet split made a joint expedition impossible, and the Soviet Union team retracted all their equipment. The Chinese Government allocated 700,000 US dollars of foreign exchange to purchase mountaineering equipment from Switzerland. The total cost was comparable to that of the 1st National Games of China. At this time, summiting Mount Everest was designated as a \\"national task\\" for the upcoming China-Nepal border negotiations, as the status of Mount Everest was still disputed. In February 1960, the Chinese Everest Team, with 214 members, was formed. Han Fudong, leader of the \\"hero regiment\\" from Chinese Civil War Battle of Tashan, was appointed as director. Shi Zhanchun and Xu Jing was team leader and deputy leader, respectively. ==Acclimatization expeditions== On 3 March 1960, the team of 192 members arrived at Everest Base Camp. They moved several tonnes of equipment to the Camp and set up Camp 1-3 at the base of East Rongbuk Glacier (5400 m), central part of the glacier (5900 m), and under the North Col (6400 m), respectively. On 19 March, the main members of the climbing team arrived at the Base Camp. On 25 March, the first acclimatization expedition was launched. The team moved equipment to Camp 3 and found a route pass the North Col. In the second expedition of 6 April, 4th Camp at 7007 m was set up. On 29 April, a third acclimatization expedition with the task of setting an Advance Camp at 8500 m was launched. The team encountered strong winds and only arrived at 7600 m in the next evening. In the evening of 2 May, Shi Zhanchun, Xu Jing, members Lhakpa Tsering and Migmar set off to chart a route and ascended to 8100 m. However, the transport team failed to catch up. The two Tibetan members returned to 7600 m, and Lhakpa Tsering climbed back to 8100 m with three transport team members, including Gonpo. While Lhakpa Tsering left to set a camp at 8100 m, Shi Zhanchun continued to climb the Second Step, and selected a route to the summit. After the third expedition, more than 50 team members, including Shi Zhanchun, suffered from frostbite and had to quit. In Beijing, Marshal He Long was following the team's progress and instructed the team to summit despite all costs. On 17 May, the final expedition was launched. In the afternoon, 23 May, Xu Jing, Wang Fuzhou, Liu Lianman and Gonpo set up the Advance Camp at 8500 m. Qu Yinhua and the transport team also arrived at the camp. ==Final expedition== The 4-member-team set off at 9 a.m., 24 May. Soon, Xu Jing was exhausted and had to be replaced by Qu Yinhua. At 12 p.m., they arrived at the Second Step. After several unsuccessful attempts to climb over the Step's last section, Liu Lianman, who was previously a fireman, suggested a \\"human ladder\\". Qu Yinhua removed his shoes and socks, and stood on Liu Lianman's shoulder to fix ice picks and safety ropes. They climbed over the Second Step at 5 p.m. With Liu Lianman remaining at a cave under the cliff, Wang Fuzhou led the other team members to continue ascending. Their oxygen was used up at 8800 m. At 4:20 a.m., 25 May, they arrived at the summit. The three members remained at the summit for 15 minutes, and left a 20 cm tall statue of Mao Zedong, a national flag, and a paper note. The team retreated to 8500 m at 9 p.m., and then to 6400 m on 28 May. By 30 May, all members had retreated to the Base Camp. The celebration ceremony was held at the Base Camp on 1 June. Qu Yinhua lost all 10 toes and right index finger to frostbite. ==Reaction== The expedition had no photographic evidence at summit as the team ascended at night. The team members were only able to record the final expedition at dawn, when they had already retreated to . The plaster statue of Mao Zedong was gone by the time of the 1963 American expedition, too. Therefore, the news was originally met with suspicion in the West. However, evidences had persuaded many international mountaineers that the team indeed reached the summit. Most notably, features recorded in the 1960 expedition report, including details of the Third Step and terrain near the summit, matched with later summit attempts from the north side. Climbing without oxygen, which was previously regarded as impossible, is also increasingly common. ==References== Category:Mount Everest expeditions Category:1960 in China Category:Mountaineering in China Category:1960 in Tibet ","title":"1960 Chinese Mount Everest expedition"},{"id":"56054931","text":"Bang Si-hyuk is a South Korean composer, music producer and record executive.

Saint Edeyrn and his associate Saint Isan were amongst the missionaries sent by Saint Teilo to perform this work. Isan founded the church in what is now Llanishen with Edeyrn. Edeyrn later founded a religious community on the banks of the Rhymney River (then Renis River). He is reputedly buried in the churchyard. ==Later history== After the Norman Conquest, the church was rebuilt and became a chapel of ease to St Mary's. In the 12th Century, it was recognised as the property of Tewkesbury Abbey, though returned to the Bishop of Llandaff in 1236, at which time it became a separate parish. The large Perpendicular windows were added in , and the tower soon after. Five of the bells which the tower currently houses date from 1766. An extensive restoration occurred in 1888 when the east chancel wall was completely rebuilt. ==Twentieth century== The church was transferred to the new Diocese of Monmouth after the creation of the Church in Wales. It is currently in the Cyncoed Ministry Area, which it shares with All Saints (Cyncoed), All Saints (Llanedeyrn) and St David's (Pentwyn).The church gained listed status in 1963, after which the machine-made tiles of the roof were replaced with Welsh slate. An additional bell was acquired in 1994. ==References== Category:Grade II* listed churches in Cardiff St Mellons ","title":"St Edeyrn's Church"},{"id":"56054987","text":"Marina Rice Bader is a writer, director, and film producer. She is known for the films Anatomy of a Love Seen (2014), Raven's Touch (2015), and Ava's Impossible Things (2016). She was executive producer for Elena Undone (2010) and A Perfect Ending (2012). She started the Soul Kiss Films production company in 2009. She champions the LGBTQ+ community, saying \\"We could use more films with well-rounded LGBTQ+ characters, and I hope in some way I’m helping to address that issue.\\" == Moviemaking == Until Bader was in her 50s, she had never been \\"in love with a woman before, never even kissed a woman. So, when you are walking into an entirely new world, you do your research by watching movies,\\" she said. That was when she saw the need for good lesbian movies: \\"I rented so many lesbian movies that I noticed there were some really good ones but also some terrible ones because of the lack of chemistry between the actors.\\" The first movie she made was with film director Nicole Conn, based loosely on their love story and remade into Elena Undone. On promoting the LGBTQ+ community, she says, \\"We can’t all be Shonda Rhimes, but we can sure as heck do our best to serve the communities we’re part of to make a difference that begins a ripple that will become a full-blown wave of change.\\" She considers as allies people like Joss Whedon, who create \\"vibrant, well-rounded female characters\\" — and companies like Vimeo, which launched its \\"Share the Screen\\" initiative at Sundance in 2013 to support emerging female voices in film. Another ally is Outfest Los Angeles, she says, an LGBT festival that programmed dozens female-directed projects in 2013. Bader has attempted to crowdfund her movies, but without much success. \\"As a filmmaker who’s giving so much time and energy to the whole thing, you want that to be your investment. You don’t want to have to freaking cash out your IRA to make a lesbian movie when there’s so many lesbians who are wanting content.\\" Nonetheless, she says, \\"I don’t understand why all lesbians don’t donate $10 for me to make a movie. But they don’t, so I’ve kind of come to the realization that I’m not going to be able to create film for my community based on support from my community, and it’s really heartbreaking.\\" == Personal life == Marina has four children, two cats, one dog and currently resides in Los Angeles. == See also == * List of female film and television directors * List of lesbian filmmakers * List of LGBT-related films directed by women == References  External links == * * * Category:Living people Category:Canadian film directors Category:Canadian film producers Category:Canadian screenwriters Category:Canadian women film directors Category:Canadian women film producers Category:Canadian women screenwriters Category:Lesbian artists Category:Lesbian writers Category:LGBT directors Category:LGBT producers Category:LGBT screenwriters Category:LGBT writers from Canada Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Marina Rice Bader"},{"id":"56054992","text":"Leonid Borisovich Lazebnik (; born January 11, 1941) is a Russian physician, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Professor at the Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry, President of the Gastroenterology Scientific Society of Russiahttp://www.gastrosphere.com/faculty.php.

It was like pulling teeth, which is among the reasons why we stopped writing together.\\" Parfitt sang lead and played rhythm guitar using an alternative tuning with the top and bottom strings retuned from E to B. He discovered the tuning while randomly playing around with the tuning pegs on his guitar after \\"a few glasses of wine\\". To get the required sound, he replaced the bottom string with a 60-gauge one from a bass guitar. The song features a time signature change from to partway through, before reverting to at the end. Jazz pianist John Mealing played as a guest on the track. Rossi later said it was one of his favourite Quo songs (along with Hello! as an album generally), as did Parfitt, who enjoyed the improvised jam at the end of the track and declared it his favourite guitar moment with the band. He recalled, \\"The amps were all around the room, and we just sat in a circle and vibed with each other. Nobody knew where anybody was gonna go, and in those days, you didn’t give a fuck about overspill, so the amps were cranked. It was magical\\". Of the title, Rossi remarked: \\"Rick and I were in a Yankee phase at the time… In 'real' English it would've been called 'Four Thousand, Five Hundred Times' – which doesn't quite work, does it?\\" ==Release== The song was first released in 1973 as the last track on Hello!. When that album was reissued on compact disc in 1987, as a double set with the earlier Piledriver, \\"Forty Five Hundred Times\\" had to be dropped owing to space reasons. The original studio version has been included on several compilation albums. It was re-recorded for the album Rock 'til You Drop (1991). ==Live performances== The song was not performed live when Hello! was first released, but was introduced into the set around 1975. For concert performances, Parfitt used a custom Gibson SG tuned specifically for the song, leaving the bottom B string slightly flat. It was subsequently played frequently, extending in length to 17 minutes on 1977's Live!, recorded at the Glasgow Apollo. It was performed at the \\"Frantic Four\\" concerts in 2013 featuring original Quo members Rossi, Parfitt, Alan Lancaster and John Coghlan. A 20-minute version was performed at the NEC Arena in 1982 at a charity concert for The Prince's Trust, with Coghlan's replacement Pete Kircher reinterpreting the original drum parts. This rendition was subsequently released in the expanded version of the album Live at the N.E.C. in 2017. ==References * Lyrics from Status Quo official website Category:1973 songs Category:Songs written by Francis Rossi Category:Songs written by Rick Parfitt Category:Status Quo (band) songs ","title":"Forty Five Hundred Times"},{"id":"56055084","text":"Chibber is a surname.

This temple is believed to be older than the Venkateswara Shrine. ==Religious significance== As per legend, after saving the Earth from the demon Hiranyaksha, Vishnu's boar avatar Varaha stayed on this hill on the northern bank of Swami Pushkarini. Hence Tirumala Hills is also referred to as Adivarahakshetra. In the beginning of the present aeon Kaliyuga, Varaha donated land to another form of Vishnu - Venkateswara on his request. As a gratitude, Venkateswara offered first bell, puja and Naivedyam (food offering) to Varaha before they were offered to him. This is being followed as a tradition even today. Devotees are prescribed to have darshan (\\"sight\\") of Varaha before Venkateswara. It is believed that pilgrimage to Tirupati will not be complete without having darshan of Varaha. ==History== This temple was renovated by Pedda Tirumalacharya in the year 1535 AD. ==Administration== The temple is part of Tirumala Venkateswara Temple and is being administered by Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams. ==Architecture== The rock temple is situated in the Northern bank of Swami Pushkarini and is accessed from North Mada street of Venkateswara Temple. ==Poojas and Festivals== Daily rituals are held as per Vaikanasa Agama.

It was officially launched at the New Delhi World Book Fair, on 10 January 2018. Set against the backdrop of the Islamic State spreading its tentacles in India, it is a historical thriller and mystery novel where a 1,500-year-old verse composed by the Indian mathematician Aryabhata plays a crucial role in the deciphering of innumerable cryptic symbols, ancient signs, mysterious carpet motifs and a sinister plan to destabilize India. The story is \\"set in a time period which is very similar to ours but with conspiratorial and complicated mysteries sprinkled into the ancestry of the main characters that have profound implications in shaping the history of mankind\\". It's an independent sequel to Sudipto's previous novel, The Ekkos Clan. == Author == The Aryabhata Clan is the second novel by Sudipto Das. An alumnus of IIT Kharagpur, a columnist, a TED speaker, and a musician too, Sudipto is a veteran in the semiconductor Industry and takes deep interest in Internet of things and artificial intelligence. He is a successful entrepreneur, having co-founded two successful startups. The founding member of the band Kohal, Sudipto is also the General Secretary of the Sarathi Socio Cultural Trust, which has been successfully involved in various socio-cultural activities in Bangalore for fifteen years. == Plot == The Aryabhata Clan is set in 2010, nearly two decades after The Ekkos Clan that unfolded in the 1990s. The Islamic State is slowly but surely making forays into the spheres of academia, media and politics in India. The mastermind Shamsur Ali, a physicist from Bangladesh, wants to destabilize India by creating a sort of apocalypse. And it's all up to the beautiful and spirited 20-year-old Kubha to prevent this at any cost. The crux of the novel is a diabolical plan to legitimize the demolition of one of the most prominent historical structures in India. Afsar Fareedi, a linguistic paleontologist and the main protagonist of The Ekkos Clan, catches the fraud. Amid all this mayhem, there are three gruesome murders, including that of her father, perhaps to eliminate all traces of a carpet, which Afsar discovers, has a lot hidden in its mysterious motifs, and which incidentally her father had a hand in making. Chilling murders, mysterious carpet motifs, cryptic symbols, thousand years old manuscripts, and at the center of all is a verse composed by the maverick mathematician Aryabhata 1,500 years ago - the key to solving all the mysteries. But, \\"the central crisis that needs to be averted in the present is far more intricate than the historic riddle that needs to be resolved\\".  Background  Sudipto \\"pulls together the mysteries found in Iranian carpet motifs, a 1500-year-old verse by Indian mathematician Aryabhata, and cryptic symbols from ancient languages, and manuscripts to come up with a compelling argument about the inherent falseness of any kind of cultural demolition based on exclusion.\\" In a blog Sudipto has mentioned that one of the inspirations behind writing The Aryabhata Clan was to \\"talk about some of [the] unusual ways and media which play a big role in informally chronicling\\" the history of our country. Sudipto has argued that the dominance of the leftist narrative for many years, since the independence of India, on academia and many aspects of art and culture has resulted in a serious problem in writing, teaching and learning history in India. Disastrously, it has suppressed the rightist narrative for too long, resulting in the recent times in the latter's sudden outburst and drastic efforts at creating a counter narrative, which more often than not is also not very authentic. Sudipto feels The Aryabhata Clan was an \\"attempt at retelling history as authentically as possible, without being driven by any agenda, either the leftist or rightist\\". The mathematician Aryabhata plays a pivotal role in the novel. Sudipto wanted to write about the enigmatic Aryabhata because he believes \\"in many ways Aryabhata is perhaps one of the earliest and greatest Indian exports to the world, in such a mammoth scale, in the global sense, per se.\\" The Aryabhata Clan also deals with Linguistics, Linguistic Paleontology, Digital Paleography, Epigraphy, Archaeology, Music, and many other diverse disciplines. == Reviews == # “A very readable sequel to The Ekkos Clan. Sudipto Das is a gifted storyteller,” said the reputed columnist Jug Suraiya. #\\"An ambitious piece of fiction... Designed a lot like The Da Vinci Code,\\" said The Times of India. # “Intelligent narration and mindful suspense,\\" said the Deccan Chronicle. # \\"The author rehashes his ability to spin extravagant plots that originate in the infancy of civilization with a winding path to an explosive resolution in the modern day,\\" commented The Hans India in its review. # \\"A spirited 20-year-old woman... and the onus is on her to save India from an impending apocalypse,\\" said Asian Age about the main protagonist Kubha. In a separate review, it said, The Aryabhata Clan \\"unearths, layer by layer through controlled suspense, a narrative of its own.\\" # \\"A woman Indiana Jones or a Bond, working through a Da Vinci Code-like theme with history deeply woven into a contemporary thriller,\\" pointed out The Hindu. # \\"The author spins a thrilling yarn... sends chills down your spine,\\" extolled The New Indian Express. #\\"Gory, frightening and lunatic, the terror protagonist of the author will make you tremble at the sheer thought of waging a brutal war against the world in the name of fighting for peace,\\" said Business Standard, in a review. #\\"This twisted tale of terror and violence lays bare the failure of extreme religious ideology in the face of false superiority,\\" said Millennium Post, in a review. #\\"Born out of the experiences derived from the various lanes and by- lanes of his life, this novel of Sudipto's would definitely give unadulterated happiness to the readers,\\" asserted the Bengali fortnightly Unish-Kuri. #\\"Full of excitement, The Aryabhata Clan is taut in building the story and the selection of its characters,\\" said the Bengali daily Bartaman in its review of the novel. == Criticism == Almost everyone has unanimously acknowledged that Sudipto's \\"familiarity with linguistics, linguistic paleontology, archetypes, digital paleography, epigraphy, archaeology, symbolism and music [is] impressive.\\" But the heavy research, many felt, \\"make[s] the novel read more like [a] lesson in inductive reasoning at times. Another thing [that] weighs the novel down is a tendency towards verboseness.\\" \\"The book would probably make for an informative read,\\" commented a reviewer, \\"but it just took away the hook and pace of a thriller.\\" The Bengali daily Bartaman found the language of the novel \\"wrapped in an Indian mold\\" a little too much. The critic found the \\"tight excitement losing to the language\\" at times. Referring to \\"the oft repeated, misplaced references to the history of Islam\\" in the book, a reviewer felt, \\"had the author not amplified the canvas of his narrative to encompass Islamic Terrorism, we surely would have a plot for another James Bond blockbuster.\\" == In Media ==  Print & Online  #Business Standard, 2 September 2018: Review, \\"The author takes the reader on a roller coaster ride to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan and to the motifs of Khushawari rugs.\\" #The Times of India, 11 August 2018: Feature, A potpourri of action, suspense, conflict and politics, \\"Set against the global terrorism perpetrated by the Islamic State and their affiliates...

The story is told through the voice of May Shigenobu, daughter of the founder of the Japanese Red Army, who lived a clandestine life in Lebanon until the age of 27, and Masao Adachi, a Japanese experimental film director who joined the Japanese Red Army in Beirut. The film puts into practice the \\"landscape theory\\" (fûkeiron in Japanese) developed by Masao Adachi, which proposes to turn the camera not towards the subject of the film but towards the landscapes in which the subject has lived. The film premiered at FID Marseille film festival. The collaboration between Baudelaire and Masao Adachi gave away to a second film, The Ugly One, in 2013, based on a screenplay Baudelaire commissioned from Adachi. Adachi, who is forbidden from leaving Japan, sent a few pages of the script to Baudelaire, in Beirut, each morning of the film shoot. The film premiered in competition at the Locarno Film Festival and was shown as an installation at the 2014 Yokohama Triennial. Baudelaire returned to Abkhazia in 2014 for his third feature, Letters to Max. The film is based on a correspondence with former Abkhaz Foreign Minister Maxim Gvinjia, to whom Baudelaire sent a series of letters from Paris to test whether the French postal system would deliver mail to a state it doesn't recognize. Gvinjia received many of the letters, and responded with voice recordings that became the voiceover for the film. In 2015, Baudelaire organised the exhibition The Secession Sessions, which included Letters to Max, as well as a performance with Maxim Gvinjia titled The Abkhaz Anembassy, and a series of talks, lectures and workshops about the concepts of stateless statehood, nationalism and secessionism. The exhibition began at Bétonsalon, Paris, and travelled to Bergen Kunsthall, Norway, Berkeley Art Museum / Kadist San Francisco and Sharjah Biennial 12 where it won the prize. Baudelaire's fourth feature film, Also Known As Jihadi, 2017, retraces the itinerary of a young Frenchman who flew to Egypt in 2012 and eventually joined the ranks of the Al Nusra Front in Syria. The film is a loose remake of Masao Adachi's 1969 A.K.A. Serial Killer. Baudelaire departs from Adachi's original film, which was composed entirely of landscapes, by adding a narrative made up of legal documents from the investigation into the young man's activities (wiretap transcripts, police interrogation reports), displayed on-screen between the landscape shots. The film became the centrepiece of an exhibition at the Centre Pompidou, in Paris, titled APRÈS (After), in reference to the November 2015 Paris attacks. The film was installed among a broad selection of works chosen in the Pompidou Museum's collection, along with a program of daily screenings and public discussions. ==References== Category:American people of French descent Category:American filmmakers Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Artists from Salt Lake City Category:American expatriates in France Category:Brown University alumni ","title":"Éric Baudelaire"},{"id":"56055218","text":"} This is a list of electoral district results of the 2008 Western Australian election. == Results by Electoral district ==  Albany   Alfred Cove   Armadale   Balcatta   Bassendean   Bateman   Belmont   Blackwood-Stirling   Bunbury   Cannington   Carine   Central Wheatbelt   Churchlands   Cockburn   Collie-Preston   Cottesloe   Darling Range   Dawesville   Eyre   Forrestfield   Fremantle   Geraldton   Girrawheen   Gosnells   Hillarys   Jandakot   Joondalup   Kalamunda   Kalgoorlie   Kimberley   Kingsley   Kwinana   Mandurah   Maylands   Midland   Mindarie   Moore   Morley   Mount Lawley   Murray- Wellington   Nedlands   Nollamara   North West   Ocean Reef   Perth   Pilbara   Riverton   Rockingham   Scarborough   South Perth   Southern River   Swan Hills   Vasse   Victoria Park   Wagin   Wanneroo   Warnbro   West Swan   Willagee  == See also == * Results of the Western Australian state election, 2008 (Legislative Council) * 2008 Western Australian state election * Candidates of the Western Australian state election, 2008 * Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, 2008–2013 == References == Category:Results of Western Australian elections Category:2008 elections in Australia ","title":"Results of the 2008 Western Australian state election (Legislative Assembly)"},{"id":"56055219","text":"Manasuku Nachindi is a 2018 Telugu romantic drama film directed by debutante Manjula Ghattamaneni.

The introduction of parametric design to software for end-users greatly simplified making adjustments, as well as refitting an existing design to a completely different person. The support for over 50 pattern-making systems made the project somewhat popular with designers of contemporary clothes as well as the historical recreation community, since a significant part of the supported systems cover Victorian tailoring, as well as garment cutting from even earlier centuries. It was in the second half of 2017 when the project was divided into two separated projects. The results of such development (new forks) are named Valentina and Seamly2D.

It was registered with the Flag Institute in August 2016. The flag was registered as a result of a campaign that secured the support of a dozen county organisations plus the sanction of both the Lord Lieutenant and the High Sheriff. __TOC__ ==Design== The bear and ragged staff as depicted in John Speed's 1611 map of the county The design features the traditional bear and ragged staff used in the county since the Middle Ages as a symbol of the Earls of Warwick. The first recorded use of the two symbols was by the Beauchamp family, who became the Earls of Warwick in 1268, as a seal. They were initially used separately, and the earliest known appearance of them together was on a bed of black cloth embroidered with a gold bear and silver staff owned by Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick (1338–1401). The bear and ragged staff appear in the same arrangement as the flag in John Speed's 1611 map of the county. The current holders of the title of Earl of Warwick, the Greville family, were granted the symbol of their predecessors, a \\"bear erect argent, muzzled gules, supporting a ragged staff of the first\\", shortly after being given the title in 1759. This crest is still used by the earls today. Over the centuries, however, the design has also become associated with the wider county. For example, the 1st Warwickshire Militia regiment, first raised in 1759, used the symbol. Many other organisations in the county followed in adopting the bear and ragged staff, including Warwickshire Constabulary (established in 1857) and Warwickshire County Council (established in 1889). The design of the flag lacks the chains and the muzzle on the bear, commonly found in old depictions of the emblem. ==References *[ Flag Institute particulars] *Background on the Warwickshire flag Warwickshire Warwickshire Flag Flag Warwickshire Warwickshire ","title":"Flag of Warwickshire"},{"id":"56055285","text":"Rural Mount is a historic mansion in Morristown, Tennessee, U.S..

It is based on the true story of a British-Tanzanian man, Thomas McFadden, who was apprehended in 1996 at La Paz airport in Bolivia with five kilos of cocaine in his suitcase and incarcerated in San Pedro prison. The book, described as \\"a gripping expose of life inside\\" and \\"the current must- read on the gringo trail\\", was released in 2003 and became a bestseller and a cult classic, having sold over 600,000 copies. ==Background== Rusty Young, a twenty-four-year-old law graduate, was backpacking in South America when he heard about Thomas McFadden, a convicted English drug trafficker who ran tours inside Bolivia's famous San Pedro Prison. Curious about the reason behind McFadden's huge popularity, Young went to La Paz and joined one of Thomas's illegal tours. They formed an instant friendship and then became partners in an attempt to record Thomas's experiences in the jail. Rusty bribed the guards to allow him to stay and for the next three months he lived inside the prison, sharing a cell with Thomas. At one point Rusty was arrested, interrogated and ordered to leave the country. He did so briefly before returning and offered an even larger bribe to officials to let him continue his stay. Rusty has explained in interviews that what first attracted him to the idea of telling the story was Thomas's personality: \\"He was able to get through to people, make them feel safe immediately they were inside the prison, and make them want to come back. There were lots of tourists who had visited the week before who were coming back - people came back two or three times, not to do the tour again but just to talk to Thomas ... he had this unique charm.\\" ==Summary== Marching Powder tells Thomas's story from when he arranged what he believed to be a routine cocaine-smuggling operation using a trusted airport contact. However his contact sold him out, and Thomas was detained at the airport. The cocaine was so well-hidden in Thomas's suitcase that the authorities could not find it, and it was only at the insistence of his former contact that the airport security officers cut into the suitcase to find the drugs. After this, the book chronicles Thomas's difficulties with the Bolivian justice system, the corruption of the court process and how he was betrayed by his lawyers. It is only after he was actually incarcerated in San Pedro that things improved for him. On a chaperoned night away from the prison, for which Thomas had paid a large bribe, he befriended an Israeli backpacker and regaled her with stories of his life in San Pedro. She insisted on seeing it for herself, and after that word spread along the gringo trail and Thomas was able to start a tour business within the prison. As reported by the Guardian, \\"Some backpackers even stayed overnight to take advantage of the dirt-cheap cocaine produced in the prison's makeshift labs. San Pedro became known as the best all-night party place in town.\\" The book covers the first meeting of Rusty and Thomas. During the period Rusty was living in San Pedro to record Thomas's story, another inmate who owed Thomas money tried to set him up to be found in possession of drugs. Rusty, using his legal skills, posed as Thomas's \\"international human rights lawyer\\" and as a result Thomas was found innocent of these additional charges. Because his original sentence had already expired as he waited for the new case to be heard, this finding of innocence meant that Thomas was now free. After securing Thomas's release, Rusty and Thomas lived in Colombia where Rusty taught the English language and finished writing Thomas's story. Rusty has also stated that he helped Thomas readjust to living outside the prison. \\"We lived together for three months and I helped him basically readjust to normal living, having to deal with such normal, boring things as paying the bills, paying the rent, getting up in the morning at the same time.\\" ==Public Reception== Marching Powder was first published in Australia to positive reviews and soon afterwards in the United Kingdom and United States. Media reports and reviews centred on the unusual prison conditions outlined in the memoir and this fuelled its popularity. One reviewer summed up the position as follows: \\"It is hard for a Westerner to comprehend that these are actual events – the stories of violence, of endemic corruption and blatant unfairness, are so incredible, they seem to be a well written novel.\\" As reported by the BBC, \\"prisoners were expected to earn a living inside and buy their cells as if they were real estate. There was a primary school for the prisoners' children, who they brought to live with them, and in the most notorious twist of all, there was an in-house cocaine factory.\\" ==Subsequent Events== Thomas McFadden returned to the UK and painted houses for a living, before finally returning to his native Tanzania. Rusty has stated that he and Thomas have remained close friends, and that Thomas named his first son 'Rusty'. In 2015, Rusty and Thomas reunited and returned secretly to the prison to film a segment for Australia's Sunday Night program. A film adaptation of Marching Powder has been announced with little information released so far in regards to its production. Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment production company, Periscope Entertainment and Reason Pictures originally optioned the book and Don Cheadle was cast as Thomas McFadden. However subsequently the rights were acquired by New Regency and in June 2014 it was announced that Chiwetel Ejiofor would instead play McFadden. == References == Category:2003 non-fiction books Category:Australian non-fiction books Category:Macmillan Publishers books Category:Books about cocaine ","title":"Marching Powder (book)"},{"id":"56055303","text":"Leiopterella is a genus of prehistoric eurypterid of the family Rhenopteridae.

The England–Scotland Professional Match was held the following day with Open qualifying on the three days after that. Although Harry Vardon and James Braid were playing an exhibition match on the same day and J. H. Taylor and Arnaud Massy were absent, most of the other leading professionals competed, about 140 playing. In order for such a large field to play 36 holes in one day, a cut was used; only those scoring 75 or better in the first round being allowed to play in the second. Ted Ray won the tournament with rounds of 63 and 70, two ahead of Rowland Jones. Charles Mayo was third a further two shots behind, with George Duncan, Fred Leach and Robert Thomson tied for fourth. Ray scored a course record 63 in the morning round to lead by three from Jones. Ray had a bad front half of 38 in the afternoon but came home in 32. Jones, out in 36, was level with Ray at the turn but couldn't match him on the back-9 and finished two behind.

Three suspected militants, including Chatayev, and one counter-terrorist officer were killed and four law enforcement personnel were wounded as a result of about 20-hour confrontation. One member of the group was arrested. According to the Georgian security officials, the group planned to carry out terror attack against foreign diplomatic missions in Georgia and Turkey. == Siege == A special operation, involving the Georgian police and State Security Service, to disarm an armed group entrenched in a rented flat in a block in Gabriel Salos Street in Tbilisi's Isani district began late on 21 November and escalated to a gunfight and explosions overnight after hours of futile attempts by the authorities to convince the men to surrender. The fighting started when the suspects answered the authorities demands with heavy gun fire and tossing hand grenades at the security forces, wounding 5 officers, one of whom died later in hospital. In response the police moved in with armoured cars and subsequently stormed the apartment. The operation was over by 17:00 local time on 22 November. In what the Georgian officials declared to be an anti- terrorist operation, three suspected militants, all \\"foreign nationals\\", were killed and one, later confirmed to be a Russian citizen, arrested. Two of the suspects were shot by police when trying to escape. No civilian casualties occurred. One of the killed militants was later identified to have been Akhmed Chatayev, who reportedly blew himself up during the shootout. == Investigation == The government remained largely tightlipped after the operation and were criticized by the opposition for the lack of transparency. Chatayev, a former fighter in Chechnya, had been arrested in Georgia during the Lopota incident in 2012, but then released on bail and cleared of charges of possessing explosives on account of \\"insufficient evidence\\". He then emerged as a commander for the Islamic State in Syria and was designated by the United Nations as a \\"foreign terrorist\\". According to the head of the Georgian State Security Service Vakhtang Gomelauri, Chatayev and his associates made their way to Georgia in 2017, bypassing a border checkpoint, but declined to specify the country from which they crossed into Georgia. Gomelauri stated a weapons cache from which the group was supplied was found in the woods and that there were two versions regarding the group's planned activities in Georgia, without going into further details. The United States counter-terrorism experts were involved in the investigation. ==Perpetrators== One of the accused perpetrators, identified as \\"S.D.\\" by the Georgia's Chief Prosecutor's Office, was later confirmed to be Shoaif Borziev, a 23-year-old Russian citizen of Chechen origin, who was wanted by Russia through Interpol. One of the dead suspects was identified as Akhmed Chatayev, a Chechen ISIS recruiter, by the State Security Service of Georgia. The Georgian security officials came up with more details on 26 December, claiming the group planned terror attacks against foreign diplomatic missions in Georgia and Turkey and identifying the other two killed militants as Ibragim Adashev and Aslambek Soltakhmadov. The former had visited Georgia from 2010 to 2012 \\"with various fake passports\\". ==Aftermath== On 26 December, the Counter-Terrorism Department carried out a double operation in Tbilisi and the Pankisi Gorge in northeast Georgia, inhabited by the ethnic Kists, a Chechen subgroup. As a result, four men allegedly linked with Chatayev's group were arrested. In the course of the operation, an 18-year-old suspect from the Pankisi Gorge, Temirlan Machalikashvili, was severely wounded by a gunshot and died in a hospital on 12 January 2018. According to the security officials, the boy attempted to detonate a hand grenade as the security officers entered his house, but the Machalikashvili family denied this and claimed he was asleep when the officers opened fire. A Georgian man allegedly linked with \\"the Chatayev case\\" was also arrested by the Turkish police in Trabzon. On 27 July 2018, the Prosecutor's Office of Georgia stated the group and their accomplices arrived in Georgia to conduct terrorist acts in retaliation to the June 2015 arrest of Aiuf Borchashvili, a Pankisi gorge resident, on charges of recruiting locals for the ISIS. That day, the Tbilisi City Court ruled that Shoaif Borziev, Chatayev's number arrested during the Isani standoff, was guilty of plotting terrorist acts in Georgia and sentenced him to thirteen years in prison. Ruslan Shavadze, another member of the group, received the same sentence in absentia. He was detained in Georgia in August 2018. Four more men, all Georgian nationals, detained from December 2017 to January 2018, were found guilty of providing logistical support to the Chatayev group and sentenced from 10 to 12 years in prison. == References == Category:2017 in Georgia (country) Category:History of Tbilisi Category:Conflicts in 2017 Category:Terrorist incidents in Georgia (country) Category:Operations involving Georgian special forces Category:November 2017 events in Europe Category:November 2017 events in Asia Category:Terrorist incidents in Europe in 2017 Category:Terrorist incidents in Asia in 2017 Category:2017 crimes in Georgia (country) Category:2010s murders in Georgia (country) Georgia Georgia ","title":"2017 Isani flat siege"},{"id":"56055537","text":"Vernon Shelby Martin (January 5, 1932 – November 10, 2000) was an American jazz double bassist known for his work with Rahsaan Roland Kirk. ==Discography== ;As sideman *1962: Domino - Rahsaan Roland Kirk *1968: Left & Right - Rahsaan Roland Kirk *1969: Volunteered Slavery - Rahsaan Roland Kirk *1970: Rahsaan Rahsaan - Rahsaan Roland Kirk ==References== Category:1932 births Category:2000 deaths Category:American jazz double-bassists Category:Male double-bassists Category:People from Toledo, Ohio Category:Jazz musicians from Ohio Category:20th-century double-bassists Category:20th- century American male musicians Category:American male jazz musicians ","title":"Vernon Martin (jazz bassist)"},{"id":"56055551","text":"The 2003 GP Ouest-France was the 67th edition of the GP Ouest-France cycle race and was held on 24 August 2003.

Die Stadt und ihre Bauten The town hall in Freiburg im Breisgau is spread over a total of 16 locations. The three most important buildings are the Old Town Hall and the New Town Hall in the city center as well as the Technical Town Hall in the Stühlinger district. The oldest town hall in Freiburg is part of the building complex of the Old Town Hall. It is located in the inner courtyard and is now called Gerichtslaube (\\"court house\\") and is directly connected to the Old Town Hall. A passage from the New Town Hall to the Old Town Hall spans the Turmstraße between the two buildings. The three town halls form a complex, in which the three individual buildings are registered as monuments in the list of monuments of the country.City archive Freiburg: Verzeichnis der Baudenkmäler der Stadt Freiburg == Old Town Hall (Altes Rathaus) == Old Town Hall (2011) Coat of Arms on the gable The front's painting by Fritz Geiges At the beginning of the 14th century, the city of Freiburg already bought a building on Franziskanerplatz, today Rathausplatz, followed by two more adjoining buildings to establish the chancery of the town clerk. In the court documents from the years 1443 to 1479 a Richthaus (\\"court house\\") is mentioned, which was situated in these buildings. In 1557, master builder Dietrich Neeb and master mason Barthlin Ress were assigned by the council to build a new building on the property. This new building was extended in 1561 to the north by a building, followed in 1600 by another in the Turmstraße. Even though the buildings are united by a uniform facade, it is possible to distinguish between different construction phases. The building of 1557/1559 has an asymmetrical arrangement of the construction axes, which is still visible today. The ground floor has three entrances. The main portal on the right in the Renaissance style dates back to 1558. Two lions hold the coat of arms of Freiburg and the Bindenschild of Austria. On the far left, the former passage route framed by a Renaissance arch into the courtyard of the town hall serves as the main entrance to the building. Above the arch is a clock crowned by the Double-headed eagle of the Holy Roman Empire with the coats of arms of Hungary and Bohemia as well as under the Herzschild of Castile and Austria. More coats of arms on the gable over the main entrance remind of the different monarchs in Freiburg: The space in the top right contains the red eagle of the House of Zähringen (1091-1218). Next to it there is the lion of the counts of Urach, who took over the eagle of the Zähringer as well when they were counts of Freiburg. In the middle on the left, there is the State coat of arms of the Habsburg hereditary lands, the so-called Lerchenwappen, which features five eagles on a blue background that stand for five different duchies. The Habsburgs ruled in Freiburg from 1368 to 1806 (except for 1677 until 1697, when Freiburg was part of the Kingdom of France), which is symbolized by the Alsatian coat of arms in the middle on the right. At the lower left the shield of the House of Austria can be seen, to the right of it there is the coat of arms of Freiburg, the Saint George's Cross. The house facade of the old town hall was painted with scenes from a dance of death in 1559. At the behest of the council, the painter Galienus Entringer had to replace his own painting with a history painting with scenes from the life of Philip II of Macedon in 1560. In 1881, Fritz Geiges replaced the neo-Gothic architectural painting of Simon Gösers of 1810 with paintings in the manner of the Renaissance, but those had to be revised in 1886 because of damage. Today, the building is plastered uniformly in sandstone red. The windows are framed in black and gold with colorful portals.Hans Georg Wehrens: Der Totentanz im alemannischen Sprachraum. \\"Muos ich doch dran - und weis nit wan\\". Schnell & Steiner, Regensburg 2012, , p. 172.Peter Kalchthaler: Die historischen Rathäuser. Presse-und Informationsamt, Freiburg im Breisgau 1990. During Operation Tigerfish in 1944, the old town hall burned out completely and the entire interior decor was lost. Modern materials were used in the reconstruction of the building. The Old Town Hall was also extended by 3 wings in the plain functional style usual for that time. As a result of the new construction, only the nuns' undercroft of the convent of Poor Clares was preserved. This convent was housed in the former Regelhaus (a quasi-monastic building) Zum Lämmlein from 1672 until its abolition in 1782. After that, the buildings were used by the \\"Hospital of the Holy Spirit\\". == New Town Hall (Neues Rathaus) == Damaged figure (top) New Town Hall The origins of the New Town Hall can be traced back to a duplex house. The one on the right (Zum Rechen) was commissioned by the physician Joachim Schiller von Herdern and built between 1539 and 1545.Rolf Wilhelm Brednich: Zur Volkskunde des Landkreises in: Landkreis Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald (Hrsg.): Breisgau- Hochschwarzwald. Land vom Rhein über den Schwarzwald zur Baar, Karl Schillinger, Freiburg im Breisgau 1980, , p. 175. The university bought the adjacent house (Zum Phönix) and turned both houses into a complex of buildings. As assembly between the buildings a prestigious columned doorway decorated with pediments carrying the inscription Academia friburgensis had been chosen. This complex of buildings has served the university until 1774 as Collegium Universititas. After the abolishment of the Jesuit order, the university received new collegiate buildings in the Bertoldstraße. The administration department and three of four faculties (medicine not included) relocated there. Since then, the building was called Alte Universität (\\"Old University\\"), Altes Kollegium (\\"Old College\\") or Alte Anatomie (\\"Old Anatomy\\"). In 1867, the Faculty of Medicine moved to new buildings northwards where a new university quarter arose. In the early 18th century, the Auditorium maximum (the biggest lecture hall) had been created in the course of a renovation of the building's south wing. Due to its grand stucco ceiling, the auditorium is considered the most beautiful room in Freiburg which has been created during the baroque period. In 1779, another auditorium for anatomical lectures (Theatrum Anatomicum) had been created in the northern part of the building. After more than 300 years belonging to the university, the town purchased the building for 140 gold mark and finished its conversion into the New Town Hall in 1901. Reasons for this include lack of space and the historic preservation of a monument.Die Alte Universität, Peter Kalchthaler, Badische Zeitung, 2011-08-15, Retrieved 2012-06-25 In addition to that, the town wanted to prevent the demolition of the building and therefore real estate speculation. The transformation into the town hall was also linked to many changes to the substance of the building. A bay window-figure was frequently damaged by trucks and has been fully replaced in 2012.Face-Lifting am Rathaus statt Nasenkorrektur, Simone Lutz, Badische Zeitung, 2012-10-20, Retrieved 2012-10-22 Today, different theatrical performances take place in the courtyard of the new town hall in summer. == Gerichtslaube == The Gerichtslaube (court house) Lower hall The Gerichtslaube (\\"court house\\") is the oldest town hall in Freiburg. It is first documented in 1328 as a council building, but only since the 16th century identified as Gerichtslaube. The Gerichtslaube was destroyed in the air raid on Freiburg (Operation Tigerfish) of 1944 almost to the foundations, it remained only parts of the access staircase and the west wall, the annex which contained the archives, including the establishment of 1553 remained almost intact. From 1961, the reconstruction was run by the Kuratorium Gerichtslaube, a civic initiative and in March 1975, the reconstruction could be started according to the plans of the architect Gregor Schroeder. After the topping out ceremony in December 1975, it was solemnly inaugurated in June 1979. Another special feature is also here: on August 24, 1498 King Maximilian I had issued at the Freiburg Reichstag a wine Reinheitsgebot (Purity Law), which is older than the well- known purity law for beer from April 23, 1516. == References  Literature == * Rudolf Thoma: Das alte Rathhaus und die Universität.

He is the son of a motor mechanic father, grew up in York, and left Fulford Comprehensive at the age of 17. ==Career== After leaving school, Fairburn joined a two-year youth training scheme in York to become a quantity surveyor, working, and training for a Higher National Certificate (HNC) qualification at York Technical College. Fairburn joined Persimmon in 1989, becoming CEO in April 2013. As of December 2017, Fairburn had been a director of 305 UK companies. In December 2017, Persimmon's chairman, Nicholas Wrigley, resigned over his role in awarding Fairburn a bonus in the region of £100 million. The Persimmon bonus scheme is believed to be the UK's \\"most generous ever\\", and was scheduled to pay more than £500 million to 150 senior staff from 31 December 2016. In March 2017, Fairburn agreed to hand back £25 million of the bonus and set aside a \\"substantial portion\\" of the sum to charity, bringing the total payout to £75 million. In October 2018, he walked off camera during a BBC Look North interview, after his press officer objected to his being asked about the bonus. His parting words to the reporter were \\"I think that's very unfortunate actually that you've done that.\\" In November 2018, Persimmon asked Fairburn to leave the company. The controversy around Fairburn continued in November 2019 when Politicians and campaigners urged him to reveal whether he has donated a portion of his controversial £75m bonus as he promised, as it appears no charity has been set up in the former Persimmon boss's name. A year after he was forced to step down, the Charity Commission says it does not have any record of a trust bearing Mr Fairburn's name. Neither does it appear that the ex-housebuilding chief executive is a trustee of any charity in England or Wales.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/11/26/money- persimmons-75m-boss-jeff-fairburn-urged-reveal-charitable/ ==Personal life== Fairburn drives a Range Rover, enjoys Formula One racing, and his holiday destination of choice is Florida. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1966 births Category:British chief executives Category:People from York Category:Businesspeople from Yorkshire ","title":"Jeff Fairburn"},{"id":"56055681","text":"Dany Abounaoum (born 23 October 1969) is a Lebanese alpine skier.

The on-going profits of all five tracks only serviced the interest on the debt and it then emerged that a partner in the original GRA takeover with Risk was a company called Galliard Homes. This came to light after plans were drawn up by them to build houses on Wimbledon and Oxford Stadium to reduce the debt. The entire scenario was effectively a disaster for the greyhound industry with the leading greyhound track operator showing intent to end their role in the sport. Oxford Stadium closed on 29 December, a move regarded as an attempt by the GRA to force the local council into passing future planning submissions. Paschal Taggart owner of Shelbourne Park revealed plans to buy Wimbledon and redevelop it into a super stadium at a cost of £30 million. This was followed by an announcement from GRA Managing Director Clive Feltham supporting rival plans to end greyhound racing there and let AFC Wimbledon rebuild a football stadium with associated housing. Tracks Norah McEllistrim left Wimbledon for Hove, the McEllistrim ties with Wimbledon dated back to 1929. Brighton had been seeking a replacement for three time winner of the Trainers Championship Brian Clemenson who had announced his retirement. In addition to McEllistrim, the track would also recruit Dean Childs and Paul Garland. John Mullins returned to Yarmouth and Paul Sallis moved from Hall Green to Monmore. The GRA released the Grand National out of their control allowing Sittingbourne to host it. A bid by the well-known professional gambler and owner Harry Findlay to re-open Coventry finally went ahead after being licensed by the Greyhound Board of Great Britain. Kevin Boothby took over sole control of Henlow Stadium following Bob Morton's departure. Clonmel and Tralee earned contributions from the Irish Greyhound Board. Mystery surrounded the closure of independent track Westhoughton Greyhound Track near Bolton, just months before it was due to reopen following a £100,000 facelift. The stadium had undergone £30,000 improvements the previous year and a 20-year lease had been secured by a new owner, but work came to a halt and the site closed. Competitions The blue riband events, the 2012 English Greyhound Derby and 2012 Irish Greyhound Derby were won by Blonde Snapper and Skywalker Puma respectively; both went on to win the accolade greyhound of the year. Nick Savva claimed a surprise Trainers Championship success at Perry Barr; it was the fourth time he had secured the championship. The youngster Farloe Warhawk impressed during the Laurels winning the event unbeaten before being rested for the winter. The black dog also won the Puppy Derby in August pipping kennelmate Ballymac Eske. News The new Racing Post TV channel (RPGTV) started in February when it featured the heats of the Golden Jacket at Crayford Stadium. The channel had been set up in the partnership of Hills, Ladbrokes, Coral, bet365 and Betfair. Champion sprinter Jimmy Lollie was retired to stud in June after finishing lame at Hove.

Closely linked to the Liberal Party, Drake became senator in 1891 and deputy in 1898, being an active member of the Senate's and the Congress' committees regarding public works and infrastructure in Puerto Rico and Peninsular Spain. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic and made Maestrante of Seville. == Background and family (1855-1893) == Emilio was born in January 1855 into a wealthy aristocratic family. His father, Carlos Guillermo Drake y Núñez del Castillo, Count of Vega Mar and Viscount of Escambray, was the son of a wealthy Englishman, James Ash Drake, who had made his fortune on the Spanish island colony of Cuba in the late eighteenth century. His mother, Carlota, was part of the island's aristocracy (her father was the Marquess of San Felipe y Santiago and later Count of Castillo, Grandee of Spain). In the early 1800s, after the independence of Spanish American possessions, the family emigrated to the Peninsula and settled in Madrid. Carlos married Virginia De la Cerda y Gand-Villain-Rochefoucauld de Bayers, member of the House of De La Cerda, one of Spain's most important noble houses. Virginia was the daughter of José Máximo De La Cerda y Palafox, 6th Count of Parcent, 6th Marquess of Bárboles (, ), cousin to Empress Eugenia of France, and of Marie de Gand-Vilain de La Rochefoucauld-Bayers, Marquise de Bayers, Comtesse du Saint-Empire, a Franco- Spanish aristocrat, granddaughter of the last Prince de la Rochefoucauld- Bayers. Virginia married Carlos Drake in 1847, the year he was made a count and gentilhombre to Queen Isabella II. Upon her father's death in 1851, Virginia became 7th Marchioness of Eguaras and was admitted into the Royal Order of Queen Maria Luisa. The couple had several children: * Carlos Drake y De la Cerda, 2nd Count of Vega Mar and 8th Marquess of Eguaras * Luis Drake y De la Cerda, married to the daughter of the Counts of Maluque * Emilio Drake y De la Cerda, 1st Marquess of Cañada Honda * Rosalía Drake y De la Cerda, who married her cousin José Luis De la Cerda, 9th Count of Villar. The Count of Vega Mar died in 1880. Virginia, the dowager countess died in 1909 getting to meet her grand-granddaughter Maria (later 3rd Marchioness of Cañada Honda). == Marriage and children == Emilio Drake married Maria Asunción Fernández-Durán y Bernaldo de Quirós in 1879. The young bride was another member of a prominent aristocratic family: her father was Manuel Fernández-Durán y Pando, 5th Marquess of Perales del Río (G.d.E) and 4th Marquess of Tolosa. The couple had ten children, among them: * Francisco de Paula Drake y Fernández-Durán (1880-1936), 2nd Marquess of Cañada Honda, who married Luisa de Santiago Lacave, daughter of General Luis Santiago, Minister of War. He was murdered by communists during the Spanish Civil War * Antonia Drake y Fernández-Durán (1888-1868) who married her cousin, Emilio Drake y Redondo, 10th Marquess of Eguaras. The couple made an acquaintance with Queen Regent Maria Christina and prominent of members of the Liberal Party, such as Antonio Maura (who later became a Conservative). In March 1893, in the context of \\"caciquismo\\", electoral strategy based on landlords putting pressure on peasants, Emilio Drake was granted the peerage of Marquess of Cañada Honda in exchange for \\"whipping\\" the votes of Segovia, his province, for the Liberal Party. Furthermore, Emilio was the youngest of his family and didn't get to inherit any of his family's grand titles hence why the queen regent created the peerage for him. == Death == Emilio Drake was last elected deputy in 1907 and left his seat in the Chamber of Deputies in 1908. He retired to his estate in La Cervanta, Toledo, the following year. He died in July 1915. His son, Francisco, became the 2nd Marquess of Cañada Honda.

She worked at St George's, University of London and pioneered the area of learning disability. She confronted cruelty at psychiatric hospitals and was a human rights advocate of institutionalized people with intellectual disabilities, unpopular with and never accepted by the medical establishment. She introduced multidisciplinary hospital management and community-based care. ==Early life and education== Joan Bicknell was born into a working class family in Isleworth, West London, UK. Her father Albert worked as a bricklayer, later in bomb disposal with Royal Engineers. Her mother, Dorothy (nee Smith), was a secretary. She had an older brother, Edward, who died as a teacher in Swaziland. She also had two fostered brothers with intellectual disabilities. Bicknell attended Twickenham County School for Girls and studied medicine at Birmingham University in 1962.Geoff Watts. Obituary Joan Bicknell. The Lancet. Volume 390, No. 10113, p 2622, 16 December 2017 DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)33113-6 ==Career== After graduation she worked with children at Ilesha Wesley Guild hospital in Oyo, Nigeria as a Methodist missionary.Bicknell. BMJ 28 July 2017; 358 doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.j3636 When the Nigerian Civil War began in 1967, she left for Sierra Leone to work with the flying doctor service. She returned to the UK to study psychiatry at Queen Mary's Hospital, in Carshalton, a hospital for long-term care of children in Surrey. In 1969, she obtained a diploma in psychological medicine, and in 1971 she completed a thesis on causes and prevalence of lead poisoning in institutionalised children.Sheila Hollins Joan Bicknell obituary The Guardian, 2 July 2017 She became a consultant psychiatrist at Botleys Park Hospital in Chertsey, Surrey. In 1978, she was appointed to a task force modernising psychiatric care at Normansfield Hospital. She introduced managing a hospital through a multidisciplinary team rather than, as was then customary, a Medical Superintendent. Eventually Bicknell was awarded a professorship at St George's, University of London and became Britain´s first female professor in psychiatry. In her inaugural lecture 19 November 1980 called \\"psychopathology of handicap\\" she dealt with the family´s reaction to the diagnosis of intellectual disability drawing an analogy to the stages of grief in the bereavement process.Professor Joan Bicknell, pioneer of enlightened psychiatry – obituary The telegraph, 16 July 2017 Bicknell concentrated on humanising care of people with intellectual disabilities. She took a position in bioethical hot spots years before others like the sterilization of minors with developmental disabilities in 1988, compared to the American Academy of Pediatrics for example in 1990.Sterilization of Women Who Are Mentally Handicapped Pediatrics May 1990, Vol 85 / Issue 5, 104(2):337 Her approach challenged the expectation that people were better not cared for in their own homes and meant that Bicknell was never part of the medical establishment. ==Personal life== Bicknell suffered asthma and other health problems, eventually mental illness. She retired early at age 50. She moved to Dorset county with her partner Diana Worsley, owning a farm for children with disabilities to have contact with animals. She died of cancer in Stalbridge in Dorset county. == Legacy== In 1990, the Psychiatry of Disability Division at St George's Hospital Medical School, established the Joan Bicknell Prize for the best essay on an aspect of the Psychiatry of Disability written and presented by a registrar and senior registrar.Joan Bicknell Prize Psychiatric Bulletin ( 1990), 14,382-383 A building in Tooting, London was named Joan Bicknell Centre. ==Further reading == * J.

Developed beginning in 1917 by the Underwood Typewriter Company, it was used by that company and its successors for manufacturing, research, and development until 1969. It presently houses the artistic collaborative Real Art Ways and other organizations. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. ==Description and history== The former Underwood Computing Machine Company plant is located southwest of downtown Hartford in the Parkville neighborhood, on bounded by Arbor Street, Orange Street, and the CTfastrak busway. The main building is a four-story brick structure, in length, with projecting stair towers at the north end, and at the corner of Arbor and Orange. The towers have brownstone corner quoining, and windows set in recessed panels. The main walls consists mainly of rows of windows set in segmented-arch openings separated by brick piers. The principal building entrances are recessed in the bases of the towers, one of which has Art Deco stylistic elements. The Underwood Computing Machine Company was founded in New York City in 1909 by John T. Underwood, then president of the Underwood Typewriter Company. The company manufactured calculators and accounting and billing machines for commercial use. Its early production facilities were located in Hartford's Chamber of Commerce building on Hawthorne Street. In 1916 that building was acquired by another tenant, and the Underwood Computing Machine Company sought new quarters. This facility was built beginning in 1917 to serve its needs, under a lease agreement that ended with the company buying it in 1927. The company itself was acquired by Elliot- Fisher in 1928, which moved production to a larger facility on Capitol Avenue. This plant was converted into a training, research and development facility in 1936. The company was purchased by Olivetti in 1959, and this facility was closed by Olivetti in 1969. It has since been rehabilitated and repurposed, housing the Real Art Ways collaborative among other organizations. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford, Connecticut ==References== Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford, Connecticut Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1917 Category:Buildings and structures in Hartford, Connecticut ","title":"Underwood Computing Machine Company Factory"},{"id":"56056290","text":"Tulus may refer to: *Tulus (singer), Indonesian singer **Tulus (album), a 2011 album by the singer *Tulus (band), Norwegian band *Tulus (village), village in Azerbaijan ","title":"Tulus"},{"id":"56056303","text":"On My Block is an American teen comedy-drama streaming television series, created by Lauren Iungerich, Eddie Gonzalez, and Jeremy Haft.

Trey Mangum of Shadow and Act wrote, \\"On My Block is different than anything we’ve seen on television in relation to the experience of growing up.

For a lovely story about friendship and timely societal issues, along with superb youth acting, here is your next binge.\\" Alexis Gunderson of Paste said, \\"When the final credits hit, it’s clear that not one second of the season’s 10 short episodes was wasted: Every line was measured out, every background track meticulously calibrated, every initially jarring tonal shift set up precisely for a singular cumulative effect that lands in the season’s final moments like a punch to the chest you realize too late you should have seen coming from a mile away.\\" Matt Seitz of New York Magazine wrote, \\"One of the many remarkable things about this series is how it folds crime and the awareness of potential violence into everyday life, which is something white sitcoms never do unless it’s a Very Special Episode.\\" Awards and nominations {  - !

She is known for her online videos and her TV series Dr. Pimple Popper. == Early life and education == Sandra Siew Pin Lee was born in the Flushing section of Queens, New York City, on December 20, 1970, to Chinese parents; her father, a retired dermatologist, is Chinese Singaporean while her mother is Malaysian Chinese. Both of her parents were one of 10 children in their respective families and had lived in poverty. Her parents migrated to New York in 1969, and the family relocated to Southern California when Lee was five years old. Lee attended UCLA as an undergraduate student. During this time, she worked part-time as a medical assistant for an allergist in Downtown Los Angeles. After her graduation from UCLA, Lee attended medical school at the Drexel University College of Medicine and graduated in 1998. She completed her internship at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. Lee completed her dermatology residency at Southern Illinois University. After her residency finished, she went to San Diego to further her experience with laser, dermatological and cosmetic surgery. Lee now lives in Upland, California with her husband, Dr. Jeffrey C. Rebish (married May 28, 2000), and currently works at Skin Physicians & Surgeons. == Career == Lee is a board certified dermatologist and a member of the American Academy of Dermatology, the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, and the American Society for Mohs Surgery. Online video In 2010, Lee began uploading videos to YouTube but did not begin to heavily post content until 2015, after she noticed the popularity of her Instagram videos of skin extractions. In exchange for written client permission to record and post content, Lee offers patients discounted or free treatment. In late 2019 the decision to make future content subscription-based drew criticism. She explained that it was caused by YouTube having blocked advertising in the channel's videos that usually featured unsightly material and thus the channel needing another source of funding. Skincare In 2017, Lee launched her own line of skin care products, SLMD Skincare Products. Products in the line include acne cleanser and lotion, clarifying treatment with retinol, and daily moisturizer. Prior to this, Lee also sold comedone extractors and other merchandise branded with the name of her channel. Television In 2018, Lee signed with TLC to have her own Dr. Pimple Popper TV series, which premiered on July 11. A special Christmas episode of Dr. Pimple Popper, \\"The 12 Pops of Christmas\\", aired on December 13, 2018. Season 2 of Dr. Pimple Popper premiered in January 2019, and Season 3 premiered in the United States on July 11, 2019.

He has served in multiple positions in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Wuco has been criticized for spreading conspiracy theories, including through a fictional character who supposedly is a former jihadist who now exposes aspects of Islam-inspired terrorism. ==Career== Wuco previously served in the United States Navy as an intelligence officer. Wuco completed Navy recruit training at the Naval Training Center San Diego in 1981. His postings included the USS Fox between 1987 and 1989. He reportedly retired from the Navy in 2004. He later worked at CENTCOM, where he served under future White House National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Wuco is the Founder and CEO of a security consultancy called Red Mind Solutions. He was the editor of a blog titled The Daily SITREP. He hosted the weekly Frank Wuco Radio Show on WFLA AM 970 in Tampa Bay from 2011 to 2013. From 2017 to November 2019, Wuco served as a senior White House advisor to the United States Department of Homeland Security. As White House adviser to DHS, Wuco led a team tasked with enforcing President Donald Trump's executive orders, including the administration's travel ban policies. According to Politico, John F. Kelly and his staff were often at odds with Wuco, with one person close to Kelly commenting that Wuco \\"knows nothing about the mission\\" of the department and \\"serves little purpose or value.\\" In November 2019, Wuco was appointed a senior advisor in the Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance of the State Department. In August 2020, Wuco was hired by the U.S. Agency for Global Media. ==Promotion of conspiracy theories== Frank Wuco portraying Faud Wasul in \\"Ask the Jihadist\\" January 2013 Prior to serving in the Trump Administration, Wuco hosted a talk radio show in Florida, where he promoted birtherism and criticized Islam. He commented, for instance, that \\"Obama knew nothing of the 'black American experience,' defended the initial speculation in the media that Muslim extremists were responsible for the mass killing in Norway, and said that gay people had hijacked the word 'gay' from happy people\\". He also created and played the part of a supposed former Muslim jidahist on his radio show, which he used to vent critiques of Islam and American policy. Among the many conspiracy theories he promoted on his radio show was that Barack Obama's memoir was actually ghostwritten by former radical left militant Bill Ayers, that former CIA director John Brennan was a Muslim and that former attorney general Eric Holder had been a member of the Black Panthers. In January 2010, Wuco created a fictional character called Faud Wasul. According to reporting by Mother Jones, Wasul is a \\"fictional terrorist whose 'model behavior' led him to be released from US custody so that he could tour the United States to talk about jihad\\". Wuco co-hosted or guest hosted role-playing as \\"Faud Wasul\\" sporting a keffiyeh scarf, faking an Arab accent, and impersonating a jihadist in multiple video blogs, on radio shows, and in live speeches. In a September 2012 appearance on a right-wing radio program, Wuco claimed that Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton, had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist political group, and that her parents were members of the organization. In January 2013, Wuco attacked Colin Powell for his condemnation of racism in the Republican Party. In February 2013, he claimed that John Brennan, then the nominee to be the director of the CIA, had converted to Islam when he was stationed in Saudi Arabia. Wuco interviewed former FBI agent John Guandolo, who is the only source for the unsubstantiated claim. In a May 2013 episode of his radio show, Wuco falsely claimed that then-Attorney General Eric Holder was involved in the Black Panthers in the 1970s. In January 2016, when speaking to The Dougherty Report, he was asked why the U.S. doesn't just turn Syria and Iran into \\"glass already\\". Wuco responded: \\"Um well, I — I mean, I know what you're getting at... I mean, it's, it's that our, I mean it's been our — I don't think it's been our policy really to just start nuking countries. I think if we were going to have done that, my preference would have been to have dropped a couple of low-yield tactical nuclear weapons over Afghanistan the day after 9/11 to send a definite message to the world that they had screwed up in a big way\\". ==References * Category:Living people Category:American conspiracy theorists Category:American critics of Islam Category:American conservative talk radio hosts Category:United States Navy personnel Category:Trump administration personnel Category:United States Department of Homeland Security officials Category:United States Department of State officials Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Frank Wuco"},{"id":"56056480","text":"Alen Abramović (born 4 November 1976) is a Croatian cross-country skier.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. As of 2017, the building houses The Bank, 1884 restaurant. ==History== Richard Winsor was born in Ontario in 1839. His family moved to Michigan in 1856, but his father drowned on Lake Huron in 1860, leaving Richard as the provider for the family. Winsor bought and cleared land, and began the study of law. He was elected to the Michigan legislature in 1862 and 1864, and was accepted into the bar in 1867. He moved to Port Austin, and in 1868 was elected to the state Senate. in 1871, he formed a law partnership with Judge Robert W. Irwin. Horace G. Snover was born in Romeo, Michigan in 1847. He attended the University of Michigan, graduating in 1872 with a law degree. In 1874, he moved to Port Austin and served as the principal of the local high school for two years. In 1876, he purchased Judge Irwin's interest in the law partnership with Richard Winsor, forming the firm of Windsor and Snover. After the disastrous Thumb fire of 1881 which burned much of four counties in Michigan's thumb, Winsor and Snover began buying up local land (as much as 20,000 acres by 1884), developing part of it for their own agricultural purposes and selling the remainder to new settlers. In 1884, Winsor and Snover moved into this new building, the first construction in Port Austin since the 1881 fire. They began operating their own bank out of the ground level of the building, with the legal firm operating out of the second floor. IN 1894, Snover bought out Winsor and took over the bank and the building. In 1918, it was purchased by a consortium headed by Albert E. Sleeper, and in 1957 the bank moved out of the building to another location in the community. The local library used the building from 1957 to 1960, after which it was either used for storage or was entirely vacant until 1981. In that year, it was purchased Norman James Levey, who, with Anthony and Marilyn Berry, began renovating the building into a restaurant. The Bank, 1884 restaurant opened in 1984, and continues to operate out of the building. ==Description== The Winsor and Snover Bank Building is a two-story, red brick building with High Victorian Gothic Revival details, located on a corner lot. There are three entrances, including a main entrance at the corner, a second on the opposite end of the main facade, and the last on the opposite end of the side facade. Brick pilasters divide the two major facades into seven distinct bays, with three on each facade and the last in the corner. There are windows on both the first and second-floor levels. The windows are two-over- two, rounded-arch, double-hung sash units with a sill of stone and a lintel composed of three rows of header bricks. ==References * The Bank 1884 restaurant Category:National Register of Historic Places in Huron County, Michigan Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Michigan Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1884 ","title":"Winsor and Snover Bank Building"},{"id":"56056669","text":"Ellegaard is a Danish surname.

At the height of their popularity during the turn of the 20th century, tattooed ladies transgressed Victorian gender norms by showcasing their bodies in scantily clad clothing and earned a salary considerably larger than their male counterparts. Tattooed ladies often used captivity narratives as a means for excusing their appearance, and to tantalize the audience. The popularity of tattooed ladies waned with the onset of television. == Origins ==  Olive Oatman  Olive Oatman by Benjamin F. Powelson, US National Portrait Gallery. Thirty years before tattooed women exploded on the sideshow and dime museum circuit scene, a young, white woman made national headlines with her unusual appearance and frightening story. During her family's westward emigration along the Santa Fe Trail in 1851, the Yavapi took thirteen-year-old Olive Oatman, along with her seven-year old sister Mary Ann, captive. The Oatman girls lived with the Yavapi until they were traded to the Mojave, with whom they lived until Mary Ann's death and Olive's subsequent rescue on February 22, 1856. Under the assumption that her entire family were deceased and that rescue proved impossible, Oatman assimilated to Mojave culture and acquired chin and arm tattoos as a means of identifying herself in the afterlife. According to Amelia Klem Osterud, Oatman's story parted with traditional captivity narratives and Victorian gender norms since she didn't \\"wither and die\\" due to her experience. Oatman deliberately reconciled her identity as an adopted Mojave with her new one as a marked white woman by traveling on a lecture circuit with her ghostwriter, Royal B. Stratton. Oatman's decision to sensationalize her narrative for profit and to exclude intimate aspects of it for self-protection demonstrates an astute awareness of her predicament. Since US society would not have tolerated Oatman's choice to assimilate into Mojave culture, or even accept her as a transcultural individual, she purposefully recast herself as a victim of outside brutality. In this way, Oatman garnered more nods of sympathy and support rather than stares of disgust. It has also been suggested that the Oilve Oatman story of captivation would not have been so popular in the era if she had not been tattooed by the Mohave people. It is also often claimed that Olive Oatman had not only been assimilated into Mohave life, but that she had also been married into the tribe, bearing a child. In turn, her story served as the model for future working-class women to exploit through mythical and scandalously revealing narratives. Using the victim narrative allowed women such as Oatman, and the ones who copied her story, to display their bodies for profit in a way that just passed for respectable during the Victorian era.  Becoming a tattooed lady  Getting started in the tattoo performing business was relatively quick and easy. Circuses and dime museums always searched for new and exciting acts and even went as far as posting wanted ads in newspapers for tattooed ladies. Acquiring tattoos proved to be an accessible and affordable investment with a massive payoff. During the late 1890s to early 1900s, tattoo artists typically charged less than a dollar for small tattoos, while a full body job totalled thirty dollars and took less than two months to complete. Performing in sideshows brought in serious cash; depending on her popularity, a tattooed lady made anywhere from $100 to $200 weekly during the turn of the century. Amelia Klem Osterud further expands on the significance of this salary: > \\"Teachers were making an average of $7 a week in 1900, which generally > included room and board; in 1909, clerical workers were only earning about > $22 a week […] while the average weekly salary for a man working in a > factory or some other industrial job in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was only $9.\\" The Roanoke Daily reported in 1895 that an unnamed tattooed woman, \\"was paid $100 a day,\\" and, > \\"[…]the fairy tale about her, as told by the showman, only heightened the > crowd's interest and harmed nobody. She was represented in the story as > having been stranded on one of the Sandwich islands, shipwrecked with her > husband, who was put to death. Her life was spared, but she was put to > torture, having these extraordinary characters tattooed all over her body. > There from 500 to 700 people at each other the 21 daily performances at > which that tattooed woman was exhibited, and all were pleased at the show, > for which they paid 10 cents. \\"Do many of these freaks, remarkable for > various reasons, get fine salaries?\\" \\"Indeed they do.\\" This excerpt from the Roanoke Daily also provides insight into 'smoke and mirrors' aspect of work as a tattooed lady. Referring to this unknown tattooed woman's story as a harmless fairytale reveals an awareness that Victorians held. Many knew the falsehood of these captivity stories, yet gladly spent their money to hear them for the sake of entertainment, as well as a chance to satiate their curiosity to see the female body in an uncharacteristic form. In this way, working-class tattooed ladies knowingly tapped into a market that turned the tables on their high-class counterparts by exploiting their gaze for sky-high prices. Other working-class women did not hesitate to justify their reasoning for becoming tattooed performers. In a revealing 1884 Sedalia Weekly Bazoo interview, tattooed lady Mary Baum shared a candid and similar start up story when asked where she got the idea to acquire tattoos from; \\"I don't know exactly,\\" said the varicolored lady. \\"I saw the other tattooed ladies in museums, and thought it would be nice.\\"  Advertising and money  It is important to note that while tattooed women did indeed earn substantially more than their working-class male counterparts, their salary was not necessarily steady. A tattooed woman's earnings depended on the seasons, popularity and success of the circus or dime museum she associated with, and competition from other tattooed performers. Some tattooed women expanded their reach beyond the tent and secured additional income by advertising products. For example, in an advertisement headlined: Punctured Purity: A Wonderfully Tattooed Lady, Nature and Art Perforated— A Beauty, Irene Woodward's name is used to sell pain-reducing St. Jacob's Oil; > \\"Miss Irene was tattooed by her father and underwent what was to her a > period of delightful suffering for seven years. The young lady during that > time suffered, of course, but were we to undergo such a delightful piece of > needlework, it is needless to say that we would want in close proximity a > bottle of […] St. Jacob's Oil […]I consider it as far superior to any other > medicine in curative power, as Miss Woodward, from an artistic point, is > above a bit of bric a brac.\\" Whether or not Irene profited directly off of the advertisement remains unknown, however, the media exposure assisted in gaining popularity and a wider audience. Ultimately, the positive wording in the advertisement, including the mention that Irene is above using a faulty product, attempted to elevate her into a respectable status. = Gaining respectability = Unlike the ease of acquiring tattoos, gaining respectability occurred with great difficulty. The consequences of acquiring tattoos and performing in skimpy outfits weighed heavily in terms of respect towards tattooed ladies. Irene Woodward's appearance served as a mark of deviancy, and most members of society found her exposed tattooed body repulsive outside of the high top. With this in mind, Victorians hardly viewed circuses and dime museums as beacons for good, clean family fun. Nonetheless, they remained curious and captivated by Woodward's tantalizing story. In order to toe the line between virtue and nonconformity, Woodward's media splash in the New York Times provided insight as to how both tattooed ladies and media outlets strategically crafted their image as respectable; > \\"Miss Woodward remarked that she felt a little bashful about being looked at > that way, never having worn the costume in the pretense of men before.The > tattooing, which was done in India ink, appeared artistic, and the devices > were carried and attractive. Around the neck was observed a floral necklace. > Dependent from this was a bunch of roses in full bloom dropping until their > graceful forms were lost beneath the lace edging of the bodice…the arms were > covered with stars hearts, floating angels, wreaths, harps, crosses, a full- > rigged ship, and various mottoes.\\" Prefacing Woodward's name with 'Miss', along with referencing her reluctance to reveal herself in front of male figures, for the first time reflects the attempt to legitimize her status as a proper lady, and softens the transgressive nature of her appearance. Woodward's first time occurred every time she presented her body before audiences; this served undoubtedly as a way to 'exclusivize' her display from city to city and to attract droves of spectators. The vivid descriptions of her tattoos, along with the use of the words: bashful, artistic, attractive, floral and graceful as descriptors, served as a way to further elevate and feminize Woodward's appearance. Other performers, such as Miss Creole and Miss Alawanda, adopted similar media tools in their presentation. As tattooed ladies became more commonplace in circuses and dime museums, the opportunities that came with the twentieth century also forced tattooed ladies to face new challenges. In order to stay exotic within the realm of changing ideas concerning respectability, these women thought of innovative narratives to compete with each other and recapture the attention of audiences. These women shifted the Victorian victim narrative to one that demonstrates elements of deliberate choice in becoming a 'self-made freak'. In a greater sense, the act of exposing their bodies for pay, and even operating independently without subordinating themselves to a male boss, defied traditionally held social expectations concerning a woman's bodily autonomy. == Functioning in mainstream society == True to their career-driven investment, tattooed ladies kept covered to not only prevent free shows, thus keeping their exoticism fresh, but to also prevent the wear and tear tattoos suffer over the course of aging and through regular sun exposure. Tattooed ladies strategically placed their tattoos in such a way that allowed them to dress modestly in public and to function in their daily lives unnoticed. Photographs of popular tattooed ladies reveal that their tattoos did not extend past their forearms, above their neck or below their ankles. In addition, many of these ladies' bore tattoos that included religious and patriotic iconography. Whether this was for personal preference or as a means of self-expression is not known, however, the organization and thematic nature of these tattoos demonstrate a common pattern. Tattooed ladies used such images to elevate the status of their tattoos as a proper art form worthy of display and as a way to soften the blow of their nonconforming bodies for spectators. Even the Ringling Brothers Circus management remained cognizant of this and encouraged employees, particularly women, to maintain respectable behavior on and off stage to dispel stereotyping associated with their acts; \\"we should want the \\"Town folks\\" to feel that the \\"Show folks\\" are real men and women and ladies and gentlemen as well.\\"\\"Suggestions and Rules for Employees, Ringling Brothers,\\" Photocopy of employee pamphlet. Circus World Museum, Baraboo, Wisconsin. In this way, the image of respectability encompassed not only a tattooed woman personally, but the entire reputation of the show she worked for. == Early tattooed ladies ==  Nora Hildebrandt  Nora Hildebrandt Nora Hildebrandt, one of the first tattooed ladies to perform in the US, wildly fictionalized her pasts to attract audiences captivated by her scandalous outfits, as well as the sexual undertones of her forced tattooing by Native Americans. In a pamphlet published around 1882, Hildebrandt's outlandish backstory included not only captivity among Sitting Bull's tribe, but also forced tattooing by her own father: > \\"One of Sitting Bull's warriors accused him of trying to poison them, and > the chief told the prisoner if he would tattoo his daughter he would give > him his liberty— that he must tattoo her from her toes to her head…He was > compelled to work six hours a day for one year before she was recused, > accomplishing three hundred and sixty five designs.\\"Robert Bogdan Private > Collection In reality, Hildebrandt was born into poverty under a different name in London, England sometime in the 1850s. Hildebrandt met professional tattoo artist Martin Hildebrandt, who was often presented as her father or husband even though they did not actually marry, and allowed him to tattoo her entire body in 1882. Though the process of tattooing during this time period involved crudely hand-poked images and long hours of intense pain, Hildebrandt's reward for becoming a self-made 'freak' was not kept secret. She enjoyed an exceptional amount of privilege as a tattooed lady. For example, the New York Clipper reported on March 22, 1884 that during her visit to Mexico, received > \\"the LARGEST AND MOST COSTLY PRESENTS EVER KNOWN [sic]…Among the presents > may be mentioned a HANDSOME MUSTANG MENAGE PONY, SADDLE AND BRIDLE FROM > PRESIDENT GONZALEZ, AND FROM HIS SON A PRECIOUS PAIR OF SOLITAIRE EARDROPS > [sic].\\" On the other hand, the media did not always behave kindly toward Hildebrandt. In a scathing 1882 review, the New York Times lambasted Hildebrandt's stout stature and masculine facial features; \\"her face is [so] hard that you wonder they ever got the needle through the skin without a hammer.\\" This statement reveals that no woman remained safe from oppressive societal standards of beauty. Indeed, a tattooed woman remained especially vulnerable to social commentary concerning aspects of her body outside of her control. With this in mind, how the media treated a tattooed lady ultimately determined her star's ability to rise. In turn, once tattooed women began to change their stories and use the media to their advantage, they experienced more longevity in their careers.  Irene Woodward  Not much is known about Irene Woodward's origins before her career as a tattooed lady. In fact, the New York Times claimed that > \\"She was the daughter of a sailor who began the tattooing when she was but 6 > years of age and finished it when she was 12. She was born near Dallas, > Texas, and has spent the greater part of her life in the Western wilds. She > conceived the idea of exhibiting herself after seeing the tattooed Greek in > Denver.\\" In a far less captivating story, Samuel O'Reilly and his not yet famous apprentice, Charles Wagner, tattooed Woodward. Unlike Hilderbrant, Miss Creole and Miss Alawanda, Woodward did not use the captivity narrative in full. Though her tattoos were still imposed from an outside individual, the implication that her father completed them suggested that the imposition came from within Western cultural practices rather than external ones. Woodward's unusually honest statement proves that her motive came from a place far deeper than her ink. She saw a male tattooed performer, the possibility of securing a living by replicating him, and reinvented herself. == Tattooed ladies in transition == As women began to experience greater social freedom due to suffrage, the New Woman Movement and the absence of male competition in the workforce during both World Wars, the tattoo evolved into a solidified marker of working-class folk art. Undoubtedly, tattooed women still faced harsh scrutiny for their appearance. However, with their limited options taken into consideration, the pay-off was ultimately worth it and women during this time period continued to perform. During the 1930s and onward, tattooed ladies deviated from fictionalized captivity narratives and boldly accounted for their choice of profession more freely.  Mae Vandermark  When asked in 1931 why she acquired her tattoos, Mae Vandermark quipped, \\"I love Art…and that's true, too—up to a certain point…I mean, I like to eat regular.\\"\\"Art Means Grub to a Tattooed Lady,\\" New York Post, April 7, 1931 Vandermark found that performing as a tattooed lady garnered a higher profit than working as a stenographer. According to a 1927 article in the Milwaukee Sentinel, Vandermark saw another woman with a small tattoo while swimming at Coney Island and decided she wanted one. Upon acquiring two, she met and became \\"great friends\\" with tattooed performer Lotta Pictoria \\"who persuaded Mae to be a professional.\\"Love Tragedy of the India-Rubber Man and the Tattooed Lady,\\" The Milwaukee Sentinel, August 14, 1927 In the same article, Pictoria is referenced as the person who introduced Vandermark to Charles Wagner and helped her gain a full body suit over the course of ten months for the bargain price of $130. This suggests that Pictoria mentored or showed Vandermark the ropes of performing as a tattooed lady by sharing her social connections with Vandermark, ultimately helping in launching her career.  Betty Broadbent  Betty Broadbent initially performed as the youngest tattooed woman ever during the 1920s. By the time bathing suits and hemlines rose, Broadbent decided to shock the public when she entered a beauty pageant at the World's Fair in 1939. While she had no chance of winning, Broadbent enjoyed the attention and free advertising, and assured her audiences that her wholesome act stood apart from \\"those carnival floozies with one or two tattoos who would bump and grind.\\" Like Vandermark, Broadbent's tattoos also bore references to pop culture icons and ones suited to her individual taste; she sported images of Charlie Chaplin and Charles Lindberg. In this way, Broadbent reflects the tattoo's permanence in American folk culture as an art form steadily gaining recognition. Incidentally, Broadbent's tattoos suggest a deliberate attempt to express oneself through choice rather than imposition or affliction. Broadbent's overt challenge to traditional female behavior also substantiated her tattoo narrative. Gone were the days of having to invent a victim tale to excuse her status as a tattooed lady. In fact, her souvenir postcard bluntly dispelled any mystery surrounding her choice in getting tattooed; \\"It was done for professional reasons only. I have no regrets for having chosen this most unusual career.\\" Broadbent's 1956 pay stub for $220 suggests no need for regrets, as her earnings were significantly high.Dana Brunson Private Collection == Fading away == During the 1950s and 1960s, business started to lag for many artists and tattooed ladies since circus shows and dime museums fell out of vogue. As the postwar era hailed a sense of conformity and normalcy, tattoos decreased in popularity and once again became stigmatized due to their longstanding association with criminal activity. Still, a small group of tattooed women, whose youth and ink faded considerably by this time, continued to perform where an audience gathered. Artoria Gibbons, one of the last ladies to perform, performed well into her eighties during the 1980s. Gibbon's performed not necessarily for money, but for the love of performance art.Charlene Gibbons, Facebook message to author, April 22, 2016. Though not as visible or discussed as often, tattooed ladies moonlighted as artists during their off seasons alongside their husbands. Many of these tattooed ladies learned the craft of professional tattooing from their significant others and paved the way for a new generation of women to secure their livings by creating feminine styles of flash in their own shops. == Tattooed ladies today == After sideshows faded away, tattooed women reentered mainstream society. They were not accepted into society because of negative connotations surrounding people with tattoos (tattooed men had an easier time). In recent decades, the popularity of tattooing has increased; women now obtain more than half of the tattoos. The tattooed lady is no longer the sideshow performers of the past, but is the everyday woman. Although the sideshow tattooed lady is no longer mainstream, tattooing among women has significant correlations with sexualization and gendered stereotypes that reinforce gendered expectations. A recent study of career-oriented women with tattoos found that the women felt strong support for their tattoos from their partners and friends, but not as much support from their mothers, siblings, and children. Fathers, physicians, registered nurses, and the public with whom tattooed women came into contact, were the least likely to voice acceptance of the tattoos. Because of the stigma, women tend to determine the placement of their tattoos differently than men. Generally, women will choose an area of the body where the tattoo will not be seen immediately or that can be covered up when needed. Women usually have the first tattoo placed on an unexposed part of their body. If they later choose another tattoo, a more visible body area may be selected. They also choose areas of the body that may be considered the most feminine. While women commonly choose the top of the foot, inner wrist, side of the rib cage, and shoulder, men choose the arm, chest, forearm, and back for their tattoos. For many years women with tattoos were placed into specific categories: circus sideshow acts, biker chicks, hippies, or prostitutes. The presence of a tattoo on a woman's body in today's society is not necessarily against the norm, though a certain sexual connotation still exists. Historically, tattoos have been viewed as a masculine trend but women are challenging this stigma by choosing to artistically enhance their bodies as a form of self-expression. When a woman's body is a sex object, a tattooed woman's body is a lascivious sex object; when a woman's body is nature, a tattooed woman's body is primitive. Their tattoos are culturally written over to punctuate meanings already attached to the female body within a larger cultural domain. Whatever the meaning behind a woman's tattoos, whether it symbolizes strength, beauty or sex, it is very clear that the tattooed lady is not disappearing from mainstream society as quickly as she did before.  Semiotics of Tattoos in Relation to Modern Feminism  Semiotics is “the study of signs.” These signs can be visual or auditory, and according to Peirce can take symbolic, iconic or indexical forms.  Tattooing to Drive a Cause  One of the most common reasons for getting a tattoo is to have a visual representation with a deeper meaning for the wearer and perhaps for others to see. Today, modern feminists often use tattoos as a means to drive a cause and as a material semiotic means of self-expression. One example of both uses is tattoos that subvert ideologies to meet an individual’s vision of self and interpretations, such as Marquis Bey’s tattoos of traditional Christian symbology, such as a cross and Psalm 23:4, to reinforce her own atheism, Blackness, and feminist qualities. Tattoos can add an extra layer of signifiers to skin, in the same way that age, gender, race, and other factors of the skin carry meaning. Some feminists use tattoos to self-define the female flesh, confronting essentialist ideas that define a woman’s body and social views of what women’s bodies should be. Thus women use tattoos to challenge essentialism and metanarratives.  How Women with Tattoos are Viewed  Although attitudes toward women with tattoos have improved in Western society over the past 30 years, there remains a stigma against female tattoo-bearers. A recent study at the University of Windsor, in Ontario, Canada, recorded undergraduates' attitudes toward people with tattoos. The primary factors that influenced attitudes included the gender of the tattoo bearer, followed by the placement and size of the tattoo. This sentiment is popularized in films such as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. In the original book and in Swedish film interpretations, the dragon tattoo on Lisbeth is massive, taking up nearly the entire surface of her back. In the Americanized version of the film, the dragon tattoo is considerably smaller, covering only her left shoulder. Judgmental attitudes and the minimization of both size and visibility of tattoos on women is not the only form of negative perception toward women with tattoos. There is a significant relationship between tattoos and how people perceive their bearers, particularly in the world of law enforcement with instances involving officers, judges, prosecutors, prison administrators, guards, and other prisoners. In these instances, people read the tattoo as text and often have harsher opinions of the tattoo-wearer because of a biased reading.  Tattoos as Fashion  The rise of tattoos as an art form rather than an identifier of bikers, prison gangs, and sailors has made tattoos a fashion statement. Some fashionable tattoos are chosen for cosmetic reasons, such as permanent eyebrows and lips, or masking scars after a mastectomy in place of reconstruction in breast cancer culture and self- care. Other forms of tattoos as fashion can be seen in the “modern primitives” fad that aims for a tribal or “primitive” aesthetic, and in “Indo-Chic” trends, which have popularized temporary tattoos using materials such as Henna, especially among women and girls in the United States. Some women use tattoos as a fashionable sex-symbol, starting with small, discreet tattoos and piercings when they are young, to satisfy heterosexual men. Many of these same women eventually evolve their tattoos to larger pieces with more meaning, often to help drive a cause or make a statement about an important topic. \\\\---- == See also == *Samuel O'Reilly *Body suit tattoo *Old school tattoo *Circus World Museum == References  Works cited == * Adams, Katherine H., Michael L.

The house of Finnigans was once one of the finest British leather goods makers and a successful luxury goods retailer. Renowned for its traditional know-how and craftsmanship, Finnigans manufactured and produced a wide range of luxury products, including trunks, bags, fashion, jewelry, timepieces, and silverware. == Early life of Brian Finnigan == Finnigans was founded by Brian Finnigan, an Irishman descended from Brian Boru, the charismatic king of Ireland in the high Middle Ages. He was the son of a seafarer, who spent summer months sailing off the coast of Newfoundland, where he hunted whale and seal in Arctic waters. In 1805, Brian Finnigan apprenticed to his father's friend and former sailing partner, Reuben Farrel, who then made leather goods in Liverpool, especially bags and trunks. This durable and weatherproof luggage was particularly adapted to the long and tedious journeys of that time. Both Reuben Farrel and Brian Finnigan moved to Manchester as it developed into a prosperous city with the boom of the cotton industry. == Mancunian origins == In 1830, Brian Finnigan established a house on his own, the house of Finnigans. He opened a workshop in Newton Street Mill, and a Finnigans shop in Market Street, then Manchester’s most fashionable area. Finnigans soon became famous for its high-quality leather goods and saddlery. Particularly timely, the opening of the shop coincided with the beginning of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway and Robert Stephenson's Rocket, the world's first steam passenger railway, which increased demand for travel goods. Finnigans devised a special range of items for railway travel like the “Lady Train Case,” with a jewelry tray and enough room for a woman's travelling wardrobe. From then on, the house relentlessly innovated to adapt its travel goods to new means of transportation from the railway to the automobile, and later air travel. As picnicking became a fashionable outdoor activity, Finnigans elaborated the “Wicker Picnic Basket,” which was popular not only among English travelers, but also Indian Rajahs who strapped them on the backs of elephants. == Expansion and advertising == In 1851, Finnigans gained international recognition when the house won a gold medal for craftsmanship at Prince Albert’s Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace, thereby spreading Finnigans’ reputation even wider. By 1855, Finnigans had branched out, and now advertised as a trunk and portmanteau manufacturer. Its range of items constantly increased to include new items that were adapted to the new means of transportation. One such item was the “Treble Folding Portmanteau” so constructed that the compartments were accessible at once and entirely distinct from each other, “rendering it unnecessary for luggage being disturbed or moved in passing through the customs.” The house's growth led to the opening of new premises at Piccadilly and Oxford Street, in addition to its original location at Market Street, Manchester. William Finnigan, who embodied the second generation of the family business, built on his father's business and was behind the company's diversification and commercial success. He took over when Brian Finnigan passed away in 1868. == Expanding to New Bond Street in London and Liverpool == In 1879, William Finnigan opened a Finnigans shop at 18 New Bond Street in London. Soon, American millionaires such as the Rockefellers, the Vanderbilts and the Fords joined the house's customer base. Opposite Finnigans on Bond Street was Asprey: the two houses enjoyed a friendly rivalry that led to fruitful commercial developments. Still specializing in leather and saddlery, Finnigans also sold clocks, watches, and silverware. Their London other addresses were Clifford Street, Coach & Horses Yard, Old Burlington Street while their London works were at 6-10 Lexington Street, W1. Finnigans also had stores in Liverpool at 32 Bold Street and 37-41 Dale Street. By the end of the century, the company outgrew its Manchester premises and moved to a more spacious building in Deansgate. With the department store Kendals at one end and Finnigans at the other, Deansgate became Manchester's main shopping street. The Deansgate store was later enlarged to encompass Finnigan's galleries, including a sports department, fashion and menswear, as well as beauty products. == Entering modernity == As the use of both personal and professional staff declined, the need for more lightweight luggage arose. Additionally, the use of motor car travel and the individual liberalization of travel were partly responsible for a new generation of luggage. Portability became Finnigans’ priority. In 1909, Finnigans advertised cases that were strong and resistant yet “so light you can easily carry one yourself and thus retain your jewellery and valuables under your own control.” In 1912, Finnigans also commercialized a “Lady’s Motor Hand Bag,” both lightweight and fitted. Finnigans adapted to modern forms of travel and developed special lines of luggage for overseas travel, especially on ocean liners such as the Titanic, Normandie, Queen Mary, and Canberra. While practical, Finnigans’ travel items were also of great workmanship. The house's lightweight dressing cases in colourful, polished Morocco were particularly successful. Among items of the highest luxury was a dressing case to be offered as a present for marriage or a birthday in crocodile skin, with solid gold mountings and tortoiseshell handles. Crocodile briefcases by Finnigans have become highly valued collectibles. In the 1930s, Finnigans launched a sports clothing line to fit the new lifestyle of the elite, and especially the vogue of sunbathing and swimming in seaside resorts. A two-piece bathing suit in bright yellow is preserved at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. Air travel brought weight restrictions and begat a reduction in the weight, size, and structure of luggage to which Finnigans contributed. New materials like vulcanized fiber replaced the heavier structured cases of leather and wood. == The Second World War and beyond == In 1938, the fourth generation of the family took over and Brian Finnigan, named after his ancestor, became the managing director. During the Second World War, the house of Finnigans contributed to the war effort as its factory produced much needed webbing equipment. Brian Finnigan expanded the reach of the family business and built up an export market to New York, Canada, and the Caribbean. After the war, Peter Finnigan joined his cousin Brian in the company and travelled to Macy's in New York in order to learn from modern American department stores and strengthen Finnigans’ export activities. The two men studied with interest the moving of city stores to suburban locations and the advent of the shopping mall. When the lease of the Deansgate store in Manchester expired in the 1950s, they pioneered this new retailing trend and moved Finnigans to Wilmslow, twelve miles from Manchester's city centre. Many other shops followed, making Wilmslow a thriving shopping center. While in Wilmslow, Finnigans retained its luxury positioning, and notably sold tailor- made suits in high quality tweed. The house also produced high fashion handbags in crocodile lined with suede that were of “lasting luxury.” In 1968, Finnigans closed its New Bond Street store in London. The company remained a family-run business until it shut down its last store in 1988. == The house of Finnigans today == The house of Finnigans has since changed hands and is now owned by the Luvanis company, which specializes in reviving long-dormant brands, such as Moynat and Belber. == See also == * Asprey == Further reading == * Finamore, Daniel, and Ghislaine Wood.

He served in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey between 2011 and 2015 as a representative from the pro- secular Republican People's Party. As an outspoken advocate of freedom of religion or belief, separation of mosque and state, and minority rights in the Middle East and beyond, Erdemir has been a leading voice against radical Islam and violent extremism, and a vocal critic of the persecution of religious minorities in the Middle East. Erdemir is one of the founders and former steering committee members of the International Panel of Parliamentarians for Freedom of Religion or Belief (IPPFoRB), the first multi-faith and bipartisan global network of parliamentarians committed to combating religious persecution and advancing freedom of religion or belief, as defined by Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. At the initiative's New York summit held along the sidelines of the 70th General Assembly of the United Nations, Erdemir stated that IPPFoRB is an \\"idea for which the time is right,” adding that people advocating rights should be as “outspoken, organised and transnational” as the violent extremists. Erdemir currently works as the Senior Director of the Turkey Program at Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Washington, DC. He also serves on the Anti-Defamation League's Task Force on Middle East Minorities. == Academic career == After graduating from Robert College, Istanbul, Erdemir earned his bachelor's degree in International Relations from Bilkent University, Ankara, and his master's degree in Middle East Studies from Harvard University. He received his doctoral degree from Harvard University's Anthropology and Middle East Studies joint program with his dissertation Incorporating Alevis: The Transformation of Governance and Faith-based Collective Action in Turkey. He was a doctoral fellow at John F. Kennedy School of Government's Center for Nonprofit Organizations, and a research associate at the University of Oxford's Centre on Migration, Policy and Society. Erdemir held teaching positions at Middle East Technical University's Department of Sociology (2004-2011) and Bilkent University's Department of Political Science and Public Administration (2015-2016). Between 2005 and 2010, he served as the Deputy Dean of the Graduate School of Social Science at Middle East Technical University. == Political career == Erdemir entered politics in May 2010 to support the bid of Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu for the leadership of the Republican People's Party. In the 15th Republican People's Party Extraordinary Convention, Erdemir was elected to the 80-seat Party Council. In 12 June 2011 general elections, at the age of 36, he was elected to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey as one of the youngest lawmakers of his cohort. In parliament, he served in Turkey-EU Joint Parliamentary Committee, European Union Harmonization Committee, and the Ad- Hoc Committee on the IT Sector and the Internet, and was the secretary of the Turkey-Sweden Caucus. In addition to representing his constituency of Bursa, Erdemir also served as a volunteer lawmaker for Batman, a city near the Syrian border with predominantly Kurdish and Arab inhabitants. Erdemir has identified patriarchy and gerontocracy as the leading problems of the Turkish political system, and as part of his attempts to reform the Republican People's Party, he has advocated introducing 50 percent gender quota with alternating female and male candidates as well as youth quota for under-30 candidates. Erdemir announced his decision to quit active politics in March 2015, stating that he would like to spend more time with his two daughters while also noting that the Turkish Parliament does not accommodate the needs of parents with young children.  Legislative Work  Erdemir's legislative work between 2011 and 2015 was focused on freedom of religion or belief, minority rights, discrimination, hate crimes, and hate speech. In parliament, Erdemir's first legislative initiative was to file a motion to establish an Ad-Hoc Parliamentary Committee on Hate Crimes. He later encouraged the Turkish government to draft a comprehensive hate crimes law, warning that \\"the issue cannot be reduced to Islamophobia\\" and criticized the absence of institutional mechanisms to track and report hate crimes in Turkey. In December 2012, in coordination with the umbrella group Hate Crimes Law Campaign Platform, he drafted a comprehensive hate crimes bill, which was later incorporated into the Turkish government's hate crimes bill of June 2014. Erdemir has criticized the government bill as a deficient law that acknowledges hate crimes, but fails to provide any real protections. Erdemir has been one of the most outspoken critics of antisemitism in Turkey. In September 2014, at a press conference he held at the Turkish Parliament to mark Rosh Hashanah, citing a recent study by the Anti-Defamation League, he warned that \\"Turkey tops Iran in antisemitism league.\\" The next month, he filed a motion to set up an Ad-Hoc Parliamentary Committee on Antisemitism to look into discrimination, hate speech, and hate crimes targeting Turkey's Jewish community, a first in the history of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. In November 2013, at the height of the Turkey-Israel flotilla crisis, Erdemir traveled to Israel to attend a conference at Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Truman Institute for Peace to promote Turkish-Israeli rapprochement, and stated that \\"politicians can give you many reasons why this can’t happen, but it takes a statesman to build peace.” In an op-ed he later penned for The Times of Israel, he warned that \\"real rapprochement with Israel requires Turkey to tackle antisemitism.\\" Erdemir has also been an outspoken defender of Turkey's Christian minorities. In December 2013, through a parliamentary inquiry, he exposed the restrictions imposed by Turkey's Ministry of Culture and Tourism on worship at historical churches. In May 2014, he exposed that the Turkish Parliament had been blocking access to Diyarbakır Protestant Church by classifying it as a \\"pornographic website.\\" He called the ban \\"humiliating, embarrassing, and defaming,\\" and succeeded in revoking the ban after raising the issue with the Speaker of the Turkish Parliament Cemil Çiçek, a development he referred to as \\"a small step for internet freedoms in Turkey, but a big step for internet freedom in the Parliament.” Erdemir later visited the Ahmet Güvener, the pastor of the Diyarbakır Protestant Church, ahead of Sunday service to offer apologies to him and his flock on behalf of the Turkish Parliament. In June 2013, Erdemir prepared a draft bill to lift the ban on Greek language instruction for the Eastern Orthodox Christian minority residing on the islands of Imbros and Tenedos. He also supported Turkey's Armenian community by attending the Easter liturgy at Diyarbakır's St. Giragos Armenia Church and the first baptism in a century at Van's Cathedral of the Holy Cross on the Akdamar Island. In April 2015, Erdemir prepared a draft bill for the restitution of citizenship to all ethnic and religious minorities and their descendants who have lost their citizenship within the last hundred years, which would restore rights to Turkey's Armenian, Greek, Syriac, and Jewish communities among others. Although Erdemir is a member of Turkey's Sunni Muslim majority, he has been an outspoken advocate of the rights and freedoms of the country's Alevi community. In February 2015, Erdemir drafted a bill to grant legal status to Alevi worship places, in an attempt to remedy a longstanding grievance of Turkey's Alevis. == Policy Work == Since June 2015, Erdemir has been a Senior Fellow at Washington, DC-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. As a policy analyst, Erdemir exposes Turkey's descent into authoritarianism and the plight of country's religious minorities. In the aftermath of Turkey's July 15, 2016 abortive coup, Erdemir warned that the coup attempt sparked backlash against Turkey's minorities. He later warned that the Turkish government and pro-government media were scapegoating Christians. He has been at the forefront of the global campaign to free U.S. Pastor Andrew Brunson, held in Turkey over trumped up charges of being a member of an armed terror organizations and plotting coup. He has testified at the U.S. Senate at a hearing held by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom on the treatment of Pastor Andrew Brunson and other religious minorities in Turkey. Erdemir's work continues to expose state-sponsored antisemitism in Turkey. He has documented the way in which Turkish Radio and Television Corporation-funded blockbuster Payitaht: Abdülhamid vilified Jews and Christians by distorting historical facts and propagating antisemitic anti-Western conspiracies. == Controversies == When Turkey's Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party government moved forward to pass a hate crimes bill in 2015, Erdemir, in an interview with pro- secular Cumhuriyet daily reporter Türey Köse, warned that the government's so- called hate crimes bill was going to function as a blasphemy law, failing to provide any legal protection for atheists, agnostics, and LGBTI individuals, and further restricting freedom of expression in Turkey. Islamist and far- right daily Yeni Akit journalist Talha Çolak claimed that in his Cumhuriyet interview, Erdemir had advocated that “it should not be illegal to curse at religion,” triggering widespread insults and death threats. Such a comment does not appear in the original interview, and was fabricated by the Yeni Akit reporter. Erdemir later penned an op-ed stating that he is not angry at Yeni Akit reporter Talha Çolak, but blame Turkey's authoritarian regime for \\"forcing journalists to earn their living through smear campaigns and defamation.\\" == Personal life == Erdemir is married to archaeologist and art historian Dr. Tuğba Tanyeri-Erdemir, an expert on the cultural heritage of religious minorities in the Middle East, who works as the coordinator of the Anti-Defamation League's Task Force on Middle East Minorities. They first met while studying at Bilkent University. The Erdemirs currently reside in Bethesda, MD along with their two daughters, Çiğdem Papatya and Ebru Duru. == Awards == On April 27, 2016, Norwegian human rights and religious freedom organization Stefanus Alliance International awarded Erdemir the Stefanus Prize for his outstanding contributions to defending freedom of religion or belief as defined by the Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On December 5, 2020, the Hellenic American Leadership Council presented Erdemir the First Freedom Award for his \\"outspoken defense of minority rights and religious freedom in Turkey and the broader Middle East.\\" In November 2014, Junior Chamber International chose Erdemir as \\"Turkey’s most outstanding young person in the field of politics, law and public administration\\" for his efforts in \\"fighting against discrimination and hate crimes and his bid to contribute to the development of governance and democracy in Turkey.\\" == References == Category:Living people Category:1974 births Category:Turkish anthropologists Category:People from Bursa Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Members of the 24th Parliament of Turkey Category:Turkish human rights activists ","title":"Aykan Erdemir"},{"id":"56056779","text":"Swedish Golfer of the Year is awarded annually by the Swedish Golf Federation.

She previously spent 17 years with IK Investment Partners where she latterly had responsibility for their Stockholm office. ==Early life and education== Born in 1970, Helena Stjernholm was brought up in the central Swedish town of Kristinehamn where she attended Källgårdsskolan and Södermalmsskolan before opting for technical secondary school subjects at Brogårdsgymnasiet. She then spent a year in the United States as an exchange student before completing her secondary education in Karlstad. On matriculating, she took a year off, working as a replacement teacher and a healthcare assistant. She also spent four months in Austria, working in a hotel and enjoying the skiing. She then attended Linköping University where in 1994 she earned a bachelor's degree in economics. She then spent a year in Munich studying business administration and management at Ludwig Maximilian University before returning to Sweden to study at the Stockholm School of Economics, earning an MSc in business administration, accounting and finance in 1997. While studying in Linköping, she met her husband Stefan Stjernholm with whom she has two sons. ==Career== After working for Bain & Company as a consultant (1997–98), she joined the venture capital firm IK Investment where she worked for 17 years. In 2015, she was appointed CEO of Industrivärden after Anders Nyrén left following an expenses scandal, no doubt because she was considered to be completely above board. Nevertheless, many were surprised by her move from a dynamic venture capital company into an investment firm with holdings in several of Sweden's largest listed companies. It turned out that her appointment reflected a change in strategy as Industrivärden decided to consider investing in small companies too. Stjernholm also serves on the boards of Handelsbanken, SCA, Skanska and SSAB. In March 2017, Veckans Affärer named Helena Stjernholm the most powerful Swedish businesswoman of the year. She said she was happy to have earned the title as it would inspire younger women to progress in business. She had succeeded in achieving better results not only for Industrivärden but for their holding companies Volvo, SSAB and Sandvik.

Its common name is the Chinese cave gecko or simply cave gecko. == Characteristics == They can grow in size up to 16 centimeters (6.3 in) long including tail and are often found close to bodies of water. They have typically large red eyes with movable eyelids much like the leopard gecko. In terms of color these animals are usually gray with black spots and yellow or orange bands in the dorsal area. Ventral area is nearly white and translucent. Five clawed fingers allow easy climbing of rocky terrain. They prefer high humidity and low temperatures of 22–25°C. Goniurosaurus geckos lack adhesive toepads. The main source of food for these lizards are roaches, crickets and other insects. == Captivity == Since the 1990s these lizards can often be found at various reptile shows or online animal shops. The key to success in captivity is daily misting, enough hiding places and space for adult animals. Males tend to be territorial and fight. Problems with shedding are common and often the main cause of death. ==References== Category:Goniurosaurus Category:Reptiles of China Category:Endemic fauna of Hainan Category:Reptiles described in 1908 Category:Taxa named by Thomas Barbour ","title":"Goniurosaurus hainanensis"},{"id":"56056903","text":"Lofton Henderson Memorial Bridge (formerly, 21st Street Bridge) is a cantilever truss bridge that carries Ohio State Route 611 (Henderson Drive) over the Black River in Lorain County, Ohio. ==See also== * * * ==References== Category:1939 establishments in Ohio Category:Bridges in Lorain County, Ohio Category:Road bridges in Ohio ","title":"Lofton Henderson Memorial Bridge"},{"id":"56056913","text":"* Jacopo Tintoretto — famous painter * Domenico Tintoretto — his son * Marietta Robusti (Tintoretta) — his daughter * Tintoretto (cocktail) ","title":"Tintoretto (disambiguation)"},{"id":"56056924","text":"Jorge Romero Sáez (born 15 December 1984) is a Spanish football manager, currently in charge of Real Madrid Juvenil A. ==Manager career== Born in Córdoba, Andalusia, Romero joined Córdoba CF in 2009, from Don Bosco CF.

In 1391 he accompanied Henry on his crusading expedition to Prussia and Lithuania during the Lithuanian Civil War. He did not appear on the national scene in England until involvement in court cases in London in 1394 and 1397, followed in 1399 by a mission to buy horses for the new king in Ireland. The year 1400 saw a number of appointments: he served as High Sheriff of Hampshire and was made Receiver-General of the Duchy of Cornwall for Henry, Prince of Wales, remaining in post until the prince became king in 1413. He was given a ten- year lease of the manor of Pyworthy in Devon, which had been confiscated from the beheaded Earl of Salisbury, the valuables of another traitor, the MP Thomas Shelley, and in addition the lands forfeited by a third rebel, Thomas Wintershall, of Bramley in Surrey. Himself a widower, Waterton married Wintershall's widow, through her gaining valuable estates in Surrey and Hampshire which gave him a base close to the seats of power at Westminster and Windsor. With the property to qualify for Parliament, he was elected for the Surrey seat in 1402. In 1410 two royal grants added to his interests in the north of England, both in Yorkshire, first being the lands of the late William Bowes and secondly those of Richard Duffield. In 1411 he served as High Sheriff of Surrey. When the young prince became king in 1413, further promotions followed. He was made Master of the Horse, holding the post until 1416, and next year Constable of Windsor Castle, which he held for life. Beyond these important national offices, he was employed on the international scene. In 1414 he acted as English ambassador to the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, then in 1415 to King Ferdinand I of Aragon, and in 1416 was beside Henry V for a meeting with his ally John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, followed in 1417 by a meeting with ambassadors from France. He was dead by 1 November 1417. ==Family== His first wife (died before 1400) was a daughter of Thomas Methley, tenant of Waterton, and they had five known children: :Robert. :Richard, also an MP, who married Constance Assenhull and had a daughter Jane (died 1461), the wife of Sir Robert Tyrwhitt (died 1457). :John (died 1414). :Eleanor, who in about 1409 married Sir Robert Babthorpe, later Comptroller of the Household. :Mundane, who married Thomas Metham.

Cigarettes were manufactured by the Norwegian subsidiary of BAT (formerly \\"Dr. J. L. Tiedemanns Tobaksfabrik\\"). ==History== There was a tobacco war going on nearly 100 years ago, and it arrived Norway soon after the British-American Tobacco Co., (Norway) Ltd. was established in Oslo in 1905. It rapidly became a cruel war between the American tobacco trust (led by American Tobacco Company's James 'Buck' Duke) and the Norwegian manufacturers. In the United States president Theodore 'Teddy' Roosevelt was fighting the American trust/enterprise, and he soon became a kind of hero for the Norwegian manufacturers. In 1914 J. L. Tiedemanns Tobaksfabrik honored Roosevelt by launching a cigarette brand named Teddy. The trust war in Norway ended in November/December 1930 when BAT (Norway) was split between BATCO (45%), Tiedemann (45%), DnC (5%) - a bank, Andresens Bank (5%) - a bank owned by the Andresen family, the real owners of J. L. Tiedemanns Tobaksfabrik, when A/S Norsk-Engelsk Tobakkfabrikk (NETO) was established. In November 1933 NETO was completely in the hands of J. L. Tiedemanns. In a commercial shown on early Norwegian TV, Teddy was presented as a cigarette for sportsmen and physically active Norwegians. Teddy was miles ahead of the nearest Norwegian brand on the market in age. Blue Master (a toasted brand also manufactured by J.L.T.) was launched in 1937, but Virginia cigarettes aren't as popular as they used to be in Norway, so it will take a miracle if Teddy will reach the 100. The brand was introduced in 1914 and the cigarettes use a Virginia tobacco. The brand was discontinued in 2010. ==See also== * Cigarette * Tobacco smoking ==References== Category:British American Tobacco brands ","title":"Teddy (cigarette)"},{"id":"56057237","text":"Goniurosaurus yingdeensis, also called the Yingde leopard gecko, is a gecko endemic to China. ==References== Category:Goniurosaurus Category:Reptiles of China Category:Reptiles described in 2010 ","title":"Goniurosaurus yingdeensis"},{"id":"56057244","text":"Hellenic Federation of Mountaineering and Climbing (, EOOA), located in Athens, is the Greek federation of mountaineering and climbing, competition climbing and ski mountaineering.History of EOOA on official site ==References External links == * Mountaineering and Climbing Category:Organizations based in Athens Category:Climbing organizations Category:Organizations with year of establishment missing ","title":"Hellenic Federation of Mountaineering and Climbing"},{"id":"56057248","text":"The Archdeacon of Clonfert was a senior ecclesiastical officer within the Diocese of Clonfert until 1625; the Diocese of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh until 1834\\"Fasti Ecclesiae Hibernicae: The succession of the prelates Volume 4\\" Cotton,H. pp180-182 Dublin, Hodges & Smith, 1848-1878 when it became an office within the Diocese of Killaloe and Clonfert.

In 2009, MMAFighting.com was acquired by AOL. In 2011, it was sold to their current owners, Vox Media, where they now are a part of SB Nation. MMA Fighting features several writers, including senior editor Luke Thomas who is notable on MMAFighting.com as a charter and regular panelist on The MMA Beat web series previously moderated by MMA journalist Ariel Helwani, and for his weekly webcast Promotional Malpractice and podcast Monday Morning Analyst.

UFC 199 controversy  On June 4, 2016, during the UFC 199 PPV, Ariel Helwani, photographer Esther Lin, and videographer E. Casey Leydon, who were all credentialed as part of MMA Fighting an in attendance at the event, were escorted out of the building. Helwani later said that their credentials were taken away and that they were banned from UFC events. Helwani earlier reported the return of Brock Lesnar at UFC 200, hours before UFC announced it on the broadcast, without notifying UFC first. According to UFC commentator Joe Rogan, Helwani was asked to not report this news, as management suspected a mole had leaked it to him and, without knowing who it was, would then have to fire all possible moles. Through Twitter, Helwani called Rogan's story \\"100% inaccurate.\\" On June 6, after an outpouring of support from fans and UFC fighters, UFC rescinded the ban. In a statement, they said that \\"following a conversation with the editorial team at SB Nation, UFC will not prevent MMAFighting.com from receiving media credentials to cover live UFC events. We respect the role the media plays in our sport and beyond, including MMAFighting's ability to report news. However, in our opinion, we believe the recurring tactics used by its lead reporter extended beyond the purpose of journalism. We feel confident our position has now been adequately communicated to the SB Nation editorial team.\\" == Awards == In the World MMA Awards, MMA Fighting has won the award for \\"Media Source of the Year\\" a total of four times, including three consecutively between 2015 and 2017.

On July 25, 2018, it was announced that BET had canceled the series. ==Premise== The Rundown with Robin Thede saw comedian Robin Thede's \\"take on the week's headlines in politics and pop culture with a fast-paced, no-holds-barred show that featured social commentary, sketch comedy and pop culture parodies.\\" ==Production== Background Thede was a head writer and performer on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore. From 2015-16, she was the head writer for the first season and a half of The Nightly Show, the first African-American woman to hold that position on any late-night talk show. Development Two weeks after The Nightly Show was canceled in August 2016, Thede partnered with production company Jax Media to produce an independently financed pilot for a weekly show that would integrate her comedic takes on headlines with sketches, musical performances, and documentary-style segments. Soon thereafter, Chris Rock became involved in the production, the pilot was produced, and it was quickly sold to BET. On April 26, 2017, it was announced that BET had given the production a series order for a first season consisting of 24 episodes. Executive producers were reported to include Robin Thede, Chris Rock, and Tony Hernandez. On July 25, 2018, it was announced that BET had declined to renew the series for a second season, effectively canceling it. Podcast The show had a podcast aftershow, entitled The Ran-down, that was released every Thursday after an episode airs on television. Each episode of the podcast featured a surprise celebrity guest, something the television show didn't feature often due to time constraints. ==EpisodesReception== The Rundown with Robin Thede met with a positive response from critics. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, its sole season holds a 100% approval rating with an average rating of 9 out of 10 based on 5 reviews.

It is based on the empirical observation that Non-covalent interactions can be associated with the regions of small reduced density gradient at low electronic densities. In quantum chemistry, the non-covalent interactions index is used to visualize non-covalent interactions in three-dimensional space.Pastorczak, E. and Corminboeuf, C. (2017) ‘Perspective: Found in translation: Quantum chemical tools for grasping non-covalent interactions’, The Journal of Chemical Physics. AIP Publishing LLC , 146(12), p. 120901. doi: 10.1063/1.4978951. Its visual representation arises from the isosurfaces of the reduced density gradient colored by a scale of strength. The strength is usually estimated through the product of the electron density and the second eigenvalue (λ) of the Hessian of the electron density in each point of the isosurface, with the attractive or repulsive character being determined by the sign of λ. This allows for a direct representation and characterization of non-covalent interactions in three- dimensional space, including hydrogen bonds and steric clashes.Johnson, E. R. et al. (2010) ‘Revealing Noncovalent Interactions’, Journal of the American Chemical Society. American Chemical Society, 132(18), pp. 6498–6506. doi: 10.1021/ja100936w.Contreras-García, J., Yang, W. and Johnson, E. R.

American Chemical Society, 115(45), pp. 12983–12990. doi: 10.1021/jp204278k. Being based on the electron density and derived scalar fields, NCI indexes are invariant with respect to the transformation of molecular orbitals. Furthermore, the electron density of a system can be calculated both by X-ray diffraction experiments and theoretical wavefunction calculations.Saleh , G. et al. (2012) ‘Revealing Non-covalent Interactions in Molecular Crystals through Their Experimental Electron Densities’, Chemistry - A European Journal, 18(48), pp. 15523–15536. doi: 10.1002/chem.201201290. The reduced density gradient (s) is a scalar field of the electron density (ρ) that can be defined as s(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\frac{\\\\left  abla\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\right  }{2 (3\\\\pi^2)^{1/3} \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r})^{4/3} } Within the Density Functional Theory framework the reduced density gradient arises in the definition of the Generalized Gradient Approximation of the exchange functional.Perdew, J.

Available at: https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.3865 The original definition is s(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\frac{\\\\left  abla\\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\right  }{2k_F \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) } in which k is the Fermi momentum of the free electron gas.Hohenberg, P. and Kohn, W.

Their history is documented in the local books until the beginning of the 17th century. Gregor Emmert, father of the composer, was born in Bavaria, and the Emmert family moved to Bohemia after World War I.Čtveráčková, Petra. Kritická edice 25. symfonie Františka Gregora Emmerta. Bachelor Thesis, Musicology Department at Masaryk University, Brno, 2014. p.9 Emmert was born in Mstišov, near Teplice in North Bohemia. In 1954, he went to study in Prague. He graduated from High School of Music Education and went on to take classes at the Prague Conservatory in piano, under Lev Esch, and composition, privately under Jan Zdeněk Bartoš. Later he continued his composition studies at the Janáček Academy of Music and Performing Arts (JAMU) in Brno, under Jan Kapr and Miloslav Ištvan. After his graduation in 1975, he started to teach composition at JAMU himself.Spáčilová, Jana, \\"Emmert, František\\", Český hudební slovník osob a institucí (accessed 22 Feb 2018). As a Catholic, Emmert was never a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.Dlask, Vojtěch. Dosavadní symfonické dílo Františka Gregora Emmerta. Diploma Thesis, Janáček Academy of Music and Performing Arts, Brno, 2005. p.6 He represented an alternative to the \\"Compositional School of Brno\\" (rationally and numerically composed music by Miloslav Ištvan and Alois Piňos), and many later Brno composers, including Pavel Zemek, cite him as an influence. In the 1970s, he became one of the key composers for the Husa na Provázku Theatre, where he composed an adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel Demons. He also established himself as a composer of symphonic music, with 25 completed symphonies. His chamber and vocal music is inspired by the spiritual meaning of the Catholic Church and mysticism. In 1991, he became a docent, and in 2006 was named a professor at JAMU.Čolović, Sofija. Kritická edice cyklu Nirmal Hridaj Františka Emmerta. Diploma Thesis, Musicology Department at Masaryk University, Brno, 2014. p.8 His composition classes were taken by many contemporary composers of artificial music, including Mojmír Bártek, Zoja Černovská, Afrodité Katmeridu, Pavel Malý, Martin Štědroň, Leoš Kuba, Mário Buzzi, Barbora Škrlová, Lenka Foltýnová, Ondřej Šárek, Jana Bařinková, Vojtěch Dlask, Tomáš Lučivjanský, Adrian Demoč, Vratislav Zochr, Jan Dobiáš, Irena Franková, Martina Kachlová, David Postránecký and Tereza Zemanová. He was awarded many times for various compositions. He died on 17 April 2015 in Brno. His son František Emmert is a writer of non-fiction, with a focus on 20th century history. == Style == Initially, Emmert’s music was heavily inspired by spiritual German music with emphasis on traditional counterpoint. His early work, until 1975, is marked by avant-garde and its typical signs are aleatoric, multiserialism or timbre music. From the second half of the 1970s, he went back to his roots as his faith returned. His work was then marked by older compositional techniques and influences of the romanticism and medieval music (Guillaume de Machaut). His perception of postmodernism slightly differed from the standards; Emmert did not work with citations, he just arranged harmony.Laborová, Anna. František Gregor Emmert: 22. symfonie 2000 Laudate Dominum. Kritická edice. Diploma Thesis, Musicology Department at Masaryk University, Brno, 2016. p.11 He was one of the first Czech composers who could be labelled as postmodernist. His later symphonies from the 21st century (Symphony No. 18 and after) are composed for large symphonic orchestras, usually scored in biform and polytempo for non-traditional instruments such as clarina and baritone oboe.Čolović, Sofija. František Gregor Emmert: Katalog orchestrálních skladeb. Diploma Thesis, Musicology Department at Masaryk University, Brno, 2016. p.14 These aspects mark Emmert's final stage of composition. Most of his symphonies are subtitled. Symphony No. 25 was the last of Emmert's work premiered, on 1 June 2017 in Brno, by the Ensemble Opera Diversa string orchestra, with soloists Milan Pal’a (viola), Marek Pal’a (organ) and Jarmila Balážová (mezzosoprano), and conducted by Ondrej Olos. == Selected works ==  Symphonies  Emmert finished 26 symphonies. * Symphony No. 5 \\"Kosmické zvony\\" (Cosmic Bells) for soprano, male choir, tape recorder and orchestra (1971) * Symphony No. 10 \\"Euanggelion\\" (1985) * Symphony No. 12 \\"Veraikon\\" (1986) * Symphony No. 16 \\"Útěcha zarmoucených\\" (Soothing The Saddened) for solo violin, two string quartets and two chamber orchestras (1990) * Symphony No. 23 \\"Věčný Jeruzalém\\" (Jerusalem Eternal, 2004)  Chamber music  * Tamango (suite for string orchestra and timpani, 1962) * Sonata for organ (1968) * Trio for oboe, cello and piano (1985) * Decimetto for brass instruments (1986)  Choral works  * Otče náš (Lord's Prayer, 1984) * Magnificat (1985) * Biblické písně (Biblical songs, 1986) == References  Further reading == *Bártová, Jindřiška.

Both tombs were built from precisely manufactured limestone monoliths, plastered and painted inside. The graves were covered flat, they have neither access (Dromos) nor the usual vaulted ceiling. In both graves, the stone roof construction was partially removed, so that one has a good view from above. Access to the graves is not possible. A metal cover protects the structures from weathering. Tomb A The western grave has a pre-chamber and the actual burial chamber. The two chambers were separated by a double- winged marble door, which is completely preserved. The door was made, as in the neighboring Macedonian Tombs at Korinos, as a faux wooden door. Thus, iron bands and their attachment are mimicked. The floor is covered with stone slabs. The plaster of the interior walls is painted following the pattern of the smaller tomb. In the burial chamber are the remains of a stone couch (Kline), on which the deceased was buried. To protect the marble doors from falling over, they are supported by wooden struts and metal bars. Tomb B The smaller, eastern grave is designed as a single-chamber grave. It was adorned by a two-tone painting. The plaster of the upper layer of the monolithic masonry is painted with yellow paint, the plaster of the underlying cuboid was decorated with red paint. The floor is laid out with stone plates. ==Literature== Ekaterini Despini [Αικατερίνη Δεσποίνη]: Ο τάφος της Κατερίνης.

On 20 November 2001, part of its journalistic content was paywalled, but in 2007 it was reopened, completely free of charge. As of 2012, its historical databases are also free and open access. In 2003, it became Chile's first digital newspaper to be recognized as such by the , that is, it has a status similar to that of the printed press published on paper, including the power to publish legal notices. The paper press media, led by El Mercurio, filed an appeal for protection before the to reverse that decision, which was dismissed by both that court and the Supreme Court in the second instance, setting an important precedent in the matter. On 25 May 2010 the newspaper launched an online television channel, . This is currently transmitted by a digital television signal on channel 26 within the ring of Américo Vespucio Avenue in Santiago. ==Organization== El Mostrador is owned by La Plaza S.A. Its president is Germán Olmedo Acevedo, while its vice president is Federico Joannon Errázuriz. The journalistic director is Héctor Cossio López and the deputy director is Iván Weissman. ==Content== The El Mostrador website is organized into the following sections: * News: National and international news, editorials, and letters to the director, among others * Markets: News from the economic field * TV: Analysis, opinion, and cultural billboard in video format * Culture+City: News from the cultural field * Online Life: News from the technological field and the Internet ==Incidents== On 19 March 2010 El Mostrador published a report that linked the newly appointed governor of Bío Bío Province, José Miguel Steigmeier, with the inner circle of Paul Schäfer, ex-leader of Villa Baviera, and with supposed participation in money laundering. Faced with this information, Interior Minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter summoned Steigmeier to La Moneda Palace that same day, deciding after the meeting to revoke his appointment to govern Bío Bío. On 22 April 2010 Mirko Macari left the directorship of El Mostrador due to his appointment as director of the newspaper La Nación. However, pressures from the Independent Democratic Union (UDI) made the government of Sebastián Piñera reverse the decision the following day. The return of Macari to his original post at El Mostrador was made public through a press release from the electronic medium published on 23 April, under the consideration that the previous withdrawal was a voluntary act and that the journalist satisfied \\"fully the standards of pluralism, independence, and quality that characterize El Mostrador.\\" ==References * Category:2000 establishments in Chile Category:Chilean news websites Category:Internet properties established in 2000 Category:Publications established in 2000 Category:Spanish-language websites ","title":"El Mostrador"},{"id":"56057566","text":"Henry Varian Daly (20 July 1838 – 3 June 1925) was an Anglican archdeacon in Ireland in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Oklahoma's new defensive coordinator Ruffin McNeill was able to simplify the defensive plan which helped turn out good results against Texas Christian in the previous week with a Sooner victory 52-27. K-State's Coach Snyder commented: \\"They're very much the same football team that they were on the defensive side of the ball, on both sides actually, but certainly on the defensive side. I saw some tweaks, a few things, that you might consider to be changes -- don't know if they're changes or are just there and hadn't surfaced previously.

However, resolving issue Y often does not resolve issue X, or is a poor way to resolve it, and the obscuring of the real issue and the introduction of the potentially strange secondary issue can lead to the person trying to help having unnecessary difficulties in communication and/or offering poor solutions. The XY problem is commonly encountered in technical support or customer service environments where the end user has attempted to solve the problem on their own, and misunderstands the real nature of the problem, believing that their real problem X has already been solved, except for some small detail Y in their solution. The inability of the support personnel to resolve their real problem or to understand the nature of their inquiry may cause the end user to become frustrated. The situation can make itself clear if the end user asks about some seemingly inane detail which is disconnected from any useful end goal. The solution for the support personnel is to ask probing questions as to why the information is needed, in order to identify the root problem and redirect the end user away from an unproductive path of inquiry. == Origin == The term XY problem was implicitly coined by Eric S. Raymond in his text How To Ask Questions The Smart Way when adding \\"How can I use X to do Y?\\" to the \\"Questions Not To Ask\\" section (although note in this original version, the meanings of X and Y are swapped): > Q: How can I use X to do Y? > A: If what you want is to do Y, you should ask that question without pre- > supposing the use of a method that may not be appropriate. Questions of this > form often indicate a person who is not merely ignorant about X, but > confused about what problem Y they are solving and too fixated on the > details of their particular situation. The problem itself was known long before it received this name. In 1980's \\"Applied Management Science: A Quick and Dirty Approach\\", Gene Woolsey described a famous example of solving the wrong problem. Management was concerned about complaints that people had to wait too long for elevators, and so spent a lot of time and money researching how to schedule elevators to reduce the wait times. Woolsey pointed out that they were trying to solve the wrong problem. The real problem was that \\"people were complaining\\". The installation of large mirrors in the lobby gave people something to do, and the complaints were drastically reduced. ==See also== * Attribute substitution ==References External links == * http://xyproblem.info/ * https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/66377/ * https://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem * https://weblogs.asp.net/alex_papadimoulis/408925 Category:Help desk Category:Customer service ","title":"XY problem"},{"id":"56057696","text":"Nuwanidu Fernando (born 13 October 1999) is a Sri Lankan cricketer.

He attended Berkeley High School, where he played basketball and helped lead the team to Tournament of Champions title in 1949. After high school, he briefly worked as an animator for Walt Disney before studying pre-med at University of California, Berkeley, where he was captain of the basketball and baseball teams. He was offered a contract with the New York Giants, but declined in order to pursue a career in medicine. == Medical career == Albo received his medical education at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), graduating in 1959.

He specialised in general, vascular, and oncological surgery. == Magic collection == Albo was an amateur illusionist, and held a collection of magic apparatus that grew to be the largest in the world. It contained over four thousand pieces and was used to write his well regarded series of books, Classic Magic With Apparatus. Originally intended to be a trilogy, it eventually grew to 11 volumes. It was followed by further books focused on the magic of Okito and Thayer. In 1992, selected items from the collection were displayed over three of the terminals of San Francisco International Airport. In 1994, Albo agreed to sell the entire collection to David Copperfield, though some items were not transferred to Copperfield until 2010.
