Analysts have questioned the panel's will and ability to challenge the government, but the commission has challenged the President's claims that there are no political prisoners in Myanmar, calling for all political prisoners' release and amnesty. In February 2012, its chairman, Win Mra, ruled out the possibility of investigating human rights abuses in ethnic minority areas, calling it premature to investigate in conflict areas. According to NHRC's chairman Win Mra, the commission was formed under the Paris Principles, as an independent body, to investigate complaints of possible human rights violations. The former commission was formed on 5 September 2011 under Notification No. 34/2011 by President Thein Sein with 15 commissioners. The commission was reformed on 24 September 2014 under Notification No. 23/2014 because of the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission Law with 11 commissioners. The commission's office is located in Hlaing Township, Yangon. Its formation, which is not mandated by the constitution, has been a source of controversy, especially when it requested a share of the national budget (K 547,208,000) for 2012 to 2013, as the NHRC is not a Union-level body. Its predecessor, a human rights committee under the Ministry of Home Affairs, was formed on 26 April 2000. == Members == The 7-member body largely consists of civilians from academia (2 retired professors), foreign affairs (3 retired ambassadors), and civil servants. While the previous iteration of the Commission had several members who are from ethnic minority groups including Rakhine and Karen, its current composition has fewer ethnic minorities. Its chairman, Win Mra, is an ethnic Rakhine. commissioner, Soe Phone Myint, is an ethnic Kayin. # Win Mra (Chairman) # Sit Myaing (Vice-Chairman) # Myint Kyi # Yu Lwin Aung # Nyunt Swe # Khin Maung Lay # Soe Phone Myint # Sein Than # Nyunt Tin # Tin May Htun == Controversy == In September 2016, the commission faced sustained criticism and questions regarding conduct of the commission arises when they brokered the compensation scheme to accept 5 million Kyat, approximately US$4,000, instead of pursuing legal action in the case of two girls tortured for 5 years as housemaids in Yangon. The Ava Tailor Shop owners reportedly forced the girls, currently 16 and 17 years old, to work without day-off and tortured over the course of 5 years: breaking their fingers and arms, and slicing with knife. On 22 September, MP Pyone Cho from Dawbon Township submitted an urgent proposal to take action against the Commission, and the Pyithu Hluttaw accepted to discuss further. On 6 October 2016, the President's Office issued the order statement, statement number 56/2016, allowing the following committee members to withdraw from their posts: U Zaw Win, Dr. Nyan Zaw, Dr. Than Nwe and Daw Mya Mya. ==See also== * Human rights in Burma ==References== Category:Government agencies of Myanmar Category:National human rights institutions Category:Human rights organisations based in Myanmar Category:2011 establishments in Myanmar ","title":"Myanmar National Human Rights Commission"},{"id":"35233122","text":"Qusheh Qui (, also Romanized as Q≈´sheh Q≈´‚Äôƒ´, Ghoosheh Ghoo‚Äôi, Gosheh K≈´yu, Qowsheh Q≈´‚Äôƒ´, and Q≈´shah Q≈´‚Äôƒ´) is a village in Hesar-e Valiyeasr Rural District, Central District, Avaj County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

The LRA has been frequently characterized as a front organization of the Communist Party. Jonathan Tasini was the Executive Director of the Labor Research Association in 2008. ==Organizational history== The Labor Research Association (LRA) was established late in 1927 by International Publishers president Alexander Trachtenberg and several individuals formerly associated with the Socialist Party's Rand School of Social Science, including Scott Nearing, Solon DeLeon, and Robert W.

It was also released on The Kinks live album One for the Road and on several greatest hits collections. The Knack covered the song on their 1980 album ...But the Little Girls Understand. ==Lyrics and music== The lyrics of \\"The Hard Way\\" were inspired by a real life incident that happened to Dave Davies, Ray's brother and The Kinks' guitarist. In the incident, Dave Davies was caned and expelled from William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School after cutting class and having sex with a classmate. On Schoolboys in Disgrace, a three song sequence beginning with \\"I'm in Disgrace,\\" continuing through \\"Headmaster\\" and concluding with \\"The Hard Way\\" covers a similar event in the life of the song's narrator Flash. \\"I'm in Disgrace\\" covers Flash's feelings about getting his girlfriend pregnant and in \\"Headmaster\\" Flash confesses his misdeeds to the headmaster and asks for mercy. In \\"The Hard Way,\\" the headmaster responds to the plea in the previous song. He berates and browbeats Flash. He starts by singing that \\"Boys like you were born to waste,\\" later singing that he is not fit to be anything more than a street sweeper. Allmusic critic Richard Gilliam sees the headmaster as a bigot who \\"believes that punishment and destruction of self-image are important elements in learning.\\" Author Thomas Kitts perceives a \\"psychosexual enjoyment\\" in the headmaster's words. Some of the lyrics, including the title, can be taken as double entendres. The music of the song is driven by a Dave Davies' power chord guitar riff, reminiscent of older Kinks songs such as \\"All Day and All of the Night\\" and \\"You Really Got Me.\\" Kitts believes that Davies' guitar part \\"mirrors the headmaster's sexual aggression.\\" Gilliam describes the percussion beat as \\"harsh.\\" Gilliam believes that opening riffs of \\"The Hard Way\\" were an influence on the sound of Devo. ==Recording== \\"The Hard Way\\" was recorded on September 22, 1975 at Konk Studios in London. Trombone overdubs were added on October 2, with John Beecham playing the trombone. ==Live performances== During the Schoolboys in Disgrace tour, the band performed in costume. For \\"The Hard Way,\\" lead singer Ray Davies wore a black gown and a grotesque mask, which had a long nose which Kitts compares to a phallus. Kinks drummer Mick Avory was \\"whipped\\" on stage at some performances of the song. At other performances, women on stage danced with canes. A live performance of \\"The Hard Way\\" was included on One for the Road. ==The Knack version== In 1980, The Knack covered \\"The Hard Way\\" for their second album, ...But the Little Girls Understand in 1980.

United Nations Division for the Advancement of Women. Retrieved March 10, 2013. Although considerations have been made by the Tongan parliament and government, ratification of CEDAW still remains unresolved. Factors determining the non- ratification of CEDAW are related to cultural protectionism of the Anga Fakatonga or \\"the Tongan way\\" of Tongan culture. Issues of Women's rights in Tonga include factors of women's land right, violence against women, political participation in parliament, and general cultural attitude towards the gender inequalities within Tonga. Many of the issues of gender inequalities within the Tongan culture are reinforced in the home and complex structures of the cultural family hierarchy. The issue of women's rights in Tonga is not entirely ignored within Tongan culture and government, and reformations have been considered. Women within Tonga have had the right to vote since the late Majesty Queen SƒÅlote Tupou III amended the constitution allowing this right in 1951. Other reformations and amendments to the Tongan Constitution have been considered. Violence against women in Tonga has been spotlighted and measures have been taken to better enforce laws protecting women against domestic violence, and spousal abuse. ==Gender inequalities in Tonga== According to the 2011 Human Development Report (HDR), Tonga ranked 90th out of 187 countries in terms of the Human Development Index (HDI). In terms of gender inequalities, a key indicator that stands out in the HDR is that in 2011, Tongan women constituted 3.4% of the elected representatives, which stands in stark contrast to the regional averages for East Asia and Pacific (20.2%) and small island developing countries (20.6%). Moreover, no woman was elected in the 2010 elections, albeit one who was appointed to a cabinet post. This poor political representation does not seem to stem from the low educational achievement of women, since, according to the 2011 HDR, 84% of women and 87.8% of men in Tonga had at least secondary education, which is well above the regional averages for East Asia and the Pacific and small island developing countries. There was disparity in women's labor force participation relative to men's participation rate: half the Tongan women were in the labor force compared to 75% of Tongan men. The population of males and females in the total Tongan population is nearly equal with the total male population at 52,350 male and 52,360 female. By this total population ration data, there is no visible data showing that there is a gender bias for sex selective births. ==Tonga and CEDAW== Along with Palau, Tonga is one of two countries in the Pacific region and one of six countries (other sovereign states: United States, Sudan, Somalia, and Iran) in the world which have yet to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).\\"Human Rights: 8. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women\\". United Nations Treaty Collections. Retrieved March 10, 2013. CEDAW is considered by many to be an international bill of rights for women, and has aimed to create universal ideals for women's rights and gender equality. In September 2009, the Legislative Assembly voted 18 to 1 with 4 abstentions not to ratify CEDAW.\\"Tongan Parliament decides not to ratify CEDAW\\" (Press Release, 18 September 2009), para 3. Retrieved 2011-06-21. In announcing the decision not to ratify, the Tongan Prime Minister stated that ratification would cut across our cultural and social heritage that makes up the Tongan way of life. Furthermore, Tonga did not want to ratify with reservations or undertake a 'ratification of convenience.' ‚ÄòOfa Likiliki has been an advocate for the ratification of CEDAW for the past 11 years. On 9 March 2015, in a historical decision the Tongan government agreed to ratify the Convention with reservations. Though the signing was to be with reservations, Likiliki saw the move as a positive one which will signify that the government is amenable to making changes.  Tongan culture and CEDAW  Tonga's rich and ancient culture dates back an estimated 3000 years when the Tongan archipelago was inhabited. Tongan culture and society have evolved over many thousands of years creating the back bone of Tongan culture. Today Tongan culture and the Anga Fakatonga 'Ofa, Guttenbeil- Likiliki. \\"Advancing Women's Representation in Tonga\\". Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. 2006. Retrieved March 10, 2013. (Tongan way of life) is protected and preserved by lawmakers, government, and monarchy within Tonga. Great respect for the Anga Fakatonga is also given by Tongan society in protection of culture and heritage. The Anga Fakatonga has preserved a rich and ancient culture that has codified law and social norms within today's current Tongan society. The Anga Fakatonga has been culturally protected and is rarely open to outside influence and intervention. In regards to women's rights and ratification of CEDAW (The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women) the Anga Fakatonga has clashed with some of CEDAW reformation measures and has been a factor in the current non-ratification of CEDAW. Issues with Tonga's current laws and the Anga Fakatonga's adherence include women's land rights and loose enforcement of violence against women laws. Despite the perceived oppression of women in Tonga due to the non-ratification of CEDAW, women do have an important place in Tongan society.[citation needed] ==Tongan social structure== Kin-based stratification Traditional Tongan culture has ancient traditions including a \\"kin-based stratification\\", or allocation of power based on age, sexual orientation, and birth order. The Api, or basic order of Tongan society, is based at the root of oldest male control over a family group. This control, or leadership, is a responsibility with the family group, but it also gives power over decision making of things such as resource allocation, family labor duties, and discipline. Family decision making Decision making traditionally has been made by the father/husband. Imbedded deeply in the Tongan cultural framework, this patriarchal, or 'Ulumotu'a (oldest male) leadership places decisions final say with the male leader of any given Tongan family. The fahu, the highest female in social structure, or oldest sister in the family structure, has title given but traditionally does not have any decision making power.Spickard, Paul; Rondilla, Joanne L.; Wright, Debbie Hippolite (2002). Pacific Diaspora. Oahu: University of Hawai'i Press. pp. 271-272. . It could be argued that an increase in educated male and female population couples has balanced the decision making shared between both husband and wife. However, in extended family structure, the traditional kin based stratification is usually followed. Article 12  The Tongan Government has made recent efforts and commitments in reform and acceptance of some of the rights promoted by CEDAW. CEDAW endorsed convention, the Convention on the Rights of the Child-Ensuring the Girl Child's Participation which (article 12), is to encourage adults to listen to the opinions of children and involve them in decision making.\\"Fact sheet: The right to participation\\". Unicef. Retrieved March 10, 2013. \\"This does not give authority over adults and does not interfere with parents' rights and responsibilities in relations to matters affecting their children. The Convention recognizes that a child's participation in decision making must occur in a manner that is appropriate to the child's age and maturity.\\" ==Women's land rights== Historically the Kingdom of Tonga has been centered on cultivation and farming. Early explorers recorded accounts speak of beautiful gardens planted symmetrically and carefully cared for. Today much of Tonga, especially in remote rural areas and scattered on the many islands of Tonga, still rely on cultivation for livelihood. This cultivation technique historically and presently has revolved around the importance of women and their responsibility for much of the labor burden associated with it. Tongan women's physical participation includes growing and marketing the agriculture produce. Although women have been pivotal in the cultivation and use of land, women still today, under the constitution of The Kingdom of Tonga cannot own land. If a woman in Tonga wishes to use land for any purpose, including for cultivation, they cannot buy land but must only lease land for its temporary use. One benefit to women in Tonga is that they cannot own land and therefore do not have to pay property taxes (this argument has been used in some writings as pro-women).[citation needed] Land ownership reformations The Ministry of Women's Affairs in Tonga will be enacted and created by the end of 2012 and has been announced (March 2012). This will open up options, and possible conversation about women's rights, to review and possibly amend the current constitution in regards to the current women's land rights in Tonga. As a possible move towards an amendment of current constitutional restrictions of women and ownership of land, Tonga could take a huge step forward towards the ratification of the UN Convention of the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Independent of compliance and possible ratification of CEDAW, through an amendment of the current constitutional laws, it is thought that women's possible land ownership will help progress women's rights on a large scale.\\"Tonga launches violence against women initiatives\\". Pacific Islands Development Program/East-West Center. March 10, 2012. ==Violence against women== In many cases, violence against women has gone unnoticed, and is accepted by both men and women, and is rarely prosecuted. Marital rape was criminalized in 2013.Section 29 of the Family Protection Act 2013 reads: \\"Subject to clause 12 of the Constitution, in addition to liability under this Act, a respondent may also be prosecuted under other criminal laws for the time being in force for his acts if the facts disclose the commission of a separate criminal offence under those provisions. Note: For example, (without limitation), assault, offences endangering life and health, grievous bodily harm, rape, other sexual offences, murder and manslaughter and sexual exploitation through people trafficking and smuggling\\" Reform in protecting women The Solicitor General, 'Aminiasi Kefu pledged in early March 2012 initiatives set to protect women. These initiatives include a formal Bill on Domestic Violence, and a bill addressing Tongan women's land rights drafted in part by the Ministry of Women's Affairs. A pledge was also made that adoption of a \\"no drop policy\\" be enacted for all cases of domestic violence pending an investigation, and prosecution if conclusive evidence is found of bodily harm, indecent assault, incest or rape. The Australian High Commissioner to Tonga, HE Mr. Thomas Roth pledged a $1 million UN Women Pacific Fund to End Violence Against Women in March 2012. HE Mr. Thomas Roth said in an announcement of the funds, \\"UN Women Pacific Fund to End Violence Against Women\\" would be used to establish grants and facilitate training services for Tongan organizations to promote their work to eliminate violence against women\\". In 2013 the Tongan legislature passed a Family Protection Bill which gave police the ability to issue immediate protection orders, establishes procedures to informing victims of their rights and procedures, and created a committee to monitor implementation of the bill. ==Women's political participation in Tonga== Other issues of Tongan women's rights include women's low participation in government parliament. The parliament is the governing body that has historically and even in recent years rejected CEDAW, in an effort to protect the Anga Fakatonga. There are some male political participants including the former Prime Minister Lord Tu'ivakano, who have said that they support the CEDAW. However, there is an overwhelming attitude in Parliament and in the general political environment that there are more pressing issues including political reform and economic development that have placed women's rights on the back burner. Women however do have a voting voice as of 1951 when the late Majesty Queen Salote Tupou III amended the constitution allowing this right. Women, by this amendment, were also allowed participation in parliament, however from the time that women were given the opportunity, only four have been voted in as a voice for the people on Parliament as People's Representatives in the Legislative Assembly. Political progression Until 2006, women have not been appointed to a Ministerial Position. In May 2006, Solicitor General 'Alisi Taumoepeau was appointed Minister of Justice. Under the 1875 Tongan Constitution, women cannot be voted into one of the nine Nobel seats or two Governors' seats as these aristocratic positions can currently only be inherited by men. Aside from the nine seats in Parliament and the two Governors' seats, there are twelve seats reserved for the Minister of the Crown which are all reserved and appointed by the King. Until the recent appointment of Alisi Taumoepeau in 2006 there had not been any Women appointed to Ministerial Positions. Cultural attitudes and social norms Of the 33 seats in the house reserved for Peoples Representatives, only 9 represent any hope of women getting in Parliament as the other 23 seats are assigned and/or can only be held by men. Women still struggle to gain any access to these 9 available seats due to social norms and cultural attitudes. These social norms and cultural attitudes do not come only from the male population, but an attitude of women in Tongan society, which consequently has slowed this current progression of women's participation as a People's Representative in Tongan Parliament. This is apparent in the overwhelming vote-in of male candidates over female candidates even though women have had voting rights since 1951. The women still tend to vote for a male dominate government within Tonga. CEDAW and political goals Article 7 of CEDAW states that ‚ÄúState Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the political and public life of the country and, in particular, shall ensure women,on equal terms with men, the right: (b) \\"To participate in the formulation of the government policy and the implementation thereof and to hold public office and perform all public functions at all levels of government\\".

Burgos, c. 1304 - Medina del Campo, 1355) was a Spanish noble baron in the service of the Kingdom of Castile and a member of the Order of Santiago. He was the head of the House of Villegas and a descendant of the houses of Cevallos and of Lucio. As the majorat of his own heraldic crest, he received titles over Villegas, Manquillos, Castillo Pedroso, Mo√±ux, Pedrosa del P√°ramo, Manciles, Valdeg√≥mez and the palace of Sasam√≥n. For his service in the First Castilian Civil War, and his role in the destruction of the Blanche of Bourbon league he received the castle of Caracena, and was named high adelantado of Castile in 1354. A year later, Peter of Castile would execute him in the village of Medina del Campo. == Family Origins == Pedro Ruiz de Villegas II was born in the city of Burgos in 1304. He was the son of Ruy P√©rez de Villegas I and Teresa Gonz√°lez de Cevallos, son in law of Garci Lasso de la Vega I. His full name was Pedro Ruiz de Villegas Lucio y de Cevallos, IV Se√±or de la Casa de Villegas y de diversas baron√≠as. His father, Ruy P√©rez de Villegas I and Teresa Gonz√°lez Cevallos had four children: Order of Santiago. * Pedro Ruiz de Villegas II * Sancho Ruiz de Villegas ¬´El Segund√≥n¬ª who married Mar√≠a Alfonso. * Lope Ruiz de Villegas, father of Alfonso L√≥pez de Villegas. * Mar√≠a Ruiz de Villegas who married Lope D√≠az Alcalde. == Life == Knight of the Band and Marriage Rendition of the Knights of the Band Symbol. In 1332, the King Alfonso XI of Castile founded the Order of the Band with the intent of consolidating his power over the unruly nobility of Castile. He ordered that certain nobles were to dress like him with white cloths and a crimson taffeta band that he had designed himself. The members were made to follow a rigid etiquette behavior, to participate in jousts, to be very solitary and to remain, above all, loyal to the King. It was thus that Pedro Ruiz de Villegas II was named a Knight of the Order of the Band along with his younger brother Lope Ruiz de Villegas.Lope Ruiz de Villegas hab√≠a fallecido antes de realizar el libro Becerro de Castilla, por lo cual, figura como se√±or de behetr√≠a su hijo Alfonso L√≥pez de Villegas. In 1348 he married Teresa Gonz√°lez de la Vega (n. c. 1328), daughter of Garci Lasso de la Vega I who was a noble from Cantabria. On March 19, 1351, Pedro and Teresa sold most of their properties to their paternal uncle, Garci Lasso de la Vega II. In early 1350, Tello de Castilla, son of Alfonso XI and Leonor de Guzm√°n, inherited various properties from his father on his 13th birthday. Tello appointed Villegas as the chief administrator of all his properties, a move that would cost Villegas dearly when some of these properties were lost in the subsequent Castilian Civil War. First Castilian Civil War Coronation of Peter of Castile Alfonso XI of Castile died on the 26th of March, 1350. Upon his death, Prince Pedro assumed the throne at a mere 16 years of age. Peter abandoned his father's agenda of Reconquista and pursued a policy of cutting the powers of the Spanish nobles and concentrating power in the crown of Castile and the bourgeoisie. Peter also took other unpopular steps such as the protection of the minority Jewish community. When the nobles rebelled in defense of their privileges, the King responded with severity and executed various nobles, including the father of Pedro Ruiz de Villegas II. To inflame matters, later in 1351, the Queen Dowager Mar√≠a de Portugal, ordered the assassination of the former lover of King Alfonso XI, Leonor de Guzm√°n who had been held prisoner in Talavera de la Reina. She had previously given birth to the twins Fadrique Alfonso de Castilla and Enrique II de Castilla, the latter of which had secretly married Juana Manuel de Villena y N√∫√±ez de Lara in July 1350. This murder further enraged the aristocracy and ignited the Castilian Civil War. As Pedro Ruiz de Villegas II was in the service of Tello de Castilla, who had joined the rebellion against the King, he was likewise branded an enemy of the crown. Assassination In 1355. Peter of Castile consolidated himself in Segovia and later in Burgos where he oversaw the suppression of the remaining rebels. In April of the same year, by mandate of the King, Pedro Ruiz de Villegas II was assassinated while he slept along with his squire in the village of Medina del Campo. ==References== * \\"Historia de Cantabria\\" (por Consejer√≠a de Cultura y Deporte). * \\"Revista Hidalgu√≠a\\" (a√±o 1979). * \\"Alrededor de los Parientes en Espa√±a de los siglos XVI y XVII\\" (de Augustin Redondo). * \\"Prueba de Hidalgu√≠a\\" del marqu√©s de Paradas, Fernando de Villegas (1675). * \\"Nobiliario‚Ä¶\\" (manuscrito de Jer√≥nimo de Aponte). * \\"Anales de Arag√≥n\\" (de Zurita) * Padr√≥n antiguo de C√≥breces (s.

It is flat and bordered on the west by the Industrial zone of MIN and the two Roma neighborhoods \\"Stocni trg\\" and \\"Jevrejsko groblje\\"(Jewish cemetery), on the south-east by the railway (Belgrade - Ni≈°) and two neighborhoods of \\"Staro groblje\\"(Old cemetery) and \\"Kicevo\\", and on the north by the Ni≈°ava river.The official site of the City of Ni≈° ==History== Built mostly after 1878, Crni put was the location of the first locomotive servicing workshop in Serbia.The etymology and the history In the late 19th century, mud extended to the edges of the city limits and as a result the workshop poured slag from coal production onto the surrounding roads, which became completely black. This led to the neighborhood being named Crni put, (literally \\"black road\\"). During World War II this neighborhood was heavily bombed, first in 1941 by Nazi Germany, than in 1944 by the Allies. Ni≈° was also bombarded during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, when it was home to a radio relay station, an airfield, and a fuel depot. 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia ==Characteristics and future development== The neighborhood is partly industrial, partly residential, and partly commercial. Institute for Urban Planning and Development of Nis, 2010 - 2025, Synthesis After World War II the city government decided to reserve the area of this neighborhood for industry and banned construction of any residential buildings. After the victory of the coalition of democratic opposition in the local elections in Ni≈° in 1996,Europa World Year, Book 2, 2004 the new city government revised that decision in 1997, partially authorizing the construction of residential buildings and dislocation of open merchandise markets into this neighborhood.

This concept is closely related to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), which attempts to locate intelligent life as opposed to analyzing the implications of contact with that life. The potential changes from extraterrestrial contact could vary greatly in magnitude and type, based on the extraterrestrial civilization's level of technological advancement, degree of benevolence or malevolence, and level of mutual comprehension between itself and humanity. The medium through which humanity is contacted, be it electromagnetic radiation, direct physical interaction, extraterrestrial artifact, or otherwise, may also influence the results of contact. Incorporating these factors, various systems have been created to assess the implications of extraterrestrial contact. The implications of extraterrestrial contact, particularly with a technologically superior civilization, have often been likened to the meeting of two vastly different human cultures on Earth, a historical precedent being the Columbian Exchange. Such meetings have generally led to the destruction of the civilization receiving contact (as opposed to the \\"contactor\\", which initiates contact), and therefore destruction of human civilization is a possible outcome. Extraterrestrial contact is also analogous to the numerous encounters between non-human native and invasive species occupying the same ecological niche. However, the absence of verified public contact to date means tragic consequences are still largely speculative. ==Background== Search for extraterrestrial intelligence The alt=An image of the Arecibo messageTo detect extraterrestrial civilizations with radio telescopes, one must identify an artificial, coherent signal against a background of various natural phenomena that also produce radio waves. Telescopes capable of this include the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, the Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek, California and the new Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope in China. Various programs to detect extraterrestrial intelligence have had government funding in the past. Project Cyclops was commissioned by NASA in the 1970s to investigate the most effective way to search for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial sources, but the report's recommendations were set aside in favor of the much more modest approach of Messaging to Extra- Terrestrial Intelligence (METI), the sending of messages that intelligent extraterrestrial beings might intercept. NASA then drastically reduced funding for SETI programs, which have since turned to private donations to continue their search. With the discovery in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of numerous extrasolar planets, some of which may be habitable, governments have once more become interested in funding new programs. In 2006 the European Space Agency launched COROT, the first spacecraft dedicated to the search for exoplanets, and in 2009 NASA launched the Kepler space observatory for the same purpose. By February 2013 Kepler had detected 105 of the confirmed exoplanets, and one of them, Kepler-22b, is potentially habitable. After it was discovered, the SETI Institute resumed the search for an intelligent extraterrestrial civilization, focusing on Keplers candidate planets, with funding from the United States Air Force. Newly discovered planets, particularly ones that are potentially habitable, have enabled SETI and METI programs to refocus projects for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. In 2009 A Message From Earth (AMFE) was sent toward the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains two potentially habitable planets, the confirmed Gliese 581d and the more habitable but unconfirmed Gliese 581g. In the SETILive project, which began in 2012, human volunteers analyze data from the Allen Telescope Array to search for possible alien signals that computers might miss because of terrestrial radio interference. The data for the study is obtained by observing Kepler target stars with the radio telescope. In addition to radio-based methods, some projects, such as SEVENDIP (Search for Extraterrestrial Visible Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations) at the University of California, Berkeley, are using other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum to search for extraterrestrial signals. Various other projects are not searching for coherent signals, but want to rather use electromagnetic radiation to find other evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, such as megascale astroengineering projects. Several signals, such as the Wow! signal, have been detected in the history of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, but none have yet been confirmed as being of intelligent origin. Impact assessment The implications of extraterrestrial contact depend on the method of discovery, the nature of the extraterrestrial beings, and their location relative to the Earth. Considering these factors, the Rio Scale has been devised in order to provide a more quantitative picture of the results of extraterrestrial contact. More specifically, the scale gauges whether communication was conducted through radio, the information content of any messages, and whether discovery arose from a deliberately beamed message (and if so, whether the detection was the result of a specialized SETI effort or through general astronomical observations) or by the detection of occurrences such as radiation leakage from astroengineering installations. The question of whether or not a purported extraterrestrial signal has been confirmed as authentic, and with what degree of confidence, will also influence the impact of the contact. The Rio Scale was modified in 2011 to include a consideration of whether contact was achieved through an interstellar message or through a physical extraterrestrial artifact, with a suggestion that the definition of artifact be expanded to include \\"technosignatures\\", including all indications of intelligent extraterrestrial life other than the interstellar radio messages sought by traditional SETI programs. A study by astronomer Steven J. Dick at the United States Naval Observatory considered the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact by analyzing events of similar significance in the history of science. The study argues that the impact would be most strongly influenced by the information content of the message received, if any. It distinguishes short-term and long-term impact. Seeing radio-based contact as a more plausible scenario than a visit from extraterrestrial spacecraft, the study rejects the commonly stated analogy of European colonization of the Americas as an accurate model for information-only contact, preferring events of profound scientific significance, such as the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions, as more predictive of how humanity might be impacted by extraterrestrial contact. The physical distance between the two civilizations has also been used to assess the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact. Historical examples show that the greater the distance, the less the contacted civilization perceives a threat to itself and its culture. Therefore, contact occurring within the Solar System, and especially in the immediate vicinity of Earth, is likely to be the most disruptive and negative for humanity. On a smaller scale, people close to the epicenter of contact would experience a greater effect than would those living farther away, and a contact having multiple epicenters would cause a greater shock than one with a single epicenter. Space scientists Martin Dominik and John Zarnecki state that in the absence of any data on the nature of extraterrestrial intelligence, one must predict the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact on the basis of generalizations encompassing all life and of analogies with history. (audio supplement) The beliefs of the general public about the effect of extraterrestrial contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, inter alia, the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that students took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful. Psychologists Douglas Vakoch and Yuh-shiow Lee conducted a survey to assess people's reactions to receiving a message from extraterrestrials, including their judgments about likelihood that extraterrestrials would be malevolent. \\"People who view the world as a hostile place are more likely to think extraterrestrials will be hostile,\\" Vakoch told USA Today. Post- detection protocols Various protocols have been drawn up detailing a course of action for scientists and governments after extraterrestrial contact. Post- detection protocols must address three issues: what to do in the first weeks after receiving a message from an extraterrestrial source; whether or not to send a reply; and analyzing the long-term consequences of the message received. No post-detection protocol, however, is binding under national or international law, and Dominik and Zarnecki consider the protocols likely to be ignored if contact occurs. One of the first post-detection protocols, the \\"Declaration of Principles for Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence\\", was created by the SETI Permanent Committee of the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA). It was later approved by the Board of Trustees of the IAA and by the International Institute of Space Law, and still later by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the Committee on Space Research, the International Union of Radio Science, and others. It was subsequently endorsed by most researchers involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, including the SETI Institute. The Declaration of Principles contains the following broad provisions: # Any person or organization detecting a signal should try to verify that it is likely to be of intelligent origin before announcing it. # The discoverer of a signal should, for the purposes of independent verification, communicate with other signatories of the Declaration before making a public announcement, and should also inform their national authorities. # Once a given astronomical observation has been determined to be a credible extraterrestrial signal, the astronomical community should be informed through the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams of the IAU. The Secretary-General of the United Nations and various other global scientific unions should also be informed. # Following confirmation of an observation's extraterrestrial origin, news of the discovery should be made public. The discoverer has the right to make the first public announcement. # All data confirming the discovery should be published to the international scientific community and stored in an accessible form as permanently as possible. # Should evidence for extraterrestrial intelligence take the form of electromagnetic signals, the Secretary-General of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) should be contacted, and may request in the next ITU Weekly Circular to minimize terrestrial use of the electromagnetic frequency bands in which the signal was detected. # Neither the discoverer nor anyone else should respond to an observed extraterrestrial intelligence; doing so requires international agreement under separate procedures. # The SETI Permanent Committee of the IAA and Commission 51 of the IAU should continually review procedures regarding detection of extraterrestrial intelligence and management of data related to such discoveries. A committee comprising members from various international scientific unions, and other bodies designated by the committee, should regulate continued SETI research. A separate \\"Proposed Agreement on the Sending of Communications to Extraterrestrial Intelligence\\" was subsequently created. It proposes an international commission, membership of which would be open to all interested nations, to be constituted on detection of extraterrestrial intelligence. This commission would decide whether to send a message to the extraterrestrial intelligence, and if so, would determine the contents of the message on the basis of principles such as justice, respect for cultural diversity, honesty, and respect for property and territory. The draft proposes to forbid the sending of any message by an individual nation or organization without the permission of the commission, and suggests that, if the detected intelligence poses a danger to human civilization, the United Nations Security Council should authorize any message to extraterrestrial intelligence. However, this proposal, like all others, has not been incorporated into national or international law. Paul Davies, a member of the SETI Post-Detection Taskgroup, has stated that post-detection protocols, calling for international consultation before taking any major steps regarding the detection, are unlikely to be followed by astronomers, who would put the advancement of their careers over the word of a protocol that is not part of national or international law. ==Contact scenarios and considerations== Scientific literature and science fiction have put forward various models of the ways in which extraterrestrial and human civilizations might interact. Their predictions range widely, from sophisticated civilizations that could advance human civilization in many areas to imperial powers that might draw upon the forces necessary to subjugate humanity. Some theories suggest that an extraterrestrial civilization could be advanced enough to dispense with biology, living instead inside of advanced computers. The implications of discovery depend very much on the level of aggressiveness of the civilization interacting with humanity, its ethics, and how much human and extraterrestrial biologies have in common. These factors will govern the quantity and type of dialogue that can take place. The question of whether contact is physical or through electromagnetic signals will also govern the magnitude of the long- term implications of contact. In the case of communication using electromagnetic signals, the long silence between the reception of one message and another would mean that the content of any message would particularly affect the consequences of contact, as would the extent of mutual comprehension. Friendly civilizations Many writers have speculated on the ways in which a friendly civilization might interact with humankind. Albert Harrison, a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California, Davis, thought that a highly advanced civilization might teach humanity such things as a physical theory of everything, how to use zero-point energy, or how to travel faster than light. They suggest that collaboration with such a civilization could initially be in the arts and humanities before moving to the hard sciences, and even that artists may spearhead collaboration. Seth D. Baum, of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, and others consider that the greater longevity of cooperative civilizations in comparison to uncooperative and aggressive ones might render extraterrestrial civilizations in general more likely to aid humanity. In contrast to these views, however, Paolo Musso, a member of the SETI Permanent Study Group of the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, took the view that extraterrestrial civilizations possess, like humans, a morality driven not entirely by altruism but for individual benefit as well, thus leaving open the possibility that at least some extraterrestrial civilizations are hostile. alt=An image of the explosion of the nuclear bomb Ivy Mike.Futurist Allen Tough suggests that an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization, recalling its own past of war and plunder and knowing that it possesses superweapons that could destroy it, would be likely to try to help humans rather than to destroy them. He identifies three approaches that a friendly civilization might take to help humanity: * Intervention only to avert catastrophe: this would involve occasional limited intervention to stop events that could destroy human civilization completely, such as nuclear war or asteroid impact. * Advice and action with consent: under this approach, the extraterrestrials would be more closely involved in terrestrial affairs, advising world leaders and acting with their consent to protect against danger. * Forcible corrective action: the extraterrestrials could require humanity to reduce major risks against its will, intending to help humans advance to the next stage of civilization. Tough considers advising and acting only with consent to be a more likely choice than the forceful option. While coercive aid may be possible, and advanced extraterrestrials would recognize their own practices as superior to those of humanity, it may be unlikely that this method would be used in cultural cooperation. Lemarchand suggests that instruction of a civilization in its \\"technological adolescence\\", such as humanity, would probably focus on morality and ethics rather than on science and technology, to ensure that the civilization did not destroy itself with technology it was not yet ready to use. According to Tough, it is unlikely that the avoidance of immediate dangers and prevention of future catastrophes would be conducted through radio, as these tasks would demand constant surveillance and quick action. However, cultural cooperation might take place through radio or a space probe in the Solar System, as radio waves could be used to communicate information about advanced technologies and cultures to humanity. Even if an ancient and advanced extraterrestrial civilization wished to help humanity, humans could suffer from a loss of identity and confidence due to the technological and cultural prowess of the extraterrestrial civilization. However, a friendly civilization may calibrate its contact with humanity in such a way as to minimize unintended consequences. Michael A. G. Michaud suggests that a friendly and advanced extraterrestrial civilization may even avoid all contact with an emerging intelligent species like humanity, to ensure that the less advanced civilization can develop naturally at its own pace; this is known as the zoo hypothesis. Hostile civilizations Science fiction films often depict humans successfully repelling alien invasions, but scientists more often take the view that an extraterrestrial civilization with sufficient power to reach the Earth would be able to destroy human civilization with minimal effort. Operations that are enormous on a human scale, such as destroying all major population centers on a planet, bombarding a planet with deadly neutron radiation, or even traveling to another planetary system in order to lay waste to it, may be important tools for a hostile and totalitarian civilization. Deardorff speculates that a small proportion of the intelligent life forms in the galaxy may be aggressive, but the actual aggressiveness or benevolence of the civilizations would cover a wide spectrum, with some civilizations \\"policing\\" others. According to Harrison and Dick, hostile extraterrestrial life may indeed be rare in the Universe, just as belligerent and autocratic nations on Earth have been the ones that lasted for the shortest periods of time, and humanity is seeing a shift away from these characteristics in its own sociopolitical systems. In addition, the causes of war may be diminished greatly for a civilization with access to the galaxy, as there are prodigious quantities of natural resources in space accessible without resort to violence. SETI researcher Carl Sagan believed that a civilization with the technological prowess needed to reach the stars and come to Earth must have transcended war to be able to avoid self- destruction. Representatives of such a civilization would treat humanity with dignity and respect, and humanity, with its relatively backward technology, would have no choice but to reciprocate. Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute, disagrees, stating that the finite quantity of resources in the galaxy would cultivate aggression in any intelligent species, and that an explorer civilization that would want to contact humanity would be aggressive. Similarly, Ragbir Bhathal claims that since the laws of evolution would be the same on another habitable planet as they are on Earth, an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization may have the motivation to colonize humanity, much as British colonists did to Aboriginal Australians. Disputing these analyses, David Brin states that while an extraterrestrial civilization may have an imperative to act for no benefit to itself, it would be na√Øve to suggest that such a trait would be prevalent throughout the galaxy. Brin points to the fact that in many moral systems on Earth, such as the Aztec or Carthaginian one, non-military killing has been accepted and even \\"exalted\\" by society, and further mentions that such acts are not confined to humans but can be found throughout the animal kingdom. Baum et al. speculate that highly advanced civilizations are unlikely to come to Earth to enslave humans, as the achievement of their level of advancement would have required them to solve the problems of labor and resources by other means, such as creating a sustainable environment and using mechanized labor. Moreover, humans may be an unsuitable food source for extraterrestrials because of marked differences in biochemistry. For example, the chirality of molecules used by terrestrial biota may differ from those used by extraterrestrial beings. Douglas Vakoch argues that transmitting intentional signals does not increase the risk of an alien invasion, contrary to concerns raised by British cosmologist Stephen Hawking, because \\"any civilization that has the ability to travel between the stars can already pick up our accidental radio and TV leakage\\". Politicians have also commented on the likely human reaction to contact with hostile species. In his 1987 speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Ronald Reagan said, \\"I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world.\\" Equally advanced and more advanced civilizations It is suggested that technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilization would probably be ethically advanced as well and would not attempt projects with severe ecological implications for other species, like the construction of a alt=A Dyson sphere Robert Freitas speculated in 1978 that the technological advancement and energy usage of a civilization, measured either relative to another civilization or in absolute terms by its rating on the Kardashev scale, may play an important role in the result of extraterrestrial contact. Given the infeasibility of interstellar space flight for civilizations at a technological level similar to that of humanity, interactions between such civilizations would have to take place by radio. Because of the long transit times of radio waves between stars, such interactions would not lead to the establishment of diplomatic relations, nor any significant future interaction at all, between the two civilizations. According to Freitas, direct contact with civilizations significantly more advanced than humanity would have to take place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space. Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity. However much planning an extraterrestrial civilization may do before contacting humanity, the humans may experience great shock and terror on their arrival, especially as they would lack any understanding of the contacting civilization. Ben Finney compares the situation to that of the tribespeople of New Guinea, an island that was settled fifty thousand years ago during the last glacial period but saw little contact with the outside world until the arrival of European colonial powers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The huge difference between the indigenous stone-age society and the Europeans' technical civilization caused unexpected behaviors among the native populations known as cargo cults: to coax the gods into bringing them the technology that the Europeans possessed, the natives created wooden \\"radio stations\\" and \\"airstrips\\" as a form of sympathetic magic. Finney argues that humanity may misunderstand the true meaning of an extraterrestrial transmission to Earth, much as the people of New Guinea could not understand the source of modern goods and technologies. He concludes that the results of extraterrestrial contact will become known over the long term with rigorous study, rather than as fast, sharp events briefly making newspaper headlines. Billingham has suggested that a civilization which is far more technologically advanced than humanity is also likely to be culturally and ethically advanced, and would therefore be unlikely to conduct astroengineering projects that would harm human civilization. Such projects could include Dyson spheres, which completely enclose stars and capture all energy coming from them. Even if well within the capability of an advanced civilization and providing an enormous amount of energy, such a project would not be undertaken. For similar reasons, such civilizations would not readily give humanity the knowledge required to build such devices. Nevertheless, the existence of such capabilities would at least show that civilizations have survived \\"technological adolescence\\". Despite the caution that such an advanced civilization would exercise in dealing with the less mature human civilization, Sagan imagined that an advanced civilization might send those on Earth an Encyclop√¶dia Galactica describing the sciences and cultures of many extraterrestrial societies. Whether an advanced extraterrestrial civilization would send humanity a decipherable message is a matter of debate in itself. Sagan argued that a highly advanced extraterrestrial civilization would bear in mind that they were communicating with a relatively primitive one and therefore would try to ensure that the receiving civilization would be able to understand the message. Marvin Minsky believed that aliens might think similarly to humans because of shared constraints, permitting communication. Arguing against this view, astronomer Guillermo Lemarchand stated that an advanced civilization would probably encrypt a message with high information content, such as an Encyclop√¶dia Galactica, in order to ensure that only other ethically advanced civilizations would be able to understand it. Douglas Vakoch assumes it may take some time to decode any message, telling ABC News that \\"I don't think we're going to understand immediately what they have to say.\\" \\"There‚Äôs going to be a lot of guesswork in trying to interpret another civilization,\\" he told Science Friday, adding that \\"in some ways, any message we get from an extraterrestrial will be like a cosmic Rorschach ink blot test.\\" Interstellar groups of civilizations Given the age of the galaxy, Harrison surmises that there exist several \\"galactic clubs\\", groupings of civilizations from across the galaxy. Such clubs could begin as loose confederations or alliances, eventually developing into powerful unions of many civilizations. If humanity could enter into a dialogue with one extraterrestrial civilization, it might be able to join such a galactic club. As more extraterrestrial civilizations, or unions thereof, are found, these could also become assimilated into such a club. Sebastian von Hoerner has suggested that entry into a galactic club may be a way for humanity to handle the culture shock arising from contact with an advanced extraterrestrial civilization. Whether a broad spectrum of civilizations from many places in the galaxy would even be able to cooperate is disputed by Michaud, who states that civilizations with huge differences in the technologies and resources at their command \\"may not consider themselves even remotely equal\\". It is unlikely that humanity would meet the basic requirements for membership at its current low level of technological advancement. A galactic club may, William Hamilton speculates, set extremely high entrance requirements that are unlikely to be met by less advanced civilizations. When two Canadian astronomers argued that they potentially discovered 234 extraterrestrial civilizationsDiscovery of peculiar periodic spectral modulations in a small fraction of solar type stars, Ermanno Borra and Eric Trottier, 2016 through analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database, Douglas Vakoch doubted their explanation for their findings, noting that it would be unusual for all of these stars to pulse at exactly the same frequency unless they were part of a coordinated network: \\"If you take a step back,\\" he said, \\"that would mean you have 234 independent stars that all decided to transmit the exact same way.\\" Michaud suggests that an interstellar grouping of civilizations might take the form of an empire, which need not necessarily be a force for evil, but may provide for peace and security throughout its jurisdiction. Owing to the distances between the stars, such an empire would not necessarily maintain control solely by military force, but may rather tolerate local cultures and institutions to the extent that these would not pose a threat to the central imperial authority. Such tolerance may, as has happened historically on Earth, extend to allowing nominal self-rule of specific regions by existing institutions, while maintaining that area as a puppet or client state to accomplish the aims of the imperial power. However, particularly advanced powers may use methods, including faster-than-light travel, to make centralized administration more effective. In contrast to the belief that an extraterrestrial civilization would want to establish an empire, ƒÜirkoviƒá proposes that an extraterrestrial civilization would maintain equilibrium rather than expand outward. In such an equilibrium, a civilization would only colonize a small number of stars, aiming to maximize efficiency rather than to expand massive and unsustainable imperial structures. This contrasts with the classic Kardashev Type III civilization, which has access to the energy output of an entire galaxy and is not subject to any limits on its future expansion. According to this view, advanced civilizations may not resemble the classic examples in science fiction, but might more closely reflect the small, independent Greek city-states, with an emphasis on cultural rather than territorial growth. Extraterrestrial artifacts alt=An extraterrestrial robotic spacecraftAn extraterrestrial civilization may choose to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may take a long time to reach the Solar System, once there they would be able to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System. Although faster-than-light travel has been seriously considered by physicists such as Miguel Alcubierre, Tough speculates that the enormous amount of energy required to achieve such speeds under currently proposed mechanisms means that robotic probes traveling at conventional speeds will still have an advantage for various applications. 2013 research at NASA's Johnson Space Center, however, shows that faster-than- light travel with the Alcubierre drive requires dramatically less energy than previously thought, needing only about 1 metric ton of exotic mass-energy to move a spacecraft at 10 times the speed of light, in contrast to previous estimates that stated that only a Jupiter-mass object would contain sufficient energy to power a faster-than-light spacecraft.The original article stated that the mass-energy required would be roughly equal to that of the Voyager 1 spacecraft, and the mass of that spacecraft itself is, according to NASA, currently about 733 kg. Therefore, \\"about one metric ton\\" was used in the text. According to Tough, an extraterrestrial civilization might want to send various types of information to humanity by means of artifacts, such as an Encyclop√¶dia Galactica, containing the wisdom of countless extraterrestrial cultures, or perhaps an invitation to engage in diplomacy with them. A civilization that sees itself on the brink of decline might use the abilities it still possesses to send probes throughout the galaxy, with its cultures, values, religions, sciences, technologies, and laws, so that these may not die along with the civilization itself. Freitas finds numerous reasons why interstellar probes may be a preferred method of communication among extraterrestrial civilizations wishing to make contact with Earth. A civilization aiming to learn more about the distribution of life within the galaxy might, he speculates, send probes to a large number of star systems, rather than using radio, as one cannot ensure a response by radio but can (he says) ensure that probes will return to their sender with data on the star systems they survey. Furthermore, probes would enable the surveying of non- intelligent populations, or those not yet capable of space navigation (like humans before the 20th century), as well as intelligent populations that might not wish to provide information about themselves and their planets to extraterrestrial civilizations. In addition, the greater energy required to send living beings rather than a robotic probe would, according to Michaud, be only used for purposes such as a one-way migration. Freitas points out that probes, unlike the interstellar radio waves commonly targeted by SETI searches, could store information for long, perhaps geological, timescales, and could emit strong radio signals unambiguously recognizable as being of intelligent origin, rather than being dismissed as a UFO or a natural phenomenon. Probes could also modify any signal they send to suit the system they were in, which would be impossible for a radio transmission originating from outside the target star system. Moreover, the use of small robotic probes with widely distributed beacons in individual systems, rather than a small number of powerful, centralized beacons, would provide a security advantage to the civilization using them. Rather than revealing the location of a radio beacon powerful enough to signal the whole galaxy and risk such a powerful device being compromised, decentralized beacons installed on robotic probes need not reveal any information that an extraterrestrial civilization prefers others not to have. Given the age of the Milky Way galaxy, an ancient extraterrestrial civilization may have existed and sent probes to the Solar System millions or even billions of years before the evolution of Homo sapiens. Thus, a probe sent may have been nonfunctional for millions of years before humans learn of its existence. Such a \\"dead\\" probe would not pose an imminent threat to humanity, but would prove that interstellar flight is possible. However, if an active probe were to be discovered, humans would react much more strongly than they would to the discovery of a probe that has long since ceased to function. ==Further implications of contact== Theological The confirmation of extraterrestrial intelligence could have a profound impact on religious doctrines, potentially causing theologians to reinterpret scriptures to accommodate the new discoveries. However, a survey of people with many different religious beliefs indicated that their faith would not be affected by the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence, and another study, conducted by Ted Peters of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, shows that most people would not consider their religious beliefs superseded by it. Surveys of religious leaders indicate that only a small percentage are concerned that the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence might fundamentally contradict the views of the adherents of their religion. Gabriel Funes, the chief astronomer of the Vatican Observatory and a papal adviser on science, has stated that the Catholic Church would be likely to welcome extraterrestrial visitors warmly. Contact with extraterrestrial intelligence would not be completely inconsequential for religion. The Peters study showed that most non-religious people, and a significant minority of religious people, believe that the world could face a religious crisis, even if their own beliefs were unaffected. Contact with extraterrestrial intelligence would be most likely to cause a problem for western religions, in particular traditionalist Christianity, because of the geocentric nature of western faiths. The discovery of extraterrestrial life would not contradict basic conceptions of God, however, and seeing that science has challenged established dogma in the past, for example with the theory of evolution, it is likely that existing religions will adapt similarly to the new circumstances. Douglas Vakoch argues that it is not likely that the discovery of extraterrestrial life will impact religious beliefs. In the view of Musso, a global religious crisis would be unlikely even for Abrahamic faiths, as the studies of himself and others on Christianity, the most \\"anthropocentric\\" religion, see no conflict between that religion and the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence. In addition, the cultural and religious values of extraterrestrial species would likely be shared over centuries if contact is to occur by radio, meaning that rather than causing a huge shock to humanity, such information would be viewed much as archaeologists and historians view ancient artifacts and texts. Funes speculates that a decipherable message from extraterrestrial intelligence could initiate an interstellar exchange of knowledge in various disciplines, including whatever religions an extraterrestrial civilization may host. Billingham further suggests that an extremely advanced and friendly extraterrestrial civilization might put an end to present-day religious conflicts and lead to greater religious toleration worldwide. On the other hand, Jill Tarter puts forward the view that contact with extraterrestrial intelligence might eliminate religion as we know it and introduce humanity to an all-encompassing faith. Vakoch doubts that humans would be inclined to adopt extraterrestrial religions, telling ABC News \\"I think religion meets very human needs, and unless extraterrestrials can provide a replacement for it, I don't think religion is going to go away,\\" and adding, \\"if there are incredibly advanced civilizations with a belief in God, I don't think Richard Dawkins will start believing.\\" Political Tim Folger speculates that news of radio contact with an extraterrestrial civilization would prove impossible to suppress and would travel rapidly, though Cold War scientific literature on the subject contradicts this. Media coverage of the discovery would probably die down quickly, though, as scientists began to decipher the message and learn its true impact. Different branches of government (for example legislative, executive, and judiciary) may pursue their own policies, potentially giving rise to power struggles. Even in the event of a single contact with no follow- up, radio contact may prompt fierce disagreements as to which bodies have the authority to represent humanity as a whole. Michaud hypothesizes that the fear arising from direct contact may cause nation-states to put aside their conflicts and work together for the common defense of humanity. Apart from the question of who would represent the Earth as a whole, contact could create other international problems, such as the degree of involvement of governments foreign to the one whose radio astronomers received the signal. The United Nations discussed various issues of foreign relations immediately before the launch of the Voyager probes, which in 2012 left the Solar System carrying a golden record in case they are found by extraterrestrial intelligence. Among the issues discussed were what messages would best represent humanity, what format they should take, how to convey the cultural history of the Earth, and what international groups should be formed to study extraterrestrial intelligence in greater detail. According to Luca Codignola of the University of Genoa, contact with a powerful extraterrestrial civilization is comparable to occasions where one powerful civilization destroyed another, such as the arrival of Christopher Columbus and Hern√°n Cort√©s into the Americas and the subsequent destruction of the indigenous civilizations and their ways of life. However, the applicability of such a model to contact with extraterrestrial civilizations, and that specific interpretation of the arrival of the European colonists to the Americas, have been disputed. Even so, any large difference between the power of an extraterrestrial civilization and our own could be demoralizing and potentially cause or accelerate the collapse of human society. Being discovered by a \\"superior\\" extraterrestrial civilization, and continued contact with it, might have psychological effects that could destroy a civilization, as is claimed to have happened in the past on Earth. Even in the absence of close contact between humanity and extraterrestrials, high- information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the potential to cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher. Legal Contact with extraterrestrial civilizations would raise legal questions, such as the rights of the extraterrestrial beings. An extraterrestrial arriving on Earth might only have the protection of animal cruelty statutes. Much as various classes of human being, such as women, children, and indigenous people, were initially denied human rights, so might extraterrestrial beings, who could therefore be legally owned and killed. If such a species were not to be treated as a legal animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence. Freitas considers that even if an extraterrestrial being were to be afforded legal personhood, problems of nationality and immigration would arise. An extraterrestrial being would not have a legally recognized earthly citizenship, and drastic legal measures might be required in order to account for the technically illegal immigration of extraterrestrial individuals. If contact were to take place through electromagnetic signals, these issues would not arise. Rather, issues relating to patent and copyright law regarding who, if anyone, has rights to the information from the extraterrestrial civilization would be the primary legal problem. Scientific and technological The scientific and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact through electromagnetic waves would probably be quite small, especially at first. However, if the message contains a large amount of information, deciphering it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the formation of the Solar System, which may greatly advance our technology and science. A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists as they come to know that what they are researching may already be known to another civilization. On the other hand, extraterrestrial civilizations with malicious intent could send information that could enable human civilization to destroy itself, such as powerful computer viruses or information on how to make extremely potent weapons that humans would not yet be able to use responsibly. While the motives for such an action are unknown, it would require minimal energy use on the part of the extraterrestrials. According to Musso, however, computer viruses in particular will be nearly impossible unless extraterrestrials possess detailed knowledge of human computer architectures, which would only happen if a human message sent to the stars were protected with little thought to security. Even a virtual machine on which extraterrestrials could run computer programs could be designed specifically for the purpose, bearing little relation to computer systems commonly used on Earth. In addition, humans could send messages to extraterrestrials detailing that they do not want access to the Encyclop√¶dia Galactica until they have reached a suitable level of technological advancement, thus mitigating harmful impacts of extraterrestrial technology. Extraterrestrial technology could have profound impacts on the nature of human culture and civilization. Just as television provided a new outlet for a wide variety of political, religious, and social groups, and as the printing press made the Bible available to the common people of Europe, allowing them to interpret it for themselves, so an extraterrestrial technology might change humanity in ways not immediately apparent. Harrison speculates that a knowledge of extraterrestrial technologies could increase the gap between scientific and cultural progress, leading to societal shock and an inability to compensate for negative effects of technology. He gives the example of improvements in agricultural technology during the Industrial Revolution, which displaced thousands of farm laborers until society could retrain them for jobs suited to the new social order. Contact with an extraterrestrial civilization far more advanced than humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, or anything previously experienced by humanity. Michaud suggests that humanity could be impacted by an influx of extraterrestrial science and technology in the same way that medieval European scholars were impacted by the knowledge of Arab scientists. Humanity might at first revere the knowledge as having the potential to advance the human species, and might even feel inferior to the extraterrestrial species, but would gradually grow in arrogance as it gained more and more intimate knowledge of the science, technology, and other cultural developments of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization. The discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence would have various impacts on biology and astrobiology. The discovery of extraterrestrial life in any form, intelligent or non- intelligent, would give humanity greater insight into the nature of life on Earth and would improve the conception of how the tree of life is organized. Human biologists could learn about extraterrestrial biochemistry and observe how it differs from that found on Earth. This knowledge could help human civilization to learn which aspects of life are common throughout the universe and which are specific to Earth. Ecological and biological-warfare impacts An extraterrestrial civilization might bring to Earth pathogens or invasive life forms that do not harm its own biosphere. Alien pathogens could decimate the human population, which would have no immunity to them, or they might use terrestrial livestock or plants as hosts, causing indirect harm to humans. Invasive organisms brought by extraterrestrial civilizations could cause great ecological harm because of the terrestrial biosphere's lack of defenses against them. On the other hand, pathogens and invasive species of extraterrestrial origin might differ enough from terrestrial organisms in their biology to have no adverse effects. Furthermore, pathogens and parasites on Earth are generally suited to only a small and exclusive set of environments, to which extraterrestrial pathogens would have had no opportunity to adapt. If an extraterrestrial civilization bearing malice towards humanity gained sufficient knowledge of terrestrial biology and weaknesses in the immune systems of terrestrial biota, it might be able to create extremely potent biological weapons. Even a civilization without malicious intent could inadvertently cause harm to humanity by not taking account of all the risks of their actions. According to Baum, even if an extraterrestrial civilization were to communicate using electromagnetic signals alone, it could send humanity information with which humans themselves could create lethal biological weapons. ==ReferencesNotes Further reading == * * * ==External links== * SETI Institute * Cultural Aspects of SETI * Introduction to ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence Category:Search for extraterrestrial intelligence Category:Extraterrestrial life Category:Cultural anthropology Category:Religion and science Category:Global culture Extraterrestrial Contact ","title":"Potential cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact"},{"id":"35233713","text":"K.A.B.O.S.H.

(Many of his ethnographic photographs are visible in the University of Wisconsin's Digital Library). His work in Ethiopia was concerned above all with political leadership and community organization as well as ethnohistory and culture history. The book, originally titled A Galla Monarchy: Jimma Abba Jifar, Ethiopia, 1830-1932, is a study of the nature of the monarchy, the sources of the ruler's power, as well as its origins. The study in 1965-66 centered on community life and the leadership of spirit mediums, k'allu, who effectively organized religious life and conflict resolution, and provided a degree of political leadership for rural districts. In the 1970s and 1980s, Lewis studied ethnicity, class, and culture change in Israel, focusing on those Jews who immigrated from Yemen and Morocco. The major publication resulting from this work was After the Eagles Landed: The Yemenites of Israel. Contrary to the stereotype of the Yemenites as downtrodden and rather poor \\"Oriental\\" Jews (mizrachim in current usage) Lewis's evidence showed them to be confident, increasingly successful in status (occupation, education, political presence), as well as maintaining and developing aspects of their music, dance, arts, and persistent in the orthodox Jewish religious belief and practices they brought with them from Yemen. His 2005 publication, Oneida Lives (see below), presents a large selection of personal accounts by Oneidas of Wisconsin that offer wide-ranging perspectives on the lives of men and women of various ages between 1885 and the beginning of World War II. (These accounts were collected by the Oneidas themselves through a WPA grant to the University of Wisconsin anthropology department. Morris Swadesh initiated the WPA project in 1937 and it was initially overseen by Floyd Lounsbury.) His book In Defense of Anthropology: An Investigation of the Critique of Anthropology presents a series of chapters that make a sustained argument for the value and honor of modern American and British anthropology. The work traces the major transformation undergone by American anthropology as a result of the cataclysmic events of the 1960s‚Äîthe war in Vietnam, the civil rights movement, the increasing rise of the women's and other identity movements, and the increasingly visible anti-colonial movements. The discipline of anthropology became the object of numerous critiques; \\"the critique of anthropology's complicity in projects of power is itself the main political act\\" (Sherry Ortner 1999). This work responds critically to these critiques, offering evidence to counter the widespread notion of anthropology as the handmaiden of colonialism, and of its liability for exoticizing and otherwise misrepresenting what post-1960s writers call \\"the Other.\\" A contextualized view of some of these critiques is also offered by Adam Kuper, in his book Anthropology and Anthropologists. Lewis' major research interests include: anthropological theory and history, cultural and social change, ethnicity, and political anthropology. Although initiated into anthropology by Marxian, materialist, neo-evolutionists at Brandeis and Columbia he soon became more of a Weberian-Boasian. His conversion was mediated and facilitated by fieldwork in political anthropology in Africa, a concern for ethnicity before this was a common and acceptable subject, the teaching of Conrad Arensberg, the early writings of Fredrik Barth, Max Weber on forms of political action. These led to a concern with individual action in the context of culture. == Significant works == Books *A Galla Monarchy:¬¨ Jimma Abba Jifar, Ethiopia, 1830-1932.¬¨ University of Wisconsin Press, 1965.

The center provides clinical, motivational and educational services for people with diabetes. It is part of HealthPartners Institute. IDC has conducted more than 350 clinical research studies since 1979, involving medications, medical devices and new diabetes technologies. The center has also been involved in several large National Institutes of Health (NIH) studies including Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC), Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) and Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness (GRADE). IDC provides professional education programs for diabetes educators, dietitians, physicians, nurses and other health care professionals in the United States. IDC has also trained health care professionals in 33 other countries. A partial list includes Russia, Mexico, Brazil, China, Japan, India, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Australia, Poland, France, Denmark and Norway. International Diabetes Center Publishing (IDC Publishing), established in 1997, translates IDC research into evidence-based diabetes education curricula, clinical tools, self-care booklets and food planners. IDC Publishing has more than 90 publications, including some in Spanish. ==History== International Diabetes Center was founded in 1967 by Donnell D. Etzwiler, MD, a pediatric endocrinologist. Originally called the Diabetes Education and Detection Center, it was located in Asbury Methodist Hospital in downtown Minneapolis. In 1982, to reflect growing involvement in international diabetes training, the center was renamed the International Diabetes Center. Three years later it was moved to its present location as part of the Park Nicollet Clinic‚ÄìSt. Louis Park campus.Hare, Jr., JR. (1996). Managing Change, Changing Medicine. Park Nicollet Press. . The center emphasized a team concept of diabetes management, which actively involved the doctor, nurse, dietitian and patient in managing the disease. The center practiced this concept with its patients and began to develop education programs and publications to share the team approach with other health professionals. Chronological highlights of research and events: *1976: Donnell D. Etzwiler, MD, serves as president of the American Diabetes Association. *1979: The center begins its first clinical research study on a purified animal insulin. *1983: Participation begins in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), funded by the National Institutes of Health. This long-term study shows that lowering blood glucose to near-normal levels reduces the risk of diabetes-related eye, kidney and nerve disease. *1985: The center is designated a World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center for Diabetes Education, Translation and Computer Technology. *1988: The center receives a grant from Becton Dickinson to develop a comprehensive, systematic approach for primary care providers. This leads to a textbook providing clinical guidelines for detecting and treating diabetes called Staged Diabetes Management.Mazze, RS, Strock, ES, Bergenstal, RM, Criego, A, Cuddihy, R, Langer, O, Simonson, GD, Powers, MA. (2012). Staged Diabetes Management, Third Edition. Wiley-Blackwell. . *1989: The first collaborative project in diabetes is initiated in Russia, with International Diabetes Center teams. More than 50 diabetes centers are established in Russia through this effort. *1989: The center trains health professionals from the U.S. Indian Health Service (IHS) on a reservation in Cass Lake, Minnesota. This relationship grows to include training at more than 67 IHS sites nationwide. *1994: The center is chosen for the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study. It remains an active site with EDIC study results showing that establishing an early level of control in blood glucose has long-lasting effects on the development of diabetes complications, even if that control is not maintained. The concept is labeled metabolic memory or ‚Äúimprinting.‚Äù *1995: Dietitians at IDC conduct a study to evaluate the effectiveness of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) in managing type 2 diabetes. The findings support that dietitian education alone improves glycemic control. This is a pivotal study that confirms the role of nutrition education and management in people with type 2 diabetes.Franz MJ, Splett PL, Monk A, Barry B, McLain K, Weaver T, Upham P, Bergenstal R, Mazze RS. (1995). Cost effectiveness of medical nutrition therapy provided by dietitians for persons with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Journal of the American Dietetic Association. 95:1018‚Äì1024. *1996: Donnell D. Etzwiler, MD, retires and endocrinologist Richard M. Bergenstal, MD, is named medical director. *2000: National Institutes of Health (NIH) selects IDC to participate in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial. ACCORD is one of the largest diabetes trials ever funded by NIH, and includes more than 70 sites across the United States and Canada. *2003: Working with General Mills, Inc., Richard M. Bergenstal, MD, and Diane Reader, RD, CDE, co-author Betty Crocker's Diabetes Cookbook.Bergenstal, RM, Reader, D, and Doran, M. (2003). Betty Crocker‚Äôs Diabetes Cookbook. Wiley Publishing, Inc. . *2008: IDC conducts the Hypertension and Diabetes Initiative, working with 12 U.S. health care organizations to improve blood pressure control in people with diabetes. The study finds that a collaborative that offers focus, structure and strategies to help health care organizations standardize and customize processes for blood pressure management can improve blood pressure control in people with diabetes. *2010: Richard M. Bergenstal, MD, serves as president, medicine and science, of the American Diabetes Association. *2011: The center participates in the T1D Exchange, developed by the Jaeb Center for Health Research and funded by a grant from the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust. The T1D Exchange is designed to better understand type 1 diabetes, improve care, and accelerate new therapies for the disease through collaborative research and data sharing. It combines traditional clinical research with the fields of health information and social networking. *2011: Under the auspices of the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center for Diabetes Education, Translation and Computer Technology, led by Roger S. Mazze, PhD, IDC worked jointly with Mayo Clinic to train physicians in China. With grant funding from Sanofi China, the joint team developed and delivered a program to prepare 500 Chinese physicians in advances in diabetes research, care and education. The program was active from 2011 to 2015. *2013: The center is a research site in the National Institutes of Health Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness (GRADE) Study.\\" The long-term study is comparing the long-term benefits and risks of four widely used diabetes drugs in combination with metformin, the most common first-line drug for treating type 2 diabetes. The study will compare drug effects on glucose levels, adverse effects, diabetes complications and quality of life over an average of nearly five years. *2016: Margaret (Maggie) Powers, PhD, RD, CDE, dietitian and research scientist at the center, serves as president, health care and education, of the American Diabetes Association. *2016: The center is one of 10 research sites globally to study the Medtronic 670G hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery system, sometimes referred to as an ‚Äúartificial pancreas.‚Äù Study results are published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves the device for use by type 1 diabetes patients in September 2016. *2017: IDC and Schneider Children's Medical Center in Israel together are awarded a grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (part of the National Institutes of Health) to continue their work in artificial pancreas research. They will compare the FDA-approved hybrid closed-loop system to a next-generation artificial pancreas system, programmed to further improve glucose control. ==References *Official website *International Diabetes Center Publishing Category:Diabetes organizations ","title":"International Diabetes Center at Park Nicollet"},{"id":"35233855","text":"Waimaj√£ (Waimaha), generically known as Bar√° or (Northern) Barasano, is a Tucanoan language of Colombia and Brazil.

It was named after Bad Godesberg, where Hitler had met Neville Chamberlain for long talks on 23 September continuing into the next day. ==Background== At the time of the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Sudetenland was a German-speaking part of the Empire which fell to the new state of Czechoslovakia, itself dominated by the Czechs. Initially, many Sudeten Germans wished to become part of the new German-speaking state of German Austria, and later they hoped to join Austria. However, the Treaty of Saint-Germain of 1919 confirmed the inclusion of the German-speaking territories within Czechoslovakia. By the beginning of 1938 most Sudetens aspired to be integrated into Nazi Germany, which was fast advancing in economic success and international prestige. Following an active propaganda campaign, Adolf Hitler began publicly to demand the \\"return\\" to Germany of a large part of the Sudetenland containing some three million German speakers.S. N. Sen, Contemporary World (New Age International, 2009, ), p. 61 In March 1938 France and the Soviet Union gave guarantees of military support to Czechoslovakia if Hitler began to use military force to seize the Sudetenland, but on 24 March Neville Chamberlain refused a French request to give the same pledge.Sen, pp. 61‚Äì62 In early September 1938, Chamberlain sent Lord Runciman to attempt to negotiate a settlement of the crisis between the Germans and the Czechs. On 7 September the Sudetens, led by Konrad Henlein, broke off the talks with Runciman, and on 12 September Hitler publicly advised the Sudetens to stand firm for union with Germany. On 15 September Chamberlain flew to Berchtesgaden to meet Hitler, who demanded self determination for the Sudetenland. Upon his return to London after his Berchtesgaden summit, Chamberlain told his Cabinet that Hitler's aims were \\"strictly limited\\" to the Sudetenland, and he felt it was quite possible to avoid war provided everyone played their part.Gerhard Weinberg, The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II, p. 438 He also had discussions with the French, in which he agreed with them a joint proposal to all parties for the gradual transfer to Germany of the areas which had a majority of Sudeten Germans.Sen, p. 62 Chamberlain returned to Germany, meeting Hitler on 22 and 23 September at Bad Godesberg to propose this solution. In presenting their peace plan for the transfer of the Sudetenland, the British delegation was most unpleasantly surprised to hear Hitler reject the terms he had himself presented at Berchtesgaden as now unacceptable.Keith Middlemas, Diplomacy of Illusion (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1972), p. 364 Hitler now demanded an immediate transfer, including occupation of the Sudetenland by German forces, and he quickly issued the \\"Godesberg Memorandum\\" to clarify his public position. ==Content== In his Memorandum Hitler proposed a plebiscite, without identifying the exact area for it, and provided for the plebiscite areas to be occupied by both German and Czech forces, pending the outcome of voting. German forces should enter the Sudetenland by 1 October.Terrance L. Lewis, Prisms of British Appeasement (2011), p. 150 Hitler demanded the Sudetenland be ceded to Germany no later than September 28, 1938 with no negotiations between Prague and Berlin and no international commission to oversee the transfer; no plebiscites to be held in the transferred districts until after the transfer; and he also declared that Germany would not abandon war as an option until all the claims against Czechoslovakia by Poland and Hungary had been satisfied. This was seen as a signal that Hitler had decided to put an end to Chamberlain‚Äôs peace-making efforts.Weinberg, p. 447 The arrangements for the transfer were to be decided bilaterally between the Germans and the Czechs and by no one else.Neville Chamberlain, In Search of Peace The \\"memorandum\\" stated an ultimatum for Czech acceptance of it, expiring at 2 pm on 28 September 1938. If the Czech government would not agree to Hitler's demands by then, Germany would take the Sudetenland by force.Life dated 26 April 1948, p. 74 Chamberlain protested about being presented with an ultimatum, to which Hitler replied that the document was entitled ‚ÄúMemorandum‚Äù, so could not be called an ultimatum.David Dilks, 'We Must Hope For The Best and Prepare For The Worse' from The Origins of The Second World War edited by Patrick Finney (London: Arnold, 1997), p. 44 ==Response and outcome== The Czechs announced on 28 September that they rejected the Memorandum, and the French ordered the mobilization of 600,000 men. The Royal Navy was also mobilized the same day. Although Hitler was angry at the rejection of his memorandum, he also feared a war against both Britain and France.Michael C. Thomsett, The German Opposition to Hitler: The Resistance, the Underground, ... (2007), p. 121: \\"Hitler was furious upon hearing that the British, French, and Czechs had all rejected his Godesberg memorandum. Hitler knew, however, that Germany's armed forces were no match for those of France and Britain.\\" He did not order an invasion on 28 September, having instead agreed to Chamberlain's proposal for a further meeting the next day, now at Munich, between four heads of government, Chamberlain for Britain, Hitler for Germany, Prime Minister Daladier for France and Mussolini for Italy, with no Czech or Soviet participation. On 1 October, a pact was signed which provided for possession of the Sudeten Province to be transferred to Germany, with Britain and France seeking to sweeten this bitter pill for the Czechs by guaranteeing the new borders of Czechoslovakia. There was also a separate agreement between the British and the Germans that stated that all future disputes between them would be the subject of negotiation. On 1 October, German troops marched into the Sudetenland, which was immediately incorporated into Germany. Some 115,000 Sudeten Czechs and 30,000 Sudeten Germans, including Social Democrats, Communists and Jews, fled to what was left of Czechoslovakia. By 1 March 1939, the number of refugees, as reported by the Institute for Refugee Assistance, stood at almost 150,000.Forced displacement of Czech population under Nazis in 1938 and 1943 at radio.cz, accessed 27 March 2012 ==Chronology== * 10 September 1938 ‚Äî In a speech at Nuremberg, Hermann G√∂ring calls the Czechs a \\"miserable pygmy race\\" who are \\"harassing the human race\\".

Hitler demands a German occupation of all German Sudeten territories by 1 October. That night, after a telephone conference, Chamberlain reverses his position and advises the Czechoslovaks to mobilize for war. * 23 September - At 22.30 The Czechoslovak Government orders general mobilization. By 30 September more than 1 million men were prepared to defend the country * 24 September ‚Äî At 1.30 am Hitler and Chamberlain conclude their talks and Chamberlain agrees to take Hitler's demands, codified in the Godesberg Memorandum, to the Czechoslovak Government himself. * 25 September ‚Äî The Czechs, the British cabinet, and the French government, reject the demands in the Memorandum and the French order a partial mobilization of their army. * 26 September ‚Äî In a speech in Berlin, Hitler hints that war with Czechoslovakia will begin at any moment. * 28 September ‚Äî As his deadline of 1 October for a German occupation of the Sudetenland approaches, Hitler invites Chamberlain, Benito Mussolini of Italy, and Edouard Daladier of France, to a final conference in Munich. The Czechs are not invited.

Nascimento was shot twice in the backyard of his home on May 3, 2011, which is World Press Freedom Day. The motive is unknown, but is believed to have been politically driven. ==Personal== Val√©rio Nascimento was 48 years old when he was murdered on May 3, 2011.http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=1588960 ==Career== Nascimento owned the newspaper Panorama Geral and was also an editor and journalist for the paper. Panorama Geral had only published four issues before he was killed. The latest edition published articles about alleged irregularities in the mayors office. The paper also attacked the city of Bananal's public services and about how the mayor had failed to invest in public parks and health and sewage treatment centers.http://www.ifex.org/brazil/2011/07/12/filgueira_arrests/ Politics Nascimento was also in charge of a local residents‚Äô association, had been a candidate for municipal councilor in both Rio Claro and the neighbouring municipality of Angra dos Reis, and had run twice for alderman. ==Death== Nascimento was shot dead outside of his home in Rio Claro on Tuesday May 3, 2011. The gunman had shot Nascimento once in the head and once in the back. Since the Panorama Geral had recently published articles about the city of Bananal and with Nascimento's work in politics, many people and authorities believed there was a motive behind the killing. Carlos Matos, who was the officer in charge of the investigation, believed Nascimento's murder was motivated politically.http://archives.newswatch.in/newsblog/9505 On May 4, the Committee to Protect Journalists insisted that local authorities coordinate a rigorous investigation of his murder to see if it was work related. There has been no proof of any motive so far. ==Context== Violence against journalists was on the rise in Brazil in 2011, with two other Brazilian journalists killed and a blogger shot and wounded. In April, less than a month before Nascimento was murdered, Luciano Leit√£o Pedrosa, a radio and television journalist known for his critical coverage of local authorities and criminal groups, was shot in Pernambuco state. Ricardo Gama, a critical political blogger, was seriously wounded in March when he was shot in the head, neck, and chest as he walked in his Rio de Janeiro neighborhood. CPJ's Impunity Index shows that five journalists' murders have remained unsolved over the past 10 years. Brazil returned to the index after dropping off a year ago. While Brazilian authorities have had success in prosecuting journalists' murders, winning several convictions in recent years, the country still sees persistent anti-press violence. By the end of the year, the International News Safety Institute (INSI) and the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism, known as Abraji, established an organization to train journalists on security and safety. ==Reactions== \\"Brazilian authorities must thoroughly investigate Val√©rio Nascimento's murder, determine if it was work-related, and bring those responsible to justice,\\" said Carlos Laur√≠a, CPJ's senior coordinator for the Americas. \\"We are alarmed by a series of violent attacks this year targeting journalists who report on official corruption.\\" ‚ÄúNascimento‚Äôs murder, which took place on World Press Freedom Day, is a reminder that Brazil is still a dangerous country for journalists despite recent legislative progress and efforts to combat impunity,‚Äù Reporters Without Borders said. ‚ÄúHe is the second journalist to have been gunned down this year while a third journalist, a blogger, only just survived a murder attempt.‚Äù \\"What makes these murders even that much more tragic is that while press freedom advocates around the world united to recognise World Press Freedom Day, these hard-working journalists were being gunned down in their homelands,\\" said IPI. ‚ÄúVal√©rio Nascinento was a journalist, newspaper owner and a politician, and his killing marks a clear attack on the right of citizens to engage in debate and political action; two essential and inter- related rights in any free democracy‚Äù the Director-General said. ‚ÄòI condemn his murder and I trust the authorities of Brazil will not let this crime - that took place as we were celebrating World Press Freedom Day - go unpunished.‚Äù The press freedom organization added: ‚ÄúWe pay tribute to Val√©rio Nascimento and we urge those investigating the case to carefully examine the possibility that he was killed in connection with his work as a journalist.

This poll is compiled by sportswriters across the nation. In Division I men's and women's college basketball, the AP Poll is largely just a tool to compare schools throughout the season and spark debate, as it has no bearing on postseason play. Generally, all top 25 teams in the poll are invited to the NCAA basketball tournament, also known as March Madness. ==ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll== The Coaches Poll is the second oldest poll still in use after the AP Poll. It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked #1; second highest is ranked #2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. Any team receiving votes after the top 25 are listed after the top 25 by their point totals. However, these are not real rankings: They are not considered #26, #27, etc. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775.

It is a popular recreation area, notable for its old-growth forest and its association with many literary figures from Concord‚Äôs past. ==History== The area is mentioned in the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and their contemporaries. The name ‚ÄòFairyland‚Äô probably dates to the 1850s and is attributed to Emerson‚Äôs children and their companions, including Louisa May Alcott, who lived nearby and often played there.W. Barksdale Maynard (2004): Walden Pond: a history (Oxford University Press) The Fairyland Pond as it appears today is artificial, having been created in the late 19th century when a dam was constructed. The dam‚Äôs drainage culvert was rebuilt in 2011. The inflow to the pond originates about 500 feet to the south at Brister‚Äôs Spring, named for Brister Freeman (mistakenly identified by Henry David Thoreau as ‚ÄòScipio‚Äô or ‚ÄòSippio‚Äô Brister),Walden: A Fully-Annotated Edition. Jeffrey S. Cramer, ed. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) p. 249 a freed slave who lived with his family on the small hill from which the spring emerges.Thoreau, Henry (1854): Walden The location of Brister‚Äôs house is now marked as part of the Drinking Gourd Project, which commemorates Concord‚Äôs role in the abolitionist movement. The site was considered significant by Emerson, who would sometimes bring visitors to drink a glass of water from the spring. Brister's Spring near Fairyland Pond ==Geography== Like the nearby Walden Pond (about half a mile to the south), Fairyland lies within a kettle hole, a depression formed by a retreating glacier. The artificial pond itself covers an area of 2.75 acres. Unlike Walden Pond (which is the deepest lake in Massachusetts), the Fairyland Pond is relatively shallow, with a maximum depth of 4 feet. Its 60-acre watershed is largely undeveloped, lying mostly within the Hapgood Wright conservation area. A certified vernal pool lies immediately to the west of the pond. The surrounding forest is primarily mixed hardwood, hemlock, pine and maple, and the area provides habitat for a diverse range of wildlife. ==Conservation== The Fairyland Pond and its surroundings were owned and protected for many years by Emerson‚Äôs daughter Edith Emerson Forbes. In 1935 the land was purchased by the town of Concord as the centerpiece of the Hapgood Wright Town Forest, a conservation area which now covers 183 acres. In the 1970s and 1980s the area was threatened by plans for large-scale development, including a proposed cloverleaf interchange between MA Rte 2 and Rte 126 (Walden Street), which would have obliterated Brister‚Äôs Spring and destroyed the area‚Äôs natural character. In 1984 part of Brister‚Äôs Hill was acquired by the prominent real-estate developer Mort Zuckerman, who intended to create a large office park on the site. These plans provoked strong opposition, given the perceived cultural significance of ‚ÄòThoreau country‚Äô in the origin of the environmental movement, and were ultimately defeated through the efforts of local conservation advocates, along with the musician Don Henley (lead singer of The Eagles), who donated funds and mobilized political and celebrity support (including a visit by President Clinton ) to acquire and preserve the threatened site as part of the Walden Woods Project. Hapgood Wright monument at Fairyland Pond ==Access== The Fairyland Pond lies on the Bay Circuit Trail, and is accessible by foot from the small parking lot on Walden Street opposite the entrance to the Concord-Carlisle High School. There is also a handicapped parking lot close to the Brister house site. ==References *Concordma.gov *Map of Bay Circuit Trail, Concord section Category:Henry David Thoreau Category:Ralph Waldo Emerson Category:Lakes of Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:Bay Circuit Trail Category:Tourist attractions in Concord, Massachusetts Category:Ponds of Massachusetts ","title":"Fairyland Pond"},{"id":"35234645","text":"Goldar () is a village in Zahray-ye Bala Rural District, in the Central District of Buin Zahra County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

In addition to Khaled and the track's featured artists, the video features cameos from rappers Drake, Birdman, Busta Rhymes and Mack Maine, among others. The video takes place at The BART. Brown appears in a cage as he sings the chorus. Rick Ross performs his verse on the sidelines of the train tracks as during the verse, Drake appears. Then Minaj raps her verse sitting on the train tracks as gasoline barrels on fire behind her. Then Wayne performs on the back of a destroyed train as Busta Rhymes, Mack Maine and Birdman make small appearances during Wayne's verse. ==Remix== The remix features Chris Brown, Fat Joe, Ace Hood, Jae Millz, Maino, Lil Twist, T-Streets, Bun B and Lil Chuckee. ==Live performances== Minaj and Wayne performed the song during Minaj's Pepsi Promotional Show as a part of her Pink Friday Tour.

According to Ross, this boundary value problem is a Pontryagin lift and is represented as Problem B^\\\\lambda. Illustration of the Covector Mapping Principle (adapted from Ross and Fahroo.I. M. Ross and F. Fahroo, A Perspective on Methods for Trajectory Optimization, Proceedings of the AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Conference, Monterey, CA, August 2002. Invited Paper No. AIAA 2002-4727. Now suppose one discretizes Problem B^\\\\lambda. This generates ProblemB^{\\\\lambda N} where N represents the number of discrete points. For convergence, it is necessary to prove that as : N \\\\to \\\\infty, \\\\quad \\\\text{Problem } B^{\\\\lambda N} \\\\to \\\\text{Problem } B^\\\\lambda In the 1960s Kalman and othersBryson, A.E. and Ho, Y.C. Applied optimal control. Hemisphere, Washington, DC, 1969. showed that solving Problem B^{\\\\lambda N} is extremely difficult. This difficulty, known as the curse of complexity,Ross, I. M. A Primer on Pontryagin's Principle in Optimal Control. Collegiate Publishers. Carmel, CA, 2009. . is complementary to the curse of dimensionality. In a series of papers starting in the late 1990s, Ross and Fahroo showed that one could arrive at a solution to Problem B^{\\\\lambda} (and hence Problem B ) more easily by discretizing first (Problem B^{N}) and dualizing afterwards (Problem B^{N \\\\lambda}). The sequence of operations must be done carefully to ensure consistency and convergence. The covector mapping principle asserts that a covector mapping theorem can be discovered to map the solutions of Problem B^{N \\\\lambda} to Problem B^{\\\\lambda N} thus completing the circuit. ==See also== *Legendre pseudospectral method *Ross‚ÄìFahroo pseudospectral methods *Ross‚ÄìFahroo lemma ==References== Category:Optimal control ","title":"Covector mapping principle"},{"id":"35234813","text":"Nasimabad () may refer to: *Nasimabad, Fars *Nasimabad, Isfahan *Nasimabad-e Bala, Isfahan Province *Nasimabad, Qazvin *Nasimabad, Razavi Khorasan ","title":"Nasimabad"},{"id":"35234816","text":"The U Sports Goaltender of the Year is the annual award presented to the U Sports men's ice hockey player who is judged by a committee of the U Sports Men‚Äôs Hockey Coaches Association to be the most outstanding goaltender in U Sports. ==Winners== *2016-17: Jordon Cooke (University of Saskatchewan) *2015-16: Jordon Cooke (University of Saskatchewan) *2014-15: Anthony Peters (Saint Mary's University) *2013-14: Jacob DeSerres (University of Calgary) *2012-13: Kurtis Mucha (University of Alberta) *2011-12: Real Cyr (University of Alberta) *2010-11: Dustin Butler (University of Calgary) *2009-10: Steve Christie (University of Manitoba) ==References== Category:U Sports ice hockey trophies and awards ","title":"U Sports Goaltender of the Year"},{"id":"35234820","text":"Nurabad (, also Romanized as N≈´rƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Zahray-ye Bala Rural District, in the Central District of Buin Zahra County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

It took on the role of the Health Protection Agency, the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse and a number of other health bodies. It is an executive agency of the Department of Health and Social Care, and a distinct delivery organisation with operational autonomy.Agreement between the Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England: February 2018 On 18 August 2020, it was announced that Public Health England was to be replaced by the National Institute for Health Protection, a new agency created to deal with the threat of infectious diseases by combining PHE with the NHS Test and Trace operation. == Establishment == Proposals for reorganising the National Health Service were published in the early months of the Cameron‚ÄìClegg coalition, in a July 2010 white paper from the Department of Health (under Andrew Lansley) titled \\"Equity and excellence: Liberating the NHS\\". This was followed by a more detailed paper \\"Healthy Lives, Healthy People: Our strategy for public health in England\\" in November. The bill to implement the proposals was introduced to the House of Commons in January 2011, and was the subject of a report by the Health Select Committee in October. Responding to criticism, the government published \\"Healthy Lives, Healthy People: Update and way forward\\" in July. The Health and Social Care Act gained royal assent in March 2012, with all elements of the new system to be operative by April 2013. The Act established Public Health England as an executive body accountable to the Secretary of State for Health. It took over public health activity from the department and from the regional strategic health authorities (which were abolished), and all activities of the Health Protection Agency, the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse, the Public Health Observatories, the cancer registries, the National Cancer Intelligence Network, and the UK National Screening Committee together with its screening programmes. ==Mission, funding and resources== Each year (most recently in late April 2020) the Department of Health and Social Care sets out PHE's remit and priorities in a letter to the chief executive. PHE's mission is \\"to protect and improve the nation‚Äôs health and to address inequalities\\". It employs approximately 5,000 staff (full-time equivalent), who are mostly scientists, researchers and public health professionals. It announced plans to move its headquarters and 2,750 staff to Harlow on a former GlaxoSmithKline site in 2017. PHE laboratories provide an extensive range of microbiological diagnostic tests. The Secretary of State sets the total budget for public health, and determines how it is allocated between PHE and local authorities.  Relationship with local authorities  The 2012 Act, which established PHE as a national body, also returned to local authorities the responsibility for a range of community and public health services. Each upper tier local authority is required to appoint a director of public health, an officer of the authority who is responsible for the authority's public health functions including responding to emergencies. there are 134 of these posts. == 2020 reorganisation == A reorganisation of public health protection in England was announced by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, on 18 August 2020. PHE would be combined with NHS Test and Trace to form the National Institute for Health Protection, under a new leadership structure headed by Conservative peer Dido Harding as interim CEO. Michael Brodie was appointed as interim PHE CEO, replacing Duncan Selbie. The new NIHP would focus on infectious disease control, particularly the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Options for PHE's other roles, such as preventing ill health and reducing health inequalities, were to be discussed. ==Structure== PHE has the following public-facing divisions: *Health protection: **Chemical, radioactive, and environmental hazards ***Research ***National Poisons Information Service ***Services for those working with hazardous materials ***Harm reduction in relation to polluted environments ***Operations **Field epidemiology, including contact tracing **Contagious disease surveillance and control **Major incident response *Health improvement: **Substance misuse treatment programmes **Health promotion (such as healthy diet or anti-smoking marketing) **Health screening programmes (such as cancer screening, STD checks, cardiovascular disease screening, etc.) ‚Äì supervised by the UK National Screening Committee **Reducing health inequalities **Specialist healthcare commissioning (in relation to major incidents, etc.) **National Cancer Intelligence Network (and other networks) *Knowledge and information **Substance misuse treatment monitoring **Disease registration **Research and development *Operations: **Microbiology unit ***Microbe production ***Research ***References ***Specialist services **Regional units (South / Midlands / North / London) ***Preparation and response against major incidents ***Local centres (several centres per regional unit, except London) ****Local health protection ****Substance misuse treatment services (over more than one centre) ****Local specialist commissioning (in relation to major incidents, etc.) and advice == Key people == Duncan Selbie was the chief executive of PHE from its formation until 2020; he was previously chief executive of Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust. In the reorganisation announced in August 2020, Michael Brodie was appointed as interim CEO. Brodie was finance director at PHE from its formation until 2019, when he became CEO of the NHS Business Services Authority. Other senior personnel include: * Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director and Director of Health Protection from 2019, replacing Paul Cosford who became Emeritus Medical Director. * Kevin Fenton, Regional Director for London. * Jenny Harries was Regional Director for the South of England until her appointment as Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England in 2019. * Anne Mackie, Director of Screening Programmes * Professor John Newton, Director of Health Improvement. * Alison Tedstone, nutritionist, Director of Diet, Obesity and Physical Activity. ==Campaigns== PHE took over the responsibility for 'Be Clear on Cancer' campaigns after it was created in the Health and Social Care Act 2012. Campaigns have been run on lung cancer, bowel cancer, oesophago- gastric and kidney & bladder cancer. PHE is also responsible for Change4Life and ACT FAST. In January 2014 it launched a campaign against smoking called 'Health Harms' on television and billboards across England. == COVID-19 == The bullet points setting out PHE's priorities for 2019/20 in the annual directive from the Department of Health and Social Care included coordination of the response to public health emergencies under a heading \\"Leaving the EU\\". In addition, an \\"integrated surveillance system\\" and \\"investigation and management of outbreaks of infectious diseases\\" were listed in an annex. PHE carried out contact tracing in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, but this ceased on 12 March 2020 in view of the wide spread of infection in the population. From 19 March, consistent with the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens, PHE no longer classified COVID-19 as a \\"high consequence infectious disease\\" (HCID). This reversed an interim recommendation made in January 2020, due to more information about the disease confirming low overall mortality rates, greater clinical awareness, and a specific and sensitive laboratory test, the availability of which continues to increase. The statement said \\"the need to have a national, coordinated response remains\\" and added \\"this is being met by the government‚Äôs COVID-19 response\\". This meant cases of COVID-19 were no longer managed by HCID treatment centres only.  Mortality data  PHE began publishing a weekly COVID-19 epidemiology surveillance summary each Thursday from 23 April, combining community, primary care, secondary care, virology and mortality surveillance data to support national and regional planning in relation to the pandemic.Public Health England, Weekly COVID-19 surveillance report published, first published 23 April 2020, updated 29 August 2020, accessed 4 September 2020 From 29 April, PHE collated daily reporting of the number of deaths of people in England with a positive COVID-19 test; the numbers published each day by the UK government had previously only counted deaths in hospital. By July, as the number of deaths continued to fall, PHE reported significantly more deaths than those collated weekly by the Office for National Statistics from death certificates. Concerns were raised ‚Äì by the Centre for Evidence- Based Medicine and others ‚Äì that PHE's figures were over-estimates, since they included anyone who had a positive COVID-19 test, no matter how long ago. On 12 August it was agreed to publish the numbers of deaths within 28 days of a positive test, as was already done by other UK administrations. The cumulative total was recalculated as 41,329, a 12% decrease. John Newton, a PHE director, wrote that the method established in April was designed to avoid undercounting, and that PHE always intended to review the approach as the pandemic progressed.  Handling of test results  On 2 October 2020, it was realised that almost 16,000 COVID-19 test results received by PHE from commercial laboratories since 25 September had not been loaded into dashboards or passed to the outsourced Test and Trace operation (notifications of test results to individuals were not affected). PHE retrieved the missing results after determining that the cause was ill-thought-out use of Microsoft's Excel software. Matt Hancock, Health Secretary, said in Parliament that the error \\"should never have happened\\". ==Criticism and other published comment== Public Health England has been criticised for downplaying mental health within its overall resourcing and agenda; in 2011 the Royal College of Psychiatrists, commenting on the plan to create PHE, stated its concern that there appeared to be \\"few, or no, commitments or resources within either the Department of Health or Public Health England to take the public mental health agenda forward\\". The agency was criticised by Professor Martin McKee in January 2014. He said that continuing health inequalities among London boroughs was a scandal, and claimed coalition reforms had left it unclear who was supposed to analyse health data and tackle the problems highlighted. The agency was criticised by The Lancet for allegedly using weak evidence in a review of electronic cigarettes to endorse an estimate that e-cigarette use is 95% less hazardous than smoking: \\"it is on this extraordinarily flimsy foundation that PHE based the major conclusion and message of its report\\" ... this \\"raises serious questions not only about the conclusions of the PHE report, but also about the quality of the agency's peer review process.\\" Authors of the PHE report subsequently published a document clarifying that their endorsement of the 95% claim did not stand on the single study criticised in The Lancet, but on their broad review of toxicological evidence. The agency has also been criticised for \\"serious questions about transparency and conflicts of interest\\" regarding this review, that PHE's response \\"did not even begin to address the various relationships and funding connections\\" in question, and that this \\"adds to questions about the credibility of the organisation‚Äôs advice\\". Scientific evidence accumulated since has cast further doubt on PHE's claim. A 2017 question in the House of Lords revealed that a position underpinning UK Government policy, namely \\"that well run and regulated modern municipal waste incinerators are not a significant risk to public health remains valid\\", was asserted in advance of the results having been obtained from a study commissioned by Public Health England to answer the question whether municipal waste incinerators did, in fact, constitute a significant risk to public health. ==See also== * Health in the United Kingdom * List of national public health agencies ==References * Category:2013 establishments in England Category:Government agencies established in 2013 Category:Health in the London Borough of Lambeth Category:Organisations based in the London Borough of Lambeth Category:National public health agencies ","title":"Public Health England"},{"id":"35234844","text":"Ceruminous adenocarcinoma is a malignant neoplasm derived from ceruminous glands of the external auditory canal. This tumor is rare, with several names used in the past. Synonyms have included cylindroma, ceruminoma, ceruminous adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified (NOS), ceruminous adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), and ceruminous mucoepidermoid carcinoma. == Classification == This tumor only affects the outer 1/3 to 1/2 of the external auditory canal as a primary site. If this area is not involved, the diagnosis should be questioned. The most common tumor type is ceruminous adenoid cystic carcinoma and ceruminous adenocarcinoma, NOS. == Signs and symptoms == Pain is the most common symptom, followed by either sensorineural or conductive hearing loss, tinnitus or drainage (discharge). A mass lesion may be present, but it is often slow growing. ==Diagnosis==  Imaging Imaging studies are used to define the extent of the tumor and to exclude direct extension from the parotid gland or nasopharynx. The imaging findings are usually non-specific, and cannot give a specific diagnosis.  Pathology Tumors are polypoid, identified most often in the posterior canal. It is not uncommon to have ulceration of the surface squamous epithelium. Most tumors are about 1.5 cm in greatest dimension, a limitation of the anatomic site rather than of the tumor type itself. The tumors are separated into three main histologic or microscopic types: * Ceruminous adenocarcinoma, NOS * Ceruminous adenoid cystic carcinoma * Ceruminous mucoepidermoid carcinoma All of the tumors are infiltrative into the soft tissue, benign ceruminous glands, and/or bone. The tumor may expand into the overlying squamous surface epithelium, but it usually does not arise from the surface epithelium. The tumors are cellular, arranged in solid, cystic, cribriform, glandular, and single cell patterns. It is uncommon to see tumor necrosis, but when it is present, it is diagnostic of cancer. The same is true of perineural invasion. Nuclear pleomorphism is usually easily to identify, with the nuclei containing prominent nucleoli. There are usually increased mitotic figures, including atypical forms. There are usually areas of stromal fibrosis. Ceroid (cerumen or ear wax) is not seen in malignancies, although it is seen in benign tumors. The specific features of each tumor type can help with the separation into adenoid cystic carcinoma or mucoepidermoid types.  Immunohistochemistry  Immunohistochemistry will help to show the biphasic appearance of the tumor, highlighting the basal or the luminal cells: * Luminal cells: positive with CK7 and CD117 * Basal cells: positive with p63, S100 protein and CK5/6  Differential diagnoses  It is important to exclude a tumor which is directly extending into the ear canal from the parotid salivary gland, especially when dealing with an adenoid cystic or mucoepidermoid carcinoma. This can be eliminated by clinical or imaging studies. Otherwise, the histologic differential diagnosis includes a ceruminous adenoma (a benign ceruminous gland tumor) or a neuroendocrine adenoma of the middle ear (middle ear adenoma). == Management == Wide, radical, complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice, with free surgical margins to achieve the best outcome and lowest chance of recurrence. Radiation is only used for palliation. In general, there is a good prognosis, although approximately 50% of patients die from disease within 3‚Äì10 years of presentation. == Epidemiology == This is a very rare neoplasm accounting for approximately 0.0003% of all tumors and about 2.5% of all external ear neoplasms. There is a wide age range at initial presentation, although the mean age is about 50 years of age. Females are affected slightly more often (1.5:1). == References  Further reading == * == External links == Category:Ear Category:Types of cancer ","title":"Ceruminous adenocarcinoma"},{"id":"35234845","text":"Papoli-ye Vosta (, also Romanized as PƒÅpolƒ´-ye Vos≈£√°, PƒÅ Polƒ´-ye Vasa≈£ƒ´, and PƒÅypol-e Vost√°; also known as PƒÅplu, PƒÅpolƒ´, Papoli Sofl√°, PƒÅpolƒ´-ye Mƒ´ƒÅnƒ´, and PƒÅp≈´lƒ´) is a village in Zahray-ye Bala Rural District, in the Central District of Buin Zahra County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

Subramaniam (1924-1968), also known as Maniam, was an illustrator for Tamil magazines, known for his reconstructions of the past in illustrations for popular historical fiction. ==Biography== Maniam learned to draw at a young age by watching his uncle Lingayyah sketch. He studied at a school in Mylapore, Chennai, and later at Chennai's art school, where K.C.S. Paniker and Devi Prasad Roy Choudhury were his teachers. While still a student, he was introduced to Kalki Krishnamurthy, the celebrated novelist and editor of Kalki magazine. Impressed by his work, Kalki urged the young artist to leave his studies and work with him. Maniam thus came to work with Kalki. For his guru and guide, he illustrated the serialized novels Sivagamiyin Sapatham set in the Pallava kingdom, and the classic Ponniyin Selvan depicting the Chola age. Maniam's illustrations for the latter classic employed a variety of techniques and mediums, from pen & ink to gouache and watercolour. Maniam's visualization of the Tamil classical past was much admired in his time, and his depictions of Bharatanatyam postures drew praise from noted classical dancers such as Padma Subrahmanyam. Maniam travelled widely with Kalki to study and sketch the art of Ajanta, Ellora, Hampi, Badami, Mamallapuram and Thanjavur. When Kalki's Parthiban Kanavu (1960) was filmed, Maniam was the obvious choice for art director. He also designed costumes for a few other films. Maniam died in 1968. His only son T.S.

Neelakantan, starring M. G. Ramachandran in the lead role and Jayalalithaa, M. N. Nambiar, S. A. Ashokan, Sivakumar and Nagesh among others. It was the first film released after the shooting in his neck took place in 1967 and there was a rumour that MGR had no scope to continue in films in view of his voice. It ran 164 days in Ceylon and over 100 days in Chennai and other major cities and became the top grosser of the year. Thus it proved MGR could continue in films as well and thus next year MGR acted in 8 films. Thereafter continuously, his films ran box office hits of the years, consecutively. The film was remade in Hindi as Rakhwala, starring Dharmendra and Leena Chandavarkar. ==Plot== Mani (alias Manikkam) (MGR), stemming from a modest background, enters in the service of the billionaire Maradhatchalam (M. N. Nambiar), as the driver. The charming daughter of this fantastically wealthy notable, Susila (Jayalalitha) desperately falls in love with Mani and it is mutual. However, Mani seems to be very worried. He does not confine himself only to his driver's job. Indeed, upset by the terrible secret (that her mother reveals him at the bedside of her agony) on his young brother Chandra (Sivakumar) and intrigued by the strange behavior and the actions of his boss, Maradhatchalam, Manikkam looks actively for the answers! In spite of the categorical opposition of his father and contrary to all expectations, Susheela marries the man of her life, Manikkam. But does she believe and do they think all to know or to seize Manikkam, really? But who is thus, in reality, this Mani? What does he plot? Another version Mani (alias Manikkam) (MGR) is employed as a driver with Maruthachalam (M. N. Nambiar). Mani and his employer daughter Susheela (Jayalalitha) fall in love with each other and get married against Maruthachalam wishes. This also enrages Nagu (S. A. Ashokan), her father's business partner, who intended to marry her. In order to make her marriage successful, Susheela disowns her father and his wealth. Mani, on the other hand, loses his mother after a prolonged illness. But before she dies, she tells him to safeguard the secret about his brother Chandra (Sivakumar) and is overhead by his uncle Vadhilingam (V. K. Ramasamy). He tries to blackmail Marudhachalam and make money with same. Meanwhile, Susila learns that her husband and father have been foes for long. Does Marudhachalam manage to keep the secret himself or does his enmity with Mani make him pay for his mistakes and greed? ==Cast== {  width=\\"72%\\" - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" ! Actor !! Role -  M. G.

He was a student of Carl Hindenburg and a member of Hindenberg's school of combinatorics... ==Biography== Rothe was born in 1773 in Dresden, and in 1793 became a docent at the University of Leipzig. He became an extraordinary professor at Leipzig in 1796, and in 1804 he moved to Erlangen as a full professor, taking over the chair formerly held by Karl Christian von Langsdorf. He died in 1842, and his position at Erlangen was in turn taken by Johann Wilhelm Pfaff, the brother of the more famous mathematician Johann Friedrich Pfaff... ==Research== The Rothe‚ÄìHagen identity, a summation formula for binomial coefficients, appeared in Rothe's 1793 thesis. It is named for him and for the later work of Johann Georg Hagen.. The same thesis also included a formula for computing the Taylor series of an inverse function from the Taylor series for the function itself, related to the Lagrange inversion theorem.. In the study of permutations, Rothe was the first to define the inverse of a permutation, in 1800. He developed a technique for visualizing permutations now known as a Rothe diagram, a square table that has a dot in each cell (i,j) for which the permutation maps position i to position j and a cross in each cell (i,j) for which there is a dot later in row i and another dot later in column j. Using Rothe diagrams, he showed that the number of inversions in a permutation is the same as in its inverse, for the inverse permutation has as its diagram the transpose of the original diagram, and the inversions of both permutations are marked by the crosses. Rothe used this fact to show that the determinant of a matrix is the same as the determinant of the transpose: if one expands a determinant as a polynomial, each term corresponds to a permutation, and the sign of the term is determined by the parity of its number of inversions. Since each term of the determinant of the transpose corresponds to a term of the original matrix with the inverse permutation and the same number of inversions, it has the same sign, and so the two determinants are also the same.. In his 1800 work on permutations, Rothe also was the first to consider permutations that are involutions; that is, they are their own inverse, or equivalently they have symmetric Rothe diagrams. He found the recurrence relation :T(n) = T(n-1) + (n-1)T(n-2) for counting these permutations, which also counts the number of Young tableaux, and which has as its solution the telephone numbers :1, 2, 4, 10, 26, 76, 232, 764, 2620, 9496, ... ., pp. 48 & 65. Rothe was also the first to formulate the q-binomial theorem, a q-analog of the binomial theorem, in an 1811 publication... ==Selected publications== * Formulae De Serierum Reversione Demonstratio Universalis Signis Localibus Combinatorio-Analyticorum Vicariis Exhibita: Dissertatio Academica, Leipzig, 1793. * \\"Ueber Permutationen, in Beziehung auf die Stellen ihrer Elemente.

Burton was one of the most prolific architects of chapels, meetinghouses, tabernacles and temples for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In 1910 he opened an architectural firm with Hyrum Pope (Pope and Burton) in Salt Lake City, Utah. They were particularly fond of Frank Lloyd Wright and the Prairie School architectural style. As young architects, Pope & Burton won design competitions for two of their better-known works, the Cardston Alberta and Laie Hawaii temples of the LDS Church. Burton moved to Los Angeles, California in 1927 to set up another office in the firm with Pope. After Pope unexpectedly died in 1939, Burton established a new firm with his son Douglas W. Burton. Together they continued to design many buildings, including some for the church. In 1955, Harold became the chief supervising architect for the LDS Church. One of his final works was the Oakland California Temple. Aside from places of worship, Burton also designed civic buildings and homes. Many of his works exist today, some of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==Notable Works== File:LDS Laie Hawaii Temple front view.jpgLaie Hawaii Temple (1919) File:Blackfoot Tabernacle 1.jpgBlackfoot Tabernacle (1921) *NRHP listed File:Cardston Alberta Canada Temple.jpgCardston Alberta Temple (1923) *NHSC listed File:Holy Trinity Cathedral.jpgHoly Trinity Cathedral (Salt Lake City, Utah) (1923) *NRHP listed File:Wilshire Ward Chapel.jpgWilshire Ward Chapel (1929) *LAHCM listed) File:Mormon Temple, Oakland.jpgOakland California Temple (1964) Other existing works *Malcolm and Elizabeth Keyser House (1913), NRHP-listed *Julia Budge Nibley House (1914) *Walter Scott Weiler House (1914) *St. Paul's Episcopal Church - Salt Lake City (1917) *Brooklyn Chapel Meetinghouse (1917) *Currently the Evening Star Baptist Church on Franklin and Gates *Denver First Ward Meetinghouse (1918) *Vernal Second Ward Chapel (1918) *Centerville Ward Chapel (1918) *Highland Park Ward Meetinghouse (1924) *NRHP listed in Highland Park Historic District (Salt Lake City, Utah) *Ezra Thompson Building (1924), also known as the former Salt Lake Tribune building, by Pope & Burton, NRHP-listed *Memorial House Facade (1926) Memory Grove (Salt Lake City) *Provo First Ward Meetinghouse (1928) *Phoenix Second Ward Meetinghouse, NRHP-listed in Roosevelt Historic District (Currently the Great Arizona Puppet Theater) *University Ward Chapel (1929), NRHP-listed in University Neighborhood Historic District (Salt Lake City, Utah) *Davis County Courthouse (1929) *LeConte Stewart House, 172 W. 100 South Kaysville, Utah, NRHP-listed *Honolulu Stake Tabernacle (1941) *East Bay Interstake Center (1950's) *McKay Foyer on Brigham Young University - Hawaii Campus (1957) *Las Vegas Ninth Ward Meetinghouse (1961) Demolished works *Emigration Ward Chapel (1910-) *Liberty Stake 1st Ward Meetinghouse (1911-1976) *Park Stake First Ward Meetinghouse (1913-1976) *Previously NRHP listed *Nephi First and Second Ward Chapel (1915) *Hyde Park Ward Chapel (1918) ==See also== *Harold W. and Evelyn Burton House, in Holladay, Utah, a mansion/home of Harold W.

The project also used $300 million in EB-5 visa financing from foreign nationals. ==Construction== Construction on the first phase began with a groundbreaking ceremony held on September 27, 2011. The first phase, built by JTM Contractors, is the western block's podium topped by two residential towers. The four-story base includes apartments, retail space, and a parking garage. The two towers on the western block are The Wave, a 26-story high-rise with 333 units, and The Nolo, a 10-story apartment building with more than 100 units. The Wave's structure consists of multistory glass-clad boxes indirectly stacked atop one another and was designed by Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Architects. Approval of the design by the Pioneer Square Preservation Board was required to ensure that the architecture was appropriate for the historical neighborhood. Local covenant required that key views from the stadium of the Space Needle and the historic clock tower of King Street Station were to be protected. Residents in the upper floors of the south tower are given a partial view of the play taking place within the neighboring stadium. Of the 500 apartments throughout the first phase's complex, only about 30 units will be set aside for low-income residents. The Nolo was completed and opened in September 2013, while The Wave was opened in 2014.

It lives chiefly in shady woodlands, and grows up to tall, producing a cluster of up to 18 pale blue flowers in spring. It was formally described in 1996, having previously been identified as belonging to the related species H. italica. ==Description== Hyacinthoides paivae is a perennial plant which grows from bulbs that are typically √ó . Each bulb produces 4‚Äì7 (more rarely 2‚Äì12) basal leaves, each long and wide. The stems are long, and bear an inflorescence comprising 6‚Äì18 flowers in a multilateral raceme. Each flower is attached by a pedicel long, and is itself long by wide. H. paivae can be told apart from H. italica by its broader leaves and larger flowers; H. hispanica differs in having longer, narrower, unscented and bell- shaped flowers. ==Distribution and ecology== Hyacinthoides paivae is endemic to the north-western part of the Iberian Peninsula, including western parts of Galicia (A Coru√±a, Ourense and Pontevedra provinces) and north-western parts of Portugal (Beira Litoral, Douro Litoral, Minho and Tr√°s-os-Montes provinces). Material of an unidentified species from the Sierra de la Demanda, a small mountain range on the border between Burgos province and La Rioja, matches H. paivae genetically. H.paivae was confused with this species, H. italica, seen growing at the Berne Botanical Gardens. H. paivae occurs in oak woodland and pine woods growing over Ulex, Erica cinerea and Cistus spp., as well as other shady habitats. It also occurs occasionally on coastal cliffs, and in mown meadows. The typical flowering period is March and April, although it can be as late as June in upland areas, such as Monte Pindo. ==Taxonomic history== In 1990, bluebells assigned to the species Hyacinthoides italica were reported from north-western Spain. Later analyses of the species morphology demonstrated that the plants did not belong to H. italica, which is only otherwise found near the French‚ÄìItalian border. Instead, it was realised that they represented a new species, which was named Hyacinthoides paivae by Santiago Ortiz and Juan Rodr√≠guez-Oubi√±a in 1996, the specific epithet ' honouring the Portuguese botanist Jorge Paiva. The holotype, a specimen from Dumbr√≠a, A Coru√±a province, Spain, is held at the herbarium of the '; isotypes are also kept there, and at the University of Coimbra, the ' and ' in Madrid, the ' in Pontevedra, and at the Natural History Museum and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London. Ortiz and Rodr√≠guez-Oubi√±a initially placed the species in \\"Hyacinthoides sect. Somera\\", but more recent molecular phylogenetic analysis could not confirm any of the existing sections in the genus, and placed it instead in an informal group alongside H. non-scripta, H. hispanica and H. cedretorum. ==Referencespaivae Category:Plants described in 1996 Category:Flora of Spain Category:Flora of Portugal ","title":"Hyacinthoides paivae"},{"id":"35235188","text":"Dizzy and Strings (also released as Diz Big Band) is an album by trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, released in 1955 by Norgran Records.Dizzy Gillespie discography accessed March 27, 2012 ==Track listing== All compositions by Dizzy Gillespie except as indicated # \\"Roses of Picardy\\" (Frederick Weatherly, Haydn Wood) - 4:38 # \\"Silhouette\\" (Johnny Richards) - 3:56 # \\"Can You Recall?\\" (Richards) - 3:27 # \\"O Solow\\" (Richards) - 5:06 # \\"Cool Eyes\\" - 3:48 # \\"Confusion\\" (Buster Harding) - 4:42 # \\"Pile Driver\\" - 3:54 # \\"Hob Nail Special\\" - 2:52 ==Personnel== *Dizzy Gillespie - trumpet, vocals Tracks 1-4 (with orchestra) *John Barrows, Jim Buffington, Jim Chambers, Fred Klein - French horn *George Berg, Jack Greenberg, Tom Parshley - woodwinds *Danny Bank - baritone saxophone *Wynton Kelly - piano *Percy Heath - bass *Jimmy Crawford - drums *Unidentified string section *Johnny Richards - arranger, conductor Tracks 5-8 (with big band) *Jimmy Nottingham, Ernie Royal, Quincy Jones - trumpet *J.

The film weaves in and out of three modes: 1) Stutz' experience with suicide in his family; 2) Candid interviews with suicide survivors and experts in fields such as mental health, religion, theater; and 3) Commissioning artists to create works for the film that tackle suicide in a unique way. == Synopsis == The movie begins with frank, humorous interviews of two men who set out to kill themselves and then moves into a Day Of The Dead celebration where the guests celebrate the lives of those whom they have lost. Director Stutz questions his family about his mother's suicide in 1979 and how little they've actually discussed it, visiting his mother's grave site with his sister and listening to old tapes of their mother. He talks to several survivors and experts before commissioning several artists to come up with works about suicide: A band (The Bigfellas) agrees to make a song about suicide \\"that you can dance to\\"; an illustrator (Patrick Horvath) is to make short animated films (which run through the documentary as interstitials); a choreographer (Danielle Peig) chooses to create a dance piece based on two autopsy reports; and a standup comedian (Duncan Trussell) compiles material for his act about suicide with the help of several top comedy writers. Meanwhile, Stutz continues to interview and engage his family about his mother's death, eventually staging his mother's suicide (where he discovered her unconscious at the age of 12) on screen with members of the \\"avant-garde circus\\" troupe, The Lucent Dossier Experience. As some of the interviews take a turn from the dark to the more cathartic, the tone of the movie brightens at the end during the performances of the artistic material. The interview subjects give positive, inspiring messages to the audience about things they can actively do to help prevent suicides and connect more deeply with those they love. The movie closes with images of another ceremony at the ocean which bookends the Day Of The Dead images from the beginning of the film. == Release == The film be officially released in Fall 2012 at a suicide arts festival in Los Angeles being produced by the makers of the film.

Their 1996 album Horse Stories was voted by Rolling Stone as one of the top three albums of the year. Two of their albums have peaked into the top 50 on the ARIA Albums Chart, Ocean Songs (1998) and Toward the Low Sun (2012). During their career they have spent much of their time overseas when not performing together. Turner is based in Melbourne, White lives in New York, and Ellis in Paris. Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane described them as providing a \\"rumbling, dynamic sound incorporated open-ended, improvisational, electric rock ... minus the jazz- rock histrionics\\". In October 2010, Ocean Songs was listed in the book 100 Best Australian Albums. ==History== Warren Ellis of the Dirty Three at WOMADELAIDE 2012 Mick Turner of the Dirty Three Dirty Three formed as an instrumental rock trio in Melbourne in 1992 with Warren Ellis on violin and bass guitar (ex-These Future Kings in 1986), Mick Turner on lead and bass guitars (Sick Things, The Moodists, Venom P. Stinger, Fungus Brains), and Jim White on drums (People with Chairs Up Their Noses, Feral Dinosaurs, Venom P. Stinger). Prior to the formation of Dirty Three, Ellis studied classical violin, worked briefly as a school teacher in regional Victoria, then travelled as a busker in Europe. Ellis wrote music for theatre groups and plays before performing with Melbourne bands. Ellis was also a member of The Blackeyed Susans, Busload of Faith, Kim Salmon and the Surrealists and has been a member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds since 1994. Turner and White have a shared musical history via numerous common bands during the 1980s and early 1990s. Outside Dirty Three's activities, both have since contributed to other artists and groups. White's previous group Feral Dinosaurs also featured Conway Savage, also a member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and The Blackeyed Susans. White also played on records by Hunters and Collectors and Tex, Don and Charlie. On ANZAC Day (25 April) 1992, Dirty Three played their first gig‚Äîat the Baker's Arms Hotel, Richmond. At the trio's first live show, Ellis attached a guitar pick-up to his violin with a rubber band, providing the instrument with a distorted, feedback-drenched tone unlike the violin's more traditional sound. In 1992, they recorded a self-titled cassette of 12-tracks in Turner's bedroom (aka Scuzz Studio). Dirty Three played all over Melbourne's inner city in Abbotsford, then Fitzroy, Richmond and St. Kilda.BOMBLOG: Venom P. Stinger by Tyler Curtis In 1993 copies of the Dirty Three cassette were given away at their early gigs. During 1994 they were the support act for international groups Pavement, Beastie Boys and John Spencer Blues Explosion. In July that year, Torn & Frayed Records issued the band's eponymous album. According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane, it was \\"[b]rimming with Ellis's alternately subtle and dramatic violin flourishes, Turner's tensile guitar lines and White's sympathetic drumming, [and] was a strong introduction to the band's atmospheric musical palate\\". In November 1994 their next album, Sad & Dangerous, was issued on the Poon Village label and included tracks from the trio's earlier cassette. The album, along with subsequent tours with Sonic Youth, John Cale, and Pavement, led to a record deal with Chicago's Touch and Go Records. In March 1995 the group started a United States tour with a gig in San Francisco. In May they performed at the Music West Festival in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Subsequently, that year they toured the US four times, then toured Europe with gigs in Greece, Germany and the United Kingdom. They toured Israel with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, then back in London in August they performed with Cave ‚Äì who was also a participant on the Palace project ‚Äì providing a live soundtrack for the Carl Dreyer silent film The Passion of Joan of Arc, at the National Film Theatre. They performed at the Big Day Out series of concerts in January 1996 ‚Äì for the Melbourne show they were joined on stage by Cave. Later in 1996 they toured the US again; one of the shows was at Maxwell's, New Jersey. In September that year they issued their next album, Horse Stories, which was voted by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the top three albums of the year. In March 1998 the band issued Ocean Songs, which Billboards Chris Morris felt was \\"an unexpected new direction\\" where \\"the sound is still brazenly live, the atmosphere is generally rapturous and lyrical, instead of explosive and febrile\\". The album peaked in the top 50 on the ARIA Albums Chart. In October 2010 Ocean Songs was listed in the book 100 Best Australian Albums. It was described as displaying \\"an Australian sound that had never been heard before, one that was aware of our vast landscape but was reared in the urban landscapes of our various inner-city underground scenes\\". In May 1998 they started a two-month US tour. The group provided five new tracks for the soundtrack of John Curran's debut feature film Praise (1998). In March 2000 Dirty Three released another studio album, Whatever You Love, You Are which McFarlane found showed \\"deep, rich, emotional musical vistas, and furthered the band's connection to the music and approach of jazz great John Coltrane\\". In 2002, Dirty Three toured Taiwan together with US indie rocker Chan Marshall (aka Cat Power) and both artists returned in 2004. Also in 2004, they gigged at the Meredith Music Festival where a rain storm threatened their set, Ellis later remembered \\"we just went out and played like our lives depended on it ... and you all went for it; otherwise it just fell to pieces\\". In late 2005, Dirty Three released their seventh major album, Cinder. Although following in the spirit of Ocean Songs, it diverges from their previous works: it was their first album to feature vocals (from Marshall and from Sally Timms of The Mekons), albeit on two of nineteen tracks. Its tracks are generally shorter and more concise; and instead of their usual live-in-the-studio technique they recorded each member's work individually. In 2006 they toured Malaysia, Hong Kong, China and Taiwan. In May 2007 the band curated a weekend of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival, booking bands they admired in addition to performing twice themselves. In November they issued a two-disk DVD set, The Dirty Three; the first disc shows a live concert from Tokyo, Japan, shot in HD by Taiyo Films, and the second disc contains various live performances from 1994 to 2006, a documentary and interviews. Film director Darcy Maine completed the documentary on the band's history. In February 2012 the group released Toward the Low Sun, and in March, they performed at the Sydney Opera House. The album peaked in the top 40 on the ARIA Albums Chart and appeared in the top 50 on Billboards Top Heatseekers Chart. ==Collaborations== Since 1996 Dirty Three's violinist Warren Ellis has been a member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Ellis and Mick Turner have each released solo albums. In addition, Turner and Jim White have released several extended plays as The Tren Brothers, and appear as backing musicians on albums by Cat Power, Bonnie 'Prince' Billy and PJ Harvey (White drums). Turner is also an internationally exhibited painter with his own work gracing the covers of their major albums except Sad & Dangerous. He also runs the band's own record label, Anchor & Hope Records. In 1999, Dirty Three with Low, recorded an In the Fishtank session for Konkurrent Records. Dirty Three have released albums on Touch & Go Records and have toured with Nick Cave, Sonic Youth, Low, Pavement, Throwing Muses, Cat Power, PJ Harvey, Bonnie 'Prince' Billy, Devendra Banhart, Josh T. Pearson, Shannon Wright and The Pogues. During their career the group have spent much of their time overseas, when not performing together Turner is based in Melbourne, White lives in New York, and Ellis in Paris. ==Style== Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane compared the band to 1970s jazz rockers, MacKenzie Theory, writing that the group's \\"rumbling, dynamic sound incorporated open-ended, improvisational, electric rock ... minus the jazz- rock histrionics\\". In describing the group's sound, music journalists have mentioned ballads, folk, rock, classical, chamber music, free jazz and blues, Celtic music, other European folk styles and Indian raga. ==Discography== Warren Ellis performing with Dirty Three, Milan, May 2007 Jim White performing with Dirty Three, Manchester Cathedral, November 2012 According to various sources: Studio albums * Dirty Three (Scuzz Production SCUZZ001, 1993) * Dirty Three (Torn & Frayed Torn CD6, 1994) * Sad & Dangerous (Poon Village PV27, 1994) * Horse Stories (Anchor & Hope AH001CD/Touch & Go TG165CD, 1996) * Ocean Songs (Bella Union BELLACD3, 1998) #44 AUS https://australian- charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Dirty+Three * Whatever You Love, You Are (Bella Union BELLACD16, 2000) * She Has No Strings Apollo (Bella Union BELLACD44, 2003) * Cinder (Anchor & Hope AH008CD, 2005) * Toward the Low Sun (Anchor & Hope AH010, 2012) #31 AUS, #43 US Heatseekers https://www.billboard.com/music/dirty-three Compilation albums * Lowlands (Anchor & Hope AHX02S, 2000) Live albums * Live!

The battle was fought August 7‚Äì9, 1864 between what are now Medora and Sentinel Butte, North Dakota. It was an extension of the conflict begun in the Dakota War of 1862. Sully successfully marched through the badlands encountering only moderate resistance from the Sioux. General Alfred Sully ==Background== In the aftermath of the Dakota War of 1862, the U.S. government continued to punish the Sioux, including those who had not participated in the war. Large military expeditions into Dakota Territory in 1863 pushed most of the Sioux to the western side of the Missouri River and made safer the frontier of white settlement in Minnesota and the eastern Dakotas. An important impetus to another military campaign against the Sioux was the desire to protect lines of communication with recently discovered goldfields in Montana and Idaho. The lifeline for the American gold miners were steamboats plying the Missouri River through the heart of Sioux territory.Clodfelter, p. 156 During the winter of 1863-1864, Sully's superior, Major General John Pope ordered Sully to establish several forts along the Missouri River and in the eastern Dakotas to secure the communication routes to the goldfields and to eliminate the Sioux threat to the settlers east of the Missouri River. Sully's army was the largest ever assembled to combat the Plains Indians, comprising more than 4,000 men, many of them in support and supply roles along the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers.Barsness, John and Dickinson, William. \\"Cannoneer's Hop: The Sully Campaign, 1864 Montana: The Magazine of Western History, Vol. 16, No. 3 (Summer 1966), p. 29 Sully established Fort Rice on the Missouri River in what is now North Dakota on July 7, 1864. From there, he led 2,200 men into western Dakota Territory. In the Battle of Killdeer Mountain on July 28, Sully defeated about 1,600 Sioux warriors. After the battle the Sioux, along with their women and children, scattered into the Badlands west of Killdeer Mountain, near where the present-day South Unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park is located. The Dakota badlands are characterized by \\"deep, impassable ravines\\" and \\"high rugged hills.\\"United States War Department. The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the official Records of the United States and the Confederacy, Series 1, Vol 41 (part l), p. 135 Although running short of rations, Sully decided to continue his pursuit of the Sioux. A Blackfoot scout said he knew a route through the Badlands passable by Sully's wagon train. After resting, Sully and his men plunged into the unknown terrain ahead.Clodfelter, pp172-176 His objective was to continue to pursue the Sioux through the Badlands and then resupply his expedition by marching north to the Yellowstone River where two steamboats full of rations awaited him.Clodfelter, p. 178 Sully followed the Heart River upstream, entering the Badlands on August 5. \\"One minute they were rolling along on what seemed like limitless prairie; the next men and horses were lost in a maze of narrow gullies and malevolent steeps.\\" Traveling with Sully was an emigrant wagon train of miners and their wives and children.Barsness and Dickinson, p. 27 Sully pursued the Sioux through the difficult terrain of the Badlands near present-day Theodore Roosevelt National Park. Lakota leader Sitting Bull described the Indians in the Battle of the Badlands as Hunkpapas, Sans Arcs, and Miniconjou Lakota, Yanktonai, and others.Clodfelter, p. 186 ==The battle== On August 6, Sully and his men camped on the banks of the Little Missouri River. The next morning a small group of Sioux opened hostilities by raiding the horse herd of the Seventh Iowa Cavalry, and ambushing one company of the regiment. Hundreds of Sioux warriors appeared on the hilltops near Sully's camp. A few cannon shots dispersed them, but the soldiers spent a nervous night. The next morning Sully and his column moved forward through the badlands. Sully took all precautions for defense, but a large number of Indians warriors‚ÄîSully estimated their numbers at 1,000‚Äîappeared on the bluffs and hills at his front and flanks. The Indians showered arrows on the soldiers, and attempted to creep close enough to do serious harm to Sully's army, strung out over three or four miles in the rugged terrain. Sully responded with cannon fire and sallies by some of his cavalry. The assault by the Sioux was more desultory than determined. Near the end of the day, Sully's Blackfoot guide was wounded.Clodfelter, pp 183-185 Despite the opposition of the Sioux, Sully and his men advanced about 10 miles on August 8. The next day, Sully was again confronted by a large number of Indians at his front who harassed his passage. About noon Sully broke out of the Badlands onto a large, level plain. With room to maneuver and deploy artillery, he soon dispersed the Indians and the battle was over. Sully found the remains of a large, recently vacated Indian camp. The Indians had apparently scattered in all directions.Clodfelter, pp 187-188 Sully estimated the Indian loss in the battle at 100 killed. That seems much exaggerated as the Indians remained at long distance. Sully's losses were probably only the Blackfoot scout and a dozen soldiers wounded. ==Aftermath== The Sioux strategy in the Battle of the Badlands, which was more of a running skirmish than a battle, appeared to have been to harass the soldiers, retard their advance, and deprive them and their horses of water. That strategy came close to working after the end of hostilities as Sully and his men struggled across parched desert to reach the Yellowstone River, some 50 miles (80 km) distant. The men were on short rations and only a pint of coffee each, made with alkaline water, per day; the livestock of the expedition died of thirst in large numbers. On August 12, the soldiers reached the Yellowstone and found there the two steamboats loaded with supplies. With great hardship because of lack of grass for horses and low water, Sully then marched downstream, finding on his arrival at Fort Union at the junction of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers, that the Sioux had stampeded and stolen all but two of the horses belonging to the fort. Lacking horses and with an army of worn-out men, Sully abandoned his plan to continue the expedition against the Sioux.Clodfelter, pp 189-190 The Sully expedition of 1864 pushed the majority of the hostile Sioux west of the Missouri River into their last strongholds of the Powder River country and the Black Hills. The U.S. would send another large army against them in 1865 in the Powder River Expedition, but they would successfully resist. ==Opposing Forces== United States Department of the Northwest: MG John Pope (not present in the field) {  ! width=25%  Division ! width=25%  Brigade !

Mikhael was reporting as a cameraman for the Coptic Orthodox Christian TV station in Cairo and was shot in the head while filming what was supposed to be a peaceful demonstration. Mina was reporting as a political activist blogger and was shot in the shoulder and leg. ==Background== Egypt's Coptic Christians, who make up more than ten percent of Egypt's 85 million people, say they are repeatedly attacked and have long complained of discrimination in both jobs and politics. In Egypt, Christians have felt vulnerable for many years, even before Hosni Mubarak was deposed in 2011. Of far more concern, however, was the sense that the army was involved in the bloodshed. ==Incident== On 9 October 2011, thousands, mainly Coptic Christians, joined a march from the Shubra district of northern Cairo to the state TV building in Maspero Square where they intended to hold a peaceful sit-in. The sit-in was organized to protest the state's TV position of fanning the flames of anti-Christian agitation. The demonstrators were assaulted first by attackers in plain clothes then military armored cars run over people. Thousands joined in the street violence, hurling stones and firing live ammunition into the crowd. What started as a peaceful protest march ended up with 25 dead, 21 of them Coptic Christians, some run over by armored vehicles driven by soldiers supposedly policing the event, others clashing with Muslim extremist. Danial's sister said, \\"Mina was a very kind, righteous person, and he dreamed of Egypt becoming like Europe, where the young people don't have to travel abroad to live their dreams,\\". Doctors and Interior Ministry officials said bullet wounds accounted for most of the deaths, including that of Mina Daniel, who was shot in the shoulder and leg. More than 300 others were wounded in four hours of street fights, the Health Ministry said. \\"Witnesses, victims and doctors said Monday that demonstrators were killed when military-led security forces drove armored vehicles over as many as six people and fired live ammunition into the crowds. Doctors at a Coptic hospital showed journalists 17 bodies, including one with a crushed skull and others with mangled limbs\\". == Reactions == Two media rights groups are calling on Egyptian authorities to investigate the deaths. The International Press Institute (IPI) is concerned about the reports of attacks on private television station while filming deadly clashes between protestors speaking out against perceived religious discrimination, and the military who were also supported by a group of protestors. ==References== Category:Mass media in Egypt Category:Massacres in Egypt Category:Massacres in 2011 Category:Coptic history Category:Attacks on religious buildings and structures in Africa Category:2011 in Egypt Category:Egyptian revolution of 2011 Category:Journalists killed in Egypt Category:Journalists killed while covering the Egyptian revolution of 2011 Category:Protest-related deaths Category:Egyptian journalists Category:October 2011 events in Africa ","title":"Wael Mikhael incident"},{"id":"35235350","text":"Island Grove is an unincorporated community in Grove Township, Jasper County, Illinois, United States.

His courtesy name was Jing An (ÈùôÂÆâ). Minggatu was born in Plain White Banner (now Plain and Bordered White Banner, Xilin Gol League, Inner Mongolia) of the Qing Empire. He was of the Sharaid clan. His name first appeared in official Chinese records in 1713, among the Kangxi Emperor's retinue, as a shengyuan (state-subsidized student) of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau. He worked there at a time when Jesuit missionaries were in charge of calendar reforms. He also participated in the work of compiling and editing three very important books in astronomy and joined the team of China's area measurement. From 1724 up to 1759, he worked at the Imperial Observatory. He participated in drafting and editing the calendar and the study of the armillary sphere. His seminal work The Quick Method for Obtaining the Precise Ratio of Division of a Circle (), which was completed after his death by his son Mingshin, and students (among them his most gifted pupil Chen Jihin and an intendant in the minister of finance, Zhang), was a significant contribution to the development of mathematics in China. He was the first person in China who calculated infinite series and obtained more than 10 formulae. In the 1730s, he first established and used what was later to be known as Catalan numbers.The 18th century Chinese discovery of the Catalan numbers The Jesuit missionaries' influence can be seen by many traces of European mathematics in his works, including the use of Euclidean notions of continuous proportions, series addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, series reversion, and the binomial theorem. Minggatu's work is remarkable in that expansions in series, trigonometric and logarithmic were apprehended algebraically and inductively without the aid of differential and integral calculus. In 1742 he participated in the revision of the Compendium of Observational and Computational Astronomy. In 1756, he participated in the surveying of the Dzungar Khanate (renamed Xinjiang), which was incorporated into the Qing Empire by the Qianlong Emperor. It was due to his geographical surveys in Xinjiang that the Complete Atlas of the Empire (the first atlas of China drawn with scientific methods) was finished. From 1760-1763, shortly before his death, he was administrator of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau. ==Later recognition== In 1910, Japanese mathematician Yoshio Mikami mentioned that Minggatu was the first Chinese who had ever entered into the field of analytical research methods. Mathematician Dr. P. J. Larcombe of Derby University published 7 papers on Minggatu and his work in 1999, including the stimulus of Jesuit missionary, engineer, mathematician and geographer Pierre Jartoux, who brought three infinite series to China early in the 1700s. On May 26, 2002, the minor planet 28242 was named after Minggatu as 28242 Mingantu. The nomination ceremony and traditional meeting were held in Minggatu's hometown in August 2002. More than 500 delegates and 20,000 local residents gathered together to celebrate and a conference on \\"The Science Contribution of Ming Antu\\" was held.

When not on the tournament circuit he practiced in Miami, where he was well known for hitting against a wall for hours, which gave him callouses on his racket hand a good quarter of an inch thick that he would shave down at night with a razor blade. He toured at times with Ecuadorians Washington Suarez and Davis Cupper Miguel Olvera. Zuleta had the nickname El Barco (\\"The Ship\\") in his home country because he invariably returned there from his tennis tours with suitcases full of tennis equipment and clothing that he received free from manufacturers as goodwill advertising. Perhaps his most conspicuous debut on the tennis stage was his first-round encounter on the grass of the U.S. Championships at Forest Hills, NY in 1963 with then U.S. No. 1 Chuck McKinley, who had just won Wimbledon two months earlier.

He was shot six times by local gangsters, damaging his jaw and the vision of one eye, for exposing corruption. ==Background== Rinku Singh Rahi has been fighting corruption in his own department and state-run schemes since 2009. He was denied access to information on his own department. Instead, an attempt on his life was made allegedly at the behest of Principal Secretary Navtej Singh, and other department officials during the Mayawati government. He started a hunger strike in Lucknow hoping the Akhilesh Yadav government would pay heed to his demands for a reply on his pending RTI application; a criminal investigationinto the corruptions charges; and act against miscreants but instead was admitted to a psychiatric ward. ==Life and early career== He was born at Aligarh in a lower middle-class family on 20 May 1982. He did his elementary schooling in Aligarh and completed his BTech degree in Metallurgy at NIT, Jamshedpur in 2002. In the same year, he scored All India 17th rank in GATE that assured him a seat in his desired stream at any top technological institute. He opted for a civil service career instead. In pursuit of his objective, he undertook various civil services examinations/interviews. Having passed the Uttar Pradesh Provincial Civil Services examination in 2004, he was posted as District social welfare officer at Muzaffarnagar in 2008. He showed interest in social development from his early years and took initiative in establishing a \\"Library\\" and \\"Adult education center\\" at Aligarh. He was then posted as a coordinater at the state-run coaching institute for IAS and IPS aspirants from the Dalit community at Aligarh. As of 2012 he is posted in Badhohi constituency of Sant Ravidas Nagar district as a social welfare officer. ==Muzaffarnagar welfare fund corruption scandal== The social welfare department at Muzaffarnagar distributed over annually to beneficiaries under various state-run welfare schemes. Rahi ordered an inquiry into the allocation of funds over the last five years, soon after he arrived. He found serious discrepancies: * Out of the allocated funds to be distributed as part of Old- age pension scheme, money was taken for 62,447 people but only 47,707 beneficiaries received it. Each beneficiary is entitled to 3,600 rupees annually. * There were no records for distributed to 22,000 OBC students and distributed to all BPLF families and General category ‚Äì other than OBC, SC, ST, and Minorities. Rahi complained to his seniors and also informed Bhuvneesh Kumar, a District Magistrate of Muzaffaranagar, about the irregularities. Kumar said that a few days before the attack Rahi had told him of the irregularities, and had planned to computerise a record of what he had discovered, but he could do that, he was attacked. RTI request Rinku Singh filed a Right to Information (RTI) application on 28 November 2007, but never received a reply within the mandatory period of 30 days. He followed up by filing a complaint at Central Information Commission (CIC) under section 18 of the Commission. CIC issued a notice to Public Information Officer (PIO) for explanation and demanded he supply the information within the mandated time. PIO replied to CIC on 2 February 2009. CIC then directed PIO to provide the information on two of five queries. CIC rejected the remaining three queries, claiming they did not fall within the definition of \\"Information\\" as defined in the RTI Act. Armed attack After Rahi's complaints, armed miscreants shot him six time when he was playing badminton on the morning of 26 March 2009. His jaw was severely damaged and he lost the vision of one eye, but survived. Police found that the attack was carried out by local gangsters at the behest of welfare department officials. Police arrested nine people, including Mukesh Chaudhary, a Samajwadi Party (SP) leader, and Ashok Kashyap, an assistant accountant at the welfare department. According to police, Mukesh Chaudhary was annoyed that Rahi did not sanction scholarships for some students and Ashok Kashyap was annoyed as Rahi had ordered a departmental inquiry into the alleged corruption. Kumar issued an order to attach the property of Chaudary, who had been enriched by over five years. Inquiry committee After Rahi was attacked, an inquiry committee was set up under Alka Tandon, director of the social welfare department ‚Äì Meerut. The committee found no records of funds spent in the last five years by the Social welfare, corroborating Rahi's allegations. The committee also found embezzlement to the tune of , associated with various welfare schemes in 2009, according to Narendra Kumar Chowdhary, Social welfare department director. The Committee submitted the report with findings that included: * No records were found regarding the scholarships at 101 schools. * No records were found about five years of verification of people who are getting benefits on name of Elderly[Old-age] schemes and Widow pension schemes. * Money was distributed to families having no daughter as part of the Daughter's marriage scheme. The report also hinted that the local officials of the education department's involvement in the malpractices of Scholarship scheme. The inquiry team found accounting discrepancies to the tune of crores of rupees in almost all the schemes. Discovery of further corruption Rahi said that he had information that of around to that were allocated to Muzaffarnagar's Social welfare department in 2008‚Äì09, a large amount was unused. He believed that the reply to the RTI application would expose another scam in the department. Rahi said that he sought to discover where the unused funds went, and filed an application under the Right to Information Act, 2005 to discover who beneficiaries were, but did not receive the full details, and had therefore filed an appeal. Rahi also said that he had compromised by limiting his request to one year, having been told that details for other years were not available. Hunger strike and attempted hospitalisation Speaking at a one-day token fast launched at Jantar Mantar on 25 March 2012 by anti- corruption activist Anna Hazare, Rahi announced that he too would undertake a hunger strike starring 26 March 2012 at Lucknow, in part because his RTI request had been rejected. Lucknow police, intending to disrupt the protest after midnight, first brought in doctors to check his condition and forcibly evicted him from the protest site. They tried to get him admitted first to a local hospital and then to a psychiatric ward of Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University (CSMMU), but the hospital refused to admit him after neither Rahu nor his family provided consent. On 28 March 2012, the Government of Uttar Pradesh formed a two-member committee, chaired by the Meerut commissioner, to probe Rahi's allegations. Awadesh Pradesh, the social welfare minister, said that the committee was expected to submit their findings in two months. Retaliation Facing criticism and media coverage, he was transferred to his hometown, Aligarh. Anti-corruption activist Arvind Kejriwal, criticised the government crackdown on Rahi, saying that Rahi \\"raised a genuine voice against corruption\\", accused the ruling party of direct involvement in \\"corruption, murder and assault\\", and criticised them for failing to provide protection to Rahi. Rahi continued to protest in Aligarh. He was given an insignificant position ‚Äì as a coordinator at the Dr. B.R.Ambedkar IAS PCS Coaching Centre. He said that senior officials of the police department had refused to co-operate with him after he provided them with details of the scam, and that RTI requests had not been honoured. ==Notes== * See also, Attacks on RTI activists in India. ==External links== *Whistleblower PCS Officer Sits On Fast In Lucknow, Police Takes Him To Trauma Centre *On hunger strike, whistleblower bureaucrat picked up by cops and sent to a mental institution *Rinku now a days *Rinku's letter in Hindi language Hindi language *Rinku Singh Rahi ‚Äì A Man against Corrupt System ‚Äì price of being honest Civil Servant.

It was published by John Lane as part of a three book contract. Windy McPherson's Son is Sherwood Anderson's first novel. ==Development history== In September 1907, the Anderson family (at that time just Sherwood, his wife Cornelia and son Robert) moved from Cleveland to Elyria, Ohio, where Anderson became head of the Anderson Manufacturing Company (name changed to American Merchants Company after 1911).Townsend (1987), 60-61 As part of the family's new home, Anderson set aside an attic where he would escape the stresses of business and family life.Townsend (1987), 63 It was during one winter between 1907 and 1912 that both this room and his office (where Frances Shute, his secretary, would sometimes stay late typing drafts of his first two novels) served as the settings in which Windy McPherson's Sons was composed.Townsend (1987), 66 and 76 Though it is likely that most of his first novel was composed in Elyria, there is some evidence pointing to possible edits made between those early years and the novel's publication in 1916.Duffey (1966), 49 Obvious parallels can be drawn between the plot of Anderson's own life and that of his first novel.Duffey (1966), 50 The beginning section of the novel is inspired by his youth, the second \\"...combined the ways he had tried to make money in Chicago and Ohio...\\" and the marriage between Sam and Sue resembles the one between Sherwood and Cornelia.Townsend (1987), 66White (1994), xvii-xix The characters of Mary Underwood and Janet Eberly were likely inspired by Trillena White, a high school teacher that befriended Anderson while he attended the Wittenberg Academy in Springfield, Ohio between 1899 and June 4, 1900, and stayed for a time with the Andersons in Elyria.Townsend (1987), 42-43 and 68Rideout (2006), 226 In addition to the personal connections between Windy McPherson's Son and the author's life made by biographers and critics, the influence of other writers is also seen in the book. Anderson himself said of his early writing that he had, \\"come to novel writing by novel reading.\\"Anderson quote by way of Townsend (1987), 67-68 and White (1994), xxvii In particular, William Dean Howells (whose writing Anderson disliked), Arnold Bennett, Thomas Hardy, Henry Fuller, Frank Norris, Theodore Dreiser, and George Borrow, are all mentioned by Anderson biographer Kim Townsend as authors Anderson would have been reading and discussing at the time he wrote Windy McPherson's Son.Townsend (1987), 68 In his 1951 biography of Anderson, Irving Howe disagrees with Townsend and even Anderson's own statement, arguing that other than the \\"early social novels of H.G. Wells and the radical-adventure stories of Jack London...Anderson's early novels were all too much his own, reflecting in their style the natural inclination of a poorly educated writer to strain for the literary and lapse into the colloquial.\\"Howe (1951), 90 ==Plot== Windy McPherson's Son is the story of Sam McPherson's rise in the world of business and search for emotional enlightenment in later life. McPherson starts out as an ambitious newsboy in Caxton, Ohio, with drunkard of a father who constantly embarrasses him. Eventually, after his mother's death and an episode with a middle-aged schoolteacher, McPherson leaves Caxton for Chicago. In Chicago, he gets a job as a buyer of farm implements and establishes his reputation in business. While his professional life is blossoming, his personal life suffers. After meeting Sue Rainey, the daughter of his boss Colonel Rainey, they get married and twice fail to have children. Following a business deal that forces his father-in-law out of his own company, McPherson and Sue Rainey separate. One day, once McPherson had become quite wealthy, he gets a telegram saying that Colonel Rainey committed suicide. This causes Sam to realize that he is unhappy with his life. This feeling inspires him to leave Chicago and travel all over becoming involved in various adventures. Finally, McPherson's comes across a promiscuous and alcoholic mother of three children. A deal is made and McPherson gets custody of the children. Showing up with the children at Sue's current place of residence, the five of them become family. ==ReferencesSources== * Duffey, Bernard (1966). \\"From The Chicago Renaissance in American Letters: A Critical History\\". in White, Ray Lewis (ed).

It is possibly New Zealand's most common stick insect. Clitarchus hookeri is often green in appearance, but can also be brown or red. ==Description== Male Clitarchus hookeri Female Clitarchus hookeri Clitarchus hookeri is a large stick insect. This species demonstrates sexual dimorphism. Female specimens grow from 81 ‚Äì 106 mm and males from 67 ‚Äì 74 mm. The colour can be variable, even in the same location, ranging from bright green to grey, brown or buff. Unlike many tropical stick insects, Clitarchus hookeri is flightless. ==Habitat and distribution== Clitarchus hookeri is found from Northland to the Wellington region in the south of the North Island of New Zealand. On the South Island it is not as widespread, being found mainly in eastern coastal areas from Nelson and Marlborough in the north through Canterbury to its southern limit in Dunedin. It is also found in Great Britain, where it has been introduced. The UK population is all-female but came from a sexual population in Taranaki. The species is most commonly found on manuka, but has also been observed feeding on kanuka, pohutukawa, Muehlenbeckia australis, roses, white rata and Coprosma. == Life cycle & mating behaviour == Mating pair of Clitarchus hookeri'Clitarchus hookeri are hemimetabolous, meaning that the nymphs grow through a series of six instars before a final moult into their adult stage. Adults are found during the summer months and are mostly active at night. During the day they hide among the branches of their host trees, before emerging at sunset to feed and mate. Females hang off the edge of branches feeding on the leaves of their host plant and signalling to males by releasing a mix of volatile chemicals. The long-legged adult males move around at night in search of mates. Males court females by laying his forelegs across her for between 10 minutes to 1 hour, after which he climbs onto the female and attempts to clasp onto her sub genital plate using his genital claspers. If the male successfully attaches to the female, mating begins when the female's operculum opens and the male inserts his genitalia. Males remain attached to the female for extended periods, ranging from one through to 10 nights, during which they may mate multiple times. A Clitarchus hookeri moulting Clitarchus hookeri is geographically parthenogenetic, meaning that in some localities females do not mate to reproduce. Instead, they are able to produce fertile eggs without mating. In the South Island Clitarchus hookeri males are rare or absent, while in the North Island both asexual and sexual populations occur. Although females who reproduce asexually lay similar number of eggs and have similar hatching success as those who reproduce sexually, their eggs took longer to hatch. Eggs from parthenogenic females took between 21‚Äì23 weeks, while eggs from mated females took between 9‚Äì16 weeks. Females from parthenogenetic populations show a barrier to fertilization in captivity when provided with mates, however, males cannot distinguish between sexual and parthenogenetic females. However, two wild populations in New Zealand have reverted to sexual reproduction very recently. Clitarchus hookeri egg illustration by Des Helmore ==Phylogeography== With the exception of the West Coast of the South Island, the current distribution of Clitarchus hookeri is widespread on both the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It is thought that its distribution restricted at the Last Glacial Maximum to refugia in the northern North Island and the east coast of the South Island. It is thought that parthenogenetic female members of the species were able to recolonize areas more favourably following the glacial retreat. South Island individuals and those from the southern region of the North Island form a single clade with very low genetic diversity. Upper North Island individuals are much more diverse genetically. It is thought that the lack of genetic diversity in the lower North Island/South Island population to be due to its younger lineage than their sexually reproducing relatives. ==See also== ‚Ä¢ List of stick insects of New Zealand ==References * Category:Clitarchus Category:Phasmatidae Category:Phasmatidae of New Zealand Category:Endemic fauna of New Zealand ","title":"Clitarchus hookeri"},{"id":"35235770","text":"Zygaena orana is a species of moth in the family Zygaenidae.

It contains two genera, Strasburgeria and Ixerba. Both genera have simple, evergreen, alternated leaves, often in worl-like clusters, with gland-tipped serrations, hermaphroditic, pentamerous flowers with persistent sepals, clawed petals, flat and long filaments that extend beyond the petals and a persistent style with a punctiform stigma. Fossil pollen named Bluffopollis scabratus, found in deposits from the Paleocene to the Miocene, is almost identical to the pollen of Strasburgeria, although only half its size. The fact that it was found in western and southern Australia and in New Zealand suggests that the most recent common ancestor of Strasburgeria and Ixerba had developed by the time of the break-up of East-Gondwana. Recent phylogenetic analysis resulted in the inclusion of the genus Ixerba (previously assigned to the monotypic family Ixerbaceae) in the Strasburgeriaceae. The following tree represents the most recent insights in the relationship between the Strasburgeriaceae and other families. While both Ixerba brexioides and Strasburgeria robusta share a base chromosome number of x = 25, I. brexioides is diploid (2n = 2x = 50), while S. robusta is icosaploid (2n = 20x = 500). The massive polyploidy in S. robusta may have furthered the adaptations that let it survive on the ultramafic substrates found in the montane forest of New Caledonia. ==Species== * Ixerba brexioides * Strasburgeria robusta ==ReferencesExternal sources== * Strasburgeriaceae L.

It stars Gavin Bellour, Mad Men‚Äôs Elisabeth Moss and Matisyahu, a popular American reggae and alternative rock musician who makes his screen debut in the movie. ==Plot== Buddy Gilbert (Gavin Bellour) is a struggling musician living in NYC. He spends his days touring the northeast with his pet turtle, playing community centers, dive bars and coffee shops because, he says, it beats a 9-to-5. One day, Buddy overhears his neighbor Susan (Elisabeth Moss) get in a particularly bad argument with her boyfriend and, although he barely knows her, he finds himself taking her out for some cheer-me-up ice cream. When Buddy is leaving the following day for a tour, Susan asks if she can tag along, if for no other reason than to get out of the city a while. Hesitant at first, Buddy obliges, and finds himself spending a week traveling around with someone who, just days before, was no more than \\"the girl on the other side of the wall\\". From a rough biker bar to a 100-year-old birthday party and other odd stops along the way, record label rejections to family connections, Buddy and Susan make their way from NYC to Philadelphia's Main Line, and they come to realize that it's not the road's end that matters, but rather the road itself. ==Cast== *Gavin Bellour as Buddy *Elisabeth Moss as Susan *Lee Garlington as Susan's Mom *Matisyahu as Chassid *Annabelle Gurwitch as Rita *Tovah Feldshuh as Buddy's Mom *Tim Guinee as Pete *Dick Latessa as Grandfather *Catherine A.

She received an education at Lashio's Guardian Angel's Convent School. At the age of 19, she organized ethnic Kokang forces, nicknamed the Olive's Boys, an army of over a thousand soldiers and consolidated control of opium trade routes from the highlands to lowlands. She dominated Kokang's opium trade from the end of World War II to the early 1960s. In the 1950s, after the Nationalist defeat and their subsequent expulsion from mainland China, she partnered with the Kuomintang to establish opium trade routes along the Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia). From 1948 to 1950, she was married to Twan Sao Wen, the son of Tamaing's chieftain, and had a son, Duan Jipu (ÊÆµÂêâÂçú), in 1950. Her son is a teacher in Chiang Mai, Thailand. From the 1950s to the mid-1960s, she was the commander of the Kokang Kakweye (People's Defense Forces). She was a prominent figure in opium trafficking and gold trading. She was arrested in 1962, along with her brother Jimmy, a member of parliament in Yangon, by Burmese authorities, to remove them from power and place Kokang territory under Burmese administration. She was imprisoned at Insein Prison and released in 1968. Yang was known to be a bisexual woman who carried on affairs with film actresses and singers, including Wah Wah Win Shwe (). In the late 1980s, she was recruited by Khin Nyunt to help broker ceasefires in Burma with ethnic rebel groups. After her release, she reportedly spent her final years as a nun.

He was associated with Bo Xilai (the former Communist Party of China Committee Secretary for Chongqing, and a member of the Chinese Politburo). Heywood was found dead in a hotel room in Chongqing, and initial official reports (which have subsequently been challenged) attributed his death to alcohol poisoning. Media reports have suggested the former chief of police under Bo, Wang Lijun, may have had information concerning Heywood's death. Soon after Heywood's death (6 February 2012), Wang fled to the US consulate in Chengdu, and allegedly told US diplomats of Heywood having been poisoned, and Bo's family was involved in corruption. The incident precipitated Bo's high-profile sacking two weeks later. According to a reinvestigation by the Chinese authorities, evidence indicates Heywood having been murdered, with Gu Kailai, Bo Xilai's wife, and Zhang Xiaojun, an orderly at Bo's home, of being \\"highly suspected\\", according to Xinhua News. On 26 July 2012, Gu Kailai was charged with the murder of Heywood and in August was convicted of the crime. ==Personal life== Born in 1970, Heywood attended Harrow, an independent school for boys. He graduated in international relations from the University of Warwick. Fluent in Chinese, Heywood spent more than a decade in China. He was married to Lulu Wang (ÁéãÈú≤Èú≤), a Chinese national from Dalian, and the couple had two children; a boy named Peter, and a daughter, Olivia, who were ages 7 and 11, respectively, at the time of his death. Both children attend the Beijing branch of Dulwich College. The family lived in a private, tree-lined neighbourhood of villas on the outskirts of Beijing. Heywood drove an S-type Jaguar, with a Union Jack bumper sticker. ==Career== Heywood served as an intermediary, linking Western companies wishing to do business in China to powerful figures in the Chinese political structure. Heywood ran a company named Heywood Boddington Associates, registered to his mother's house in London. In its filings, it claims to be a \\"multi-discipline consultancy focusing on serving the interests of UK businesses in the People's Republic of China\\". Heywood developed a business relationship with Gu Kailai, a lawyer, businesswoman, and the wife of Bo Xilai. Both Gu and Bo are children of once-prominent members of the Chinese Communist Party. Heywood appears to have played the role of a Bai Shoutao or white glove for the Bo family, doing business on their behalf, since, according to Chinese custom, a prominent party family could not involve themselves directly with financial dealings. Businessmen have complained that any foreign company wishing to work in Chongqing had to appoint Gu Kailai's law firm, Kailai Law (now Beijing Ang-dao Law), to act on its behalf. Failing to do so would almost certainly result in it being unable to attain required permissions and licences. It has been reported that Kailai Law charged exorbitant fees. Heywood's clients included Beijing Aston Martin dealerships and Rolls-Royce. He was also hired occasionally by Hakluyt & Company, a consultancy co-founded by a former officer of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). Rumors that Heywood might have been employed as an agent by MI6 have been denied by Foreign Secretary William Hague, an unusual move, as the British government typically refuses to comment on the identity of its agents. The Wall Street Journal later reported they had confirmed, after interviewing former and current British officials and others, that Heywood had since 2009 been regularly supplying information to MI6, although he was not an MI6 employee. Relationship with Bo Xilai and Gu Kailai Heywood had business links with Gu Kailai, the wife of Bo Xilai. He reportedly met with the Bo family in Dalian, the northeast metropolis where Bo was mayor from 1994 to 2000. Heywood was then working at a Dalian English-language school, and helped Bo's youngest son gain admission to Harrow. The Daily Telegraph reports that Heywood and Gu \\"shared a long and close personal relationship, but were not romantically involved.\\" Following a corruption investigation in 2007, Gu is said to have become increasingly paranoid. In 2010, she allegedly asked Heywood and other close associates to divorce their spouses and swear allegiance to her. The Daily Telegraph reported that Gu Kailai testified Heywood was murdered because he demanded ¬£1.4 million in compensation for the return of a half-share of ownership of a ¬£2 million house ‚Äì originally bought by Gu in 2000 ‚Äì in the hills overlooking Cannes. The court heard Heywood had blackmailed the family and threatened to expose their corrupt ownership of a villa in the French Riviera. As Heywood's relationship with the Bo‚ÄìGu family descended into acrimony, Gu stated that Heywood had threatened the safety of Bo's 25-year-old son, Guagua. ==Death== On 14 November 2011, Heywood was summoned to Chongqing by Gu Kailai. She sent Zhang Xiaojun (Âº†ÊôìÂÜõ) to bring him from Beijing to the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel (ÂçóÂ±±‰∏ΩÊôØÂ∫¶ÂÅáÈÖíÂ∫ó). Zhang Xiaojun is described as an 'orderly' in the Bo household. Aged 32, he used to serve as a bodyguard for Bo Yibo. He is also listed as the supervisor of the Guagua Technology Company, belonging to Bo Guagua. The Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel is a secluded, three-star hilltop retreat, also marketed as the Lucky Holiday Hotel. Gu Kailai hosted a banquet there in the past, but according to two sources quoted by The Daily Telegraph, she was not at the scene at the time of Heywood's murder. The hotel is located in and overlooks Nan'an District. Heywood was found in his hotel room, 26 hours after his death. The cause of death was given as alcohol poisoning. There was no autopsy, and he was cremated days later. Questions were raised later as friends described him as \\"not a serious drinker\\" (some reports have his family describing him as \\"a teetotaler\\"). An internal Chinese report confirmed that Heywood died from potassium cyanide added to his drink. However, further investigations led to new findings suggesting the death of Heywood was a murder committed by Gu Kailai. Aftermath Wang Lijun, who was the head of Chongqing police department as well as the vice mayor of Chongqing, was in charge of the investigation. According to a CPC internal report, Wang and his lieutenants were said to be under political pressure during the investigations. Soon Wang found the murder was related to Bo, who had been his superior for more than 10 years. After submitting the investigation report to Bo Xilai, Wang was suspended by Bo. Some of the police officers who participated in the investigation were arrested. In February 2012, Wang fled to the US consulate in Chengdu, precipitating the so-called Wang Lijun incident. On 14 March 2012, the Dalian-based billionaire Xu Ming, a close associate of Bo, disappeared. It was speculated that he was under arrest. Reports suggest Heywood's wife was employed by Xu. On 15 March 2012, Bo was removed from his post of party chief for Chongqing. On 10 April 2012, Bo was suspended from the Politburo and suspected of being involved in \\"serious disciplinary violations\\". The same day, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said that, according to the reinvestigation, the evidence indicated Heywood was a victim of homicide, of which Bo Xilai's wife, Gu Kailai, and Zhang Xiaojun, her bodyguard, were \\"strongly suspected\\". Bo was placed under house arrest in Beijing. Gu and Zhang were both arrested. The Communist Party chief in Nan'an, Xia Zeliang, was detained for questioning in April 2012; the official was a staunch ally of Bo. He was arrested and allegedly confessed that he prepared the poison and handed it to an employee of Bo. On 13 April 2012, Heywood's widow, Wang Lulu, visited the British Embassy in Beijing, and asked for a visa to travel to the UK with her two young children, reportedly concerned that the people who had killed her husband might come after her and her family. The entrance to the family's gated compound in Beijing was manned by troops from the People's Liberation Army, and police ordered her not to communicate with international journalists. According to The Daily Telegraph of 17 April 2012, UK Prime Minister David Cameron would meet Chinese publicity department head Li Changchun to discuss the Heywood case. The Boxun website reported that Bo's most influential supporter, the 9th ranking Politburo Standing Committee member Zhou Yongkang, was forced to make \\"tearful self-confessions\\" to Hu Jintao. Legal process On 26 July 2012, Gu Kailai was charged with the murder of Neil Heywood. On 9 August 2012, the trial of Gu was held and lasted only one day, as the defendant did not contest the charges.\\"Bo Xilai scandal: Police on trial in Gu Kailai 'cover-up'\\" BBC News, 10 August 2012 The same day, four policemen, all senior officers from Chongqing, where the UK businessman was killed, were formally accused of covering up the murder of Heywood and indicted. On 20 August 2012, the verdict was announced. Gu was sentenced to death but the sentence was suspended, which means that Gu is likely to face from 14 years to life in jail, as long as she does not commit any additional offences in the next two years. Zhang Xiaojun, a Bo family aide, was sentenced to nine years in jail for his involvement in the murder, which he admitted to. Following the verdict, Britain's embassy in China stated, in an emailed press release, that it had welcomed the investigation, adding \\"[we] consistently made clear to the Chinese authorities that we wanted to see the trials in this case conform to international human rights standards and for the death penalty not to be applied.\\" BBC News commented that \\"informed observers see the fingerprints of the Communist Party of China all over this outcome\\", stating that the trial's conclusion was \\"all too neat and uncannily suited to one particular agenda\\", that of limiting the scandal's damage. Both Zhang Xiaojun and Gu Kailai declined to exercise their right to an appeal. == Popular culture == In the 2019 film The Laundromat, Heywood (renamed Neil Maywood) was portrayed by actor Matthias Schoenaerts. ==See also== *Wang Lijun incident *Corruption in the People's Republic of China *Chongqing gang trials ==References== Category:Alumni of the University of Warwick Category:Bo Xilai Category:British businesspeople Category:British expatriates in China Category:British people murdered abroad Category:English murder victims Category:People educated at Harrow School Category:People from Kensington Category:People murdered in China Category:1970 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Murdered businesspeople ","title":"Neil Heywood"},{"id":"35236239","text":"Elroy Patrick Kromheer (born 15 January 1970) is a Dutch former footballer who played in The Football League for Reading and in the Scottish Football League for Motherwell.

Compared to the studies of media systems, transformation research is focused on the collective and individual actors who \\"demand, support, and manage change\\".Kleinsteuber (2010), p. 26. They can be found in governments, parties, NGOs, civil society organizations or interest groups. To the largest extent, transformation research addresses change from authoritarian to democratic media systems. Since transformation processes in media systems are always linked to the political and socioeconomic development, transformation research is not solely focused on the transformation of the media systems, but also on sectors like politics, economy, society, or culture. Transformation research is a comparative approach, since processes in different stages of the political or media system are compared. The approach is highly complex, because it combines comparison with the dimension of space and time, for instance by analyzing similar change processes of media systems in different world regions and times in history. This causes problems, because the changing systems can exhibit considerable differences between one another. Although there are differences between them, transformation processes often occur at the same time and significant similarities between the resulting patterns can be observed.Kleinsteuber (2010), p. 23-26. == Interrelation between transformation processes of political and media systems == The transformation research on media systems has its origin in transformation studies of political sciences. Fragments of political science theories were applied in comparative media studies,Kleinsteuber (2010), p. 23. since transformation processes of media systems are strongly connected to the transformation of political systems.Voltmer (2008), p. 29. Katharina Hadamik (2003) describes this connection as \\"political-medial transformation-parallelism\\". She stresses that the media system in a state cannot take any path of transformation. It is connected to the transformation of the political system. For instance, states which develop democratic structures and constitutional conditions in their political system also build out free or relatively free media systems. In contrast, media systems in states with weaker or even no transformation of the political system have much higher barriers of development to overcome.Hadamik (2004), p. 54-56. So, \\"it is the political system that ultimately has the power to make binding decisions and thus shapes the basic structure and functioning of the media system\\".Voltmer (2012), p. 240. This strong connection between political and media system can be emphasized by watching the process of transformation from an authoritarian to a democratic system in both politics and media. The transformation from an authoritarian to a democratic political system has three phases:Merkel (1999), p. 119-169. Phase 1: end of the old authoritarian regime Phase 2: transformation and institutionalisation of democracy Phase 3: consolidation of democracy through a new system The process of transformation from an authoritarian to a democratic media system also has three phases, similar to the phases of transformation in political systems:Hadamik (2004), p. 57-58. Phase 1: breakthrough in the media sector Phase 2: fixation of the changes in the media sector Phase 3: development of a stable media system == Types of transformation processes== In comparative media system research, scholars have identified three processes of change in media systems: homogenization, heterogenization, and hybridization.  Homogenization towards one model of media systems  In the field of comparative media system research, homogenization is defined as the convergence of many media systems towards one specific model, caused by changes in political and economic structures, commercialization, and changes in technology. Cultural differences between the countries are said to become less important, since a few international conglomerates dominate the global media industry. In 2004, the authors Hallin and Mancini attested a convergence of European media systems towards the Liberal Media System prevalent in North America, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Relating to the convergence of media systems, four constitutive factors can be identified:Hallin & Mancini (2004a), p. 25-41.Hallin & Mancini (2004b), p. 251-254, 294-295.Boczkowski, Mitchelstein & Walter (2011), p. 379. * Americanization: The changing organizational structures and behaviors within the media are heading towards patterns first established in the United States. Moreover, the US American model of politically neutral and professional journalism is becoming more and more influential for other media systems. The journalistic education of the United States has said to have been a strong influence on journalism cultures worldwide.Hallin & Mancini (2004a), p. 25-28.Hallin & Mancini (2004b), p. 254-259.Hardy (2008), p. 119-122. * Technological change: New technologies can lead to adaptations by individuals and social institutions, for instance assuming new communication procedures associated with the new technology. These effects often produce common practices across different social contexts. The development of professional journalism is also connected to technological change.Hallin & Mancini (2004b), p. 259-261.Hardy (2008), p. 78. * Secularization: The term secularization describes \\"the separation of citizens from attachments of religious and ideological 'faiths,' and the decline of institutions based on these faiths\\".Hallin & Mancini (2004b), p. 263. This separation results in a decline of political parties, since they are connected to ideologies and particular social milieus. Hence, secularization leads media systems towards the Liberal Model.Hallin & Mancini (2004a), p. 28-32, 34-38.Hallin & Mancini (2004b), p. 263-267. * Commercialization: Commercialization can be seen as the most important force of homogenization. It has changed the print media as well as the electronic media. The transition of European broadcasting systems, from predominantly public service systems in the 1970s to a system with commercial domination today, gave the strongest impetus for homogenization. Thus, commercialization decreases the ties of media system and political system.Hallin & Mancini (2004a), p. 38-40.Hallin & Mancini (2004b), p. 273-282. Although a tendency of homogenization towards the Liberal Model can be attested, there still are important differences between the systems. First of all, the variations between the political systems of each country seem to persist in the future. Furthermore, the party and electoral systems between the countries remain different. Moreover, the legal systems of the countries are still distinct. Also, even though there is a trend towards neutral journalism, political parallelism in the national press of Democratic Corporatist countries still persists and will probably remain in the immediate future. Thus, a complete converge of the media systems seems unlikely.Hallin & Mancini (2004b), p. 282-287, 301.Boczkowski, Mitchelstein & Walter (2011), p. 380.Hardy (2008), p. 121. There are also limits and countertendencies against homogenization. There is evidence of countertendencies relating to the reduction of political polarization and ideological differences between parties. In some countries, new extremist parties on the far right of the political spectrum arose, motivated through issues of immigration, multiculturalism and integration. Moreover, so called advocacy journalism does not only persist in Polarized Pluralist countries (especially in Italy, Spain and Greece), but new forms of it are also beginning to proliferate in all kinds of media systems.Hallin & Mancini (2004b), p. 284-285, 301.  Heterogenization of media systems  Some scholars argue against the theory of homogenization of media systems that due to national political cultures and institutions, a process of heterogenization rather than homogenization, has to be stated.Boczkowski, Mitchelstein & Walter (2011), p. 377. The countertendencies of homogenization (for instance new right extremist parties, new forms of advocacy journalism, divergence processes in the styles of election coverage between the United States and Great Britain) lead to heterogenization of the media systems.Hallin & Mancini (2004b), p. 284-285. However, the divergence of media systems is confronted by a much more fundamental convergence between them.Boczkowski, Mitchelstein & Walter (2011), p. 389. Hallin & Mancini also argue that the results of their analysis do not support the thesis of heterogenization of media systems.Hallin & Mancini (2004b), p. 86.  Hybridization of media systems  Hybrid media systems are defined as a blend of already existing practices and new practices from a new or foreign media system. Foreign models are adapted to the particular historical, geographical, social, and cultural characteristics of the domestic media system.de Albuquerque (2012), p. 89.Hadamik (2004), p. 55.Coman (2000), p. 54. Rather than a temporary state of transformation, hybrid media systems are considered an equilibrium between two types of practices. Thus, hybrid media systems are mostly located between authoritarian and democratic political systems. Although they may have introduced competitive elections, they may not strengthen further democratic institutions beyond the basic requirements. Therefore, the degree to which hybrid systems adopt democratic practices can vary from state to state. Hybrid systems build out distinct patterns of politic-media relations with significant differences to Western media systems,Voltmer (2012), p. 231-245.Roudakova (2012), p. 247. for instance the Brazilian media system, which was influenced by the American journalism model. However, the American journalism system was not adopted one- to-one, since there \\"was no solid market economy, individualistic culture, or political culture that valued the freedom of press\\".de Albuquerque (2012), p. 82. Another example is the media system of Poland, which detached itself from its communist ties in the 1990s and converged towards Western media systems, but still has its Polish specifics, such as the use of public-service broadcasting as a political instrument.Hadamik (2004), p. 324. According to the three phases from an authoritarian to a democratic media system, the old authoritarian system ends by the institutionalisation of democratic elements (phase 1 and 2). In the third phase, the new hybrid system consolidates democratic elements, but some elements of the authoritarian system still exist. Thus, it is difficult to state when the third phase is completed. In Hallin & Mancini's Comparing media systems beyond the western world (2012), which gives an overview of criticism about their framework of 2004 and furthermore extends and revises it, Katrin Voltmer states that, instead of media system homogenization towards the Liberal Model of Hallin & Mancini's framework, transformation processes rather move towards hybrid media systems, since media markets become more international, but have to adapt to local situations. Thus, the theory of hybridization in media systems is rather an adaption than a counterpart to the theory of convergence.Voltmer (2012), p. 231. == Outlook == A consistent transformation theory valid for all transformation processes and countries, does not yet exist, since it is difficult to cover the variety and complexity of all the processes. Some researchers are of the opinion that it is impossible to find a consistent theory of transformation processes, because of the historical, political and social particularities of each country and their different types of transformation processes.Hadamik (2004), p. 23. Furthermore, the debate about convergence, divergence, or hybridization of media systems is still ongoing.Boczkowski, Mitchelstein & Walter (2011), p. 377, 385-391. == References == * * * de Albuquerque, A.

Standing at the back are eight men, some bearded, wearing hats and coats, and three men in sports clothing. In front of the men is a large trophy in the form of a shield. Birmingham City Football Club, an English association football club based in the city of Birmingham, was founded in 1875 as Small Heath Alliance. For their first thirteen years, there was no league football, so matches were arranged on an occasional basis, supplemented by cup competitions organised at both local and national level. In 1888, Small Heath joined the Combination, a league set up to provide organised football for those clubs not invited to join the Football League which was to start the same year. However, the Combination was not well organised, and folded in April 1889 with many fixtures still outstanding. Small Heath were founder members of the Football Alliance in 1889, and three years later were elected to the newly formed Second Division of the Football League. They topped the table in their first season, though failed to win promotion via the test match system then in operation, but reached the top flight for the first time in 1894. Since that time, they have not fallen below the third tier of the English football league system, and were promoted to the Premier League for the first time for the 2002‚Äì03 season. Birmingham's first team have competed in a number of nationally contested leagues, and their record against each club faced in those competitions is summarised below. The opening match of the 1889‚Äì90 Football Alliance season pitted them against near neighbours Birmingham St George's, their first Football League match was against Burslem Port Vale, and they met their 109th and most recent different league opponent, Burton Albion, for the first time in the 2016‚Äì17 EFL Championship season. The team that Birmingham have played most in league competition is Manchester City, whom they first met as Ardwick in the 1891‚Äì92 Football Alliance season. Wolverhampton Wanderers have beaten Birmingham 62 times in the league, more than any other team: they overtook Manchester City's total of 60 victories in the 2017‚Äì18 EFL Championship season. Derby County and Everton have each drawn 35 league encounters with Birmingham, more than any other club. Birmingham have recorded more league victories against Leicester City than against any other club, having beaten them 50 times out of 124 attempts. All statistics are correct up to and including the match played against Norwich City on 20 October 2020. ==Key== *The table includes results of matches played by Birmingham City (under that name and under former names Birmingham and Small Heath) in the Football Alliance, the Football League and the Premier League.

He is known for his research in particle physics, where he wrote the standard textbook Anomalies in Quantum Field Theory, and in the field of Bell inequalities, in particular from the quantum comparison Bertlmann‚Äôs Socks of John Bell. Reinhold Bertlmann, 2010 == Education and career == Bertlmann studied technical physics at the Technical University Vienna and Theoretical Physics at the University of Vienna, where he received his Ph.D. degree. He worked as a scientist in Vienna, at the JINR in Dubna and at CERN. After his Habilitation in Theoretical Physics in Vienna 1981 about Duality between resonances and asymptotia, he held visiting professorships in Marseille, at the University Paris-Sud and at the CNRS. From 1987 until his retirement in 2010 he was university professor at the University of Vienna, where he is still lecturing. Reinhold Bertlmann has been married to the artist Renate Bertlmann since 1969. == Physics == Bertlmann works in quantum physics; in particular he is occupied with Bell inequalities, entanglement, decoherence and geometry of quantum systems. In addition he is concerned with anomalies in quantum field theory. Bertlmann was a close friend and collaborator of the late John Stewart Bell and worked together with Walter Thirring. Presently, he collaborates with Anton Zeilinger, with whom he organized the celebrated quantum conferences Quantum [Un]Speakables I in 2000 and Quantum [Un]Speakables II in 2014. The resulting collections of the 2000 essays, under the same title Quantum [Un]Speakables, has become seminal for the field. == Bertlmann‚Äôs socks == Reinhold Bertlmann showing his socks, Vienna, 30 Aug 2007 In 1978 Bertlmann went to CERN, where he worked together with J. S. Bell. Bertlmann always wore socks of different colours. In 1981 Bell wrote the article \\"Bertlmann‚Äôs socks and the nature of reality\\", where he compared the EPR paradox with Bertlmann‚Äôs socks: if you observe one sock to be pink you can predict with certainty that the other sock is not pink. Thus you might assume that quantum entanglement is just the same. However, this is a non-admissible simplification, and Bell in his article explains why. Bell‚Äôs article is reprinted in his book Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics and is discussed in the books of Andrew Whitaker The New Quantum Age, Louisa Gilder's The Age of Entanglement and Nature loves to hide by Shimon Malin. In 2015, Bertlmann wrote a lengthy piece \\"Bell's Universe: A Personal Recollection\\",Bell's Universe: A Personal Recollection (My collaboration and friendship with John Bell is recollected.), Reinhold Bertlmann, 25 May 2016, accessed 27 May 2016 explaining in some detail his amazement at finding out about Bell's paper on the socks. == Literature == *J.S.

ELISAD's tasks were: * To stimulate and enhance European cooperation between libraries, information services, documentation centres and individuals working in the field of addictions. * To stimulate the use and the development of information management technologies. * To promote the role of libraries and documentation centres as important means for communicating research findings to different audiences.European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (October 2008).

ELISAD organises an annual conference each year on topics relevant to information, research and documentation and addictions. It provides a mailing list for members to exchange information about new books, meetings and other resources. ==History== Following meetings in 1988 Lyon, France and 1989 Stockholm, Sweden of European librarians, documentalists and information professionals working in drugs, alcohol, and tobacco, it was recognised that there was a need to set up an association to enable the exchange of experiences, skills and knowledge. Annual meetings were felt to be a way of meeting this need, with the formal establishment of Elisad in 1990.Posters presenting Elisad‚Äôs 20 years history, 2008 Jasper Woodcock, Head of the Institute for the Study of Drug Dependence, UK ‚Äì that became DrugScope in 2000 ‚Äì was elected as Elisad‚Äôs first President.In DrugLink (Nov./Dec. 1992) p. 4 Many existing library associations were models and encouraged the Elisad foundation: * SALIS (Substance Abuse Librarians and Information Specialists), Elisad‚Äôs sister organisation in North America * EAHIL (European Association for Health Information and Libraries) * IFLA (International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions) * ALA (American Library Association) * ASIST (American Society for Information Science and Technology) Over the years the annual conferences have covered many subjects. In 1999, at the annual ELISAD meeting at the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) in Lisbon, presentations focused on the growth of information about addictions on the World Wide Web and raised concerns about the quality and accuracy of such resources. Presenters also found that their searches were producing thousands of results because addictions encompasses various research disciplines, including health, social sciences, medicine, law, politics, psychology, neurosciences, toxicology, and so onGoodair, Christine; Moen, Jorunn; Prepeliczay, Susanna; & Rouault Thomas (2005). ‚ÄúCollaboration across Europe: Experience from practice‚Äù.

The offered sensor data comprises of sensors themselves, which are encoded in the Sensor Model Language (SensorML), and the measured values in the Observations and Measurements (O & M) encoding format. The web service as well as both file formats are open standards and specifications of the same name defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). If the SOS supports the transactional profile (SOS-T), new sensors can be registered on the service interface and measuring values be inserted. A SOS implementation can be used both for data from in-situ as well as remote sensing sensors. Furthermore, the sensors can be either mobile or stationary. Since 2007,http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=26667 the SOS is an official OGC standard. The advantage of the SOS is that sensor data - of any kind - is available in a standardized format using standardized operations. Thus the web-based access to sensor data is simplified. It also allows easy integration into existing Spatial Data Infrastructures or Geographic Information Systems. In 2016 OGC approved the SensorThings API standard specification, a new RESTful and JSON-based standard provide functions similar to SOS. As both SensorThings API and SOS are based on the OGC/ISO 19156:2011, the two specifications have been demonstrated in an OGC IoT pilot that they can interoperate with each other.http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/initiatives/imisiot == Operations == The SOS has three so-called core operations that must be provided by each implementation. The GetCapabilities operation allows you to query a service for a description of the service interface and the available sensor data. For using the SOS, the GetObservation function is probably the most important. It can be utilized to retrieve data for specific sensors. The DescribeSensor function returns detailed information about a sensor or a sensor system and the producing processes.  Core operations (core profile)  * GetCapabilities returns an XML service description with information about the interface (offered operations and endpoints) as well as the available sensor data, such as the period for which sensor data is available, sensors that produce the measured values, or phenomena that are observed (for example air temperature). * GetObservation allows pull-based querying of observed values, including their metadata. The measured values and their metadata is returned in the Observations and Measurements format (O & M). * DescribeSensor - provides sensor metadata in SensorML. The sensor description can contain information about the sensor in general, the identifier and classification, position and observed phenomena, but also details such as calibration data.  Transactional operations (transactional profile)  * RegisterSensor allows to register a new sensor in an deployed SOS. * InsertObservation can be used to insert data for already registered sensors in the SOS.  Extended operations (enhanced profile)  * GetResult provides the ability to query for sensor readings without the metadata given consistent metadata (e.g. sensor, observed object). * GetFeatureOfInterest returns the geoobject whose properties are monitored by sensors in Geography Markup Language encoding. * GetFeatureOfInterestTime provides time periods in which measurements of an observed object in the SOS are available. * DescribeFeatureType returns the type of the observed geoobjects (XML Schema) * DescribeObservationType returns the type of observation (XML Schema), such as om: Measurement). * GetObservationById allows to query a specific observation using an identifier returned by the service as response to an InsertObservation operation. * DescribeResultModel provides the XML Schema of the measured value, which is particularly important for complex measurements, such as multi-spectral data. == Terminology == The OGC has - not only for the SOS - its own well-defined terminology. For better understanding, here are some important terms: {  - ! Term !! Description -  Feature of interest (FOI)  The ~ represents the geoobject who is subject to the measured values and is measured by sensors. The FOI is usually the means of locating (geocoding) the measuring points, i.e. the geoobject has coordinates (for example latitude, longitude and altitude). It depends very much on the project and must be chosen depending on the task at hand. -  Observation  An ~ gives a measurement (result) for the property (Phenomenon) of an object under observation (FOI). The value itself is generated by a sensor or by procedures (procedure). Furthermore, the phenomenon was detected at a particular time (sampling time) and generated the value at a particular time (Result Time). Often these two time values are consistent, so in practice the sampling time is used as the time of observation. -  Offering  An ~ is a logical grouping of observations that are related to each other, which are jointly offered by a service. -  Phenomenon A ~ is a property (physical quantity) of a geoobject. Examples are air temperature, wind velocity, pollutant concentration of the atmosphere, reflected radiation in certain frequency band, et cetera. -  Procedure  A ~ produces the measured value of an observation. This can be done by reading a sensor, or a numerical simulation process. -  In situ  ~ is the Latin term for \\"on the spot.\\" } == Software == The SOS is a standard of the OGC and ultimately only defines a service interface, but not an implementation. There are currently several Open Source implementations of the service: * Java SOS implementation by 52¬∞Northhttp://52north.org/communities/sensorweb/sos/ * Java SOS implementation within the deegree framework by the company lat/lonhttp://www.deegree.org/ * A C implementation of SOS in MapServer * Java, Perl and Python implementations by the project OOSTethyshttp://www.oostethys.org/downloads * A Python implementation as istSOShttp://istsos.org/ Also, proprietary implementations exist.http://www.opengeospatial.org/resource/products/byspec == References  External links == * OpenGIS Sensor Observation Service on the OGC website Category:Wireless sensor network Category:Geographic information systems Category:Open Geospatial Consortium Category:Web services Category:Open standards ","title":"Sensor Observation Service"},{"id":"35236654","text":"Bertha Mason in the foreground, an illustration by F.

Retrieved 29 April 2018.) is a fictional character in Charlotte Bront√´'s 1847 novel Jane Eyre. She is described as the violently insane first wife of Edward Rochester, who moved her to Thornfield Hall and locked her in a room on the third floor.Jane Eyre (\\"I lingered in the long passage‚Ä¶\\") at Project Gutenberg. Retrieved 29 April 2018. The 1966 parallel novel Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys serves as a prequel to Bront√´'s novel. It is the story of Mason (there called Antoinette Cosway) from the time of her youth in the Caribbean to her unhappy marriage and relocation to England. Rhys's novel re-imagines Bront√´'s devilish madwoman in the attic. Bertha serves as Jane's \\"double\\", juxtaposing the feminist character to a character constrained by domesticity. == In Jane Eyre == Bertha Mason is the only daughter of a very wealthy family living in Spanish Town, Jamaica. The reader learns of her past not from her perspective but only through the description of her unhappy husband, Edward Rochester. She is described as being of Creole heritage. According to Rochester, Bertha was famous for her beauty: she was the pride of the town and sought after by many suitors. Upon leaving college, Rochester was persuaded by his father to visit the Mason family and court Bertha. As he tells it, he first meets her at a ball she attended with her father and brother Richard, where he was entranced by her loveliness. Despite never being alone with her, and supposedly having had scarcely any interaction or conversation with her, he married her for her wealth and beauty, and with fierce encouragement from his own father and the Mason family. Rochester and Bertha began their lives as husband and wife in Jamaica. In recounting the history of their relationship, Rochester claims, > I thought I loved her. ... Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued > me; she allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I > was. Oh, I have no respect for myself when I think of that act! ... I never > loved, I never esteemed, I did not even know her.Jane Eyre (\\"Well, Jane, > being so...\\") at Project Gutenberg. Retrieved 8 January 2013. Rochester explains that he was not warned that violent insanity and intellectual disability ran in the Mason family and that the past three generations succumbed to it. He assumed Bertha's mother to be dead and was never told otherwise, but she was locked away in an asylum. Bertha also had an intellectually disabled younger brother. Rochester's father knew of this but did not bother to tell his son, caring only about the vast fortune the marriage would bring him, and the Mason family clearly wanted Bertha off their hands as quickly as possible. Rochester asserts that Bertha's mental health deteriorated quickly, though it is unclear which form of mental illness she suffers from. Her insane, violent behaviour becomes frightening to behold. Her laughter is described as \\"demonic\\", she crawls on all fours, snarling, and behaving in a bestial manner.Jane Eyre (\\"My bride‚Äôs mother I had never seen...\\") at Project Gutenberg. Retrieved 8 January 2013. Rochester returns with her to England and has her imprisoned in a third-floor room off the gallery of his house for ten years with Grace Poole, a hired nurse who keeps her under control. Rochester travels abroad to forget his horrible marriage. However, Grace drinks sometimes, and Bertha manages to escape, causing havoc in the house: starting a fire in Mr Rochester's bed and biting and stabbing her visiting brother.Jane Eyre (\\"To England, then...\\") at Project Gutenberg. Retrieved 8 January 2013. Rochester's marriage to Bertha eventually stands in the way of his marrying Jane Eyre, who is unaware of Bertha's existence and whom he truly loves. (He later admits to Jane that he once thought he loved Bertha). As Bertha is insane he cannot divorce her, due to her actions being uncontrollable and thus not legitimate grounds for divorce. Years of violence, insanity, and confinement in an attic destroy Bertha's looks: when she sees Bertha in the middle of the night, Jane describes Bertha as looking \\"savage\\", even going so far as to compare her with a \\"German vampire\\".Jane Eyre (\\"Of the foul German spectre‚Äîthe Vampyre.\\") at Project Gutenberg. Retrieved 8 January 2013. Bertha destroys Jane's wedding veil (an action that hints that Bertha is at least sane enough to be aware that her husband is planning to enter a bigamous marriage). Despite not loving her, Rochester attempts to save Bertha from a fire she starts in the house when she again escapes. Bertha dies after throwing herself off the roof, leaving her husband free to marry Jane. Though her race is never mentioned, it is sometimes conjectured that she was of mixed race. Rochester suggests that Bertha's parents wanted her to marry him, because he was of \\"good race\\", implying that she was not pure white, while he was. There are also references to her \\"dark\\" hair, and \\"discoloured\\" and \\"black\\" face.

The book purports to tell Antoinette's side of the story, as well as Rochester's, and to account for how she ended up alone and raving in the attic of Thornfield Hall. According to the book, Antoinette's insanity and drunkenness are the result of Rochester's misguided belief that madness is in her blood and that she was part of the scheme to have him married blindly. The characters of Jane Eyre and Antoinette are portrayed as being very similar; independent, vivacious, imaginative young women with troubled childhoods, educated in religious establishments and looked down on by the upper classes‚Äîand, of course, they both marry Mr Rochester. However, Antoinette is more rebellious than Jane and less mentally stable. She displays a deep vein of morbidity verging on a death-wish and, in contrast with Jane's overt Christianity, holds a cynical viewpoint of both God and religion in general. == References  External links == *Analysis of Bertha Mason at the British Library Category:Jane Eyre Category:Literary characters introduced in 1847 Category:Drama film characters Category:Fictional gentry Category:Spanish Town Category:Fictional suicides Category:Fictional Jamaican people Category:Fictional characters with neurological or psychological disorders Category:Female characters in literature ","title":"Bertha Mason"},{"id":"35236679","text":"Purpura haemorrhagica is a rare complication of equine strangles and is caused by bleeding from capillaries which results in red spots on the skin and mucous membranes together with oedema (swelling) of the limbs and the head. Purpura hemorrhagica is more common in younger animals. ==Pathophysiology== Horses that develop purpura hemorrhagica usually have a recent history of strangles (infection with Streptococcus equi subsp. equi) or vaccination (intramuscular or intranasal) for strangles. It is thought to be caused by an auto-immune reaction where antibodies against the S. equi M- or R-protein cross-react with proteins on endothelial cells. This results in vasculitis, leading to subsequent severe peripheral edema in the legs and ventral abdomen, as well as petechiation or ecchymoses over the mucous membranes. Purpura hemorrhagica can also rarely be seen after infection with S. equi subsp.zooepidemicus, Rhodococcus equi, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (causative agent of pigeon fever), equine influenza virus, or equine herpes virus type 1, or without any apparent infection. ==Clinical signs== The most common clinical sign is subcutaneous edema of the limbs and hemorrhages on mucous membranes. Other clinical signs include depression, anorexia, fever, elevated heart and respiratory rate, reluctance to move, drainage from lymph nodes, exudation of serum from the skin, colic, epistaxis and weight loss. Rarely, horses may also develop disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), leading to infarction of various organs, or chronic myositis and muscle atrophy. ==Treatment== Treatment usually involves high doses of steroids such as dexamethasone. While high doses of steroids may risk laminitis, low doses are associated with refractory cases. Antibiotics are used to treat any residual nidus of S. equi. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as phenylbutazone or flunixin, may be useful to reduce fever and relieve pain. Intravenous DMSO is sometimes used as a free-radical scavenger and anti-inflammatory. Additionally, wrapping the legs may reduce edema and skin sloughing. Supportive care with oral or IV fluids may also be required. ==Prognosis== Prognosis is good with early, aggressive treatment (92% survival in one study). ==Prevention== Purpura hemorrhagica may be prevented by proper management during an outbreak of strangles. This includes isolation of infected horses, disinfection of fomites, and good hygiene by caretakers. Affected horses should be isolated at least one month following infection. Exposed horses should have their temperature taken daily and should be quarantined if it becomes elevated. Prophylactic antimicrobial treatment is not recommended. Vaccination can reduce the incidence and severity of the disease. However, horses with high SeM antibody titers are more likely to develop purpura hemorrhagica following vaccination and so these horses should not be vaccinated. Titers may be measured by ELISA. ==See also== * Purpura - in humans ==References== Category:Horse diseases ","title":"Purpura haemorrhagica"},{"id":"35236685","text":"The Sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly opened on 18 September 2012 and having its last scheduled meeting on 11 September 2013. The President of the United Nations General Assembly was chosen from the EEG (the smallest regional grouping) with Serbia's then foreign minister Vuk Jeremiƒá beating out Lithuania's Dalius ƒåekuolis in an election. Notably, the session led to United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19 which granted Palestine non-member observer state status. ==Organisation for the session== On 23 June 2011, Serbia's Vuk Jeremiƒá was elected president of the United Nations General Assembly after beating Lithuania's Dalius ƒåekuolis in an election. This was the turn of the Eastern European Group to preside over the General Assembly. He also said that the session would prioritise what he characterised as 'issues of great concern, including the promotion of sustainable development and the maintenance unity amongst UN member states.' In his acceptance speech, he said: > I hope that our joint endeavours may help to bring us closer to the day when > humankind shall have assuaged its hurts and abolished its fears; and, in so > doing, to further the aspirations of the peoples of the United Nations to > save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. May it be the will of > God that the next session of the General Assembly goes down in history as > one of peace. As is tradition during each session of the General Assembly, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon drew lots to see which member state would take the helm at the first seat in the General Assembly Chamber. On 8 June 2012, Jamaica was chosen to lead the chamber, while the other member states would follow according to the English translation of their name, the same order would be followed in the six main committees. The Chairmen and officers of the six Main Committees were also elected: First Committee (Disarmament and International Security Committee) ;Second Committee (Economic and Financial Committee) ; Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee) ; Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonization Committee) ; Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary Committee) ; and the Sixth Committee (Legal Committee) . The nineteen vice-presidents of the UNGA also elected were from: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Lebanon, Nepal (Asian group), Algeria, Angola, Congo, Ghana, Sierra Leone (African group), Russia (Eastern European group), Honduras, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago (Latin American and Caribbea group), France, Israel, Netherlands, Palau, United Kingdom and the United States of America (Western European and Others group). An additional African member would be elected at a later date. ==Opening schedule== The opening session of the 67th UNGA includes: *18 September 2012: At 15:00, the session was officially opened. *24 September: A high-level meeting took place in regards to the rule of law. *25 September: From 10:00 onwards the annual General Debate will begin and continue for about a week. President Vuk Jeremic said at the opening of the session: \\"Peace and security is a prerequisite for the stability needed for global economic growth, sustainable development and social progress. Our objective should be the full implementation of the mandate this body received at the Rio+20 Conference. This will require a decisive commitment to observe not only procedural deadlines but also the political and financial objectives it has been designed to accomplish.\\" He also said the main theme of the session would be the peaceful settlement of international disputes: \\"I hope this framework will usefully serve the noble cause of preventing gathering conflicts and resolving existing ones.\\" As well as maintaining the rule of law: \\"Close to 800 years after the Magna Carta was promulgated, many people around the world still do not enjoy the fundamental rights enshrined in that seminal document ‚Äì rights that protect individuals, while enabling countries to develop in peace and security, as sovereign equals. I urge the Member States to agree on a consensus document by the start of the High-Level Debate on the Rule of Law in a few days‚Äô time.\\" Other important goals for the session are: peace and security as a means of enhancing development, a focus before te Millennium Development Goals' deadline in 2015, achieving the commitments made at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Brazil in June, progress on arms control and disarmament, strengthening UN peacekeeping operations, coordinating global responses to non-state terrorism and the promotion of human rights. He was also congratulated by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who said of the session ahead: \\"We are living through a period of unease. These are times of rising unemployment, rising inequality, rising temperatures ‚Äì and rising intolerance. The United Nations must rise to the moment.\\" General Debate Most states will have a representative speaking about issues concerning their country and the hopes for the coming year as to what the UNGA will do. This is as opportunity for the member states to opine on international issues of their concern. The General Debate will commence with the opening of the session on 25 September and continue until 1 October. The order of speakers is given first to member states, then observer states and supranational bodies. Any other observers entities will have a chance to speak at the end of the debate, if they so choose. Speakers will be put on the list in the order of their request, with special consideration for ministers and other government officials of similar or higher rank. According to the rules in place for the General Debate, the statements should be in one of the United Nations official languages of Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian or Spanish, and will be translated by the United Nations translators. Each speaker is requested to provide 20 advance copies of their statements to the conference officers to facilitate translation and to be presented at the podium. Speeches are requested to be limited to five minutes, with seven minutes for supranational bodies. President Vuk Jeremic chose the theme: \\"Adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations by peaceful means.\\" ==Agenda== A multitude of issues, including administrative affairs for the UN, are on the broader preliminary agenda for the session. There is also a day-by-day schedule. A high level meeting on the rule of law took place on 24 September. President Vuk Jeremic also constituted a three-person panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda in regards to the encroaching deadline to meet the Millennium Development Goals. The three-members are: Indonesia's Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Liberia's Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and the United Kingdom's David Cameron. Issues It had been speculated by the Middle Eastern media that the Iranian nuclear programme, along with the Syrian civil war, would constitute the main focus of the session. A few days before the session began, international leaders arrived for the General Debate amongst worry that these two issues would lead to a wider international conflict. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that the United States, United Kingdom and France \\"violate the basic rights and freedoms of other nations\\" and called Israelis \\"uncultured Zionists.\\" In addition, U.N. and Arab League envoy for Syria Lakhdar Brahimi warned the Security Council that the Syrian civil war was worsening, but Russia and China still used their veto power to in opposition to international intervention in Syria. Similar to the previous year, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas vowed to take up the issue of Palestinian membership in some form on 27 September at the General Debate, as part of a campaign the Western media viewed as an attempt to gain the international community's attention. However, Abbas did not call for formally putting the issue to a vote. The move followed days of Palestinian protests directed against the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank cities of Bethlehem, Nablus and Hebron. However, unlike the previous year, where Abbas sought full-member status, he will symbolically seek non-member status. At the same time, the Palestinian delegation will be half the size of that of the previous year. Following Operation Pillar of Defense, the Palestinians promised to seek a vote on an upgrade in status to non-member observer state in the UN General Assembly on 29 November, the symbolic date the UN chose voted on the Partition Plan in 1947, leading to the founding of Israel, and the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. On 29 November, the UNGA voted on the issue. The resumed part of the GA's 67th Session also include several thematic public debates. One of them is the thematic debate on the role of international criminal justice in reconciliation. After a meeting with session President Vuk Jeremic, South Africa's Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Maite Nkoana- Mashabane called for at least two permanent seats on the UNSC saying: \\"We agree with all member states that change cannot be if it (UN) continues to ignore and exclude the 54-member African Union (AU). We have taken a very clear position that there will be no change without us because 70 percent of the issues taken to the UNSC and are tabled for discussion are about us.\\" Jeremic responded that \\"a fair representation of African states in the UNSC is needed. The current composition of the UNSC does not reflect the realities of the 21th century. If the institution does not keep up with the times and environment, the UNSC will become slowly but surely irrelevant.\\" ==Resolutions== Resolutions have come before the UNGA between 3 October 2012 and summer 2013. United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19 granted Palestine non-member observer state status. ==Elections== The election of non- permanent members to the Security Council for 2013‚Äì2014 was held in October 2012. Outgoing members were Colombia, Germany, India, Portugal and South Africa. An election to choose 18 members of the United Nations Human Rights Council for a three-year term took place from 12‚Äì18 November. The outgoing members were: Cameroon, Djibouti, Mauritius, Nigeria and Senegal (African group); Bangladesh, China, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan and Saudi Arabia (Asian group); Hungary and Russia (Eastern European group); Cuba, Mexico and Uruguay (Latin American and Caribbean group); and Belgium, Norway and the United States (Western Europe and Others group).

There, Jo-goo meets and engages in a game of hide-and-seek with a ghost child, which then scares the bejesus out of him later that night. As the two of them spend more time together, developing a fast friendship, Yeo-ri confesses the long story behind her gray, wan face.

Each man cave is custom-designed for the recipient based on his hobbies and likes. The rooms are then renovated to include a media center, minibar, and a lounge among other elements. Previous themes included hockey, surfing, car racing, skiing, golfing, rock-n-roll, and others. During the renovation, the hosts offer ideas and do-it-yourself instruction to help homeowners construct their own personal hangouts. At the end of each episode, the newly renovated \\"man cave\\" is revealed to the recipient, who did not see the room during its transformation. ==Notable renovations== There have been several notable renovations that included celebrities or famous places. Man caves have been created for Food Network personalities Michael Symon and Duff Goldman. The episode involving Goldman was also filmed as part of the Season 8 premiere of his show Ace of Cakes, entitled \\"Man Caves\\". Siragusa and Cameron both appeared on this cross-over episode. The season 10 premiere on January 26, 2012 featured the creation of a man cave for NBA player Kris Humphries in his Lake Minnetonka home fresh off his highly publicized divorce from Kim Kardashian just 3 months prior, creating media attention as the renovation was seen as the start of Humphries' newly single lifestyle. Other celebrities that have appeared include Snoop Dogg, Artie Lange, Gary Dell'Abate, Rainn Wilson, Jimmie Johnson, Dan Patrick, A. J. Calloway, Bert Kreischer, Charles Kelly of Lady Antebellum and Charlie Sheen. The crew built a man cave for the United Service Organization at Camp Virginia in Kuwait, revamping one of the tents. A NASCAR-themed man cave was created at Bristol Motor Speedway for the NASCAR race weekend 2012. The setting of the show's 100th episode was at Madame Tussauds in New York, where a man cave was built as the background set for host Siragusa's own wax figure. The actual building of the man cave was done for live public viewing in Times Square in April 2011.

His Latin name Ludovicus Sanctus (sometimes rendered as Santus) means Louis the Saint and is a literal translation of the Dutch name Lodewijk Heyligen. ==Biography== Very little is known about the early life of Lodewijk Heyligen. It is believed he was born in Beringen. Beringen was located in the archdeaconry of Campine (in Dutch: Aartsdiakonaat Kempenland) which in turn was part of the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. This is at the origin of Lodewijk's alternative name of Louis van Campen. After studies at the Latin College in Beringen, he studied music at the abbey school of St. Laurent in Li√®ge. After taking holy orders he traveled to the papal court in Avignon where he became linked to Cardinal Giovanni Colonna. He first became a cantor and later secretary to Colonna and was also the master of music at the Chapel of Colonna. He was further appointed cantor of the St. Donatian's Cathedral in Bruges in 1342. In a letter to the chapter of the St. Donatian's Cathedral dated 27 April 1348 the content of which has been partially preserved, Lodewijk Heyligen describes the horrors of the plague that was then raging in Europe. He ascribes the origin of the plague to calamitous events in India and the arrival in Genoa and later Marseille of merchant ships coming from the Orient. The letter recounts that half of the population of Avignon had died of the disease and that 11,000 of them had been buried in a new cemetery.Welkenhuysen, A. 1988 La Peste en Avignon (1348) D√©crite par un T√©moin Oculaire, Louis Sanctus de B√©ringen. [Edition Critique, Traduction, El√©ments de Commentaire]. In: R. Lievens, et al., eds. Pascua Mediaevalia: Studies voor Prof. Dr. J. M. de Smet. 1983. Louvain: Universitaire Pers, pp. 452‚Äì492 After his master Colonna died from the plague in 1348 he remained principally in Avignon where he died in 1361. ==Music theorist== He is probably the author of two treatises on music formerly attributed to Louis of Toulouse (1274‚Äì1297), De musicae commendacione (which is lost) and the Sentencia in musica sonora subiecti (which still exists). The latter treatise is structured as a scholastic investigation into the essence of music, to which he refers as musica sonora. He concludes that the essence of music is found primarily in the relation between number and sound, secondly in the relation of one sound to another and finally‚Äîbased on the first two categories‚Äîin the determination of properties, emotions and modulations. ==Friend of Petrarch== Only in 1904 was it established with certainty on the basis of documents from the Vatican that the person to whom Petrarch in his writings referred as 'Socrates' was in fact Lodewijk Heyligen. Their relationship can be traced back to the year 1330, when Petrarch was visiting bishop Giacomo Colonna in Lombez. There he became acquainted with Giacomo's brother cardinal Giovanni Colonna and his entourage of which Lodewijk Heyligen formed a part. They had the same age and became very close. Petrarch wrote about 20 letters to Lodewijk which have been preserved. Petrarch alludes in his letters to the curious fact that Socrates is the only one of his good friends, who was not given to him by Italy, but instead by the Campine (Kempen). However, the letter continues, Socrates through his temperament, and especially his friendship with Petrarch himself, had almost become Italian himself.Sur le Socrate de P√©trarque. Le musicien flamand Ludovicus sanctus de Beeringhen, Henry Cochin, in: M√©langes d'arch√©ologie et d'histoire, year 1918, Volume 37, Issue 37, pp. 3‚Äì32 Petrarch refers to Lodewijk Heyligen as a very learned man, who was also distinguished by his musical gifts. Petrarch praises him for his elevated character and his loyal friendship. It is possible that Lodewijk Heyligen inspired in Petrarch the desire to visit the Southern Netherlands (present-day Belgium), a trip that the two friends may have taken together. In his letters to Lodewijk Heyligen, Petrarch often discloses his inner feelings. None of the letters that Lodewijk Heyligen wrote to Petrarch have been preserved. Yet it was through a letter from Lodewijk Heyligen that Petrarch received the news of the death of his beloved Laura, the muse of Petrarch's poetry. Lodewijk may have been present when she died. In the letter to which Petrarcha refers, Lodewijk assured Petrarch that when Laura died angels took her soul up into heaven. At Lodewijk's instance Petrarch edited a collection of his letters. Petrarch dedicated the collection entitled Epistolae de rebus familiaribus (Familiar Letters) to his friend referred to as Socrates. The death of Lodewijk Heyligen in 1361 affected Petrarch painfully. A note in his Virgil-codex reveals his sadness upon receiving the news of his death: \\"Amisi comitem ac solatium meae vitae\\" (I have lost my comrade and the solace of my life!). Petrarch also called up the memory of his friend in a passage in the Trionfo d'Amore (Triumph of Love, from Triumphs) where he recognizes Socrates and Lelio (the literary nickname of Stefano Romano, a mutual friend of Petrarch and Lodewijk) amid the crowd, which is carried behind the chariot of Cupid: { !In the original language: ! !In English translation: -  Poco era fuor de la comune strada, quando Socrate e Lelio vidi in prima: con lor pi√π lunga via conven ch'io vada. O qual coppia d'amici! che n√© 'n rima poria n√© 'n prosa ornar assai n√© 'n versi, se, come dee, virt√π nuda si stima. Con questi duo cercai monti diversi, andando tutti tre sempre ad un giogo; a questi le mie piaghe tutte apersi; da costor non mi p√≤ tempo n√© luogo divider mai, siccome io spero e bramo, infino al cener del funereo rogo; con costor colsi 'l glor√Øoso ramo, onde forse anzi tempo ornai le tempie in memoria di quella ch'io tanto amo.   Not far from the common path had I yet moved When first I saw my Socrates, and with him My Laelius: with them I still move on. Oh what a pair of friends! Never could I In verse or prose tell rightly of their worth If at its due pure virtue be esteemed. With these twain I have travelled many lands, A common yoke holding us close together: To them I told the tale of all my wounds. Nor time nor distance e'er shall separate Us from each other‚Äîso I hope and pray Until for us the funeral pyres be lit. With them I plucked the glorious laurel branch Wherewith‚Äîperhaps too soon‚ÄîI decked my brow, Remembering her whom I so deeply love. } These words speak convincingly of the intimate friendship that Petrarch felt for Lodewijk. ==External links== * Ludovicus Sanctus, musicologie.org * Sur le Socrate de P√©trarque.

After a few years of successful results in his native region, Gadag, Karnataka, India , he quit his job to focus on working in the field of rainwater harvesting. It was in 2004 when he earned the Ashoka fellowship for his work on water conservation. One year later, with the support of Ashoka: Innovators for the Public, he started Water Literacy Foundation, located in Bangalore, India. To obtain a change in India by 2020, the NGO is working to support farmers by giving them knowledge about non-irrigational agriculture and rainwater harvesting and realising projects that fight water scarcity. The activities of the foundation expand to individual houses and industries, trying to create solutions to the shortage of water linked to the fast-growing population of Bangalore. In 2008, the foundation became associated with a new project: Rain Water Concepts Pvt Ltd (I) in a cross subsidisation model. The social business implements rainwater harvesting systems for industries. Besides, it is funding the campaigns of the foundation among farmers and schools. Ayyappa Masagi was awarded the Jamnalal Bajaj Award in 2009. Only four years later, the associated organisation entered the Limca Book of Records for constructing 500 lakes - that is the highest number of artificial lakes created by one company. Furthermore, the NGO claim to have indirectly recharged more than 70,000 borewells and reached around 1.5 million people in 36,000 locations. ==Activities== The goal of the foundation is raising awareness about water shortages and implementing rainwater harvesting systems in to farms, houses, and industries. It offers several systems: * Rooftop rainwater harvesting * Lake type borewell recharging * Infiltration wells * Stream water harvesting * Seepage recharging * Sump type borewell recharging * Non-irrigational agricultural practices * Tree-based agriculture To raise awareness, the foundation attends rallies, sponsors lectures, and gives talks at conferences such as TEDx conference, school education programs, or world water day events. The foundation publishes books that instruct farmers to implement rainwater harvesting systems by themselves. The foundation is helped by international volunteers mainly hosted through a program of FSL India. ==See also== * Rainwater harvesting * Water conservation ==ReferencesInterview of Ayyappa Masagi by Think Change India *Interview of Ayyappa Masagi by KnowYourStar.com Category:Environmental organisations based in India Category:Organisations based in Bangalore Category:Organizations established in 2005 Category:Water conservation in India Category:Nature conservation organizations ","title":"Water Literacy Foundation"},{"id":"35237136","text":"Bhangra () is a 1959 Punjabi romance, comedy and drama film directed by Jugal Kishore, starring Sunder, Nishi and Manju in lead roles. == Synopsis == Sunder, the son of moneylender Kaude Shah, goes to a poor farmer, Bulaki, in the village of Rangpur to get money owed, but falls in love with his daughter Banto.

The summit now contains a small crater lake where weak thermal activity continues. ==Eruptions== A small eruption may have occurred in 1810 (give or take 10 years), but this event is uncertain. The only known eruption from Victory was a long-term eruption that lasted from the late 19th century to the mid 20th century. 1890-1935 ¬± 5 years Eruption An eruption from Victory began in around 1890. The eruption extruded a Lava Dome. The eruption produced deadly Pyroclastic flows that probably resulted in the deaths reported by local residents in the 1890s. The constant glow from Victory's long-term eruption (which could have ended as late as 1940) provided a beacon for passing ships. The stop date for the eruption is unknown but it ended between 1930-1940. ==References== * Global Volcanism Program * Volcano Live * Volcanoes of The World, 3rd ed. 2011, Siebert, Simkin, Kimberly ==External links== * Photo of Victory Volcano on Panoramio.com Category:Stratovolcanoes of Papua New Guinea Category:Active volcanoes ","title":"Victory (volcano)"},{"id":"35237406","text":"Mehrdad Mohammad-Hosseini (, February 8, 1989http://images.the- afc.com/mediakit/acl2012/acl2012-presskit-a1.pdf) is an Iranian football goalkeeper, who currently plays for Esteghlal in Iran Pro League.https://int.soccerway.com/players/mehrdad-mohammad-hosseini/197911/ ==Honours== Club ;Esteghlal *Iran Pro League (1): 2012‚Äì13 **Runner up (1): 2010‚Äì11 *Hazfi Cup (1): 2011‚Äì12 ==References * Mehrdad Hosseini at Persian League * Category:Iranian footballers Category:Living people Category:Esteghlal F.C. players Category:1989 births Category:Association football goalkeepers ","title":"Mehrdad Hosseini"},{"id":"35237429","text":"Michael French is a British actor.

Left to right: MC Lord Magr√£o, Greig Stewart, Fyfe Dangerfield, Aristazabal Hawkesalt=Colour photograph of Guillemots performing live in 2006 , the indie rock band Guillemots have recorded more than 80 songs for their four studio albums and other official releases. The band was formed in November 2004, with their first official material being I Saw Such Things in My Sleep, an extended play (EP) released in September 2005. The EP contained four songs, including \\"Made- Up Lovesong #43\\", a track that would also feature on their first studio album, Through the Windowpane. The release of I Saw Such Things in My Sleep was followed three months later by Guillemots' debut single, \\"Trains to Brazil\\". Like \\"Made-Up Lovesong #43\\", it was also included on Through the Windowpane, which was released in July 2006. The album's songs were well received by critics: review aggregator Metacritic gave the record a score of 81 out of 100, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Craig McLean of The Observer described them as \\"gorgeous tunes that are lithe enough to cope with the little bursts of sonic madness\\". Two additional tracks were released as singles from the album: \\"We're Here\\" and \\"Annie, Let's Not Wait\\". Of the twelve songs on Through the Windowpane, nine were written by lead singer Fyfe Dangerfield. Speaking in 2008, Guillemots member MC Lord Magr√£o remarked: \\"For the first album, Fyfe handled most of the songs. ... We worked with him and developed [them].\\" In October 2006, Guillemots brought out Of the Night, a four-track EP that featured one song written by each member of the band. Eighteen months later, the band released their second album, Red. This album's songs were more pop-orientated than their debut's, and were written by all four members of the group. Magr√£o explained: \\"With the second [album], we ended up improvising loads and getting all the new songs from all of the improvised sessions we had.\\" Of the eleven tracks on the record, nine were credited to Guillemots, with the remaining two being credited to Dangerfield alone. Red songs received less critical acclaim than their debut's; Metacritic awarded the album a score of 60 out of 100, suggesting \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Four tracks‚Äî\\"Get Over It\\", \\"Falling Out of Reach\\" and a double A-side of \\"Kriss Kross\\" and \\"Clarion\\"‚Äîwere released as singles in the UK. Guillemots' third album, Walk the River, was released in April 2011. It was the first Guillemots album to feature neither a strings nor brass section ‚Äì its tracks were described by The Independent as being more \\"noticeably stripped down\\" than those of previous releases. Unlike Through the Windowpane and Red, singles from Walk the River were distributed exclusively online, with no accompanying physical release. Reviews were generally favourable, with Metacritic reporting a score of 69 out of 100 for the record. Three singles were taken from the album: \\"The Basket\\", \\"I Must Be a Lover\\" and \\"I Don't Feel Amazing Now\\". On 7 May 2012, the band announced their intention to release four albums during the year, each representing a different season ‚Äì the first, Hello Land!, was released through Greedbag the same day. ==Songs== Released alt=Colour photograph of Sam Sparro performing live in 2009.

He was called \\"The revolution's journalist\\" by the people of Homs. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, he was the second journalist to be killed during the Syrian uprising. Ferzat Jarban, the first journalist to be killed, was a freelance television camera operator. Basil al-Sayed was the first citizen journalist to be killed. At the time, foreign journalists were banned from Syria by the Bashar al-Assad government. ==Personal == Basil Al-Sayed was born in Syria in 1987. He was a resident of Homs, Syria where he documented the Syrian civil war. He had a brother and a sister and he was the youngest sibling of the three. ==Career== Basil al-Sayad was working as a citizen journalist when he was killed in Homs at the age of 24. He had previously worked as a carpenter. Around the time of his death, al-Sayed was employed at an aluminum factory. He spent his time outside of his job exposing the Syrian government and documenting the civil war. Like many other citizen journalists, he would then post the videos to the internet for the world to witness. Al- Sayed recorded the uprising using a red Samsung video camera. He loaded footage to the YouTube videosharing web site and news organizations around the world incorporated his video into their news. It was also known that al-Sayed spent some of his time helping others. He used his carpentry skills to help repair damaged homes and he delivered food on his motorcycle to families in need. ==Death== Basil al-Sayed died sometime around 27 December 2011. He was shot in the head while trying to capture video of security forces firing at protesters. It was reported that al-Sayed was reporting things many people could not get by being in very dangerous circumstances and this is what ultimately led to his death. He was capturing video at the moment he was shot and killed. ==Context== In March 2011, the Syrian civil war began. During this time, Syrian officials banned international journalists from their country. This prompted a rise in citizen journalist to document and publish the civil war and turmoil that was occurring. Basil al-Sayed was among that group of citizen journalist. He set himself apart by becoming a videographer and putting himself in dangerous situations. He also was known for interviewing Syrians about the state of political and economic turmoil the country was facing. At the time of his death, the conflict between the government and the opposition had been going on for 10 months.http://observers.france24.com/content/20111230-syrian-activist-killed- filming-repression-homs-bab-amr-basid-al-sayed-citizen-journalist-last-video- assad ==Impact== Foreign journalist had been mostly banned in Syria. The only way the world is able to witness the crisis unfolding in Syria, is via the videos uploaded to YouTube captured by citizen journalists. Basil al-Sayed is one among a long list of Syrian citizen journalist murdered. His brave work along that of other citizen journalists, has allowed the world to witness the Syrian crisis between president Bashar al-Assad's regime and the rebels. He was the second Syrian journalist killed. The first was Ferzat Jarban, who was also killed in Homs around November 20, 2011. Since al-Sayed and Jarban, it has been reported that 61 more citizen journalists have lost their lives while trying to document the uprising. Included in those deaths, was Rami al-Sayed, who was Basil al-Sayed's cousin, and h was killed only two months after his cousin. al-Sayed, along with others, set the foot work for future citizen journalist to capture the civil war. ==Reactions== Basil al-Sayed was considered to be a local hero by some and his death saddened and outraged many. He set out to document the Syrian civil war and expose it to the world by uploading hundreds of hours of footage via YouTube. According to a prominent Syrian activist, Rami Jarrah, among thousand of Syrian citizen journalists al-Sayed was one that stood out. Jarrah told NPR news about the dangerous conditions under which he worked: \\"He was documenting stuff that no one could actually get hold of. I don‚Äôt want to say this was expected, but he was always in those situations where you could expect something would happen to him.\\" He was filming when he was shot and his final minutes were caught on camera. This footage caused grief to many that admired him and followed his work. A video was also uploaded to YouTube by an activist, showing al-Sayed's mother and relatives weeping and grieving over his dead body. The international journalist community condemned al-Sayed's intentional murder. ==See also== * List of journalists killed during the Syrian civil war * Siege of Homs ==References * \\"Syria - CNN Farewell to Basil Al Sayed - Photographer Shot by Assad Regime 12-30-11\\".

His first Azov campaigns in 1695 failed, but his second attempt the next year led to victory. To ensure Russian positions in the South, and to shelter the Russian Navy, Peter the Great needed a new haven for the Azov Flotilla, and a fortress to protect it. Azov could not serve as naval base because of shallow waters of the river Don. That is why, a few days after Turkish capitulation, on July 27, 1696 the Russian tsar set out for an expedition to explore the coastline of Azov Sea. The expedition stopped at the cape Tagan-Rog on July 27, where Peter the Great spent the night of July 27‚Äì28, 1696. The cape was selected as the perfect place for the harbour, since the sea around the cape was deep enough for sea boats; there was enough room for a haven with solid stone soil; and the expedition found a small water spring. The first Russian Navy base, Taganrog (Taygan for Turkish in Ottoman sources) was officially founded by Peter the Great on September 12, 1698. Vice-Admiral Cornelis Cruys, who is regarded as the architect of the Russian Navy, became the first Head of Taganrog city in 1698-1702 and in 1711, and produced the first maps of Azov Sea and Don River. ==Construction of the fortress== Plan of Taganrog's haven, 1704. The project for planning and building works in the city was established in 1698 by Austrian engineer Baron Ernst Friedrich von Borgsdorf, basing on the instructions provided by Peter the Great. Taganrog is one of the first Russian cities, which was built according to a detailed pre-established plan. It was also the first artificial haven, and the first fortress made of earth as primary material. The construction was generally completed by 1709. The Saint Trinity fortress was situated on the horn-shaped territory of the cape, earth mounds around 8 metres high, a 5-metre-deep moat that stretched for about 2 miles. Within fortress ramparts were other defensive constructions - three bastions, two demi-bastions, three ravelins armed with cannons and howitzers. Alongside the rampart were casemates, powder magazines, barracks. To prevent an eventual attack from the land there was an additional dry ditch 40 metres wide and 5 metres deep alongside the rampart. Inside the fortress territory was laid out in a radial pattern of star fort united by the central plaza. It had monarch's house, various buildings, Saint Trinity cathedral, warehouses, marketplace, ovens and draw wells. By the middle of 1711 there were 206 buildings made of stone and 162 wood structures inside the fortress for garrison and inhabitants in case of a siege. The main part of the population lived outside the fortress in the so-called \\"slobodas\\". In 1711 the fortress was defended by 293 cannons and 40 howitzers not counting artillery in the haven and on Cherepakha Islet. Taganrog haven's water area was about 774 thousand sq.metres, of rectangular form and was surrounded breakwaters. From the seaside were erected towers, the berth was near the coast. Taganrog seaport is considered as the first port in the world to be created in the open sea and not in a natural bay. Some 30 thousand oak piles were used in the construction of the haven with 199 boxes loaded with stones in between them. Another part of this project was an artificial islet Cherepakha, which was made in the Azov Sea in about 2 kilometers from the fortress. The islet was 59 by 38 metres. There was a citadel, which had an area of 1200 square metres with 127 cannons. In the middle stood a wooden izba for garrison, which was later replaced by a stone building. The islet was built by the personal order of Peter the Great in 1701-1706 of rock fill held by oak piles. In the present days, when the tide is low and blows East wind the islet emerges from the water. During the latest examination of islet in 1981, the remains of old oak piles were still present.–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –¢–∞–≥–∞–Ω—Ä–æ–≥. –û—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ –ß–µ—Ä–µ–ø–∞—Ö–∞. After a defeat suffered by Russian troops from Ottoman Empire during Pruth River Campaign, the Russian tzar had to sign Treaty of the Pruth, returning Azov to Turkey and destroying Taganrog. On September 19, 1711 by the order of Peter the Great, Taganrog was demolished and in February 1712 Russian troops left the town. ==Short revival== For fifty years, the seaport, fortress and town lay in ruins. On April 2, 1769, Russian troops entered Taganrog, and it was definitively ceded by Turkey in the Treaty of Kuchuk Kainarji (1774). The city was re-founded by Catherine the Great, who issued a special decree addressed to the Vice-Admiral Aleksey Senyavin. The reconstruction of the fortress was planned by Russian engineer Mikhail Alexeevich Dedenev. However after the Crimea was annexed by Russian Emprire in 1783, Taganrog Fortress lost its military importance and February 10, 1784, Empress Catherine I signed a decree abolishing the fortifications and transferring the lands in favor of the city. The ships of the Azov Flotilla were transferred into the new city and navy base of Sevastopol, and later in 1803 the bells and plates of the Saint Nicholas Church, including The bell of Chersonesos, were also given in favor of a naval cathedral in Sevastopol. Taganrog continued its development as a civic trade city. The fortress buildings were used for various purposes and were gradually demolished. == See also == * Peter barracks (Taganrog) ‚Äï part of Taganrog Fortress. ==References * History of Taganrog by Pavel Filevsky, Moscow, 1898 * Encyclopedia of Taganrog, Anton Edition, Taganrog, 2008 Category:Buildings and structures in Taganrog Category:Forts in Russia Category:History of Taganrog ","title":"Taganrog Fortress"},{"id":"35237798","text":"Mer Mar is an album by the Japanese noise musician Merzbow and the Norwegian noise musician Lasse Marhaug.

He became notorious for his involvement in election fraud. ==Background== The family's surname had originally been Horewood, but by this time normally spelt Whorwood, taking their name from a small manor in Horewood, later known as Compton Hallows in Kinver, but in 1387 as Haulowe, probably from its late 14th century owners or overlords. Whorwood was the first son of Edward Whorwood of Compton Hallows and of Dorothy Bassett, daughter of Thomas Bassett of Hints. He was the great nephew of the great lawyer Sir William Whorwood, half of whose property he inherited. ==Landowner== Whorwood ultimately had several properties in Shropshire, Staffordshire and Worcestershire, in addition to his ancestral estate.Victoria County History, Staffordshire, XX, 133. Some of these were derived from Sir William Whorwood, whose elder daughter Anne Whorwood, Countess of Warwick had died in 1552. Her husband, Ambrose Dudley, had a life interest in her estates, but when he died in 1590, they passed to Thomas Whorwood.History of Parliament Online: 1558‚Äì1603 Members ‚Äì WHORWOOD, Thomas (Author: Author: W.J.J.) The other daughter Margaret married the recusant Thomas Throckmorton of Coughton, Warwickshire. Throckmorton's estates were frequently sequestrated because of his religious principles. In 1578 he and Whorwood partitioned William's inheritance. By this means Thomas Whorwood acquired the manors of Stourton and Kinver, Broome, Dunsley (in Kinver) and Tyrley on the Staffordshire-Shropshire border, but several of these were subject to the dower of William's widow Margaret Sheldon until her death in 1589.Victoria County History, Staffordshire, XX, 132.Deed of partition: Herefordshire Record Office, E12/S, Whorwood inheritance. Thus Whorwood became considerably richer when his inheritance from his great uncle came into possession in 1590. At that point he moved to Stourton Castle, where he built a new family home. ==Political career== Whorwood was elected one of the two knights of the shire for Staffordshire in the Parliament of 1572. His colleague was John Fleetwood,History of Parliament Online: 1558‚Äì1603 Constituencies ‚Äì Staffordshire a rich landowner who had made a fortune from the dissolution of the monasteries.History of Parliament Online: 1558‚Äì1603 Members ‚Äì FLEETWOOD, John (Author: Author: W.J.J.) The parliament technically lasted for almost twelve years, as the next was summoned in 1584, although it actually met for only three widely spaced sessions. Whorwood's only known contribution came on 25 January 1572, when he spoke in favour of keeping the assizes at Stafford. Now that he was better-known, and especially as he began to come into property, Whorwood was appointed to public offices. About 1573 he was made a justice of the peace for Staffordshire. In 1574 he was pricked to become High Sheriff of Staffordshire, a post of honour, but also onerous and often expensive. However, Whorwood was known to be of very conservative religious views and was probably suspected of being a Catholic sympathiser. Certainly he had close Catholic connections within his family. His election in 1572, sharing the county with Fleetwood, known to be decidedly Protestant, may have been because of the backing of a conservative clique among the Staffordshire landed gentry. This faction, centred on the Harcourts of Ellenhall and Ranton Abbey and their kinsmen, the Astons and the Greys of Enville, Staffordshire had great influence in the county and, although slowly losing their grip, were still a force to be reckoned with. William Whorwood had married into the Grey family. The conservative group were described by Thomas Bentham, the radical Protestant Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, as \\"a knot hurtful to justice and great maintainers\\", i.e. magnates who had a large following whom they maintained through employment or tenancies. It was probably because of these associations that Whorwood lost his place on the commission of the peace in 1580 and for some years his public career was in eclipse. About 1590, Whorwood's daughter Elizabeth married John Sutton or Dudley, brother of Edward Sutton, 5th Baron Dudley.History of Parliament Online: 1558‚Äì1603 Members ‚Äì DUDLEY, alias SUTTON, John (Author: Author: J.E.M.) Apparently this was a runaway marriage. Sutton was the son and brother of peers, but the family was generally in debt. He was supposed, under the terms of his father's will, to receive an annuity of ¬£300, but his brother was unable to pay it. As a result, he was forced to live with the Whorwoods at Compton Hallows. A connection with the nobility, however impoverished, was still a social advantage to the Whorwood. At about the same time as the marriage the death of Ambrose Dudley, a very distant kinsman of his son-in-law soon after that of William Whorwood's widow, brought Thomas into his greatest inheritance. In all his years in the shade, he was never actually accused of any disloyalty to the Crown or the Church of England. During the 1590s, his prestige began to rise again. From 1596 he was back on the commission of the peace for Staffordshire, and in the same year he was pricked Sheriff again. However, Whorwood was now drawn into the Dudley family's violent and unscrupulous dealings, to his own detriment. The Dudleys had long been at odds with the Lytteltons, the Worcestershire branch of a family descended from the great jurist Thomas de Littleton. Lord Dudley and Gilbert Lyttelton became embroiled in a bitter dispute over ownership of Prestwood,History of Parliament Online: 1558‚Äì1603 Members ‚Äì DUDLEY, alias SUTTON, Edward (Author: J.E.M.) a Staffordshire farm near Whorwood's Stourton Castle, near Kinver. The dispute escalated to violence on both sides. After a cattle raid by Dudley, Lyttelton had him brought him before the Star Chamber, which fined him heavily. To smear Dudley, Lyttelton pointed out that he did not maintain his wife and children, choosing instead to live with his mistress, Elizabeth Tomlinson, a coal miner's daughter. The Privy Council then intervened and in August 1597 confined Dudley in the Fleet Prison until he promised to contribute to their upkeep. On his release, he not only fell rapidly into arrears, but immediately embarked on a course of further confrontation with the Lytteltons. Part of Dudley's revenge was to intervene in the 1597 parliamentary elections. By supporting the candidature of his brother John in Staffordshire, Dudley could hope to repair some of the fractures in his own family, opening up a fresh route to profit for his impecunious brother, while damaging the interests of his enemies, as Sir Edward Littleton of Pillaton Hall, a kinsman of Gilbert, had already entered the contest. Dudley was counting on the help of Whorwood, as Sheriff and therefore returning officer in the election. The Dudley campaign was directed specifically against Littleton, who was an ally and client of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, a major force not only in the county but at Court. On the day of the election, 6 October 1597, Whorwood, supposedly neutral, rallied the Dudley supporters on one side of the market square in Stafford. It was later alleged that Whorwood used his authority as Sheriff to release Catholic recusants from the county gaol and allowed them and their wives to vote. He certainly permitted Edward Lord Dudley, a peer to add his voice to his brother's vote. When the voice vote went against Dudley, with Littleton and Sir Christopher Blount, another Essex ally, well ahead of John Sutton, Whorwood marched the Dudley supporters around the town centre, shouting, \\"A Dudley!\\" To make sure of his victory, Littleton demanded that Whorwood conduct a poll. This he began, but stopped when Dudley assured him he would protect him from the consequences. He then went off to dine. He had already furnished an electoral indenture, complete with seals and the names of witnesses, but with the names of the successful candidates left blank. These were then filled in as Sutton and Blount, in order of precedence. Thus Littleton was simply excluded by blatant fraud. Littleton immediately appealed to the Star Chamber, proceeding against both the Suttons and Whorwood. It seems that he later allowed the complaints against the brothers to lapse, while pursuing Whorwood, who had behaved \\"in very indecent and outrageous manner\\". Lettice Knollys, the Countess of Leicester, who was Blount's wife and the mother of Essex, wrote to Essex, complaining of the indignity of her husband being ranked lower in precedence than Sutton, and wishing that the Sheriff should be made to pay for his behaviour. The letter seems to have won Lord Dudley another Privy Council appearance. The outcome of the Star Chamber proceedings is not known: it is unlikely Whorwood escaped punishment. He never again occupied major office. Nevertheless, he was knighted in 1603. Sir Thomas Whorwood died on 2 November 1616. He was succeeded in his estates by his son, Gerard. ==Marriage and family== Thomas Whorwood married Magdalene Edwards, daughter of Rowland Edwards of London, no later than 1563. They had at least one daughter and one son: :*Elizabeth Whorwood, who married John Dudley or Sutton, Baron Dudley's brother. :*Gerard Whorwood (1565‚Äì1627), the heir to the estates.Person page 40338 at thepeerage.com, retrieved 27/04/2012. ==References== Category:1540 births Category:1616 deaths Category:17th-century English people Category:English MPs 1572‚Äì1583 Category:High Sheriffs of Staffordshire Category:English landowners ","title":"Thomas Whorwood"},{"id":"35237823","text":"Frankfort is a town in Amathole District Municipality in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.

This was the second season for football at UTSA and their first as members of the Western Athletic Conference. Larry Coker returned as the teams coach for a second season. The team played its home games at the Alamodome. This was the second of a two-year FCS to FBS transition period for UTSA, so they were not bowl- eligible but will be in 2013. It was UTSA's only season in the WAC. UTSA will join Conference USA on July 1, 2013. They finished the season 8‚Äì4, 3‚Äì3 in WAC play to finish in fourth place. ==Before the season== Previous season In 2011, the Roadrunners represented UTSA in its first year of play in a 4‚Äì6 season. UTSA started the season with a 2‚Äì2 record in the first month of competition with both wins combining for a 75-point advantage and a 3-point loss, with its only decisive loss against ranked FCS Southern Utah. After beating Bacone 54-7, the Runners fell into a three-game slump including eventual undefeated championship contender Sam Houston State and double- overtime loss to fellow FCS move-up South Alabama. UTSA ended its first year with two more wins and yet another 3-point loss. UTSA ended their first year with a losing record, but outplayed their opponents on the statbook due to lopsided wins and multiple close losses. Recruiting 23 recruits signed letters of intent to UTSA for the 2012 season. Another three players decided to walk-on, bringing the recruiting class to a total of 26. Robert Singletary decided to transfer from Baylor to UTSA on June 8. He will sit out the 2012 season as required by NCAA transfer rules, but he brings the class total to 27. Football Fiesta Spring Game The second UTSA Spring Game, called the Football Fiesta Spring Game, was held at the Alamodome on April 15, 2012 at 2:00 PM. It featured the roster divided up into the white team, which would play offense, and the blue team, composed entirely of defense. Due to the composition of the teams, a different scoring system would be used. The white team received 6-points for a touchdown, 3 points for a field goal, 1 point for an extra point, and 1 point for a first down. The blue team received 6 points for a touchdown, 5 points for a takeaway or a safety, 3 points for a stop (meaning you prevent the other team from scoring), and one point for an extra point. The two squads matched up over 4 12-minute quarters with a 10-minute Halftime. Sources: 4,736 fans turned out to see what the UTSA team would have in the 2012 season. They weren't to be disappointed. Six UTSA quarterbacks combined to go 31 of 53 passing for 363 yards and 1 touchdown. After a shaky start the defense also was impressive. They would force 3 interceptions in the back-and-forth showdown. With 1 touchdown rushing, 1 touchdown passing and 2 additional field goals, the final would have been 20-0 in favor of the white team in a regular scoring setting. With the unique scoring system UTSA used, the final would be 44-42 thanks to two first downs before the interception on the White team's final offensive series. ==RosterSchedule== :Schedule Source: ==Depth chartGame summaries== South Alabama Sources: In the opening game of the season, UTSA played the South Alabama Jaguars.

The complex is called ‚Äúabstract‚Äù since its points, which are called ‚Äúcells‚Äù, are not subsets of a Hausdorff space as it is the case in Euclidean and CW complex. Abstract cell complexes play an important role in image analysis and computer graphics. ==History== The idea of abstract cell complexes Reinhard Klette: Cell complexes through time. http://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.404813 (also named abstract cellular complexes) relates to J. Listing (1862) Listing J.: \\"Der Census r√§umlicher Complexe\\". Abhandlungen der K√∂niglichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu G√∂ttingen, v. 10, G√∂ttingen, 1862, 97‚Äì182. and E.

Steinitz has defined an abstract cell complex as C=(E,B,dim) where E is an abstract set, B is an asymmetric, irreflexive and transitive binary relation called the bounding relation among the elements of E and dim is a function assigning a non-negative integer to each element of E in such a way that if B(a, b), then dim(a). V. Kovalevsky (1989) Kovalevsky, V.: \\"Finite Topology as Applied to Image Analysis\\", Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing, v. 45, No. 2, 1989, 141‚Äì161. described abstract cell complexes for 3D and higher dimensions. He also suggested numerous applications to image analysis. In his book (2008) http://www.geometry.kovalevsky.de. he has suggested an axiomatic theory of locally finite topological spaces which are generalization of abstract cell complexes. The book contains among others new definitions of topological balls and spheres independent of metric, a new definition of combinatorial manifolds and many algorithms useful for image analysis. ==Basic results== The topology of abstract cell complexes is based on a partial order in the set of its points or cells. The notion of the abstract cell complex defined by E. Steinitz is related to the notion of an abstract simplicial complex and it differs from a simplicial complex by the property that its elements are no simplices: An n-dimensional element of an abstract complexes must not have n+1 zero-dimensional sides, and not each subset of the set of zero-dimensional sides of a cell is a cell. This is important since the notion of an abstract cell complexes can be applied to the two- and three-dimensional grids used in image processing, which is not true for simplicial complexes. A non-simplicial complex is a generalization which makes the introduction of cell coordinates possible: There are non-simplicial complexes which are Cartesian products of such \\"linear\\" one-dimensional complexes where each zero-dimensional cell, besides two of them, bounds exactly two one-dimensional cells. Only such Cartesian complexes make it possible to introduce such coordinates that each cell has a set of coordinates and any two different cells have different coordinate sets. The coordinate set can serve as a name of each cell of the complex which is important for processing complexes. Abstract complexes allow the introduction of classical topology (Alexandrov-topology) in grids being the basis of digital image processing. This possibility defines the great advantage of abstract cell complexes: It becomes possible to exactly define the notions of connectivity and of the boundary of subsets. The definition of dimension of cells and of complexes is in the general case different from that of simplicial complexes (see below). The notion of an abstract cell complex differs essentially from that of a CW-complex because an abstract cell complex is no Hausdorff space. This is important from the point of view of computer science since it is impossible to explicitly represent a non-discrete Hausdorff space in a computer. (The neighborhood of each point in such a space must have infinitely many points). The book by V. Kovalevsky V. Kovalevsky: \\"Geometry of Locally Finite Spaces\\". Editing house Dr. B√§rbel Kovalevski, Berlin 2008. . contains the description of the theory of locally finite spaces which are a generalization of abstract cell complexes. A locally finite space S is a set of points where a subset of S is defined for each point P of S. This subset containing a limited number of points is called the smallest neighborhood of P. A binary neighborhood relation is defined in the set of points of the locally finite space S: The element (point) b is in the neighborhood relation with the element a if b belongs to the smallest neighborhood of the element a. New axioms of a locally finite space have been formulated, and it was proven that the space S is in accordance with the axioms only if the neighborhood relation is anti-symmetric and transitive. The neighborhood relation is the reflexive hull of the inverse bounding relation. It was shown that classical axioms of the topology can be deduced as theorems from the new axioms. Therefore, a locally finite space satisfying the new axioms is a particular case of a classical topological space. Its topology is a poset topology or Alexandrov topology. An abstract cell complex is a particular case of a locally finite space in which the dimension is defined for each point. It was demonstrated that the dimension of a cell c of an abstract cell complex is equal to the length (number of cells minus 1) of the maximum bounding path leading from any cell of the complex to the cell c. The bounding path is a sequence of cells in which each cell bounds the next one. The book contains the theory of digital straight segments in 2D complexes, numerous algorithms for tracing boundaries in 2D and 3D, for economically encoding the boundaries and for exactly reconstructing a subset from the code of its boundary. ==Abstract Cell Complex Digital Image Representation== A 3x4 digital image decomposed into its Abstract Cell Complex dimensional constituents. A digital image may be represented by a 2D Abstract Cell Complex (ACC) by decomposing the image into its ACC dimensional constituents: points (0-cell), cracks/edges (1-cell), and pixels/faces (2-cell). Digital Image ACC Coordinate Assignment This decomposition together with a coordinate assignment rule to unambiguously assign coordinates from the image pixels to the dimensional constituents permit certain image analysis operations to be carried out on the image with elegant algorithms such as crack boundary tracing, digital straight segment subdivision, etc. One such rule maps the points, cracks, and faces to the top left coordinate of the pixel. These dimensional constituents require no explicit translation into their own data structures but may be implicitly understood and related to the 2D array which is the usual data structure representation of a digital image. This coordinate assignment rule and the renderings of each cell incident to this image is depicted in the image at right. == References == Category:Topology ","title":"Abstract cell complex"},{"id":"35238308","text":"Mhlangeni (also known as Hertzog) is a settlement in Amathole District Municipality in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.

In 1992, at age 13, he went through DJ training at KALX 90.7 FM, the radio station of the University of California at Berkeley. This experience with music eventually led Ebtekar to the world of graffiti and ultimately back to an interest in visual art. In 1998 he was chosen to participate in a workshop at Zeum Art and Technology Center (now Children's Creativity Museum) with New York‚Äìbased artist Tim Rollins and K.O.S. (Kids of Survival) to create work for the center's inaugural exhibition. Ebtekar, along with several other young artists from the San Francisco Bay Area, came to form the core unit for a short lived West Coast chapter of KOS. One year later, Ebtekar traveled to Tehran, Iran to visit extended family which led him to return several months later to study art. Initially studying with a traditional Persian miniature painter, Ebtekar soon discovered the mid-20th Century style of Qahveh-khanehei painting (Iranian coffeehouse painting), and he went on to study under master Qahveh- khanehei painter Mohammad Farahani. A style defined as much by its popularity amongst regular folk as its distance from court arts. In contradistinction to the official court painters of the time, qahveh khanehei painters brought fine art from the exclusive province of those with money and power to the domain of the common people. A singular characteristic of Qahveh-khanehei painting was its freedom, as artists of this style created their work with neither external themes nor the attention to proper anatomy and perspective as seen in miniature paintings. Iranian Coffeehouse painters worked entirely from their imagination and creative ability. It's entirely fitting that Ebtekar found early artistic inspiration from the worlds of graffiti and the modern tradition of Qahveh-khanehei painting, as his work has encompassed comparable populist sensibilities spanning continents, celebrating the stories and lives of heroic everyday people across time. Education Following studying traditional painting in Iran with Mohammad Farahani, Ebtekar went on to pursue a formal education in fine arts. In 2002, he received his B.F.A. degree from the San Francisco Art Institute, followed by an M.F.A from Stanford University in 2006. He served as a Visiting Lecturer in the Department of Art Practice at the University of California at Berkeley from 2007 to 2008, and has served as visiting faculty in the Department of Art and Art History at Stanford University since 2009. ==Collections== * Whitney Museum of American Art, New York City, New York * Stanford University Special Collections, Stanford University, Stanford, California * Crocker Art Museum, Sacramento, California * Orange County Museum of Art, Santa Ana, California * Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley, California * Devi Art Foundation, India * de Young Museum, San Francisco, California * the Microsoft Art Collection in Redmond, Washington * Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville, Arkansas * San Francisco International Airport, San Francisco, California ==Exhibitions== Ebtekar's work has been included in over 70 group exhibitions, 5 two-person exhibitions, and 12 solo exhibitions.

He then attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied modern history. He graduated from the University of Cambridge with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree (later promoted to MA (Cantab) as per tradition), a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) degree and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree. His doctoral thesis was on Edward M. Kennedy's role in the US Democratic Party in the 1980s, which was published in 2010 as his first solo book, Kennedy vs. Carter: The 1980 Battle for the Democratic Party's Soul. At Cambridge he was active in student journalism, contributing to student newspaper Varsity. Stanley also unsuccessfully ran for a sabbatical post on Cambridge University Students' Union, standing in 2007 for Welfare Officer. His manifesto consisted of a handwritten note simply reading \\"This is hand written because I was too drunk to write a manifesto. There is no better testament to my character.\\" ==Academic career== Stanley held lectureships at the University of Sussex in 2008‚Äì09 and Royal Holloway, University of London, in 2009‚Äì11, and from 2011 to 2012 he was an associate member of the Rothermere American Institute at the University of Oxford. He is the recipient of a Leverhulme Trust Grant. In November 2011, he organised a conference called History: What is it good for?, which generated some controversy after one of the speakers, David Starkey, said that the national curriculum in British schools overlooks British culture. ==Media== Stanley is a columnist and leader writer for the Daily Telegraph, and regular contributor to CNN. He reports on American politics and culture, including the 2016 election campaigns. He contributes to History Today, and Literary Review and has written pieces for The Guardian and The Spectator. He wrote and presented a documentary for the BBC entitled Family Guys? What Sitcoms Say About America Now, which was broadcast in October 2012. He is also an occasional pundit on BBC News, CNBC, Sky News and Channel 4 News. Stanley has presented Radio 4's Thought for the Day, is a contributor on The Moral Maze and has appeared several times on the panel of BBC's Question Time. ==Politics== Stanley joined the Labour Party at the age of 15. He was Chair of Cambridge University Labour Club in 2003‚Äì04, and stood as the Labour candidate for his home constituency of Sevenoaks at the 2005 general election, where he came third. He has since distanced himself from the Labour Party, and has been arguing in support of the US Republican Party. In the 2017 general election, Stanley allied himself with the Conservative Party and voted for them for the first time. Stanley was a strong supporter of Britain's campaign to leave the European Union. ==Personal life== In October 2012, Stanley stated he was \\"raised a good Baptist boy\\". Later, he considered himself to be an Anglican, beginning around \\"one glorious summer\\" in 2002, and was baptised as an Anglican in Little St. Mary's, Cambridge, in New Year 2003. He subsequently aligned himself with the Church of England's Anglo-Catholic wing, before converting to the Catholic Church at age 23. ==Publications== *Timothy Stanley and Alexander Lee, The End of Politics: Realignment and the Battle for the Centre Ground (London: Politico's, London, 2006) *Timothy Stanley, Kennedy vs. Carter: The 1980 Battle for the Democratic Party's Soul (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2010) *Timothy Stanley, The Crusader: The Life and Tumultuous Times of Pat Buchanan (New York: Thomas Dunne, 2012) *Jonathan Bell and Timothy Stanley (eds.), Making Sense of American Liberalism (Champaign: University of Illinois Press, 2012) *Timothy Stanley, Citizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration between LA and DC Revolutionized American Politics (New York: Thomas Dunne Books, 2014) ==External links== *Tim Stanley's Daily Telegraph blog *Tim Stanley's personal website *Tim Stanley on Twitter ==References== Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:British historians Category:British male journalists Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Anglicanism Category:English columnists Category:People educated at The Judd School Category:People from Sevenoaks Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:The Daily Telegraph people Category:English Anglo-Catholics Category:English Roman Catholics ","title":"Tim Stanley"},{"id":"35238471","text":"Kerkidan is a village in Aravan District of Osh Region of Kyrgyzstan.

(2012, in press). Transnationale Kommunikation. Eine Einf√ºhrung. Wiesbaden: Verlag f√ºr Sozialwissenschaften. The expression serves as an umbrella term that encompasses different research approaches (e.g., international communication, transnational communication) that can heuristically be differentiated by their specific use of research perspectives, as well as particular levels and objects of analysis (see dimensions of analysis). Thematically, research is often concerned with the political dimension of mediated cross-border communication. Examples include studies on the impact of mediated cross-border communication on foreign policy (CNN effect,Volkmer, I. (1999). News in the global sphere: a study of CNN and its impact on global communications. Luton: University of Luton Press.) political change (media and democratization,Voltmer, K. (2008).

An at least implicit common feature to almost all of the aforementioned topics is their general interest in answering the question to what extent nationally, culturally or otherwise defined media systems influence each other, converge or whether they can pertain distinct identities under conditions of mediated cross-border communication. Mediated cross-border communication is considered as becoming increasingly important both as a real world phenomenon and field of research as there has been a steady strengthening of the conditions of globalization and media innovations that offer fast and low-cost forms of cross-border communication since the second half of the twentieth century.McQuail, D. (2010). McQuail's Mass Communication Theory (pp. 248-269). London: SAGE. However, critics argue that the importance of the nation state remains high; for example, most online communication still takes place between citizens of the same nation state. Also, the responsibility for most broadcasting and press legislation usually rests with individual national states.Hafez, K. (2007). The myth of media globalization. Cambridge: Polity Press. ==History of research== The history of mediated cross-border communication research is closely related to the three major decades of the 20th century, which stimulated and influenced this field of research in terms of themes, funding sources as well as ideologies: The two world wars in the first half of the 20th century, the Cold War decade, and finally the era of globalization after the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989 and the former Soviet Union in 1991. Throughout the time, technological innovations such as satellite television or the Internet and the expansion of media markets across national borders have further stimulated research interest in mediated cross-border communication. Milestones of mediated cross-border communication research  1930‚Äì1950: As psychological warfare (propaganda paradigm)  The propaganda operations of the great powers in the twentieth century's two world wars are often considered to have been the initiating driving forces for sustained scholarly interest into mediated cross-border research. Although cross-border communication activities have been set in place by national governments since ancient history (Melissen, 2005, p. 3)Melissen, J. (2005): The new public diplomacy: between theory and practice. In J. Melissen (Ed.), The new public diplomacy (pp. 3-27). New York: Palgrave Macmillan. it was not until the early twentieth century that such international propaganda efforts were followed by systematic academic research (McQuail, 2010).McQuail, D. (2010). McQuail's Mass Communication Theory (pp. 248-269). London: SAGE. Literature reviews show that this trend continued far into the aftermath of World War II until development and modernization became leading research themes in the 1960s (see Smith, 1956; Mowlana, 1973).Smith, B. L. (1956). Trends in research on international communication and public opinion, 1945-1955. Public Opinion Quarterly, 20(1). 182-195.Mowlana, H. (1973). Trends in research on international communication in the United States. International Communication Gazette, 19. 79-90.  1950‚Äì1970: As development prompter (modernization paradigm)  In the 1950s, studies on mediated cross-border communication started to increasingly stress its assumed function as development and modernization prompter (development communication), not least due to the dozens of countries in Asia, Africa, and South America who gained their political independence at that time. US government interests to \\"modernize\\" these countries paralleled with sustained research efforts regarding the role of (mediated cross-border) mass media in this context (for a critical perspective on the role of US policies in the field see Hardt, 1988).Hardt, H. (1988). Comparative media research: the world according to America. Critical Studies in Mass Communication, 5. 129-146. At that time, the latter was predominantly conceptualized as one-way flow of communication from government development agencies to people in Third World nations. Typically, strong media effects were assumed that would change attitudes and behavior of individuals, thus supporting the modernization of countries (Lerner, 1958).Lerner, D. (1958) The Passing of Traditional Society. New York: Free Press. Important proponents of the modernism paradigm later admitted its limitations and shortcomings, especially with regard to the application of the Western model of development to Third World countries (Schramm, 1979; Rogers, 1976).Schramm, W. I. (1979). Mass media and national development 1979 (international commission for the study of communication problems, no. 42). Paris: UNESCO.Rogers, E. M. (1976). Communication and development: the passing of the dominant paradigm. Communication Research, 3(2). 213-240. The reduction of development and modernization to economic growth (poverty as equivalent to underdevelopment), overestimation of strong media effects and the ethnocentric promotion of adopting a Western model of society are today commonly viewed as the central reasons why modernization theory was subverted by early 1970. The 1950s also showed early studies of international news flows, with assumingly the first one conducted by the International Press Institute in 1953,International Press Institute (1953). The flow of news. Z√ºrich. which was followed by more systematic analyses in the early 1960s by Wilbur Schramm (1960),Schramm, W. (1960). One day in the world's press. Stanford: Stanford University Press. thus initiating research concerned with the \\"balance\\" of news exchanges between developed and developing nations (Hur, 1984, p. 365). Furthermore, the then newly established UNESCO started to function as an important funding source and research agenda setter, sponsoring field-related studies on foreign news coverage and international news flows (for early examples see Kaiser, 1953; Williams, 1953).Kaiser, J. (1953). One week's news: comparative study of 17 major dailies for a seven-day period. Paris: UNESCO.Williams, F. (1953). La transmission des informations: les t√©l√©communications et la presse. Paris: UNESCO. Another landmark study in this phase of research was the ‚ÄúFour theories of the press‚Äù put forward by Siebert, Peterson and Schramm (1956),Siebert, F., Peterson, T., & Schramm, W. (1956). Four theories of the press. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press. which offered a framework for comparative media system research. With regard to varying degrees of state interventionism, the authors described four ideal types of how media were ought to be organized (authoritarian, libertarian, Soviet communism, and social responsibility). Despite the fact that the book received widespread scholarly attention, it is today commonly criticized for its ideological bias, lack of empirical concern and universal approach (Nerone, 2004).Nerone, J. (2004). Four theories of the press in hindsight: reflections of a popular model. In M. Semati (Ed.), New frontiers in international communication theory (pp. 21-32). Oxford: Rowman & Littlefield Publisherhs.  1970‚Äì1990: As media imperialism (dependency paradigm)  Between the 1970s and early 1980s, research was characterized by an unprecedented amount of critical assessments of news and entertainment flows between developed and developing nations, framed by dependency theories and notions of media imperialism (see also cultural imperialism; for conceptual differences see Lee, 1988).Lee, P. S-N. (1988) Communication imperialism and dependency: a conceptual clarification. International Communication Gazette, 41. 69‚Äì83. Proponents of the latter criticized the dominance of Western mass media in the evolving global media market as being a threat to the cultural identity of developing nations (e.g., Schiller, 1976; Tunstall, 1977).Schiller, H. I.(1976) Communication and cultural domination. White Plains, NY: M. E. Sharpe.Tunstall, J. (1977). The media are American. London: Constable. Indeed, empirical studies on international information flows found an \\"unbalanced one-way traffic\\" (Nordenstreng & Varis, 1974)Nordenstreng, K., & Varis, T. (1974). Television traffic - a one-way street? A survey and analysis of international flow of television programme material (Reports and Papers on Mass Communication No. 70). Paris: UNESCO. from big exporting countries to the rest of the world. Again, UNESCO played an important role in this context that is shown by guest contributions from top representatives to major scholarly journals (e.g., Masmoudi, 1979),Masmoudi, M. (1979). The new world information order. Journal of Communication, 29(2). 172‚Äì185. its function as funding source for international comparative research projects (e.g., Nordenstreng & Varis, 1974),Nordenstreng, K., & Varis, T. (1974). Television traffic - a one-way street? A survey and analysis of international flow of television programme material (Reports and Papers on Mass Communication No. 70). Paris: UNESCO. and especially through the publication of the so-called MacBride report, which synthesized the controversial debate on imbalances and inequalities in international flows of communication (UNESCO, 1980, pp. 145‚Äì149; pp. 106‚Äì111)UNESCO (1980). Many voices one world: towards a new more just and more efficient world information and communication order (pp. 145-149; 106-111). Paris: UNESCO. that by then was coined by the term \\"New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO)\\". The report was echoed by extensive academic attention ranging from hailing the report's call for a democratization of mediated cross-border communication to criticizing it for its alleged technological determinism (see Hamelink, 1980)Hamelink, C. (Ed.) (1980). Communication in the eighties: a reader on the ‚ÄúMacBride Report‚Äù. Rome: IDOC International. and led to a dramatic growth of empirical studies in this field in the beginning 1980s (Mowlana, 1985, p. 10).Mowlana, H. (1985). International flows of news: an annotated bibliography. Paris: UNESCO. However, most inquiries remained rather descriptive with additional normative considerations, whereas explanatory approaches were largely missing (Chang, 1998, p. 529).Chang, T.-K. (1998). All countries not created equal to be news: world system and international communication. Communication Research, 25. 528-563. For instance, Hur (1984, p. 375)Hur, K. K. (1984). A critical analysis of international news flow research. Critical Studies in Mass Communication, 1. 365‚Äì378. reported after a review of 80 studies from 1970 to 1982, that key questions such as whether international news flow or coverage is influenced by news events themselves or relationships between nations, or by the media involved remained largely unexplained. After the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989 and the former Soviet Union in 1991, dependency theory and the media imperialism thesis became largely abandoned from research agenda, to be replaced by concepts of media globalisation and perspectives of transnational communication. While some say this happened in tune with the neo-liberal climate of the time (e.g., Curran, 2002, p. 171),Curran, J. (2002). Media and power. London: Routledge. the passing of the then prevailing paradigm is also to be attributed to its inability to explain forms of hybrid media systems as it rather focused on the quantitative supply as opposed to the particular use of media contents (for details see section on Media imperialism: the evolution of an influence perspective). Thus, scholars argued that the plain notion of Western domination failed to account for the complex and multidirectional nature of mediated cross-border communication (e.g., Sreberny-Mohammadi, 1996).Shreberny-Mohammadi A., The global and the local in international communications. In J. Curran and M. Gurevitch, Mass Media and Society (pp. 118-138). London: Arnold. Yet, the paradigm's inherent influence perspective and other central questions of the debate keep re- emerging under different headings and more advanced concepts such as hybridization and glocalisation.  1990‚Äìtoday: As transnationalization and hybridization of national public spheres (globalization paradigm)  From the 1990s on, another shift of paradigm took place with the emergence of globalization as the new key term of the field. Whereas previous decades of research for most of the part followed an influence perspective, the 1990s and especially from 2000 on saw a rise of transnational approaches that applied transgression perspective on mediated cross-border communication. According to Hafez,2002, p. 28 two different types of globalization theorems can be differentiated, which are coined by the terms of conversion and domestication. The idea of conversion is represented in works such as McLuhan's ‚Äúglobal village‚Äù-approach, that expects the emergence of a global consciousness. The second type is coined by the term of glocalisation. A third major stimulus to the field of study was set into place in 2004 with the publication of ‚ÄúComparing media systems‚Äù (see Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics.Hallin, D. C., & Mancini, P. (2004). Comparing media systems: Three models of media and politics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Unlike the ‚ÄúFour theories of the press‚Äù, an emphasis was put on the synthesis of empirical findings. Furthermore, the authors tried to avoid the universal approach put forward by Siebert et al., focusing themselves on North America and Western Europe countries. The work has been stimulating a great number of subsequent studies that try to adopt and modify the models and analytical dimensions (e.g., Political parallelism) of ‚ÄúComparing media systems‚Äù to other parts of the world.Hallin, D. C., & Mancini, P. (Eds.) (2012). Comparing media systems beyond the western world. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. == Dimensions of analysis == Research approaches to mediated cross-border communication can be categorized with regard to the respective dimensions of analysis. Wessler and Br√ºggemann (2012)Wessler, H., & Br√ºggemann, M. (2012, in press). Transnationale Kommunikation. Eine Einf√ºhrung. Wiesbaden: Verlag f√ºr Sozialwissenschaften. propose three dimensions of analysis: (1) research perspectives, (2) levels of analysis and (3) objects of analysis. Most entities discussed below are considered to be convergent by nature, thus being open for combination and parallel use.  Research perspectives  Three different research perspectives are commonly applied to the field of mediated cross-border communication # the ‚Äúcomparative perspective‚Äù # the ‚Äúinfluence perspective‚Äù # the ‚Äútransgression perspective‚Äù As a ‚Äúmeta-method‚Äù, the comparative perspective is common to the vast majority of studies in this academic field and can be combined with all subsequent methods, perspectives, levels and objects of analysis. (1) The ‚Äúcomparative perspective‚Äù (Comparative research) seeks for similarities and differences as well as processes of convergence and divergence (see transformation processes of media systems) between different entities such as national media systems or organizations. With regard to research goals, two basic comparative research designs can be differentiated (Przeworski & Teune, 1970;Przeworski, A., & Teune, H. (1970). The logic of comparative social inquiry Meckstroth, 1975Meckstroth, T. W. (1975) ‚ÄúMost different systems‚Äù and ‚Äúmost similar systems‚Äù: a study in the logic of comparative inquiry. Comparative Political Studies, 8(2). 132-157). The ‚ÄúMost different systems, similar outcome design‚Äù aims to compare heterogeneous media systems to identify general statements which are (relatively) invariant concerning the systems within which observations are made (e.g., in a survey of journalists from seventeen explicitly different countries, Hanitzsch et al. (2010)Hanitzsch, T., Anikina, M., Berganza, R., Cangoz, I., Coman, M., Harmada, B., Hanusch, F., Karadjov, Ch. D., Mellado, C., Moreira, S. V., Mwesige, P. G., Plaisance, P. L., Reich, Z., Seethaler, J., Skewes, E. A., Noor, D. V., Yuen, K. W. (2010). Modeling perceived influences on journalism: evidence from a cross-national survey of journalists. Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly, 87(1). 5-22. extracted relatively invariant cross-national structures of perceived influences on journalism). By contrast, the ‚ÄúMost similar system, different outcome design‚Äù stresses the individual causes of observed differences between a given number of media systems. The rationale behind this second approach is that causes of intercultural or international differences are thought to be easier to interpret when the cases under study share many similarities (e.g., Hallin and Mancini (2012, p. 288)Hallin, D. C., & Mancini, P. (Eds.) (2012). Comparing media systems beyond the western world. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. said that one of the main reasons for focusing on Western media systems in their seminal work from 2004 was to reduce the number and complexity of variables). {  - ! Type !! Cases under study !! Research objectives -  Most different systems, similar outcome  Media systems with contrasting structural features  Identification of predictor variables of relatively invariant cross-national/cultural outcomes -  Most similar systems, different outcome  Media systems with similar structural features  Identification of predictor variables of individual country/culture- specific outcomes - } (2) The ‚Äúinfluence perspective‚Äù focuses on patterns of exchange, influence, dominance and resistance in the relationship between two or more entities. Studies that follow this perspective ask, for example, to what extent American mass media are in some respects dominant and exert influence to other media systems worldwide (Americanization of the Media, New World Information and Communication Order).De Grazia, V. (2005). Irresistible empire: America's advance through 20th century Europe. Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press. (see also development communication, international communication) (3) The ‚Äútransgression perspective‚Äù is looking for mediated cross-border communication that leads to structures and processes beyond traditional nation state or cultural borders e.g., European public sphere), whereas the aforementioned influence perspective is stronger connected to the idea of fixed entities.Wessler, H., & Br√ºggemann, M. (2012, in press). Transnationale Kommunikation. Eine Einf√ºhrung. Wiesbaden: Verlag f√ºr Sozialwissenschaften.  Levels of analysis  (1) ‚ÄúIndividual/group‚Äù, (2) ‚Äúorganization‚Äù, (3) ‚Äústate/society‚Äù, (4) ‚Äúlinguistic/political/cultural areas‚Äú and (5) ‚Äúthe world/global level‚Äù constitute the five levels of analysis. It is important to note that these levels are (a) not hierarchal (e.g., mediated cross-border communication between groups in social media constituted by individuals from different places worldwide) and that (b) unit of analysis and record unit are not necessarily one and the same (e.g., foreign coverage of multiple newspapers as recording unit, which then get aggregated, compared and analyzed on a nation/society level).  Objects of analysis  A broad range of objects of analysis is subject to mediated cross-border communication research: (1) ‚Äúmedia publics‚Äù, (2) ‚Äúmedia contents‚Äù, (3) ‚Äúmedia products‚Äù, (4) ‚Äúmedia structures‚Äù and (5) ‚Äúsocietal actors‚Äù. For example, in their study from 2004, Hallin and Mancini ask for the relationship between media and politics, hereby analyzing (among others) the development of national mass circulation press, literacy rates and the autonomy of journalists from societal actors (such as political parties and the government) from a comparative perspective.Hallin, D. C., & Mancini, P.(2004). Comparing media systems: Three models of media and politics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. == Research approaches ==  International communication  International communication research is concerned with communication that crosses nation state borders without actually contesting them. The field of international communication is characterized by an influence perspective, comparing for example news flows between national media systems in order to analyze, for example, structures of dominance and resistance. (see also: Media imperialism). While this perspective has been central to the field of international communication throughout the 1960s and 1970s, there has been increasing criticism since the 1980s, with scholars arguing that it would lack to be able to explain the complexity of mediated cross-border communication and its effectsKraidy, M. (2005). Hybridity or the cultural logic of globalization. Delhi: Dorling Kindersley. (see also: Methodological refinements and the relativization of the media imperialism thesis).  Transnational communication  Being a more recent and emerging research approach, transnational communication is concerned with communication that transcends nation state borders, thus undermining their importance and eventually leading to structures and processes of transgression. Examples include: * TV channels such as CNN, whose program is no longer directed toward particular national or cultural but global audiences. * Media events such as the U.N. climate summits which contribute toward a globally defined identity (Eide, Kunelius, & Kumpu (2010).Eide, E., Kunelius, R., & Kumpu, V. (Eds.) (2010). Global climate ‚Äì local journalisms: a transnational study of how media make sense of climate summits. Bochum: Projektverlag. * Transnational civil society such as Amnesty International who contribute to the definition, awareness and spread of global issues such as human rights. Especially the Europeanization of national public spheres has attracted major scholarly interest covered by this research approach (e.g., Wessler, Peters, Br√ºggemann, Kleinen-von-K√∂nigsl√∂w, & Sifft (2008),Wessler, H., Peters, B., Br√ºggemann, M., Kleinen-von K√∂nigsl√∂w, K., & Sifft, S. (2008). Transnationalization of public spheres. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.) drawing light to questions like for example to what extent discourses in European countries converge, or show signs of discursive integration and collective identification. ==Selected Key Findings, Criticism and Advancements==  Media imperialism: the evolution of an influence perspective  A common frame to the debate on global media flows and export of US media contents to other countries by the early 1970s, the media imperialism thesis (see also cultural imperialism) has repeatedly been criticized for basing its assumptions on an over-simplified model of communication. Claiming forms of cultural dominance by Western media as a result of their worldwide commercial distribution, the thesis implicitly applied the idea of communication as a process of cause and effects (see also linear model of communication)Shannon, C. E., & Weaver, W. (1949). The mathematical theory of communication. Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press to the field of mediated cross-border communication, thus disregarding the active interpretation and local adaption of media contents by their audiences (Kraidy, 2005).Kraidy, M. (2005). Hybridity or the cultural logic of globalization. Delhi: Dorling Kindersley. The latter can be illustrated by the global spread of hip hop culture: Originated in the USA during the 1970s, it has ever since then been integrated into local contexts throughout the world with distinct local adaptions in many diverse countries (see Hip hop by nationality). For example, during the Arab Spring, a Libyan musician fueled the rebellion with his anti-government songs, connecting typical US rap music with local lyrics and issues. On a methodological level, the criticism mentioned above has often been accompanied by a call for a shift of focus from the sheer quantitative supply to the particular consumption and use of media contents in order to adequately analyze their impact on, for example, the potential loss or homogenization of cultural identities (e.g., Liebes & Katz, 1990;Liebes, T., & Katz, E. (1990). The export of meaning: cross-cultural readings on Dallas. New York: Oxford University Press Sepstrup, 1989.Sepstrup, P. (1989). Research into international television flows: a methodological contribution. European Journal of Communication 4(4), 393-407.) For instance, in a seminal study by Liebes and Katz (1990)Liebes, T., & Katz, E. (1990). The export of meaning: cross-cultural readings on Dallas. New York: Oxford University Press the authors found that globally exported US entertainment products such as the TV series Dallas encounter local contexts of interpretations formed by the particular cultural backgrounds of their recipients, thus showing that identical media contents may be read and adapted in very diverse ways. However, the degree to which an audience actively interprets media contents is also subject to variance, as subsequent research has shown.Biltereyst, D. (1991). Resisting American hegemony: a comparative analysis of the reception of domestic and US fiction. European Journal of Communication 6, 469-497. Nevertheless, McQuailMcQuail, D. (2010). McQuail's Mass Communication Theory (pp. 248-269). London: SAGE. reports that the media imperialism thesis has been widely abandoned from the study of mediated cross- border communication.

Over- estimation of media globalization  Hafez (2007)Hafez, K. (2007). The myth of media globalization. Cambridge: Polity Press. argues that the qualitative dimension of mediated cross-border communication may be much different compared to what some scholars assume it would be. Speaking of the \\"myth of media globalization\\", Hafez warns not to confound technical potentials of media innovations with their actual use. For example, Hafez refers to statistics saying that while many people have access to foreign TV channels, the majority mainly uses national or local channels.Hafez, K. (2007). The myth of media globalization (p. 24). Cambridge: Polity Press. Similar to that, most people use the Internet as a ‚Äòlocal medium‚Äô, as the bulk of accessed websites and communication stays within national borders. The increasingly multilinguistic character of the Internet may even further the fragmentation of the World Wide Web into separate public spheres (Hafez, 2002, p. 90)Hafez, K. (2002). International vergleichende Medienforschung: Eine unterentwickelte Forschungsdimension. In K. Hafez (Ed.), Die Zukunft der internationalen Kommunikationwissenschaft in Deutschland (pp. 59-94). Hamburg: Deutsches √úbersee-Institut. Such notions concerned with the use of media correspond to insights on the level of media contents gained by an international comparative study of online-news websites conducted by Quandt (2008),Quandt, T. (2008). (No) news on the world wide web? Journalism Studies, 9(5). 717-738. who found that in most cases coverage is much limited by the traditional, national context, concluding that online-news may not be as \\"global\\" as one might expect. In accordance with these findings, Halavais (2000)Halavais, A. (2000). National border on the world wide web. New Media and Society 2(7), 7-28. reported after surveying 4000 websites that although geographic borders may be removed from cyberspace, the 'real world' social structures keep inscribed online: the number of hyperlinks that cross international borders are significantly less compared to those which stay within national borders.  The making of a transnational public sphere: the case of Europe  For a long time, the academic debate on the existence of a transnational European public sphere was characterized by rather pessimistic viewpoints (e.g., Habermas, 1998).Habermas, J. (1998). Die postnationale Konstellation. Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp Verlag. This kind of skepticism was fueled by assumption regarding (e.g.): * the fragmented nature of national public spheres * language barriers * disinterest of audiences in European issues * lack of transnational European media outlets. However, empirical findings on mediated cross-border communication between national public spheres in Europe have contributed to an empirical informed re-assessment of the aforementioned pessimistic picture. While there is indeed only little empirical evidence on an emerging European public sphere in the sense of one that would replace the existing national public spheres, research has stressed the phenomenon of a transnationalization of national public spheres (Wessler, Peters, Br√ºggemann, Kleinen-von- K√∂nigsl√∂w, & Sifft, 2008),Wessler, H., Peters, B., Br√ºggemann, M., Kleinen-von K√∂nigsl√∂w, K., & Sifft, S. (2008). Transnationalization of public spheres. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan. allowing the latter remaining in place while at the same time contributing to transnational European debates. According to Br√ºggemann, Sifft, Kleinen-von-K√∂nigsl√∂w, Peters, and Wimmel (2006, p. 304),Br√ºggemann, M., Sifft, S., Kleinen-von-K√∂nigsl√∂w, K., Peters, B. & Wimmel, A. (2006). Segmentierte Europ√§isierung. Trends und Muster der Transnationalisierung von √ñffentlichkeit in Europa. In H. We√üler (Ed.), Bernhard Peters. Der Sinn von √ñffentlichkeit (p. 304). Frankfurt am Main: suhrkamp taschenbuch wissenschaft. this specific kind of transnationalization can empirically be measured in media coverage by the following dimensions: {  - ! Dimension !! Description !! Indicators -  Vertical Dimension: Governance Surveillance  Public discourse on EU-institutions, EU- actors und EU-policies  Mentioning of EU-institutions; EU-policy as main topic of an article -  Vertical Dimension: Collective Identity  Mediated establishment of a European community sense or feeling  Use of the expression \\"we Europeans\\" -  Horizontal Dimension: Discourse Convergence  Media attention on other European countries  References to European countries -  Horizontal Dimension: Discursive Integration  Mediated exchange of arguments and positions between European countries  Direct or indirect quotes of foreign actors; - } A number of case- and longitudinal studies (e.g., Wessler, Peters, Br√ºggemann, Kleinen-von-K√∂nigsl√∂w, & Sifft (2008);Wessler, H., Peters, B., Br√ºggemann, M., Kleinen-von K√∂nigsl√∂w, K., & Sifft, S. (2008). Transnationalization of public spheres. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan. for a similar approach: Koopmans & Meyer, 2010Koopmans, J. E., & Meyer, M.F. (2010). The Europeanisation of public spheres: Comparisons across issues, time, and countries. In R. Koopmans & P. Statham (Ed.), The making of a European public sphere. Media discourse and political contention (pp. 63-96). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), could show an intensifying observation of EU institutions and issues by national media, high but constant numbers of references to other European countries since the early 1980s, with powerful countries ranking on top. Although on a much lower level, this also holds true for the dimension of discursive integration, whereas only little evidence could be found for the emergence of a collective identity. Furthermore, a shared history of interdependency as well as population size respectively the corresponding political power showed to be valid predictors of the number of references to a given country (Wessler, Skorek, Kleinen-von- K√∂nigsl√∂w, Held, Dobreva, & Adolphsen, 2008Wessler, H., Skorek, M., Kleinen- von-K√∂nigsl√∂w, K., Held, M., Dobreva, M., Adolphsen, M. (2008). Comparing media systems and media content: online newspapers in ten eastern and western European countries. Journal of Global Mass Communication, 1(3/4), 165-189)). In sum, the studies mentioned above form the picture of a \\"nationally segmented Europeanization\\": Br√ºggemann, Hepp, Kleinen-von-K√∂nigsl√∂w and Wessler (2009)Br√ºggemann, M., Hepp, A., Kleinen-von K√∂nigsl√∂w, K., & Wessler, H.

Lockspeiser studied at the Paris Conservatory between 1922 and 1926 with Alexandre Tansman and Nadia Boulanger and at the Royal College of Music in London from 1929 to 1930 with Charles Herbert Kitson and Malcolm Sargent. He was voted into the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in 1948 for his services to French music. Lockspeiser's extensive writings on Debussy include a two-volume biography, Debussy: His Life and Mind (1962, 1965), which was the culmination of 30 years of intense research into the composer's life and personality. According to Mark DeVoto of The Boston Musical Intelligencer, this tome \\"remains a landmark work of biography enriched by a wide-ranging analysis of Debussy‚Äôs cultural background and literary and artistic influences.\\"DeVito. He contributed the entry on Debussy in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, articles on Debussy, Felix Mendelssohn and Sergei Diaghilev to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and numerous articles for Gramophone, Music & Letters, The Listener and The Musical Times. He was a guest lecturer at the University of London between 1966 and 1971; afterwards, he served in the same capacity at the Coll√®ge de France.Larousse Lockspeiser became London music critic for the Yorkshire Post in 1936; before that he concentrated on composition and conducting, founding the Toynbee Hall Orchestra in 1934. He worked with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) from 1941 to 1950.operas.com Among the works the BBC commissioned during his tenure was the Sinfonietta from French composer Francis Poulenc.Schmidt, 330. After he left the BBC, Lockspeiser focused on teaching and music journalism. In his teaching, Lockspeiser stressed the importance of understanding a composer's social and aesthetic background to gain a thorough understanding of his musical works. In his last work, he extended this principle to include the visual arts that may have influenced the composer. Lockspeiser's commitment to music and the visual arts was absolute; his wife Eleanore is quoted as saying that \\"art was the only important thing in our household\\" and their daughter, sculptor Mary Frank, has stated that she \\"was brought up to be an artist.\\"Meeker, \\"Mary Frank,\\" Jewish Women Encyclopedia. While he wrote some film music later in his career, the majority of Lockspeiser's musical compositions date from the 1920s. Only one work was published (Deux m√©lodies, Paris, 1926).

Franchitti led away at the start followed by Bryan Herta, although Paul Tracy soon passed Herta and took second. The Team Green duo of Franchitti and Tracy then pulled away from the field, building a lead of 12 seconds. After the first round of pitstops, Franchitti and Tracy stayed 1-2, but Juan Pablo Montoya was up to third after a quick stop. He was 15 seconds behind the Team Green cars, but he was unfazed by that and set about closing it down, and did so rapidly such that the top three cars were nose to tail before the second round of pitstops. Franchitti pitted, handing Tracy the lead, but that did not last for long as he was immediately passed by Montoya. Montoya and Tracy both made their second pitstops and both rejoined ahead of Franchitti, before a caution due to Luiz Garcia, Jr.'s spin bunched the field up. Tracy and Franchitti were quicker than anyone else on the track, but both were absolutely no match for Montoya, who set a stunning pace in the final stint once the track went green, and won by over 10 seconds. Tracy finished second and Franchitti third, which was enough for him to keep his championship lead, although it was down to 1 point. == Classification ==  Race  {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" - !

It rises in Quesques and flows into the English Channel at Boulogne- sur-Mer. Other communes along its length include: Selles, Brunembert, Bournonville, Alincthun, Cr√©marest, Wirwignes, Questrecques, Samer, Carly, Hesdigneul-l√®s-Boulogne, Isques, Saint-L√©onard, Hesdin-l'Abb√©, Condette, Saint-√âtienne-au-Mont, and Outreau. == Geography == The Liane flows for a length of 38.2 km. It rises at Quesques, then flows through the communes of Bournonville, Wirwignes, Questrecques, Carly, Hesdigneul, Isques and Saint- L√©onard. It finally flows into the English channel at Boulogne-sur-Mer. Before being fitted with canals and locks, the Liane estuary contributed directly to the fleuve marin c√¥tier which abuts the Picardy estuaries up to the location of the two capes. It has been proposed in one variation of the project that its estuary, although significantly transformed by technology, should be part of a putative natural park, the Parc naturel marin √† l'ouvert des estuaires picards et en mer d'Opale, a proposal in preparation since 2008 and submitted to public enquiry in 2011.  Morphology and tributaries  The average gradient of the Liane is 2.8 ‚Ä∞. Its tributaries include the following: { - valign=\\"top\\"  Right tributaries: * Lamy * Corette * Echinghem  Left tributaries: * Lottinghem * Vieil Moutier * Menneville * l'Edre * Desvres } ==Hydrology== The Liane is a very fast flowing river, but quite irregular. Its flow rate has been measured over a 27-year period (1965-1991), at Hesdigneul- l√®s-Boulogne near Boulogne-sur-Mer, a short way from its mouth.Banque Hydro - Station E5310210 - The Liane at Hesdigneul-l√®s-Boulogne (synthesis) (Don't tick the box \\"Station en service\\") The watershed of the river at that point is 196 km¬≤, or approximately 80% of its maximum value of 244 km¬≤). The mean interannual flow rate or discharge of the Liane at Hesdigneul-l√®s-Boulogne is 2.99 m¬≥/s. Just like its neighbour, the Wimereux, but unlike most Pas-de- Calais waterways, the Liane exhibits highly marked seasonal fluctuations. High waters occur at the end of autumn and in winter, characterised by monthly mean flow rates between 3.06 and 5.33 m¬≥/s, from November to March inclusive with a maximum in January. Low waters occur in summer, from June to September, with a decrease in monthly mean flow rate descending to 0.76 m¬≥/s in August. However variations in flow rate are much more pronounced over short periods or from year to year. _Mean monthly flow rate of the Liane (in m¬≥/s) measured at the Hesdigneul-l√®s-Boulogne hydrological station_ _over a period of 27 years_ Colors= id:lightgrey value:gray(0.8) id:darkgrey value:gray(0.3) id:sfondo value:rgb(1,1,1) id:barra value:rgb(0.6,0.8,0.9) ImageSize = width:600 height:280 PlotArea = left:40 bottom:40 top:20 right:20 DateFormat = x.y Period = from:0 till:6 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical AlignBars = justify ScaleMajor = gridcolor:lightgrey increment:2 start:0 ScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightgrey increment:1 start:0 BackgroundColors = canvas:sfondo BarData= bar:Jan text:Jan. bar:F√©v text:F√©b. bar:Mar text:March bar:Avr text:April bar:Mai text:May bar:Jun text:June bar:Jul text:July bar:Ao√ª text:Aug. bar:Sep text:Sep. bar:Oct text:Oct. bar:Nov text:Nov. bar:D√©c text:Dec.

Floods can be very significant considering the modest size of this small river and its watershed. The instantaneous maximal flowrate 2 (IMFR2) and IMFR5 metrics are 37 and 52 m¬≥ respectively. The IMFR10, or flow rate calculated from the ten-year flood, is 61 m¬≥/s, the IMFR20 is 70 m¬≥/s and the IMFR50 was 82 m¬≥/s. The maximum instantaneous flow rate recorded at Hesdigneul-l√®s-Boulogne during the 2-year measurement period was 47.3 m¬≥/s on 1 December 1979, while the maximum daily average flow rate was 41.6 m¬≥/s on 6 February 1988. Comparing the first of these values to the scale of the IMFR numbers, it becomes clear that the 1979 flood was hardly a 5-year event, and thus floods of this size are to be expected very frequently. The Liane is a very fast-flowing small river, fed heavily by the high rainfall in its watershed. The watershed runoff curve number is 483 mm annually, which is substantially larger than the average of France based on all its watersheds, as well as, for example, the average for the watershed of the neighbouring Lys which measures 249 mm at Wervicq-Sud. The specific flow rate reaches 15.3 litres per second per square kilometre of watershed. == Ecological status == Other than near its source, the Liane's water quality was mediocre to highly polluted during the years 1980-1990, mainly as a result of industrial and urban waste. Towns and industries are now polluting less, but ploughing has conquered land from farming and pasture which have been pushed back in this region, and farmland erosion and fields which are kept barren in winter and autumn are a cause of the Liane's almost constant turbidity. In 2005, the Liane remained turbid and its French water quality grade insatisfaisante (unsatisfactory),Catalogue of water agency analyses for the Artois/Nord/Picardie basin with too much nitrates and organic substances from Carly onwards, according to the water agency. At the mouth at Boulogne, the Liane's waters are graded as mauvaise (bad), with all the indicators being bad: macro-pollutants, organic and oxidizable substances, azot substances (nitrates) and phosphoric substances. The situation may be improved by the Water Framework Directive, and by the local Sch√©ma d'Am√©nagement et de Gestion des Eaux water management scheme. For some years a fishermen's association has, through various activities, attempted to make the Liane known other than for its reputation as being highly polluted; while this is true around Boulogne-sur-Mer, there are some places where the Liane is a picturesque river with swarms of fish. The Association des P√™cheurs de la Vall√©e de la Liane fishermen's association even regularly deposits wild trout (known as \\"farios\\") to repopulate the river and replace the fish which they have caught. == See also == * List of rivers of France == Notes  References  External links == Soci√©t√© de P√™che de Desvres * Banque Hydro - Station E5310210 la Liane √† Hesdigneul-l√®s-Boulogne (do not tick the box \\"Station en service\\") * Altlas of floodable zones of the Liane (downloadable) Category:Rivers of the Pas-de-Calais Category:Rivers of France Category:Rivers of Hauts-de-France 0Liane ","title":"Liane (river)"},{"id":"35238995","text":"State University of Makassar () is a public university in Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia.

Ecological niches include (but are not limited to) subtropical and tropical rain forests, wetlands, dry forests, scrublands, cloud forests, pine-fir forests in the highlands.

A global overview of their use and importance to people. FAO. Rome, Italy Moreover, many basidiomycetes and ascomycetes with conspicuous sporocarps often play an important role as ectomycorrhizal mycobionts of trees and shrubs of boreal forests in the northern hemisphere and are important elements in many areas of the southern hemisphere.Rinaldi AC, Comandini O, Kuyper TW 2008 - Ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity: separating the wheat from the chaff.

Most available observations pertain to the highlands, in the departments of Alta Verapaz, Baja Verapaz, Chimaltenango, Guatemala, El Quich√©, Huehuetenango, and Quetzaltenango, while the wide lowland Pet√©n region has been scantly explored, despite the fact that it accounts for about one third of Guatemala's area and, together with adjacent areas of Belize and southern Mexico, comprise the largest unbroken tract of tropical forest north of the Brazilian Amazon. At the order level, Agaricales was found to host the larger number of species (almost one third of the entire set), followed by Polyporales and Boletales. The most represented genera are Amanita, Russula, Lactarius, Laccaria, Suillus. Intriguingly, all these genera are ectomycorrhizal with the several Pinus and Quercus species that form extensive pine and mixed forests of the highlands, and/or with the endangered Abies guatemalensis (pinabete), most abundant between 2800‚Äì3200 m elevation on the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes in western Guatemala.Vivero JL, Szejner M, Gordon J, Magin V 2006 - The red list of trees of Guatemala.

The mushroom is named as ‚Äútzan tz‚Äôi‚Äù in Kaqchikel dialect, that means ‚Äúdog nose ‚Äù or ‚Äúchucho nose‚Äù because of ascostroma shape.

Many, but by no means all, edible species are identified through common vernacular names that have been sometimes recorded in several Maya languages. Generally, mushrooms are gathered and sold by women, often in family groups spanning three generations. Localities with more traditional knowledge, based on the number of species are used, were Tecp√°n (Chimaltenango) with 31 species, followed by San Juan Comalapa (Chimaltenango)and Totonicap√°n city (Totonicap√°n), with 22 species each.

Elvis Presley recorded the song on March 27, 1972 and released it as a single with \\"Always On My Mind\\" as the B-side. It reached gold status in the US for sales of over half a million copies. It was listed as a double sided hit reaching #16 on Billboard magazines Hot Country Singles chart in November 1972. In the UK \\"Always On My Mind\\" was the hit song and \\"Separate Ways\\" was the B-side. ==Song information== Richard Mainegra had the following to say about the song. \\"It's a big understatement to say getting an Elvis cut was the highlight of my career. At the time, I was only 22 and right out of Slidell into the music business. I was very excited to be doing what I'd always wanted to do. I'd only had about three songs cut so far --- the Yellow Pages, Gary Puckett, and Pat Boone. I had stars in my eyes, but I wasn't prepared for what was about to happen. Red West, who co-wrote the song, was one of the 'Memphis Mafia' ‚Äì Elvis' bodyguards and buddies. At the time, he was heading the publishing company I happened to stumble into a year earlier. One day I had a melody going that Red really liked, so he began writing lyrics to it. Before long, he had a look of real excitement in his eyes as if he knew we had something special going. We started leaning the story line toward Elvis' break-up with Priscilla and how it affected their daughter. He told me when it was finished Elvis was going to cut the song. I let that go in one ear and out the other. I thought, 'No way!' First of all, why would Elvis want to sing about his personal life that was already being dragged through the media every day? And, secondly, there was no way little ole 'small town, green me' was going to get a song cut by the one artist every songwriter in the world wanted to sing their song! Red telephoned me one night a few months later and played a rough cut of the recording ‚Äì I was actually listening to ELVIS PRESLEY singing the song that I had co-written! I've never been higher in my life than at that moment! We eventually got word that our song would definitely be on an album. Sometimes you get a song cut, but it never makes the final 10 or 12 songs that actually go on an album. A few months later, after we all had moved to Nashville, we got word that it was going to be the flip side of the single Always on My Mind. How cool that was!!! A few weeks later, we were informed Separate Ways was going to be released as a pop single. I've had cuts by some pretty major artists since then, but nothing has ever matched the feeling I had when I first heard 'The King' sing a song of which I was lucky to be a part!\\" In 1973, Andre Kostelanetz and His Orchestra covered \\"Separate Ways\\" on his album, Last Tango in Paris. ==References== Category:Elvis Presley songs Category:1972 singles Category:Songs written by Red West Category:Songs written by Richard Mainegra Category:1972 songs Category:RCA Records singles ","title":"Separate Ways (Elvis Presley song)"},{"id":"35239382","text":"The University of Toronto Mississauga is a satellite campus of the University of Toronto. It is in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada about 33 kilometres west of the main St. George campus. It was formerly called the Erindale College but was later changed to the University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM). The campus has eight main educational buildings: the newly opened Maanjiwe nendamowinan Building, Deerfield Hall, the William G. Davis Building (formerly known as the South Building), the Kaneff Centre and Blackwood Gallery, the Recreation, Athletic, and Wellness Centre, the Hazel McCallion Academic Learning Centre which holds UTM's library, the Instructional Building, and the new Terrence Donnelly Health Sciences Complex for the Mississauga Academy of Medicine. The campus also houses 3 residence halls: Erindale Hall, Roy Ivor Hall, and Oscar Peterson Hall. ==North Building== The North Building was the original educational building for UTM, formerly known as Erindale College. Construction for the North Building began in 1966. It was originally intended to be temporary and to be used for administrative purposes. Classes in the building began for the 1967 school year, with 155 students, 28 faculty, and 40 staff. Since then numerous additions and remodels have been made to the building. Today the only part of the original structure that remains is the cafeteria and some classrooms of the first floor. The building is now home to the Department of Humanities. Room capacities range from 48-person classrooms to a 200-person lecture hall and the cafe contains Coyote Jacks, Pita Pit, Tim Hortons and Mr. Sub vendors. The North Building was demolished in 2015 and the New North building (which was later renamed to Maanjiwe nednamowinan) was opened in 2018. ==William G. Davis Building (South Building)== Since it first opened in 1973, the South Building has undergone several renovations. The University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM) is situated by the west bank of the Credit River. This made it an idyllic location to start constructing what architect Raymond Moriyama called the \\"UTM Campus Master Plan\\" in 1967. That year, the North Building was created as a temporary academic facility which marked the beginning of Erindale College. As this building was only meant to serve as a temporary shelter, Moriyama originally thought that there would be one central building that would hold all academic facilities, thus preserving the natural state of the campus. The idea of creating this \\"mega-structure\\" lead to the development of the South Building. It was then constructed, and in 1973, the South Building was opened on the UTM campus. Since then however, the South Building has undergone major reconstruction. UTM has experienced \\"a period of rapid growth with an enrolment increase of approximately 71%.\\" With such a significant increase in the population, the campus had to naturally meet the demands of this growth. Five buildings have been constructed from 2000 to 2007 in order to support this growth, one of which have been an extension onto the South Building: the Recreation, Athletics and Wellness Centre. Another major building that was constructed in 2006, to facilitate such change was the Hazel McCallion Academic Learning Centre (HMALC) which now functions as a library. Prior to this, the second and third floor of the South Building were used as the campus's library. With the creation of the HMALC, 5,800 square meters became free to expand the building further. A \\"phased approach\\" was taken for the renovations as this allowed them to tackle the re- allocation and construction of the South Building sequentially. According to Kearns Mancini Architect inc., the firm that took on the first phase of renovations for South Building, the project was valued at $6 million. They renovated 32,000 square meters of the building, and completed it in 2009. Kearns Mancini converted the library into a space for extra classrooms, faculty, and administrative offices. Both Departments of Sociology and Geography, campus police services, and offices for executive faculty have been allocated to this section. The architects renovated with the goal of achieving a LEED Gold rating. This led them to put environmental sustainability at the forefront of their architectural design. The renovated portion of the South Building exploits natural light as a way to further the model of environmental sustainability. There are domed skylights to increase the amount of sunlight in the building as well as clerestory skylights which are designed to trap in heat for the winter, and keep heat out for the summer. These environmental innovations are a reflection of UTM's \\"Grow Smart, Grow Green\\" mentality. ==Kaneff Centre== The Kaneff Centre was built in 1992, to house the political science, economics, commerce and management programs. The Kaneff Centre, named after Bulgarian-born Canadian businessman, construction magnate and philanthropist Ignat Kaneff, was constructed in 1992 to house the political science, economics, commerce and management programs. Its lecture halls range from 53 persons-limit halls to the campuses second largest lecture theatre courtesy of additional philanthropy from the Matthews Family. Matthews Auditorium seats up to 352 students. In 2010, the political science department moved to the William Davis Building. Blackwood Gallery The Kaneff Centre also holds UTM's own art gallery: the Blackwood Gallery. Its main space is within the Kaneff Centre but additional gallery space can be found in the egallery, on the ground floor of the CCT building. The Blackwood Gallery is also in charge of the Bernie Miller Lightbox outside the South Building. The Blackwood Gallery curates the work of local, national, and international professional artists. Every year the Blackwood Gallery will hold approximately five exhibitions, consisting of on-site and off-site exhibitions, and graduating student shows. Other than exhibitions and shows, the Blackwood Gallery also presents publications, public lectures, symposia, and conferences. During the summer months, the Blackwood Gallery holds a contemporary arts summer day camp for children ages 5‚Äì12. The summer camp is named ‚ÄúRunning With Scissors.‚Äù  Innovation Complex  The rotunda of the Innovation Complex The Innovation complex was opened in September 2014 as an expansion to the Kaneff Centre. The expansion provided 6,300 square metres (67, 800 sq ft) of additional space and placed a large rotunda in the middle of the Kaneff Centre. The expansion cost $35 million, $10 million of which came from a grant from the city of Mississauga. The Innovation Complex is certified as LEED Silver. == Erindale Hall == Erindale Hall is a residence hall that was completed in August 2003 on a budget of $11.5 million. The hall is located centrally along the 5 minute walk, between Deerfield Hall and the Student Centre. Currently, the hall is set up in apartment style housing, with suites of 4 rooms, each housing two people. During the construction of Maanjiwe nendamowinan the second and third floors of the residence hall were used as office space and housed the Departments of English & Drama, Language Studies, and Historical Studies. ==Recreation, Athletic, and Wellness Centre (RAWC)== The Recreation Athletic and Wellness Centre (RAWC) is a membership university-based facility. The facility is at the University of Toronto Mississauga campus, which is positioned at 3359 Mississauga Rd. North in Mississauga Ontario. The RAWC opened up in September 2006. The facility is 73,000 square feet. The facility offers a variety of activities and advancements from the previous used space, such as: a 25-metre lane, 8 lane pool, 12 person hot pool, double gymnasium with seating for 880 spectators/fans, new fitness centre, new studio, indoor running track and a sports medicine clinic. ==Communication, Culture and Technology Building (CCT)== Most of the CCT Building's exterior walls are made of glass. The Communication, Culture and Technology (CCT) building is one of the new buildings at the University of Toronto, Mississauga. It is near the center of the campus between the Student Centre and the McCallion Academic learning Centre and Library. The building covers up to 10, 800 square meters or 1123,819 square feet of space. The exterior walls are mainly constructed out of glass making the outside visible from the inside. The architectural design of the interior is meant to reflect the contemporary studies that the CCT building was made to house. The offices and classrooms are mostly facing the park or the courtyard garden The building is used by the University of Toronto and Sheridan College as they have joint programs together. The main academic programs that use the CCT building are: Communication, Culture and Information Technology (CCIT), Professional Writing and Communication (PWC), the Centre for Visual and Media Culture (CVMC), Biomedical Communications (BMC) and Digital Enterprise Management (DEM). Inside of the CCT building there is research and support space as well as lecture halls. There are also classrooms, laboratories, undergraduate teaching as well as academic and administrative offices and student services available inside. CCT is also home to the Multimedia Studio Theatre or MiST and The E-Gallery. The building cost 35 million dollars and was funded by City of Mississauga, Canada Foundation for Innovation, Government of Ontario, Ontario Innovation Trust, University Infrastructure Investment Fund, Access to Opportunities Programs and U of T Enrolment Growth Funds. It also received private support from GE Canada, Hitachi Canada, and The Mississauga Board of Chinese Professionals and Businesses (CPB). The CCT building was designed by Saucier + Perrotte architects, structurally engineered by Quinn Dressel and Mechanically and electrically engineered by Rybka, Smith and Ginsler. The project began in 2004. In 2008 it was awarded a Governor General's Medal in Architecture. ==Hazel McCallion Academic Learning Centre (UTM Library)== The Hazel McCallion Academic Learning Centre is in the University of Toronto Mississauga. In other words, it is called the library and functions as a study space. The construction for the new library began in November 3, 2004. The opening date for the Hazel McCallion Academic Learning Centre was in October, 2006. The library's dimensions are 10,075 gross square metres/ (per) 108,500 square feet. Study rooms are located on each floor and can be booked through the library website. The companies and organizations that have funded this particular projects are: Government of Ontario, U of T Enrolment Growth Fund, and Student Library Enhancement Fund. Alas, there has been multiple other companies that have contributed and supported this project, such as: RBC Financial Group, Biovail Corporation International, and Rotary Clubs of Mississauga. == Oscar Peterson Hall (OPH) == Oscar Peterson Hall was opened in 2007 as a residence hall at the university. Located adjacent to Erindale hall, OPH is a focal point for students living on campus. Student mail distribution occurs at Oscar Peterson Hall, and resident services are located in the hall. OPH is also the location of Coleman Commons, the only traditional style dining hall at the university. All student housing rooms in Oscar Peterson Hall are single bedroom dormitories. ==Instructional Building (IB)== The construction of the Instructional Building was spurred from the doubling of student enrolment since the early 2000s. In response to the doubling of student enrolment over the past decade, the UTM campus building infrastructure has continued to expand to meet growing enrollment needs. The construction of the Instructional Centre, also known as the Instructional Building (IB), had plans drawn out in 2002. Located next to the Hazel McCallion Academic Learning Centre and Library on the north side at the end of the campus's outer circle road, the Instructional Building covers a total of of space spread out throughout its three stories. The much-innovated construction of the IB building is composed of green patinated copper strips aiming in a vertical direction continuing inside the building, adding to the physical appearance of the facility. The use of the copper panels increases classroom space by 50% and increases the use of green infrastructure by 60%. UTM's Instructional building includes geothermal heating and cooling systems under the nearby football field as well as awnings with thin photovoltaic cells which contribute to shade on the south side of the building. Other renewable energy ideas were also included in the construction of the building such as the inclusion of green roofs and reflective membranes which play a big role in the reduction of urban heat as well as energy and water-efficient lighting and fixtures. The building has been considered as a LEED silver-certified project and will soon be certified as LEED Gold. In addition, the building contains many windows, which enable much light to enter which creates a warm and friendly atmosphere for students. The construction of the Instructional centre and the new Health and Science complex has led to an enduring loss of 450 parking spaces. However, the project has opened a new window of opportunity for students and staff since it provides and accommodates up to 2,500 students simultaneously. Included in this newly built structure are auditorium or lecture halls containing as many as 500 students respectively. In addition, the structure also offers study rooms meant for more individual study time. The study rooms are significantly smaller than lecture halls and are able to accommodate 30 students. Also included in this structure is a 24/7 computer lab with an average of 50 computers. Throughout the entire building, the classrooms and lab rooms are equipped with e-connected spaces using newly digital technology which encourages students in their learning process. In addition, this facility includes lounges through its three stories as well as a caf√© (Second cup) with seating area, as well as a patio where students are able to connect to the internet using their portable devices. The IB averaged 70 million dollars in order for its construction to commence. The Instructional Building was funded by both the federal and provincial governments. In doing its part, the federal government spent 35 million dollars in collaboration with the Knowledge Infrastructure Program. The provincial government has invested an additional 35 million in corresponding to the contribution from Queen's Park in its budget of 2009. The Instructional centre was designed by Shore Tilbe Perkins+ Will, now known as Perkins+Will Canada. The design and the technological ideas involved in the production of the Instructional Building at the University of Toronto at the Mississauga campus won the Award of Excellence at the 30th annual Mississauga Urban Design Awards competition. The Instructional Building opened its doors in August 2011 and was presented with this award on November 22 in Mississauga City Hall. ==Terrence Donnelly Health Sciences Complex== The Health Sciences Complex opened in November 2011. The Terrence Donnelly Health Sciences Complex is the University of Toronto Mississauga's newest educational building. The new building houses the Mississauga Academy of Medicine, the department of Biomedical Communications and the department of Anthropology and Forensics. The TDHSC building was designed by Kongats Architects Toronto. Funding for the new building was provided by Carlo Fidani, Terrence Donnelly, and the Provincial Government. Carlo Fidani donated $10 million for building costs, scholarships, and a chair in family and community medicine. Terrence Donnelly donated $12 million to building costs and scholarships. Capital funding for the project of $30.3 million was provided by the Provincial Government. The construction for the 5,960 square meter (64,153 square feet), four-story building began the summer of 2009. The building officially opened on November 1, 2011. The ‚Äústacked box‚Äù design building is built on a slope on the outer campus Drive Ring. The building was originally planned to have a steel structural framing but because of rising steel prices the structural framing had to be switched to concrete for the final design development. The lower cost of concrete framing meant that the custom stainless steel ‚Äúskin‚Äù could be developed within the University of Toronto's budget requirements. The building's exterior had two ‚Äúskins,‚Äù the main ‚Äúskin‚Äù is insulated and waterproof while the separate exterior steel panel ‚Äúskin‚Äù reflected heat. Inside the building are state-of-the-art classrooms, seminar rooms, computer facilities, learning spaces and laboratories. There is also a student lounge and unique outdoor terrace for students to relax and socialize. Kongats Architects Toronto's principal Alar Kongats said on an e-mail interview, ‚ÄúThe TDHSC is designed to achieve a North American LEED Gold sustainability designation.‚Äù. The building has subsequently received a 2012 Governor General's Medal in Architecture. A jury comment described it as \\"A large institutional building (that) is articulated and humanised by skillful massing and the inventive treatment of the facade. A cladding system of shimmering metal fins animates the stacked box arrangement of volumes, and gives the building a distinctive set-piece quality amid its campus neighbours. Interiors are luminous and civilised with ample natural light, and the sliding stacked volumes create terraces for encounter and engagement. The quality of detailing is exceptional and the sophisticated use of materials lifts the building into a class of its own.\\" Situated in the TDHSC is The Mississauga Academy of Medicine. The Mississauga Academy of Medicine is a partnership between U of T Mississauga, U of T's Faculty of Medicine, Trillium Health Centre and Credit Valley Hospital. In August 2011, The Mississauga Academy of Medicine welcomed 54 students to its first year class and expects to have 216 students enrolled in the four-year program by 2014. == Deerfield Hall (DH) == Deerfield Hall opened in 2014 Deerfield Hall was opened in September 2014 and is 4 stories tall. The building, along with renovations to the Davis Building, cost $75 million, 70% of which was funded by the Government of Ontario. The building houses the offices and labs for the Department of Mathematical and Computational Sciences as well as the offices for the Department of Psychology. The hall is LEED Silver certified. == Maanjiwe nendamowinan (MN) == Maanjiwe nendamowinan opened in September 2018. The Maanjiwe nendamowinan building, abbreviated MN, is the newest building at UTM, and was built in place of the demolished North building. The building was opened in September 2018 as the New North building. On August 22, 2019, the university announced that the building would be renamed to Maanjiwe nendamowinan after consulting with the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation. The name means \\"gathering of minds\\" in the Anishinaabemowin language. Maanjiwe nendamowinan has a floor space of 20,500 square metres (220,600 sq ft) and is six stories tall. The building has two active learning classrooms and houses the Departments of English & Drama, Historical Studies, Language Studies, Philosophy, Political Science, and Sociology. ==References== Mississauga Educational Buildings ","title":"University of Toronto Mississauga buildings"},{"id":"35239384","text":"Frances L.

Listed at , 155 lb, she batted and threw right-handed.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2000. Format: Hardcover, 294pp. Language: English. The tall, red-haired Frances Janssen was a well-traveled pitcher during her five-year career in the AAGPBL, as she moved constantly from one city to another because the league office shifted players to help teams stay competitive. Janssen also was cut twice from the league, but she kept playing for seven different teams without complaint, even if from different periods of time and different stays. Born in Remington, Indiana, Frances was the daughter of Fred and Anna (n√©e Petersen) Janssen, whom emigrated from Germany in the mid-1910s and settled in the farmlands of Indiana. She had a brother, Paul, and four sisters, Betty, Tinie, Wilma and Anna. Almost six feet tall, Frances played basketball and organized softball while attending Gilboa High School. She later received an associate degree in business from South Bend IUPUI and attended International Business College of Fort Wayne. She graduated in 1944 and immediately went to work in an office.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Softcover, 295 pp. Language: English. By the time, several girls from her local softball team had been scouted and signed by the league. Frances gave it a try out in 1946 but she did not made the grade. She then insisted again in 1948 and was accepted. After spring training, she was assigned to the South Bend Blue Sox for a couple of days before being sent to the Grand Rapids Chicks. She went 4‚Äì4 with a 3.98 earned run average in 11 games and was released after one month of action. I got released because I couldn't throw a curveball, she recalled in an interview.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League But Janssen did not give up, and accepted a demotion to the Chicago Colleens/Springfield Sallies rookie touring teams to work things out. The Colleens and the Sallies had lost their franchises after their poor performance the previous year. Both teams played exhibition games against each other as they travelled primarily through the South and East, traveling through 20 states and played in 46 cities. We traveled more than 10,000 miles in 1949 from Illinois to Texas, across the Gulf states and up to New Jersey and Pennsylvania, she later explained in an interview with Jim Sargent for the Society for American Baseball Research. We played in minor league parks in Tulsa and Baltimore, as well as in city parks, and we drew good crowds. In two of those games, she was asked to switch to the Sallies and serve as playing manager as well as chaperone. She handled both jobs well while also leading her Colleens team in pitching. By the way, she came along fine and hurled two one-hitter shutouts against Springfield at Oklahoma and South Carolina ballparks. She finished the tour with a 16‚Äì6 record in 23 pitching appearances. Nevertheless, since the league counted the whole tour as exhibition games, no official statistics were kept. Janssen was promoted to the Peoria Redwings in 1950 and ended up pitching for the Fort Wayne Daisies in the postseason. She went 3‚Äì3 with a 3.87 ERA in 19 games for Peoria and Fort Wayne, and pitched 12 innings of shutout ball without a decision in three playoff games, even though the Daisies lost to the Rockford Peaches in the best-of-seven final round.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book She opened the 1951 season with Fort Wayne and returned to Peoria early in the year, which made her feel like the end of the world, according to her own words. Then she was sent to the Kalamazoo Lassies during the midseason and finished the year with the Battle Creek Belles. Through her lengthy and arduous journey, Jannsen posted a career-best 26 games pitched, only six behind Belles teammate Migdalia P√©rez, while also setting career-highs in ERA (2.67), innings pitched (145) and strikeouts (43). She had a very good season overall, although this was not reflected in her 6‚Äì10 losing record. Jannsen spent the entire 1952 season with Battle Creek and was used in relief duties, a seldom used role in the league. She appeared in only five games, going 0‚Äì1 with a 5.00 ERA in 18 innings of work. Following her baseball days, Janssen played center for the South Bend Rockettes women's basketball team and volleyball with the South Bend Turners for more than a decade. She helped the Rockettes win five national championships and won a national champion title with the Turners. She also was an insurance representative for Laven Insurance Company in South Bend during 25 years and retired in 1991. Besides this, she became an avid golfer and attended AAGPBL Players Association reunions. In addition, she helped the association research information for the league's archives at the Northern Indiana Historical Society, of which she was an active member. The association was largely responsible for the opening of Women in Baseball, a permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled in 1988 to honor the entire All- American Girls Professional Baseball League. Frances Janssen spent her entire life in her home state of Indiana. After moving from her native Remington to South Bend, she lived in Lafayette, where she died of natural causes in 2008 at the age of 82. ==Career statistics== Pitching { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #F9F9F9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size:100%;\\" - align=center style=\\"background: #F2F2F2;\\" !GP!!W!!L!!W-L%!!ERA!!IP!!H!!RA!!ER!!BB!!SO!!HBP!!WP!!WHIP -align=center  61  13  18  .419  3.74  289  283  178  120  143  67  13  11  1.47 } Batting { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #F9F9F9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size:100%;\\" - align=center style=\\"background: #F2F2F2;\\" !GP!!AB!!R!!H!!2B!!3B!!HR!!RBI!!SB!!BB!!SO!!BA!!OBP -align=center  61  105  6  17  3  0  0  5  0  7  18  .162  .229 } Fielding { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"9\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #F9F9F9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size:100%;\\" - align=center style=\\"background: #F2F2F2;\\" !GP!!PO!!A!!E!!TC!!DP!!FA -align=center  61  7  129  4  140  1  .938 } ==References== Category:All-American Girls Professional Baseball League players Category:South Bend Blue Sox players Category:Grand Rapids Chicks players Category:Chicago Colleens players Category:Peoria Redwings players Category:Kalamazoo Lassies players Category:Fort Wayne Daisies players Category:Battle Creek Belles players Category:American people of German-Jewish descent Category:Baseball players from Indiana Category:Indiana University ‚Äì Purdue University Indianapolis alumni Category:People from Remington, Indiana Category:Sportspeople from South Bend, Indiana Category:1926 births Category:2008 deaths ","title":"Frances Janssen"},{"id":"35239404","text":"Takov√° norm√°ln√≠ rodinka (Just an Ordinary Family) was a Czechoslovak television programme which was first broadcast in 1971.

Political climate  Takov√° norm√°ln√≠ rodinka was written as a contemporary series whose characters were to put up with problems of that time. 1971 in Czechoslovakia was a period of normalization (tightened-up phase of the communist reign in the republic, that followed 1968 Russian invasion). Screenplays for each episode were subject for censorship, and the pressure put on authors to engage more with the communistic ideology resulted in discontinuation of the series after the eight episode.http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/kultura/117984-takova-normalni- rodinka-nasadila-latku-vysoko/ Examples of that include a children's party that had to involve so called pioneers (of the socialist union of youth), or a foreign business trip that had to be to Cuba. One of the supporting roles, written for Pavel Landovsk√Ω, had to be taken over by different actor, for political repressions against Landovsk√Ω. == Characters == * Granny (Marie Ros≈Ølkov√°), author of detective stories, none of which were ever published; obsessed with ways of committing a murder, trying that on other family members * Mother Cilka (Dana Med≈ôick√°), a cook, works in RaJ (restaurants & diners); likes to sing opera arias; keen to uphold the family reputation * Father Old≈ôich (Zdenƒõk ≈òeho≈ô), train dispatcher, loves animals, keeps two turtles, mice and a snake at home * Their elder daughter Pavla (Jana ≈†tƒõp√°nkov√°), yoga exerciser * P√©≈•a, Pavla's husband, his favourite activities is reading or sleeping on a couch, dodging as many household duties as possible * Petr and Pavel, also referred to as raub√≠≈ôi (rascals), Pavla's and P√©≈•a's vibrant kids * K√°ƒça, Pavla's younger sister; works in OPBH (approx.

XDN, is a French jazz musician, percussionist and drummer. ==Youth== Xavier Desandre Navarre was born in Paris. He spends a great part of his childhood between Paris and the southern French city of Aix-en-Provence, but a year spent with his family in Iran that awakened his passion for the variety of rhythms offered by percussions. Back in France, in 1975, he starts learning music academically by studying classical percussion at Aix-en-Provence music conservatory. In the meantime, he also learnt Brazilian rhythms and percussion, from samba to candomble, with Sylvio de Santana Jr. and Brazilian musicologist and conductor Nicia Ribas d'Avila. He started playing jazz, and improvising on African and Cuban music. His musical philosophy is to create bridges between these different styles. ==Career== In 1987, Xavier Desandre Navarre moved to Paris and begins his career with musician Laurent Cugny in the Big Band Lumi√®re for a European tour with Gil Evans. In 1991, he joined the National Jazz Orchestra directed by Denis Badault. In the same time, he leads a hyperproductive jazz and variety sideman career. Between 1991 and 2012, Xavier Desandre Navarre directs or takes part in more than 150 CDs and recordings, some of which are gold records or have received prestigious distinctions. The latest one was recorded with Korean singer Youn Sun Nah, and was nominated best French jazz album in 2010 and Gold CD in Germany in 2011. Xavier Desandre Navarre develops a very specific musical identity by the eclectic rhythms he harmonizes with his voice. Along his career, he is the guest of the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra, and plays with such musicians as Manu Dibango, Yaron Herman, David Sanborn, John Scofield, Didier Lockwood or Stefano di Battista. He is also particularly appreciated by scandinavian musicians with whom he records many projects. In this, he plays with guitarist Ulf Wakenius, Niels Lan Doky, Lars Danielsson and singer Caecillie Norby. Equally at ease with the intimacy of jazz and with the superproductions of the electronic scene, he give a live gig with French electro music icon Laurent Garnier, at the Salle Pleyel in Paris in 2010, and later plays the same project for two consecutive nights at the Grand Palais. He also takes part in many shows and performances, as he did for the French Turkish in 2009, by giving a concert at the Jardin des Tuileries in Paris. In 2010, he played in a show called Story of Earth and Waterhttp://www.unesco.org/mab/doc/iyb/concert.pdf created for the UNESCO. In 2012, he will present his latest solo project Beat, body and soul at the Lyon opera house. At the same time he presents two more creations at the Lyon opera house, United Nations of Groove ( Black music & Jazz) quartet with singer Allonymous and visual designer Tekyes, and In-Pulse acoustic jazz quartet. In 1998, he composed music for the opening ceremony of the football World Cup in Paris and took part in the creation of the independent production label Peak Power in 1999. Navarre also composes scores, as he did for Luc Besson's film L√©on, starring Jean Reno in 1994, or for Menno Meyjes's Manolete starring Pen√©lope Cruz and Adrien Brody in 2008. All along his career, he also composed many scores for TV documentaries, for Canal+, Arte and France T√©l√©vision. More recently, in 2011, he acted the part of a jazz musician in a film dealing with the life of Pierre Goldman. ==Chronology (non-exhaustive)== * 1987/88 : Gil Evans & Big Band Lumi√®re Dir¬∞ Laurent Cugny : European Tour and recording of 2 albums. * 1991 / 1994 : Orchestre National de Jazz Dir¬∞ Denis Badault : European Tour and recording of 3 albums. * 1992 : Creation of Solo project : \\" Tribalmopolite \\" at the Blue Suberbs Festival. * 1993 : Charlie Haden & Liberation Orchestra, Concerts at the Blue Suberbs Festival. * 1994 : Les Rita Mitsouko : French tour and promotion of the \\" Systeme D \\" album. * 1994 : Iwao Furusawa : Japanese and European tours. * 1994 : Niels Lan Doky, Caecilie Norby, Lars Danielsson, World tours and concerts.

After moving to the United States she attended Brown University, Providence earning M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Sociology. ==Career== Prema Kurien was Visiting Assistant Professor at the Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Knox College, from 1992 to 1994, then Assistant Professor at the Department of Sociology and Director of the Human Diversity Program at Chapman University from 1994 to 1995. From 1995 to 2003 she was Assistant Professor at the Department of Sociology, University of Southern California, then obtained her present position of Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology of Syracuse University. She has received post-doctoral fellowships and grants from the Carnegie Corporation, The Pew Charitable Trusts, the American Institute of Indian Studies and the Louisville Institute.

She has published many articles in peer-reviewed journals. Prema Kurien's books are: * * Her Kaleidoscopic Ethnicity is primarily an anthropological work. It investigates the ways in which Malayali migrants from three different Kerala communities handle the opportunities and challenges of working in the Gulf. Three villages are studied, one predominantly Muslim, one Hindu and one Christian. She shows how the different cultures of these three villages were shaped by their historical experience, and how they profoundly influenced the way in which the villagers coped with the new challenges. In A Place at the Multicultural Table Kurien reviews the ways in which Hindu American organizations are trying to address the question of cultural identity for Hindu Americans, including immigrants and those born in the US. She looks at the emerging \\"American Hinduism\\", an organized, standardized and politicized version of the more diverse Hinduism of India. Kurien makes the point that most American Hindus have no connection to the small group of ideologues who lead Hindutva-related organisations in the US, but few actively oppose the Hindutva movement. The vast majority are silent, falling between the extremes. ==References== Category:American sociologists Category:Women scientists from Kerala Category:Living people Category:Syracuse University faculty Category:1963 births ","title":"Prema Kurien"},{"id":"35239746","text":"Shine On! Songs Volume One is a charity compilation album by various artists including Maxi Priest, Tierney Sutton, Julian Lennon, Rie fu, Mark Ballas, Monday Michiru, Donna Burke and others which was released 30 September 2011, in support of the Tyler Foundation for childhood cancer in Japan and December 2011, internationally via iTunes Store. The album received support worldwide and media attention in Japan and elsewhere that included Yahoo! News, The Dallas Morning News and Rolling Stone. ==History== The album was recorded both in the United States at Capitol Studios and also in Japan. Shine On! Songs Volume One was a brainchild of the Tyler Foundation which created the musical collaboration as a way of raising funds for the organizations programs. A number of artists donated songs to the album including Julian Lennon who donated 'Children of the World' to be a track on the album. It was also announced on Mark Ballas and several other contributing artists websites in late 2011. Rolling Stone first reported that Julian Lennon was donating his 1993 song 'Children of the World' to be a track on the album. However, one issue that received public attention was Julian Lennon's criticism of an Examiner.com article after publishing several details wrong. Lennon blasted the journalist responsible on both his website and Facebook page until the article was corrected. During production students at Sakari Elementary School in Ofunato City, Japan participated in the chorus of one of the songs on the CD, \\"Who I Want to Be\\". The song is based on an English version of Miyazawa Kenji's famous poem \\"Ame Ni Mo Makezu\\". Recording artist Rie fu, who sang the song, visited Sakari Elementary school to share in the happiness of completing the song.\\"'Ame Ni Mo Makezu' With Strength\\". Tohkai Shimpo. 24 August 2011.\\"Sakari Elementary School's Chorus on CD\\". Tohkai Shimpo. 1 November 2011. \\"Children of the World\\" was also released on the soundtrack for the Japanese animated film Coo.

He started an apprenticeship with the club during the summer of 2008 and his good form for the youth team earned him a call-up for the first team squad, being named on the bench for Gillingham's FA Cup game against Aston Villa in January 2009. Rance finished the 2009‚Äì10 season as the youth team's top goalscorer, and in May 2010 signed his first professional contract with the club. However, his opportunities in the first team were limited in the 2010‚Äì11 season by a foot injury sustained during a pre-season friendly. Despite this, he impressed during loan spells with non-League sides Maidstone United and Bishop's Stortford. He signed a new one-year contract with Gillingham ahead of the 2011‚Äì12 season, during which he made his first team debut as a substitute in an FA Cup first round replay against Bournemouth in November 2011. Rance was loaned out to Conference South side Dover Athletic on a one-month loan on 2 March 2012. He was released by Gillingham in May 2012 and signed a permanent contract with Dover. Ahead of the 2013‚Äì14 season, Rance signed for Ebbsfleet United. Rance quickly established himself as a fan favourite at Stonebridge Road and was named players' player of the season despite being sent off in the play-off final second leg at Bromley and thus missing the play-off final against his former club, Dover. ==Career statistics== { class=  + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=2Club !rowspan=2Season !colspan=3League !colspan=2FA Cup !colspan=2League Cup !colspan=2Other !colspan=2Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=4Gillingham 2009‚Äì10 League One 0000000000 - 2010‚Äì11 League Two 0010000010 - 2011‚Äì12 League Two 0000000000 - !colspan=2Total !0!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0 - rowspan=3Bishop's Stortford (loan) 2010‚Äì11 Conference South 73colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî73 - 2011‚Äì12 Conference North 80colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî80 - !colspan=2Total !15!!3!!colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî!!15!!3 - Dover Athletic (loan) 2011‚Äì12 Conference South 20colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî20 - rowspan=2Dover Athletic 2012‚Äì13 Conference South 35020colspan=2‚Äî5Three appearances in Conference South play-offs, two in FA Trophy0420 - !colspan=2Total !37!!0!!2!!0colspan=2‚Äî5!!0!!44!!0 - rowspan=7Ebbsfleet United 2013‚Äì14 Conference South 37340colspan=2‚Äî6Two appearances in Conference South play-offs, four in FA Trophy0473 - 2014‚Äì15 Conference South 18120colspan=2‚Äî4Appearances in FA Trophy0241 - 2015‚Äì16 National League South 37020colspan=2‚Äî50440 - 2016‚Äì17 National League South 39220colspan=2‚Äî7Three appearances and one goal in National League South play-offs, four in FA Trophy1483 - 2017‚Äì18 National League 34330colspan=2‚Äî4Two appearances in National League play-offs, two in FA Trophy0393 - 2018‚Äì19 National League 28010colspan=2‚Äî10300 - !colspan=2Total !193!!9!!14!!0colspan=2‚Äî27!!1!!234!!10 - Aldershot Town 2019‚Äì20 National League 31210colspan=2‚Äî10332 - Dagenham & Redbridge 2020‚Äì21 National League 2000colspan=2‚Äî0020 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career totals !278!!14!!18!!0!!0!!0!!33!!1!!329!!15 } ==ReferencesCategory:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Maidstone Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Gillingham F.C. players Category:Maidstone United F.C. players Category:Bishop's Stortford F.C. players Category:Dover Athletic F.C. players Category:Ebbsfleet United F.C. players Category:Aldershot Town F.C. players Category:Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. players Category:National League (English football) players ","title":"Dean Rance"},{"id":"35239908","text":"Zygaena afghana is a species of moth in the Zygaenidae family.

Building works were commenced and continued with slow progress, and the unfinished church was first used to hold Mass in 1842. The church was then dedicated to saints Peter and Paul a year later.http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/places/cathedrl.htm Development of the church largely stopped during the Great Famine, but afterwards works to the interior design of the church were undertaken. The tower and spire of the church were completed in 1874. The parish church was elevated to pro-cathedral status in 1889, with the Bishop taking residence in Ennis. left In 1890, Thomas J. McRedmond became the Bishop of Killaloe, and decided to base the bishopric at the church in Ennis. Thus, the parish church was designated as the pro-cathedral of the Diocese of Killaloe.http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/history-heritage/built- heritage-1700-today/buildings-of-ireland/clare/pro-cathedral-ennis/ In 1894, the main entrance of the cathedral was constructed, and extensive redecoration of the building was undertaken. In the 1930s, a new sacristy and chapter room were added to the building, and the present pipe organ and chapter stalls were installed. The cathedral was closed for six months in 1973, while work was undertaken to remodel the building to the requirements of the Second Vatican Council. The pipe organ was refurbished in 1985. The pro-cathedral was rededicated as a cathedral in 1990. After a fire in the cathedral in 1995, the sanctuary was rebuilt and the interiors were redecorated, with works completed at the end of 1996. ==References * Information on the Cathedral from Ennis parish Category:Buildings and structures in Ennis Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in the Republic of Ireland Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe Category:Churches in County Clare ","title":"Ennis Cathedral"},{"id":"35239925","text":"La Mout√®te was an indoor sporting arena located in Orthez, France, home of Elan Bearnais Orthez French basketball team from 1931 to 1991.

He was selected by the New York Rangers in the 4th round (100th overall) of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. He was the first hockey player raised in Florida to be drafted by the NHL. Prior NHL players who were born in Florida, but raised elsewhere include Val James, Dallas Eakins, Dan Hinote, and Blake Geoffrion. ==Playing career== Yogan played major junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey League.Whale Sign Forwards Andrew Yogan and Shayne Wiebe to ATOs - OurSports Central He was originally drafted by the Windsor Spitfires in 2007 in the 5th round of the OHL draft. He had been ranked 19th in the draft but fell because teams were concerned he was not interested in joining the OHL. He joined the Erie Otters in 2008. In the 2008‚Äì09 season, prior to becoming draft eligible, he suffered a concussion which may have caused him to slip in the draft. Prior to the concussion, some analysts considered him a potential first round draft pick. In 2009-10, Yogan scored 25 goals and 30 assists for 55 points for Erie. In 2010‚Äì11, he missed all but 10 games and the playoffs due to a shoulder injury. He was traded to the Peterborough Petes in 2011. For the 2011‚Äì12 season, Yogan was named OHL player of the week for the week of March 12‚Äì18, 2012, during which he scored four goals and four assists for eight points with a +8 plus-minus rating in his last three OHL games. For the season, Yogan finished 6th in the OHL with 41 goals and 15th in the OHL with 78 points. Yogan also believes that he made significant improvements in his defensive skills during the season. On March 21, 2012, the Connecticut Whale signed Yogan to an American Hockey League amateur tryout agreement,Whale Sign Andrew Yogan, Peter Ceresnak to ATOs - ctwhale.com: News and on March 26, 2012, Yogan was signed by the New York Rangers to a three-year two-way contract. He played two games for the Whale in 2011, scoring two goals and one assist. Both goals came in his pro debut on April 9, 2011. At the time he was drafted, Yogan regarded his hands and his shot as his best assets as a hockey player, and his speed as the biggest issue he needed to develop. His lack of speed may have been the result of starting playing hockey later than most legitimate prospects. On October 6, 2014 he was traded from the Rangers to the Florida Panthers organization along with Steven Kampfer in exchange for Joey Crabb. On September 10, 2015, Yogan returned to continue in the ECHL in signing a one-year contract with the Cincinnati Cyclones. After his fourth full professional year in North America, Yogan opted to pursue a European career, agreeing to a one-year contract with Italian club, HC Bolzano, who compete in the Austrian Hockey League on July 25, 2016. After 10 games with Bolzano, Yogan left to rejoin the Cincinnati Cyclones on October 18, 2016. In the 2016‚Äì17 season, Yogan continued to prove his offensive prowess in the ECHL, collecting 15 goals and 32 points in 30 games. On February 2, 2017, he returned to the EBEL to continue with HC Bolzano to fulfil his contract obligations. ==Career statistics== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

The condition is \\"usually caused by significantly diminished arterial perfusion of the kidneys due to spasms of the feeding arteries, microvascular injury, or disseminated intravascular coagulation\\" and is the pathological progression of acute tubular necrosis. It is frequently associated with obstetric catastrophes such as abruptio placentae and septic shock, and is three times more common in developing nations versus industrialized nations (2% versus 6% in causes of acute kidney failure). ==Causes== Adults * Pregnancy related (>50% of cases) **Placental abruption **Infected abortion **Prolonged intrauterine fetal death **Severe eclampsia * HIV * Snake bites * Binge drinking * Shock * Trauma * Sickle cell disease * Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) *Sepsis * SLE-associated antiphospholipid syndrome * Vitamin deficiency * Pancreatitis * Malaria * Meningococcemia * Drug-induced toxicity (e.g. NSAIDs, Contrast Media, Quinine, or ATRA) Babies *Congenital heart disease *Fetal-maternal transfusion *Dehydration *Perinatal asphyxia *Anemia *Placental hemorrhage *Severe hemolytic disease *Sepsis ==Pathophysiology== The exact pathologic mechanism for RCN is unclear, however the onset of small vessel pathology is likely an important aspect in the cause of this condition. In general the renal cortex is under greater oxygen tension and more prone to ischemic injury, especially at the level of the proximal collecting tubule, leading to its preferential damage in a sudden drop in perfusion. Rapidly corrected acute renal ischemia leads to acute tubular necrosis, from which complete recovery is possible, while more prolonged ischemia may lead to RCN. Pathologically, the cortex of the kidney is grossly atrophied with relative preservation of the gross structure of the medulla. The damage is usually bilateral owing to its underlying systemic causes, and is most frequently associated with pregnancy (>50% of cases). It accounts for 2% of all cases of acute kidney failure in adults and more than 20% of cases of acute kidney failure during late pregnancy. ==Diagnosis== While the only diagnostic \\"gold standard\\" mechanism of diagnosis en vivo is via kidney biopsy, the clinical conditions and blood clotting disorder often associated with this disease may make it impractical in a clinical setting. Alternatively, it is diagnosed clinically, or at autopsy, with some authors suggesting diagnosis by contrast enhanced CT. ==Treatment== Patients will require dialysis to compensate for the function of their kidneys. ==Prognosis == Cortical necrosis is a severe and life-threatening condition, with mortality rates over 50%. Those mortality rates are even higher in neonates with the condition due to the overall difficult nature of neonatal care and an increased frequency of comorbid conditions. The extent of the necrosis is a major determinant of the prognosis, which in turn is dependent on the duration of ischemia, duration of oliguria, and the severity of the precipitating conditions. Of those that survive the initial event, there are varying degrees of recovery possible, depending on the extent of the damage. ==References External links == Category:Nephrology ","title":"Renal cortical necrosis"},{"id":"35239986","text":"Zygaena marcuna is a species of moth in the Zygaenidae family.

In 1922, new administrative units known as oblasts (Serbo-Croatian: oblasti / –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏) were introduced and the whole country was divided into 33 oblasts.

It is a redundant Anglican parish church, which is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. ==History== The original church was built on the site in 1070, and the recorded list of its rectors goes back to 1230. The present church was built on the same site in 1815. In 1869 Hubert Austin designed new tracery for the east window. It cost ¬£270 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), which also paid for the stained glass that was designed by Henry Holiday, and made by Heaton, Butler and Bayne. In 1904 Austin and Paley carried out work on the church, adding a north aisle, a porch, and buttresses, replacing the floor, removing the plaster ceiling, and providing new seating, a pulpit, and a lectern. This work cost about ¬£900 (equivalent to ¬£). The church was declared redundant on 1 December 2002, due to a decline in the size of the congregation and because of the need for repairs. ==Architecture== St Chad's is constructed in sandstone rubble with a slate roof. It incorporates older fabric dating from about 1300 and from 1602. The plan consists of a nave and chancel in one cell, a north aisle, a north vestry, and a north porch. Along the side of the aisle are three two-light mullioned windows, with a single-light window in the angle with the vestry. On the south wall are three windows containing Perpendicular tracery. Between the nave and the chancel is a buttress. At the west end of the church is a single- light window with a trefoil head in the aisle, a buttress between the aisle and the nave and, in the nave wall, a carved panel containing the name W. Croft and the date 1602. The east window dates probably from about 1300 and has three lights with intersecting tracery and a pointed head. On the west gable is a double bellcote. One bell is said to be inscribed with the date 1296, making it the oldest bell in England. The other bell is dated 1727. Inside the church is a Perpendicular-style arcade dating from 1904, consisting of three semi-circular arches carried on round piers. The baluster font dates from the 18th or early 19th century. ==External features== In the churchyard to the south of the church is a medieval sandstone cross base with an empty socket.

Built and managed by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, it is used for flood control, irrigation, and recreation. Lovewell State Park is located on its north shore. KDOT map of Jewell County ==History== A particularly destructive flood of the Republican River in 1935 drove congressmen and senators from Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska to lobby for the development of a flood control and irrigation project in the river valley. Both the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation produced reports on the viability of the project, ultimately leading to the authorization of the Bostwick Division by the Flood Control Act of 1944 as part of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program. Development of the Division was to include construction of Lovewell Dam and Reservoir, named for early Jewell County, Kansas settler Thomas Lovewell, on White Rock Creek, a tributary of the Republican. Contractors started building the dam January 27, 1955. Construction finished in 1957 with filling of the reservoir beginning October 1. The reservoir became operational October 15, 1957. ==Geography== Lovewell Reservoir is located at (39.8977727, -98.0640461) at an elevation of . It lies in extreme north-central Kansas in the Smoky Hills region of the Great Plains. The entirety of the reservoir lies within Jewell County. The reservoir is impounded at its eastern end by Lovewell Dam. The dam is located at (39.8902899, -98.0267115) at an elevation of . White Rock Creek, a tributary of the Republican River, is both the reservoir's primary inflow from the west and outflow to the east. Smaller tributaries include Montana Creek, which flows south into the reservoir's west end, and Johns Creek, which flows north into the reservoir's west end. Kansas Highway 14 runs north-south immediately west of the reservoir. North Shore Road, a paved county road, runs east-west immediately north of the reservoir. There is one settlement at Lovewell Reservoir: the small community of Webber, Kansas located roughly north of the reservoir's east end. ==Hydrography== The surface area, surface elevation, and water volume of the reservoir fluctuate based on inflow and local climatic conditions. In terms of capacity, the Bureau of Reclamation vertically divides the reservoir into a set of pools based on volume and water level, and it considers the reservoir full when filled to the capacity of its active conservation pool. When full, Lovewell Reservoir has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . When filled to maximum capacity, it has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . The streambed underlying the reservoir has an elevation of . Since the reservoir's initial flooding, sedimentation has gradually accumulated on the reservoir bottom thus raising its elevation. ==Infrastructure== Lovewell Dam is an earth-fill embankment dam with a structural height of and a length of . At its crest, the dam has an elevation of . A concrete spillway controlled by two radial gates is located at the south end of the dam and empties into the creek. Just south of the spillway is a gated wasteway outlet controlled by one radial gate which empties into a short outlet canal and stilling basin. When the reservoir is filled to maximum capacity, the spillway has a discharge capacity of , and the gated wasteway outlet has a capacity of . As part of the Bureau of Reclamation's Bostwick Division, Lovewell Reservoir is connected to a network of canals, reservoirs, and irrigation works that extend across north-central Kansas and south-central Nebraska. A gated outlet from the division's Courtland Canal, located at the north end of Lovewell Dam, provides a second inflow to the reservoir. ==Management== The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation operates and maintains Lovewell Dam and Reservoir. The Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism (KDWP) manages of land around the reservoir as the Lovewell Wildlife Area. ==Parks and recreation== The KDWP operates Lovewell State Park on the north shore of the reservoir's eastern end. The park includes boat ramps, camping facilities, hiking trails, an information center, a marina, sports facilities, and a swimming beach. It also hosts special events, holiday celebrations, and fishing tournaments throughout the year. Lovewell Reservoir is open for sport fishing. Lovewell Wildlife Area is open for hunting although it is restricted in some areas. ==Wildlife== Fish species resident in the reservoir include channel catfish, crappie, walleye, and wiper. Game animals living around the reservoir include deer, pheasants, quail, rabbits, and turkeys. ==See also== * Lovewell State Park * List of Kansas state parks * List of lakes, reservoirs, and dams in Kansas * List of rivers of Kansas ==References * Bostwick Division, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation * Lovewell Dam, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation * Lovewell State Park, Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism * Natural Kansas description of Lovewell Reservoir Category:Reservoirs in Kansas Category:Dams in Kansas Category:United States Bureau of Reclamation dams Category:Dams completed in 1957 Category:Bodies of water of Jewell County, Kansas ","title":"Lovewell Reservoir"},{"id":"35240251","text":"Espa√ßo Agros (in English Agros Space) is an Agros organization business park and headquarters located in a park, located in the Portuguese city of P√≥voa de Varzim, with woods and ancient farming fields. The plan for the park intended to keep the essential rural values of the location, with landscaping and environmental improvements. As such buildings and road construction were conditioned by this plan and quite apart from each other, and the most significant part of the woods were kept, in a clear intention to give the location a natural feeling of a large farm, as the location keeps in most part the picturesque rural landscaping. The park also preserves some of the rural ways that stretch to the woods, now used for walking and relaxation. Beyond Agros Headquarters building, the park also includes an auditorium and a sports and leisure park. Pre-existing ruins were recovered and planned to integrate a museum area, the Agros Museum. A small pre-existing water stream was used to improve landscaping of the park, by enlarging the rivulet banks and a building a small dam, thus creating a new lake that during construction immediately became a natural habitat for several species of migratory birds. ==History== The park is located in the woodlands and old farms known as Anjo, a traditional local Spring picnic area, part of the Anjo festival (Ivy festival) celebrations, at the outskirts of the city of P√≥voa de Varzim. Significant part of the picturesque woods were destroyed when the then IC1 (now A28 motorway/freeway) was constructed in the early 1990s, damaging even Castro culture ruins. Agros was the result of a 1949 joint venture by Vila do Conde and P√≥voa de Varzim farming and milk cooperatives, that later extended to other cooperatives and now groups milk producers from all Northern Portugal. It founded Lactogal with other two cooperatives and produced, in 2011 alone, 525 million liters of milk, 60% of the national production.

It was the group's first studio album in five years, after 2007's Cosmicolor. ==Background== In the time between the release of Cosmicolor and Square One, M-Flo released two greatest hits albums, Award Supernova: Loves Best (2008) and MF10: 10th Anniversary Best (2009) and two outside collaborations compilation albums, M-Flo Inside: Works Best III (2009) and M-Flo Inside: Works Best IV (2010). DJ Taku Takahashi in 2010 launched his second record label, TCY Recording, featuring a collection of unsigned dance musicians. He also produced the soundtrack for the Gainax animated series Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt in 2010, featuring the dance musicians of his newly formed label. The Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt soundtrack was very successful, becoming the third most sold anime soundtrack in 2011 with 30,000 copies sold. Rapper Verbal directed his first music video in 2010, with MINMI's \\"Patto Hana Saku.\\" He launched his solo career in 2010 and 2011, with the album Visionair, featuring collaborations with Namie Amuro, Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj. Takahashi also debuted with a solo project, under the name The Suitboys, releasing a non-stop DJ mix CD After 5 Vol. 1 in March 2012. Taku Takahashi created a dance music web radio station called block.fm, featuring Japanese and overseas DJs as radio hosts, including Verbal. The radio station began airing on November 11, 2011. ==Conception and writing== The album was announced as a third stage in M-Flo's career, featuring Lisa as the group's vocalist between 1998‚Äî2002, and their \\"loves\\" era between 2003‚Äî2008, which featured billed guest vocalists on most of their recordings. For this third stage, M-Flo saw this as a return to their roots, which was the reasoning for the album title, Square One. The album was produced without concerns for what the industry or their management were concerned about, which was similar to how M-Flo had pursued their career when they debuted. Square One took a lot of time to create compared to their previous albums, because Verbal and Taku Takahashi needed to get used to each other's styles and ideas again. Verbal believed that Square One showed off both of the work in their solo careers strongly. The songs were written and produced by M-Flo members Taku Takahashi and Verbal. Eight songs were written in collaboration with fellow Rhythm Zone artist Cream's vocalist, Minami (including the song \\"All I Want Is You\\"), as well as two songs featuring lyrics by Cream's rapper Staxx T. The song \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\" featured lyrics former Hi-Standard vocalist Akihiro Namba, and FLJ music magazine producer Toshiya Ohno. While the songs feature guest vocalists similar to their loves albums, the artists names were not announced. Verbal explained the reasoning behind this was that people attach a certain value and preconception to the name of an artist, and would pay more attention to the music itself if the names were not announced. The song \\"Sure Shot Ricky\\" sampled the viral commercial song , sung by 13-year-old Portuguese boy Miguel Guerreiro. Verbal said the song was chosen as if it were played at a club, it would be a song everyone knows and everyone enjoys. ==Promotion== The song \\"Run\\" was first performed on September 15, 2011 with Mademoiselle Yulia at Reebok's Reethem & Lite launch party, when Verbal was chosen as the Asia creative director for Reebok. M-Flo held a concert and DJ event at AgeHa in Koto, Tokyo on December 22, 2011 called B≈çnenkai (End-of- Year Party). The event featured a set with M-Flo's new material, as well as DJs Yasutaka Nakata (Capsule), Fantastic Plastic Machine, and a set with Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt collaborators TeddyLoid, Hoshina Anniversary and Booty Bronx. The concert featured material from Square One, an excerpt of which was featured on the DVD of the album. \\"She's So (Outta Control)\\" was released as the leading track from the album, two weeks before the album's release on February 29, 2012. It is a collaboration with South Korean pop/R&B; group 2NE1 on vocals. The song reached number 43 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart. Three music videos were produced for songs on the album: \\"She's So (Outta Control),\\" as well as the tracks \\"All I Want Is You\\" and \\"Alive.\\" Due to digital downloads, the song \\"Alive\\" debuted at number 81 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100. 12 of the 19 album tracks were released for download on cellphone download provider Recochoku on February 29, 2012. A special edition of the album was released at Tsutaya, featuring a bonus CD with \\"Let Go (VIP Mix),\\" a remix by Taku Takahashi of their 2006 hit song. Verbal held a special event at Shinjuku's Tsutaya store on March 18, 2012 where he acted as the store manager, and will hold another on April 14 at Okayama's Tsushima Mall Tsutaya store. Two of the songs featured commercial tie-ups. \\"She's So (Outta Control)\\" was used as the March 2012 opening theme song for the TV Asahi show Musicru TV, and was chosen as MTV Japan's March 2012 buzz clip. \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\" will be used as the opening theme song for the drama Toshidensetsu no Onna, starring Masami Nagasawa. The drama began airing on April 13, 2012. \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\" was released as a tour exclusive single at their M-Flo Tour 2012 'Square One'. On May 6, 2012, \\"Alive\\" was performed live by Verbal and Exile's Atsushi on Exile's weekly television show Exile Tamashii. == Tours == M-Flo held a four-date tour Japan, M-Flo Tour 2012 'Square One' in May and June 2012, in the cities Chiba, Fukuoka, Osaka and Nagoya. M-Flo organised the first event at Avex festival A-Nation for 2012, Oto Matsuri held on August 3, 2012. They also held their second annual Bonenkai end-of-year club party, on December 21, 2012, at the club Ageha. ==Track listingChart rankings== {  !Charts (2012) !Peak position - Oricon daily singles align=\\"center\\"4 - Oricon weekly albums align=\\"center\\"10 - Oricon monthly albums align=\\"center\\"31 } Reported sales {  !Chart !Amount - Oricon physical sales (subscription only) align=\\"center\\"26,000 } ==Personnel== Credits for Square One adapted from the liner booklet. * Masaji Asakawa ‚Äì executive production for Artimage * Junji Chiba ‚Äì keyboards (track 6) * Ryuhei Chiba ‚Äì executive supervision * Kurt \\"KC\\" Common ‚Äì narrator (track 1) * El Poco Maro ‚Äì programming (track 16) * Taiki Fudanotsuji ‚Äì assistant recording engineer (track 4, 7, 15, 18‚Äì19) * Yosuke Fukui ‚Äì lyrics (track 13), music composition (track 13) * Chisa Fukuyama ‚Äì narrator (track 4, 7) * Stewart Hawkes ‚Äì mastering (track 1‚Äì6, 8‚Äì11, 13‚Äì14, 16‚Äì19) * Shinji Hayashi ‚Äì executive supervision * Mitsunori Ikeda ‚Äì guitars (track 9), mixing (track 2‚Äì3, 5‚Äì6, 8‚Äì11, 13‚Äì14, 16‚Äì18), programming (track 1‚Äì3, 5‚Äì11, 13‚Äì14, 17‚Äì19), recording engineer (track 2‚Äì3, 5‚Äì6, 8‚Äì11, 13‚Äì14, 16‚Äì18) * Osamu \\"Shu\\" Imamoto ‚Äì recording engineer (track 2‚Äì3, 5, 8‚Äì9, 11, 14 17) * Hiroshi Inagaki ‚Äì general producer * Koji Kage ‚Äì lyrics (track 13) * Naoki Kakuta ‚Äì recording engineer (track 3) * Keigo ‚Äì guitars (track 8) * Lee Kyungjoon ‚Äì recording engineer (track 17) * Yasuji Maeda ‚Äì mastering (track 7, 12, 15) * Masato \\"Max\\" Matsuura ‚Äì executive production for Avex Group * Minami (Cream)‚Äì lyrics (track 2‚Äì3, 5, 9, 11, 14, 17‚Äì18), music composition (track 2‚Äì3, 5, 9, 11, 14, 17‚Äì18) * Akihiro Namba ‚Äì bass (track 8), lyrics (track 8), music composition (track 8) * Ryosuke Nakanishi ‚Äì soundtrack, programming (track 4, 7, 19) * Maki Nishijima ‚Äì lyrics (track 13) * Toshiya Ohno ‚Äì vocal direction (track 8), lyrics (track 8), music composition (track 8) * Rim Juhee ‚Äì narrator (track 1) * Morley Robertson ‚Äì serge synthesizer (track 15) * Jun Sasaki ‚Äì keyboards (track 18) * Dai Sat≈ç ‚Äì Square One interlude co-author * Yoshihiro Seki ‚Äì general producer for Avex Entertainment, inc. * Seiji Sekine ‚Äì mixing (track 1, 4, 7, 12, 15, 19), recording engineer (track 4, 7, 15, 18‚Äì19) * Staxx T (Cream) ‚Äì lyrics (track 9), music composition (track 9), vocal direction (track 9) * Taku Takahashi ‚Äì lyrics (track 2‚Äì3, 5‚Äì6, 8, 9‚Äì11, 13‚Äì14, 16‚Äì18), music composition (track 1‚Äì19), production, programming (track 1‚Äì3, 5‚Äì11, 13‚Äì14, 16‚Äì19), recording engineer (track 6) * Muga Takeda ‚Äì Square One interlude co-author * Yoshinori Takeshita ‚Äì narrator (track 1) * Shigeru Takeuchi ‚Äì executive supervision * Teddy ‚Äì vocal direction (track 17) * TeddyLoid ‚Äì programming (track 16) * Taiichi Uesawa ‚Äì recording engineer (track 1‚Äì2, 4, 7, 15, 19) * Lucas Valentine ‚Äì recording engineer (track 5, 10‚Äì11, 18) * Verbal ‚Äì executive planning, direction, lyrics (track 2‚Äì3, 5‚Äì6, 8, 9‚Äì11, 13‚Äì14, 16‚Äì18), music composition (track 1‚Äì19), production * Yu Li Xin ‚Äì narrator (track 1) * Yutaro Wada ‚Äì assistant recording engineer (track 3) * Yoon ‚Äì Art direction, design, styling ==Release history== { !

However, there might be problems for the committee to reach an agreement on which book should be include/exclude for their libraries due to the following two reasons: Firstly, the committee members might be different in terms of education background and personal interests, therefore, they might come up with ‚Äúdifferent theories of what the library shall be‚Äù. Secondly, even without the disagreement of theories, it is impossible for committee members to have an adequate knowledge of ‚Äúbooks, editions, and prices, outside of their own line of reading.‚Äù Thus they need the assistance from experts to revise and complete their booklist for libraries.William F.

He suggested a co-operative way for creating the collection guide among library committee, field specialist, as well as authors, for the reason that ‚Äúno one person living unites in himself the wisdom necessary to make the best notes on all the books of the library‚Äù, and ‚Äúnot one but many minds must contribute to the work [of book selection].‚Äù Dewey also suggested American Library Association (A.L.A) appoints a committee to take ‚Äúentire charge‚Äù of the ‚Äúcoming catalogue‚Äù. The primary usage of such catalogue would be ‚Äúas a guide in the purchase of books for either private or public collection; as the main catalog of many of these libraries.‚ÄùMelvil Dewey, ‚ÄúThe Coming Catalogue,‚Äù Library Journal 1 (August, 1877): 423-427. Based on Dewey‚Äôs article, A.L.A. began to take steps of creating such catalog. In November 1878, A.L.A. appointed five people as the committee in charge of the catalog. They decided to adopt a classified arrangement of the catalog. The catalog was planned to be about 250 pages with a fixed price of $2.50.Library Journal 3 (November, 1878): 331. After years‚Äô cession of catalog development, Dewey attempted to restart his plan for A.L.A. catalog when he worked at Columbia College as the ‚ÄúLibrarian in Chief‚Äù in 1883. He tried to obtain suggestion from Columbia faculty members through their lectures on ‚Äúbibliography and literature in their areas of expertise‚Äù when the School of Library Economy was established in 1887, and later Dewey moved to University of the State of New York in 1888, where he continued his work on catalog by asking his library employees and students in Albany to compile the catalog through scholarly journals. The Catalog was finally published and promoted in the A.L.A. annual conference in 1893 at the Chicago World‚Äôs Fair. The 1893 Catalog of A.L.A. library provides a list of 5000 ‚Äúbest reading selections‚Äù that were ‚Äúapproved by distinguished specialists in various lines and organized by librarians into two separate classification schemes‚Äù.Wayne A. Wiegand:245-249 ==Early Adoption in Libraries== After the Catalog had been developed, more and more libraries began to adopt it as the guide for book selection. For instance, Mrs. Horace M. Towner, one of the trustee members of Iowa Library Commission in Corning, published a short paper ‚ÄúTrustees‚Äô Problems‚Äù in Iowa Library Quarterly in 1908 discussing the budget problem related to book purchasing. Towner states that the general rules for books purchasing is depending on the specific situation within each library. In other words, there is no fixed rule for book purchasing. However, Towner discussed a lot about the ‚Äúright‚Äù evaluation of fiction. In order to avoid unsuitable and vicious fiction in a library, trustees should rely on ‚Äúbest‚Äù book reviews, in addition to ‚ÄúBooklist‚Äù from ALA. In the end of the article, Towner pointed out trustee members should read report from professional journals, like Library Journal and Public Libraries, to obtain knowledge from other library about the budget issue.Horace. M. Towner. ‚ÄúTrustees‚Äô Problems,‚Äù Iowa Library Quarterly 5, no.13 (1908): 189-190. == References == Category:Library cataloging and classification ","title":"A.L.A. catalog"},{"id":"35240551","text":"Radomir Raduloviƒá (; born August 14, 1960) is a retired Serbian footballer. ==References Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:People from Seƒçanj Category:Yugoslav footballers Category:Serbian footballers Category:FK Partizan players Category:FC Istres players Category:Yugoslav First League players Category:Ligue 2 players Category:Serbian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in France Category:Association football midfielders ","title":"Radomir Raduloviƒá"},{"id":"35240598","text":"Teglv√¶rksbroen is a bascule bridge which connects Sluseholmen to Teglholmen in the South Harbour of Copenhagen, Denmark.

The movement began with a weekly occupation of the checkpoint, which is located in the buffer zone that divides the island's territory and capital into the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus since the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. On November 19 of 2011 the occupation of the buffer zone became permanent. Influenced by the global Occupy Movement, Occupy Buffer Zone aimed to protest and publicise the problems of the global economic and political system, as well as to raise awareness of how \\"the Cyprus Problem is but one of the many symptoms of an unhealthy global system\\". The movement emphasised the connection between the development of the Cyprus problem and the economic and political interests associated with the international economic and political status quo. ==Occupy Buffer Zone's general statement== The following text is the movement's general statement that was distributed to passers by in the buffer zone. \\"This is an inclusive movement functioning within some principal umbrella concepts for which we initially united, these are: -The reunification of Cyprus. -To raise awareness of how the Cyprus Problem is but one of the many symptoms of an unhealthy global system. It is important to elaborate on the intended inclusiveness of the last point. We have occupied the space of the buffer zone to express with our presence our mutual desire for reunification and to stand in solidarity with the wave of unrest which has come as a response to the failings of the global systemic paradigm. We want to promote understanding of the local problem within this global context and in this way show how the Cyprus Problem is but one of the many symptoms of an unhealthy system. In this way, we have reclaimed the space of the buffer zone to create events (screenings, talks etc.) and media of these events, which relate to the system as a whole and its numerous and diverse consequences. Opinions expressed in this manner are not necessarily of the entire group, only the umbrella points of reunification and solidarity with the global movement can be assumed to be.\\" ==Development== The movement began on 15 October 2011 with a weekly occupation of the buffer zone in Ledra/Lokmacƒ± street in Nicosia. Greek and Turkish Cypriot activists had gathered in Eleftheria Square in Nicosia as a response to the global call for a protest on the 15th of October. Through discussion they decided to move the occupation from the Eleftheria Square to the buffer zone located in the Ledra/Lokmacƒ± street. The buffer zone was occupied subsequently on the 22nd and the 29th of October and the 5th of November. On the 19th of November activists set up tents and made camp in the buffer zone for the night. The decision was then taken that the occupation would become permanent. On 1 January 2012 the activists further occupied the abandoned buildings that were located in the buffer zone. The buildings have been used by the movement for its cultural and political activities, such as hosting and developing various workshops and the movement's General Assemblies. The United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) asked the activists to leave the buffer zone on 14 January 2012 claiming that the occupation did not meet United Nations' regulation for activities in the buffer zone, but it did not employ any forceful methods for the evacuation of the area. After the Police raid on 6 April 2012, the movement's activities and organisation began to fade. By June 2012, the occupation of the buffer zone was essentially over. ==Police raid== On 6 April 2012, a strong police force from the Republic of Cyprus gathered in the area occupied by the activists and raided the occupied buildings at around 10:15pm. The operation included the anti-terrorist department and the anti-drug department of the police force. Policemen, equipped with guns, helmets and batons smashed the door and entered the building. A sequence of screaming and sounds of smashing and breaking followed. The police reported that it made 28 arrests, including 11 minors and that it had confiscated 1 gram of cannabis. The police was reported to have used excessive and unjustified violence in the operation. Eyewitnesses reported that the police repeatedly hit a 24-year-old woman, \\"causing a massive bump to her forehead, as well as multiple cuts and bruises\\". Reports were also made of sexual assault on a 19-year-old woman, the beating of two activists that were arrested in the building, and for unjustified violence on the crowd of activists and passers by that had gathered outside the building. A demonstration against police brutality and the police raid was organised on 12 April by political student magazine Skapoula, whose members had been participating in the movement and were arrested by the police on 6 April. ==Images== File:Obz 15oct eleftheria.jpg First meeting of the Occupy Buffer Zone movement in Eleftheria Square, 15 of October, 2011.

He grew up in El Biar and discovered tennis which would become his passion. He attended secondary school at Algiers and at Lyc√©e Janson de Sailly in Paris. Abdesselam followed courses at Sciences Po and obtained a law degree at the Law Faculty of Paris. He continued along with tennis and became one of the best French players. He was junior champion of France twice in 1937 and 1938, then world champion University in 1939. During the Second World War, when he reached his best, he joined Algiers in 1942 after the Allied landings in North Africa. He participated as a liaison officer in the Italian campaign in the French Expeditionary Corps under the command of Marshal Alphonse Juin. He was recommended several times and obtained the Cross of War 1939‚Äì1945 and the U.S. Bronze Star Medal. When the war ended, his international career as a tennis player resumed. For a number of years he was the second best French player and was selected fourteen times in Davis Cup from 1947 to 1953 and compiled a record of 11 match wins and 10 losses. He reached the fourth round of the French Championships in 1938 and 1947 and the quarterfinals in 1949.

He was elected MNA in Algiers in 1958 for the Unit√© de la R√©publique. Abdesselam argued for the maintenance of French Algeria, which cuts of Gaullism, and integration, which cuts the Organisation arm√©e secr√®te (OAS). Considered by Algerian independence fighters as a traitor, he was riddled with bullets in Paris by an activist of the Front de Lib√©ration Nationale (FLN) on 4 May 1960. On 8 November 1961, Robert Abdesselam was one of 80 parliamentarians who voted for the \\"amendment Salan.\\" He was an opponent of the √âvian Accords and in March 1962 called them \\"inhumane, disgraceful and unworthy of our country.\\" The same year he was called as a witness at trial of Edmond Jouhaud and Raoul Salan. After the independence of Algeria in 1962, Abdesselam abandoned politics to devote himself to his profession of international lawyer. He took part in the development of the Lacoste company abroad.

Despite some variation in its definition and application, the hypothesis is generally defined by two postulates. The first states that those personality characteristics that are important to a group of people will eventually become a part of that group's language. The second follows from the first, stating that more important personality characteristics are more likely to be encoded into language as a single word. With origins in the late 19th century, use of the lexical hypothesis began to flourish in English and German psychology in the early 20th century. The lexical hypothesis is a major foundation of the Big Five personality traits, the HEXACO model of personality structure and the 16PF Questionnaire and has been used to study the structure of personality traits in a number of cultural and linguistic settings. ==History== Early estimates Sir Francis Galton Sir Francis Galton was one of the first scientists to apply the lexical hypothesis to the study of personality, stating: Despite Galton's early ventures into the lexical study of personality, over two decades passed before English-language scholars continued his work. A 1910 study by G. E. Partridge listed approximately 750 English adjectives used to describe mental states, while a 1926 study of Webster's New International Dictionary by M. L. Perkins provided an estimate of 3,000 such terms. These early explorations and estimates were not limited to the English-speaking world, with philosopher and psychologist Ludwig Klages stating in 1929 that the German language contains approximately 4,000 words to describe inner states. Psycholexical studies Allport & Odbert Gordon Allport Nearly half a century after Galton first investigated the lexical hypothesis, Franziska Baumgarten published the first psycholexical classification of personality-descriptive terms. Using dictionaries and characterology publications, Baumgarten identified 1,093 separate terms in the German language used in the description of personality and mental states. Although this figure is similar in size to the German and English estimates offered by earlier researchers, Gordon Allport and Henry S. Odbert revealed this to be a severe underestimate in a 1936 study. Similar to the earlier work of M. L. Perkins, they used Webster's New International Dictionary as their source. From this list of approximately 400,000 words, Allport and Odbert identified 17,953 unique terms used to describe personality or behavior. This is one of the most influential psycholexical studies in the history of trait psychology. Not only was it the longest, most exhaustive list of personality-descriptive words at the time, it was also one of the earliest attempts at classifying English-language terms with the use of psychological principles. Using their list of nearly 18,000 terms, Allport and Odbert separated these into four categories or \\"columns\\": :Column I: This group contains 4,504 terms that describe or are related to personality traits. Being the most important of the four columns to Allport and Odbert and future psychologists, its terms most closely relate to those used by modern personality psychologists (e.g., aggressive, introverted, sociable). Allport and Odbert suggested that this column represented a minimum rather than final list of trait terms. Because of this, they recommended that other researchers consult the remaining three columns in their studies. :Column II: In contrast with the more stable dispositions described by terms in Column I, this group includes terms describing present states, attitudes, emotions, and moods (e.g., rejoicing, frantic). Reflecting this focus on temporary states, present participles represent the majority of the 4,541 terms in Column II. :Column III: The largest of the four groups, Column III contains 5,226 words related to social evaluations of an individual's character (e.g., worthy, insignificant). Unlike the previous two columns, this group does not refer to internal psychological attributes of a person. As such, Allport and Odbert acknowledged that Column III did not meet their definition of trait-related terms. Predating the person-situation debate by over 30 years, Allport and Odbert included this group to appease researchers in social psychology, sociology, and ethics. :Column IV: The last of Allport and Odbert's four columns contained 3,682 words. Called the \\"miscellaneous column\\" by the authors, Column IV contains important personality-descriptive terms that did not fit into the other three columns. Allport and Odbert offered potential subgroups for terms describing behaviors (e.g., pampered, crazed), physical qualities associated with psychological traits (e.g., lean, roly-poly), and talents or abilities (e.g., gifted, prolific). However, they noted that these subdivisions were not necessarily accurate, as: (i) innumerable subgroups were possible, (ii) these subgroups would not incorporate all of the miscellaneous terms, and (iii) further editing might reveal that these terms do fit into the other three columns. Allport and Odbert did not present these four columns as representing orthogonal concepts. Many of their nearly 18,000 terms could have been differently classified or placed into multiple categories, particularly those in Columns I and II. Although the authors attempted to remedy this with the aid of three outside editors, the average level of agreement between these independent reviewers was approximately 47%. Noting that each outside judge seemed to have a preferred column, the authors decided to present the classifications performed by Odbert. Rather than try to rationalize this decision, Allport and Odbert presented the results of their study as somewhat arbitrary and unfinished. Warren Norman Throughout the 1940s, researchers such as Raymond Cattell and Donald Fiske used factor analysis to explore the overarching structure of the trait terms in Allport and Odbert's Column I. Rather than rely on the factors obtained by these researchers, Warren Norman conducted an independent analysis of Allport and Odbert's terms in 1963. Despite finding a five-factor structure similar to Fiske's, Norman decided to return to Allport and Odbert's original list to create a more precise and better-structured taxonomy of terms. Using the 1961 edition of Webster's International Dictionary, Norman added relevant terms and removed those from Allport and Odbert's list that were no longer in use. This resulted in a source list of approximately 40,000 potential trait-descriptive terms. Using this list, Norman then removed terms that were deemed archaic or obsolete, solely evaluative, overly obscure, dialect-specific, loosely related to personality, and purely physical. By doing so, Norman reduced his original list to 2,797 unique trait-descriptive terms. Norman's work would eventually serve as the basis for Dean Peabody and Lewis Goldberg's explorations of the Big Five personality traits. Juri Apresjan and the Moscow Semantic School In the 1970s, Juri Apresjan, a thought leader of the Moscow Semantic School, developed the systemic, or systematic, approach to lexicography which utilizes the concept of the language picture of the world. This concept is also called the naive picture of the world in order to stress the non-scientific view of the world which is imprinted in natural language. In his book \\"Systematic Lexicography\\", which was published in English in 2000, J.D.Apresjan puts forward the idea of building dictionaries on the basis of \\"reconstructing the so-called naive picture of the world, or the \\"world-view\\", underlying the partly universal and partly language specific pattern of conceptualizations inherent in any natural language\\". In his opinion, the general world-view can be fragmented into different more local pictures of reality, such as naive geometry, naive physics, naive psychology, and so forth. In particular, one chapter of the book Apresjan allots to the description of lexicographic reconstruction of the language picture of the human being in the Russian language. Later on, Apresjan's work laid basis for Sergey Golubkov's further attempts to build \\"the language personality theory\\" which would be different from other lexically-based personality theories (e.g. by Allport, Cattell, Eysenck, etc.) due to its meronomic (partonomic) nature versus the taxonomic nature of the previously mentioned personality theories. Psycholexical studies of values In addition to research on personality, the psycholexical approach has also been applied to the study of values in multiple languages, providing a contrast with theory-driven approaches such as Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values. ==Similar concepts== Philosophy Concepts similar to the lexical hypothesis are at the root of ordinary language philosophy. Similar to the use of the lexical hypothesis to understand personality, ordinary language philosophers propose that philosophical problems can be solved or better understood through an exploration of everyday language. In his essay \\"A Plea for Excuses,\\" J. L. Austin cited three main justifications for this approach: words are tools, words are not only facts or things, and commonly used words \\"embod[y] all the distinctions men have found worth drawing...we are using a sharpened awareness of words to sharpen our perception of, though not as the final arbiter of, the phenomena.\\" ==Criticism== Despite its widespread use in the study of personality, the lexical hypothesis has been challenged for a number of reasons. The following list describes some of the major critiques levelled against the lexical hypothesis and personality models founded on psycholexical studies. * That the lexical hypothesis uses verbal descriptors in investigation of behavioural individual differences is viewed as a methodological flaw in this method when applied to personality theory. First, there is a natural pro-social bias of language in people's verbal evaluations. Language is an invention of group dynamics that was developed to facilitate socialization, the exchange of information and the synchronization of group activity. This social function of language therefore creates a sociability bias in verbal descriptors of human behaviour: there are more words related to social than physical or even mental aspects of behavior. The sheer number of such descriptors will cause them to group into a largest factor in any language, and such grouping has nothing to do with the way that core systems of individual differences are set up. Second, there is also a negativity bias in emotionality (i.e., most emotions have negative affectivity), and there are more words in language to describe negative rather than positive emotions. Such asymmetry in emotional valence creates another bias in language. Experiments using the lexical hypothesis approach indeed demonstrated that the use of lexical material skews the resulting dimensionality according to a sociability bias of language and a negativity bias of emotionality, grouping all evaluations around these two dimensions. This means that the two largest dimensions in the Big Five model of personality (i.e., Extraversion and Neuroticism) might be just an artifact of the lexical approach that this model employed. * Many traits of psychological importance are too complex to be encoded into single terms or used in everyday language. In fact, an entire text may be the only way to accurately capture and reflect some important personality characteristics. * Laypeople use personality-descriptive terms in an ambiguous manner. Similarly, many of the terms used in psycholexical studies are too ambiguous to be useful in a psychological context. * The lexical hypothesis relies on terms that were not developed by experts. As such, any models developed with the lexical hypothesis reflect lay perceptions rather than expert psychological knowledge. * Language accounts for a minority of communication and is inadequate to describe much of human experience. * The mechanisms that led to the development of personality lexicons are poorly understood. * Personality-descriptive terms change over time and differ in meaning across dialects, languages, and cultures. * The methods used to test the lexical hypothesis are unscientific. * Personality-descriptive language is too broad to be captured with a single word class, yet psycholexical studies of personality largely rely on adjectives. ==See also== * 16 Personality Factors ==References * Language Personality Theory Category:Personality theories Category:Linguistic theories and hypotheses Category:Philosophical theories Category:Philosophical terminology Category:Philosophy of language ","title":"Lexical hypothesis"},{"id":"35240764","text":"Odeon, Boston, 19th century Detail of 1838 map of Boston, showing Odeon on Federal St. The Odeon (1835-c. 1846) of Boston, Massachusetts, was a lecture and concert hall on Federal Street in the building also known as the Boston Theatre.Boston Almanac. 1841 The 1,300-seat auditorium measured \\"50 feet square\\" with \\"red moreen\\"-upholstered \\"seats arranged in a circular order, and above them ... spacious galleries.\\" The Boston Academy of Music occupied the Odeon in the 1830s and 1840sBoston Academy of Music.

The boat is then blocked at the equator for weeks, and a mutiny ensues. The vessel eventually lapses into a storm, leaving the protagonist and his friend Toine alone and adrift on the sea.

It is a countrywide organization that the King and Queen of Thailand have sponsored since 1972 in order to promote national unity. It was first founded by the Thai Border Patrol Police (BPP) under the aegis of the Ministry of Interior. ==20th century Village Scouts== The Village Scouts were mustered from 1971 on to fight the communist insurgency and the pro-democracy movement in Thailand as well as the progressive Farmers' Federation of Thailand. They were modeled on the \\"grass roots\\" defense organizations in South Vietnam. At their core were rich and independent farmers. The Village Scouts were organized in small cells, usually commanded by an urban right-wing politician. They were taught to oppose \\"radical elements\\", and to defend Thailand's symbolic trinity of nation-religion-monarchy. Directly controlled by the Ministry of Interior and sponsored by rich royalists in the cities, the Village Scouts' supreme patron was King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The king and the royal family visited Village Scout units to bless their scarves and flags. The Village Scouts would act as \\"ears and eyes\\" of the government and report strangers entering their villages to local officials. A short time after the establishment of the Village Scouts, over five million Thais, or 10 percent of the population, had completed the organization's five-day training course. From 1971 to 1985, more than ten million adult Thais had gone through Village Scout training. The Village Scouts were deployed to counter the protests of the pro-democracy and students movement. They were called via radio to occupy strategic points in all major towns during the protests against US bases in the country and against the return of ousted military dictators Thanom Kittikachorn and Praphas Charusathien. The probably best-known, and most impactful, mission of the Village Scouts was during the anti-leftist rally that led to the Thammasat University massacre on 6 October 1976, in which at least 46 people were killed and led to the subsequent coup d'√©tat and return to military rule. By appealing more and more to urban, right-wing conservatives, the organization gradually moved away from its poor, rural base. The movement fizzled out during the 1980s. ==21st century Village Scouts== The Village Scouts re-emerged as an ultranationalist mass organization after the turn of the millennium against the backdrop of the Muslim separatist conflict in the three southernmost provinces. ==See also== * Cyber Scouts (Thailand) * Red Gaurs * Nawaphon * Rubbish Collection Organization * Thai Rangers ==References== Category:Anti-communism in Thailand Category:Vigilantes Category:Nationalist movements in Asia Category:Paramilitary organizations based in Thailand Category:Military units and formations established in 1971 ","title":"Village Scouts"},{"id":"35240870","text":"Baqerabad (, also Romanized as BƒÅqerƒÅbƒÅd, Bakirabad, and BƒÅqirƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Zeynabad Rural District, Shal District, Buin Zahra County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

The company manufactures and provides equipment, systems, software and services to the poultry, meat and fish processing industries. Marel is a large manufacturer of food processing equipment for primary, secondary, and tertiary processing. The company employs approximately 6,000 people in offices and subsidiaries in over 30 countries, across six continents. The company is headquartered in Gar√∞ab√¶r, Iceland. ==History== Marel was founded in 1983 when some young engineers at the University of Iceland began to experiment with electronics and early computers. R√∂gnvaldur √ìlafsson, J√≥n √û√≥r √ìlafsson, P√©tur J√≥nsson, and T√≥mas R√≠kar√∞sson identified the needs of many fish processors in Iceland to quickly and accurately weigh fish as they were being processed to minimize the giveaway of product, and withstand the harsh and wet conditions of fish processing plants. The Marel engineers focused on implementing early computer technology into food processing equipment, an area where it had not been used extensively. The design plan was to have an array of interconnected systems to increase automation in food processing. ==Products== Marel develops, manufactures, sells, and distributes equipment, further processing equipment, software and services for the poultry, fish and meat industries. Marel's poultry processing sector offers integrated systems for processing broilers, turkeys, and ducks. The Marel Fish Processing segment provides equipment and systems for farmed and wild salmon and whitefish processing. Marel's Meat Processing division offers systems and equipment for the processes of slaughtering, deboning and trimming, case-ready food services, and bacon processing. Marel also offers wastewater treatment equipment designed specifically for the food industry, and packing and logistics products. ==Corporation== The Marel brand was established in 1983 and went public on the Icelandic Stock Exchange in 1992. The listing in 1992 marked Marel's progress from a startup that exclusively focused on the fishing industry, to a global company with operations in diverse industries. In 2007, Marel changed its corporate identity to Marel Food Systems after acquiring four new brands in 2006: AEW Delford, Carnitech, Marel and Scanvaegt. The acquisition of these companies significantly increased the size of Marel's operations around the world. On January 1, 2010, Marel Food Systems hf. changed their name back to Marel hf. after their integration with Stork Food Systems of the Netherlands was completed. This was part of Marel's strategy to integrate all of the companies they acquired throughout the years under a common identity and company name. Marel bought MPS meat processing systems in 2015 for EUR 382 million (US$458 million) to increase their product offerings in the meat segment (pig, cattle, and sheep) to balance their knowhow in the fish and poultry industries. In conjunction with the sale, Marel also acquired MPS's intra-logistics systems for food industries and industrial wastewater treatment systems. MPS has headquarters in the Netherlands, with production sites in the Netherlands and China. In July 2017, Marel acquired Sulmaq in Brazil to expand its operations in South and Central America. Brazil is the second-largest producer of beef and the third-largest producer of poultry products in the world. Sulmaq is based in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil and employs approximately 400 people. Sulmaq's processing operations include hog slaughtering, cattle slaughtering, cutting and deboning, viscera processing and logistics. On August 14, 2018, Marel finalized the acquisition of German-based manufacturer of processing equipment MAJA. Under the MAJA acquisition, Marel has acquired a more diverse product line-up and a more extensive global distribution network. In October 2019 Marel acquired Cedar Creek Company, an Brisbane, Australian provider of specialized software and hardware equipment for meat, seafood and poultry processors. In November 2019 Marel finalized a 40% share in Curio ehf, an Icelandic-based manufacturer of advanced equipment for whitefish processing. Marel will acquire an additional 10% of the company on 1 January 2021 with the option to acquire the remaining 50% of shares in four years. Both companies have a long history of collaboration and Curio will now be part of Marel's sales and service network to extend their global reach. On June 7, 2019, Marel had its initial public offering on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange (ticker symbol: MAREL). Amsterdam was a logical choice for the second listing of Marel shares as the company already has a strong presence in the Netherlands where 1/3 of its employees are based. √Årni Oddur √û√≥r√∞arson has been the Chief Executive Officer of Marel hf since 2013. Prior to becoming CEO, √Årni was the Chairman of Marel's Board of Directors from 2005 to October 31, 2013. ==Key acquisitions dates== * 1997 ‚Äì Marel acquires Carnitech in Denmark * 2002 ‚Äì Marel acquires CP Food Machinery * 2004 ‚Äì Marel acquires Pols in Iceland * 2006 ‚Äì Marel acquires AEW Delford in the UK * 2006 ‚Äì Marel acquires Scanvaegt in Denmark * 2008 ‚Äì Marel acquires Stork Food Systems in the Netherlands together with Townsend, owned by Stork * 2016 ‚Äì Marel acquires MPS in the Netherlands * 2017 ‚Äì Marel acquires Sulmaq in Brazil * 2018 Marel acquires MAJA in Germany * 2019 Marel acquires Cedar Creek of Brisbane, Australia and Curio ehf, Hafnarfj√∂r√∞ur, Iceland ==Recognitions== In 2012 Marel was awarded the EuroTier Gold Award for their contribution in environmental conservation and product safety for poultry processing. The American Meat Institute named Marel their supplier of the year in 2013. In 2014, Marel Stork Poultry Processing won an award in the category of Processing with their \\"New reference in whole product distribution\\". Marel also received the most public votes at the event, making them the overall winner of the VIV Europe 2014 innovation award. In Georgia, USA, Marel Stork Poultry Processing was recognized in 2014 by Gainesville-Hall County in their Industry of the Year Awards.

The system was intended as a transitional system between the Russian Imperial division of governorates and the modern equivalent of oblasts. As a literal translation, the word \\"okruha\\" means vicinity or neighborhood (sharing a root with the words \\"circle\\" and \\"around\\", a close equivalent is the German term bezirk). This level of subdivision is roughly equivalent to that of a county, parish, or borough. Okruhas were first established in 1918 when the Polissya Okruha and Taurida Okruha were created as temporary territories of the Ukrainian State of 1918. ==History== Formation First okruhas, created just before 1918, were Polissya Okruha centered in Mozyr and Taurida Okruha centered in Berdyansk.

It split the water concession into an east and a west concession with Manila Water being awarded one contract and Maynilad Water Services being awarded the other. ==History== The first water system in the Philippines was initiated by the Spanish Philanthropist, Francisco Carriedo y Peredo (November 7, 1690 - September 1743). Carriedo donated funds to be used in Manila; however, it was never realized until a century later, when the Spanish Franciscan friar Felix Huerta, tracked down the funds donated by Carriedo, and instigated the development of the Carriedo Water System. The construction of the water system delivered 16 million liters of water per day to 300,000 people. By 1909, the capacity of the system was increased to 92 million liters per day by the addition of pumping facilities and the construction of Wawa Dam. With its expansion of responsibilities, the institution changed its name several times from the Carriedo Water System, to the Manila Water Supply System in 1908, to the Metropolitan Water District in 1919, to the National Waterworks and Sewerage System Authority (Pangasiwaan ng Pambansang Tubig at Alkantarilya), and finally, to the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) in 1971.

It is an agent and contractor of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS). Maynilad is one of two private water providers in Metro Manila, the other being Manila Water. Incorporated in 1997, Maynilad currently serves over 9 million people in the cities of Caloocan, Las Pi√±as, Malabon, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Para√±aque, Pasay, and Valenzuela; along with most of the City of Manila and portions of Quezon City and Makati west of the Metro Manila Skyway. Outside of Metro Manila, in Cavite Province it serves the cities of Cavite, Bacoor and Imus and the municipalities of Kawit, Noveleta and Rosario. MWS, Estero de Binondo floodgate and pumping station ==History== As part of the water privatization in Metro Manila, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System awarded contracts to two companies splitting Metro Manila into a west and east zones. Maynilad Water Services Inc. was formed in 1997 as a partnership of the Benpres Holdings Corporation (now the Lopez Group of Companies) and Ondeo Water Services Inc. after it won the bidding to run the water and wastewater services in the West Zone. Benpres eventually left the partnership in 2006 to settle a US$240 million debt. Then January 24, 2007, a consortium led by Metro Pacific Investments Corporation and the DMCI Holdings, Inc. took over the company and able to pay the debt by January 2008. ==Water Source== Angat Dam is the main source of water for Metro Manila. It supplies about 90 percent of raw water requirements for Metro Manila through the facilities of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System. Maynilad is sourcing its more than 90 percent raw water supply requirement from Angat Dam. Laguna de Bay is another source of water for Maynilad, mainly serving Muntinlupa and Cavite. ==Service area== West Zone (Metro Manila) Zones of Metro Manila allocated to Maynilad Water (red) and Manila Water (blue) * Manila (excluding the districts of Santa Ana, Manila and San Andres, Manila) * Caloocan * Las Pi√±as * Malabon * Muntinlupa * Navotas * Pasay * Para√±aque * Valenzuela * Northern and western parts of Quezon City * Wester parts of Makati (West of South Superhighway) Cavite *Bacoor *Cavite City *Imus *Kawit *Noveleta *Rosario == Impact ==  Access to Water  By the end of 2018, Maynilad posted a total of 1,407,503 accounts or about 9.5 million people in its customer base. Almost all customers of Maynilad enjoy 24-hour uninterrupted water supply at an average pressure of seven pounds per square inch.  Water Losses  When Maynilad was re-privatized in 2007, the company was losing some 1,500 million liters of treated water per day. This translated to a Non- Revenue Water (NRW) level of 67%‚Äîmeaning two-thirds of the potable water it was producing was being lost. Most of the water‚Äîsome 75% ‚Äîwas lost through the old and inefficient distribution system Maynilad inherited from the government and its previous owners. In fact, the company‚Äôs pipe network is considered the oldest in Asia, some dating back to the time when the Philippines was still under the Spanish rule. While a massive pipe replacement program would have dramatically reduced its NRW in a short amount of time, Maynilad decided against it because it would ultimately result in significantly higher tariffs for its customers. Instead, it invested in its human resources, technical equipment, engineering methodologies and internal procedures so it could serve more people through less water losses. After launching what was dubbed as the ‚Äúlargest NRW management project in the world‚Äù, Maynilad has successfully brought down its NRW level to an all-time low of 27% by the end of 2018. In 2017, Maynilad plugged a total of 26,792 pipe leaks within its concessionaire area thus bringing the company‚Äôs total leak repairs to 316,757 since its re- privatization in 2007. Maynilad‚Äôs water loss reduction efforts have been recognized by various organizations including the International Water Association and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN Habitat).  Wastewater Management  Aside from water services, Maynilad also manages wastewater in the West Zone in the form of sewerage and sanitation services. Sewerage services involve the treatment of wastewater conveyed via a sewer network to Maynilad‚Äôs sewage treatment plants. At present, only residents and establishments in Ayala Alabang Village in Muntinlupa City, Magallanes Village in Makati, portions of Manila, Malabon, and Navotas, Project 7 and Project 8 in Quezon City, and portions of South Caloocan may connect to Maynilad‚Äôs sewerage system. Meanwhile, Maynilad offers sanitation services or septic tank cleaning to households that are not yet connected to its sewer system. Septic tank cleaning or desludging comes at no extra cost for residential and semi- business account holders, and is conducted every five to seven years. ==Ownership== * Metro Pacific Investments Corporation: 52.8% * DMCI Holdings, Inc.: 25.24% * Marubeni Corporation: 21.54% ==See also== * Water supply and sanitation in the Philippines ==References * Category:Water companies of the Philippines Category:Water supply and sanitation in Metro Manila Category:Companies based in Quezon City Category:1997 establishments in the Philippines ","title":"Maynilad Water Services"},{"id":"35241119","text":"The Tour of Elk Grove was an annual bicycle race held in Elk Grove Village, IL in the United States.

It was written by the English archaeologist Andrew Reynolds of the UCL Institute of Archaeology, based on the work which he had undertaken for his PhD, completed in 1998. The book was first published by Oxford University Press in 2009 as a part of their series on \\"Medieval History and Archaeology\\", edited by John Blair and Helena Hamerow. The book has been acknowledged as providing archaeological data to back up the historical records regarding Medieval European beliefs in the undead. ==Background== Reynolds' investigation into Anglo-Saxon deviant burials emerged from his PhD thesis, which he undertook at the Institute of Archaeology, University College London, and completed in 1998. He decided not to publish his findings immediately afterward, because more information on this issue was coming to light as a result of further excavation. From 2002 to 2003, Reynolds undertook a year of study leave to undertake new research in this area.Reynolds 2009. p. vii. ==Synopsis== The first chapter, \\"Sources, approaches, and contexts\\", takes an interdisciplinary approach by examining the literary evidence from the Anglo-Saxon period regarding the execution and burial of those \\"individuals deemed social outcasts and even feared among the living for their malevolent qualities.\\" Reynolds examines the references to punishment for deviancy within the Anglo-Saxon law codes, before looking at the evidence from charters and place-names referring to places of execution and burial sites. Chapter two, \\"Burials, bodies and beheadings\\", focuses on the archaeological evidence for deviant burials in Anglo-Saxon England, identifying eight specific causes for such funerary deposits: victims of battles, judicial executions, massacres, murder, plague, sacrifice and suicide. For each of these, Reynolds looks at the archaeological evidence that these would each leave behind, before attempting to identify any Anglo-Saxon grave sites that fit into these categories. In the third chapter, \\"Social deviants in a pagan society\\", Reynolds looks at the evidence for deviant burial practices from the fifth to the eighth centuries. Dismissing ideas that crouched, multiple, and shallow burials could be considered \\"deviant\\", he examines prone inhumations, decapitated and amputated bodies, and corpses with evidence of stoning, suggesting that these are best categorised as examples of deviant burial. ==Reception and reviews== Academic reviews Catherine Hills of the University of Cambridge positively reviewed Reynolds' book for the journal Antiquity, announcing it to be a \\"significant contribution\\" to the study of both Anglo-Saxon England and of the archaeology of burial and justice. She noted that Reynold's ideas appeared \\"less novel\\" than they should be because he had already presented many of his conclusions in published papers and talks, and that the tome contains a number of traces betraying its origins as a doctoral dissertation. Ultimately noting that its last two chapters represent \\"an impressive piece of scholarship\\", she considers his arguments to be \\"persuasive and original\\".Hills 2010. Reynold's work reviewed a more critical review in The English Historical Review, authored by Tom Lambert of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.https://www.sid.cam.ac.uk/aboutus/people/person.html?crsid=tbl25 Lambert noted that he wished that clearer diagrams had been included in the section where Reynolds discusses family plots, and went on to criticise the book for what he argued was a circular argument, that Reynolds uses \\"his handlist to argue for the very criteria that were used to construct it.\\" Lambert argued that the fifth chapter was unable to unite the separate analysis into a \\"coherent whole\\" and that, despite \\"some interesting ideas\\", Reynolds' ultimate conclusion was rushed and \\"inexplicably terse\\". Summing up his review, Lambert noted that this was an \\"important book\\" which represented a \\"necessary and stimulating\\" read, but that its flaws meant that it had to be read \\"very carefully\\".Lambert 2012. Wider influence Writing a review of Claude Lecouteux's book The Return of the Dead for the journal Preternature, Stephen Gordon of the University of Manchester made reference to Reynold's book, noting that he \\"devotes considerable attention to the relationship between the revenant narratives and unusual burial practices\\", in this way providing supporting evidence for many of Lecouteux's claims.Gordon 2012. p. 160. Reynolds' ideas were also positively discussed in the paper \\"Living On: Ancestors and the Soul\\", authored by Alexandra Sanmark, a Post Doctoral Research Associate at the Millennium Institute Centre for Nordic Studies and Lecturer at the University of Western Australia's Department of History. Published in the anthology Signals of Belief in Early England (2010), co- edited by Sanmark, Sarah Semple and Martin Carver, Sanmark noted that Reynold's work provided good archaeological evidence for a belief in the malevolent dead in Early Medieval England.Sanmark 2010. pp. 172-174. ==References== Footnotes Bibliography : : : : : Category:2009 non- fiction books Category:Academic studies of ritual and magic Category:Archaeology books Category:Oxford University Press books ","title":"Anglo-Saxon Deviant Burial Customs"},{"id":"35241136","text":"Hemlock Grove is a 2012 Horror-thriller debut novel by American author Brian McGreevy. The book was released on March 27, 2012 through Farrar, Straus and Giroux and is set in the fictional town of Hemlock Grove, Pennsylvania. A graphic novel tie-in and a television series based on the events in the book have been produced. Critical reception for the book was mixed, with The New York Times giving an ambivalent review. ==Synopsis== The book is set in the town of Hemlock Grove, Pennsylvania. The town is a mixture of extreme wealth and poverty, as the closing of the town's steel mill (owned by the Godfrey family) many years earlier cost a lot of people their jobs. Now the town's main sources of employment are the Hemlock Acres Hospital and the Godfrey Institute for Biomedical Technologies. Run by the powerful Godfrey family, the institute is rumored to have several sinister experiments take place within. The town's rumor mill turns even more twisted when a teenage girl is brutally killed during a full moon. Peter Rumancek, a 17-year-old Romanian gypsy boy who just moved to Hemlock Grove with his mother, is suspected of the crimes by some of the townsfolk and is also rumored to be a werewolf. While he secretly really is a werewolf, he isn't the actual killer and along with Roman, the heir to the Godfrey estate (who Peter realizes is an upir, though Roman does not know it himself), they set out to find the killer. The two become unlikely friends, much to the chagrin of each boy's mother. As the two grow closer, Roman's mother Olivia resumes an affair with her late husband's brother, Dr. Norman Godfrey. At several points during the novel Norman tries to break away from Olivia but ultimately fails due to his desire for her, despite him remembering several warnings from his brother about how Olivia emotionally preys on people. While Roman has known about the affair all along (but doesn't discuss it with anyone), his monstrous-looking, yet highly intelligent and kind sister Shelley becomes aware of the affair later. She openly says so in one of the e-mails she exchanges with her uncle Norman (on a regular basis since he is her therapist). The murders continue in the town, and more people start to believe the teenage girl Christina who has been accusing Peter of being both a werewolf and the killer from the start. Christina also discovers the remains of one of the murdered girls, which seems to push her into insanity and causes her hair to turn white. Tensions continue to rise, especially after Peter begins a relationship with Roman's cousin Letha (Norman's daughter), who believes that she was recently impregnated by an angel. Their relationship ultimately breaks the friendship between Peter and Roman, prompting Roman to try to attack the Godfrey Institute and its lead scientist Dr. Pryce. Roman falls into a coma due to Pryce's attempt to keep him from harming Pryce or the experiment for Project Ouroboros. He later awakens and reconciles with Peter, just in time for them to launch another search for the killer. This fails due to Chasseur, a woman operating for a secret group known as the \\"Order of the Dragon\\", shooting a dart into Peter in his wolf form, knocking him out for the rest of the night of the full moon. During this time the twin daughters of the town sheriff are killed, which prompts a mob to ransack Peter's trailer. Neither Peter nor his mother are injured, as Peter is saved by Olivia interfering and Peter's mother was called away due to premonitions from a cousin. Ultimately Chasseur is killed by Olivia (leaving the clean-up to Dr. Pryce) and Peter and Roman discover that the murderer is actually Christina, the girl who accused Peter of the murders. She turned herself into a werewolf by drinking water from one of the tracks left by Peter while he was in wolf form. Unable to control her actions as a werewolf or truly remember all that occurred, Christina's mental state deteriorated and caused her to become a \\"vargulf\\", an insane werewolf. Due to her insanity she attacked anyone she saw as being sexually promiscuous due to her own confusion over her burgeoning sexuality. Peter and Christina fight to the death in their wolf forms. Peter miraculously survives, but Shelley, who threw herself into the fight to avenge Christina's last victim, is shot by the Sheriff because he sees her holding Christina's (now human again) body. Shelley runs off, not to be seen again. Six months after the fight, Letha goes into labor and dies in the process (the baby apparently being stillborn), leaving her father Norman distraught as well as prompting Peter and his mother to leave town since there was nothing truly holding them there. Being abandoned by Peter leaves Roman in an extremely emotional state. The final part of the book is told mostly from Olivia's point of view, revealing that centuries ago she was impregnated by a gypsy she tried to run away with as a young girl. The man abandoned her shortly after they escaped (taking her jewels with him), and she was found a few days later, bloody, from having cut off the tail she had (the origin of the scar on her lower back). She was brought home, and turned into an unnatural beauty over the course of her pregnancy. Now resentful of any gypsy, she gave up the child to grow up with a lowborn old swineherd named Rumancek, showing that the family is descended from Olivia. She also muses that while she married JR Godfrey, she fell in love with his brother Norman, who actually fathered Roman. At Roman's 18th birthday, Olivia takes him to Shelley's attic where he discovers Letha's (not actually stillborn) baby. With Olivia's extaz powers (which is the mind- controlling power Roman has used throughout the book too, without being taught), she makes her son remember that it was him who had sex with Letha (her mind having \\"made up\\" the \\"angel\\" to cope with this). Roman then slits his wrists to \\"not let his mother win\\" but this actually finishes his transformation; he grows fangs and it is insinuated that he drinks from Letha's - and his - baby. ==Development== McGreevy spent six years writing Hemlock Grove and the book was rejected by six publishers and eight agents before it was picked up by Farrar, Straus & Giroux in 2010. Of the writing process for the book, McGreevy stated that he was somewhat inspired by Angela Carter's The Bloody Chamber in that he saw that he \\"[doesn't] have to be trying to put myself in a box that I don't particularly have the talent for\\". McGreevy also drew from his experiences in high school and considers the book's setting as a Through the Looking Glass version of his hometown of Pittsburgh. He also commented that while the characters of Roman and Shelley were derived from the fictional characters of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Bram Stoker's Dracula, he drew more from the films based on these characters and from Greek mythology as a whole. ==Series development== Graphic novel In March 2012 McGreevy released an online graphic novel set in the Hemlock Grove universe, entitled Hemlock Grove: Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire. The graphic novel is a prequel to the events in the main novel and focuses on the time leading up to the suicide of JR Godfrey. The graphic novel shows the building of the biotech facility as well as how Olivia met and seduced both Godfrey brothers. It also highlights Olivia's boredom and frustration with the utilitarian world of JR Godfrey, as well as gives some detail on the reanimation of Shelley. Sequel Shortly after the initial release of Hemlock Grove McGreevy commented that he had almost completed a second Hemlock Grove novel and had prepared an outline for a third entry in the series. However, in April 2013 McGreevy indicated in an article with the Toledo Blade that he had not yet begun writing any sequels to the book and later stated on Reddit that there were no plans for any further books in the series. ==Television series adaptation== In December 2011 it was reported that Netflix had ordered a thirteen episode series based upon Hemlock Grove, which was unreleased at that point in time. The project was officially announced in March 2012 and Eli Roth was announced to be directing.WonderCon Interview: Eli Roth On Hemlock Grove's Werewolf Transformation, Italian Horror Connection & Mainstream Gore Filming was initially set to take place in the Pittsburgh area, but was later moved to Toronto due to misunderstandings with the Pennsylvania Film Tax Credit program. The show was released to Netflix on April 19, 2013 and stars Famke Janssen, Bill Skarsg√•rd, and Landon Liboiron. In June 2013 Netflix confirmed that they would be renewing the show for a second season and in September 2014 they confirmed that the show had been picked up for a third and final season. ==References== Category:2012 American novels Category:2010s horror novels Category:Fictional populated places in Pennsylvania Category:Werewolf novels Category:American vampire novels Category:American horror novels Category:American thriller novels Category:Books with cover art by Rodrigo Corral Category:Novels adapted into television shows Category:2012 debut novels ","title":"Hemlock Grove"},{"id":"35241148","text":"\\"The Swarm\\" is a single by British band You Me at Six.

It is a linear settlement situated in the valley of the Mally Brook along the A466 road between Monmouth and Hereford. ==History== Grist Castle Wood The name Buckholt derives from words meaning \\"beech wood\\", and much of the area around the village remains wooded on steeply sloping valley sides. The local woods contain evidence of Neolithic settlement, and Bronze Age and Roman material has also been found. Grist Castle Wood, rising above the valley to the east and adjoining Orles Wood, is thought to have been the site of a small fortification commanding the strategically important road between Monmouth and Hereford. In 1248 the Buckholt area was owned by Monmouth Priory and the local lord John of Monmouth gave the monks certain rights and privileges in relation to the woodland. Buckholt Old Mill Farm is the site of a mediaeval corn mill owned by the Priory; the mill remained operational until the late 19th century. The area came into the possession of the Duke of Beaufort in 1682. The Gwent Village Book, section on Buckholt, reproduced at VisitorUK.com. Accessed 27 March 2012 Houses built in the valley in the 18th and 19th centuries were mainly occupied by charcoal burners and were constructed from local timber and stone. Charcoal burning was an important local activity until the 1890s. Building stone was provided by local quarries, including Callow Quarry which produces red sandstone. Stone from the quarry was used to build Haberdashers' Schools in Monmouth and for restoring the town wall at Hereford. The quarry was taken over in 2007 by Black Mountain Quarries, based at Pontrilas, and remains operational. ADF, Expanding Company Completes the Hat Trick!, 3 September 2007.

The Old Inn at Manson Cross was built in 1760 and is said to have been used by highwaymen. The Plough Inn at Buckholt was used by charcoal burners and millers. Both pubs have now been converted into private houses. The village hall was built in 1929 by public subscription. It continues to host a wide range of village activities. Farms in the area include Great Manson Farm, southwest of Manson Lane. ==References== Category:Villages in Monmouthshire ","title":"Buckholt, Monmouthshire"},{"id":"35241256","text":"we folk of paradys, in Edinburgh with all merynes. A depiction of Edinburgh by John Slezer. The Dregy Of Dunbar also known as Dumbaris Dirige to the King is a humorous poem in Scots and Latin composed by William Dunbar (born 1459 or 1460).W. Mackay Mackenzie, The Poems of William Dunbar, The Mercat Press, 1990. at an unknown date. The Dregy is apparently an appeal to James IV of Scotland asking him to return to Edinburgh from an extended period of residence in Stirling in order to make life more pleasant for his courtiers. It takes the form of a parody of the Office of the Dead. This ritual was a prayer for the benefit of souls in Purgatory intended to help them into Heaven. Thus, Stirling is comically compared to purgatory and Edinburgh to Heaven. The unflattering comparison is continued by the poet throughout the work. Stirling is repeatedly depicted as being dull, austere and uncomfortable when compared to the sophisticated pleasures of the capital. The text is preserved in the Maitland Folio Manuscript and the Bannatyne Manuscript. In the latter it is subtitled Dumbaris dirige to the king bydand ouir lang in Stirling.The full text with notes at TEAMS ==Synopsis== The Introduction Out of pity, the courtiers of Edinburgh, 'here in heaven's glory' are writing to their fellows in Stirling 'where neither pleasure nor delight is'. :We that ar heir in hevynnis glorie, :To you that ar in purgatorie, :Commendis us on hartlie wys, :I mene we folk of paradys. :In Edinburgh with all merynes, :To yow at Striveling in distres, :Quhair nowdir plesour nor delyt is, :For pietie this epistell wrytis. The Stirling courtiers are addressed as if they were 'hermits and anchorites that combine penance with dining'. :O ye heremytis and ankirsadillis :That takkis your pennance at your tabillis :And eitis no meit restorative :Nor drinkis no wyne confortative :Nor aill, bot that is thin and small, :With few coursis into your hall, In addition to their meagre diet, they have no good company nor any entertainment. :But cumpany of lordis and knychtis, :Or ony uther gudlie wychtis, :Solitar walking your alone, :Seing nothing bot stok and stone. The people of Edinburgh declare that, in order to bring the Stirling folk out of their 'painfull purgatory', they will begin a Dirge to 'deliver them from their annoyance' and 'bring them soon to Edinburgh's joy to be merry among us'. :Out of your panefull purgatorie, :To bring yow to the blys and glorie, :Of Edinburcht, the myrrie town. :We sall begin ane cairfull sown, :Ane dirige devoit and meik, :The Lord of blys doing beseik :Yow to delyver out of your noy :And bring yow sone to Edinburgh joy, :For to be merye amangis us. :The dirige begynnis thus, The Dregy Slezer's depiction of Stirling castle. The dregy consists of three lessons and responses The pretence of being addressed to the whole court is abandoned. Subsequently, the language is ambiguous as to whether it is addressing the entire court or the king alone. The First Lesson and Response The first lesson prays that 'all the heavenly court divine' will deliver the court from the 'pain and woe' of Stirling unto the many virtues of the capital. :Lectio prima :The Fader, the Sone, the Holie Gaist, :The blissit Marie, virgen chaist, :Of angellis all the ordour nyne, :And all the hevinlie court divyne, :Sone bring yow fra the pyne and wo, :Of Striveling, everie court manis foo, :Agane to Edinburchtis joy and blys, :Quhair wirschip, welthe, and weilfair is, :Play, plesance eik, and honestie. :Say ye amen, for chirritie. The first response reinforces the message. :Responsio :Tak consolatioun in your payne, :In tribulatioun tak consolatioun, :Out of vexatioun cum hame agayne, :Tak consolatioun in your payne. :Out of distres of Stirling town :To Edinburgh blys God mak you bown. The Second Lesson and Response The second lesson makes another appeal for deliverance for the courtiers of Stirling. Various senior heavenly figures are invoked. The fine foods and wines available in Edinburgh are then dwelt upon at length. :Lectio secunda :Patriarchis, prophetis, apostillis deir, :Confessouris, virgynis, and martyris cleir, :And all the saitt celestiall, :Devoitlie we upone thame call, :That sone out of your paynis fell, :Ye may in hevin heir with us duell, :To eit swan, cran, peirtrik, and pluver, :And everie fische that swowmis in rever, :To drink withe us the new fresche wyne :That grew apone the revar of Ryne, :Fresche fragrant claretis out of France, :Of Angeo and of Orliance, :With mony ane cours of grit daynt√©. :Say ye amen, for chirrit√©. The second response appeals to God and Saint Giles, a favourite saint of Edinburgh, to convey the Stirling court to 'solace and joy'. :Responsio :God and Sanct Geill heir yow convoy, :Baythe sone and weill, God and Sanct Geill, :To sonce and seill, solace and joy, :God and Sanct Geill heir yow convoy. :Out of Stirling paynis fell, :In Edinburgh joy sone mot ye dwell. The Third Lesson and Response The third lesson appeals to all the saints. It is the longest and most elaborate of the three. The remaining pretence of being addressed to the whole court seems to end. Dunbar appears to be speaking directly to his king. :Lectio tertia :We pray to all the sanctis in Hevin, :That ar abuif the sternis sevin, :Yow to delyver out of your pennance, :That ye may sone play, sing, and dance :And into Edinburgh mak gud cheir, :Quhair welthe and weilfair is, but weir. Dunbar writes that he intends to visit Stirling, like Gabriel, to inform the inhabitants of 'purgatory' that their 'tribulation' was over, allowing them to pass to 'heaven'. An angel releasing souls from purgatory. Ludovico Carracci. Sixteenth century. :And I that dois your paynis discryve, :Thinkis for to visie you belyve, :Nocht in desert with yow to duell, :Bot as the angell Gabriell, :Dois go betweyne fra Hevynis glorie, :To thame that ar in Purgatorie, :And in thair tribulatioun, :To gif thame consolatioun, :And schaw thame quhone thair pane is past, :Thay sall to Hevin cum at the last, :And how nane servis to have sweitnes :That never taistit bittirnes. A final appeal is made to abandon 'penance and abstinence' and to return before the start of Christmas celebrations. :And thairfoir how sould ye considdir, :Of Edinburgh blys quhone ye cum hiddir, :Bot gif ye taistit had befoir, :Of Stirling toun the paynis soir :And thairfoir tak in patience, :Your pennance and your abstinence, :And ye sall cum or Yule begyn, :Into the blys that we ar in, :Quhilk grant the glorious Trinit√©. :Say ye amen, for chirrit√©. The third response makes yet another dig at the 'hideous hell' of Stirling and its allegedly poor foods. The king is twice urged to 'cum hame'. :Responsio :Cum hame and duell no mair in Stirling, :Fra hyddows hell cum hame and duell, :Quhair fische to sell is nane bot spyrling, :Cum hame and duell na mair in Stirling. The Conclusion The poem concludes with a mock Latin prayer. In a style reminiscent of the Goliards, its language echoes that of the Office of the Dead as well as that of the Lord's Prayer and the Requiem. Stirling continues to be vilified for its gloom when compared to Edinburgh. The translations given are those of the twentieth-century scholar of Dunbar, William Mackay Mackenzie. :Et ne nos inducas in tentationem de Stirling, :Sed libera nos a malo eiusdem. :(Lead us not into the temptation of Stirling, but deliver us from its evil.) :Requiem Edinburgi dona eis, Domine, :Et lux ipsius luceat eis. :(Give them the rest of Edinburgh, Lord, and let its light shine upon them.) :A porta tristitiae de Stirling, :Erue, Domine, animas et corpora eorum. :(From the dolourous gate of Stirling deliver, Lord, their souls and bodies.) :Credo gustare vinum Edinburgi, :In villa viventium. :(I believe that they will yet taste the wine of Edinburgh in the land of the living.) :Requiescant statim in Edinburgo. Amen. :(May they rest in Edinburgh at once. Amen.) Fresche fragrant claretis. :Domine, exaudi orationem meam, :Et clamor meus ad te veniat. :Oremus. :(Lord, hear my prayer and let my cry come unto thee! Let us pray.) :Deus qui iustos et corde humiles ex eorum tribulatione, :liberare dignatus es. Libera famulos tuos apud villam, :de Stirling versantes a penis et tristitiis eiusdem, et ad :Edinburgi gaudia feliciter perducas. Amen. :(Oh God, who deignest to free the just and humble-of-heart from all their tribulation, :liberate thy children who live in the town of Stirling, from its pains and sorrows, :and bring them to the joys of Edinburgh, that Stirling may be at rest.) ==Historical Context== After Edinburgh, Stirling was the residence most favoured by James IV.Norman Macdougall, The Stewart Dynasty in Scotland, James IV, Tuckwell press, 1997. Stirling Castle underwent major building work during his reign. His mistress Margaret Drummond had resided at the castle in 1496 and, after Drummond's death in 1502 until 1508, their illegitimate daughter was raised there. The king spent regular Easter retreats at the burgh's Franciscan friary, which he had founded. Given that the Franciscans were famous for their frugal Mendicant conduct, it seems possible that the poem's many references to penance and abstinence are not entirely comical. ==References== Category:Poetry by William Dunbar Category:Scottish poems Category:Scottish literature Category:Medieval poetry Category:Poetry of the Bannatyne Manuscript ","title":"The Dregy Of Dunbar"},{"id":"35241257","text":"Hoseynabad-e Beglar Beygi (, also Romanized as ·∏®oseynƒÅbƒÅd-e Beglar Beygƒ´ and ·∏®oseynƒÅbƒÅd-e Bƒ´glarbeygƒ´) is a village in Dashtabi-ye Gharbi Rural District, Dashtabi District, Buin Zahra County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

After the main course Miles goes upstairs, locks himself in the spare bedroom and refuses to leave indefinitely. Eventually becoming a minor celebrity when crowds gather outside the window, Miles highlights the effects of a consumerist and celebrity-based culture as various attempts are made to capitalise on his presence within the room. The name 'Miles' is replaced by 'Milo' as Garth is henceforth positioned as some form of new spiritual leader for the 'disenfranchised'. The book is divided into four main narrative parts: *There : Tells of Anna Hardie, a recently unemployed Scottish woman who has quit her job working with asylum seekers, of whom she 'had to make not matter so much'. The hosts of the party (Gen and Eric Lee) find her name and address in Garth's wallet and contact her in the hope that she can persuade Miles to leave. Anna recalls her contact with Miles when in 1980 as a 17-year-old she and Miles travelled together on a coach tour of Europe as winners in a short-story competition. *But : In which Mark, a gay photo-researcher who invited Miles to the party mourns an old lover and hears his dead mother speaking to him in rhymes. *For : Is set in the head of May Young, an elderly lady in a care home suffering from dementia, who has annual contact with Miles on the date of her daughter (and Miles' girlfriend) Jennifer's death. *The : Revolves around Brooke, the daughter of two post-graduate researchers who, like Miles, attends the Lees' infamous dinner party as an unexpected guest. At the novel's close Brooke finds the door of the spare room unlocked and goes inside to chat to Miles. Brooke asks Miles to write her a story in which his younger self and older self meet. She asks him 'what story would you tell your self and what story would your self tell you?' Miles' completed short story is positioned at the very beginning of Smith's novel. ==References Reviews *The story of a dinner guest who refuses to leave develops into a satire on the way we live now in Ali Smith's enjoyably playful new novel review by Sarah Churchwell for The Observer *Lucy Daniel marvels at There But For The, Ali Smith‚Äôs agile, funny new novel review from The Daily Telegraph *After Hiding, He Becomes a Celebrity review from The New York Times *There But For The By Ali Smith review from The Independent *Ali Smith's There But For The is a seriously playful puzzle of a novel review by Alex Clark for The Guardian *Ali Smith is a master of stylistic daring, writes Nicholas Lezard review by Nicholas Lezard for The Guardian Interviews * Ali Smith discusses a debt to Franz Kafka, the nature of celebrity culture and the importance of outsiders *Interview: Ali Smith - There but for the Category:2011 British novels Category:Scottish novels Category:Novels set in London Category:Royal Borough of Greenwich Category:Fiction set in 2009 Category:Fiction set in 2010 Category:Hamish Hamilton books Category:Hawthornden Prize-winning works ","title":"There But For The"},{"id":"35241347","text":"Shadmahan may refer to: * Shadman, Qazvin, Qazvin Province * Shad Mehan, Tehran Province ","title":"Shadmahan"},{"id":"35241349","text":"{ class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"font-size: 90%;\\" + All-Ireland Senior Club Camogie Championship 1973 ! style=\\"background: #BFD7FF; text-align: center\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Championship Details - Dates colspan=\\"2\\" - Competitors colspan=\\"2\\" - Sponsor colspan=\\"2\\" - ! style=\\"background: #BFD7FF; text- align: center\\" colspan=\\"3\\" All-Ireland Senior Club Camogie Championship winners - Winners colspan=\\"2\\" Oranmore (Galway) (1st title) - Captain colspan=\\"2\\" Nono McHugh - Manager colspan=\\"2\\" - ! style=\\"background: #BFD7FF; text-align: center\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  All-Ireland Senior Club Camogie Championship Runners-up - Runners-up colspan=\\"2\\" St Paul‚Äôs (Kk) - Captain colspan=\\"2\\" - Manager colspan=\\"2\\" - Matches played colspan=\\"2\\" } The 1973 All-Ireland Senior Club Camogie Championship for the leading clubs in the women's team field sport of camogie was won by Oranmore (Gal), who defeated St Paul‚Äôs (Kk) in the final, played at Nowlan Park. 978-1-908591-00-5All Ireland club championships on Camogie.ie ==Arrangements== The championship was organised on the traditional provincial system used in Gaelic Games since the 1880s, with St Patrick‚Äôs Creggan, based in Randalstown, County Antrim and Thurles winning the championships of the other two provinces.

Anne Sheehy stretched the Stacks lead with a goal that was negated by a goal by Edna Webb, but Anne Sheehy availed of a defensive error to goal again and leave Stacks ahead by 3-1 to 2-0 at the interval. Stack‚Äôs fourth goal by Mary Sherlock soon after the resumption, made the issue reasonably safe for Stacks. Portglenone, thanks to some magnificent play by Mair√©ad McAtamney at midfield, had their chances in this half but failed to make any impression in the sound Stacks defence and the only other score went to Stacks, a point from a thirty.Report of final in Irish Press, March 11, 1974, competition of 1973Report of final in Irish Independent, March 11, 1974, competition of 1973Report of final in Irish Times, March 11, 1974, competition of 1973 Agnes Hourigan wrote in the Irish Press: > In a well contested final that produced some very entertaining passages, > there was not a great deal between the sides, but Austin Stacks were far the > better combined side.

A pothole is a circular depression on the river bed carved out of solid rock. It is formed by a kind of drilling action as pebbles are caught in eddy currents and whisked around within a small natural crack or hollow. As time passes, the drilling action enlarges the hollow to form a pothole. Potholes are commonly found below waterfalls or rapids where hydraulic action is a significant process. ==Geological interest== These naturally occurring potholes are of great interest to geologists, as they're quite uncommon. The best-known kettle holes in Taiwan are a mass of indents in the exposed bed of the Keelung River at the town of Nuannuan, near Keelung City, although part of their fame is surely due to their lying right beside a busy road. Keelung River near Nuannuan has a narrower river channel and thus faster flowing water and turbulents which results in the formation of potholes. Riverbed potholes normally take many hundreds years to form and it is an extremely important geological feature. The formation phenomena provokes wide research interests in fluid dynamics, landscape, geology, climate, hydrological and rock studies. Its rarity also serve as an invaluable educational resource for everybody. ==Guo-Gang Community== There are around 4400 people living in Nuannuan district forming a Guo-Gang Community (). The people of Guo-Gang community plays an important part in protecting the potholes in Nuannuan. These potholes were badly damaged when the nearby highways were built 12 years ago. The highways are due for servicing in 2012, and therefore, the Guo-Gang community has been doing many activities hoping to raise government's awareness of how valuable these potholes are to hope reduce the overall damage. ==Picture gallery== File:Nuannuan Pothole.jpgNuannuan Pothole in 2010 File:Nuannuan Pothole 2.jpgNuannuan Pothole in 2010 File:Nuannuan Pothole 3.jpgNuannuan Pothole in 2010 File:Nuannuan Pothole 4.jpgNuannuan Pothole in 2010 File:Guogang Community Development Association members at Keelung Cultural Center 20110904.jpgGuo-Gang Community == References == Category:Karst caves Category:Geology of Taiwan ","title":"Keelung Nuannuan pothole"},{"id":"35241434","text":"Angus MacKinnon was a Scottish footballer, who played for Queen's Park and represented Scotland.

It was the first news agency owned and managed by Indians. Beset by dubious business acumen from the outset, and beholden to those who financed it, the agency failed to obtain substantial support from Indian-owned press and hence closed down in 1935. It was revived briefly between 1945 and 1947 before being stifled by the government of the newly independent country. It was at various times a supporter of the Swaraj Party and, later, of the Responsive Cooperation Party, as well as various business interests. ==Background== In the three decades prior to independence of India, the Reuters news agency and its affiliates, such as the Associated Press of India (API), Eastern News Agency and Indian News Agency Service, had more or less complete control of newswire services in India. They supplied news services to the Government of the British Raj in that country, as well as from India to the international media, and vice versa. Sadanand had worked for API and left that arm of the Reuters monopoly soon after being dismayed by government suppression of reportage concerning the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919. Thereafter, he worked for the Independent newspaper in Allahabad and then for the Rangoon Times in Burma, but he held a desire to break the monopoly, as did Gandhi and others involved in the Indian independence movement. ==Formation== The Free Press of India (FPI) was the first news agency in the country to be both owned and managed by Indians. Sadanand said that he had planned its creation in 1923 and that it was actually established in 1925. K. M. Shrivastava, a professor of news agency journalism, notes that Sadanand's account of the origins is one of several differing versions. Milton Israel notes late 1924, but also an announcement of the FPI office opening that was published by The Bombay Chronicle on 8 January 1925. Sadanand had issued an appeal in September 1924, and earlier in that year he had approached Congress with his ideas and costings. His appeal noted that he proposed \\"An independent news agency that will collect and disseminate news with accuracy and impartiality from the Indian viewpoint [which is] a long-felt public want\\". One difficulty that would have to be surmounted, as the Chronicle noted, was that among all the various nationalist factions there was no common \\"Indian viewpoint\\"; Israel describes the extant monopoly as \\"efficient, dependable, and generally accurate\\". Another difficulty was to be the poor financial acumen of Sadanand, who envisaged that the FPI could be financially self-supporting by its second year of operation. Experienced newspaper businessmen, such as J. B. Petit and F. H. Holsinger, foresaw a much longer period of subsidy being required, as well as little chance of success because there were neither sufficient newspapers in print to justify another agency nor means to prevent the existing agencies from temporarily engaging in a price war to see off the new business. J. K. Singh was later to describe him as a great journalist but a poor business manager and a \\"sad failure\\". Although Petit served briefly on the board of directors, he refused to invest. Others did provide funds and the FPI became beholden to its principal financial backers, being various businesses and political factions. The Swaraj Party was a major initial supporter but when one member, M. R. Jayakar, who was also a director of FPI, shifted his support from that to the Responsive Cooperation movement after October 1925, so too did the FPI. Other early board members included GD Birla and P. Thakurdas. Israel writes that the FPI since its establishment \\"had been run by a coalition of Bombay industrialists and journalists\\". A primary stimulus in the formation and growth of the nationalist-supporting FPI was probably the \\"rupee ratio\\" debate that pitted the colonial government against Indian nationalists. This debate concerned whether it was better to devalue the rupee or restrict the amount of rupees in circulation, together with the aim of maintaining a fixed ratio between the rupee and sterling of 1s. 6d. Any outcome of the debate would affect business but Israel also says that Sadanand was already aware of the constraints acting on the press as a result of the repressive laws of the British Empire. Newspapers could not carry factual reports of what Shrivastava calls \\"official excesses\\" even though FPI supplied them. To counteract this problem, he started his own newspaper, first as a cyclostyled news bulletin, the Free Press Bulletin, and finally The Free Press Journal on 13 June 1930. The Bulletin was a short-lived affair that had become a supplement to the Advocate of India Sunday newspaper as early as 1926, due to the inability to finance it as a standalone publication. ==Effect== The potential of the FPI as a new competitor was sufficient to cause the management at Reuters to institute various administrative changes in order to meet the perceived challenge. Sadanand claimed that the FPI \\"had the support of the entire national press of India while it was functioning. It maintained a comprehensive internal service. It was the first Indian news agency which organised and maintained an effective world news service to the press of India during the years 1932‚Äì35\\". Shrivastava notes that, despite Sadanand's own description, the venture was not a success and was not in fact supported by the press of India, however worthy his aims may have been. Sadanand was an affluent man and could afford to take risks, which was evidenced by his agency frequently forfeiting security deposits in acts of defiance, but the combined effects of a lack of general support, the opposition of the government of the British Raj and the vested interests of established news media caused it to close in 1935. ==Revival== The FPI was revived in 1945 and aimed then to provide feeds of international news to the Indian press, for which purpose it established correspondents in Batavia, Cairo, London, Nanking, New York and Singapore. The revival was abandoned in 1947 when the necessary teleprinter lines were denied to the organisation. The FPI had angered Sardar Patel, the Home Minister, by circulating a news story, on the day after independence of India, that revealed unauthorised details of military movements. Patel thereafter denied FPI the facilities that it needed in order to operate. Sadanand had hoped to resurrect the venture once more when the new government of the now-independent India had settled into place but in fact the FPI was not revived. Sadanand was one of the seven initial shareholders of the Press Trust of India, which was started in 1948. ==References== ;Notes ;Citations Category:Mass media in India Category:News agencies based in India Category:Newspapers published in India ","title":"Free Press of India"},{"id":"35241478","text":"The mythology of Indonesia is very diverse, the Indonesian people consisting of hundreds of ethnic groups, each with their own myths and legends that explain the origin of their people, the tales of their ancestors and the demons or deities in their belief systems. The tendency to syncretize by overlying older traditions with newer foreign ideas has occurred. For example, the older ancestral mythology might be merged with foreign mythology, such as Hindu, Islam, or Christian biblical mythology. ==Foreign influences== Some native Indonesian ethnic groups that were isolated from the rest of the world until recent centuries have their own native myths and gods. These native mythologies are relatively free from foreign influences, such as Torajans, Nias, Bataks, Dayaks and Papuans. By contrast, Javanese, Balinese, and to some degree Sundanese were influenced by Hindu-Buddhist Indian mythology as early as the 1st century CE. Hindu gods, legends and epics such as Ramayana and Mahabharata were adopted and adapted into a uniquely local form. Many Hindu- Buddhist mythical beings have a role in Javanese and Balinese mythology, including of Hindu gods and heroes, devatas, asuras, apsaras (known as hapsari or bidadari), kinnaras, etc., while native gods of nature such as Semar, Dewi Sri, and Nyai Loro Kidul are either given identified as their Hindu counterpart or incorporated into a Java-Bali Hindu pantheon unknown in India. For example, native rice goddess Dewi Sri are identified with Lakshmi the shakti of Vishnu, and Semar and his sons the Punakawans are incorporated into the epic of Mahabharata in Javanese wayang kulit, as the clown servants of the Pandawas. Several names refer to gods, such as dewa (devas), dewi (devi), dewata (devatas), and in native traditions usually referred to as Batara (male god) and Batari (female goddess). These names are similar to the native Philippines mythology of Bathala and Diwata. After the coming of Islam to the Indonesian archipelago, Islamic mythology especially those dealing with spiritual beings, such as devils, demons, jinns and angels entered Indonesian mythology. In Sumatra, Malay, Aceh and Minangkabau mythology was almost entirely supplanted by Islamic mythology. However, belief in local spirits such as the forest guardian, the ghost of water or haunted places still exists, often associated with a jinn or the tormented soul of a deceased human. ==Creation myth== Creation myths explain the creation of the universe and the world and its lands. They often explain the story of their ancestors. Most native Indonesian ethnic groups, especially those not influenced by other traditions, explain the origin of the universe, gods and deities, as well as their ancestors. Ancient people in Java and Bali believed in an unseen spiritual entity that has supernatural powers identified as Hyangs. This spirit can be either divine or ancestral. The reverence for this spiritual entity can be found in Sunda Wiwitan, Kejawen, and Balinese Hinduism. According to the myth of some ethnic groups in Sulawesi, the earth sat upon the back of gigantic babirusa. An earthquake happened when the boar felt itchy and rubbed its back against a gigantic palm tree. This myth has its counterpart, in the Hindu myth of Varaha, the third avatar of Vishnu as a gigantic boar that carried the world upon his back. Dayak The Dayak indigenous religion, Kaharingan, is a form of animism. The Dayak arose from middle-earth out of a cosmic battle at the beginning of time between a primal couple, a male and female bird/dragon (serpent). Representations of this primal couple are among the most pervasive motifs of Dayak art. The primal mythic conflict ended in a mutual, procreative murder. The body parts became the present universe stage by stage. This primal sacrificial creation of the universe is re-experienced and ultimately harmoniously brought together in the seasons of the year, the interdependence of river (up-stream and down-stream) and land, the tilling of the earth and fall of the rain, the union of male and female, the distinctions between and cooperation of social classes, the wars and trade with foreigners, indeed in all aspects of life, even including tattoos on the body, the lay-out of dwellings and the annual cycle of renewal ceremonies, funeral rites, etc.The best study of a traditional Dayak religion is that of Hans Scharer, Ngaju Religion: The Conception of God among a South Borneo People; translated by Rodney Needham (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1963). The practice of Kaharingan differs from group to group, but shamans, specialists in ecstatic flight, are central to Dayak religion. They bring together the various realms of Heaven (Upper-world), earth and Under-world, for example healing the sick by retrieving their souls while they journey to the Upper-world land of the dead, accompanying and protecting the soul of the dead, presiding over annual renewal and agricultural regeneration festivals, etc.The most detailed study of the shamanistic ritual at funerals is by Waldemar St√∂hr, Der Totenkult der Ngadju Dajak in S√ºd-Borneo. Mythen zum Totenkult und die Texte zum Tantolak Matei (Den Haag: Martinus Nijhoff, 1966). Death rituals are most elaborate when a noble (kamang) dies.Nancy Dowling, \\"Javanization of Indian Art,\\" Indonesia, volume 54 (1992). On particular religious occasions, the spirit is believed to descend to partake in celebration, a mark of honour and respect to past ancestors and blessings for a prosperous future. Batak The Batak creation myth has many versions. Large collections of Batak tales were recorded by European scholars in their own languages (mostly Dutch) beginning in the mid-19th century.Stohr, W. & Zoeta Jadider, P. (1965) \\"Die Religionen Indonesiens.\\" Die Religionen der Menschheit, vol. 5:1, Stuttgart. At the beginning of time there was only the sky with a great sea beneath it. In the sky lived the gods and the sea was the home of a mighty underworld dragon Naga Padoha. The earth did not yet exist and human beings, too, were as yet unknown. At the beginning of creation stands the god Mula Jadi Na Bolon. His origin remains uncertain. A rough translation of the name is the \\"beginning of becoming\\". Everything that exists can be traced to him. Mula Jadi lives in the upper world, which is usually divided into seven levels. His three sons, Batara Guru, Mangalabulan and Soripada were born from eggs laid by a hen fertilized by Mula Jadi. Two swallows act as messengers and helpers to Mula Jadi in his act of creation. Their functions vary in the different versions. Mula Jadi begets three daughters whom he gives as wives for his three sons. Mankind is the result of the union of the three couples. Besides the three sons of Mula Jadi another god, Asiasi, has only unclear place and function. There is some evidence that Asiasi can be seen as the balance and unity of the trinity of gods. The ruler of the underworld, i. e. the primeval sea, is the serpent-dragon Naga Padoha. He too existed before the beginning and seems to be the opponent of Mula Jadi. As ruler of the underworld Naga Padoha also has an important function in the creation of the earth. All these six gods play a minor role in ritual. They do not receive sacrificial offerings from the faithful and no places of sacrifice are built for them. They are merely called on in prayers for help and assistance.Leertouwer, L. (1977) Het beeld van de ziel bij drie Sumatraanse volken. Doctoral dissertation in Theology. Groningen, p. 177. The origin of the earth and of mankind is connected mainly with the daughter of Batara Guru, Sideak Parujar, who is the actual creator of the earth. She flees from her intended husband, the lizard-shaped son of Mangalabulan, and lets herself down on a spun thread from the sky to the middle world, which at that time was a watery waste. She refuses to go back, but feels very unhappy. Out of compassion Mula Jadi sends his granddaughter a handful of earth so that she can find somewhere to live. Sideak Parudjar was ordered to spread out this earth and thus the earth became broad and long. But the goddess was not able to enjoy her rest for long. The earth had been spread out on the head of Naga Padoha, the dragon of the underworld who lived in the water. He groaned under the weight and attempted to get rid of it by rolling around. The earth was softened by water and was almost destroyed. With the help of Mula Jadi and by her own cunning Sideak Parudjar was able to overcome the dragon. She thrust a sword into the body of Naga Padoha up to the hilt and laid him in an iron block. Whenever Naga Padoha twists in its fetters an earthquake occurs. After the lizard-shaped son of Mangalabulan, the husband the gods intended for her, had taken another name and another form, Sideak Parujar marries him. She becomes the mother of twins of opposite sexes. When the two have grown up their divine parents return to the upper world, leaving the couple behind on the earth. Mankind is the result of their incestuous union. The couple settle on Pusuk Buhit, a volcano on the western shore of Lake Toba, and found the village of Si Anjur Mulamula. The mythological ancestor of the Batak, Si Raja Batak is one of their grandchildren. Toraja Torajans indigenous belief system is polytheistic animism, called aluk, or \\"the way\\" (sometimes translated as \\"the law\\"). In the Toraja myth, the ancestors of Torajan people came down from heaven using stairs, which were then used by the Torajans as a communication medium with Puang Matua, the Creator.This Toraja myth was directly translated from the history of Toraja at the official Tana Toraja website toraja.go.id, retrieved on 2007-05-18. The cosmos, according to aluk, is divided into the upper world (heaven), the world of man (earth), and the underworld.cf. Kis-Jovak et al. (1988), Ch. 2, Hetty Nooy-Palm, The World of Toraja, pp. 12‚Äì18. At first, heaven and earth were married, then there was a darkness, a separation, and finally the light. Animals live in the underworld, which is represented by rectangular space enclosed by pillars, the earth is for mankind, and the heaven world is located above, covered with a saddle- shaped roof. Other Toraja gods include Pong Banggai di Rante (god of Earth), Indo' Ongon-Ongon (a goddess who can cause earthquakes), Pong Lalondong (god of death), and Indo' Belo Tumbang (goddess of medicine); there are many more. Asmat The mythology of Fumeripits explain the origin of Asmat people, on the Southern coast of Papua. The myth explains that Fumeripits was the first man in Asmat lands. Fumeripits' canoe sank in the sea and his body was stranded on Asmat coast. He was revived by magical bird. Feeling lonely he carved numerous wooden figures, and when he created tifa drum and played it, these wooden figures magically became alive as the ancestors of Asmat people. Sunda According to Sunda Wiwitan beliefs of the Sundanese, a supreme god named Sang Hyang Kersa created the universe and also other gods such as Mother Goddess Batari Sunan Ambu and Batara Guru (identified as Shiva after the adoption of Hinduism). Many other gods were adopted from Hindu gods such as Indra and Vishnu. Batara Guru rules the kahyangan or svargaloka as the king of gods, while the Sang Hyang Kersa remains unseen. According to Sundanese legends, the land of Parahyangan highlands was magically created when the hyangs (gods) are happy and smiling. To fill the land Sang Hyang Kersa created animals and demons, while the myth of Dewi Sri explains the origin of rice and plants on earth as told in Wawacan Sulanjana. Sang Hyang Kersa also created seven bataras (lesser demigods) in Sasaka Pusaka Buana (The Sacred Place on Earth). The oldest of these is Batara Cikal who is considered the ancestor of the Kanekes people. Other bataras ruled various locations in Sunda lands and became the ancestors of human beings. Sundanese folklore also explains the origin of certain things and places. The myth of Sangkuriang explains the origin of Tangkuban Perahu volcano, and the collective memory of an ancient lake in Bandung. The epic tale of Ciung Wanara explains the relationship between Sundanese and Javanese people as the tale of two contesting brothers. Java The Javanese myth of Tantu Pagelaran explains the origin of Java island. Batara Guru (Shiva) ordered the gods Brahma and Vishnu to fill Java island with human beings. However at that time Java island was floating freely on the ocean. To make the island stay still, the gods decided to nail it on the earth by moving part of Mahameru in Jambudvipa (India) and attaching it upon Java. Vishnu transformed into a giant turtle and carried the Meru upon his back, while the god Brahma transformed into a giant naga serpent and wrapped his body around the mountain and giant turtle's back, so the Meru mountain could be transported safely. The mountain fragments scattered upon Java created the volcanoes and mountainous regions spanned from west to east. The main part of the Meru mountain attached to the eastern part of Java. Later the gods cut off a small tip to make Mount Pawitra (Mount Penanggungan,) while the main part of Meru mountain became Semeru volcano, the abode of Lord Shiva. The myth of Aji Saka tells the story about the coming of civilization to Java, brought by the legendary first king of Java Aji Saka, and the story of Javanese script. Soon after the gods created and nailed the island of Java, the island became habitable. However the first race to rule the island were the denawa (giant demon) that repressed all creatures and ate humans. The first kingdom in Java was Medang Kamulan, and the king was the Giant King Dewata Cengkar, the cruel King of the country who ate the flesh of his own people. One day a young wise man by the name of Aji Saka come to fight Dewata Cengkar. Aji Saka came from Bumi Majeti. Some sources hold that his origin was Jambudwipa (India) from Shaka (Schytian) origin, explaining his name. One day he told his two servants Dora and Sembodo that he was going to Java. He told them that while he was away, both of them were to guard his heirloom (Pusoko). After arriving in Java, Aji Saka moved inland to the kingdom of Medang Kamulan. In a battle, Aji Saka pushed Dewata Cengkar into the South Sea. Dewata Cengkar did not die, instead becoming a Bajul Putih (White Crocodile). Aji Saka became a ruler of Medang Kamulan. Meanwhile, a woman of the village of Dadapan, found an egg. She put the egg in her Lumbung (Rice Barn). After a certain period the egg vanished, replaced by a snake. The villagers wanted to kill the snake, but the snake said, \\"I'm the son of Aji Saka, bring me to him\\". Aji Saka told the snake that he would be recognized as his son, if he could kill the Bajul Putih in the South Sea. After a long, stormy battle in which both sides demonstrated strength and skill, the snake killed Bajul Putih. As had been promised the snake was recognized as Aji Saka's son and he was given a name Jaka Linglung (a stupid boy). In the palace Jaka Linglung greedily ate the domestic pets of the palace. He was punished by the King, expelling him to live in the Jungle of Pesanga. He was tightly roped until he could not move his head. He was instructed only to eat things which fall into his mouth. One day, a group of nine village boys were playing around in that Jungle. Suddenly it was raining heavily. They found shelter in a cave. Only eight boys went inside, while the ninth, suffering from skin disease had to stay out. All of a sudden, the cave fell apart, and the eight boys vanished. Only the one who stayed outside was safe. The cave was actually the mouth of Jaka Linglung. After ruling the Medang Kamulan kingdom, Aji Saka sent a messenger to inform his faithful servants to bring the pusoko to him. Dora came to Sembodo and told him that Aji Saka ask them to bring the pusoko to Java. Sembodo refused, since he clearly remembered Aji Saka's order: no one except Aji Saka himself was allowed to take the pusoko. Dora and Sembodo distrusted each other, and suspected that the other tried to steal the pusoko. They fought to death. Aji Saka became curious why it was taking so long, came home himself only to discover the bodies of his two faithful servants and the terrible misunderstanding between them. Aji Saka composed a poem to them that later become the origin of hanacaraka Javanese script. The Javanese alphabet itself forms a poem, and a perfect pangram, of which the line-by-line translation is as follows.:Soemarmo, Marmo. \\"Javanese Script.\\" Ohio Working Papers in Linguistics and Language Teaching 14.Winter (1995): 69-103.

Minangkabau  Minangkabau culture is heavily influenced by Islamic faith. As a result, Islamic mythology can be found in Minangkabau culture. However Minangkabau people have their own legend about the origin of their tribe's name. The name Minangkabau is thought to be a portmanteau of minang (\\"victorious\\") and kabau (\\"buffalo\\"). A legend holds that the name is derived from a territorial dispute between the Minangkabau and a neighbouring prince, traditionally associated with Java. To avoid a battle, the local people proposed a fight to the death between two water buffalo. The prince agreed and produced the largest, meanest, most aggressive buffalo. The Minangkabau produced a hungry baby buffalo with small horns ground to be as sharp as knives. Seeing the adult buffalo across the field, the baby ran forward, hoping for milk. The big buffalo saw no threat in the baby buffalo and paid no attention to it, looking around for a worthy opponent. When the baby thrust his head under the big bull's belly, looking for an udder, the sharpened horns killed the bull and the Minangkabau won the dispute. Minangkabau royalties can be traced to Matriarch Bundo Kanduang.  Malay  Malay also heavily influenced by Islamic culture. As a result, Islamic mythology shaped the myth among Malay people. The Malay Annals (Sulalatus Salatin) describe some of these myths and often mention Islamic and Middle East references. According to Malay legends the ancestor of Malay king was Sang Sapurba a demigod descendant of Iskandar Dzulkarnain, a Middle Eastern legendary-historical figure usually associated with Alexander the Great. It was said that Sang Sapurba descended on the top of Bukit Seguntang in Palembang and became the predecessor of Malay kings in the region. ==Deities== The myth connected to the story of god and goddesses and mythical or legendary creatures ==Demons== Demons are malevolent beings and evil spirits. Some of these demons are derived from older traditions, while other might derived from recent urban legends. ==References *Tulisan dari ‚ÄòMaluku‚Äô Kategori *Folk Orientation in Halmahera * mythology Category:Religion in Indonesia Category:Indonesian mythology ","title":"Mythology of Indonesia"},{"id":"35241491","text":"The American Institute of Indian Studies (AIIS), founded in 1961, is a consortium of 87 universities and colleges in the United States that promotes the advancement of knowledge about India in the U.S. It carries out this purpose by: awarding fellowships to scholars and artists to carry out their research and artistic projects in India; by operating intensive programs in a variety of Indian languages in India; by sponsoring conferences, workshops and outreach activities; by supporting U.S. study abroad and service learning programs in India; by assisting and facilitating the research of all U.S. scholars in India; and by operating two research archives, the Archives and Research Center for Ethnomusicology and the Center for Art and Archaeology.

Buffers Alley set the pace with a fine point from Elsie Walsh, but a goal for Killeagh in the fifth minute which was against the run of play put the Cork team into a lead which they never relinquished. Although the Buffers Alley midfield did well, the forwards failed to use their chances. A goal by Killeagh's Betty Joyce in the 10th minute increased the Cork lead and, although Elsie Walsh continued to pick off points for Buffers Alley, the Wexford team remained in arrears and were trailing by five points at the interval. A Bridie Doran goal just after the restart brought Buffers Alley back into contention and a point from Elsie Walsh a minute later narrowed the deficit to a point. Then the Killeagh team, best served by Betty Joyce, Marie O'Donovan and Pat Moloney, kept up the pressure and added a further goal and a point to their score. Terry Butler did well in the Wexford goal.Report of final in Irish Press, November 10, 1980Report of final in Irish Independent, November 10, 1980Report of final in Irish Times, November 10, 1980 Final stages \\\\---- \\\\---- { width=92%  -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=center colspan=\\"4\\"Killeagh (Cork): - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK 1  Patricia Fitzgibbon - FB 2  Marie Costine - RWB 3  Mary Spillane - CB 4  Breda Landers (captain) - LWB 5  Cathy Landers - MF 6  Ann Marie Landers - MF 7  Pat Moloney - MF 8  Barbara Kirby - RWF 9 Betty Joyce - CF 10 Patsy Keniry - LWF 11 Anne Leahy - FF 12 Marion Sweeney - } valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font- size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=center colspan=\\"4\\"Buffers Alley (Wx): - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK 1  Kathleen Tonks - FB 2  Ann Butler - RWB 3  Geraldine Duggan - CB 4  Dorothy Walsh - LWB 5  Deirdre Cousins - MF 6  Fiona Cousins - MF 7  Caroline O'Leary - MF 8  A.

The parish of Our Lady of Dolours with its school, St. Joseph‚Äôs was entrusted to the Salesians in 1948, about the same time as the Salesians settled in Matunga. The school was co-ed until the Salesian Sisters came into the Wadala Village with the Auxilium Convent for girls. The centerpiece of the church is a statue of the Pieta. The parish extends till Kings Circle fly-over in the North, Naigaum, Sahakar Nagar and Kidwai Nagar in the South, Hindu Colony/Ruia College in the West and the Harbour Branch Railway line including the Reynold‚Äôs Road, BPT Quarters in the East. These geographical boundaries were drawn after the parish of St. Dominic Savio, Antop Hill was carved out of Our Lady of Dolours church in 1981. Most parishioners are concentrated in the Wadala Village, Sahakar Nagar, the Catholic Colony and Don Bosco Hsg. Society, Kidwai Nagar, Madhav Nagar, David Barretto Road, Katrak Road and CGS Quarters. Most, especially the original inhabitants of Wadala and Gowari Villages are East Indians. The rest hail mainly from Goa and Mangalore. These were able to come into Wadala largely because of the buildings built by the Salesians for Catholics. the parish priest was Fr.Godfrey D'Sa, SDB, Assistant Parish priest Fr.Vivian D'zouza, SDB, administrator Fr. Sanjay Lopes, SDB. The principal of St.Joseph's High School was Fr.Bernard Fernandes, SDB. ==History== Wadala was once a wilderness with nothing more than a few villages amidst marshy fields and salt pans. In 1853, Fr. J. Braz Fernandes, Vicar of Our Lady of Salvation Church, Dadar, built a small chapel dedicated to Nossa Senhora das Dores (Our Lady of Dolours) to cater to the needs of the Catholics of Wadala, Govari, Naigaum, Matunga, Antop Hill, Dadar, Sewri, Customs and BPT Quarters. In 1936 the chapel was replaced by a church, whose cornerstone was laid on 1 November 1936, and the church was blessed on 17 October 1937 by Msgr. Charles Ghezzi SJ, Administrator Apostolic of the Archdiocese of Bombay. The first mass in the newly built church was offered by him with several priests (including former chaplains) concelebrating. On 12 March 1941, the parish of Our Lady of Dolours, Wadala was carved out from the parish of Our Lady of Salvation, Dadar. The first parish priest of the new church was Fr. Augusto Fernandes. On 22 August 1948, the parish of Our Lady of Dolours with the newly built school was entrusted to the Salesians of Don Bosco who had just established themselves near Kings Circle, a little more than a kilometer away. This was the first parish run by the Salesians in the Archdiocese. Fr. Edward Rego was appointed the first Salesian parish priest and principal of St. Joseph‚Äôs School. He rebuilt St. Joseph‚Äôs School and raised it to the level of a high school in 1955. In 1981 the church of St. Dominic Savio was built in the heart of the Antop Hill slums. It was carved out of the mother parish, Our Lady of Dolours. In 1985 the community of Salesians at Our Lady of Dolours Church was given canonical status and Fr. Olivio Miranda was the first Rector-Parish Priest. The work on the church structure that was in urgent need of repairs started on 27 January 1994 and was completed in 1996. The relic of Don Bosco was displayed at Our Lady of Dolours Church on 13 August 2011. The relic was taken on a worldwide pilgrimage as part of the preparation for his bicentenary celebrations. ==Priests belonging the parish and school.== * Fr.

Both therefore missed out on the two automatic places for promotion to the Premier League and instead took part in the play-offs to determine the third promoted team. West Ham finished two points behind Southampton (who were promoted in second place) and three behind league winners Reading. Blackpool ended the season eleven points behind West Ham. Blackpool faced Birmingham City in their play-off semi-finals, with the first leg being played at Bloomfield Road. A long-range shot from Tom Ince ricocheted off Birmingham defender Curtis Davies past Colin Doyle late in the first half. The match finished 1-0, securing Blackpool's tenth consecutive play-off victory. In the return leg, played five days later at St Andrew's, Stephen Dobbie extended Blackpool's aggregate lead on the stroke of half time. Matt Phillips scored soon after the break to make it 3-0 on aggregate to Blackpool before Birmingham's Nikola ≈Ωigiƒá scored midway through the second half.

A first-half brace from Jack Collison ensured the London club took a 2-0 lead to the return leg at the Boleyn Ground. Goals from West Ham captain Kevin Nolan, Ricardo Vaz T√™ and Nicky Maynard secured a 3-0 victory and an aggregate 5-0 win, and qualified the club for their first appearance at Wembley since the 1981 Football League Cup Final.

West Ham also had play-off final experience having lost the 2004 Football League First Division play-off Final against Crystal Palace but winning the following season's play-off final against Preston North End. During the regular season, West Ham dominated Blackpool, winning 4-0 at the Boleyn Ground in October 2011, and 4-1 at Bloomfield Road the following February. West Ham's Vaz T√™ was the division's top scorer, with 22 goals to his name, including 10 while he was at Barnsley earlier in the season. Blackpool's top scorer was Kevin Phillips who netted 16 times during the regular season. The referee for the final was Howard Webb, with assistant referees Peter Kirkup and Mike Mullarkey, and Kevin Friend acted as the fourth official. Blackpool went into the final without Gary Taylor-Fletcher whose injury during training prevented him from taking part. During Blackpool's regular season, he had contributed ten assists and eight goals; Phillips started in his place, and Czech striker Roman Bedn√°≈ô was named amongst the substitutes. West Ham's Collinson was cleared to play, despite suffering a dislocated shoulder in the play-off semi-finals. First half West Ham United kicked the game off around 3p.m. in front of a Wembley crowd of 78,523. Almost immediately, the first chance fell to West Ham's Carlton Cole but Nolan's pass was too long and was picked up by the Blackpool goalkeeper Matt Gilks. At the other end, a mistake from Matthew Taylor allowed Dobbie to shoot but it was blocked by Green onto the post. Another chance for Blackpool came in the 14th minute: Matt Phillips was played in by Dobbie but he shot straight at Green who saved once again. Four minutes later, Vaz T√™'s shot hits the side netting after a pass from Mark Noble. Collison‚Äôs shot then sailed high and wide of Blackpool's goal. On the half-hour mark, a series of four consecutive corners for West Ham came to nothing, but in the 34th minute the deadlock was broken. Taylor made a cross-field pass to Cole who took one touch to control the ball before shooting past Gilks to make the score 1-0\\\\. Another shot went wide from Vaz T√™ three minutes later, and after one minute of stoppage time, the half was brought to an end with West Ham leading by the single goal. Second half Two minutes into the second half, Ince scored the equaliser for Blackpool. Cole lost the ball near the half-way line and a Matt Phillips pass over Winston Reid fell to Ince whose first-time strike beat Green in the West Ham goal. Kevin Phillips then played Alex Baptiste in and his lob over Green was cleared off the line by Taylor. In the 54th minute, West Ham made the first substitution of the afternoon, with George McCartney coming on to replace Gary O'Neil. Shortly after, Guy Demel was injured and was replaced by Julien Faubert. Taylor's cross was then headed high over the Blackpool bar by Collison. Vaz T√™'s weak attempt was then cleared by Taylor before Gilks was forced to save a shot on the turn from Cole. In the 66th minutes, Dobbie's shot from the centre of the penalty area went wide, before Noble made a goal-line clearance to Baptiste, who struck the ball over the bar. Blackpool made their first substitution on 71 minutes, with Ludovic Sylvestre coming on to replace Kevin Phillips, and began to dominate possession. Green saved another Dobbie shot before West Ham's Nolan's volley struck the bar after Gilks' fingertip save. With three minutes to go Nolan passed to Cole who rode a challenge and collided with Gilks. Vaz T√™ picked up the loose ball and hit it into the roof of the Blackpool goal, making it 2-1 to the London club. In the final minute of regular time, Dobbie and √Ångel Mart√≠nez were replaced by Nouha Dicko and Bedn√°≈ô. Four minutes of injury time followed but with no change to the score, and West Ham were promoted back to the Premier League, one season after they were relegated.

Publisher, founder of the first Russian private museum of political history, the Museum of Diplomatic Corps in Vologda, Russia; he is the author of multiple articles, books, and popular science publications. ==Biography== Alexander Bykov was born in Vologda, on 10 August 1962. In 1984, he graduated from the Vologda State Pedagogical Institute, Department of History. After graduation, he worked in a secondary school for a short time, then served in the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. He completed his military service, and started his career as a public museums coordinator- consultant at the Vologda Museum of Local Lore, History and Economy. While occupying the position he went on a number of work trips throughout the Vologda Oblast which resulted in creating and reconstructing five museums in the districts of the region.Archive of the Museum of Diplomatic Corps In 1989, Alexander Bykov was invited by the Vologda regional administration to work as a leading specialist in historical-cultural heritage of the Department of Culture. His efforts prevented putting many memorials of historical-cultural heritage under the Russian Orthodox Church‚Äôs supervision without making sure that they were taken good care of and renovated. Besides, Bykov was opposed to transferring the icon of the 15th century ‚ÄúZyrianskaya Troitsa‚Äù (icon of the Holy Trinity) to the Republic of Komi. The fact that the Russia Federation President‚Äôs representative in the Vologda Oblast insisted on the handover did not influence his viewpoint. Bykov was supported by other cultural figures of the Vologda region. As a result, with the united efforts the icon was left in the collection of the Vologda reserve museum. In 1992, Bykov left civil service, started in private business but continued his research. In 1994, Bykov defended his Ph.D. thesis, and in 1997 organized the Museum of Diplomatic Corps, the first Russian private museum of political history.–≠–π–¥–µ–ª—å–º–∞–Ω –¢. ¬´–ò –±—ã—Å—Ç—Ä—ã—Ö —Ä–∞–∑—É–º–æ–º –ù–µ–≤—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–≤‚Ä¶¬ª // –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª, 19 —Å–µ–Ω—Ç—è–±—Ä—è 2000 From 2002 to 2009, Bykov published a historical-local lore magazine \\"Piatnitskiy Boulevard\\". At the same time he organized exhibitions on the history of Vologda and Vologda region, and exhibitions on Russian folk costumes history, old post cards, business cards, etc. Books, articles, and collected stories written or edited by Bykov, are well known in Russia among museum specialists and history-fanciers. ==Scientific works== A.Bykov‚Äôs first article was published on 21 February 1981, in a Vologda local paper \\"Krasniy Sever\\" (Red North). The work was devoted to the big treasure of copper coins used in the era of Ekaterina II which had been found shortly before that on the outskirts of Vologda. The article discussing the currency of the 18th century, revealed secrets of the peasants‚Äô treasure, and analyzed the items of the discovery. The publication attracted attention. As a reaction, a TV story about the treasure was shot and shown in a serialized television program in many Soviet Union regions.–ö–∞–º–µ–Ω—Ü–µ–≤–∞ –ï. –ò. –ú–∞–ª–µ–Ω—å–∫–∏–π —é–±–∏–ª–µ–π // –ú–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π –Ω—É–º–∏–∑–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∞–ª—å–º–∞–Ω–∞—Ö ¬´–ú–æ–Ω–µ—Ç–∞¬ª. ‚Äî –í–æ–ª–æ–≥–¥–∞: –ú–î–ö, 2001. ‚Äî –í—ã–ø. 8. ‚Äî –°. 6-11. Simultaneously, Bykov studied treasures of the 16th-18th centuries in the regional and district museums. His articles came out in collected stories of the State Historical Museum in Moscow and district scientific digests. In the second half of the 1980s, in the ‚ÄúMemorials of numismatics in the Vologda regional museums‚Äù series, the following catalogues came out: ‚ÄúTreasures of the Time of Troubles‚Äù, and ‚ÄúTreasures of the 1830-1840s‚Äù. At about the same time he published a popular scientific brochure called ‚ÄúA folk costume of Kadnikov district of the Vologda Governorate‚Äù.–ë—ã–∫–æ–≤ –ê. –í. –ö–ª–∞–¥—ã 30-40 –≥–≥.

Since 1982 Bykov has been a permanent participant of numismatic conferences where he always gives a report. In 1993, he organized and held the first All-Russian numismatic conference in Vologda which moved the domestic numismatics field and special historical disciplines to a new stage of development. The event started a tradition of annual All- Russian numismatic conferences, and also contributed to the union of specialists from most cities of Russia, Commonwealth of Independent States‚Äô republics, and other countries. In 1994-1995, under the aegis of the conference, a series (9 editions) of an International numismatic literary miscellany \\"Moneta\\" (Coin) came out, edited and financially supported by Bykov. Moneta was considered to be the most significant Russian scientific publication on numismatics, and the only periodical scientific publication on numismatics in Russia at that period. In the same year Bykov defended his Ph.D. thesis at the chair of auxiliary historical disciplines of the Russian State University for the Humanities. The subject of the thesis was ‚ÄúPeculiarities of currency circulation in European North of Russia in the first half of the 17th century‚Äù.–ë—ã–∫–æ–≤ –ê. –í. –î–µ–Ω–µ–∂–Ω–æ–µ –æ–±—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –°–µ–≤–µ—Ä–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –≤ –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–π –ø–æ–ª–æ–≤–∏–Ω–µ XVII –≤.: –ê–≤—Ç–æ—Ä–µ—Ñ–µ—Ä–∞—Ç –¥–∏—Å—Å–µ—Ä—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –Ω–∞ —Å–æ–∏—Å–∫–∞–Ω–∏–µ —É—á–µ–Ω–æ–π —Å—Ç–µ–ø–µ–Ω–∏ –∫–∞–Ω–¥–∏–¥–∞—Ç–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –Ω–∞—É–∫. ‚Äî –ú.: –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –≥—É–º–∞–Ω–∏—Ç–∞—Ä–Ω—ã–π —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç, 1994. ‚Äî 20 —Å. In 1996, Bykov started working on a new historical project. He gathered materials about the stay of the Entente diplomatic corps in Vologda in 1918. Bykov worked in special archives in Russia, in the U.S.A, and France. In 1998, his first big work on this subject, a book ‚Äúthe Diplomatic capital of Russia‚Äù was published.–ë—ã–∫–æ–≤ –ê. –í., –ü–∞–Ω–æ–≤ –õ. –°. –î–∏–ø–ª–æ–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Å—Ç–æ–ª–∏—Ü–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏. ‚Äî –í–æ–ª–æ–≥–¥–∞: –ê—Ä–¥–≤–∏—Å—É—Ä–∞, 1998. ‚Äî 198 —Å. At the same time he organized and held an international conference ‚ÄúRussia and the World community in the early 20th century: Theory and practice of mutual relations‚Äù inside the walls of the ‚ÄúMuseum of Diplomatic Corps‚Äù. In 1999, Bykov worked on a new monograph on the fate of the grand dukes Romanov, exiled in 1918 in Vologda and shot to death without legitimate criminal investigations and court decisions.–ë—ã–∫–æ–≤ –ê. –í. –ü—É—Ç—å –Ω–∞ –ì–æ–ª–≥–æ—Ñ—É. –•—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –≥–∏–±–µ–ª–∏ –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏—Ö –∫–Ω—è–∑–µ–π –†–æ–º–∞–Ω–æ–≤—ã—Ö. ‚Äî –í–æ–ª–æ–≥–¥–∞: –ú–î–ö, 2000. ‚Äî 192 —Å. The book, based on unknown archival data, gives a detailed story of the last months, of the grand dukes Romanov, Pavel Alexandrovich, Nikolay Constantinovich, and Georgiy Mikhailovich. The name of the latter is well known to the specialists in Russian numismatics history. In January 2009, Bykov published a book entitled ‚ÄúAnd Tanya‚Äôs golden name‚Äù, where he narrated about a famous Russian poet Nikolay Rubtsov‚Äôs first love for Tatiana Reshetova (Agafonova, maiden name). The poet had devoted more that 20 poems to Reshetova, including the famous ‚ÄúBouquet.‚Äù The author managed to get unique information and materials about Rubtsov from Reshetova. He was interested in the materials which had been used for the plot of the poems. Before Bykov nobody had made such a detailed research on the first love of the poet. In the book itself the author described the meeting of Reshetova and Rubtsov, their dates, letters, separation and the love that the poet cherished for many years, depicting his love in his poetry.–ë—ã–∫–æ–≤ –ê. –í. –ò –∑–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ–µ –∏–º—è –¢–∞–Ω—è‚Ä¶ –ü–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç—å –æ –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–π –ª—é–±–≤–∏ –ø–æ—ç—Ç–∞ –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞—è –†—É–±—Ü–æ–≤–∞. ‚Äî –í–æ–ª–æ–≥–¥–∞, 2009 ==List of works==  Books and monographs  # –ë—ã–∫–æ–≤ –ê. –í. –ö–ª–∞–¥—ã –°–º—É—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏ 1605‚Äî1619 –≥–≥. –ö–∞—Ç–∞–ª–æ–≥ // –ü–∞–º—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –Ω—É–º–∏–∑–º–∞—Ç–∏–∫–∏ –≤ –º—É–∑–µ—è—Ö –í–æ–ª–æ–≥–æ–¥—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏. ‚Äî –í–æ–ª–æ–≥–¥–∞,–ú–î–ö, 1989. ‚Äî –ß. 1. ‚Äî 64 —Å. # –ë—ã–∫–æ–≤ –ê. –í. –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ—Å—Ç—é–º –í–æ–ª–æ–≥–æ–¥—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏. –ö–æ—Å—Ç—é–º –ö–∞–¥–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —É–µ–∑–¥–∞ –í–æ–ª–æ–≥–æ–¥—Å–∫–æ–π –≥—É–±–µ—Ä–Ω–∏–∏ XIX-–Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∞ XX –≤. ‚Äî –í–æ–ª–æ–≥–¥–∞: –ì–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞, 1990. ‚Äî 48 —Å.

The match was played on 26 May 2012 at Wembley Stadium to decide the third team to be promoted from League One to the Championship for the 2012‚Äì13 season. Under League One play-off rules, the final is contested by the two teams which secured an aggregate victory over the two-legged semi-finals contested between the teams finishing between third and sixth in the league table. The match itself ended in a 0‚Äì0 draw after extra time, with Huddersfield Town going on to win 8‚Äì7 on penalties. ==Background== This match was Huddersfield Town's fourth play-off final, their previous three coming in 1995 (a 2‚Äì1 win over Bristol Rovers), 2004 (a 4‚Äì1 penalty shoot-out win over Mansfield Town) and 2011 (a 3‚Äì0 loss to Peterborough United), and completed their eighth Football League play-off campaign. It was their first ever visit to the renovated Wembley Stadium. Manager Simon Grayson had previously achieved promotion success as a manager from the Football League One play-offs with Blackpool in the 2007 final. Sheffield United had been involved in six previous play-off campaigns in the modern era, but have never won a play-off final despite attempts in 1997, 2003 and 2009. The previous encounters between the two teams in the 2011‚Äì12 Football League One season ended in an away victory in both matches, Huddersfield taking a 3‚Äì0 victory away at Bramall Lane with goals from Oscar Gobern and a brace from Lee Novak, and Sheffield United winning 1‚Äì0 away at the Kirklees Stadium thanks to a Neill Collins goal. ==Route to the final== The two-legged semi-finals determined the competitors in the final. First legs \\\\---- Second legs Sheffield United won 1‚Äì0 on aggregate. \\\\---- Huddersfield Town won 3‚Äì2 on aggregate. ==Pre-match== Huddersfield's biggest injury doubt was that of goalkeeper Ian Bennett, who injured his hand during the semi-final second leg against Milton Keynes Dons, with Alex Smithies on standby as his replacement. Scott Arfield had recovered from the ankle injury that forced him off in the semi-final first leg and later forced him to miss the home tie. Sheffield United's Kevin McDonald picked up a hamstring injury in their 1‚Äì0 win in the semi-final second leg, and missed the final. Richard Cresswell had recovered from an eye infection that caused him to miss the previous match, and looked set to feature in the final. ==Match== Summary The match was a cagey affair, with Huddersfield creating the most chances. In the first minute of the second half, Town winger Danny Ward hit the angle of the crossbar with a right-footed shot. Later, Harry Maguire headed wide from Stephen Quinn's corner, before Town captain Peter Clarke responded, heading Kallum Higginbotham's corner wide. Blades keeper Steve Simonsen made vital contributions to the team, saving two further headers from Clarke, while Michael Doyle cleared Tommy Miller's follow-up effort off the line to preserve the clean sheet. In extra time, Clarke came to Huddersfield's rescue in his own penalty area, blocking Stephen Quinn's drive in the 98th minute. Town substitute Alan Lee then failed to score with an angled shot, Simonsen saving in the 109th minute to see the tie through to penalties. The penalties were taken at the west end of the stadium, in front of the Huddersfield Town fans. Huddersfield were the first team to walk up to the spot, but missed their first three penalties. However, the score was 2‚Äì2 after the first five penalties, taking the shoot-out to sudden death. Each team scored their next five penalties, leaving goalkeeper Alex Smithies to be the last of the 11 Huddersfield players to take a penalty. He scored. Sheffield United's last penalty also fell to their goalkeeper Steve Simonsen. Simonsen fired his spot-kick over the bar, securing an 8‚Äì7 penalty shoot-out victory for Huddersfield Town in a contest that had all 22 players on the field taking a penalty.

It took over Bahrain's assets of Gulf Oil. In 1930 it obtained the only oil concession in Bahrain. BAPCO discovered first oil in 1931. On 31 May 1932, the company discovered the Bahrain Field (Awali Field). After exporting oil and constructing a refinery, it started with refining capacity in 1936. Later that year the Standard Oil Company of California signed an agreement with Texaco, which acquired a half of BAPCO's shares. In 1975 more than 60% BAPCO's shares was acquired by the Government of Bahrain. In 1980, all BAPCO's shares were taken over by the Government of Bahrain. In 1978 the oil sector was nationalized and BAPCO assumed full control of the national energy sector. In 1999, the current Bahrain Petroleum Company was created when the Bahrain National Oil Company, established in 1976, merged with BAPCO. In 2018 BAPCO commissioned a new pipeline that replaced the over 70 years old pipeline infrastructure between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. In March 2019 construction work was started to upgrade the main oil refinery Sitra. The $5 billion project will increase the capacity to . On 29 December 2019, the company was allegedly targeted by Iranian hackers with data-wiping malware called Dustman, with only a small portion of the company's computers being affected. Currently Peter Bartlett serves as CEO of the BAPCO. BAPCO started their lubricants business unit in 2011 and launched its lubricants in 2015 in the local markets of Bahrain. ==Operations== BAPCO is an integrated oil company operating in the field of exploration, drilling, production, refining, and marketing. It operates a oil refinery which lies midway between the original BAPCO expat workers accommodation township of Awali and Sitra. The complex also includes storage facilities for , a marketing terminal, and a marine terminal. 95% of the company's products are for exports. About one-sixth of this crude originates from the Bahrain Field, with the remainder being pumped from Saudi Arabia. Saudi Aramco supplies approximately through the pipeline from Aramco's Abqaiq Plant. Bapco started their lubricants business unit in 2011 and launched its lubricants in 2015 in the local markets of Bahrain. Unit was headed by Howard Hancock and supported by Bhupinder Singh as Head Sales and Marketing, ==References * Category:National oil and gas companies Category:Non-renewable resource companies established in 1929 Category:Oil companies of Bahrain Category:Energy companies established in 1929 Category:Standard Oil ","title":"Bahrain Petroleum Company"},{"id":"35241757","text":"The 2012 Football League Two play-off Final was a football match contested by Cheltenham Town and Crewe Alexandra on 27 May 2012 at Wembley Stadium to decide the fourth team to be promoted from the League Two to the League One for the 2012‚Äì13 season.Football League Key Dates Under League Two play-off rules, the final is contested by the two teams which secured an aggregate victory over the two-legged semi-finals contested between the teams finishing between third and seventh in the league table. ==Match== Details { width=85% -   } { style=\\"width:100%;\\" -  style=\\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - colspan=\\"4\\"Cheltenham Town: - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1Scott Brown - DF 22Sido Jombati - DF 15Alan Bennett - DF 6Steve Elliott - DF 19Luke Garbutt - MF 20Jermaine McGlashan - MF 7Marlon Pack   - MF 25Luke Summerfield - MF 23Kaid Mohamed - FW 10Jeff Goulding   - FW 29Ben Burgess   - colspan=4Substitutes: - DF 2Keith Lowe - MF 11Brian Smikle - MF 16Russell Penn   - FW 9Darryl Duffy   - FW 14Jimmy Spencer   - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\"Mark Yates } valign=\\"top\\"  style=\\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\\" { cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"font-size:90%; margin:auto;\\" - colspan=\\"4\\"Crewe Alexandra: - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1Steve Phillips - DF 3Harry Davis - DF 5David Artell - DF 6Adam Dugdale - DF 17Kelvin Mellor - MF 11Byron Moore   - MF 4Ashley Westwood - MF 8Luke Murphy - MF 2Matt Tootle - FW 10A-Jay Leitch- Smith   - FW 25Nick Powell   - colspan=4Substitutes: - GK 13Alan Martin - DF 15Carl Martin   - MF 7Lee Bell   - FW 19Max Clayton   - FW 34Billy Bodin - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\"Steve Davis } } { width=100% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\"  Assistant referees: Steve Bratt John Brooks Fourth official: Nigel Miller Reserve Assistant Referee: David Rock  width=60% valign=top Match rules *90 minutes. *30 minutes of extra time if necessary. *Penalty shoot-out if scores still level. *Five named substitutes. *Maximum of three substitutions. } Statistics { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center\\" - !scope=col width=100  !scope=col width=70  Cheltenham Town !scope=col width=70  Crewe Alexandra - !scope=rowGoals  0  2 - !scope=rowDisallowed goals  1  0 - !scope=rowTotal shots  20  16 - !scope=rowShots on target  5  5 - !scope=rowBall possession  47%  53% - !scope=rowCorner kicks  8  6 - !scope=rowFouls committed  11  8 - !scope=rowOffsides  7  4 - !scope=rowYellow cards  0  0 - !scope=rowRed cards  0  0 } Source: BBC Sport ==Previous play-off appearances== *Crewe: 1992, 1993, 1997 *Cheltenham: 2002, 2006 (won both) ==References== Category:EFL League Two play-off finals 1 Category:Cheltenham Town F.C. matches Category:Crewe Alexandra F.C. matches play-off Final ","title":"2012 Football League Two play-off Final"},{"id":"35241783","text":"Hawise or Hadewis (lived early 12th century), whose origin and parentage are unknown, was the wife of William fitzBaderon, who held Monmouth, Wales and lived in Monmouth Castle from the year 1082 on the orders of King William I of England.

The Mate Literature Society (MLS), Manipurhad, published a primer in Mate in 1960 and 2001. Geographical origins The Mate people originated in China in the land between the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. According to tradition, the Mate people migrated from China and first settled at Tualyang in ancient Burma. From there they established several villages: Tualmun, Thuhial, Theilam, Hailam, Vongmol, Theimol, Kolkaimol, Antaangkhuo, Khuochi, and Chonpeo, and finally settled down at Zoyang village situated in the Chin Hills, Myanmar. The Mate people flourished there for many centuries. Oral history tells of the prosperous life of Mates in Chin, Hills, Burma (now Myanmar) hills. In the later part of their settlement in Chin hills, with the growth of their population, the Mates scattered and founded a new settlement at various places of India and Burma .Pu. Sutthang Mate was the first chief of Thangkhal village. Several decades later, the settlement of Mates in Zoyang, Chin Hills was destroyed by the Pois and her allies. After the destruction of some of the Mate settlement, the remaining Mates found refuge in Thangkhal village and then, from their group by group they migrated into Tengnoupal Village and other Hill areas of Manipur state, and later a few Mates migrated to Assam Hills, Naga Hills and Mizoram. ==Religion== The Mate people practiced a form of animism until the arrival of Christianity, which they universally adopted. Mates are found in all denominations, including Roman Catholic, Kuki Christian Church, Evangelical Congregational Church, Kuki Baptist Convention, [Biblical Baptist Church], Fellowship of Bible Church of India (FBCI) and recently formed their own Christian denomination, The Mate Christian Fellowship Church (MCFC), Manipur, India registered with the Government of Manipur and Government of India, Ministry of Finance under section 12A and 80 G of the IT Act, 1961.

After his transfer to Maribor Joc Peƒçeƒçnik, owner of Interblock, accused Zlatko Zahoviƒç, director of football at the Styrian club, of going behind his back and stealing from them one of the biggest Slovenian talents of his age. At first Stojanoviƒá played as a goalkeeper but he then switched to the position of an offensive midfielder. When he transferred to Maribor youth selections he was regarded as one of the most promising young midfielders in the country, however, Maribor's coaches and staff saw a much bigger potential for Stojanoviƒá on the position of right back. During his first year in Maribor he mostly played for the U17 team. However, due to the league dominance of the club which plays their matches at the Ljudski vrt stadium, he got his chance to play for the main squad in the second part of the 2011‚Äì12 season and made his first appearance in the Slovenian top division, 1. SNL, on 25 March 2012. At the time of his debut, he was 16 years, five months and 18 days of age and set a new club record as the youngest player to appear in the top division. He surpassed the previous record, held by Luka Krajnc and set one season earlier, by exactly two months and 23 days. On 5 January 2016, he signed a five-year contract with Dinamo Zagreb, reportedly for a transfer fee of around ‚Ç¨2 million plus add-ons. ==International career== Stojanoviƒá was a member of the Slovenia national under-17 football team and appeared with the squad at the 2012 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship, where he scored one goal. He made his senior national team debut versus Colombia on 18 November 2014.

It was built in 1752 to 1754 in the style of the late Baroque and Rococo. ==History== In 1752, part of the tower of the old Schierstein church collapsed. Building plans for a new church had already been discussed in previous years and suddenly became urgent. Since 1748, the former Mayor of Frankfurt, merchant and banker Johann Georg Schweitzer Edler von Wiederhold, a member of the Frauenstein Gesellschaft, had allowed the Schierstein curate a collection of 604 guilders in the Free imperial city, which provided the financial basis for the construction of the church. The Chamberlain of Electoral Mainz, privy counsellor and chief architect of Electoral Mainz Anselm Franz von Ritter zu Groenesteyn made the vegetable garden of his country estate available as building terrain. Johann Scheffer, a government official of the duchy of Nassau was responsible for the architectural style of the building. On 3 May 1752 the ground breaking ceremony took place and on 15 September 1754 the new church was consecrated. In 1962 the choir Schiersteiner Kantorei was founded in the parish by cantor Johannes Kr√ºger. Since 1974, the choir has been directed by Martin Lutz, who shaped the group of some 40 singers to a large concert choir. ==Architecture== Exterior The exterior of the church anticipates the upcoming neoclassical architecture, emphasizing the planar qualities of the walls. The one-nave hall type church was constructed in an east‚Äìwest direction with the choir in the east wing as an aisleless church. The exterior dimensions (length , width ) correspond to the golden ratio. The excellent acoustics of the interior may be attributed to it. The western tower, a \\"Welsche Haube\\" (Welsch canopy) does not rest on a separate foundation, but was built as a ridge turret. The tower is located to the east, which is unusual. The pole on top carries a sphere, a cross and a weathercock. Interior While the exterior is kept rather simple, the interior expresses the rococo spirit in colours and vitality. The design of the sanctuary is typical for the Protestant view of the equivalence of the altar (sacrament), pulpit (sermon and exegesis) and organ (worship / community involvement). The four Corinthian columns in the sanctuary symbolize the four Gospels. Three putti symbolize the theological virtues, faith (with the cup), hope (the anchor) and - in the center - charity, according to . Charity holds the law, the Ten Commandments. A realistic representation of the crucifixion is surrounded by a golden halo. Twelve Doric columns support the galleries along the nave, representing the Twelve Apostles, the Twelve tribes of Israel and the community of the congregation. All wood carvings originate from the Frankfurt wood sculptor Johann Daniel Schnorr. The pulpit with the Coat of arms of Nassau-Usingen, the emblem of the sovereign Charles, Prince of Nassau-Usingen, is a symbol of absolutism: The subject who looks up to the preacher of the Gospel, should also see that there is a secular lord. The altar cross originates from the contemporary metal sculptor Professor Klump (Wiesbaden), crafted from gold with rock crystal as a symbol of Christ, and twelve rubies for the Apostles and for feeding the multitude. The Paternoster bronze bell was cast in 1430 in Mainz, bearing the inscription \\"Meyster John of the gos Mence mec\\". ==Church music== The church is a concert venue of the choir Schiersteiner Kantorei, founded here in 1962, and of the Rheingau Musik Festival. In 2011, countertenor Andreas Scholl and harpsichordist Tamar Halperin appeared in concert there. ==References== Category:Churches completed in 1754 Category:18th-century Protestant churches Category:Protestant churches in Wiesbaden Category:1754 establishments in the Holy Roman Empire ","title":"Christophoruskirche, Schierstein"},{"id":"35242018","text":"Now Deh-e Lakvan (, also Romanized as Now Deh-e LakvƒÅn, Nowdeh-e LakvƒÅn, Nowdeh LakvƒÅn, and Now Deh-ye LakvƒÅn; also known as N≈´dah and Nudakh) is a village in Dashtabi-ye Sharqi Rural District, Dashtabi District, Buin Zahra County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

She started attending the Baroda College of Art to pursue Bachelor's in Fine Art, Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda where she graduated with First Class honours in 1971. She was awarded a scholarship to research at the Slade School of Art, London University, London in 1981. She first got great recognition in the 1970s for a body of experimental work made from cow dung as she did not have funds for anything else. Her talent was spotted by the politician and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during an art exhibition, who later encouraged her to take sculpting as a profession. She is a great admirer of Auguste Rodin and uses naturalism as her leitmotif. Her interest and association with nature was kindled by her father, a botanist. She taught at Jamia Millia Islamia and Banaras Hindu University for many years starting 1981 and is currently the Head of Department of Fine Arts at Jamia Millia Islamia.

Milis. Containing eight papers by various Dutch and Belgian historians and archaeologists, it is devoted to the study of how various pre- Christian religious beliefs and practices survived and were absorbed into the new, Christian society in Europe during the Middle Ages. It was first published by the Institut Historique Belge de Rome in 1991 under the Dutch title of De Heidense Middeleeuwen and subsequently translated into English by Tanis Guest and published by The Boydell Press in 1998. ==Synopsis== Milis' \\"Introduction\\" Ludo Milis' opening chapter, entitled \\"Introduction: The Pagan Middle Ages - a contradiction in terms?\\", begins by examining the use of \\"medieval\\" as a derogatory term that has been used to refer to things that are \\"old-fashioned, primitive or barbarous.\\" He contrasts this with the view of the Middle Ages as a time when the Christian Church rose to power in Europe, bringing with it an \\"idealised order\\" of morality and obedience to divine authority. Milis then proceeds to discuss the manner in which contemporary Europeans have projected elements of their own time onto the Middle Ages, for instance noting that modern champions of European unity have praised the Medieval Emperor Charlemagne - rather than Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte or Adolf Hitler - as the \\"Father of Europe\\". The rest of the chapter is devoted to discussing whether historians and archaeologists can talk of a \\"Pagan Middle Ages\\", arguing that there was no such thing as a monolithic Christianity in Medieval Europe, but a variety of different religious positions across the continent. In this context, Milis argues, various \\"pagan rites, usages, ideas and ways of presenting things\\" were accepted into Christianity in different parts of Europe. He criticises the assumption of some earlier scholars that Christianity simply swept away the earlier pagan religions as it spread across Europe, highlighting the comparisons that could be made with the religious beliefs of indigenous peoples in Central and South America, or the black population of the Caribbean, all of which show a great deal of syncreticism between Christianity and older, traditional religion.Milis 1998 p. 1-12.

This was Texas State's only season as members of the Western Athletic Conference. Texas State joined the Sun Belt Conference for all sports in 2013‚Äì14. It was the second year of their transition from the FCS to the FBS, so they were not eligible to win the WAC regular season title or participate in a bowl game until 2013. They finished the season 4‚Äì8, 2‚Äì4 in WAC play to finish in fifth place. ==Before the season== Recruiting 29 recruits signed on, committed, or transferred to play for the 2012 Texas State roster. Maroon-Gold Spring Game The Maroon-Gold Spring Game was held March 31, 2012 at 2:00 PM. Unlike other spring games where the first and third team usually combine and face the second and fourth teams, Texas State determined their teams through a Coaches Players Draft held on March 28. The Gold team was chosen by Thaddeus Watkins, Tyler Arndt, Chase Harper, Darryl Morris, and Joplo Bartu while the Maroon team was chosen by Adley Eshraghipour, Shaun Rutherford, Marcus Curry, Brian Lilly, Jason McLean, and Isaiah Battle. These 11 players, along with Jordan Norfleet, are expected to comprise the Texas State Leadership Council for the 2012 season and will serve as captains throughout the season. The Maroon team was coached by Craig Naivar, Dennis Darnell, Jeff Conway, Mike Hudson, Dennis Porterfield, Wesley Condra, Jeff McKinley, and Vincent Ibewnike. The Gold team was coached by Mike Schultz, Brad Franchione, Jason Johnson, Rueben Vaughn, Jason Washington, Kyle Tatum, John Reid, Ron Woodard, and Eddie Veyran. Head coach Dennis Franchione would join the Texas State radio play-by-play team of Brant Freeman and Bill Culhane on KTSW for the game so he could evaluate his players from the press box area. Sources: It was a hard fought battle between the Maroon and Gold teams. The Gold team got out to an early 17-0 lead with 7:30 left in the first half thanks to a 40-yard touchdown pass from Tyler Arndt to Jafus Gaines and a 13-yard touchdown pass from Jack Rhoades to Larry Centers, Junior, but the maroon team wouldn't be discouraged. Duke DeLancellotti completed a 31-yard touchdown pass to Marcus Curry with 17 second left in the first half to get the maroon team back in the game. DeLancellotti would make it that much closer in the third quarter with a 60-yard touchdown pass to Marcus Curry, but the gold team would strike two seconds into the fourth quarter with a Terrance Franks 25-yard touchdown run that the Gold team would never relinquish. Arndt ended the day completing 13 of his 19 passes for 218 yards. He also gained 22 yards on five carries. Rhoades completed both of his passes for 50 yards. The leading receiver for the Gold team was Andy Erickson, who caught five passes for 119 yards. He had the longest reception in the game when he caught a 70-yard throw from Arndt. Gaines also caught three passes for 81 yards and Chandler Coffey caught a 37-yard pass from Rhoades after moving over to the offense this spring. Franks led the rushing attack for the Gold team with 64 yards on 11 carries. Freshman quarterback Jordan Moore was the leading rusher for the Maroon team after gaining 46 yards on 13 carries. Curry also gained 30 yards on five carries and caught three passes for 71 yards. \\\\---- ==RosterScheduleGame summaries== Houston Texas State leads the series 3-1.

It is the most common of the three species of Dipogon found in Britain.http://www.natureconservationimaging.com/Pages/nature_conservation_imaging_woodland_hedgerow_spiders.htm It prefers woodland and hedgerows where dead wood is present to provide breeding sites. ==Biology== In Britain, this wasp flies from June to September. The only recorded prey in Britain is a species of spider Segestria senoculata from the family Segestriidae, but elsewhere, spiders of the genus Clubiona (Clubionidae) have been recorded as prey.http://www.bembix.de/gallery/pompilidae-htm/Dipogon_subintermedius_1.htm The spider is carried to the wasp's nest by its spinnerets, and prey is then malaxated, which may be a process by which the wasp obtains proteins necessary to produce eggs; certainly, wasps of the genus Dipogon do not appear to visit flowers to obtain nectar. The nest is usually constructed in an existing cavity, normally in wood, and old beetle excavations are often used, although cavities in masonry will also be used. The cavity is normally sealed with spider silk, applied using the maxillary bristles which give the generic name to these wasps.

When Baderon died, at some date between 1170 and 1176, Gilbert succeeded him as lord of Monmouth and holder of Monmouth Castle. Gilbert is best known as a patron of literature and it was under Gilbert's patronage that the poet Hue de Rotelande wrote his verse romance Ipomedon, which was among the most popular works in its genre in medieval England. The original text in Anglo-Norman (a variant of Old French spoken and written in Norman England and Wales) was translated at least three times into Middle English under the variant title Ipomadon. Hue de Rotelande afterwards wrote a sequel, Protheselaus, which he dedicated to his patron Gilbert fitzBaderon. Around 1170 Gilbert acted as witness when his sister Rohese of Monmouth and his brother-in-law Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath, made a donation to Monmouth Priory.W. Dugdale; J. Caley, H. Ellis, B.

It is responsible for the preservation of buildings, monuments, structures, objects and sites deemed of historic or cultural importance to the country. The presidency of the institute was held by only two individuals over its first forty years. Rodrigo Melo Franco led SPHAN/IPHAN from 1937 until his retirement in 1967; his successor was the architect Renato Soeiro, who led the institute from 1967 to 1979. IPHAN maintains 1,047 sites, which include historic buildings, city centers, and landscapes. It additional lists a growing number of intangible cultural heritage entities. ==History== Inspetoria de Monumentos Nacionais The federal agency dedicated to the preservation of historic sites Brazil was created in 1933 under the name Inspetoria de Monumentos Nacionais (IMN). It was established as a unit linked to the National Historical Museum (NHM). IMN was established by Federal Decree No. 24,735 of July 14, 1934. Its main purpose was to prevent the export of historic objects from Brazil to the international antiquities trade and the demolition of buildings and monuments as part of the rapid urban reforms in Brazil during the early 20th century. Servi√ßo do Patrim√¥nio Hist√≥rico e Art√≠stico Nacional The Servi√ßo do Patrim√¥nio Hist√≥rico e Art√≠stico Nacional (SPHAN) was established in 1937 and replace to IMN; it was linked to the Ministry of Education and Health. SPHAN was established through Article no. 378 of the \\"Estado Novo\\" Constitution of 1937) by Get√∫lio Vargas, President of the Republic. The establishment of SPHAN was led by Education Minister Gustavo Capanema and a team which included the poet M√°rio de Andrade. The team, together with the lawyer Rodrigo Melo Franco, undertook a project to research and catalog a large number of historic sites across Brazil. Rodrigo Melo Franco would lead the institute from Instituto do Patrim√¥nio Hist√≥rico e Art√≠stico Nacional SPHAN was replaced by the National Historical and Artistic Heritage Institute (IPHAN) in 1970.

A bottleneck is a more general term for a system that has been reduced or slowed due to limited resources or components. The bottleneck occurs in a network when there are too many users attempting to access a specific resource. Internet bottlenecks provide artificial and natural network choke points to inhibit certain sets of users from overloading the entire network by consuming too much bandwidth. Theoretically, this will lead users and content producers through alternative paths to accomplish their goals while limiting the network load at any one time. Alternatively, internet bottlenecks have been seen as a way for ISPs to take advantage of their dominant market-power increasing rates for content providers to push past bottlenecks. The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has created regulations stipulating that artificial bottlenecks are in direct opposition to a free and open Internet. == Technical details == The technical reasons for Internet bottlenecks are largely related to network congestion in which the user experiences a delay in delivering or accessing content. The bottlenecks can occur naturally, during high network use, or artificially created by owners of the network, generally considered to be ISPs, in order to prevent the network from experiencing overload. The network demands of users continues to grow and with it so do the pressures on networks. The way current technologies process information over the network is slow and consumes large amounts of energy. ISPs and engineers argue that these issues with the increased demand on the networks result in some necessary congestion, but the bottlenecks also occur because of the lack of technology to handle such huge data needs using minimal energy. There are attempts being made to increase the speed, amount of data, and reduce power consumption of the networks. For example, optical memory devices could be used in the future to send and receive light signals working much faster and more efficiently than electrical signals.Nozaki, K., Shinya, A., Matsuo, S., Suzaki, Y., Segawa, T., Sato, T., Kawaguchi, Y., et al. (2012). Ultralow-power all-optical RAM based on nanocavities. Nature Photonics. Nature Publishing Group. doi:10.1038/nphoton.2012.2 Some researchers see optical memory as needed to reduce the demands on the network routers in data transmission, while others do not.Bourzac, K. (2012). Optical memory could ease Internet bottlenecks. NATURE. doi:10.1038/nature.2012.10108 The research will continue to explore possibilities for greater network bandwidth and data transfer. As data consumption needs increase, so will the need for better technology that facilitates the transfer and storage of that data. Deep packet inspection (DPI) may also be used to address network congestion through recognition of a specific set of protocols, services, or users. ISPs may then manipulate the bandwidth allocation for those groups by reducing it to maintain the network stability and available bandwidth for the entire network. Network congestion or Internet bottleneck generally occurs and is felt by users in homes and businesses. This is what is known as the last mile of transmission, which is when there is not enough bandwidth available for individual users to access the content they want. Everyone is attempting to use the bandwidth at the same time creating an Internet traffic jam. == Political details == In terms of public policy, Internet bottlenecks and/or network congestion has largely been nested within the network neutrality debate. Network neutrality is the notion that ISPs and content providers need to be regulated in order to maintain fair speeds and access to content for all Internet users. Internet bottlenecks had been perceived as useful facets of network management, but ISPs have throttled specific types of uses of their networks that have little to do with network management and more to do with network neutrality. New regulatory rules were established by the FCC in order to enforce fair network management practices by ISPs. The rules were established on September 23, 2011, and took effect November 20, 2011. This new set of regulations has three primary rules: # \\"Transparency. Fixed and mobile broadband providers must disclose the network management practices, performance characteristics, and terms and conditions of their broadband services; # \\"No blocking. Fixed broadband providers may not block lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices; mobile broadband providers may not block lawful Web sites, or block applications that compete with their voice or video telephony services; and # \\"No unreasonable discrimination. Fixed broadband providers may not unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic.\\" Of these rules, set up by the FCC, only number 2 and number 3 apply to network bottlenecks. Network bottlenecks represent a specific part of that policy discussion in which ISPs are able to create network flows that are slower for competitors possibly leading customers to go to another website that is more easily accessed, which gives the parent or children companies of the ISPs an advantage. Thus, in the FCC's rule number 2 and 3 there are specific requirements that ISPs do not discriminate or restrict services to those companies who offer competing services similar to the ISP's services. Alternatively, ISPs argue that the bottlenecks are necessary to create artificial control points that create a better experience for all users and content providers creating a more fair and balanced network system. Thus, there is a market-based approach to addressing the issue of bottlenecking by allowing the market to choose from other ISPs that are providing better network speeds, which may force the ISPs using Internet bottlenecks to reduce or remove the bottlenecks. The interested parties in this political issue include: # ISPs - whose interest is to maintain profitability while maintaining quality service to a loyal consumer and content provider base. # Advocacy groups - their goal is to regulate the ISPs. Advocacy groups believe the ISPs are misusing a public good that should be equally distributed to all people and organizations. # Content provider - the institution that creates content on the web and distributes that content through networks belonging to ISPs. # Individual consumer - the average person in the United States, who has home access to the Internet, wireless smart phone data use, or any other Internet access.  Pro-regulation  Organizations, such as the U.S. advocacy organization Free Press, argue that Internet bottlenecks are unnecessary and used by ISPs to arbitrarily lead users to alternate websites, which may or may not be companies of the ISPs. Groups like Free Press, Consumer Federation of America, and Consumers Union argue that the ISPs have no reason to remove bottlenecks from the network. The ISPs can charge more money to content providers to push past the Internet bottleneck. However, Free Press argues that ISPs could alleviate bottlenecks for all by increasing available bandwidth.Scott, B., Cooper, M., & Kenney, J. (2006). Why Consumers Demand Internet Freedom Network Neutrality: Fact vs. Fiction (p. 23). Retrieved from http://www.freepress.net/files/nn_fact_v_fiction_final.pdf Advocacy groups are not the only arm of pro-regulation; Google and other companies like Facebook and Wikipedia support regulatory policy that stops ISPs from placing network bottlenecks on content providers and consumers, which would force content providers to pay extra. The network neutrality rules mentioned above address the concerns of pro-regulatory groups, but are seen as somewhat weak with apparent loopholes.  Anti-regulation  Companies that oppose the regulation of Internet bottlenecks include Comcast and AT&T.; They argue that Internet bottlenecks are a part of the network management strategy of which cannot be fully eliminated due to ever increasing data demands. Thus, it may be necessary at some points to throttle or restrict certain users who are consuming too much bandwidth to allow other users to have equal access. These users have their bandwidth restored once the bottleneck has been reduced. Charges were made against Comcast by the FCC originally brought up by Free Press and others, who claimed that Comcast was purposely degrading the network speed for certain uses of the network, most notably the use of P2P file sharing from services like BitTorrent. == Network management == Network management is the administration, operation and maintenance of a network. Network management is one of the primary arguments used by ISPs in support of reducing Internet bottlenecks. Both Comcast and At&t; cite the use of different techniques in reducing bottlenecks, whether that be throttling certain users or reducing speeds for certain websites. While the ISPs argue that bottlenecks can be removed through increased bandwidth availability that can never catch up with ever-increasing bandwidth demand, pro-regulatory groups see bottlenecks as a beneficial form of network slowdown that enables ISPs to charge more money to users and content providers who wish to move past the bottleneck. ISPs have proposed and have implemented in some cases a tiered service plan allowing users and content providers to pay for premium network lines. These tiered service plans are meant to reduce network congestion at certain levels of bandwidth by allowing high level users to purchase and have access to more available bandwidth. Further, the plans charge based on usage. The more data used the higher the bill would be. Tiered service is common practice among wireless providers, but it is expected that wired connections may soon see usage charges as well, which according to David Hyman will decrease the competitiveness of the open market.  The role of government  The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was tasked with designing and maintaining an internationally competitive national broadband system by implementing a National Broadband Plan. This plan has largely succeeded in improving the overall infrastructure and access to broadband internet. As mentioned in the political details section above, the FCC is now responsible for making sure established rules and regulations are followed. The FCC is further tasked with increasing broadband use through a newer initiative called the Connect America Fund. This fund is meant to reduce wasteful spending, while improving the original Universal Service Fund. The new rules became active November 20, 2011. Since then Verizon has filed lawsuits against the FCC claiming the FCC is overstepping the bounds of the commission, but the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives voted in favor of the Net Neutrality regulations.  From the content provider's perspective  Content providers are actors who have specific interest in gaining as much Internet traffic as possible, but they also have other competitors from other content providers. Advocacy groups argue that content providers need regulated fair access, while some content providers support this, others recommend a free-market system as suggested by Free Press. Those who can afford to bypass any Internet bottleneck will then have an advantage in network speeds, but will have to pay for it. Subsequently, in some cases, peering, creating a physical connection between two networks to avoid other network transit services, has been used to bypass Internet bottlenecks by the user and content provider. There is some speculation that if there is no regulation of Internet bottlenecks, both users and content providers will simply create systems like peering to navigate around ISPs effectively neutralizing them. This may also lead to network security risks that would enable. Netflix has accused Comcast of violating the new Net Neutrality rules by not counting Comcast's Xfinity video service against the monthly data allotment of 250gb, but counting the use of Netflix or any other video service monthly data allotment.  From the user's perspective  Users access the Internet through telecommunications devices in which they purchase a type of Internet service to use that device. Individual users are given limited access to the information about their Internet access other than the download and upload speeds. Further, they are not generally told when their use of the network experiences a bottleneck nor are they told about the actual speeds at which their Internet will function. Greater information for the user has been requested in the new FCC rules, but it is not known whether or not ISPs are providing fully accurate information as the data is generally aggregated or \\"cherry-picked\\" for better examples. Center for Democracy and Technology has recommended that users would benefit from the ability to \\"test the actual performance of their broadband services.\\" Wireless broadband users also have limited capacity to file court claims against ISPs. In the case of At&t; Mobility LLC vs. Concepcion Et Ux. (2012), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that there could be no class action lawsuit against At&t.; Thus, Marguerite Rearden of CNet argues that this Supreme Court decision will limit the future power of any individual in trying to fight back against wireless providers because every wireless provider stipulates in their terms of service that class action suits are not allowed. Any type of overuse of the network will result in some sort of throttling of the user's plan in an attempt by the ISP to limit network congestion, with no warning or notification despite having an unlimited plan. ==NotesReferences== Category:Internet architecture Category:Net neutrality ","title":"Internet bottleneck"},{"id":"35242710","text":"The Journal of Sir Walter Scott is a diary which the novelist and poet Walter Scott kept between 1825 and 1832. It records the financial disaster which overtook him at the beginning of 1826, and the efforts he made over the next seven years to pay off his debts by writing bestselling books. Since its first complete publication in 1890 it has attracted high praise, being considered by many critics one of the finest diaries in the language. == Manuscript == The manuscript of the Journal, \\"a handsome lockd volume\\" as Scott called it, is of quarto size and bound in vellum. The handwriting displayed in it, especially after his final series of strokes, is so atrociously difficult that, according to the Journal's most recent editor, a perfectly accurate transcription is quite impossible. The title-page bears this inscription:Anderson (1998) p. 1 The manuscript was kept at Abbotsford after Scott's death, but was bought by the financier J. P. Morgan around 1900, and is now in the Morgan Library in New York. == Composition == In July 1825 Scott acquired a copy of the Diary of Samuel Pepys, which had just been published for the first time, and according to his son-in-law J. G. Lockhart, \\"I never observed him more delighted with any book whatsoever\\".Lockhart (1896) p. 576. Later that year he read a manuscript copy of Byron's 1821 journal and was impressed by Byron's plan of writing a desultory, unsystematic record of his actions, thoughts and memories, which combined the maximum of interest for the reader with the minimum of effort for the writer. Inspired by these two models, he opened his own new diary on November 20, 1825 and wrote the first entry.Lockhart (1896) p. 572Anderson (1998) p. 3Hewitt (1981) p. xx Only two days later he noted doubts as to the financial stability of the publisher Archibald Constable & Co., which concerned him greatly since he had a large stake in the firm.Anderson (1998) p. 10 His worst fears were realized the following year when Constable failed, bringing James Ballantyne & Co., in which Scott was a partner, down with him. Scott found himself personally liable for debts totalling more than ¬£125,000. He resolved to pay off the debts by his own labours as a novelist rather than accept bankruptcy, and the Journal records his unceasing efforts to do this as he writes a series of novels and histories, including Woodstock, The Surgeon's Daughter, The Fair Maid of Perth, Anne of Geierstein, Count Robert of Paris, The Siege of Malta, Bizarro, The Life of Napoleon Buonaparte and Tales of a Grandfather. Other disasters are recorded in the Journal, such as the death of his wife in 1826, and a series of strokes which increasingly undermined his physical and mental powers. In July 1828 he allowed the habit of keeping his journal to lapse for several months, but returned to the task from January 1829 to July 1829 and from May 1830 to May 1831. In October 1831 he again resumed the Journal, having been offered ¬£1000 or ¬£1500 by his publisher Robert Cadell for some record of his forthcoming voyage to Malta and Italy. He finally abandoned work on it in Naples in April 1832, the last entry ending in the middle of a sentence.Anderson (1998) p. 800 == Critical reception == From the time of the Journal‚Äôs first publication extraordinary claims have been made for it. In 1891 Algernon Swinburne wrote that \\"The too long delayed publication of his Journal is in every way an almost priceless benefit; but as a final illustration and attestation of a character almost incomparably lovable, admirable, and noble, it is a gift altogether beyond price.\\" The biographer Hesketh Pearson thought it \\"Perhaps the most valuable, certainly the most moving, of all his productions; and, since it displays a man whose goodness of heart balanced his greatness of mind, incomparably the most interesting work of its kind ever written.\\"Pearson (1987) p. 218 The novelist Hugh Walpole called it \\"that masterpiece of human nature\\". For Virginia Woolf, \\"Scott's Journals are the best life of Scott in existence...they contain Scott in his glory and Scott in his gloom...in a few passages Scott throws more light upon his genius and its limitations than all his critics in their innumerable volumes\\". The Scott scholar David Hewitt agreed, writing that \\"There is no greater or more moving diary in English\\"; however he also made the point that its fine artistic shape cannot be credited to Scott, since he quite fortuitously took up the Journal as the tragedy of his last years was about to begin.Hewitt (1981) p. xxiii The literary historian Oliver Elton believed that the Journal‚Äôs high place in English literature was secure: \\"Whatever else of Scott's may lose its colour with time, the Journal cannot do so, with its accurate, unexaggerated language of pain.\\" Lockhart believed that Scott knew his Journal would eventually be published, but he nevertheless called it \\"The most candid Diary that ever man penned\\".Anderson (1998) pp. xxiii-xxivLockhart (1896) p. 573 The theme of the Journal's candour has been taken up by many later critics. C. S. Lewis considered that it was \\"One of the sincerest books in the world, and (what is not exactly the same thing) full of self- knowledge.\\" The novelist John Buchan wrote that \\"It is one of the most complete expressions of a human soul that we possess‚Ä¶ There is no reticence and no posturing, because he is speaking to his own soul‚Ä¶The greatest figure he ever drew is in the Journal, and it is the man Walter Scott.\\" W. E. K. Anderson added the other side of the coin: \\"It is candid about Scott himself. It is neither informative nor candid about other people.\\" The novelist and critic A. N. Wilson judged it to be a truthful record of an unusual kind: > There is nothing in it which can be contradicted by other biographical > evidence‚Ä¶Yet there is something extremely conscious about it. It is far more > than a work of art. Scott was not making himself out to be someone that he > was not; rather, the Journal is his record of how he made himself conform to > the heroic standards of his own fictions‚Ä¶Scott was intent on facing [his > difficulties and sorrows] with the bravado of Burley and the stubbornness of > Jeanie Deans. John Sutherland offered a dissenting view of the Journal's sincerity. He thought that Scott, foreseeing eventual publication, took the opportunity to influence history's view of his financial crisis: \\"In these appallingly humiliating circumstances it evidently became more important than ever that he should preserve a noble image of himself in extremis for posterity.\\" == Editions == * J. G. Lockhart Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart. in 7 volumes (Edinburgh: Robert Cadell, 1837).

This was inspired by the memory of successful interprovincial camogie matches which were played as part of the 1928 and 1932 Tailteann Games programmes. The GAA's railway cup tournaments were then at the height of their popularity, attracting a record attendance of 49,023 to their St Patrick's Day finals double fixture of 1954 and 52,619.to the hrulign final of 1955. It was chosen to play ain inter-provincial match on 19 September 1954 in Navan as part of the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Camogie Association, as a tribute to Navan's rople in hosting the very first camogie match in July 1954. Munster beat Ulster by 8‚Äì3 to 5‚Äì3 in a match that was described as the best of the year. Con Keneally wrote in the Irish Independent > In no way perturbed by the heavy rain that fell for most of the game the two > teams gave an admirable display. Kathleen Mills and Una O'Connor had first > class games. Una O'Connor was particularly prominent at the end as was the > full forward Kay Douglas who had to work very hard before she got the better > of the Ulster full back Moya Forde. It still took two years for the new inter-provincial tournament to reach fruition. Notwithstanding the role of the rival Conradh na Gaeilge in the foundation and early history of camogie, Irish language organisation Gael Linn donated a trophy for inter-provincial competition, which was handed by Gael Linn trustee M√°ire Breathnach to Sile Nic an Ultaigh at a ceremony in Dublin on 11 November 1956 Donal √ì Mor√°in said Gael Linn were delighted to show special appreciation of the Camogie Association because > It is one of those national bodies which has done so much for the Irish > sport. I hope the Gael Linn competition will encourage more colleges to give > preference to caogie in their sporting activities. ==The Final== Leinster defeated Munster, 6‚Äì4 to 4‚Äì2 at Cahir. Ulster got a bye to the final as Connacht did not enter a team. Leinster then defeated Ulster, 7‚Äì1 to 3‚Äì1, in the final at Knockbridge, Co Louth with prolific Dublin forward, Una OConnor scoring five goals.Report of final in Irish Press, 19 November 1956Report of final in Irish Independent, 19 November 1956Report of final in Irish Times, 19 November 1956Report of final in Irish Examiner, 19 November 1956Report of final in Irish News, 19 November 1956 Agnes Hourigan wrote in the Irish Press: > The Leinster captain Annette Corrigan was brilliant throughout and gave her > side great inspiration as she controlled the midfield.

Its first military loading was from Moji to Manila with convoy Hi-45 in February 1944.

It returned to Japan with convoy Hi-62 in early June to transport the IJA 5th Field Heavy Artillery and 58th Independent Mixed Brigade to the Philippines with convoy MOMA-01 in July. It returned to Japan in early August with convoy Hi-68. == Loss == Tamatsu Maru departed Pusan on 8 August 1944 carrying the Japanese 2nd Battalion and regimental headquarters of the 13th Independent Infantry Regiment from Korea for defense of the Philippines. It joined convoy Hi-71 departing Moji on 10 August, and stopping at the Mako naval base in the Pescadores on 15 August. Convoy Hi-71 departed Mako on 17 August and was discovered by that evening. Redfish assembled other submarines for a radar-guided wolfpack attack on the evening of 18 August in heavy rainBlair, pp.676‚Äì680 and force 12 winds from the southeast. As the convoy was scattered by heavy seas and evasive maneuvers, Tamatsu Maru apparently became separated from convoy escorts. Spadefish found Tamatsu Maru on a northerly course about 0330 19 August and fired a salvo of six torpedoes. Spadefish heard two torpedoes hit. Convoy escorts were unaware of the ship's location until one of them discovered thousands of floating bodies that afternoon. The sinking of Tamatsu Maru was the fourth worst loss of life on any Japanese vessel during the war. == See also == *List by death toll of ships sunk by submarines ==Sources== * * * ==Notes== Category:Ships built in Japan Category:1943 ships Category:Maritime incidents in August 1944 Category:Ships sunk by American submarines ","title":"Tamatsu Maru"},{"id":"35242789","text":"Quebracho is an Argentine 1974 film directed by Ricardo Wullicher.

In a 2011 interview, Caputo claimed she had the ability to communicate with dead people: \\"Things are just there. When I was younger I used to actually see images and hear things. As I got older and shut down, it has changed. Because it was frightening to see people standing there who actually weren't there.\\" ==Reception== Scientific skeptics say mediumship performances are a con, and that Caputo's seemingly paranormal performances are simply the result of well-known exploits like the Forer effect, cold reading, selective editing of the show, and her subjects' eagerness to believe. In 2012, the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) awarded Caputo its Pigasus Award for being, in its view, the \\"psychic\\" performer who fooled the greatest number of people with the least effort in the preceding year. A Pigasus award was also given to TLC for continuing to air the show. In an article published by Wired Magazine the organization's founder James Randi explained why he believed shows like Long Island Medium were deceptive and potentially harmful to its participants: In June of that year, Caputo appeared in a commercial for Priceline.com in which she portrayed herself \\"connecting\\" with the late Priceline Negotiator character previously played by William Shatner. However, this commercial has sparked controversy, since the commercial appears to make light of the Native American belief of smudging. JREF President DJ Grothe issued a statement decrying Priceline.com: \\"It is difficult to watch the show and not feel heartbroken for those who are desperate to hear from the departed... and even more so if they are being manipulated by a charlatan.\\" Grothe urged the organization to have their new spokeswoman take the James Randi Million Dollar Challenge and prove her paranormal claims. Inside Edition examined Caputo's claims of being able to talk to the dead and found them lacking as she performed live, saying they \\"watched her strike out time and again.\\" Mark Edward, who used to portray himself as a medium, gave his opinion that Caputo does not have supernatural powers and explained several common techniques she could be using to pretend to have such abilities. She responded in a statement: \\"I respect and understand skeptics. I'm not trying to prove anything to anyone, that's not why I do what I do. I feel, and have been told by my clients, that my gift has really helped them, and that's all that matters to me.\\" Ron Tebo, proprietor of the YouTube debunking channel SciFake, has appeared on numerous programs saying Caputo engages in several forms of deception, including sending staff members to interview audience members in advance in order to be able to acquire knowledge to claim communication with the dead. In March 2018, skeptical activist Susan Gerbic published an article in Skeptical Inquirer summarizing a number of techniques which she says are used by psychics, such as Caputo, to achieve their effects. Not all the feedback from the show has been entirely negative. While noting that Caputo's claim of special powers \\"has been questioned\\", Variety's Gregg Goldstein described her in generally positive terms in a 2012 article, writing, \\"In an era of hit reality shows about families and denizens of New Jersey, the series' equally big selling point is the dynamic with her husband and two wisecracking teenagers, making it play like a combination of Real Housewives of New Jersey and Bewitched ‚Äì particularly when their frustrations surface over her random communications with what she calls 'Spirit. In a 2019 segment of Last Week Tonight, which featured Caputo as well as other prominent TV psychics, John Oliver criticized the media for producing shows such as this, because they convince viewers that psychic powers are real, and so enable neighborhood psychics to prey on grieving families. Oliver said \\"...when psychic abilities are presented as authentic, it emboldens a vast underworld of unscrupulous vultures, more than happy to make money by offering an open line to the afterlife, as well as many other bullshit services.\\" ==Cast== Main * Theresa Caputo Recurring * Larry Caputo Jr. * Victoria Caputo * Larry Caputo ==Episodes== Series Overview Season 1 (2011) { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:72%;\\" - !

He previously played for the Yokohama BayStars from 2008 to 2010 and the Orix Buffaloes from 2011 to 2014. ==Early Baseball Career== He started playing little league baseball in 4th grade for the Nabari Elementary School in Mie Prefecture. He went on to become the ace of Tsuda Gakuen High, but his school never made it to any national tournaments. He entered Nara Sangyo University and pitched regularly in the Kinki University Baseball League. In the spring of 2007, he pitched a perfect game against Nara University, earned 6 wins and helped his team win the league championship for the 3rd consecutive tournament. In all his 47 league appearances, he finished with a 26-2 win-loss record, 1.38 ERA and 255 strikeouts, and won one MVP, one Best Pitcher Award, a Fighting Spirit Award (Kantoushou Êï¢ÈóòË≥û) and got selected into the Best Nine 3 times. ==Yokohama DeNa Baystars (2008-2010)== Kuwahara with the BayStars farm team Shonan Searex in 2010 He got selected as the Baystars' 3rd pick during the 2007 NPB professional baseball draft. He inked a 70 million yen contract for a 12 million yen annual salary, and got assigned the jersey number 38. He debuted as a reliever against the Carps on April 6, 2008. He then alternated as a starter and reliever in his following appearances, and earned his first win on July 9 when he pitched 2 scoreless innings in relief against the Swallows. On August 16, he threw 150 pitches to claim a complete shutout victory against the Tigers in Kyocera Dome. The rest of his outings were not so good however, and he finished the season with 3 wins, 6 losses, 1 hold and a 4.74 ERA. He performed better as a reliever with 2.45 ERA in 20 games, than as a starter with 6.75 ERA in 10 games. He suffered from an injury during the pre-season games in 2009, and only managed to get back to the main squad in mid-August where he pitched mostly as a reliever thereafter. This role continued in 2010, but his appearances gradually decreased as he fell into a slump. As a result, he and Shingo Nonaka got traded to the Orix Buffaloes for Ikki Shimamura by the end of the 2010 season. ==Orix Buffaloes (2011-2014)== Kuwahara with Orix in 2011 He got 10 appearances in 2011, but recorded no wins and a 3.50 ERA. He spent the next year pitching in the Western League (farm), where he finished with a 5-1 record and 2.61 ERA out of 22 games. He got a handful of appearances with the main squad in the next two seasons, but he spent the majority in the farm. After making just 22 appearances in 4 years for Orix, he was traded to the Hanshin Tigers at the end of the 2014 season for pitcher Hirokazu Shiranita as Orix was short of starters and Hanshin was short of relievers. He inherited Shiranita's former jersey number, 64. ==Hanshin Tigers== 2015 As soon as he joined the Tigers, his reliever skills were immediately put to the test during the season opening game. But as he continued to give away runs in his next 4 outings, he was eventually sent back to the farm. He had 2 more appearances in May, but he spent the remainder of the season pitching in the Western League games. 2016 He continued to struggle with his pitching and only appeared in a handful of farm games. But after training to adjust his mechanics, he eventually improved and finished the season with a 2.42 ERA out of 29 games (1 win, 3 losses, 2 saves). 2017 His now stable pitching got him through 8 pre- season games with a 1.17 ERA, and earned him a spot in the season opener. Afterwards, he and Marcos Mateo worked together as the main set-up relievers to closer Rafael Dolis during matches where the Tigers have a narrow lead. On the April 5 match against the Swallows, he finally earned his first win as a Tiger, 7 years after he last got one in 2010 from the same opponent. From then onward, he appeared in 16 consecutive games until May 21, and from May 27 until July 18 (including 10 Inter-league games), he pitched in relief for 19 consecutive games without giving away a single run. He finished the season as Hanshin's top reliever with 67 game appearances, 1.51 ERA, 39 holds, 4 wins and 2 losses. ==Pitching Style== With three quarters delivery, he throws a four-seam fastball up to a speed of and a cutter that sharply changes course just as it approaches the batter. Also included in his arsenal is a slider that follows a large hooking motion. He struggled with control issues before joining the Tigers, but through the guidance of farm pitching coach Yasuo Kubo, they slowly altered his pitching mechanics during the 2016 season. The training made a drastic improvement in his pitching consistency, and resulted to his breakthrough performance in 2017 and his league topping K/BB ratio in 2018. ==References *NPB.com Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Baseball people from Mie Prefecture Category:Japanese baseball players Category:Nippon Professional Baseball pitchers Category:Yokohama BayStars players Category:Orix Buffaloes players Category:Hanshin Tigers players ","title":"Kentaro Kuwahara"},{"id":"35243108","text":"Ralph was Archdeacon of Barnstaple until 1143.\\"Memorials of Barnstaple; being an attempt to supply the want of a history of that ancient borough\\" Gribble, J.B: Barnstaple, J.Avery, 1830 ==References== Category:Archdeacons of Barnstaple ","title":"Ralph (Archdeacon of Barnstaple)"},{"id":"35243111","text":"Shahrak-e Modarres () is a village in Qaleh Hashem Rural District, Shal District, Buin Zahra County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

Angelou (1928‚Äì2014) is best known for her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969). The rest of the books in her series are Gather Together in My Name (1974), Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas (1976), The Heart of a Woman (1981), All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes (1986), A Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002), and Mom & Me & Mom (2013). Beginning with Caged Bird and ending with her final autobiography, Angelou uses the metaphor of a bird (which represents the confinement of racism and depression) struggling to escape its cage, as described in the Paul Laurence Dunbar poem \\"Sympathy\\". Angelou's autobiographies can be placed in the African-American literature tradition of political protest. Their unity underscores one of Angelou's central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. According to scholar Pierre A. Walker, all of Angelou's books describe \\"a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression\\". In the course of her autobiographies, her views about Black-white relationships changed and she learned to accept different points of view. Angelou's theme of identity was established from the beginning of her autobiographies, with the opening lines in Caged Bird, and like other female writers in the late 1960s and early 1970s, she used the autobiography to reimagine ways of writing about women's lives and identities in a male- dominated society. Her original goal was to write about the lives of Black women in America, but it evolved in her later volumes to document the ups and downs of her own personal and professional life. The theme of family and family relationships‚Äîfrom the character-defining experience of Angelou's parents' abandonment in Caged Bird to her relationships with her son, husbands, friends, and lovers‚Äîare important in all of her books. As in American autobiography generally and in African-American autobiography specifically, which has its roots in the slave narrative, travel is another important theme in Angelou's autobiographies. Scholar Yolanda M. Manora called the travel motif in Angelou's autobiographies, beginning in Caged Bird, \\"a central metaphor for a psychic mobility\\".Manora, p. 373 Angelou's autobiographies \\"stretch time and place\\",Lupton, p. 1 from Arkansas to Africa and back to the US, and span almost forty years, beginning from the start of World War II to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. ==Overview== Maya Angelou, in 2013, at 85 years old. Before writing I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings at the age of forty, Maya Angelou had a long and varied career, holding jobs such as composer, singer, actor, civil rights worker, journalist, and educator. In the late 1950s, she joined the Harlem Writers Guild, where she met a number of important African-American authors, including her friend and mentor James Baldwin. After hearing civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. speak for the first time in 1960, she was inspired to join the Civil Rights Movement. She organized several benefits for him, and he named her Northern Coordinator of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She worked for several years in Ghana, West Africa, as a journalist, actress, and educator. She was invited back to the US by Malcolm X to work for him shortly before his assassination in 1965.Gillespie et al, p. 81 In 1968, King asked her to organize a march, but he too was assassinated on April 4, which also happened to be her birthday. Angelou was deeply depressed in the months following King's assassination, so to help lift her spirits, Baldwin brought her to a dinner party at the home of cartoonist Jules Feiffer and his wife Judy in late 1968. The guests began telling stories of their childhoods and Angelou's stories impressed Judy Feiffer. The next day she called Robert Loomis at Random House, who became Angelou's editor throughout her long writing career until he retired in 2011, and \\"told him that he ought to get this woman to write a book\\". At first, Angelou refused, since she thought of herself as a poet and playwright.Walker, p. 17 According to Angelou, Baldwin had a \\"covert hand\\" in getting her to write the book, and advised Loomis to use \\"a little reverse psychology\\", and reported that Loomis tricked her into it by daring her: \\"It's just as well\\", he said, \\"because to write an autobiography as literature is just about impossible\\". Angelou was unable to resist a challenge, and she began writing Caged Bird. Angelou did not write Caged Bird with the intention of writing a series of autobiographies, however critics have \\"judged the subsequent autobiographies in light of the first\\", with Caged Bird generally receiving the highest praise. Angelou's autobiographies have a distinct style, and \\"stretch over time and place\\", from Arkansas to Africa and back to the U.S. They take place from the beginnings of World War II to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. According to scholar Mary Jane Lupton, Angelou's autobiographies have been characterized as autobiographical fiction, but Lupton disagrees, stating that they conform to the genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme.Lupton, p. 32 Angelou's use of themes, especially that of racism, connects all seven autobiographies. One of her goals, beginning with Caged Bird, was to incorporate \\"organic unity\\" into them, and the events she described were episodic, crafted like a series of short stories, and were placed to emphasize the themes of her books. Through the writing of her life stories in her autobiographies, Angelou became recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women. According to scholar Joanne Braxton, it made her \\"without a doubt ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer\\". Beginning with Caged Bird, Angelou used the same \\"writing ritual\\" for many years, for most of her books and poetry.Lupton, p. 15 She would get up at five in the morning and check into a hotel room, where the staff were instructed to remove any pictures from the walls. She wrote on yellow legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, Roget's Thesaurus, and the Bible, and left by the early afternoon. She averaged 10‚Äì12 pages of material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. Lupton stated that this ritual indicated \\"a firmness of purpose and an inflexible use of time\\". Angelou went through this process to give herself time to turn the events of her life into art, and to \\"enchant\\" herself; as she said in a 1989 interview with the BBC, to \\"relive the agony, the anguish, the Sturm und Drang\\". She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird, to \\"tell the human truth\\" about her life. Critic Opal Moore says about Caged Bird: \\"...Though easily read, [it] is no 'easy read'\\".Moore, p. 55. Angelou stated that she played cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, \\"It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it‚Äîha! It's so delicious!\\" She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in \\"telling the truth\\". ==Racism==  Caged Bird and Gather Together  Angelou uses the metaphor of a bird struggling to escape its cage described in the Paul Laurence Dunbar poem \\"Sympathy\\" throughout all of her autobiographies; she uses the metaphor in the titles of both I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and her sixth autobiography A Song Flung Up to Heaven. Like elements within a prison narrative, the \\"caged bird\\" represents Angelou's confinement resulting from racism and oppression.Lupton, pp. 38‚Äì39 This metaphor also invokes the \\"supposed contradiction of the bird singing in the midst of its struggle\\". Reviewer Hilton Als observed that Angelou's witnessing of the evil in her society, as directed towards Black women, shaped Angelou's young life and informed her views into adulthood. Scholar Lynn Z. Bloom asserted that Angelou's autobiographies and lectures, which she called \\"ranging in tone from warmly humorous to bitterly satiric\\", have gained a respectful and enthusiastic response from the general public and critics. { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; color:black; width:28em; max-width: 40%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  I know why the caged bird sings, ah me, When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,‚Äî When he beats his bars and would be free; It is not a carol of joy or glee, But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core, But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings‚Äî I know why the caged bird sings! -  style=\\"text-align: left;\\" ‚Äî Third and final stanza of Paul Lawrence Dunbar's poem \\"Sympathy\\". } Reviewer Daisy Aldan of World Literature Today criticized Angelou for harboring \\"a fanatic hostility expressed toward all white people\\", Quoted in Hagen, p. 3. but writer Lyman B. Hagen disagreed, stating that like Angelou's friend and mentor Langston Hughes, Angelou explained and illuminated the conditions of African Americans, but without alienating her readers of any race.Hagen, p. 4 Hagen also argued that Angelou promotes the importance of hard work, a common theme in slave narratives, throughout all her autobiographies, in order to break stereotypes of laziness associated with African-Americans.Hagen, p. 8 For instance, Angelou's description of the strong and cohesive Black community of Stamps demonstrates how African Americans have subverted repressive institutions to withstand racism.McPherson, p. 37 Angelou evolved from wishing that she could become white in Caged Bird to being \\"forced to contend with her blackness\\". Critic Pierre A. Walker placed Angelou's autobiographies in the African-American literature tradition of political protest written in the years following the American Civil Rights Movement. He emphasized that the unity of Angelou's autobiographies underscored one of her central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. Angelou's autobiographies, beginning with Caged Bird, consisted of \\"a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression\\". This sequence led Angelou, as the protagonist, from \\"helpless rage and indignation to forms of subtle resistance, and finally to outright and active protest\\". In the course of her work, Angelou changed her views about Black-white relationships and learned to accept different points of view. It was the changes in how she regarded race and her views of white people that provided Angelou with freedom. According to Hagen, one of Angelou's themes was that humans tend to be more alike than different.Hagen, p. 7 { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin- right: 2em; font-size: 85%; color:black; width:28em; max-width: 40%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  I note the obvious differences between each sort and type, but we are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike. -  style=\\"text-align: left;\\" ‚Äî Maya Angelou, 1990 Scholar Mary Jane Lupton has called this one of Angelou's most well-known sayings.Lupton, p. 20  style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  } Angelou's goal, beginning with Caged Bird, was to \\"tell the truth about the lives of black women\\". Like her other autobiographies, she described her living arrangements, how she coped within the context of a larger white society, and the ways that her story played out within that context. Critic Selwyn Cudjoe stated that in Angelou's second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name, Angelou was concerned with the questions of what it meant to be a Black woman in the U.S. in the years immediately following World War II. Written three years after Caged Bird,Lupton (1999), p. 131 Gather Together \\"depicts a single mother's slide down the social ladder into poverty and crime\\".Lauret, p. 120 It begins with a prologue describing the confusion and disillusionment of the African- American community during that time, which matched the alienated and fragmented nature of the main character's life. According to critic Dolly A. McPherson, African Americans were promised a new racial order that never materialized.McPherson, p. 63 Angelou also compares and contrasts how she and her grandmother dealt with racism; Angelou with defiance and the pragmatic take of her grandmother, who had learned that defiance was dangerous.Hagen, pp. 80‚Äì82 In 1971, Angelou published her first volume of poetry, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), which became a bestseller and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.Gillespie et al, p. 103 (It was Angelou's early practice to alternate a prose volume with a poetry volume.Hagen, p. 118)  Singin' and Swingin'  Angelou's third autobiography Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas (1976) marked the first time a well-known African-American woman writer had expanded her life story into a third autobiography.Lupton, p. 98 She marries a white man, and comes into intimate contact with whites who were very different from the racists she encountered in her childhood. She discovered that her distrust of whites had developed to protect herself from their cruelty and indifference.Cudjoe, p. 22 As McPherson indicated, \\"Conditioned by earlier experiences, Angelou distrusts everyone, especially whites. Nevertheless, she is repeatedly surprised by the kindness and goodwill of many whites she meets, and, thus, her suspicions begin to soften into understanding\\".McPherson, p. 82 Cudjoe wrote that in Singin' and Swingin', Angelou effectively demonstrated \\"the inviolability of the African American personhood\\",Cudjoe, p. 8 as well as her own closely guarded defense of it. In order for her to have any positive relationships with whites and people of other races; however, McPherson insisted that Angelou \\"must examine and discard her stereotypical views about Whites\\". Scholar Lyman B. Hagen agreed and pointed out that Angelou had to re-examine her lingering prejudices when faced with a broader world full of different kinds of white people.Hagen, p. 87 The stories she tells in Singin' and Swingin' contain \\"strong forceful statements that convey firmly her indignation and ire about black displacement\\".Hagen, p. 92 For example, when she marries Tosh Angelos against her mother's advice and wishes, she experiences negative reactions from others. Although Tosh treated her and her son Guy well at the beginning of their marriage, he quickly tired of their relationship and she felt used and betrayed by another white man.Hagen, p. 89 Angelou moved between the white and Black worlds, both defining herself as a member of her community and encountering whites in \\"a much fuller, more sensuous manner\\".Cudjoe, p. 21 She describes the tension she experienced as a Black woman entertainer, functioning in the white-dominated world of the 1950s. Her perceptions of relationships between Blacks and whites had to be constantly modified, despite the attitudes and ideas about whites she learned from her mother and grandmother. Angelou's feelings about race and racism were ambivalent as she began to have increasingly positive experiences with white people. Heart of a Woman Martin Luther King Jr. Angelou's work with King was called \\"successful and efficient\\".Hagen, p. 103 By the time Angelou's fourth autobiography, The Heart of a Woman, was published in 1981, the success of her previous autobiographies and the publication of three volumes of poetry had brought Angelou a considerable amount of fame.Lupton, p. 118 The book opens with Angelou and her son Guy living in an experimental commune with whites, in an attempt to participate in the new openness between Blacks and whites. She was not completely comfortable with the arrangement, however; as Lupton pointed out, Angelou was still distrustful of whites and never named or described the characters of her roommates.Lupton, pp. 120‚Äì121 For the most part, Angelou freely interacts with white people in this book, but she occasionally encounters prejudice reminiscent of her early years, such as when she requires the assistance of white friends to rent a home in a segregated neighborhood.Lupton, p. 121 Lupton stated that compared to her other books, Angelou had come \\"a long way\\" in her interactions with whites and people of other races. She remained suspicious of white liberals, but reported on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s optimism about race relations and other positive interactions with whites. Angelou maintains her indictment of the white power structure, and her protests against racial injustice became a theme throughout all her books. Instead of offering solutions, however, she simply reports on, reacts to, and dramatizes events.Hagen, pp. 104‚Äì105 Angelou became more \\"politicized\\"McPherson, p. 91 in The Heart of Woman, and developed a new sense of Black identity. McPherson argued that even Angelou's decision to leave show business was political,McPherson, p. 92 and regarded this book as \\"a social and cultural history of Black Americans\\"McPherson, p. 93 during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Angelou saw herself as a historian of both the Civil Rights movement and the Black literary movement.Hagen, p. 102 She became more attracted to the causes of Black militants, both in the U.S. and in Africa, to the point of entering into a relationship with South African freedom fighter Vusumzi Make, and became more committed to activism. She became an active political protestor during this period, and she used the autobiographical form to demonstrate how the Civil Rights movement influenced one person involved in it. According to Hagen, her contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and SCLC organizer were successful and effective.Hagen, pp. 103‚Äì104 Traveling Shoes According to Lupton, \\"Angelou's exploration of her African and African-American identities\\"Lupton, p. 139 was an important theme in her fifth autobiography All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes (1986). McPherson called Travelling Shoes \\"a mixture of Maya Angelou's personal recollection and a historical document of the time in which it is set\\",McPherson, p. 105 the early 1960s. This was the first time that many Black Americans, due to the independence of Ghana and other African states, as well as the emergence of African leaders such as Kwame Nkrumah, were able to view Africa in a positive way. Ghana was \\"the center of an African cultural renaissance\\"McPherson, p. 107. and of Pan-Africanism during this time. The alliances and relationships with the people Angelou met in Ghana contributed to her identity and growth.Lupton, p. 152 Her experiences as an expatriate helped her come to terms with her personal and historical past, and by the end of the book she is ready to return to America with a deeper understanding of both the African and American parts of her character. McPherson called Angelou's parallels and connections between Africa and America her \\"double-consciousness\\",McPherson, p. 113 which contributed to her understanding of herself. In Traveling Shoes, Angelou is able to recognize similarities between African and African-American culture; as Lupton put it, the \\"blue songs, shouts, and gospels\\" she has grown up with in America \\"echo the rhythms of West Africa\\".Lupton, p. 154 Marcia Ann Gillespie and her colleagues, writing in A Glorious Celebration, published in 2008 for Angelou's 80th birthday, agreed, stating that Angelou recognized the connections between African and American Black cultures, including the children's games, the folklore, the spoken and non-verbal languages, the food, sensibilities, and behavior.Gillespie et al, p. 69 She connects the behavior of many African mother figures, especially their generosity, with her grandmother's actions. In one of the most significant sections of Traveling Shoes, Angelou recounts an encounter with a West African woman who recognized her, on the basis of her appearance, as a member of the Bambara group of West Africa. These and other experiences in Ghana demonstrated Angelou's maturity, as a mother able to let go of her adult son, as a woman no longer dependent upon a man, and as an American able to \\"perceive the roots of her identity\\"Lupton, pp. 156‚Äì157 and how they affected her personality. Also in Traveling Shoes, Angelou comes to terms with her difficult past, both as a descendant of Africans taken forcibly to America as slaves and as an African America who had experienced segregation and Jim Crow racism. As she told an interviewer, she brought her son to Ghana to protect him from the negative effects of racism because she did not think he had the tools to withstand them. For the first time in their lives, she and Guy did not \\"feel threatened by racial hate\\"Angelou, p. 152 in Ghana. The theme of racism was still an important theme in Traveling Shoes, but Angelou had matured in the way she dealt with it. As Hagen stated, Angelou was \\"not yet ready to toss off the stings of prejudice, but tolerance and even a certain understanding can be glimpsed\\".Hagen, p. 109 This was demonstrated in Angelou's treatment of the \\"genocidal involvement of Africans in slave-trading\\", something that has often been overlooked or misrepresented by other Black writers. Angelou was taught an important lesson about combating racism by Malcolm X, who compared it to a mountain in which everyone's efforts were needed to overcome it. Angelou learned about herself and about racism throughout Traveling Shoes, even during her brief tour of Venice and Berlin for the revival of The Blacks, the play by Jean Genet that Angelou had originally performed in 1961;Lupton, p. 140 reuniting with the play's original cast, she revived her passion for African- American culture and values, \\"putting them into perspective\\" as she compared them with Germany's history of racial prejudice and military aggression.Lupton, p. 155 The verbal violence of the folk tales shared during her luncheon with her German hosts and Israeli friend was as significant to Angelou as physical violence, to the point that she became ill. Angelou's experience with fascism in Italy, her performances with 'The Blacks cast, and the reminders of the holocaust in Germany, \\"help[ed] shape and broaden her constantly changing vision\\" Lupton, p. 156 regarding racial prejudice, clarified her perceptions of African Americans, and \\"contribute to her reclaiming herself and her evolution as a citizen of the world\\". ==Identity== The theme of identity was established from the beginning of Angelou's series of autobiographies, with the opening lines in Caged Bird, which \\"foretell Angelou's autobiographical project: to write the story of the developing black female subject by sharing the tale of one Southern Black girl's becoming\\".Manora, p. 359 Angelou and other female writers in the late 1960s and early 1970s used the autobiography to reimagine ways of writing about women's lives and identities in a male-dominated society. Feminist scholar Maria Lauret has made a connection between Angelou's autobiographies, which Lauret called \\"fictions of subjectivity\\" and \\"feminist first-person narratives\\",Lauret, p. 98 with fictional first-person narratives (such as The Women's Room by Marilyn French and The Golden Notebook by Doris Lessing) written during the same period. Both genres employed the narrator as protagonist and used \\"the illusion of presence in their mode of signification\\". Scholar Yolanda M. Manora agreed, stating that Angelou broke stereotypes of African-American women by describing these images and stereotypes, and then disproving them, which set the stage for Angelou's identity development in her later autobiographies. { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; color:black; width:28em; max-width: 40%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\" When I try to describe myself to God I say, \\"Lord, remember me? Black? Female? Six-foot tall? The writer?\\" And I almost always get God's attention. -  style=\\"text-align: left;\\" ‚Äî Maya Angelou, 2008. } As a Black woman, Angelou demonstrates the formation of her own cultural identity throughout her narratives, and has used her many roles, incarnations, and identities to connect the layers of oppression within her personal history. Angelou also presents herself as a role model for African-American women more broadly by reconstructing the Black woman's image through themes of individual strength and the ability to overcome.Lauret, p. 97 Throughout her work, Angelou explores the women who influenced her evolution and growth. According to Manora, three characters in Caged Bird, Angelou's mother Vivian, her grandmother Annie Henderson, and Mrs. Flowers (who helps Angelou find her voice again after her rape), collaborated to \\"form a triad which serves as the critical matrix in which the child is nurtured and sustained during her journey through Southern Black girlhood\\".Manora, p. 367 Angelou's original goal was to write about the lives of Black women in America, but her voluminous work documents the ups and downs of her own life as well. Angelou's autobiographies provide a historical overview of the places she has lived and how she coped within the context of a racist white society. In her third autobiography, Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas, Angelou successfully demonstrates the integrity of the African-American character as she began to experience more positive interactions with whites. In Angelou's second volume, Gather Together in My Name, she was concerned with what it meant to be a Black female in the U.S., through the lens of her own experience. Writer Selwyn Cudjoe said regarding her second autobiography: \\"It is almost as though the incidents in the text were simply 'gathered together' under the name of Maya Angelou\\".Cudjoe, p. 20 ==Family== According to scholar Dolly McPherson, the theme of family and family relationships, which she called \\"kinship concerns\\",McPherson, p. 14 in Angelou's books begins with \\"a preoccupation with the traditional nuclear family\\", despite Angelou's experience of being abandoned by her parents in Caged Bird. Eventually, however, Angelou's concept of family expands to the extended family in which \\"trust is the key to a display of kinship concerns\\". Scholar Mary Jane Lupton insists that the concept of family must be understood in light of Maya and Bailey's displacement.Lupton, p. 11 Angelou's description of close familial relationships, such as her relationships with her parents and son (which Lupton called \\"the mother-child pattern\\") was a unifying theme that connected all of her autobiographies. Motherhood was a recurring theme, explored through Angelou's experiences as a single mother, a daughter, and a granddaughter. Lupton believed that Angelou's plot construction and character development were influenced by the mother/child motif found in the work of Harlem Renaissance poet Jessie Fauset.Lupton, p. 49 Scholar Yolanda M. Manora insisted that three women in Caged Bird‚Äîthe \\"hybridized mother\\" of Angelou's grandmother, her mother, and her friend Mrs. Flowers‚Äîtaught her how to be a mother to her son Guy. Although Angelou's grandmother died early in the series, Angelou quotes her grandmother extensively in her third autobiography Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas.Hagen, p. 90 Angelou's desire for security for Guy drove her to marry Tosh Angelos in Singin' and Swingin', and drove many of her other decisions, job choices, and romantic relationships as well.Gillespie et al, p. 31 Scholar Siphokazi Koyana stated that due to Angelou's race and economic background, her \\"experience of motherhood is inseparably intertwined with work\\".Koyana, p. 35 According to Koyana, \\"... Black motherhood always encompassed work\\". Angelou's long list of occupations attests to the challenges, especially in her second autobiography Gather Together in My Name, she faced as a working teenager mother, which often led Angelou to \\"quick and easy\\" decisions.Koyana, p. 36 Koyana stated that it was not until Angelou was able to take advantage of opportunities, such as her role in Porgy and Bess, when she was able to fully support herself and her son Guy, and the quality of her life and her contribution to society improved.Koyana, pp. 36‚Äì37 It was impossible, however, for Angelou to become successful without her extended family to provide childcare;Koyana, p. 37 for example, she left Guy in the care of his grandmother in spite of the conflict and guilt she experienced as a result (something Koyana insisted was imposed on her by the larger society), a pattern established in Caged Bird by her own mother when she left Angelou and her brother in the care of Angelou's grandmother.Koyana, p. 38 { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin- left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; color:black; width:28em; max- width: 40%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\" The woman who survives intact and happy must be at once tender and tough. -  style=\\"text- align: left;\\" ‚Äî Maya Angelou, Wouldn't Take Nothing For My Journey Now (1993) } Black women autobiographers like Angelou have debunked stereotypes surrounding African-American mothers, such as \\"breeder and matriarch\\", and have presented them as having more creative and satisfying roles. According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, Angelou's autobiographies presented Black women differently from their literary portrayals up to that time. O'Neale maintained that \\"no Black woman in the world of Angelou's books are losers\\", and that Angelou was the third generation of intelligent and resourceful women who overcame the obstacles of racism and oppression. Koyana recognized that Angelou depicted women and \\"womanist theories\\" in an era of cultural transition, and that her books described one Black woman's attempts to create and maintain a healthy self-esteem. Angelou's experiences as a working-class single mother challenged traditional and Western viewpoints of women and family life, including the nuclear family structure. Angelou described societal forces, strategies of economic survival, and differential experiences of family structure.Koyana, p. 42 ==Travel== Travel is a common theme in American autobiography as a whole; as McPherson stated, it is something of a national myth to Americans as a people.McPherson, p. 121 This was also the case for African-American autobiography, which was rooted in and developed out of the slave narrative tradition. Like the narratives that focused on the writers' search for freedom from bondage, modern African-American autobiographers like Angelou sought to develop \\"an authentic self\\" and the freedom to find it in their community. Scholar Yolanda M. Manora called the travel motif in Angelou's autobiographies \\"fluidity\\".Manora, p. 374 This fluidity began in Caged Bird and was a metaphor for Angelou's psychological growth, influenced by her displacement and trauma throughout the book, something Manora states that Angelou had to escape in order to transcend. As Hagen stated, Angelou structured Caged Bird into three parts: arrival, sojourn, and departure, with both geographic and psychological aspects.Hagen, p. 58 Map of the cities mentioned during Angelou's European tour with the opera Porgy and Bess, as depicted in her third autobiography, Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas. As McPherson stated, \\"The journey to a distant goal, the return home, and the quest which involves the voyage out, achievement, and return are typical patterns in Black autobiography.\\"McPherson, p. 120 For Angelou, this quest took her from her childhood and adolescence, as described in her first two books, into the adult world. The setting in Angelou's first two autobiographies was limited to three places (Arkansas, Missouri, and California), but the \\"setting breaks open\\"Lupton, p. 99 in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas to include Europe as she traveled with her Porgy and Bess company. McPherson saw Angelou's third autobiography as \\"a sunny tour of Angelou's twenties\\",McPherson, p. 81 from early years marked by disappointments and humiliation, into the broader world and international community. This period described \\"years of joy\\", as well as the start of Angelou's great success and fulfillment as an entertainer. Lupton stated that Angelou's travel narrative in Singin' and Swingin', which took up approximately 40 percent of the book, gave the book its organized structure. However, Angelou's observations about race, gender, and class made the book more than a simple travel narrative.Lupton, pp. 99‚Äì100 As a Black American, her travels around the world put her in contact with many nationalities and classes, expanded her experiences beyond her familiar circle of community and family, and complicated her understandings of race relations.McPherson, p. 85 Angelou continued to expand the settings of her autobiographies in her subsequent volumes. The Heart of a Woman had three primary settings‚Äîthe San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, and Egypt‚Äîand two secondary ones‚ÄîLondon and Accra.Lupton, p. 128-129 Lupton stated that like all of Angelou's books, the structure of The Heart of a Woman was based upon a journey. Angelou emphasized the theme of movement by opening the book with a spiritual (\\"The ole ark's a moverin'\\"), stating, \\"That ancient spiritual could have been the theme song of the United States in 1957\\". This spiritual, which contains a reference to Noah's ark, presents Angelou as a type of Noah and demonstrates her spirituality. Angelou also mentions Allen Ginsberg and On the Road, the 1951 novel by Jack Kerouac, thus connecting her own journey and uncertainty about the future with the journeys of other literary figures.Lupton, pp. 118‚Äì119 Although the reason Angelou traveled to Africa is an eventual failed relationship, she made a connection with the continent, both in this book and in the one that follows it, All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes. As Lupton stated, \\"Africa is the site of her growth\\".Lupton, p. 117 Angelou's time in Africa made her more aware of her African roots. Lupton insisted, however, that although Angelou journeys to many places in the book, the most important journey she described is \\"a voyage into the self\\".Lupton, p. 119 The travel motif is a recurring theme in Traveling Shoes, as evidenced in the book's title, but Angelou's primary motivation for living in Africa, as she told interviewer George Plimpton in 1990, was \\"trying to get home\\". Angelou not only related her own journey of an African-American woman searching for a home, but the journeys of other Black expatriates at the time, and white expatriates in Europe in the 1920s, much like writers such as Ernest Hemingway and Henry James did.McPherson, p. 104 Angelou's issues were resolved at the end of Traveling Shoes when she decided to return to America. She called her departure a \\"second leave-taking\\",Angelou, p. 208 and compared it to the last time she left her son with his grandmother in Singin' and Swingin' when he was a child, and to the forced departure from Africa by her ancestors.Lupton, p. 145 As Lupton states, \\"Angelou's journey from Africa back to America is in certain ways a restatement of the historical phase known as mid-passage, when slaves were brutally transported in ships from West Africa to the so-called New World\\".Lupton, p. 163 Even though Angelou's sixth autobiography A Song Flung Up to Heaven took place in her home country, the travel motif continued. Reviewer Patricia Elam described Song as a \\"journey through an authentic and artistic life\\". ==FootnotesReferencesWorks cited== * Cudjoe, Selwyn (1984). \\"Maya Angelou and the Autobiographical Statement\\".

The film has a rating of four out of five on Time Out's London magazine website while The Daily Telegraph gave it a rating of two out of five and The Independent gave it a rating of one out of five. One reviewer stated that Harper just about pulls off the 'globe- hopping plot involving gangsters, drug deals, heists and more than a touch of double-crossing betrayal' and that whilst the film is 'sometimes predictable, it's never dull, with a fast-paced plot and a terrific cast'. Phelim O'Neill, who reviewed the film for The Guardian, stated that 'it's a low-budget film with enough ambition to take the action overseas, and it's nicely shot'. Joanna Ebuwa, who reviewed the film for Britflicks, stated that 'this is the best British gangster film since Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, it's thoroughly entertaining, funny, nostalgic and pokes fun at the police and the establishment. Harper has been studying from Guy Richie and is definitely one to watch'. John Parrot, who reviewed the film for The Film Review stated that 'St George's Day is so excessive, rude and genuinely Cockney that it may become a cult movie'. In contrast, Stephen Kelly of Total Film stated that 'not even the formidable presence of Charles Dance can salvage a script this woeful'. ==ReferencesCategory:2012 films Category:2012 crime drama films Category:2010s heist films Category:British crime drama films Category:British films Category:British gangster films Category:British heist films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in Amsterdam Category:Films set in Berlin Category:Films set in London Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:2012 directorial debut films Category:2012 drama films ","title":"St George's Day (film)"},{"id":"35243471","text":"Cemetery chapel Margravine Cemetery, also known as Hammersmith Cemetery, is in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham.

The housing project was constructed by the Public Works Administration between 1954 and 1955 . It consisted of eleven 9-story high-rise buildings with a total of 738 apartments . In 2007, Ickes residents recorded acts of police harassment which included strip searches of African-American men as children watched; The footage aired on NBC's Channel 5. On October 9, 2007, Rev. Jesse Jackson along with ministers from Chicago's west side and community members moved into the housing project to bring attention to the harassment situation.Austin Weekly News: Rev.

In the process chemicals are added and air. The rich minerals entrap the air and move as bubbles to the top of a flotation cell while the sand and clays of no commercial values sink to the bottom to form tailings. The whole process may be done in tanks in series called roughers, scavengers and cleaners. In oilsand extraction plants, the froth is formed to remove the bitumen and it is called oilsand froth. Oilsand froth is difficult to pump at very low speeds and at low temperatures. However above a certain speed in a steel pipe, water may separate and form a lubrication layer. The process is called self-lubrication and depending on the temperature (25 C - 45 C), the friction losses are between 10 and 20 times the equivalent friction losses of water. When entering a centrifugal pump, a low pressure forms at the eye of the impeller. Pre-rotation creates centrifugal forces that push the dense slurry towards the wall of the pipe while leaving a core of air at the center. According to Abulnaga (2004), the froth pump may use -( a) a very large eye diameter \\\\- (b) an inducer or having the impeller vanes extend into the suction pipe \\\\- (c) a recirculating pipe from the discharge side of the pump with pressurized froth to break up the bubbles at the eye \\\\- (d) tandem vanes at the impeller shroud \\\\- (e) split or secondary vanes at the shroud \\\\- (f) vertical arrangement, thus: The split vanes in a slurry pump must be thick enough to resist continuous wear.thus: ==References== Category:Pumps ","title":"Froth pump"},{"id":"35243577","text":"Thomas Pigot (Pigott, Piggott) (1657‚Äì1686) was an English cleric, academic and Fellow of the Royal Society. He is known for work in acoustics, and as a committee member for the Society's universal language project. ==Life== He was born in Brindle, Lancashire. He graduated B.A. (1676) at Wadham College, Oxford, becoming Fellow there in 1677, and graduating M.A. in 1678. He was presented to the living of Yarnton in 1681, and was appointed chaplain by James Butler, Earl of Ossory. He died in Ossory's house.Royal Society record, Thomas Pigot.Mary Helen Alicia Dolman Stapleton, Three Oxfordshire Parishes; a history of Kidlington, Yarnton and Begbroke (1893), pp. 225‚Äì6;archive.org. ==Works== Pigot as an undergraduate did research work on acoustics: it revealed the way in which the vibrating string could have stationary nodes. The discoveries (1674) may have been jointly made, with William Noble of Merton College, and the project is thought by some to have been supervised by John Wallis;Norman Davy (editor), British Scientific Literature (1953), p. 56; archive.org. in any case Wallis wrote up the results for publication (1677).Arthur Schuster, Arthur Everett Shipley, Britain's Heritage of Science (1917), p. 50;archive.org. It followed on from earlier work of Francis North, written up in his essay also published in 1677. The nodal points and the related discoveries on sympathetic resonance and the harmonic series were incorporated in the textbook by Wallis, De algebra, in 1693. The resulting theory did not, however, amount to an account of overtones in the modern sense: the connection between vibration in \\"aliquot parts\\", and the higher harmonics, was not clarified in this period. Research was taken further by Joseph Sauveur. Pigot was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1679, and took part in the committee discussions on linguistics. He may have been involved in these debates already by 1678, on John Aubrey's account. John Wilkins, an influential figure in the Society's founding, had died in 1672, and the project of his An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language (1668) was a legacy taken up by Fellows. Debate had started in earnest in 1676, over whether the taxonomic scheme of Wilkins for a universal language could be implemented effectively; committee members included Aubrey, Robert Hooke, Francis Lodwick, John Ray, and Andrew Paschall. Pigot was one of those who remained sceptical about progress on a universal language. But he took part in testing its potential, for example when he joined Paschall and Richard Towneley in making translations of the design by Hooke of a watch mechanism, back from Hooke's \\"real character\\" version. Pigot reported an Oxford earthquake of 1683 in the Philosophical Transactions. ==Notes== Category:1657 births Category:1686 deaths Category:17th-century English Anglican priests Category:English scientists Category:Fellows of Wadham College, Oxford Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:People from the Borough of Chorley ","title":"Thomas Pigot"},{"id":"35243588","text":"Darrin Shane Mooney (born 26 April 1967, Merton, London) is an English session drummer, best known for his work with Primal Scream and Gary Moore.

Older alminhas in the city center such as Rua da Concei√ß√£o-Rua Primeiro de Maio Alminha or Rua dos Ferreiros-Pra√ßa do Almada Alminha have a more elaborate niche, resembling an altarpiece. Traditionally, passers-by would pray and offer alms when passing one in the street. Candles, flowers and alms can be place in the niche. All the city's alminhas are well preserved and kept by the brotherhood. However, due to theft and damage of the shrines, some alminhas no longer accept alms. ==List== Baroque Alminha in an 18th-century house.

H&E; stain. Lymphovascular invasion (LVI or lymphovascular space invasion) is the invasion of a cancer to the blood vessels and/or lymphatics. ==Terminology== Lymph: A clear or white fluid that travels through vessels, moves within tissues and work to keep all the parts of the body clean. Vascular: The body's network of blood vessels. When cancer spreads to lymph and vascular system, it is thus termed as Lymphovascular Invasion. ==Pathology== Lymphovascular invasion, especially in carcinomas, usually precedes spread to the lymph nodes that drain the tissue in which the tumour arose. Conversely, cancers with lymph node spread (known as a lymph node metastases), usually have lymphovascular invasion. Lymph node metastases usually precede secondary tumours, i.e. distant metastases. The absence of LVI in the context of proven lymph node metastasis is usually thought to be due to sampling error. ==Prognostic significance== The predictive value and prevalence of lymphovascular invasion is strongly dependent on the type of cancer. In other words, LVI in one type of cancer may be much less important than LVI in another type of cancer. Generally speaking, it is associated with lymph node metastases which themselves are predictive of a poorer prognosis. In the context of (histologically) proven lymph node metastases, LVI may have less prognostic significance or no prognostic significance. Breast cancer Whether LVI is a significant prognostic factor in breast cancer is widely debated, and there is no clear consensus. Urothelial carcinoma In urothelial carcinoma, LVI is an independent predictor of a poorer prognosis that has more predictive power than tumour stage.

Forge workers' cottages nearby date from the late 18th century, and include two small cottages on either side of a pair of two larger houses, for the higher status workmen.Newman, p.412 The nearby Osbaston Weir, associated with the forge, prevented salmon and other fish reaching their spawning grounds. It has been a Grade II listed building since 8 October 2005. In 1899, Monmouth Corporation established one of the first publicly owned electricity generating stations in the country at Osbaston. The power station used water power to drive turbines. The height of the weir was raised to impound a reservoir, and the water was directed by a leat to the turbines underneath the brick building, which housed three alternators.

Accessed 28 March 2012 In 1930, the power station was bought by part of the General Electric Company, and continued to operate for another twenty years.Alan Sutton Publishing, Monmouth and the River Wye in Old Photographs, Alan Sutton Publishing, 1989, , page 75 In 2008, the Environment Agency created a ¬£600,000 fish pass so that salmon could avoid the weir and spawn upstream. The following year migratory salmon were found above the fish pass, at Kentchurch. During the engineering work for the fish pass, remains of the old power station were uncovered. Landowner Ronald Kear proposed that the power station be rebuilt and, working in partnership with Environment Agency Wales, invested ¬£500,000 in the project. The electricity scheme uses an Archimedes' screw which powers a generator. It is now operated by the Old Manor Electric Company, and produces 670 MWh of electricity each year for the National Grid, which is sufficient to power over 150 homes. The combined hydroelectric and fish pass project was officially opened by Prince Edward in 2009.

She was a concubine of Emperor Zhenzong and the mother of Emperor Renzong. She was posthumously honored as Empress Dowager Zhangyi (Á´†ÊáøÁöáÂ§™Âêé), after Emperor Renzong discovered that she was his real mother. == Biography == Born in Hangzhou, the future Consort Li first became an imperial maid for Consort Liu. She caught the eye of Emperor Zhenzong and bore him a boy and a daughter (who died). The boy was claimed by Consort Liu who successfully became the empress. Even after the boy became Emperor Renzong, the real mother still kept her silence. In the 11th year of her son's reign (also overseen by Empress Liu), she became ill and was given the consort rank Chenfei shortly before she died. A year later, after Empress Liu also died, Prince Zhao Yuanyan told the emperor the truth, and also suggested that Consort Li had been murdered. Shocked with grief, Emperor Renzong visited the coffin with tears, ordered the construction of Jingling Palace for her memorial and gave her the posthumous title Empress Zhangyi. However, as Empress Liu had treated Consort Li's corpse with great respect, Emperor Renzong refused to believe that she would murder his biological mother. == Legend == A Yuan Dynasty play (in the form of zaju) called Chen Lin Carrying the Box at Gold Water Bridge (ÈáëÊ∞¥Ê©ãÈô≥Áê≥Êä±Â¶ùÁõí) told the story of how Consort Li and her baby son were victimized by a jealous Consort Liu. This story, which probably borrowed elements from the play The Orphan of Zhao that is more historically plausible, became incredibly popular and saw many different versions in later periods, including the Qing Dynasty novel The Seven Heroes and Five Gallants, where it is referred to as The Wild Cat for Crown Prince. In this later version, Consort Li was an equal of Consort Liu when she gave birth to Emperor Renzong. Consort Liu plotted with eunuch Guo Huai to secretly swap the infant with a skinned Chinese wild cat. Outraged by the \\"monster baby\\" and believing her cursed, Emperor Zhenzong demoted Consort Li to the forbidden palace. Meanwhile, Consort Liu ordered her maid Kou Zhu to murder the infant and dump the body, but Kou Zhu gave the infant to eunuch Chen Lin, who hid him in a box and carried him to emperor's brother Eighth Prince, who took his infant nephew in as one of his sons. Later, Consort Liu persuaded Emperor Zhenzong to have Consort Li killed. Eunuch Yu Zhong volunteered to die in her place, and with the help of another eunuch Qin Feng, Consort Li finally escaped from the palace. Several years later, as an old blind woman in a poor village, she found the opportunity to tell the story to the good official Bao Zheng. Finally the hidden secret was unearthed and the crown prince, now Emperor Renzong, eventually accepted his birth mother. == References == * Toqto'a et al., History of Song, vol. 242 (Consort Chenfei Li). * Toqto'a et al., History of Song, vol. 242 (Empress Zhangxianmingsu Liu).

Keith Dewar writes: \\"Heritage can be world heritage, regional heritage, or it can belong to a particular culture or simply to an extended family.

It was when the party split in two due to problems with slavery. Democratic Candidate Stephen A. Douglas was the nominee and lost to Republican Candidate Abraham Lincoln. They held two conventions before the election, in Charleston and Baltimore, where they established their platform. ==History== Sectional confrontations escalated during the 1850s, the Democratic Party split between North and South grew deeper. The conflict was papered over at the 1852 and 1856 conventions by selecting men who had little involvement in sectionalism, but they made matters worse. Historian Roy F. Nichols explains why Franklin Pierce was not up to the challenges a Democratic president had to face: :As a national political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, as he made up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had the letter of the law on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.Roy F. Nichols, \\"Franklin Pierce,\\" Dictionary of American Biography (1934) reprinted in In 1854, Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois‚Äîa key Democratic leader in the Senate‚Äîpushed the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act through Congress. President Franklin Pierce signed the bill into law in 1854.Robert R. Russel, \\"The Issues in the Congressional Struggle over he Kansas-Nebraska Bill, 1854.\\" Journal of Southern History 29.2 (1963): 187‚Äì210. The Act opened Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory to a decision by the residences on whether slavery would be legal or not. Previously it had been illegal there. Thus the new law implicitly repealed the prohibition on slavery in territory north of 36¬∞ 30‚Ä≤ latitude that had been part of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. Supporters and enemies of slavery poured into Kansas to vote slavery up or down. The armed conflict was Bleeding Kansas and it shook the nation. A major re-alignment took place among voters and politicians. The Whig Party fell apart and the new Republican Party was founded in opposition to the expansion of slavery and to the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act. The new party had little support in the South, but it soon became a majority in the North by pulling together former Whigs and former Free Soil Democrats.William E. Gienapp, The Origins of the Republican Party, 1852‚Äì1856 (1987) explores statistically the flow of voters between parties in the 1850s. During the Civil War, Northern Democrats divided into two factions: the War Democrats, who supported the military policies of President Lincoln; and the Copperheads, who strongly opposed them. No party politics were allowed in the Confederacy, whose political leadership, mindful of the welter prevalent in antebellum American politics and with a pressing need for unity, largely viewed political parties as inimical to good governance and as being especially unwise in wartime. Consequently, the Democratic Party halted all operations during the life of the Confederacy (1861‚Äì1865).Jennifer L. Weber, Copperheads: The Rise and Fall of Lincoln's Opponents in the North (2006) Partisanship flourished in the North and strengthened the Lincoln Administration as Republicans automatically rallied behind it. After the attack on Fort Sumter, Douglas rallied Northern Democrats behind the Union, but when Douglas died the party lacked an outstanding figure in the North and by 1862 an anti-war peace element was gaining strength. The most intense anti-war elements were the Copperheads. The Democratic Party did well in the 1862 congressional elections, but in 1864 it nominated General George McClellan (a War Democrat) on a peace platform and lost badly because many War Democrats bolted to National Union candidate Abraham Lincoln. Many former Democrats became Republicans, especially soldiers such as generals Ulysses S. Grant and John A. Logan.Jack Waugh, Reelecting Lincoln: The Battle for the 1864 Presidency (1998) ==Party platform== The Northern Democratic Party declared their support for the policies laid out at the 1856 Democratic convention in Cincinnati. They resolved not to change any of the policies but suggested the additions of resolutions in relation to the nature and extent of the powers of a Territorial Legislature, as well as the powers of Congress over slavery. * They resolved that the party will obey the decisions of the supreme court on the questions of constitutional law. * That the United States has a duty to provide protection to all citizens, at home and abroad, whether they are native or foreign. *That the Democratic party will insure the construction of a railroad to the Pacific coast as soon as possible, to facilitate fast communication between Atlantic and Pacific states, *That they support the acquisition of Cuba, as long as the terms are agreeably to the United States and Spain. *That the attempts to defeat the execution of the Fugitive Slave Law, are hostile, undermine the Constitution, and revolutionary in their effect. *That while Territorial Governments are in existence, the measure of restriction imposed by the Federal Constitution on the power of the Territorial Legislature over the subject of the domestic relations shall be respected and enforced by every branch of the General Government. ==Copperheads== In the 1860s, the Copperheads, also known as Peace Democrats, were a faction of Democrats in the Union who opposed the American Civil War and wanted an immediate peace settlement with the Confederates. ==War Democrats== War Democrats in American politics of the 1860s were members of the Democratic Party who supported the Union and rejected the policies of the Copperheads (or Peace Democrats). The War Democrats demanded a more aggressive policy toward the Confederacy and supported the policies of Republican President Abraham Lincoln, when the American Civil War broke out a few months after his victory in the 1860 presidential election.Jean H.

The name \\"Boombotix\\" is a fictitious term derived from the science of sound. The term merges robotics and boombox. The products consist or audio focused wearable technology with a line of devices called Boombots. Boombotix's products are targeted to urban and outdoor sports demographics (namely cyclists, skateboarders, skiers, and surfers) and the general consumer electronics market. The products are commonly used by bike messengers and commuters as a handsfree communications device. Boombotix products are sold through major retailers including Verizon, Radio Shack, Urban Outfitters, Zumiez, specialty retailers, bike shops and their online store. ==Company history== Lief Storer founded Boombotix (originally under the name SkullyBoom), in 2009. The first Boombotix product, named the SB1, was inspired by the Skully vinyl toy, manufactured at the time by Urban Warfair. By splitting the vinyl down the middle, and adding a dissected iHome audio speaker and Motorola radio clip, Lief was able to create a wearable speaker. The original prototype product went viral in the online community, with TechCrunch touting it as an \\"uncrushable music device\\". The SB1 combined a powerful driver in an ultra portable, drop tested and water resistant package. In 2010, the first product was sold at Ken's Bike and Ski in Davis, CA. In 2013 the company launched the Boombot REX designed by Chris McKleroy. https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/04/boombot-rex-a-durable-affordable-bluetooth- speaker-for-the-adventurous-crowd-hits-kickstarter/ This new device became amongst the first voice controlled speakers. It incorporated dual drivers and a passive bass radiator making it one of the loudest portable speakers for its size. The company raised four times of their target goal with their Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign. BoombotREX Exploded Blue In early 2015, RZA joined the Boombotix as the company's \\"Head Abbot.\\" RZA's role would be focused on connecting Boombotix to more musicians and help marketing the product.http://www.fastcompany.com/3046741/why-did-wu-tangs-rza-just-join- this-bluetooth-speaker-company In summer of 2015 Boombotix launched two new speaker products: the Boombot PRO and the Boombot MINI. The Boombot PRO is the company's first waterproof speaker. In Q4 of 2016, the company was supposed to undergo a change in management, yet none of the effect have been observed. Warrantied speakers, all orders from the end of 2016, and any sort of technical support are all nonexistent. Company may have filed for bankruptcy. The company has been unable to respond to consumer issues and complaints, garnering an F with the BBB and many negative reviews on yelp at their defunct San Francisco location. ==Product Reception== By the end of 2013, Boombotix had already sold over sixty thousand Boombot units. Boombotix products received a fair amount of press and reviews for their portable speaker product, from the action sports and consumer electronics sectors alike. Boombotix has targeted the cycling community with a handlebar mount kit to clip the speaker on, which has garnered Boombotix a strong following in the urban cycling community. ==Headquarters== Boombotixhttp://www.boombotix.com/ is headquartered in San Francisco but mostly operates out of Delaware now. ==Investors== In 2014, the company received a $4 million investment from key players including David Dolby, Walden Venture Capital, Social+Capital Partnership, Baseline, Red Hills and Grishin Robotics.https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/01/boombotix-raises-4m-for-its- wearable-action-speakers-and-audio-sync-software/ Sponsored Athletes Boombotix is known for being rooted in action sports, sponsoring professional athletes in cycling, skateboarding, skiing, and surfing.

Promotions with Artists In 2014 Boombotix partnered with RZA to release a co-branded Wu-Tang Clan unit. The unit is unique in that it contains 8 tracks from the 20th Anniversary Wu-Tang Album, \\"A Better Tomorrow.\\" The unit was released three weeks prior to the general release of the album.

Located at 15 Washington Street on Washington Park it was once headquarters for the American Insurance Company and is now part of Rutgers University. The neo-classical tower is a contributing property to the James Street Commons Historic District which also encompasses Washington Park, Newark Museum, and Newark Public Library. It re-opened in November 2015 as student dorms, event space, and chancellor's apartment. ==American Insurance Company== Newark has been a center for the insurance industry since the early 19th century and has been home to Firemen's Insurance Company and Mutual Benefit Life. The Prudential Insurance headquarters are prominent buildings within the Four Corners Historic District. The American Insurance Company was incorporated February 20, 1846, and commenced business on April 1, 1846. The company maintained offices downtown on Broad Street and later Park Place. A new home office was completed in 1930. The sixteen story neo-classical tower is tall. A main interior feature is a \\"great hall\\" with ceilings and windows. The building was designed by the father and son architectural firm, John H. & Wilson C. Ely, which also designed the National Newark Building and Newark City Hall. The American Insurance Company later became the American Insurance Group. The company was acquired by the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company in 1963 the combined company for a time known as the Fireman's Fund American Insurance Group. ==Rutgers University== SI Newhouse Center for Law and Justice In 1977 the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company announced it would be moving its corporate headquarters from downtown Newark to a new campus in suburban Morris Plains, N.J. The company donated its soon to be vacated building to Rutgers University. After outgrowing facilities in several buildings in downtown the Rutgers School of Law in Newark consolidated into the skyscraper located near the main campus. It was named it in honor of Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr., a 1916 graduate of the New Jersey Law School (a forerunner of the law school) and founder of Advance Publications and housed the SI Newhouse Center for Law and Justice from 1979 to 1999. after which time the building remained empty. Graduate school housing Rutgers originally intended to develop the building as a hotel, but the project fell through after September 11, 2001. In February 2012, the university announced that it planned to renovate the vacant structure for graduate student housing, citing the growing need and prime location near the campus and the Newark Broad Street Station. The project calls for a conversion into a mixed-use complex with furnished studio apartments and one- to four-bedroom units for 350 students. It is expected to cost $71 million and be a catalyst for continued renaissance of downtown as a residential as well as commercial community. The project is financed through grants, tax credits, and bond issues. Renovations are expected to begin in 2014 and completed in 2015. and will include public performance spaces and a penthouse for the school's chancellor. ==See also== *List of tallest buildings in Newark *Washington Park (NLR station) *One Riverview == References  External links == * The American Insurance Co. v.

Reverting to Scottish control, King Edward I of England captured the castle in 1298, 1300 and 1303. Besieged in 1306 and 1309 by Scottish forces, it withheld the sieges. It was captured in 1309 by Scottish forces and then by English forces in 1311.

Her birth name was Val Henson, but she changed it shortly before 2009, choosing her middle name after the computer scientist Anita Borg. In 2012, Aurora, and Ada Initiative co-founder Mary Gardiner, were named two of the most influential people in computer security by SC Magazine. In 2013, she won the O'Reilly Open Source Award. == Early life and education == Aurora was raised in New Mexico, and was home-schooled. She became involved in computer programming when she attended DEF CON in 1995. She studied computer science and mathematics at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. == Programming == She first became involved with file systems when she worked with ZFS in 2002 at Sun Microsystems. She later moved to IBM where she worked in the group of Theodore Ts'o, where they considered extensions to the ext2 and ext3 Linux file systems. While working at Intel, she implemented the ext2 dirty bitThis feature lets the user to skip file system checks after a crash (for example after a power fail), but only if the file system was idle at the time of crash. and relative atime. Along with Arjan van de Ven, she came up with the idea for ChunkFS, which simplifies file system checks by dividing the file system into independent pieces. She also co-organized the first Linux File Systems Workshop in order to figure out how to spread awareness of and raise funding for file system development. As of 2009, she worked for Red Hat as a file systems developer as well as a part- time science writer and Linux consultant. == Ada Initiative == Already an activist for women in open source, she joined Mary Gardiner and members of the Geek Feminism blog to develop anti-harassment policies for conferences after Noirin Shirley was sexually assaulted at ApacheCon 2010. Aurora quit her job as a Linux kernel developer at Red Hat and, with Gardiner, founded the Ada Initiative in February 2011. The organization was named after Ada Lovelace, who worked with Charles Babbage and is considered to be the world's first computer programmer. Two years later, Aurora founded Double Union, a hackerspace for women, with Amelia Greenhall and Liz Henry, but was banned in 2018. The Ada Initiative was shut down in October 2015. == Writing == Maintaining a blog since 2007, Aurora has written extensively about coding and the experiences of women in open source. This has included descriptions of DEF CON and the harassment that took place there. In 2013, Aurora provided a comment to The Verge about the Electronic Frontier Foundation's involvement in the legal defense of Andrew Auernheimer, who was in prison for hacking and had previously harassed Kathy Sierra. Aurora said \\"This is another case where they're saying, 'The cases we care about are the ones white men are interested in. We‚Äôre less interested in protecting women on the web.'\\" This comment was received negatively by the EFF's Director of International Freedom of Expression, Jillian York. Another 2013 controversy that received commentary from Aurora was Donglegate in which PyCon attendee Adria Richards faced backlash for reporting a conversation overheard between two men sitting near her. Aurora condemned the threats sent to Richards and stated that Anonymous, by using large numbers of computers, was \\"distorting social pressure\\". When asked if firing one of the males was an appropriate response, she said \\"I don't have enough information to know that.\\" Two years later, Aurora praised the gender ratio at PyCon and called Guido van Rossum and the Python community \\"the biggest success story for women in open source.\\" In the same interview, she approved of the culture of the website Tumblr and stated that Linus Torvalds' daughter Patricia was a positive role-model. == See also == * AdaCamp == References  Further reading == * * == External links == * * Valerie Aurora on File Systems and the Ada Initiative: An Interview Category:American feminists Category:Free software programmers Category:IBM employees Category:Red Hat employees Category:Intel people Category:Linux people Category:Living people Category:New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology alumni Category:People from New Mexico Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Sex-positive feminists Category:Sun Microsystems people Category:Women founders Category:21st-century American women scientists Category:21st-century American scientists Category:American women's rights activists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Valerie Aurora"},{"id":"35244945","text":"The Singles 1971‚Äì2006 is a box set compilation of singles by The Rolling Stones spanning the years 1971 to 2006.

Saylor Trail is a predominantly flat double-loop trail located on the edge of the Allegheny Plateau, southeast of the town of Windber in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. This trail is named after Congressman John P. Saylor, who represented Pennsylvania from 1949 to 1973. He was a conservationist with a deep concern for the environment. While in Congress, Saylor sponsored the National Scenic Trails Act and supported national wilderness preservation. The northern loop of the John P. Saylor Trail is approximately in length and the southern loop is about long. The entire trail is a little over long and can be hiked in a single day, but more typically done in two days. There is a shelter erected on the southern loop that permits camping for an overnight backpack trip. In the spring the trail is very wet with many springs and streams leading to marshy areas. On parts of the trail there is well preserved evidence of the former railroad grades. The trail crosses Clear Shade Creek by a narrow suspension bridge into the Clear Shade Wild Area, where the southern Middle Ridge Loop is located. ==Marking== As with most long distance trails in Pennsylvania, the John P. Saylor Trail is blazed with orange. Side and connecting trails, such as the Bog and Boulder Trail or the Fisherman's Path, are blazed yellow. Cross-country skiing trails are blazed blue. ==Trailheads== The entry point for the trail is in Gallitzin State Forest, at the Babcock Picnic Area on Pennsylvania Route 56. During winter months the picnic area is closed and trail head parking can be found along Route 56 a short distance from the entrance to the picnic area. Located within the picnic area is a signboard indicating the start of the trail. From here the hiker can go either left or right on the John P. Saylor Trail, traveling in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction, and eventually return to this spot if the entire loop is completed. An optional parking area is located at the northern end of Shade Road, just off route PA56. Shade Road is closed from the middle of December until mid-March but this parking area is located adjacent to the gated road and accessible year round. ==Points of interest== There are no vistas on this trail but there are various points of interest to be observed. These include the scenic but heavily vandalized Wolf Rocks, bog viewing from an elevated platform on the Bog and Boulder Trail, remnants of a splash dam from the logging era, large meadows formed by beaver activity, the swinging suspension bridge over Clear Shade Creek, and the Adirondack shelter. ==External links== *Pennsylvania DCNR website about the John P.

In the early 21st century, most Jews in France, like most Muslims in France, are of North African origin. France has the largest population of Jews in the diaspora after the United States‚Äîan estimated 500,000‚Äì600,000 persons. Paris has the highest population, followed by Marseilles, which has 70,000 Jews, most of North African origin. Expressions of anti-semitism were seen to rise during the Six-Day War of 1967 and the French anti-Zionist campaign of the 1970s and 1980s.Emmanuel Navon, \\"France, Israel, and the Jews: The End of an Era?\\", Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs, 2015, https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23739770.2015.1042277\\"Le Surmoi antis√©mite de la T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise\\", Times of Israel Following the electoral successes achieved by the extreme right-wing National Front and an increasing denial of the Holocaust among some persons in the 1990s, surveys showed an increase in stereotypical antisemitic beliefs among the general French population., US Holocaust Museum\\"Holocaust denial/legal concepts in Europe\\" , Democratic Unionhttps://mondediplo.com/1998/05/08igou At the beginning of the 21st century, antisemitism in France rose sharply during the unrest of the Second Intifada in Israel and the Palestinian territories, as it did in other European nations. In addition, a significant proportion of the second- generation Muslim immigrant population in France began to identify with the Palestinian cause, with some also identifying with radical Islamism.\\"A Frenchman Or a Jew?\\" By Fernanda Eberstadt, New York Times Magazine, February 29, 2004Daniella Peled, \\"French hatred of Jews goes far beyond Muslim antisemitism, says U.K. author\\", Haaretz, 18 February 2014 In the early 2000s, a critical debate on the nature of antisemitism in France accompanied denunciation of it in relation to the situation in the Middle East and to Islam. Divisions developed among anti-racist groups.\\"Alarmed by antisemitism, French Jews consider flight\\", Deutsche Welt, 17 March 2014 Alarmed by violence and verbal attacks, some French Jews began to emigrate to Israel. By early 2014 the number of French Jews making aliyah (emigrating to Israel) surpassed the number of American Jews who were emigrating. At the same time 70 percent of French Jews reported in surveys that they were concerned about insults or harassment and 60% about physical aggression because of their ethnicity; both figures are much higher than shown in surveys of the European average. ==Background== At the turn of the 21st century, France had an estimated 500,000 to 600,000 Jews, most of them Sephardic and of North African origin. This is the second-largest population outside of Israel, and after that in the United States. A quarter of the historic Ashkenazi Jewish population in France died in the Holocaust of World War II. After the war, the French government passed laws to suppress antisemitic discrimination and actions, and to protect Jews in the country. In the 1950s and 1960s, many Sephardic Jews emigrated to France from countries such as Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, which had gained independence from colonial rule through extended warfare against France. The wars for independence left both sides with considerable bitterness, and Algeria was immersed in civil war for years after gaining independence. Jews left North Africa as relations in the area became more strained during the Six-Day War of 1967 between Israel, Egypt and other Arab forces. This increased tensions across the Arab world. The rise of the Second Intifada, beginning in 2000, contributed to rising tensions with Arab Muslims and Jews feeling less welcome in North African nations. Most have now left the region. Beginning in the late 20th century, more Arabs from North African nations began to emigrate to France for economic reasons and to escape civil wars in their home nations. Historically numerous North African Arabs had lived and worked in France since before World War II. The Muslim community built the Grand Mosque in Paris in 1929. Its Imam (Si Kaddour Benghabrit) and numerous members helped protect Jews from deportation during the Holocaust.\\"The Holocaust 's Arab Heroes\\", The Washington Post, October 8, 2006, Robert Satloff In the mid-1990s historians renewed a critical study of National Socialism, collaboration, and the responsibility of the Vichy Regime for deportation of Jews during the Holocaust. They contested the book Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order, 1940-1944 (1972) (published in French as La France de Vichy) by American historian Robert Paxton, who had said the Vichy Regime cooperated with Nazi Germany. British historian Maud S. Mandel bases her inquiry Jews and Muslims in France: A History of a Conflict (2014) on historic relations among the peoples of North Africa. She attributes the roots of Muslim antisemitism among second-generation immigrants in France to earlier inter-communal relations among the peoples in Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco; the course of decolonization in North Africa; and events in the continuing Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. Sociologists such as Nonna Mayer, Laurent Mucchielli and others have said that anti-semitic opinions have been in decline in France since the end of the Second World War, and that other forms of racism have been more widespread than antisemitism. Members of the French Jewish community criticized this conclusion. France has struggled to help Arab working-class youth find work, as their unemployment rate is high. In their isolated public housing communities outside Paris, anti-semitic sentiment is prevalent. In 2016 Paris has the largest population of Jews in France, followed by Marseilles, which has 70,000. Many working-class Arabs and Sephardic Jews also settled in cities in southern France, which had long been linked by trade and culture to North Africa. In many of these communities, such as Nice and Marseilles, Arab and Jewish immigrants from North African nations have lived in mixed communities as they began to make new lives in France. Both Jews and Muslims are minorities in France. Many North African Jews worked with Arab immigrants to combat racism in France against the latter group, and support other progressive causes. French concerns about antisemitism among second- generation Arab groups is also related to general concerns about Islamic terrorism in the country. In 2015 Paris suffered two major Islamic attacks, which were generally targeted at all French people. In addition, from the end of 2015 into early 2016, there were independent attacks against individual Jews in several cities, including three in Marseilles from October to January. In 2017 it was reported that \\"A former principal at a preparatory school for teenagers...said he regularly advised Jews not to attend his institution for fear of harassment by other students\\" and that only a third of Jews attend public schools. ==Antisemitic acts== The National Consultative Commission on Human Rights (Commission nationale consultative des droits de l'homme, CNCDH) has issued annual reports on antisemitic activities as part of the French oversight of human rights. It recorded disturbing levels of antisemitic actions and threats in France between 2002‚Äì2004 (the height of the Second Intifada), and in 2009. According to CNCDH, it defined actions to be tracked as homicides, attacks and attempted attacks, arson, degradations, and violence and assault and battery. Antisemitic threats are defined as covering speech acts, threatening gestures and insults, graffiti (inscriptions), pamphlets and emails. Its data was relied on in the FRA (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights) report of anti-semitism incidents in France from 2001‚Äì2011, which was issued in June 2012. {  style=\\"text- align:center; margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\\" - ! !!

Analysts related it to the Second Intifada in Israel and the Palestinian territories. On January 21, 2006, Ilan Halimi, a young French Jewish man of Moroccan descent was kidnapped by a group called the Gang of Barbarians, led by Youssouf Fofana. Halimi was subsequently tortured over a period of three weeks, resulting in his death.Tale of Torture and Murder Horrifies the Whole of France, Michel Gurfinkiel, The New York Sun, February 22, 2006. From March 11 to 19, 2012, Mohammed Merah, a French man of Algerian descent born in Toulouse, committed the Toulouse and Montauban shootings, a series of three attacks against French soldiers and civilians in Toulouse and Montauban, in the Midi-Pyr√©nees region. The last day he attacked a Jewish day school in Toulouse, killing a teacher and three children, and wounding a teenager. He killed a total of three French Muslim soldiers in Toulouse and Montauban, and seriously wounded a fourth. During the 30-hour police siege at his apartment on March 22, Merah wounded three police men before he was killed by a police sniper. 2015 to present Attacks on Jews had a record high in 2015, the numbers fell 58% in 2016 and fell a further 7% in 2017. In 2018, the first nine months of the year saw a 69% rise in attacks. Despite only representing 1% of the population in France, Jews are targeted by 40% of racially or religiously motivated violent acts. Increases in violent attacks on Jews in France since 2015 are thought to put \\"the very existence of Jewish communities\\" in France in doubt. During the January 2015 √éle-de-France attacks, the Porte de Vincennes siege involved a gunman taking hostages at a Kosher supermarket. In the aftermath of the attacks, the French government increased the presence of soldiers outside prominent Jewish buildings. In the February 2015 Nice stabbing attack soldiers guarding a Jewish community center in Nice were attacked by an Islamist supporter of ISIL wielding a knife. On 24 October 2015, 3 Jewish men outside a synagogue in Marseille were stabbed by a man shouting anti-Jewish slogans. One of the victims sustained serious abdominal wounds; he was expected to survive. The assailant was apprehended. On 18 November 2015 a teacher in Marseille walking on the street was stabbed by three men who shouted anti-Jewish slogans; one of the men wore an ISIS T-shirt. The three men, riding two scooters, had approached the teacher and stabbed him in the arm and in the leg. They fled when a car approached. On January 12, 2016 Benjamin Amsellem, a teacher, was attacked by a teenage boy wielding a machete outside a Jewish school in Marseille. The attacker claimed to be acting in the name of ISIS. Amsellem resisted by parrying some of the machete blows with the large, leather-bound Bible he was carrying. The attacker was a Kurdish Muslim whose family emigrated to France from Turkey. An excellent student from a stable, pious home, he is said by French authorities to have self-radicalized by spending long hours reading Islamist websites. On August 18, 2016, a \\"confirmed anti-semite\\" shouted \\"allahu akbar\\" (Takbir), as he attacked a 62-year-old Jew wearing a kippa on avenue des Vosges in Strasbourg. The attacker had previously stabbed another Jew in 2010 in Kl√©ber square. The French Minister of the Interior, Bernard Cazeneuve, called the rabbi of Strasbourg to express his \\"solidarity.\\" The attacker was said to have mental problems.https://pjmedia.com/homeland-security/2016/08/19/known-wolf- alert-man-who-stabbed-rabbi-in-strasbourg-shouting-allahu-akhbar-involved-in- prior-stabbing/ The attacker was charged the following day with \\"attempted murder based on the victim's appearance belonging to a race or religion.\\" On April 4, 2017, retired kindergarten professor, Dr. Sarah Halimi, an Orthodox Jew, was murdered and subsequently thrown off her Paris balcony by Mali-born Kobili Traor√©, who shouted \\"allahu akbar\\" as he beat her to death. The murder sparked a public conversation in France about the failure of the press to report on and the failure of the government to act on violent antisemitism in France. In March 2018, an elderly woman, Mireille Knoll, was brutally murdered in her apartment in a subsidized housing project in Paris in a killing that was immediately declared and officially recognized as an act of Jew hatred. On 16 February 2019, a group of individuals involved in a yellow-vests march confronted 69-year-old Jewish philosopher and academic Alain Finkielkraut with verbal anti-semitic abuse. Police stepped in to protect him, and Macron later said that this behaviour was an \\"absolute negation\\" of what made France great and would not be tolerated. Statistics published in February 2019 showed a rise of 74% in the number of anti-Semitic attacks in the previous year, from 311 (2017) to 541 (2018). In late 2018 and early 2019, a number of attacks occurred, such as the defacing of portraits of the late Holocaust survivor and French minister Simone Veil, scrawling the German word for \\"Jews\\" on a Parisian bakery and cutting down a tree planted in memory of a Jewish youth tortured and murdered by an anti-Semitic gang. In February 2019, nearly 100 graves were desecrated with Nazi symbols the Quatzenheim Jewish cemetery in the Alsace region of eastern France. President Emmanuel Macron visited the site to show solidarity with the whole of France, vowing that the perpetrators would be punished using current laws. Concerns have been raised in France about whether the gilets jaunes movement is providing a new kind of forum for extremist views, since Alain Finkielkraut was verbally abused on 16 February 2019. Vincent Duclert, a specialist in French anti-Semitism, said that \\"the gilets jaunes are not an anti-Semitic movement, but alongside the demonstration each Saturday there's a lot of anti-Semitic expression by groups of the extreme right or extreme left.\\" Jean-Yves Camus, expert in French political extremism, talked of \\"a new space for different kinds of anti- Semitism to come together: from the extreme right and extreme left, but also from radical Islamist or anti-Zionist groups, and some types of social conservatives\\". Politicians expressed different views of how or why anti- Semitic influences may be infiltrating the movement and the rise of anti- Semitism in France in the past couple of years. Public opinion surveys A number of surveys have been conducted of French people's attitudes toward Jews since the turn of the 21st century. Responses appeared to relate to events in the world, especially the rise in Arab-Israeli tensions in Israel and the Palestinian territories during the Second Intifada, which started in 2000. Anti-semitic views have also become associated with opposition to globalisation and, in some cases, to actions by the United States and Israel in the Mid-East. According to the collection of two Anti-Defamation League (ADL) opinion surveys conducted in five European nations (which included France, The United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, and Belgium) in June 2002, and five additional European nations in October 2002, 42% of respondents in France believed that Jews were more loyal to Israel than their own country, 42% said Jews have too much power in the business world, and 46% believed Jews talked too much about the Holocaust. Abraham H. Foxman, ADL National Director, said, \\"These findings are especially disturbing because they show that the old, classical form of antisemitism, which we had hoped was long gone in Europe, continues to be resilient\\". In 2004, ADL conducted the same opinion survey in ten European nations, including France . The report said that 25% of the residents of the ten nations held antisemitic attitudes, down from 35% in five nations in 2002. 28% responded \\"probably true\\" to the statement, \\"Jews are more loyal to Israel than their own country\\", down from 42% in 2002. 15% responded \\"probably true\\" to the statement, \\"Jews don't care about anyone but their own kind\\", down from 20%. In May 2005, the ADL published an opinion survey conducted in 12 European countries regarding popular attitudes toward Jews. The 2005 survey indicated that since 2004 and the survey of 10 nations, there was some decline in the acceptance of certain traditional antisemitic stereotypes. 25% responded \\"probably true\\" to the statement, \\"Jews have too much power in the business world\\", down from 33% in 2004, while 24% responded \\"probably true\\" to the statement \\"Jews have too much power in international financial markets,\\" down from 29% in 2004. Two years later, in May 2007, the ADL published another opinion survey conducted in five European nations. It found that 22% of respondents answered \\"probably true\\" to at least three of the four antisemitic stereotypes tested: Jews are more loyal to Israel than to this country, Jews have too much power in the business world, Jews have too much power in international financial markets, Jews still talk too much about what happened to them in the Holocaust. According to the survey, respondents believed that violence directed against French Jews was based more on anti- Jewish feelings than anti-Israel sentiment. The Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES) organization published a report in 2011, Intolerance, Prejudice and Discrimination: A European Report. It concluded that anti-Semitic attitudes in France that same year, as a whole, were less widespread than the European average. According to a survey conducted by FES, 27.7% agreed with the statement \\"Jews have too much influence in France\\" and 25.8% agreed with the statement \\"Jews in general do not care about anything or anyone but their own kind\\" (implying disloyalty to the nation). In 2012, the ADL conducted another opinion survey of antisemitic attitudes in 10 European countries. It reported that the overall level of antisemitism in France had increased to 24% of the population, up from to 20% in 2009. In terms of specific statements, 45% responded \\"probably true\\" related to \\"Jews are more loyal to Israel\\" than their own country, up from 38% in 2009. 35% responded \\"probably true\\" to the statement, \\"Jews have too much power in the business world\\", up from 33% in 2009. 29% responded \\"probably true\\" to the statement \\"Jews have too much power in international financial markets\\", up from 27% in 2009. Foxman, ADL National Director, has said regarding those findings: > In France, you have a volatile mix. France has seen an increase in the level > of anti-Semitism. At the same time, more people today believe that violence > directed against European Jews is fueled by anti-Jewish attitudes as opposed > to anti-Israel sentiment. Those increases are all the more disturbing in > light of the [2012] shooting attack at the Jewish school in Toulouse. ==Responses to antisemitism== The French Jewish establishment has traditionally worked with the government and various community groups on legal routes and education to combat and reduce anti-semitism. CRIF, an umbrella body of French Jewish communities, has used outreach and education to lessen tensions among various ethnic groups and to combat anti-semitism. The authorities are prosecuting persons both for violent acts and for violating laws related to Holocaust denial and reducing anti-semitism. In several instances, the national or local governments have increased police protection around Jewish sites or Jewish neighborhoods in an effort to prevent attacks.. The level of violence in French society related to anti-semitism has been complicated by actions of the Ligue de D√©fense Juive (LDJ, French Jewish Defense League), which registered in 2001. With about 300 members in 2013, the LDJ was condemned by the French Jewish establishment, which threatens court action against it. Its relations have been strained with CRIF, the umbrella body of French Jewish communities. A selection of other responses to anti- semitism follows: *On 20 February 2019, President Macron said that France would recognise anti-Zionism as a form of anti-Semitism. He also said that the government would ban three extreme-right groups which incited hatred: Bastion Social, Blood and Honour Hexagone and Combat 18. *On 20 February 2019, after a series of high-profile anti-semitic attacks and just hours after the desecration of Jewish graves, thousands of demonstrators marched in Paris under the slogan \\"#√áaSuffit\\" (that's enough). Political figures including former Presidents Fran√ßois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy joined the march, after it was called for by Olivier Faure, first secretary of the Socialist Party and organised with the endorsement of more than 50 political parties, unions and associations. Demonstrations were also reported in 60 cities including Marseille, Bordeaux and Nantes. *On 19 February 2019, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said that the government was looking at new legislation to tackle hate speech on social media. * In December 2014, the Organization of Jewish Europeans (OJE) started using humor against French antisemitism. It distributed boxes of 'Antisemitox:' the first treatment against antisemitism. They contain three sweets, several detox patches, and the text of the law stating the penalties faced by those who express antisemitic views. * In October 2013, the French Bar Association disbarred Alexis Dubruel, a lawyer from eastern France, after he filed a motion to disqualify judge Albert Levy, because of Jewish ancestry, from presiding over a custody case. In another case, a Paris court sentenced a blogger convicted of posting material inciting discrimination and violence against Jews to eight months in prison and a $670 fine. It ordered him to pay $2,000 in damages to people he targeted. * In November 2007, teacher Vincent Reynouard, who had already been dismissed and convicted, was sentenced to one year imprisonment and a fine of 10,000 euros for denying the Holocaust. * On 26 October 2007, Kemi Seba, founder of the banned Tribu KA, was sentenced in Paris to five months in prison, a fine of 10,000 euros, and the forfeiting of his civic rights for five years, for inciting racial hatred and denying crimes against humanity. * On 21 March 2006, the Commission nationale consultative des droits de lhomme (CNCDH) recommended additional measures to the government to fight antisemitism. * On 10 March 2006, a Paris court fined the comedian Dieudonn√© M'Bala M'Bala 5,000 euro for antisemitic comments. * In November 2006, a Lyon court fined Bruno Gollnisch, second in command of the FN, 10,000 euro for questioning the existence of the Holocaust. * On 15 January 2006, a French court fined Yahoo $15 million for selling Nazi memorabilia. * In November 2005, the Foundation for Shoah Remembrance distributed copies of a DVD about the Holocaust to 28,000 high school students, teachers and libraries in the Paris area. * On 13 June 2005, Judge Emmanuel Binoche ruled that Internet service providers must filter access to the AAARGH (Association of Veteran Fans of Stories of War and Holocausts), which disseminates Holocaust denial. * On 10 February 2005, the French Broadcasting Authority ordered the French satellite provider Eutelsat to stop transmitting broadcasts from the Iranian satellite TV channel Sahar 1, following screening of antisemitic content. * On 13 December 2004, the Council of State banned Hizballah's al-Manar transmissions on the grounds that some of its programs were antisemitic. * In July 2004, the Minister for Social Affairs asked the secretary general of the High Council for Integration, to evaluate government policy on the subject of combating antisemitism and to submit proposals. * In June 2003, an appeals court in Lyon upheld editor Jean Plantin's 6-month prison sentence, for publishing works doubting the scope of the Holocaust. * In March 2003, a conference of Catholics and Jews took place in Paris to discuss antisemitism in Europe and the place of religion in the proposed EU constitution. * In 2003, 19 people were arrested and 5 search warrants were issued against non-identified individuals, in connection with antisemitic offenses. * On 12 April 2003, three students, one French, one Dutch and one Tunisian, were arrested for incitement to racial hatred and antisemitism. * In August 2002, the government outlawed the rightist group Radical Unity. * In February 2002, French Minister of Education Jack Lang set up a commission to examine Holocaust denial at the University of Lyon III. * In 2001, the French anti-racism group, Action internationale pour la justice (AIPJ, another name for J‚ÄôAccuse) sought a court injunction to block a Nazi US web portal Front 14, which groups some 400 racist websites. * In 2000, the split in the FN resulted in reduced activity by the main anti-fascist organizations. * In 2000, LICRA (Ligue internationale contre le racisme et l‚Äôantis√©mitisme) focused mainly on combating hate on the Internet and has set up branches abroad. ==See also== * 2014 Sarcelles riots * Antisemitism in contemporary Austria * Antisemitism in contemporary Hungary * Antisemitism in contemporary Belgium ==References * The Lure of Anti- Semitism - Hatred of Jews in Present-Day France * Country Reports, The Stephen Ruth Institute for The Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism * Antisemitism - Summary overview of the situation in the European Union 2001‚Äì2011, FRA Category:21st century in France France France fr:Antis√©mitisme en France#Actuellement ","title":"Antisemitism in 21st-century France"},{"id":"35245009","text":"According to Paul Muchinsky in his textbook Psychology Applied to Work, \\"mechanical aptitude tests require a person to recognize which mechanical principle is suggested by a test item.\\" The underlying concepts measured by these items include sounds and heat conduction, velocity, gravity, and force. A number of tests of mechanical comprehension and mechanical aptitude have been developed and are predictive of performance in manufacturing/production and technical type jobs, for instance. == Background information == Military information Aptitude tests have been used for military purposes since World War I to screen recruits for military service. The Army Alpha and Army Beta tests were developed in 1917-1918 so ability of personnel could be measured by commanders. The Army Alpha was a test that assessed verbal ability, numerical ability, ability to follow directions, and general knowledge of specific information. The Army Beta was its non-verbal counterpart used to evaluate the aptitude of illiterate, unschooled, or non- English speaking draftees or volunteers. During World War II, the Army Alpha and Beta tests were replaced by The Army General Classification Test (AGCT) and Navy General Classification Test (NGCT). The AGCT was described as a test of general learning ability, and was used by the Army and Marine Corps to assign recruits to military jobs. About 12 million recruits were tested using the AGCT during World War II, the NGCT was used by the Navy to assign recruits to military jobs sailors were tested using the NGCT during World War II. Additional classification tests were developed early in World War II to supplement the AGCT and the NGCT. These included: *Specialized aptitude tests related to the technical fields (mechanical, electrical, and later, electronics) *Clerical and administrative tests, radio code operational tests *Language tests and driver selection tests.  Mechanical aptitude and spatial relations Mechanical aptitude tests are often coupled together with spatial relations tests. Mechanical aptitude is a complex function and is the sum of several different capacities, one of which is the ability to perceive spatial relations. Some research has shown that spatial ability is the most important part of mechanical aptitude for certain jobs. Because of this, spatial relations tests are often given separately, or in part with mechanical aptitude tests.  Gender differences There is no evidence that states there is a general intelligence difference between men and women. However, there is a difference in the cognitive abilities between the two sexes. Males tend to do better on quantitative tasks and visual-spatial skills than females, and females tend to score much higher than men on verbal sections of tests. In recent years, another mechanical aptitude test was created. The main purpose of this test was to create a fair chance for women to perform higher than or at the same level as men. Males still perform at a much higher level than women, but the scores between men and women have been drawn closer together. There is little research that has been devoted to why men are able to complete the tests and perform much higher than women. However studies have found that those with lower spatial ability usually do worse on mechanical reasoning, and this might be tied to women's lower performance in mechanical tasks. Studies have also found that pre-natal androgens such as testosterone positively affect performance in both spatial and mechanical abilities. == Uses == Sample question from a Mechanical Aptitude test The major uses for mechanical aptitude testing are: * Identify candidates with good spatial perception and mechanical reasoning ability * Assess a candidate's working knowledge of basic mechanical operations and physical laws * Recognize an aptitude for learning mechanical processes and tasks * Predict employee success and appropriately align your workforce These tests are used mostly for industries involving: * Manufacturing/Production * Energy/Utilities The major occupations that these tests are relevant to are: * Automotive and Aircraft Mechanics * Engineers * Installation/Maintenance/Repairpersons * Industrial/Technical (Non-Retail) Sales Representatives * Skilled Tradesperson such as Electricians, Welders, and Carpenters * Transportation Trades/Equipment Operators such as Truck driver and Heavy Equipment Operator == Types of tests ==  US Department of Defense Test of Mechanical Aptitude  The mechanical comprehension subtest of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), is one of the most widely used mechanical aptitude tests in the world. The test consists of ten subject-specific tests that measure your knowledge of and ability to perform in different areas, and provides an indication of your level of academic ability. The military would ask that all recruits take this exam to help them be placed in the correct job while enrolled in the military. In the beginning, World War I, the U.S. Army developed the Army Alpha and Beta Tests, which grouped the draftees and recruits for military service. The Army Alpha test measured recruits' knowledge, verbal and numerical ability, and ability to follow directions using 212 multiple-choice questions. However, during World War II, the U.S. Army replaced the tests with a newer and improved one called the Army General Classification Test. The test had many different versions until they improved it enough to be used regularly. The current tests consist of three different versions, two of which are on paper and pencil and the other is taken on the computer. The scores from each different version are linked together, so each score has the same meaning no matter which exam you take. Some people find that they score higher on the computer version of the test than the other two versions, an explanation of this is due to the fact that the computer based exam is tailored to their demonstrated ability level. These tests are beneficial because they help measure your potential; it gives you a good indicator of where your talents are. By viewing your scores, you can make intelligent career decisions. The higher score you have, the more job opportunities that are available to you.  Wiesen Test of Mechanical Aptitude The Wiesen Test of Mechanical Aptitude is a measure of a person's mechanical aptitude, which is referred to as the ability use machinery properly and maintain the equipment in best working order. The test is 30 minutes and has 60 items that can help predict performance for specific occupations involving the operation, maintenance, and servicing of tools, equipment, and machinery. Occupations in these areas require and are facilitated by mechanical aptitude. The Wiesen Test of Mechanical Aptitude was designed with the intent to create an evolution of previous tests that helps to improve the shortcomings of these earlier mechanical aptitude tests, such as the Bennett Test of Mechanical Comprehension. This test was reorganized in order to lessen certain gender and racial biases. The reading level that is required for the Wiesen Test of Mechanical Aptitude has been estimated to be at a sixth-grade level, and it is also available in a Spanish-language version for Spanish-speaking mechanical workers. Overall, this mechanical aptitude test has been shown to have less of an adverse impact [on what?] than previous mechanical aptitude tests. There are two scores given to each individual taking the test, a raw score and a percentile ranking. The raw score is a measure of how many questions (out of the 60 total) the individual answered correctly, and the percentile ranking is a relative performance score that indicates how the individual's score rates in relation to the scores of other people who have taken this particular mechanical aptitude test. Average test scores for the Wiesen Test of Mechanical Aptitude were determined by giving the test to a sample of 1,817 workers aged 18 and older working in specific industrial occupations that were mentioned previously. Using this sample of workers, it was determined that the Wiesen Test of Mechanical Aptitude has very high reliability (statistics) (.97) in determining mechanical aptitude in relation to performance of mechanical occupations.  Bennett Test of Mechanical Comprehension  The Bennett Mechanical Comprehension Test (BMCT) is an assessment tool for measuring a candidate's ability to perceive and understand the relationship of physical forces and mechanical elements in practical situations. This aptitude is important in jobs and training programs that require the understanding and application of mechanical principles. The current BMCT Forms, S and T, have been used to predict performance in a variety of vocational and technical training settings and have been popular selection tools for mechanical, technical, engineering, and similar occupations for many years. The BMCT is composed of 68 items, 30-minute time limited test, that are illustrations of simple, encountered mechanisms used in many different mechanisms. It is not considered a speeded time test, but a timed power test and the cut scores will provide the different job requirements for employers. The reading and exercise level of concentration for this test is below or at a sixth-grade reading level. In current studies of internal consistency reliability, the range of estimates were compared from previous studies and found out the range was from .84 to .92. So this shows a high reliable consistency when taking and measuring the BMCT. Muchinsky (1993) evaluated the relationships between the BMCT, a general mental ability test, and an aptitude classification test focused on mechanics, and supervisory ratings of overall performance for 192 manufacturing employees. Of the three tests, he found the BMCT to be the best single predictor of job performance (r = .38, p < .01). He also found that the incremental gain in predictability from the other tests was not significant. From a current employer standpoint, these people are typically using cognitive ability tests, aptitude tests, personality tests etc. And the BMCT has been used for positions such as electrical and mechanical positions. Also companies will use these tests for computer operators and operators in manufacturing. This test can also help eliminate any issues or variables to employers about who may need further training and instruction or not. This test will help show employers who is a master of the trade they are applying for, and will also highlight the applicants who still have some \\"catching up\\" to do.  Stenquist Test of Mechanical Aptitude  The Stenquist Test consist of a series of problems presented in the form of pictures, where each respondent would try to determine which picture assimilates better with another group of pictures. The pictures are mostly common mechanical objects which do not have an affiliation with a particular trade or profession, nor does the visuals require any prior experience or knowledge. Other variations of the test are used to examine a person's keen perception of mechanical objects and their ability to reason out a mechanical problem. For example, The Stenquist Mechanical Assemblying Test Series III, which was created for young males, consisted of physical mechanical parts for the boys to individually construct items with. == See also == * Spatial ability ==References * Mechanical Aptitude Practice Test Category:Cognitive tests Category:Recruitment Category:Industrial and organizational psychology Category:Intelligence tests ","title":"Mechanical aptitude"},{"id":"35245012","text":"The Union Election Commission (, abbreviated UEC) is the national level electoral commission of Myanmar (Burma), responsible for organising and overseeing elections in Burma, as well as vetting parliamentary candidates and political parties. ==Origins== The Union Election Commission is mandated by the Union Election Commission Law, enacted on 8 March 2010. ==Members== The UEC's members are appointed by the government, and must meet the following qualifications: * 50 years of age or older * a good public reputation, as determined by the government * dignity, integrity and experience * loyalty to the State and its citizens * not affiliated to any political parties * not hold any office or draw compensation as such The UEC appointed by the State Peace and Development Council after 2010 election were: # Tin Aye (Chairman) # Myint Naing (Member) # Aung Myint (Member) # Dr. Myint Kyi (Member) # Win Kyi (Member) # Nyunt Tin (Member) # Win Ko (Member) # Tin Tun (Secretary) Following were appointed as additional members of Union Election Commission later. # N Zaw Naung # Sai Kham Win # Saw Ba Hlaing # Ha Kee # Dr. Mg Mg Kyi # Sai Non Taung # Sai Htun Thein and # Dr. Sai San Win Current members The UEC's current members, appointed by the President Htin Kyaw on 30 March 2016. # Hla Thein (Chairman) # Aung Myint (Member) # Soe Yae (Member) # Tun Khin (Member) # Hla Tint (Member) ==List of chairperson== # Thein Soe (8 March 2010 - 30 March 2011) # Tin Aye (30 March 2011 - 30 March 2016) # Hla Thein (30 March 2016 ‚Äì present) ==Controversy== The UEC has been criticised for its powers to abolish elections in conflict areas.

The continuous violent outbreaks between communists and the defending Stewards led to Lord Rothermere, the owner of the Daily Mail, to withdraw the support of his paper, mainly out of pressure of government officials. The resulting poor publicity from left-wing newspapers also led to a decline in BUF membership. ==References== Category:Military wings of political parties Category:1930s in the United Kingdom Category:Fascism in the United Kingdom Category:Clothing in politics Category:Anti-communist organizations ","title":"Stewards (paramilitary organisation)"},{"id":"35245055","text":"The Jammu‚ÄìPoonch line is a proposed railway line from Jammu Tawi station via the Historic City of Akhnoor to Poonch via Kaleeth-Dori Dager-Chowki Choura- Bhambla-Nowshera-Rajouri.

It was held at Barnard College (a private women's liberal arts college in New York City) on April 24, 1982, and was presented as the annual Scholar and Feminist Conference IX, an integral part of the Barnard Center for Research on Women. The theme of the Conference was Sexuality. The Conference was set up as a framework for feminist thought to proceed regarding topics that many felt uncomfortable talking about. As Carole Vance, the Academic Coordinator of the Conference wrote in her letter inviting the participants \\"sexuality is a bread and butter issue, not a frill.\\" ==History== The Barnard Sex Conference was held in 1982 by the Barnard Center for Research on Women, then known as the Women's Center. It was organized by a group of feminists that included Ellen Dubois, Ellen Willis, Gayle Rubin, and was led by Carole Vance. Jane Gould, the director of the Women's Center then, calls it the \\"most controversial and perhaps the most important conference\\". The women who took part understood that this conference was important in light of the growing Women Against Pornography (WAP) movement led by Andrea Dworkin, Susan Brownmiller, and Robin Morgan. Therefore, the aim was to \\"move beyond debates about violence and pornography and to focus on sexuality apart from reproduction\\". It is important to notice that the Conference itself was not fully supported by the college itself, as Gould narrates in her autobiography. Many Barnard faculty members dropped out of the planning committee. Days before the Conference itself, the then President of Barnard College, Ellen V. Futter, began receiving phone calls and letters from WAP and other groups against the premise of the Conference. The day before the conference was scheduled to begin, Barnard College officials‚Äîin response to phone calls from angry members of anti-pornography groups‚Äîconfiscated 1500 copies of Diary of a Conference on Sexuality.https://muse.jhu.edu/article/409150/pdf The Diary, which was intended for distribution to conference participants, was a compilation of steering committee minutes, personal narratives, information about conference events, and work by feminist artists. Pdf. Angry letters and threats of losing funding were also major concerns. Despite all of the contention, the organizers went ahead with the event. The day of the Conference itself was extremely controversial. The Conference was picketed by the anti-pornography feminist group. WAP members picketed the conference and gave out handouts, leaflets and protests, wearing T-shirts with the words \\"For a Feminist Sexuality\\" on the front and \\"Against S/M\\" on the back. Accusations about the specific sexual practices of individual women involved in the conference were central to the outcry around the event. The Conference was very publicized in the news afterwards. Many articles and books have been inspired by this conference, the most famous being Carole Vance's Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality. The Lesbian Sex Mafia organized a radical \\"Speakout on Politically Incorrect Sex\\" rally at the conference.E. J.

It was released on June 19, 2012, by Megaforce Records. It was the band's first new album in eight years, after the release of the Lit album in 2004 and the death of their drummer Allen Shellenberger in 2009. The album is dedicated to Shellenberger's memory. In addition to being dedicated to Shellenberger, the album also features a track called \\"Here‚Äôs to Us\\", which is a tribute to him. It is the first album with the rhythm guitarist Ryan Gillmor and the only one with Nathan Walker on drums. ==Background== After the band released their fourth album, Lit in 2004, the band was hit with a number of hardships. A. Jay and Jeremy Popoff's stepfather died in a motorcycle crash that also severely injured their mother. While the band continued touring, eventually, in 2008, the band's drummer, Shellenberger, was diagnosed with a brain tumor and died the following year. After his death, Lit was unsure whether or not to continue as a band. The remaining members, during New Year's Eve in 2009, met at the bar they run, \\"The Slidebar\\", and decided to continue as a band and to make a fifth album. The album features a track called \\"Here‚Äôs to Us\\", which is a tribute to Shellenberger. This version is a re-recorded and reworked version of the same song that was featured in a slideshow on the band‚Äôs YouTube page. The pictures in the slideshow featured the band and Shellenberger. ==Writing and recording== The band began writing new material in various sessions in 2010 and 2011. They chose Nathan Walker, who had been both a close friend to the band and their drum tech, to fill in on drums. Ryan Gilmor was brought in as a new, fifth band member, to \\"round out the band's sound\\" as a rhythm guitarist and keyboard player. In late 2011, the band began recording with the producer Butch Walker. They extensively demoed songs and wrote many more than would appear on the album, both firsts for the band in the recording process. The album was primarily recorded live in the studio. ==Release and promotion== \\"Same Shit, Different Drink\\" was made available for free download on Rolling Stone's website in April 2012. The first single, \\"You Tonight\\", was released on iTunes on May 1, 2012, and the album was released on June 19, 2012. To promote the album's release, the band went on the Summerland Tour with Everclear, Sugar Ray, Gin Blossoms and Marcy Playground. \\\\- \\"Miss You Gone\\" was released to radio on August 7, 2012. A video for the single \\"The Broken\\" was released on August 16, 2012, and a video for \\"Miss You Gone\\" was released on June 13, 2013. ==Reception== The album received mixed reviews. Matt Collar at AllMusic praised the album, giving it a 3.5 out of 5 rating, stating \\"...one gets the sense that Lit are re-engaged here both emotionally and creatively...Ultimately, while the album may be about the band's View from the Bottom (whether that be career woes, the loss of a friend, or the bottom of a shot glass), as the title of the rousing set closer implies, Lit definitely got it \\"Right This Time.\\" However, Chuck Eddy of Rolling Stone was less enthusiastic, giving it only 2 out of 5 stars, claiming that the \\"riffs sound re-purposed for sports and strip bars.\\" Emily Kearns from Rock Sound, while only awarding it 6 out of 10, praised the album for being \\"polished fare awash with slick harmonies, clean guitars, heavy drumbeats, giant hooks and an unadulterated wall of gleaming pop ‚Äì much of which is laced with a sense of melancholy.\\" ==Track listingPersonnel== * A.

He was known for creating Eddsworld, a media franchise consisting of Flash animations and webcomics featuring fictionalised versions of himself and longtime collaborators Thomas Ridgewell, Matt Hargreaves and others. After Gould's death in 2012, production of Eddsworld was passed on to Ridgewell and later Hargreaves. ==Early life== Gould was born on 28 October 1988 in Isleworth, in Greater London to his mother, Susan \\"Sue\\" Gould and father Duncan Gould. He has a sister, Victoria \\"Vicky\\" Gould, and brother George Gould. Gould attended the Orleans Park School, (as shown on one of his first cartoons, titled Edd Again) and met Matt Hargreaves on a sports day event. Although disliking him at first, Gould became friends with Hargreaves upon the departure of his former best friend, David Chapman, and after Hargreaves was transferred to Gould's classroom. Gould declared he had a habit of drawing his friends into comics, so he included Hargreaves in what would become Eddsworld. Although first complaining about always getting killed on his early animations, Hargreaves became a prominent part of Eddsworld. Gould met Ridgewell online, a fan of his work, shortly after he started making stick animations. In the same way he met Ridgewell, Gould met Tord Larsson online as well, becoming good friends. Ridgewell and Larsson were eventually included in the Eddsworld cast along with Hargreaves, appearing in Eddsworld Christmas Special 2004. ==Career== In 2002, Gould began animating using a GIF animation program to publish on Stick Figure Death Theatre. Upon discovering the website no longer accepted GIFs, Gould moved to Macromedia Flash in November 2002. After seven months of learning the basics of Flash animation from his mentor Lavalle Lee, Gould published his first Newgrounds entry on 6 June 2003. Gould soon began his career in animation and studied as an independent animator at the University for the Creative Arts, Maidstone, England. Gould later joined Cake Bomb, a creative media group founded by Ridgewell. He also voiced the \\"I Like Trains\\" kid in TomSka's asdfmovie series on YouTube and animated the second episode of asdfmovie. ==Illness and death== On the afternoon of 16 April 2011, Gould revealed that he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a cancer of the white blood cells. This was the second time he had been diagnosed with this cancer, previously diagnosed in 2006. He posted a video on YouTube entitled \\"Edd vs Cancer\\" which featured Gould, Ridgewell, and Hargreaves discussing the diagnosis. Despite his health, Gould used his illness as a platform for several sketches on his friends' YouTube accounts. On the morning of 25 March 2012, Gould died from a recurring infection caused by his cancer. Ridgewell and Hargreaves announced Gould's death in a short video, \\"RIP Edd Gould (1988‚Äì2012)\\", on 27 March 2012. Gould's funeral was held on 10 April 2012 at All Saints Church in Isleworth, and a eulogy was compiled from various video clips from fans and friends giving condolences to Gould, shown at the funeral. His last episode for Eddsworld was \\"Space Face (Part 1)\\", which was released on YouTube on 2 June 2012. Production for Eddsworld was passed to Ridgewell and he continued to produce episodes as part of Gould's will. Under Ridgewell's direction, excess money and profits went to CLIC Sargent, a program which provided support to child cancer patients. Gould was cremated at Mortlake Crematorium after his funeral. In July 2012, Hargreaves and Ridgewell scattered some of Gould's ashes in Hollywood after they were at VidCon. ==Filmography== {  - ! Year !! Title !! Creator !! Writer !! Animator !! Actor !!

He is best remembered as a character and narrative source in Plato's Symposium, and is also preserved in Xenophon's Memorabilia and a fragment from Aristophanes. ==Life== Aristodemus is described as a barefooted runt of low birth in Plato's Symposium,Plato, Symposium, 173b while Xenophon refers to him as Aristodemus the dwarf (\\"·ºàœÅŒπœÉœÑœåŒ¥Œ∑ŒºŒøŒΩ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅ·Ω∏ŒΩ Aristodemon ton mikron\\"). He was a fellow demesman of the comedian Aristophanes, with whom he appears in the Symposium. Although little is known of his life, his depiction as a member of an earlier generation of Socratic followers places his birth in the early-mid 5th century BCE,Debra Nails, The People of Plato, Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002, pp. 52‚Äì53 a theory which is supported by his apparent inclusion in Aristophanes' comedy BanquetersAristophanes, Banqueters, fr. 242 (K 231) of 427. Scholars assume that his death preceded the end of the 5th century, since he was not present during Socrates' final days in 399 despite being a devoted student.Xenophon, Memorabilia, 1.4.2‚Äì19 ==Thought and depiction in literature== His own philosophy is equally obscure. It is best preserved through his depiction in Xenophon as an admirer of artists who neither prays nor sacrifices due to what he perceives as the gods' lack of need, leading some commentators to accredit Aristodemus with a potential brand of Socratic proto-atheism.Marie-Odile Goulet-Caz√©, \\"Religion and the Early Cynics\\". The Cynics. Ed. R. B. Branham, M. Goulet-Caz√©. Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1996, p. 54 R.D.C.

In 2013, Highfields returned $2 billion to clients. As Jacobson wrote to investors, \\"we would rather be slightly smaller and generate better [returns].\\" In October of 2018, Highfields announced in a letter that they would return all outside capital and would convert into a family office. In a third quarter letter to investors, Jacobson wrote, ‚ÄúDone correctly, money management is an all-consuming, 24/7 pursuit‚Ä¶ After three-and-a-half decades of sitting in front of a screen, I realized I am ready for a change.\\" Over the 20 years between 1998 and 2018, Highfields only lost money in two years: 2002 and 2008. ==Senior management== Richard Grubman and Jonathon Jacobson co- founded Highfields Capital Management LP in 1998.McIntosh, Bill, ed., \\"The US50\\", The Hedge Fund Journal in association with Newedge Prime Brokerage Group.

Dashilan is also a famous business street outside Qianmen. Now the term Dashilan is also used to refer to the area comprising, besides Dashilan itself, also the Langfang Toutiao Lane, Liangshidian Street and Meishi Street. ==Description== Dashilanr is located to the south of Tiananmen Square, west of Qianmen Street. The overall length of Dashilanr is 275m from east to west. At present, 36 stores from 11 trades are scattered along Dashilanr with an average customer flow of 150-160 thousand usually and 200 thousand in holidays. Because of the overall improvement of business environment in Beijing, the heart of retail business is no longer in the area of Qianmen and the business position Dashilanr once held is also on the wane. Except some China Time-honored Brands (), most of the present shops and stores of Dashilanr are offering goods of poor qualities at low prices. Meanwhile, there are many lawless men perpetrating frauds and extortion on the street. ==History== In the Ming dynasty, the name \\"Dashilanr\\" had not yet been recorded in the work of Zhang Zhupo, \\"Blocks and Streets in the Five Boroughs of Beijing\\". Only Langfang Toutiao, Langfang Ertiao, Langfang Santiao and Langfang Sitiao existed to the west of the road which was outside Qianmen. Langfang Sitiao was located in the same place as modern-day Dashilanr. It can be inferred that the place name ‚ÄúDashilanr‚Äù did not exist in the Ming dynasty. The so-called \\"Langfang\\" is often referred to as a storeroom along the street. Although the name \\"Dashilanr\\" was not used in the Ming dynasty, the place where Dashilanr situated was already a flourishing commercial district, with many merchants gathering. In 1488, in order to secure the public safety of the capital, the central government built wooden fences at all the entrances to the streets and lanes in Beijing. The fence was accomplished with contributions from the local residents, and the total number of the fences was more than 1,700 by the end of the Qing dynasty. Among them, the Langfang Sitiao street's fence was funded by the merchants. For this reason, the fence was extremely large and thus got the name \\"Dashilanr\\". With the passage of time, \\"Dashilanr\\" gradually became the formal name of the street replacing \\"Langfang Sitiao\\". In 1899, Dashilanr caught fire and the wooden fence was burnt. Since then, the fence has practically disappeared, leaving only the name \\"Dashilanr\\" itself. It was not until the year of 2000 that the Beijing government rebuilt an iron fence at the entrance of Dashilanr. ==Shops and stores== For centuries, the traditional commercial street Dashilanr has held quite a few China Time-honored Brands () which are well-known in China. The China Time-honored Brands, such as Tongrentang () Chinese herbal medicine store, Rui Fu Xiang () silk store, Ma Ju Yuan () hat store, Nei Lian Sheng () shoe store, Zhang Yi Yuan () tea shop, and Liu Bi Ju () pickle shop, as well as Yi Pin Zhai (),Yi Pin Zhai is a shoe shop. Bu Ying Zhai (),Bu Ying Zhai is a shoe shop. Ju Shun He (),Ju Shun He is a store which sells preserved fruit. Chang Sheng Kui (),Chang Sheng Kui is engaged with nuts and dried fruit. are over 100 years old. There once was a saying in Beijing, \\"Wear the hats of Ma Ju Yuan, stand in the shoes of Nei Lian Sheng, wear the clothes of Ba Da Xiang, and take the money of Si Da Heng Banks.\\" Ma Ju Yuan, Nei Lian Sheng, Ba Da Xiang () and Si Da Heng () are all stores located in Dashilanr that are taken as the symbols of wealth. Dashilanr was also the former entertainment center of Beijing apart from the commercial center. There were five grand Chinese opera theaters in Dashilanr: Qingle Yuan (), Sanqing Yuan (), Guangde Lou (), Guanghe Yuan (), Tongle Yuan (); the first movie theater in Beijing, Daguan Lou (), also situated there. In former times there were many brothels and opium dens in the area. ==Education== Tan'er Hutong (Coal Lane) Elementary School One school in this area is Tan'er Hutong (Coal Lane) Elementary School (S: ÁÇ≠ÂÑøËÉ°ÂêåÂ∞èÂ≠¶, T: ÁÇ≠ÂÖíËÉ°ÂêåÂ∞èÂ≠∏, P: T√†n'er H√∫t√≤ng Xi«éoxu√©). According to Michael Meyer, the author of The Last Days of Old Beijing: Life in the Vanishing Backstreets of a City and a former teacher at Tan'er Hutong, the school had no gazetteer that recorded the history, the principal was not aware of the school history, and historical texts did not document the school's history; Meyer explained that \\"[i]t took months to assemble\\" his written history on the school and that he had gathered information by \\"talking to people in the lanes like Mr. Xie.\\"Meyer, p. 150. Meyer's account says that the school first opened in 1950. Meyer states that originally it was a private school named Solemn Honor Elementary School. Meyer explains that, in 1956 the school was renamed Religious Service Temple Elementary School, due to the school's proximity to a religious temple, and became a government-operated school. Meyer states that, during that year, the school's name changed to Demonstrate Strength School. According to Meyer, in 1957 the school moved to a new location and adopted the name West Canal Bank School; the name referred to the school's location, adjacent to a stream of water that travels along the city wall. Meyer's account states that the school adopted the new name Front Gate West Street Elementary and Middle School in 1974. According to Meyer, in 1981 the elementary division separated into its own school, and began classes in a campus along Tan'er Hutong. During Meyer's period as a teacher, due to a widening project affecting Tan'er Hutong street, a different area elementary school was closed and demolished. Its employees and students were dispersed to various schools. Tan'er Hutong Elementary took two teachers and their students.Meyer, p. 89. ==ReferencesExternal links and further reading== * Meyer, Michael.

Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 556 U.S. 163 (2009), was a United States Supreme Court case about the former crown lands of the Hawaiian monarchy, and whether the state's right to sell them was restricted by the 1993 Apology Resolution. The Court, in an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, ruled unanimously that the state had the power to sell the lands free of encumbrances. ==Overview== In 1893, a \\"Committee of Safety,\\" in co-operation with United States minister to Hawaii John L. Stevens, overthrew the Kingdom of Hawaii and established a provisional government. The resulting Republic of Hawaii governed the islands until 1898, when the United States granted their proposal for annexation. Under the Newlands Resolution, the Republic of Hawaii \\"'cede[d] absolutely and without reserve to the United States of America all rights of sovereignty of whatsoever kind' and further 'cede[d] and transfer[red] to the United States the absolute fee and ownership of all public, Government, or Crown lands ... and all other public property of every kind and description belonging to the Government of the Hawaiian Islands.' The Newlands Resolution further provided that all 'property and rights' in the ceded lands 'are vested in the United States of America.'\\". The Hawaiian Organic Act established a territorial government for Hawaii in 1900. In the Organic Act, Congress provided that \\"The portion of the public domain heretofore known as Crown land is hereby declared to have been, on [1898], and prior thereto, the property of the Hawaiian government, and to be free and clear from any trust of or concerning the same, and from all claim of any nature whatsoever, upon the rents, issues, and profits thereof. It shall be subject to alienation and other uses as may be provided by law.\\" In 1959, Hawaii was admitted as a state by the Hawaii Admission Act. In that Act, Congress transferred title to most of the former Crown lands to the state, including the parcel at issue in this case. In 1993, the United States Congress adopted the Apology Resolution, in which the United States apologized for its role in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893. Shortly thereafter, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) sought to enjoin a residential development on a parcel of land owned by the state that was held in trust for Native Hawaiians and the general public. OHA also requested that the Housing Finance and Development Corporation (HFDC - the state agency in charge of the parcel's development) certify that any transfer of the parcel's ownership would not diminish Native Hawaiians' claims to the land and include a disclaimer to that effect. The HFDC refused, believing that such a disclaimer would render it impossible for future owners to obtain title insurance. HFDC sent OHA a check for the land. OHA refused to accept the payment. ==Procedural history== OHA filed suit in state court. The trial court held in favor of HFDC. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Hawaii reversed and held that the Apology Resolution changed the legal relationships of the parties and issued an injunction against development of the land until the state of Hawaii reconciled with Native Hawaiians. The state appealed to the United States Supreme Court in 2008. ==Decision== Issue Did the Apology Resolution bar the State of Hawaii from selling land held in public trust to third parties until the claims of Native Hawaiians to those lands were resolved? Parties' arguments The OFA argued that the Apology Resolution changed the relationship between Native Hawaiians and the government, restoring rights lost in the 1893 revolution. The State disagreed, arguing that language was intended only as an apology, with no changes in law being effected. Opinion of the Court Justice Samuel Alito, writing for a unanimous Court, reversed the Hawaii Supreme Court's ruling, holding that the Apology Resolution did not create any new right, nor did it change the relationship between the State and the Native Hawaiian community. The Apology uses only conciliatory words, which Congress does not use to create substantive rights. While the Resolution does state that it does not serve as a settlement of any claims against the United States, a disclaimer of settling claims against one sovereign (the United States) cannot be read to affirmatively recognize claims against another (the State of Hawaii.) ==Aftermath== After the decision, HFDC continued to develop the parcel, which will be called the Leiali'i Affordable Housing Project. It is expected to be complete by 2016. == See also == * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 556 * List of United States Supreme Court cases == References Hawaii v.

He was the 8th son of Emperor Taizong and a younger brother of Emperor Zhenzong. He was referred to as the \\"Eighth Prince\\" (ÂÖ´Â§ßÁéã). He was the only surviving paternal uncle of Emperor Renzong during the latter's reign. == Biography == As a child Zhao Yuanyan was known for his intelligence. He was a favorite of Emperor Taizong and often accompanied guests at his father's banquets. Zhao Yuanyan was also known for his filial piety as he would personally serve his mother, Consort Wang, every day when she became sick. Unlike others in the royal family, Zhao Yuanyan enjoyed books and literature. He also practiced calligraphy after the masters Wang Xianzhi and Wang Xizhi. When his young nephew Emperor Renzong succeeded the throne, Empress Liu acted as the real regent. In order to avoid conflicts with the empress dowager, Zhao Yuanyan stayed at home, feigning lunacy. Only after Empress Liu's death did he return to the imperial court, where he also revealed the secret that Consort Li, and not Empress Liu, was the emperor's real mother. Known for his stern demeanor, he became a trusted adviser of Emperor Renzong. When he became gravely ill, the emperor offered 5000 taels of silver but he refused, saying: \\"How can a man on death bed burden the country?\\" After his death, Emperor Renzong conducted memorials for him three times and distributed his writings and poems to different officials. == In fiction == The \\"Eighth Prince\\" or \\"Eighth Virtuous Prince\\" is an important character in folk stories about the generals of the Yang clan, the generals of the Huyan clan, Di Qing and Bao Zheng. Many works present his name as Zhao Defang (Ë∂ôÂæ∑Ëä≥), who in history is Zhao Yuanyan's cousin and died at the age of 22 in 981 during Emperor Taizong's reign, long before many of the stories' historical characters (including Zhao Yuanyan himself) were born. In fiction, the Eighth Prince married Di Qianjin (ÁãÑÂçÉÈáë), the aunt of Di Qing, and raised Emperor Renzong as his adoptive parents since infancy, as the baby was almost killed in a conspiracy orchestrated by Consort Liu. The fiction also said that the Eight Prince lived in the Southern Palace (ÂçóÊ∏ÖÂÆÆ) and had one son, Prince Luhua (ÊΩûËä±Áéã). == References == * Toqto'a et al., History of Song, vol. 245 (Zhao Yuanyan).

He released his first EP Skeleton in 2009 once he signed with Dim Mak Records. Since then he has gone on to release three full-length albums, 2010's Popular Music and 2012's Different Faces and 2018's Next Season. Deitcher has toured with Wolfgang Gartner, MSTRKRFT, and Bloody Beetroots. Deitcher set the trend of collaborating with unpredictable vocalists in the dance scene such as Sebastien Grainger of Death from Above 1979, Maja Ivarsson of The Sounds and Johnny Whitney of The Blood Brothers. ==Early life== In 2000, Deitcher attended New Westminster Secondary School in New Westminster, British Columbia. He began playing bass in the punk and hardcore scene with a band called Dysfunctional, named after a sticker they had found. Their musical style were inspired from groups such as Refused, NOFX and Anti-Flag. They had developed a small fanbase in North Vancouver and performed at venues before reforming into a more progressive, The Mars Volta/Pink Floyd-inspired group named Orange Orange, which broke up in 2006. Following the group's disintegration, Deitcher experimented with music production software such as Reason and Cubase. Influenced by the club nights and parties with local DJs, Deitcher acknowledged the similarity of the punk and EDM scenes which prompted him to get involve into the EDM scene. Deitcher enrolled at the University of British Columbia where he majored in English. He moved to Scotland for a semester at University of Glasgow. == Career ==  2006‚Äì10: Skeleton and Popular Music  In December 2006, he emerged on the international blog scene alongside MSTRKRFT with original songs such as Moss vs. Tree and Parisienne. During his time in the UK, Deitcher signed with a booking agent and started playing weekend shows across Britain and Europe. His third ever show was opening for Justice with an audience of over 4,000 people. By the time he returned to his hometown four months later, he was already an underground star. He opened for MSTRKRFT on their Fist of God tour. He released several more remixes before being signed to Steve Aoki's Dim Mak Records and released his first EP entitled Skeleton in May 2009. Four months later, Deitcher released Drone as the first single for his debut album Popular Music. Popular Music was released on February 23, 2010. Along with Drone, the album featured the singles Volanco featuring The Blood Brothers' Johnny Whitney, World Class Driver and Love. Music videos for Volcano and World Class Driver were made. Deitcher went on tours and performed at music festivals such as Electric Daisy Carnival, Camp Bisco, South by Southwest, and Winter Music Conference.  2011‚Äì12: Different Faces  In March 2011, Deitcher released a single titled The Joker via Dim Mak Records. The song became one of Deitcher's most notable work and was played in the live sets by notable DJs such as Benny Benassi, Laidback Luke and Diplo. After extensive touring, Deitcher started working on his sophomore album which featured several guest vocalists and focused more on catchy melodies, yet still retained his trademark aggressive sound. His second album, Different Faces was released on March 27, 2012, and featured the singles Don't Turn on the Lights featuring Polina Goudieva, \\"Domo\\", \\"Black to White\\" featuring Miss Palmer, and H.U.N.T featuring Sebastien Grainger. Different Faces debuted on the iTunes Top 10 Electronic chart in North America. Continuing his success, Deitcher started a biweekly podcast entitled The Weekend Workout, a one-hour mix showcasing new electronic dance music including unreleased Deitcher tracks. Starting in June 2012, it became a weekly mix broadcast worldwide on SiriusXM and available for free download on iTunes and SoundCloud. On July 25, 2012, a music video for Higher featuring New Ivory was released online. On August 14, 2012, Deitcher released the final single for Different Faces, Tonight featuring Maja Ivarsson of The Sounds, accompanied by an EP featuring remixes by Autoerotique, Botnek, and others. On December 4, 2012, Deitcher released single No Sleep featuring Natalie Angiuli. On December 20, 2012, Lullaby featuring Natalie Angiuli was released as a free download for the B-side to the recently released single No Sleep.  2013‚Äì15: Past Present Felix  Constantly touring North America and Europe, Deitcher released remixes for Zedd and The Bloody Beetroots. On January 22, 2013, he released a single titled The Alarm with Autoerotique. Collaborating with Clockwork, Deitcher released the single The Fire featuring Madame Buttons. He also produced a song for K.Flay titled Hail Mary featuring Danny Brown. On July 2, 2013, Deitcher released Young Love (featuring Koko LaRoo) as the first single from his four-track EP titled Past Present Felix. On July 25, 2013, the music video for Young Love was released online. Past Present Felix was released August 6, 2013. A 16-date headlining North American tour was announced in support of Past Present Felix through September and October 2013. December 3, 2013 saw the release of New Scene featuring Ofelia as the final single from Past Present Felix. Following the release of the single, the music video premiered December 19, 2013, on MTVu. After a successful tour, Deitcher released a three-song EP entitled Credits, featuring the lead single Ready for Love featuring Chloe Angelides, on April 29, 2014.  2015‚Äìpresent: Remixes, collaborations, and a new sound  In 2015, Deitcher signed with Universal Canada and released two singles: With You and Something To Live For. In early 2016, he showcased a new sound on remixes for Kiiara, Wafia, Anna of the North, and Selena Gomez. He then released a collaboration with Kaskade titled Fakin It and three original songs: Keep Up, Drifting Away, and Falling Down. In March 2017, he released Get What You Give, a remix cover of the New Radicals song, which earned him his first certified Gold Record, followed by Hold Tight in September 2017. He then collaborated with R3hab on the track Killing Time.  Next Season  In May 2018, he released his third studio album, Next Season. Released by Canadian record label Physical Presents, the album featured the singles Runaway featuring Regn, Walking By featuring Iselin, Faces featuring Veronica, and Worry featuring Victoria Zaro. Next Season received positive reviews from critics. The album featured a number of co-writers, including Ofelia, Veronica, Iselin, Kriss and Erik, Moon Bounce, REGN, and Nate. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Cartal cited Shel Silverstein, Drake, M83, The Beatles, and even Simpson Wave internet content as sources of inspiration for the album.

On March 27, 2012, the Airbus A320 serving the route diverted to Amarillo, Texas, after the captain, suffering from an apparent mental breakdown, started behaving erratically and was restrained by passengers. There were no fatalities.JetBlue plane in emergency landing after captain's apparent breakdown ==Incident== Captain Clayton Osbon was locked out of the cockpit by First Officer Jason Dowd and was subdued by passengers after he started acting erratically and ranting about terrorists and 9/11 and apparently suffered from an unspecified mental breakdown. The aircraft was then diverted to Amarillo. Osbon received medical treatment by Northwest Texas Healthcare System. Dowd grew concerned when Osbon made comments such as \\"We need to take a leap of faith\\", \\"We're not going to Vegas\\", and \\"I can't be held responsible when this plane crashes.\\" Osbon began giving what the first officer described as a sermon. Dowd tricked Osbon into going to the passenger compartment, then locked the cockpit door and changed the security code. Osbon railed at passengers about Jesus, Al-Qaeda, countries in the Middle East, and a possible bomb on board. Alarmed passengers tackled him and tied him up with seat belt extenders. An off-duty JetBlue pilot who was travelling as a passenger joined Dowd in the cockpit and the plane landed about 20 minutes later. Osbon was arrested and charged with \\"interference with a flight crew.\\"FBI -- JetBlue Pilot Charged with Interference with a Flight CrewOsbon Complaint Affidavit The 49-year-old Osbon was suspended from work after being with JetBlue for 12 years. He had attended Carnegie Mellon University and graduated in 1987 from Nathaniel Hawthorne College, an aeronautics and aviation college located in New Hampshire.https://www.youtube.com/#/watch?v=YobBs5eqkC0&desktop;_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DYobBs5eqkC0Nathaniel Hawthorne College at Closed Colleges == Trial and lawsuits == On Tuesday, July 3, 2012, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity of the charge of interference with the flight crew by an Amarillo, Texas-based federal judge, Judge Mary Lou Robinson. Mr. Osbon was then ordered to be held pending a further investigation; he was then immediately transferred to a mental health facility in Fort Worth for additional treatment. After Captain Osbon was evaluated in a federal mental health facility in North Carolina, on November 9, 2012, US District Judge Robinson freed him under the provisions that he continue mental health treatment, follow a prescribed medication regime, and meet a variety of other conditions. Osbon must continue to be monitored by his probation officer for an undetermined amount of time. \\"This is a bad situation for you and your family, but you are very fortunate to have the type of immediate support you have,\\" Robinson said. \\"Good Luck, Mr. Osbon.\\" On March 27, 2015, passengers filed a suit against JetBlue for $14.9 million, claiming that the airline did not ensure Osbon was fit to fly, and endangered the lives of the crew and the passengers. The passenger suit was filed 3 days after the Germanwings Flight 9525 crash, in which the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane killing all the people aboard. The passenger suit was settled the following month; terms of the settlement were not disclosed to the public. == Causes of illness == The cause of Osbon's mental breakdown remains unknown. Possibilities suggested included the onset of a psychotic disorder, a neurological event that compromised his brain function, or intoxication due to medication. In March 2015, Osbon filed a lawsuit against JetBlue in which he claimed the incident was caused by a complex partial brain seizure. ==See also== *List of air rage incidents ==References== Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 2012 Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Airbus A320 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents in Texas Category:2012 in Texas 191 Category:March 2012 events in the United States ","title":"JetBlue Flight 191"},{"id":"35245447","text":"Leah Busque Solivan (born November 15, 1979), the founder of TaskRabbit, is an American entrepreneur.

Sanger was arrested twice while in operation for the illegal distribution of contraceptives and for being a public nuisance1. Sanger was charged with 30 days in jail where she began publishing the Birth Control Review (1917). The predecessor to the Birth Control Review was Sanger‚Äôs previous publication titled ‚ÄúWoman Rebel,‚Äù a seven issue periodical running March- October 1914. This journal was the first to publish the term ‚Äúbirth control‚Äù in print (coined by Otto Bobsien). This would subsequently lead to the Sanger use of the term to mobilize the Birth Control movement of the 20th century. Sanger‚Äôs brief stay in prison and its surrounding publicity launched her into martyrdom and sparked a revitalized interest in the birth control moment earning her numerous donors to support her periodical. Sanger remained editor-in-chief until 1928 when she stepped down and the American Birth Control League took over1. ==Content== The main goal of the Review was to increase public support for birth control by attracting the support of doctors, legislators, academics, and the middle class and wealthy society women. The BCR urged its readers join groups such as American Birth Control League (which spanned 10 different branches and later became Planned Parenthood). Content included news of birth control activities, articles by scholars, activists, and writers on birth control, and reviews of books and other publications. The Review also included art and fiction in the form of cartoons, poetry and short stories as well as, case studies and first hand account/testimonies from women, often lower class persons of color. ==Circulation== The Comstock Act of 1873 made mailing information about birth control and contraceptives illegal. Fourteen states prohibited the verbal transmission of information about contraception or abortion, while eleven others made possession of instructions for the prevention of pregnancy a criminal offense. == References  External links == * * Category:Lifestyle magazines published in the United States Category:Defunct women's magazines published in the United States Category:English-language magazines Category:Health magazines Category:Magazines established in 1917 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1940 Category:Magazines published in New York (state) Category:Parenting magazines ","title":"Birth Control Review"},{"id":"35245464","text":"Cat Hill is a settlement on Ascension Island, an island which forms part of the British Overseas Territories. ==History== The Target Tracking Radar Station, known as the Golf Ball, was built on this site, designated for use as a base for the United States Armed Forces, between 1960 and 1961.

It is native to Tropical Asia and Malaya. Botanical synonyms include Leucas bancana Miq., Phlomis zeylanica Linn., and Spermacoce denticulata Walp. It is also known as ‡∂ú‡∑ê‡∂ß‡∂≠‡∑î‡∂π (geta- tumba) in Sinhala, halkusha in Bengali, guldora in Punjabi, kulnnphul in Gujarati, goma madhupati in Hindi, kubo in Sindhi, bhutamari in Oriya, bahuphul in Marathi, thumbai in Tamil, thumbe in Kannada, thummi in Telugu, and thumba in Malayalam. ==Description== The plant grows to a height of up to . Stipules are absent, the taproot is white or brown, and the stem is quadrangular. Sub-sessile leaves are linear-lanceolate or elliptic-lanceolate, long, not lobed or divided, blunt at the tip, obtuse, entire or cerrulate, glandular, hispid and coarsely dentate at the margins. Whorls of many flowers are bisexual, sessile or sub-sessile, usually in terminal whorls in diameter, grouped together in an axillary, corolla white in color and 2 cm long. Calyx is long, and obliquely turbinate, with minute teeth, apex acute, base acute, pinnately veined, erect or spreading horizontally. It is reproduced by seed and pollinated by bees moths and flies. Leucas belongs to the subfamily Lamioideae, and is closely related to the small genera Acrotome and Leonotis. ==Habitat== Plant occurs in various habitats, a weed of sunny dry localities, often on sandy soils, paddy dams, waste places, open grasslands, road-sides from the lowland up to in altitude. It is widely distributed throughout Southeast Asia, but is rather rare in East Asia. ==Constituents== A decoction of the herb prepared by boiling with a soda solution emits a strong odor; when condensed, the vapor yields ammonia and a volatile alkaloid in the distillate. ==Uses== Culinary The whole herb has a bitter taste, but is still used as flavoring or potherb. Traditional medicine The indigenous tribes in the Satpuda region of Dhule and Jalgaon districts of Maharashtra use L. zeylanicain for fever, jaundice, and for scorpion and snake bites. Agricultural Many species in the genus Leucas are becoming serious weeds in rice fields, sugarcane, and banana plantations.  Cultural  The flower of Thumba plant is an essential part of Onam festival in Kerala. The tiny flower of the plant is very important for laying Pookkalam. ==Essential oil== Leucas zeylanica yields a small amount of essential oil on distillation. The major components are oleic acid, hexadecanoic acid, 1-octen-3-ol, and caryophyllene. It has the ability to inhibit of test bacterial growth, especially Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis. ==Research== In a study of 32 plants species collected from serpentine (ultramafic) soils in Sri Lanka and screened for antimicrobial properties, L. zeylanica showed photo-mediated activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. L. zeylanica showed population-level variation in photoactivity. Study suggests plants from serpentine environments may have alterered antimicrobial activities compared to non-serpentine environments, and that attention is needed in deciding on the substrate and habitat when collecting plants to test for antimicrobial properties. ==Common names== * English: Ceylon slitwort * Sinhalese: ‡∂ú‡∑ê‡∂ß‡∂≠‡∑î‡∂π *Malayalam : ‡¥§‡µÅ‡¥Æ‡µç‡¥™ ==References== Category:Plants used in Ayurveda zeylanica ","title":"Leucas zeylanica"},{"id":"35245504","text":"HaqƒÅ'iq al-FurqƒÅn (Urdu: ÿ≠ŸÇÿßÿ¶ŸÇ ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ±ŸÇÿßŸÜ, haqƒÅ'iq-ul-furqƒÅn, lit. \\"Inner Verities of the Discriminant\\") is a 4 volume exegesis of the Quran compiled from the discouces and sermons of al-HƒÅjj MawlƒÅnƒÅ HƒÅfiz Hakƒ´m Noor-ud-Din, the first Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.

In educating female physicians, the Women's Medical College not only provided women access to the medical profession, but also medical care. In a meeting at the Union League Club of New York in March 1878, Robert B. Roosevelt suggested that the \\"deplorable health of women was owing to a want of proper medical advice. The sympathy of women for one another enabled the female physician to penetrate to the very source of the disease. Nothing was hidden from her through motives of delicacy. Mountains of headgear, thin-soled shoes, glove- fitting and shape-destroying corsets no doubt have considerable influence in producing general ill-health among women; but he was persuaded that the lack of medical adviser of their own sex had been the leading cause.\\" Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi spoke at the same meeting, and stated that the aim of the association was to put \\"the medical education of women on an equality with that of male students.\\" The Alumnae Association was formed in 1870, and included both graduates of the Medical College and other female physicians in the New York City area.

After the wolf left his pack in 2011, he wandered generally southwest for more than through Oregon and northern California. He was the first confirmed wild wolf in western Oregon since 1947 and the first in California since 1924. By 2014, OR-7 had settled in the Rogue River watershed in the southern Cascade Range east of Medford, Oregon, with a mate. It is not known when the two wolves met, but DNA tests of fecal samples showed that she is related to wolves in two of the eight packs in northeastern Oregon. In early 2015, officials designated the two adult wolves and their offspring as the Rogue Pack, the first wolf pack in western Oregon and the state's ninth overall since wolves returned to Oregon from Idaho in the 1990s. The batteries in OR-7's tracking collar expired in October 2015, and monitoring the pack since then has depended on trail cameras and live sightings. Meanwhile, other wolves have migrated into the mountainous cross-border region, and relatives of OR‚Äì7 have formed two packs in northern California. OR-7 was not observed at the 2020 winter count of wolves in Oregon, and is presumed to have died. ==Background== Wolves were reintroduced into the Northern Rocky Mountains in the 1990s. In February 2011, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) attached radio collars to several wolves in the Imnaha Pack in northeastern Oregon to allow study of their migration. The pack was Oregon's first since wolves returned to the state. The wolves were numbered; one of them, a year-old male from the pack's second litter, was given the code OR-7 as the seventh wolf to be collared. ==Migration== Approximate route of OR-7 between September 2011 and March 2012 As is common for non-dominant wolf males, OR-7 left the Imnaha Pack in the Wallowa Mountains near Joseph in September 2011, presumably in search of a mate. In November, he became the first wolf detected in western Oregon in more than 60 years when he was photographed east of Butte Falls by an automatic trail camera. This marked the first known wild wolf presence in southwestern Oregon since 1946. The wolf crossed the border into northern California in late December, becoming the first documented wolf in the state since 1924. OR-7 remained in California, trekking through Siskiyou, Shasta and Lassen counties until heading north to Klamath County, Oregon, in March 2012. OR-7 soon made his way to Jackson County. By then the wolf had traveled more than . OR-7 returned to California, spending the summer in the Plumas National Forest south of Mount Lassen, and as of December 2012 had migrated to near Lake Almanor. He returned to Oregon in March 2013. OR-7's migration captured the attention of viewers around the world after the story \\"went viral\\" in early December 2011. In 2012, OR-7 was named \\"Journey\\" through an art and naming competition for children sponsored by the non-profit group Oregon Wild. The conservation group acknowledged that the naming contest \\"was part of an effort to make the wolf too famous to kill\\". Steve Pedery, conservation director of Oregon Wild, said of the wolf: \\"Journey is the most famous wolf in the world. It is not surprising that the paparazzi finally caught up with him.\\" ==Pack formation== Two wolf pups of about 6-weeks of age in Southern Oregon. OR-7 is the father, and a wolf from the Minam and Snake River packs is the mother. In May 2014, remote cameras in the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest captured photographs of OR-7 along with a female wolf who might have mated with him. A month later, biologists from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the ODFW returned to southwest Oregon, photographed two wolf pups, and took fecal samples for DNA testing to determine the relationship of the pups to OR-7. By September, tests run at the University of Idaho confirmed that OR-7's mate is a wolf, that the two pups are their offspring, and that the mate is related to the wolves in the Minam and Snake River packs of northeastern Oregon. The birth of wolf pups so close to the state border raised the probability of a future long-term wolf population in California. In June 2014, the California Fish and Game Commission voted 3‚Äì1 to protect those wolves under the state Endangered Species Act. The adult wolves and their pups remained east of Medford in the Rogue River watershed, and in early 2015 officials named the group the Rogue Pack, the ninth contemporary wolf pack in Oregon. By July, wildlife biologists found evidence that OR-7 and his mate had produced a second litter of pups. A month later, trail cameras identified two new pups, bringing the known total of wolves in this pack to seven. By 2016, the pack size had grown to nine. The batteries in OR‚Äì7's Global Positioning System tracking unit expired in October 2015. Officials decided to replace the collar in order to keep track of the pack, which is protected under Oregon law and the federal Endangered Species Act. However, attempts to trap OR-7 or other members of the pack failed, and further tracking of OR-7 depended on trail cameras and live sightings. A trail camera in the Rogue River ‚Äì Siskiyou National Forest captured an image of OR-7 and one of his offspring in early 2016. After four steers were killed by wolves in Wood River Valley in western Klamath County (immediately east of Jackson County) near where OR‚Äì7 was last seen, biologists said efforts to trap and re-collar the wolf would likely resume and that tracking could alert ranchers concerned about their livestock. On October 3, 2017, biologists caught and collared OR-54, another Rogue Pack wolf, thought to be OR-7's daughter, traveling with the pack in Wood River Valley. In lieu of another tracking device on OR-7, the collar on OR-54 will allow officials to track the movements and behaviors of the pack. OR-54 was found dead on February 5, 2020, in Shasta County. OR-7 was seen in Oregon in fall 2019 but was not found at the state count of wolves the following winter, and is presumed to have died at about 11 years old, an advanced age for a wild wolf. Since 2015, wolves outside the Rogue Pack have also migrated to western Oregon. These include what officials have termed the \\"Keno Pair\\" near Keno, further south in Klamath County, and the \\"Silver Lake Wolves\\" in Lake County. The Oregon wolf population reached an estimated minimum of 110 in 2015, and 112 in 2017. ==Dispersal to California== A pup from the Lassen Pack Although OR-7 was the first gray wolf to visit California in nearly 100 years, other wolves have since migrated to Siskiyou County, just south of the Oregon‚ÄìCalifornia border. In 2015, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) released a photo of the Shasta Pack, consisting of two adults and five pups. The breeding pair came from the same pack as OR-7, making them his siblings. In 2017, the CDFW and the U.S. Forest Service determined that at least three wolf pups from a second pack, the Lassen Pack, can be traced to OR-7. One of OR-7s male offspring mated with another wolf to produce the pups, the birth of which made Journey a grandfather. The Lassen Pack, which lives in Lassen National Forest, is California's second pack since wolves were eradicated from the state in the 1920s. In June 2017, CDFW biologists fitted the female of the Lassen Pack breeding pair with a tracking collar. ==In popular culture== German-born filmmaker Clemens Schenk, who lives in Bend, has created a documentary, : The Journey. A look-alike wolf from Wolf People, an Idaho reserve, is the star of the film, which includes interviews with wolf experts as well as a woman who encountered OR-7 in the wild. The initial screening of the documentary took place in 2014 at the Hollywood Theatre in Portland. Children's author Rosanne Parry's novel A Wolf Called Wander is based loosely on the story of OR-7. ==See also== * List of grey wolf populations by country * List of wolves * Slavc ==References *Map of known wolf activity in Oregon in 2016 by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife *Wolf OR-7 Expedition Documentary of six adventurers retracing the route taken by OR-7 Category:2009 animal births Category:Individual animals in the United States Category:Individual wild animals Category:Individual wolves Category:Natural history of California Category:Natural history of Oregon Category:Wolves in the United States ","title":"OR-7"},{"id":"35245785","text":"Babu Banarasi Das University (BBDU) is a state private university having its Main Campus in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India established by Akhilesh Das in 2010 and named after his father and former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Babu Banarasi Das.

This led to the creation of Talim-ul- Islam College in Qadian, India, in 1898. The theology section was later separated and inaugurated as Jamia Ahmadiyya Qadian on 20 May 1928 by Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad, Khalifatul Masih II of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. Following the Partition of the Indian subcontinent, the Community relocated its headquarters to Rabwah, Pakistan. Keeping in view the needs of the Community in Pakistan, Jamia Ahmadiyya Rabwah was established. Since then, due to the exponential growth of the Community around the globe, campuses have been opened in many countries throughout the world. ==Degree and curriculum== Two types of degrees are offered in most Jamias. * Shahid degree: This is the seven-year course. In some Jamias (e.g. in United Kingdom) this is the only course offered. * Mubashar degree: This is a four-year course offered in many Jamias. Some Jamias have associated Mu'allam courses as well. This course is shorter than the Shahid degree. The curriculum for the Jamia Ahmadiyyas around the globe is nearly same and is organised and compiled by scholars of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. The only differences are in the regional languages taught which are according to the locations of the institutions. The curriculum generally consists of: * Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) * Modern Standard Arabic * Urdu * International Languages (i.e. Spanish, etc.) * Regional Languages (based on the location of the school i.e. German is taught in the German Jamia, English is taught in the Canadian Jamia) * Tasawwuf * Ilm al-Hadith (Science of the Sayings of Muhammad) * Tafsir (Exegesis of the Qur'an) * History of Science * Islamic History * Kalam (logic and argumentation) ==Mufti Silsila== The current Mufti Silsila (International Mufti of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community), Maulana Mubashir Ahmad KahlonMufti Silsila Mubashir Ahmad Kahlon is a graduate of Jamia Ahmadiyya.

He also wrote extensively on Russian composers of the Soviet period, especially Dmitri Shostakovich. ==Life and career== Zhitomirsky studied music theory at Kharkiv Conservatory under S.S. Bogatiryov, then music history and theory with Ivanov- Boretsky and composition with Zhilyayev at the Moscow Conservatory, where he graduated in 1931. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Zhitomirsky was a member of the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM) and served as a music critic for the journals Prolietarskiy muzikant (The Proletarian Musician) and Za proletarskuya muziku (For Proletarian Music).Gojowy, New Grove (2001) Throughout his career, he served a variety of newspapers and periodicals as a music critic.Keldish, New Grove (1980). Zhitomirsky began teaching music history and introductory classes in music analysis at the Moscow Conservatory in 1931 and in 1936 was made senior lecturer. Forced to leave his post in 1937, he was quickly reinstated. He was dismissed again in 1948, the year of the Zhdanov decree that affected composers Aram Khachaturian, Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich, in a.Kuhn, 138. The cause for his dismissal, a printed denunciation by the Union of Soviet Composers and an official censure was anti-Semitism, conducted under the bureaucratic veneer of a campaign against \\"cosmpolitalism.\\" According to musicologists Judith Kuhn and Richard Taruskin, this campaign, which included the murder of virtually every Jewish cultural activist over a five-year period, became the first instance of anti-Semitism as \\"official government policy in the Soviet Union.\\"Taruskin, 6. Also see Kuhn, 47-78; 137-39. Following this political fallout, Zhitomirsky taught as senior lecturer at the conservatory of Azerbaijan Conservatory in Baku from 1949 to 1953 and at the Gorky Conservatory from 1955 to 1970. In 1965, he was made a senior scientific officer at the Moscow Institute for the History of Art. While Zhitomirsky focused primarily on Schumann's music, letters and written articles, he also studied Russian musical culture of the later 19th and early 20th centuries. He was the first Russian musicologist to assess the music of Alexander Scriabin in the context of the spiritual movements with which the composer was associated. He also wrote on Soviet composers of the 1920s, especially Shostakovich. He wrote his articles, reviews and reminiscences of Shostakovich in what Detlev Gojowy, in the New Grove, called \\"a nonconformist attitude.\\" Zhitomirsky's presentation at the Leningrad conference of 1968, Gojowy adds, was similarly colored and shed new light on the history of Soviet music. However, toward the end of his life, he developed a conservative attitude on contemporary music, especially about avant-garde composers. ==Degrees and honors== Zhitomirsky received his Kandidat degree in 1942 with a dissertation on Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. He received his doctorate in 1942 with a dissertation on Robert Schumann. He was awarded the Robert Schumann Prize of the City of Zwickau in 1966. ==Shostakovich== In The Shostakovich Casebook, Irina Nikolskaya portrays Zhitomirsky as someone who \\"made\\" Shostakovich into an acceptable artist for the Soviet bureaucracy. At a June 1929 meeting of the RAPM, where members denounced Shostakovich's opera The Nose for \\"formalism\\" and \\"anti-Soviet escapism\\", Zhitomirsky reportedly pointed his fist at the composer and said, \\"If he does not accept the falsity of his path, then his work will inevitably find itself at a dead end.\\"MacDonald, 61; Maes, 264. Later, however, Zhitomersky became a supporter of the composer and may have ghost written some of his official speeches and articles.Fanning, New Grove (2001), 23:284, Eighth Quartet, 15. Nikolskaya says Zhitomirsky eventually portrayed Shostakovich as an artist \\"living in internal exile, one who totally rejected the existing system and repudiated everything Soviet.\\"Nikolskaya, 176. Zhitomirsky's positive review and subsequent defense of Shostakovich's Ninth Symphony, which would be singled out by the authorities for its \\"formalism\\" under the Zhdanov decree, might not have helped his personal position.Fay, 147‚Äì148. He also defended the Third String Quartet, written at approximately the same period, when other Soviet critics remained silent. In a monograph on the composer, Zhitomirsky emphasized the quartet's \\"rich and multi-faceted content\\" and called it \\"an entire world of romantic feelings, where the beauty of bright, 'naive' daydreams exists side-by-side with austere patriotic passion, with grief and heroism.\\"Kuhn, 101‚Äì102. Much later, while Zhitomirsky remained resolute against serial music in general, he defended Shostakovich's use of the 12-tone system in his late works. In the September 1976 issue of Sovietskaia muzyka (Soviet Music), he emphasized the \\"indissoluble connection between the tonal and atonal moments in Shostakovich's music\\" and the fact that the composer's atonal themes \\"create the optimal conditions for the expulsion of a tonal center.... The tonal beginning of them, as is correct, does not vanish, although frequently it is as if already hanging by a thread.\\" Zhitomirsky claimed that Shostakovich used 12-tone themes for expressive effect and were thus an extension of a type of \\"melodic intensity\\" which had existed since the 19th century.Schmelz, 316, 318. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Fanning, David, \\"Shostakovich, Dmitry (Dmitriyevich).\\" In The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Second Edition (London: Macmillan, 2001), 29 vols., ed.

A founder member of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) he was the early public face of the movement as the organisation's spokesman, and he later became involved in the group's attempts to politicise. He was assassinated by the Provisional IRA as part of the Troubles. Author Steve Bruce described Smyth as the \\"sometime editor of the Ulster Militant and a loose cannon who enjoyed an exciting and erratic relationship with the UDA\\".Robert William White, Ruair√≠ √ì Br√°daigh: the life and politics of an Irish revolutionary, Indiana University Press, 2006, p.379 ==Development of the UDA== Smyth was a native of Louisa Street in Belfast, a loyalist interface area street which linked the Crumlin Road to the Oldpark Road and which faced \\"the Bone\\", a Catholic area at the bottom of Ardoyne.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA: Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror, Penguin Ireland, 2004, p. 21 According to Smyth the area was regularly attacked by republicans from Ardoyne throwing nail bombs and shooting, and that in response he organised local men into a vigilante group. The group erected barriers on Louisa Street although these were removed by the British Army, which had a base in the area.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 21‚Äì22 In his youth he had worked at Harland & Wolff shipyard. Smyth attended and addressed meetings at Aberdeen Street school on the Shankill Road which were organised by Alan Moon, who had a similar group in that area. Several of these groups from across Belfast met and agreed to pool their resources, leading to the formation of the Ulster Defence Association in September 1971.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 22 Smyth, who was a community worker in the Lower Oldpark area and who was considered articulate, was the first public spokesman for the new movement. His first engagement came in 1972 when he appeared, wearing a mask, on a television debate with John Hume, warning him of a \\"Protestant backlash\\" against the recent formation of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP).McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 26 Smyth's rhetoric at this time was noted for its extremism. He reacted to an interview with D√°ith√≠ √ì Conaill published in the press by stating \\"at that moment in time I could have, without a twinge of conscience, bombed every well-filled chapel in Belfast\\".McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 27 He also edited a news sheet entitled Ulster Militant which urged war on republicans and their \\"passive sympathisers\\" by the emerging UDA. The journal also repeated claims, which had initially appeared earlier in the Protestant Telegraph, that the Easter Rising had been personally blessed by Pope Benedict XV as well as allegations of Smyth's own devising that the green, white and orange colours of the Flag of Ireland had been chosen to represent the Papacy rather than Thomas Davis's desire that Protestant and Catholic should unite in peace and that James Connolly, the socialist activist whose Irish Citizen Army had taken part in the 1916 Rising, had been ordained as a priest in the Roman Catholic Church.Yonah Alexander & Alan O'Day, Ireland's Terrorist Dilemma, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1986, p. 155 All of this was despite the fact that Smyth's previous community work had seen him participate in a number of projects involving Catholics and Protestants, particularly with regards to housing. As chairman of the Lower Shankill Community Association he had even spoke at events at University College Dublin and University College Galway. He briefly enrolled at Queen's University Belfast around 1974 as a mature student but did not stay long. ==Decline in influence== Smyth took up the cause of recruitment for the UDA, and travelled around Belfast and beyond securing new members for the organisation. However he was seen as lacking any military ability and as the UDA increasingly moved from vigilantism to sectarian killings his input became less important and he was sidelined. His position of leadership had effectively ended by 1973, by which time other early leaders such as Jim Anderson, had also been pushed aside with power lying firmly in the hands of Charles Harding Smith and Tommy Herron.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 64 As the UDA's public spokesman, Smyth was a prominent figure in the May 1974 Ulster Workers' Council strike and he produced the daily bulletin of the Ulster Workers' Council (UWC) for the duration of the strike with Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party politician David Trimble.Dean Godson, Himself Alone: David Trimble and the Ordeal of Unionism, HarperCollins UK, 2005p. 46 Following the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which were carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) during the strike, Smyth told the media \\"I am very happy about the bombings in Dublin. There is a war with the Free State and now we are laughing at them\\".McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 78 The outcry which followed Smyth's statements on the bombings saw him disciplined by the UDA ‚Äì in the form of a punishment beating ‚Äì before being formally removed as UDA spokesman.Godson, Himself Alone, pp. 46‚Äì47 ==Political activity== In the aftermath of the strike, Andy Tyrie added Smyth to his new political initiative, the New Ulster Political Research Group (NUPRG), reasoning that the articulate Smyth could be of use in raising the profile of the UDA and helping to secure funding from overseas.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 88 Smyth emphasised the working class nature of the UDA and was highly critical of the mainstream unionist politicians, adopting a siege mentality populism similar to that endorsed by some White nationalist populists in the southern United States, albeit with a Protestant rather than a white identity as the basis and Catholics rather than African-Americans as the out-group.Rona M. Fields, Northern Ireland: Society Under Siege, Transaction Publishers, 1977, p. 177 As part of his taste for populism and community politics, Smyth advocated the establishment of a Community Convention to be made of delegates from interested parties such as community groups, trade unions and paramilitaries although he did not reveal what purpose he had in mind for this body and in the event it was not adopted as an official UDA or NUPRG policy.Sarah Nelson, Ulster's Uncertain Defenders, Appletree Press, 1984, p. 198 In 1974, Smyth appeared on an edition of Weekend World alongside William Craig and Ruair√≠ √ì Br√°daigh debating the future of Northern Ireland. On air the two paramilitaries agreed that they both felt alienation from mainstream politics, whilst in a discussion off air Smyth intimated to √ì Br√°daigh that he might be amenable to the notion of a federal Ireland, something that was central to √ì Br√°daigh's own √âire Nua policy.White, Ruair√≠ √ì Br√°daigh, p. 214 In the late summer of 1975, a group of American academics and businesspeople with Irish links organised a conference in Amherst, Massachusetts to discuss the future of Northern Ireland. Although they sent out invitations to several leading political and paramilitary figures few chose to attend, with the exception of Irish Republican Socialist Party leader Seamus Costello and the Reverend Martin Smyth, the Grand Master of the Orange Institution. The invitation was refused by the Ulster Volunteer Force whilst Provisional IRA representatives who accepted were refused entry visas; however, the UDA sent a delegation made up of Andy Tyrie, Glen Barr and Sammy Smyth. Whilst the delegation pushed the ideals of Ulster nationalism, which was found favour with the UDA at that point, during the debates Smyth's main contribution was to argue that the civil rights that had dominated nationalist rhetoric was as applicable to Protestants as it was to Catholics.Ian S. Wood, Crimes of Loyalty': A History of the UDA, Edinburgh University Press, 2006, pp. 62‚Äì63 ==Later activity== Smyth was interviewed by The News Letter in 1976 and he discussed the formation and development of the then legal UDA in some detail with the paper.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 23. Note: The UDA remained a legal paramilitary organisation until 1992 Around the same time he gave an interview to The Gown in which he endorsed sectarian killings, arguing that \\"war exists in Northern Ireland and in a war situation there are no innocent people\\" before adding that \\"there will be no room for R.C.s [Roman Catholics] in a new state\\".Alexander & O'Day, Ireland's Terrorist Dilemma, p. 205 Despite these pronouncements Smyth had returned to his earlier interests in housing advocacy and was again working on behalf of some Catholics. He was a regular visitor to the staunchly republican New Lodge area where he was involved in housing issues.David McKittrick et al, Lost Lives, Mainstream Publishing, 2008, p. 632 For his own part Smyth had moved to Downshire Park East in the Cregagh area of east Belfast. In 1976, Smyth was caught in the crossfire of a loyalist feud between the UDA and the UVF which had its roots in the UWC strike and which had continued on and off ever since. In early 1976 Smyth, who was still acting as spokesman for the UDA on an occasional basis, was attacked at his home by members of the UVF and, whilst he was able to prevent them from entering the house, he still suffered minor injuries in the attack.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 100 On 10 March 1976, Smyth was shot and killed by the IRA whilst he visited his sister on Alliance Avenue in Ardoyne. He was 46 years old.A Chronology of the Conflict ‚Äì 1976 ==References== Category:1929 births Category:1976 deaths Category:Ulster Defence Association members Category:Deaths by firearm in Northern Ireland Category:People killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army Category:People from Belfast ","title":"Sammy Smyth (loyalist)"},{"id":"35246095","text":"James Michael Scott (born July 16, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Virginia Cavaliers. ==High school career== Scott played his high school career at Deep Creek High School and then prepped for a year at Hargrave Military Academy. Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Scott was listed as the No. 33 power forward and the No. 115 player in the nation in 2007. ==College career== Scott with Virginia in February 2012 After a solid first three years in which he led the Virginia Cavaliers in rebounding as a sophomore and junior, Scott appeared poised for a breakout year in 2010‚Äì11. He began the year averaging 15.9 points and 10.2 rebounds in the team's first ten games. But Scott's season ended early as he suffered an ankle injury and underwent season-ending surgery. Due to his injury, Scott was granted a medical redshirt and a fifth year of eligibility. He was one of the top players in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in 2011‚Äì12, averaging 18.0 points and 8.3 rebounds per game and led the ACC in field goal percentage at .563. He led the Cavaliers to a 22‚Äì10 record and their first NCAA tournament berth in five years, but lost to Florida in the round of 64. Scott received conference recognition as the second-leading vote getter for the All-ACC team and national recognition as an All-American by the Sporting News (third team) and the Associated Press (Honorable Mention). Scott finished his Virginia career with 1,538 points and is the third leading rebounder in Cavalier history with 944. ==Professional career== Atlanta Hawks (2012‚Äì2017) Scott with the Hawks in April 2015 On June 28, 2012, Scott was selected by the Atlanta Hawks with the 43rd overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft. On September 6, 2012, he signed with the Hawks. On December 1, 2012, he was assigned to the Bakersfield Jam of the NBA Development League. He was recalled by the Hawks on December 11, reassigned on March 1, and recalled again on March 6. On February 22, 2014, Scott scored a career-high 30 points in a 107‚Äì98 win over the New York Knicks. He became a primary scoring option off the bench for the Hawks in 2013‚Äì14, averaging a career-high 9.6 points per game on the season. On August 26, 2014, Scott re- signed with the Hawks. On March 14, 2015, he was ruled out indefinitely after suffering a left toe injury against the Denver Nuggets three days earlier. He missed 11 games with the injury, returning to action on April 4 against the Brooklyn Nets. After getting arrested in July 2015 for drug possession, many believed Scott would be cut by the Hawks. With his legal process still pending, Atlanta chose to keep Scott on the roster for the 2015‚Äì16 season. He shot a career-best 3-point percentage during the year, reaching as high as 40.9%. On October 31, 2016, Scott was ruled out for four weeks while undergoing a series of non-surgical procedures for his left knee soreness. During the 2016‚Äì17 season, he had three assignments to the NBA Development League, two with the Long Island Nets and one with the Delaware 87ers. On February 23, 2017, Scott was traded, along with the rights to Cenk Akyol and cash considerations, to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for a top-55 protected 2017 second-round pick. He was waived by the Suns the following day. Washington Wizards (2017‚Äì2018) On July 9, 2017, Scott signed with the Washington Wizards. Los Angeles Clippers (2018‚Äì2019) On July 9, 2018, Scott signed with the Los Angeles Clippers. Philadelphia 76ers (2019‚Äìpresent) On February 6, 2019, Scott was traded, along with Tobias Harris and Boban Marjanoviƒá, to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet and a number of future draft picks. On June 30, Scott re-signed with the 76ers for two years on a deal worth $9.8 million. ==NBA career statistics== Regular season -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Atlanta  40  1  9.4  .476  .000  .768  2.8  .3  .1  .1  4.6 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Atlanta  80  6  18.5  .479  .310  .780  3.6  .9  .4  .1  9.6 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Atlanta  68  0  16.5  .444  .344  .792  2.9  1.1  .4  .0  7.8 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Atlanta  75  0  15.3  .468  .392  .794  2.7  1.0  .3  .2  6.2 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Atlanta  18  0  10.8  .293  .148  .875  2.1  .9  .2  .2  2.5 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Washington  76  1  18.5  .527  .405  .658  3.3  1.1  .3  .1  8.8 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  L.A.

The vehicle originally had been stopped for following too closely in Banks County, Georgia on Interstate 85 northeast of Atlanta; the vehicle failed to yield for about two miles, with speeds reaching 98 mph, before it finally pulled over. Scott was facing a possible 25-year prison sentence for his drug charges. On May 2, 2017, a Georgia superior court issued a ruling to suppress all evidence and dismiss the felony drug case against Scott and his brother, largely based upon testimony and evidence that suggested a pattern of racial profiling by law enforcement in the county. ==References * Virginia Cavaliers bio * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:African-American basketball players Category:All-American college men's basketball players Category:American men's basketball players Category:Atlanta Hawks draft picks Category:Atlanta Hawks players Category:Bakersfield Jam players Category:Basketball players from Virginia Category:Delaware 87ers players Category:Long Island Nets players Category:Los Angeles Clippers players Category:Philadelphia 76ers players Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:Sportspeople from Chesapeake, Virginia Category:Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball players Category:Washington Wizards players ","title":"Mike Scott (basketball)"},{"id":"35246098","text":"Respiratory Care Week is a week set to honor and recognize respiratory therapists.

Contested over 500 laps, it was the sixth race of the 2012 season. Ryan Newman of Stewart-Haas Racing took his first win of the season, A. J. Allmendinger finished second and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. finished third. ==Report== Background Martinsville Speedway, the race track where the race was held. Martinsville Speedway is one of five short tracks to hold NASCAR races. The standard track at Martinsville Speedway is a four-turn short track oval that is long. The track's turns are banked at eleven degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is banked at zero degrees. The back stretch also has a zero degree banking. The racetrack has seats for 63,000 spectators. Before the race, Greg Biffle led the Drivers' Championship with 195 points, and Kevin Harvick stood in second with 188. Dale Earnhardt, Jr. followed in third with 178 points, one ahead of Tony Stewart and three ahead of Martin Truex, Jr. in fourth and fifth. Matt Kenseth, with 173, was two points ahead of Denny Hamlin in seventh. Clint Bowyer, with 157 points, was one point ahead of Jimmie Johnson and two ahead of Ryan Newman in ninth and tenth. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet was leading with 33 points, four points ahead of Ford. Toyota, with 27 points, was six points ahead of Dodge in the battle for third. Harvick is the race's defending race winner after winning it in 2011. Practice and qualifying Kasey Kahne won the pole for race. Two practice sessions were held before the race on Friday, both lasting 90 minutes each. Jeff Gordon was quickest with a time of 19.512 seconds in the first session, less than two-hundredths of a second faster than Kyle Busch. Hamlin was just off Burton's pace, followed by Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Newman, and Martin Truex, Jr. Stewart was seventh, still within two- tenths of a second of Gordon's time. In the second and final practice session, Gordon was quickest with a time of 19.516 seconds. Kurt Busch followed in the second position, ahead of Brad Keselowski, Newman, and David Stremme. Landon Cassill was sixth after posting a time of 19.844 seconds, while Josh Wise and Juan Pablo Montoya followed in seventh and eighth. Scott Riggs and Aric Almirola rounded out the first ten positions. Forty-six cars are entered for qualifying, but only forty-three raced because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. ==Results== Qualifying {  style=\\"font- size:95%\\" - ! Grid ! ! Driver ! Team !

In the later midrashic literature he is called Yitzchak Nappaha, whereas the older works call him only R. Yitzchak. In the Babylonian Talmud he is identified with various other Yitzchaks,Pesachim 113b and since that was due to the arbitrary action of a later amora, the real name of his father can no longer be determined. Regarding the name \\"Nappaha\\" (the smith), there had been an older Yitzchak of the same name,Alfred J. Kolatch, Who's who in the Talmud- 1964 Isaac Nappaha An older, wealthy Amora, named Isaac, is sometimes confused with Isaac Nappaha. who was rich and who is said to have owned five courts in Usha. It has not yet been possible, however, to ascertain any relationship between the two. If the elder was an ancestor of this Yitzchak, the younger could well have inherited the name without ever having practised the trade. ==Biography== He was a pupil of Johanan bar Nappaha.Alfred J. Kolatch Who's who in the Talmud 1964 \\"Isaac Nappaha A Palestinian Amora of the third and fourth centuries who was a pupil of Johanan\\" Reish Lakish once used the similarity in their names as the material for wordplay.Sanhedrin 96a Isaac's daughter married the Babylonian amora Pappi.Hullin 110a Tradition records him teaching in Antioch.Markus N. A. Bockmuehl Jewish law in gentile churches - Halakah and the Beginning of Christian Public Ethics. Grand Rapids: Baker, 2003, Page 54 \\"Indeed, Antioch continued for several centuries to serve as a place of residence for important religious leaders; even in the Amoraic period famous Rabbis like Simlai and Isaac Nappaha are sometimes cited as teaching in the city.\\" Although he was a pupil of Johanan bar Nappaha, his associations with Johanan are indicated in only one passage, which tells of his once appearing before Johanan.Bava Metziah 24b As a traditionist of the aggadah of Johanan, he appears only in the Babylonian Talmud.Berachot 62b He was in Babylonia only temporarily, probably soon after the death of Johanan; and while there he visited the house of the exilarch,Moed Kattan 24b together with Rav Sheshet and Rav Yosef.Rosh Hashana 3b; Shabbat 52b Rava quoted in his name;Berachot 32a; Temurah 15a but sometimes tradition maintains that it is uncertain whether the sayings originated with Yitzchak or with Rava.Sanhedrin 94a; Nedarim 39a; Nazir 23b Rabbin bar Adda also cites in his name.Berachot 6a; Pesachim 8b His home was originally in Caesarea, but he afterward went to Tiberias to live. He associated intimately with Rabbi Ammi, with whom he often discussed halakhic questions;Sotah 34a; Menachot 11b; Hagigah 26a; Berachot 41a; Yoma 42b and together they sometimes rendered decisions in matters pertaining to religious law.Hullin 48b; Nedarim 57b; Berachot 27a Yitzchak, Abbahu, and Hanina b. Papi constituted a board of judges.Ketuvot 84b; Avodah Zarah 39b; Berachot 38a,b; Bava Kamma 117b; Gittin 29b Rabbi Helbo referred to Yitzchak two liturgical questions addressed to him from Galilee: the first question he answered immediately; the second he expounded publicly in the academy.Gittin 60a A thesis on the creation of light, formulated anonymously, was made public by R. Yitzchak.Genesis Rabbah 3, beginning He also engaged in aggadic discussions with Levi II;Genesis Rabbah 19:14; Pesikta Rabbati 23, beginning; Berachot 4a; Yerushalmi Ta'anit 65b with Abba bar Kahana;Genesis Rabbah 43:7; Leviticus Rabbah 2:1; Midrash Tehillim to Psalms 49:1 with Rabbi Aha;Pesikta Rabbati 15; Genesis Rabbah 5:7; Yerushalmi Pe'ah 1:1 15d and with Hiyya bar Abba.Leviticus Rabbah 20:7; Pesikta Rabbati 22 Among those who transmitted in the name of Yitzchak were the famous halakhist Haggai, the latter's sons Jonathan and Azariah,Genesis Rabbah 22:18, 40:6; Midrash Shmuel 22,end and Luliani ben Tabrin.Genesis Rabbah passim; Midrash Tehillim to Psalms 24:4; Yerushalmi Megillah 75c ==Teachings== That Yitzchak was a great authority on halakhah, as well as aggadah, is shown by an anecdote which is told and according to which Ammi and Assi would not let him speak, because the one wished to hear halakhah and the other aggadah.Bava Kamma 60b So after telling them the celebrated story (also known from Aesop's Fables) of the man who had two wives, one of whom pulled out all his white hairs because she was young, whereas the other extracted his black hairs because she was old, R. Yitzchak presented to them an aggadah with a halakhic background, in order to satisfy both at the same time. However, Yitzchak devoted himself to aggadah with more zeal, because he regarded it as a necessity in the adverse circumstances of the Jews. The poverty of the Jews of Palestine had increased to such an extent that people no longer waited for the harvest, but ate the green ears of wheat;Genesis Rabbah 20:24 consequently they were in need of comfort and refreshment of soul.Pesachim 101b Yitzchak tried to make his lectures as effective as possible, and they show him to have been an unusually forceful rhetorician and a skillful exegete. Yitzchak's aggadic material may be divided according to contents into the following four groups: #Proverbs and dicta: concerning sins;Sukkah 52a,b; Hagigah 16a; Kiddushin 31a; Berachot 25a; Rosh Hashana 16b; Yoma 87a; Bava Batra 9b; Pesachim 90b concerning the relation of man to God;Nedarim 32a; Sotah 48b; Ruth Rabbah 1:2 on the relation of man to his fellow beings;Bava Metziah 42a; Megillah 28a; Bava Kamma 93a concerning prayer;Pesachim 56a; Leviticus Rabbah 30:3; Midrash Shmuel 1:7; Rosh Hashana 16b; Yerushalmi Kiddushin 61b; Yerushalmi Nedarim 41b concerning study and the Law;Megillah 6b; Leviticus Rabbah 2:1; Sanhedrin 21b, 24a; Hullin 91a; Yoma 77a concerning Israel;Genesis Rabbah 63:8 concerning the nations;Esther Rabbah 1:10; Leviticus Rabbah 1:14; Exodus Rabbah 38:3 concerning Jerusalem.Pesikta Rabbati 41:1; Pesachim 8a #Exegesis: general;Sanhedrin 82a, 89a, 95b; Temurah 16a; Yerushalmi Rosh Hashana 57c; Genesis Rabbah 53:20; Hullin 91b; Sotah 48b; Bava Batra 16a halakhic;Berachot 13b; Gittin 59b; Pesachim 31b; Yoma 77a; Yerushalmi Sotah 17a Biblical personages;Genesis Rabbah 34:11, 39:7, 58:7; Yebamot 64a Biblical narrativesSotah 34a; Deuteronomy Rabbah 11:2; Bava Batra 91a; Midrash Tehillim to Psalms 7:13; Sanhedrin 106b; Menachot 53b; Esther Rabbah 3:9; Pesikta Rabbati 35:1 #HomileticsGenesis Rabbah 19:6, 38:7; Sanhedrin 96a; Bava Metziah 87a; Yerushalmi Sotah 17b; Exodus Rabbah 43:4; Sanhedrin 102a; Berachot 63b; Ecclesiastes Rabbah 3:19; Temurah 16a; Yerushalmi Ta'anit 65b; Horayot 10b #Proems;Genesis Rabbah 3:1, 59:2, 65:7; Exodus Rabbah 32:5; Leviticus Rabbah 12:2 maxims;Genesis Rabbah 56:1; Deuteronomy Rabbah 2:27; Leviticus Rabbah 34:8 similes;Yerushalmi Rosh Hashana 57b; Leviticus Rabbah 5:6; Exodus Rabbah 15:16; Yerushalmi Berachot 13a; Bava Batra 74b messianic subjects;Ecclesiastes Rabbah 1:11; Deuteronomy Rabbah 1:19; Avodah Zarah 3b eschatologyLeviticus Rabbah 13:3; Midrash Tehillim to Psalms 49:1; Shabbat 152a; Bava Metziah 83b The calendar According to the unanimous testimony of several writers of the tenth century, the gaon Hai b. David ascribed to Yitzchak Nappaha the calculation of the Rabbinite calendar. Karaite tradition, borrowed from the Rabbanites, credits Isaac with declaring new months not by observing the moon, but like the Rabbanites computing according to the rule of lo, bet, dalet, waw which meant that Passover can never begin on a Monday, or a Wednesday, or a Friday.Moshe Gil, David Strassler Jews in Islamic countries in the Middle Ages Page 224 - 2004 \\"The Karaite tradition (evidently borrowed from the Rabbanites) about R. Isaac Nappaha ('the smith'): \\"....the accepted custom was to fix the beginning of ..month by observing the moon, but they (the Rabbanites) began fixing the compute according to the rule of lo, bet, dalet, waw (ie, that the Passover shall never begin on a Monday, or a Wednesday, or a Friday), whose origin is unknown.. This is the method invented by Isaac Nappaha,.. \\" ==References== It has the following bibliography: * Bacher, Ag. Pal.

Rajoana was sentenced to death on 1 August 2007 by a special CBI court in Chandigarh. Beant Singh was killed by Balwant Singh's associate Dilawar Singh Babbar and Balwant Singh was the backup human bomb to be used had Dilawar failed in his mission. ==Early years== Balwant Singh was born in Rajoana Kalan village near Raikot in Ludhiana district of Punjab in a Sikh family on 23 August 1967. As a child, he was fond of reading ghazals, novels and poetry. The works of Surjit Paatar and Jaswant Singh Kanwal played an important role in shaping his ideology. ==Assassination of Beant Singh== In Punjab between 1992 and 1995, at a time when the Khalistan separatist movement was active in the state and the Indian government was aggressively seeking to control the movement. It is alleged that, during Beant Singh's tenure, upwards of twenty-five thousand of Sikh civilians disappeared or were killed and their bodies cremated by the police in extrajudicial executions. Rajoana, who was a police constable at that time, conspired with Dilawar Singh Jaisinghvala, a police officer, to kill Beant Singh. Based on a coin toss, Dilawar Singh Jaisinghvala was chosen to be the suicide bomber with Rajoana as a backup. The attack on 31 August 1995 resulted in the death of Beant Singh and 17 others, and, on 25 December 1997, Rajoana confessed his involvement. == Conviction and death sentence == Balwant Singh had \\"openly confessed\\" an involvement and strongly expressed no faith in Indian judiciary. He refused to defend himself and refused to take a lawyer. He accused Indian courts of applying dual standards of law and the Indian judicial system of shielding the culprits of 1984 anti-Sikh riots. \\"Asking for mercy from them (Indian courts) is not even in my distant dreams\\" Rajoana said in an open letter to Media. Explaining his actions, Balwant Singh referred to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and talked about how the perpetrators had not been punished even after 25 years. In a letter to the Chief Justice of the High Court, he complained about discrimination at the hands of the country's judicial system and the rulers.Why Balwant Singh Rajoana never appealed against his death sentence Rajoana defended his actions citing the 1984 Operation Blue Star offensive at the Golden Temple and the killing of Sikhs during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Rajoana was sentenced to death by a special CBI court and his execution was scheduled for 31 March 2012. In his will, Balwant Singh said that his wish was to donate his eyes to Lakhwinder Singh (Ragi at Golden Temple Amritsar) and his kidneys, heart or any other body part to needy patients. On 28 March 2012 India's Home Ministry stayed the execution following clemency appeals filed by the SGPC, a Sikh organization. On stay of his execution, Balwant singh said, \\"I have dedicated my life to the Panth(referred to Khalsa and meaning the Sikh Nation) and have no regrets. So the stay doesn't make any difference to me\\". He also added, \\"This is a victory of real Khalsa Panth after every member of the Sikh Nation rose to the occasion and successfully conveyed the strength of the Khalsa religion. I am ready to be hanged at any time and will live as long as God has decided for me. My happiness over the stay shouldn't be considered as my weakness. I am happy because Sikh nation has shocked the walls of the Delhi government, not because my hanging has been postponed.\\" NDP Justice Critic, Jagmeet Singh,Jagmeet Singh stood up in the Ontario legislature and suggested Ontario use its trade relations as a bargaining chip to save the backup suicide bomber Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Tuesday said in Lok Sabha that death sentence of Balwant Singh Rajoana, a convict in the assassination case of former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh, has not been commuted. \\"The sentence has not been commuted,\\" he told the Parliamentarians in the Lower House today. Shah also urged the fellow members to not to go by media reports which have stated that the ministry has recommended commuting the death sentence of Rajoana and the communication had been sent to Punjab government and Chandigarh administration. Shah made the remarks after the matter was raised by the Congress members and the grandson of late Beant Singh, Ravneet Singh Bittu during the question hour in the lower house. Bittu said that the members on Monday had demanded death sentence for those convicted in heinous cases against women but Rajoana's death sentence was sought to be commuted. He also sought a response from the Home Minister. (ANI) . == Awards == On 23 March 2012, he was awarded the title of \\"Living Martyr\\" by Akal Takhat, the highest temporal seat of the Khalsa. Rajoana initially refused to accept the title, but later on 27 March, he accepted the title, saying that it will make him \\"more determined\\" towards his goals. Dilawar Singh Babbar was also awarded the title of \\"National Martyr\\" in the same order from Akal Takhat. == References == Category:Indian Sikhs Category:Living people Category:Khalistan movement people Category:People from Punjab, India Category:Punjabi people Category:Prisoners sentenced to death by India Category:1967 births Category:Indian prisoners sentenced to death Category:Indian people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by India Category:Suicide bombers in the Punjab insurgency Category:Insurgency in Punjab ","title":"Balwant Singh Rajoana"},{"id":"35246439","text":"The Lacon Bridge crosses the Illinois River in the community of Lacon, Illinois.

Retrieved April 3, 2006. The \\"Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts\\" that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard de facto set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country. Rounds WXC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or is a fight card's \\"main event\\" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes. Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-championship \\"main event\\" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card), will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Bouts which re either on the preliminary card, or on the main card prior to the main event, last for a maximum of three rounds. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.

The WXC cage is a hexagon structure with walls of metal chain-link fence coated with black vinyl and a diameter of , allowing of space from side to side. The fence is to high. The cage sits atop a platform, raising it from the ground. It has foam padding around the top of the fence and between each of the six sections. It also has two entry-exit gates opposite each other. The mat, painted with sponsorship logos and art, is replaced for each event. Attire All competitors must fight in approved shorts, without shoes. Shirts, gis or long pants (including gi pants) are not allowed. Fighters must use approved light-weight open- fingered gloves, that include at least 1\\" of padding around the knuckles, (110 to 170 g / 4 to 6 ounces) that allow fingers to grab. These gloves enable fighters to punch with less risk of an injured or broken hand, while retaining the ability to grab and grapple. A mouthguard and jockstrap with protective cup are also required and is checked by a State Athletic Committee official before being allowed to enter the cage/ring. Match outcome *Submission: a fighter clearly taps the mat or his opponent, or verbally submits. Also a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of serious injury while in a hold. *Knockout: a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike. *Technical Knockout (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories: **referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is unable to intelligently defend himself) **doctor stoppage (a ring side doctor decides that it is unsafe for the fighter to continue the bout due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries) **corner stoppage (a fighter's cornerman signals defeat for their own fighter) *Judges' Decision: Depending on scoring, a match may end as: **unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A) **majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw) **split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B) **unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw) **majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win) **split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw) Note: In the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total points be equal. However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of win judgments from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). A fight can also end in a technical decision, technical submission, disqualification, forfeit, technical draw, or no contest. The latter two outcomes have no winners. Judging criteria The ten-point must system is in effect for all WXC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points, the loser nine points or fewer. Scores of 10‚Äì8 are typically awarded for very dominant rounds. Fouls #Butting with the head #Eye gouging of any kind #Biting #Hair pulling #Fish hooking #Groin attacks of any kind #Putting a finger into any orifice or into any cut or laceration on an opponent (see Fish-hooking) #Small joint manipulation #Striking to the spine or the back of the head (see Rabbit punch) #Striking downward using the point of the elbow (see Elbow (strike)) #Throat strikes of any kind, including, without limitation, grabbing the trachea #Clawing, pinching or twisting the flesh #Grabbing the clavicle #Kicking the head of a grounded opponent #Kneeing the head of a grounded opponent #Stomping a grounded opponent #Kicking to the kidney with the heel #Spiking an opponent to the canvas on his head or neck (see Piledriver) #Throwing an opponent out of the ring or fenced area #Holding the shorts or gloves of an opponent #Spitting at an opponent #Engaging in unsportsmanlike conduct that causes an injury to an opponent #Holding the ropes or the fence #Using abusive language in the ring or fenced area #Attacking an opponent on or during the break #Attacking an opponent who is under the care of the referee #Attacking an opponent after the bell (horn) has sounded the end of a round #Flagrantly disregarding the instructions of the referee #Timidity, including, without limitation, avoiding contact with an opponent, intentionally or consistently dropping the mouthpiece or faking an injury #Interference by the corner #Throwing in the towel during competition When a foul is charged, the referee in their discretion may deduct one or more points as a penalty. If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw. Match conduct *After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant position or working towards one). This rule is codified in Nevada as the stand-up rule. *If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions. *Grabbing the cage brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the cage, the referee may charge a foul. *Early WXC events disregarded verbal sparring / \\"trash-talking\\" during matches. Under unified rules, antics are permitted before events to add to excitement and allow fighters to express themselves, but abusive language during combat is prohibited. Fighter salaries A WXC fighter generally does not have a salary, Amateur fighters do not get paid. Professional fighters are paid per fight, with amounts depending on how well-known the fighters are and how well sponsored a fighter and an event is. Fighters will typically get paid money to fight with an additional bonus if they win. Cash bonuses are also typically awarded for \\"Fight of the Night\\", \\"Knockout of the Night\\", and \\"Submission of the Night.\\" The size of these bonuses varies by event, but, for less well-known fighters, they can be several times larger than the contracted amount for the fight. ==Media== Music *WXC: Xtreme Beat Downs, Vol. 1, an album of music featured in and inspired by the WXC.

An anonymous donor provided an unusual silver cup, known as the ‚ÄòJubilee Cup‚Äô, which Celtic Camogie Club were allowed to keep. ==Arrangements== The championship was organised to mark the Diamond Jubilee of the Camogie Association and followed the traditional provincial system used in Gaelic Games since the 1880s, with Glen Rovers and Newport winning the championships of the other two provinces. Clubs that had won their county championship were eligible to enter the provincial club championship. ==Semi-finals== To the fury of the organizers, Newport failed to travel to Belfast for the semi-final. Celtic arrived for the semi-final at Ballinlough to find that no camogie goalposts were available. After some debate, the match went ahead on the full-sized hurling pitch. Celtic led 4‚Äì1 to 0‚Äì2 at half time. Glen were inspired by Peggy Dorgan at midfield in the second half, equalised with five minutes to go, and forced the match to a replay. In the replay, things looked bad for Celtic when Glen Rovers led by four points with ten minutes to go, Una O'Connor retired with a head injury and Celtic substitute Kit Kehoe celebrated her arrival on the field by first-timing the ball in the direction of her own goal. Luckily for Celtic, Eithne Leech was alert and coped with the unexpected shot. Kit Kehoe then raced to the dropping puck out and doubled on the ball for a goal at the correct end, and followed up by scoring a second with a powerful drive a few minutes later which Deirdre Sutton could not hold and dropped over the line. They added a point on full- time for a three points win. ==The Final== Celtic led 2-2 at half time against a Deirdre side that was over-dependent on Sue Ward. A great Sue Ward goal from a 30 proved too late to make much difference. Una O'Connor scored three goals and Mary O'Keeffe two more as Celtic claimed the Jubilee Cup and were allowed to keep it permanently. Agnes Hourigan wrote in the Irish Press: > The main factor in Dublin‚Äôs victory was their solid defence which was built > around All-Ireland star Alice Hussey who gave a memorable display at centre > back never relaxed its grip on Deridre‚Äôs attack and was as effective against > the wind after the interval as it had proved in the first half.

Oranmore refused to play extra time and were granted a replay after an investigation into whether the respective team captains had been notified of the extra time arrangement in advance. The perception was that Oranmore, who led by four points with five minutes to go, had most to lose from the replay, Eoghan Rua having come back with a goal from Dolores Barber and a point from a 30 from Margaret O'Leary seconds from time.Report of final in Irish Press, November 6, 1967Report of final in Irish Independent, November 6, 1967Report of final in Irish Times, November 6, 1967 Agnes Hourigan wrote in the Irish Press: > There was an unsatisfactory ending to an All-Ireland Club camogie > championship final at Parnell Park when, after the game ende din a draw, > Galway champions Oranmore did not come out to play extra time.

Women's Health Center, Inc., 512 U.S. 753 (1994), is a United States Supreme Court case where Petitioners challenged the constitutionality of an injunction entered by a Florida state court which prohibits antiabortion protesters from demonstrating in certain places and in various ways outside of a health clinic that performs abortions.. The Petitioners, Madsen and other abortion protesters (Petitioners) regularly protested the Respondents, the Women‚Äôs Health Center and other abortion clinics (Respondent), in Melbourne, Florida. The Respondents then sought and was granted, by a Florida trial court, an injunction on several grounds, restraining the Petitioner‚Äôs ability to protest, which was upheld by the Florida Supreme Court. The Petitioner‚Äôs appeal to the United States Supreme Court claimed that the injunction restricted their rights to free speech under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. == Background ==  Facts  The Petitioners protest abortion clinics run by Respondents. The Petitioners picketed and demonstrated where the public street gives access to the clinic. The Petitioners have been permanently enjoined by a Florida court from blocking or interfering with public access to the clinic and from physically abusing persons entering or leaving the clinic. Six months later, the Respondents sought to broaden the injunction, complaining that the Petitioners still impede potential patients. The trial court then issued a broader injunction, for which the Petitioners challenge as a violation of their First Amendment constitutional rights. The Amendment injunction prohibits the Petitioners from entering the premises of the Respondents, blocking or impeding access to the Respondents‚Äô premises, from picketing and demonstrating or entering a portion of public right of way or private property within 36 feet of the property line of the Clinic, from causing excess noise from 7:30 am to noon Monday thru Saturday when procedures and recovery periods occur, from physically approaching or causing noise within 300 feet of any of the Respondents‚Äô employees homes, from harassing anyone trying to gain access Respondents‚Äô clinic, from displaying certain objectionable images and from inciting others to commit any of these prohibited acts. Upon appeal the Florida Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the injunction, causing the Petitioners to appeal. The petitioners in Madsen v. Women's Health Center, Inc. were members of Operation Rescue America (hereinafter Operation Rescue), a group whose goal is to close down abortion clinics throughout the country. The Aware Woman Center for Choice, operated by the Women's Health Center, Inc., a women's health care clinic, provided abortions and counseling to its clients. Members of Operation Rescue engaged in picketing and demonstrations in front of and around the clinic, essentially blocking the entrance to the clinic. The members of Operation Rescue were extremely open about their intent to have the clinics incapacitated. They stated to the press that they intended to shut down a clinic. The literature of the organization stated that \\"their members should ignore the law of the State and the police officers who remove them from their blockading positions.\\" Women's Health Center, Inc., brought an action for injunctive relief prohibiting Operation Rescue members from engaging in these activities.  Issues  * Whether the State has a significant state interest enabling it to restrict the Petitioners‚Äô First Amendment constitutional rights? * Whether the 36 foot buffer zone around the clinic entrances and driveway are constitutional restrictions on the Petitioners‚Äô First Amendment constitutional rights? * Whether the 36 foot provision as applied to private property around the clinic is a constitutional restriction on the Petitioners‚Äô First Amendment constitutional rights? * Whether the noise prohibition provision of the injunction is a constitutional restriction on the Petitioners‚Äô First Amendment constitutional rights? * Whether the images observable prohibition is a constitutional restriction of the Petitioners‚Äô First Amendment constitutional rights? * Whether the 300-foot no approach zone around the clinic and residences is a permissible restriction of the Petitioners‚Äô First Amendment constitutional rights? == Opinion of the Court ==  Majority opinion  Justice William Rehnquist authored the majority opinion for Madsen v. Women's Health Center, Inc. The Madsen majority sustained the constitutionality of the Clinic's thirty-six foot buffer zone and the noise-level provision, finding that they burdened no more speech than necessary to serve the injunction's goals. However, the Court struck down the thirty-six foot buffer zone as applied to the private property north and west of the Clinic, .the 'images observable' provision, the three hundred foot no- approach zone around the Clinic, and the three hundred foot buffer zone around residences. The Court found that these provisions \\" [swept] more broadly than necessary\\" to protect the state's interests. Thus, the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court was affirmed in part and reversed in part.  Regular concurrence  Justice Souter, concurring. I join the Court's opinion and write separately only to clarify two matters in the record. First, the trial judge made reasonably clear that the issue of who was acting \\"in concert\\" with the named defendants was a matter to be taken up in *777 individual cases, and not to be decided on the basis of protesters' viewpoints. See Tr. 40, 43, 93, 115, 119-120 (Apr. 12, 1993, Hearing). Second, petitioners themselves acknowledge that the governmental interests in protection of public safety and order, of the free flow of traffic, and of property rights are reflected in Florida law. See Brief for Petitioners 17, and n. 7 (citing, e.g., Fla. Stat. ¬ß¬ß 870.041-870.047 (1991) (public peace); ¬ß 316.2045 (obstruction of public streets, highways, and roads)).  Special concurrence  Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting in part. The certiorari petition presented three questions, corresponding to petitioners' three major challenges to the trial court's injunction.[1] The Court correctly and unequivocally rejects petitioners' argument that the injunction is a \\"content-based restriction on free speech,\\" ante, at 762-764, as well as their challenge to the injunction on the basis that it applies to persons acting \\"in concert\\" with them, ante, at 775-776. I therefore join Parts II and IV of the Court's opinion, which properly dispose of the first and third questions presented. I part company with the Court, however, on its treatment of the second question presented, including its enunciation of the applicable standard of review.  Dissenting opinion  Concludes that under the circumstances the prohibition against physically approaching in the 300-foot zone around the clinic withstands the Petitioners‚Äô First Amendment constitutional challenge. This is because the Petitioners‚Äô ‚Äúcounseling‚Äù of the clinic‚Äôs patients is a form of expression analogous to labor picketing. It is a mixture of content and communication. Just as the First Amendment of the Constitution protects the speaker‚Äôs right to offer ‚Äúsidewalk counseling‚Äù to all passersby. That protection, however, does not encompass attempts to abuse an unreceptive or captive audience, at least under the circumstances in this case. The dissent also feels that the injunction generally should be no more burdensome than necessary to provide complete relief. Therefore, standards fashioned to determine the constitutionality of statutes should not be used to evaluate injunctions. The injunction in this case departs so far from the established jurisprudence of the Supreme Court that in any other context it would have been regarded as a candidate for summary reversal. But since this decision deals with abortion, no legal rule or doctrine is safe from ad hoc nullification by the Supreme Court when an occasion for its application arises in a case involving state regulation of abortion. The dissent believes that the 36 foot speech-free zone did not meet the burden for the test the Supreme Court set, as it burdens more speech than necessary. The dissent charges that speech-restricting injunctions are deserving of strict scrutiny by the Supreme Court and that the Supreme Court did not award it this level of review in this case and therefore dissents from all portions of the judgment upholding the injunction.  Held  Refer to above Issues *Yes. - The State has a strong interest in protecting a woman‚Äôs freedom to seek lawful medical or counseling services in connection with her pregnancy. The State also has an interest in ensuring public safety, and public order, in promoting the free flow of traffic on its streets and sidewalks. The State also has a strong interest in protecting residential privacy. The combination of which is sufficient to justify an appropriately tailored injunction to protect them. *Yes. - The 36-foot buffer zone around the clinic entrances and driveway burdens no more speech than necessary to accomplish the governmental interest at stake. *No. - The 36-foot buffer zone on private property around the clinic burdens more speech than necessary to protect access to the clinic, as nothing in the record indicates that the Petitioners‚Äô activities on the private property have obstructed access to the clinic. *Yes. - The limited noise restrictions limit no more speech than necessary to ensure the health and well-being of the patients at the clinic. The First Amendment of the Constitution does not demand that patients at a medical facility undertake Herculean efforts to escape the cacophony of political protests. *No. - The images observable provision in the injunction limits more speech than necessary to achieve the purpose of limiting threats to clinic patients or their families. It is much easier for the clinic to pull its curtains than for a patient to stop up her ears, and no more is required to avoid seeing placards through the windows of the clinic. Therefore, this provision is an unconstitutional restriction because of the availability of this less restrictive means. *No. - The record before the Supreme Court does not contain sufficient justification for this broad ban on picketing, it appears that a limitation, on the time, duration of picketing, and number of pickets outside a smaller zone could have accomplished the desired result, while placing a lesser restriction on the Petitioners‚Äô First Amendment constitutional rights. == References  * Category:1994 in United States case law Category:Melbourne, Florida Category:United States Free Speech Clause case law Category:United States reproductive rights case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court ","title":"Madsen v.

In 2014, they won the Mercury Prize for their album Dead. ==History== Formed in Edinburgh in 2008 by Alloysious Massaquoi, Kayus Bankole and Graham 'G' Hastings, the group started performing in nightclubs when the band members were all in their teens. In 2012, they signed to LA-based label Anticon and released their introductory mixtapes, Tape One and Tape Two, with Tape Two winning the Scottish Album of the Year Award (\\"The SAY Award\\"). The trio then signed to Big Dada and released their debut album, Dead, which was released in 2014. The album gained a lot of critical attention and went on to win the prestigious Mercury Prize. Dead entered the UK albums chart at the 35th position and topped the independent UK album chart. Following an extensive world tour the band decamped to Berlin to begin work on their second album, White Men Are Black Men Too, which was released in April 2015. In 2016, the band were invited to support Massive Attack on their UK and European tour after working together on Massive Attack's single \\"Voodoo in My Blood\\", taken from their Ritual Spirit EP, which was released in January 2016. In June 2017 Young Fathers played in the Royal Festival Hall at the Southbank Centre as part of M.I.A.'s Meltdown Festival. Six tracks on the T2 Trainspotting soundtrack feature Young Fathers, including \\"Only God Knows\\", written specifically for the film. In a statement the director Danny Boyle described the song as \\"the heartbeat for the film\\". Young Fathers' third studio album, Cocoa Sugar, was announced with the single \\"In My View\\" on 17 January 2018. The album was released on British independent label Ninja Tune on 9 March 2018. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 28, making it the band's highest- charting album. Due to their support of the BDS movement, the band was dropped from the 2018 Ruhrtriennale line-up.

Anthropologists identify them as objects referenced in emic accounts that represent indigenous beliefs. Tsentak are not recognized in scientific medicine. Shaman from an equatorial Amazonian forest, June 2006 __TOC__ ==Etymology== The term tsentsak is derived from the Shuar language, which belongs to the Jivaroan language family. The Shuar are members of the Jivaroan peoples who reside in the Amazon rainforest of Peru and Ecuador. This term is also used interchangeably with virote (primarily by mestizo shamans), a Spanish term for crossbow bolt which was applied to the blow darts made by the Jivaroans from the spines of the Bactris and Astrocaryum palms.Beyer 2009, pg. 84 ==Use == Tsentsak are stored by the shaman in his or her yachay, or phlegm, located in the chest and stomach. The tsentsak are embedded within this phlegm and either the tsentsak or the yachay may be projected out of the shaman into a victim to cause illness and death. This phlegm is the materialization of the shaman's power; it is used to remove tsentsak from the bodies of victims as well as to protect the shaman from being harmed by the tsentsak of others. Tsentsak are only visible under the influence of a psychoactive substance called natem√§, which is the J√≠varo word for ayahuasca.Harner 1973, pg. 17 When the shaman imbibes natem√§, the world of spirits becomes visible. It is at this time that sorcerers and bewitching shamans can send tsentsak to their victims, while conversely, healers and curing shamans can remove tsentsak from their afflicted patients. Tsentsak are believed to possess their own agency and volition as living spirits that constantly desire to kill and consume human flesh.Beyer 2009, pg. 85 A shaman must learn to control their darts lest they escape and cause unintended harm. To facilitate control of tsentsak they must be nourished by the consumption of mapacho (Nicotiana rustica), which can be smoked or imbibed as an infusion. A shaman who does not possess the necessary restraint to swallow their tsentsak when they rise to the back of their throat will become a sorcerer or bewitching shaman, while a shaman who can learn to control these urges will become a healer or curing shaman.Beyer 2009, pg. 95 An apprentice shaman who receives their first tsentsak from a predominantly bewitching shaman is likely to become a sorcerer, while the apprentice that receives their first tsentsak from a curing shaman will most likely become a healer.Harner 1973, pg. 19 Sorcery Throughout much of the Amazon, tsentsak are believed to be the primary cause of illness and nonviolent death. These magical darts are utilized by brujos, (shamans specializing in attack sorcery) to bring suffering and death to their victims. The darts can be regurgitated at will by the sorcerer and projected from the mouth into the body of the victim. If the dart passes entirely though the victim they will die in three to seven days, however, if the dart becomes lodged in the victim's body, it may be removed by a curing shaman. The shaman can collect plants, insects and many other objects small enough to be swallowed, which he may then convert into tsentsak. Each variety of tsentsak possesses its own specific attributes and degree of ability to cause illness. The amount and variety of tsentsak collected by a shaman is directly proportional to his power and ability to kill and heal. Healing While sorcerers may use tsentsak for malevolent purposes, healing shamans use these magic darts to create a barrier of protection around their body. They also possess the ability to suck tsentsak from the body of a victim, which can then be sent back to the sorcerer from whom it originated. The healing shaman must imbibe ayahuasca to make the darts visible in the victim's body in order to remove them. To remove the malevolent tsentsak the curing shaman must suck it out of the victim's body. In preparation for this act the shaman must first regurgitate two of his own tsentsak into the back of his throat. The first is used to block the shaman from accidentally ingesting the malevolent tsentsak, which would most likely lead to his death. The second is used to absorb or dissolve the malevolent tsentsak which the shaman then spits out or sends back to the sorcerer.Beyer 2009, pg. 86 ==Commodification== A shaman will typically receive his first tsentsak from a practicing shaman to whom he has apprenticed. The practicing shaman will regurgitate some of his yachay containing the tsentsak, which the apprentice must then swallow. The apprentice can then keep the darts in his stomach indefinitely. Many shamans will travel great distances to trade tsentsak with other powerful shamans from distant regions. They may also buy and sell tsentsak to increase the potency of their power. To transfer tsentsak to another individual, both the buyer and seller must consume ayahuasca to make the tsentsak visible. The seller must then drink an infusion of Nicotiana rustica to regurgitate the tsentsak, which is then displayed to the buyer. The buyer then swallows the tsentsak, thereby adding it to his collection. Tsentsak may also be sold in the more tangible forms of tree thorns, insects, small stones, and even pieces of razor blade. ==Dietary and sexual restrictions== In the context of Jivaroan shamanism, an apprentice shaman must abstain from sexual intercourse and follow a special diet for a period of at least three months after receiving their first tsentsak. If these restrictions are broken, the darts will leave the body of the shaman and the process must be started from the beginning. To gain the power to kill and cure, a shaman must observe these restrictions for a period of five months.Harner 1973, pg. 20 Mestizo shamans adhere to a similar restrictive diet in preparation for the consumption of ayahuasca before shamanic rituals. These restrictions help to instill self-control and emotional mastery in preparation for a career as a healer. A shaman who breaks the restrictions cannot control the urges of their tsentsak and will become a sorcerer. ==See also== *Ayahuasca *Jivaroan peoples *Michael Harner *Shamanism *Shuar people *Tsunki *Tutelary deity *Yachay ==NotesReferences== : : : ==External links== * Singing to the Plants Website of Stephan Beyer * Shamanism.org Interview with Michael Harner Category:Anthropology Category:Magic (supernatural) Category:Witchcraft Category:Shamanism of the Americas ","title":"Tsentsak"},{"id":"35246924","text":"{ class=\\"infobox\\" style=\\"font-size: 90%;\\" + Gael Linn Cup 2011 ! style=\\"background: #BFD7FF; text-align: center\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Championship Details - Dates colspan=\\"2\\" - Competitors colspan=\\"2\\" - Sponsor colspan=\\"2\\" - ! style=\\"background: #BFD7FF; text-align: center\\" colspan=\\"3\\" Gael Linn Cup winners - Winners colspan=\\"2\\" Munster (17th junior title) - Captain colspan=\\"2\\" - Manager colspan=\\"2\\" - ! style=\\"background: #BFD7FF; text-align: center\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Gael Linn Cup Runners-up - Runners-up colspan=\\"2\\" Leinster - Captain colspan=\\"2\\" - Manager colspan=\\"2\\" - Matches played colspan=\\"2\\" 3 } The 2011 Gael Linn Cup, the most important representative competition for elite level participants in the women's team field sport of camogie, was played at junior level according to the on a bi-ennial programme devised by congress 2010.

The first ISI operation in Afghanistan took place in 1975. It was in \\"retaliation to Republic of Afghanistan's proxy war and support to the militants against Pakistan\\". Before 1975, ISI did not conduct any operation in Afghanistan and it was only after decade of Republic of Afghanistan's proxy war against Pakistan, support to militants and armed incursion in 1960 and 1961 in Bajaur that Pakistan was forced to retaliate. Later on, in the 1980s, the ISI in Operation Cyclone systematically coordinated the distribution of arms and financial means provided by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to factions of the Afghan mujahideen such as the Hezb-e Islami (HeI) of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and the forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud whose forces would later be known as the Northern Alliance. After the Soviet retreat, the different Mujahideen factions turned on each other and were unable to come to a power sharing deal which resulted in a civil war. The United States, along with the ISI and the Pakistani government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto became the primary source of support for Hekmatyar in his 1992‚Äì1994 bombardment campaign against the Islamic State of Afghanistan and the capital Kabul. It is widely agreed that after Hekmatyar failed to take over power in Afghanistan, the ISI helped to found the Afghan Taliban. The ISI and other parts of the Pakistan military subsequently provided financial, logistical, military and direct combat support to the Taliban until the September 11 attacks of 2001. It is widely acknowledged that the ISI has given the Afghan Taliban safe havens inside Pakistan and supported the Taliban's resurgence in Afghanistan after 9/11 helping them, especially the Haqqani network, carry out attacks inside Afghanistan. Pakistani officials deny this accusation. Allegations have been raised by international government officials, policy analysts and even Pakistani military officials that the ISI in conjunction with the military leadership has also provided some amount of support and refuge to al-Qaeda. Such allegations were increasingly issued when Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was killed in 2011 while living in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad. ==The beginnings : a response to Afghan interference== In his history of the ISI, Hein Kiessling claims that, the Republic of Afghanistan support to anti-Pakistani militants had forced the then prime minister of Pakistan Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Naseerullah Khan Babar, then inspector general of the Frontier Constabulary in NWFP (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), to adopt a more aggressive approach towards Afghanistan. As a result, ISI, under the command of Major General Ghulam Jilani Khan set up a 5,000-strong Afghan guerrilla troop, which would include influential future leaders like Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Burhanuddin Rabbani and Ahmed Shah Masood, to target the Afghan government, the first large operation, in 1975, being the sponsoring of an armed rebellion in the Panjshir valley.Hein Kiessling, Faith, Unity, Discipline: The Inter-Service-Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan, Oxford University Press (2016), p. 34 In a polemical assessment, Afghan feminist Alia Rawi Akbar writes that Massoud, during this uprising, \\"by the order of ISI\\", assassinated the mayor \\"of his home city\\", before he \\"ran to Pakistan.\\"Alia Rawi Akbar, Crises Confronting Afghan Women: Under the Shadow of Terror, Dog Ear Publishing (2010), p. 208 Another historian of the ISI, Owen Sirrs, precises how the 1973 coup d'√©tat which brought president Sardar Mohammed Daoud Khan, a proponent of a Pashtunistan independent state and fiercely anti- Pakistan, helping both Pashtun and Baloch militants, convinced Bhutto to use Islamist rebels in order to fight the ethnic Pashtun or Baloch brands of nationalism, and he described the ISI plan in multiple phases, \\"phase one was stepping up intelligence collection in that country, including ferreting out potential Afghan allies and weaknesses in the Daoud regime. Under phase two ISI operatives contacted the exiled Afghan King in an unsuccessful bid to have him lead an anti-Daoud resistance movement. Phase three involved joint anti- Afghan operations with Iran, since both the Shah and Bhutto regarded the PDPA as a threat to the regional balance of power. Iran‚Äôs intelligence service, SAVAK, backed several anti-Daoud groups unilaterally, but ISI wanted to entice the Iranians into joint missions against the Afghans. The last phase in ISI‚Äôs game plan was also the most important: recruiting an insurgent army from the growing number of anti-Daoud Afghan exiles in Pakistan.\\" These insurgents would include the likes of Ahmed Shah Massoud, Burhanuddin Rabbani, Sibghatullah Mojadeddi, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Jalaleddin Haqqani and Abd al- Rasul Sayyaf, all future political heavyweights of the country.Owen L. Sirrs, Pakistan‚Äôs Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate: Covert action and internal operations, Routledge (2016), pp. 112-113 In 1974, the then prime minister of Pakistan, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto said that: \\"Two can play this game. We know where their weak points are just as they know ours. The Non-Pashtun there hate the Pashtun domination. So we have our ways of persuading Daoud to not aggravate our problems.\\" Abdullah Anas, the leading Afghan Arab and also their key ideologue, in his memoirs says that ISI supported the Tajiks insurgents \\"with the blessing of Pakistan's president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who hoped to use this uprising as a means to pressurise the Afghan government to resolve the border disputes over Baluchistan and Pashtunistan\\", while describing their first military insurrection, in 1975, as \\"a fiasco\\" : Hekmatyar, who remained in Peshawar, sent men to attack government outposts in Surkhrud, without much success, while a second group, led by Massoud, in his native Panjshir valley, took control of government buildings for few days before eventually losing them, as well as many of his men, to Daud Khan's forces, something which irritated him and made him wary of Hekmatyar, blaming him for the failed operation.Abdullah Anas, To the Mountains: My Life in Jihad, from Algeria to Afghanistan, C. Hurst & Co. (2019), pp.28-30 The Pakistani backed rebellion, though unsuccessful, had shaken Daoud Khan to the core and made him realise the gravity of situation. He started softening his stance against Pakistan and started considering to improve relations with Pakistan. He realized that a 'friendly Pakistan was in his interest'. He also accepted Shah of Iran offer to normalize relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. In August 1976, Daoud Khan also recognised Durand Line as international border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. ==Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin== Summary Flag used by Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin In 1979 the Soviet Union intervened in the Afghan Civil War. The ISI and the CIA worked together to recruit Muslims throughout the world to take part in Jihad against the Soviet forces. However the CIA had little direct contact with the Mujahideen as the ISI was the main contact and handler and they favored the most radical of the groups, namely the Hezb-e Islami of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. In 1991, after the Soviets had left Afghanistan, the ISI tried to install a government under Hekmatyar with Jalalabad as their provisional capital, but failed.Kaplan, p.178 The Afghan Interim Government, which they wanted to install, had Hekmatyar as Prime Minister and Abdul Rasul Sayyaf as Foreign Minister. The central organizer of the offensive on the Pakistan side was Lieutenant-General Hamid Gul, Director-General of the ISI. The Jalalabad operation was seen as a grave mistake by other mujahideen leaders such as Ahmad Shah Massoud and Abdul Haq.Kaplan, Robert D. (2001); Soldiers of God: With Islamic Warriors in Afghanistan And Pakistan; Vintage Departures; , p.166 Neither Massoud nor Haq had been informed of the offensive beforehand by the ISI, and neither had participated, as both commanders were considered too independent. After operations by the Shura-e Nazar of Ahmad Shah Massoud, the defection of the communist general Abdul Rashid Dostum, and the subsequent fall of the communist Mohammad Najibullah-regime in 1992, the Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement, the Peshawar Accords. The Accords created the Islamic State of Afghanistan and appointed an interim government for a transitional period to be followed by general elections. According to Human Rights Watch: Gulbuddin Hekmatyar received operational, financial and military support from Pakistan. Afghanistan expert Amin Saikal concludes in Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival: By 1994, however, Hekmatyar had proved unable to conquer territory from the Islamic State. Australian National University Professor William Maley writes, \\"in this respect he was a bitter disappointment to his patrons.\\" Present Since the Afghan Presidential Elections in late 2009 Afghan President Hamid Karzai has increasingly become isolated, surrounding himself with members of Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami. The Associated Press reports: \\"Several of Karzai's close friends and advisers now speak of a president whose doors have closed to all but one narrow faction and who refuses to listen to dissenting opinions.\\" Al-Jazeera wrote in early 2012 that Presidential Chief of Staff, Karim Khoram from Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami, besides controlling the Government Media and Information Center, enjoys a \\"tight grip\\" over President Karzai. Former co-workers of Khoram have accused him of acting \\"divisive internally\\" and having isolated Hamid Karzai's \\"non- Pashtun allies\\". Al-Jazeera observes: \\"The damage that Khoram has inflicted on President Karzai's image in one year - his enemies could not have done the same.\\" Senior non-Hezb-e Islami Pashtun officials in the Afghan government have accused Khoram of acting as a spy for Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence. ==Afghan Taliban== Summary Flag used by the Afghan Taliban, widely believed to receive extensive support by Pakistan's military and its Inter-Services Intelligence. The Taliban were largely founded by Pakistan's Interior Ministry under Naseerullah Babar and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in 1994. In 1999, Naseerullah Babar who was the minister of the interior under Bhutto during the Taliban's ascent to power admitted, \\"we created the Taliban\\". William Maley, Professor at the Australian National University and Director of the Asia-Pacific College, writes on the emergence of the Taliban in Afghanistan: The ISI used the Taliban to establish a regime in Afghanistan which would be favorable to Pakistan, as they were trying to gain strategic depth. Since the creation of the Taliban, the ISI and the Pakistani military have given financial, logistical, military including direct combat support. The ISI trained 80,000 fighters against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Peter Tomsen also stated that up until 9/11 Pakistani military and ISI officers along with thousands of regular Pakistani armed forces personnel had been involved in the fighting in Afghanistan. Human Rights Watch wrote in 2000: In 1998, Iran accused Pakistani commandos of \\"war crimes at Bamiyan\\". The same year Russia said, Pakistan was responsible for the \\"military expansion\\" of the Taliban in northern Afghanistan by sending large numbers of Pakistani troops, including ISI personnel, some of whom had subsequently been taken as prisoners by the anti-Taliban United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan (aka Northern Alliance). In 2000, the UN Security Council imposed an arms embargo against military support to the Taliban, with UN officials explicitly singling out Pakistan. The UN secretary- general criticized Pakistan for its military support and the Security Council stated it was \\"deeply distress[ed] over reports of involvement in the fighting, on the Taliban side, of thousands of non-Afghan nationals.\\" In July 2001, several countries including the United States, accused Pakistan of being \\"in violation of U.N. sanctions because of its military aid to the Taliban.\\" The Taliban also obtained financial resources from Pakistan. In 1997 alone, after the capture of Kabul by the Taliban, Pakistan gave $30 million in aid and a further $10 million for government wages. Development of the Taliban insurgency up until 2006 infiltrating from Pakistan into Afghanistan's Pashtun areas. After the 9/11 attacks, Pakistan claimed to have ended its support to the Taliban. But with the fall of Kabul to anti-Taliban forces in November 2001, ISI forces worked with and helped Taliban militias who were in full retreat. In November 2001, Taliban and Al-Qaeda combatants as well as Pakistani ISI and other military operatives were safely evacuated from the Afghan city of Kunduz on Pakistan Army cargo aircraft to Pakistan Air Force bases in Chitral and Gilgit in Pakistan's Northern Areas in what has been dubbed the \\"Airlift of Evil\\". A range of officials inside and outside Pakistan have stepped up suggestions of links between the ISI and terrorist groups in recent years. In fall 2006, a leaked report by a British Defense Ministry think tank charged, \\"Indirectly Pakistan (through the ISI) has been supporting terrorism and extremism--whether in London on 7/7 [the July 2005 attacks on London's transit system], or in Afghanistan, or Iraq.\\" In June 2008, Afghan officials accused Pakistan's intelligence service of plotting a failed assassination attempt on President Hamid Karzai; shortly thereafter, they implied the ISI's involvement in a July 2008 Taliban attack on the Indian embassy. Indian officials also blamed the ISI for the bombing of the Indian embassy. Numerous U.S. officials have also accused the ISI of supporting terrorist groups including the Afghan Taliban. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said \\"to a certain extent, they play both sides.\\" Gates and others suggest the ISI maintains links with groups like the Afghan Taliban as a \\"strategic hedge\\" to help Islamabad gain influence in Kabul once U.S. troops exit the region. U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen in 2011 called the Haqqani network (the Afghan Taliban's most destructive element) a \\"veritable arm of Pakistan's ISI\\". He further stated, \\"Extremist organizations serving as proxies of the government of Pakistan are attacking Afghan troops and civilians as well as US soldiers.\\" From 2010, a report by a leading British institution also claimed that Pakistan's intelligence service still today has a strong link with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Published by the London School of Economics, the report said that Pakistan's ISI has an \\"official policy\\" of support for the Taliban. It said the ISI provides funding and training for the Taliban, and that the agency has representatives on the so-called Quetta Shura, the Taliban's leadership council. The report, based on interviews with Taliban commanders in Afghanistan, was written by Matt Waldman, a fellow at Harvard University. \\"Pakistan appears to be playing a double-game of astonishing magnitude,\\" the report said. The report also linked high-level members of the Pakistani government with the Taliban. It said Asif Ali Zardari, the Pakistani president, met with senior Taliban prisoners in 2010 and promised to release them. Zardari reportedly told the detainees they were only arrested because of American pressure. \\"The Pakistan government's apparent duplicity ‚Äì and awareness of it among the American public and political establishment ‚Äì could have enormous geopolitical implications,\\" Waldman said. \\"Without a change in Pakistani behaviour it will be difficult if not impossible for international forces and the Afghan government to make progress against the insurgency.\\" Amrullah Saleh, director of Afghanistan's intelligence service until June 2010, told Reuters in 2010 that the ISI was \\"part of a landscape of destruction in this country\\". In March 2012, the Commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, General John Allen, told the United States Senate that as of 2012 there was still no change in Pakistan's policy of support for the Afghan Taliban and its Haqqani network. When asked by U.S. Senator John McCain whether the ISI had severed its links with the Afghan Taliban, General Allen testified: \\"No.\\" Recruitment The Pakistani army through ISI have been accused of recruiting fighters and suicide bombers for the Afghan Taliban among the 1.7 million registered and 1-2 million unregistered Pashtun Afghan refugees living in refugee camps and settlements along the Afghan-Pakistan border in Pakistan many of whom have lived there since the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. Abdel Qadir, an Afghan refugee who returned to Afghanistan, says Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence had asked him to either receive training to join the Afghan Taliban or for him and his family to leave the country. He explains: \\"It is a step by step process. First they come, they talk to you. They ask you for the information. ... Then gradually they ask you for people they can train and send [to Afghanistan]. ... They say, 'Either you do what we say, or you leave the country.'\\" Janat Gul, another former refugee who returned to Afghanistan, told the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, that Afghan refugees which had been successfully recruited by the ISI were taken to Pakistani training camps which had previously been used during the times of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. According to an investigative report among Afghan refugees inside Pakistan by The New York Times, people testified that \\"dozens of families had lost sons in Afghanistan as suicide bombers and fighters\\" and \\"families whose sons had died as suicide bombers in Afghanistan said they were afraid to talk about the deaths because of pressure from Pakistani intelligence agents, the ISI.\\" Pakistani and Afghan tribal elders also testified that the ISI was arresting or even killing Taliban members which wanted to quit fighting and refused to re-enlist to fight in Afghanistan or to die as suicide bombers. One former Taliban commander told The New York Times that such arrests were then sold to the Westerners and others as part of a supposed Pakistani collaboration effort in the War against Terror. Provision of safe haven Gen. James L. Jones, then NATO's supreme commander, in September 2007 testified in front of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the Afghan Taliban movement uses the Pakistani city of Quetta as their main headquarters. Pakistan's Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Tariq Azim Khan, mocked the statement by saying, if there were any Taliban in Quetta, \\"you can count them on your fingers.\\" Training From 2002 until 2004, without major Taliban activities, Afghanistan witnessed relative calm with Afghan civilians and foreigners being able to freely and peacefully walk the streets of major cities and reconstruction being initiated. The 2010 testimonies of former Taliban commanders show that Pakistan through its Inter-Services Intelligence was however \\"actively encouraging a Taliban revival\\" from 2004‚Äì2006. The effort to reintroduce the Afghan Taliban militarily in Afghanistan was preceded by a two-year, large-scale training campaign of Taliban fighters and leaders conducted by the ISI in several training camps in Quetta and other places in Pakistan. From 2004‚Äì2006 the Afghan Taliban consequently started a deadly insurgency campaign in Afghanistan killing thousands of civilians and combatants and thereby renewing and escalating the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent). One Taliban commander involved in the Taliban resurgence said that 80 percent of his fighters had been trained in an ISI camp. ==Haqqani network== The ISI have close links to the Haqqani network and contribute heavily to their funding. U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen in 2011 called the Haqqani network (the Afghan Taliban's most destructive element) a \\"veritable arm of Pakistan's ISI\\". He further stated: Mullen said, the U.S. had evidence that the ISI directly planned and spar- headed the Haqqani 2011 assault on the U.S. embassy, the June 28 Haqqani attack against the Inter-Continental Hotel in Kabul and other operations. It is widely believed the suicide attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul was also planned with the help of the ISI A report in 2008 from the Director of National Intelligence stated that the ISI provides intelligence and funding to help with attacks against the International Security Assistance Force, the Afghan government and Indian targets. ==Al Qaeda== Besides supporting the Hezb-e Islami of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the ISI in conjunction with Saudi Arabia strongly supported the faction of Jalaluddin Haqqani (Haqqani network) and allied Arab groups such as the one surrounding financier Bin Laden, nowadays known as Al-Qaeda, during the war against the Soviets and the Afghan communist government in Afghanistan in the 1980s. In 2000, British Intelligence reported that the ISI was taking an active role in several Al Qaeda training camps from the 1990s onwards. The ISI helped with the construction of training camps for both the Taliban and Al Qaeda. From 1996 to 2001 the Al Qaeda of Osama Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri became a state within the Pakistan-supported Taliban state. Bin Laden sent Arab and Central Asian Al-Qaeda militants to join the Taliban's and Pakistan's fight against the United Front (Northern Alliance) among them his Brigade 055. It is believed that there is still contact between Al-Qaeda and the ISI today. The former Afghan intelligence chief Amrullah Saleh has repeatedly stated that Afghan intelligence believed and had shared information about Osama Bin Laden hiding in an area close to Abbottabad, Pakistan, four years before he (Bin Laden) was killed there. Saleh had shared the information with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf who had angrily brushed off the claim taking no action. In 2007, the Afghans specifically identified two Al-Qaeda safe houses in Manshera, a town just miles from Abbottabad, leading them to believe that Bin Laden was possibly hiding there. But Amrullah Saleh says that Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf angrily smashed his fist on a table when Saleh presented the information to him during a meeting in which Afghan President Hamid Karzai also took part. According to Saleh, \\"He said, 'Am I the president of the Republic of Banana?' Then he turned to President Karzai and said, 'Why have you brought this Panjshiri guy to teach me intelligence?'\\" A December 2011 analysis report by the Jamestown Foundation comes to the conclusion that \\"in spite of denials by the Pakistani military, evidence is emerging that elements within the Pakistani military harbored Osama bin Laden with the knowledge of former army chief General Pervez Musharraf and possibly current Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani. Former Pakistani Army Chief General Ziauddin Butt (a.k.a. General Ziauddin Khawaja) revealed at a conference on Pakistani‚ÄìU.S. relations in October 2011 that according to his knowledge the then former Director-General of Intelligence Bureau of Pakistan (2004‚Äì2008), Brigadier Ijaz Shah (retd.), had kept Osama bin Laden in an Intelligence Bureau safe house in Abbottabad.\\" Pakistani General Ziauddin Butt said Bin Laden had been hidden in Abbottabad \\"with the full knowledge\\" of Pervez Musharraf. But later Butt denied making any such statement. ==Assassination of pivotal Afghan leaders== The ISI has been involved in the assassination of major Afghan leaders which have been described as pivotal for the future of Afghanistan. Among those leaders are the main anti-Taliban resistance leader and National Hero of Afghanistan Ahmad Shah Massoud and the prominent Pashtun anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban resistance leader Abdul Haq. The ISI has also been accused of having been involved in the murder of former Afghan president and chief of the Karzai's administration High Peace Council Burhanuddin Rabbani and several other anti-Taliban leaders. Massoud was killed by two Arab suicide bombers two days before the September 11, 2011 (9/11) attacks in the United States. The assassins - supposed journalists - were granted multiple entry visas valid for a year in early 2001 by Pakistan's embassy in London. As author and Afghanistan expert Sandy Gall writes such multiple visas for a year are \\"unheard of for journalists normally\\". The ISI subsequently facilitated the two men's passage through Pakistan over the Afghan border into Taliban territory. Afghan journalist Fahim Dashty says, \\"Al-Qaida, the Taliban, other terrorists, the Pakistan security services -- they were all working together ... to kill him.\\" Abdul Haq, who was killed by the Taliban on October 26, 2001, enjoying strong popular support among Afghanistan's Pashtuns, wanted to create and support a popular uprising against the Taliban - also dominantly Pashtuns - among the Pashtuns. Observers believe that the Taliban were only able to capture him with the collaboration of the ISI. Ahmad Shah Massoud had been the only resistance leader able to defend vast parts of his territory against the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and the Pakistani military and was sheltering hundreds of thousands of refugees which had fled the Taliban on the territory under his control. He had been seen as the leader most likely to lead post- Taliban Afghanistan. After his assassination, Abdul Haq was seen as one of the main contenders for that position. He had private American backers which had facilitated his re-entry into Afghanistan after 9/11. But journalists reported about tensions between the CIA and Haq.Slavin, Barbara and Weisman, Jonathan. \\"Taliban foe's death sparks criticism of U.S. goals\\", USA Today, October 31, 2001. Retrieved September 23, 2006. Former CIA director George Tenet reports that, at the recommendation of one of Haq's private American lobbyists Bud McFarlane, CIA officials met with Abdul Haq in Pakistan but after assessing him urged him not to enter Afghanistan.George Tenet, At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA, p. 218 (HarperCollins 2007). Both leaders, Massoud and Haq, were recognized for being fiercely independent from foreign, especially Pakistani, influence. Both, two of the most successful anti-Soviet resistance leaders, were rejecting the Pakistani claim of hegemony over the Afghan mujahideen. Abdul Haq was quoted as saying during the anti-Soviet period: \\"How is that we Afghans, who never lost a war, must take military instructions from the Pakistanis, who never won one?\\" Massoud during the Soviet period said to the Pakistani Foreign Minister who had asked him to send a message to the Russians through the Pakistanis who were conducting talks \\"on behalf of our Afghan brethren\\": \\"Why should I send a message? Why are you talking on our behalf? Don't we have leaders here to talk on our behalf?\\" Khan replied \\"This is how it has been and how it will be. Do you have a message?\\" Massoud told the foreign minister that \\"nobody who talks on our behalf will have any kind of result.\\" Consequently, neither Massoud nor Abdul Haq were consulted before and neither participated in the Battle of Jalalabad (1989) in which the ISI tried but failed to install Gulbuddin Hekmatyar as the post- communist leader of Afghanistan. ==See also== * Inter-Services Intelligence activities in India * Operation Cyclone ==References== Afghanistan Category:Afghanistan‚ÄìPakistan relations Category:Intelligence operations ","title":"Inter-Services Intelligence activities in Afghanistan"},{"id":"35247080","text":"Lily Ho is a Hong Kong actress and former Miss Hong Kong contestant.

He worked closely alongside his brother Otto Timm in the early days of aviation and was a pioneer in Hollywood films. ==Aviation career== Timm started in aviation as early as 1910.Skyways for Business (National Business Aircraft Association, American Aviation Publications), Volumes 15‚Äì16, 1956. Along with his brothers, Otto and Reuben, he first moved to San Diego, California before relocating in Venice, California. Timm began to work as a mechanic, servicing aircraft for Al Wilson, an exhibition pilot, in exchange for flying lessons.Wynne 1987, p. 16. He briefly became a wing-walker, but mainly flew when Wilson performed as a wing-walker.Wynne 1987, pp. 17, 23. In 1920, Timm's piloting skills were noted for flying an outdated biplane with a Curtiss OX-5 engine from Los Angeles to Bishop California over the mountains and desert.Aerial Age, August 29, 1921, p. 586. Trying his hand at air racing, Timm entered the Winter Air Tournament held in December 1920 at Daugherty Municipal Field in Long Beach. The events included a 100-mile free-for-all and a 60-mile handicap race in which Timm took third place in a 1916 biplane built by Eddie Barnhart.Parks, Dennis. \\"The OX-5 Racers.\\" General Aviation News, September 18, 2011.

One of Timm's early movie stunts involved launching a tethered Curtiss JN-4 from the Los Angeles Railway building for the movie Stranger than Fiction (1921). Timm was only the aircraft assembler and rope cutter on the unauthorized launch.Kelly 2008, p. 37.

The yellow building in the lower right is a mole hole, also known as a readiness crew building. Minot AFB, ND, in 1973 with its \\"Christmas Tree\\" at capacity A \\"Christmas tree\\" was a type of alert area constructed by the United States Air Force for the Strategic Air Command (SAC) during the Cold War. Oftentimes, bombers or tanker aircraft were stationed next to a readiness crew building (RCB), also known as \\"mole hole\\" facilities. The alert apron, also known as an alert ramp, received the name \\"Christmas tree\\", because in planform it resembled a tree of the same name. ==History== Before the development of the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, aircraft such as the Convair B-36 Peacemaker, Boeing B-50 Superfortress and Boeing B-47 Stratojet were parked on alert aprons at right angles. Due to the size of the aircraft, this created a problem in launching aircraft efficiently in the event of an emergency scramble, requiring a different solution to be devised. To fix this, aircraft were repositioned on specifically designed alert aprons arranged in herringbone configurations, which then allowed the planes to pull out onto the runway as quickly as possible. This meant that the aircraft would be positioned at 45 degrees in relation to an alert apron center-line leading to a short taxiway and then onto the nearest runway(s). Two aircraft would be positioned on either side of the center-line, typically four deep on either side, with one additional aircraft being positioned directly aligned on the center-line farthest back. The success of this formation also led to the adoption of the setup for the Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter and KB-50 Superfortress aerial refueling aircraft. As newer bomber and aircraft eventually entered the SAC inventory, the \\"Christmas tree\\" aprons would be used by the B-47 Stratojet, B-52 Stratofortress, Convair B-58 Hustler, General Dynamics FB-111, Rockwell B-1 Lancer, Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker and McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender aircraft. During an alert, flight crews and ground crews would run out of the alert facility, i.e., the \\"mole hole,\\" either to their awaiting planes or to alert vehicles that they would drive to said aircraft. This latter option was particularly critical for crews of the last three aircraft on the ramp that were located several hundred yards from the alert facility. During an alert sortie, there was no specific departure order; the first plane ready to taxi was the first to leave. At this point, the aircraft would perform an \\"elephant walk\\" to the duty runway, which was typically located close to the Christmas tree, due to the need to launch the aircraft as quickly as possible in response to a probable inbound enemy attack. If the aircraft were to be launched as quickly as possible, then a Minimum Interval Takeoff (MITO) would be performed, in order to lessen the chance that the aircraft would be caught on the ground in the event of a nuclear strike. Although it is unknown how much each \\"Christmas tree\\" cost to construct and maintain, the Christmas tree at the former Loring Air Force Base, Maine is estimated to have cost $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) when it was constructed between 1959 and 1960. Department of the Air Force site master plan for Wurtsmith Air Force Base from October 1957, you can see both the Christmas Tree at the top center for bombers on ready alert, as well as the stubbed apron where aerial refueling tankers were kept. Although Strategic Air Command was disestablished in 1992, \\"Christmas tree\\" aprons and their associated \\"mole holes\\" continue to exist on numerous Air Force Global Strike Command, Air Combat Command, Air Mobility Command, Air Education and Training Command, Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard bases, as well as two active Army Air Fields and several civilian and joint civil- military airports that were previously SAC installations for all or part of the 1950s through the 1990s. ==References *Strategic Air Command facilities Category:United States Air Force ","title":"Christmas tree (aviation)"},{"id":"35247451","text":"Kolbila is an Adamawa language of Cameroon and Nigeria. ==Distribution== Kolbila is closely related to Samba Leko.

The pilot introduces viewers to a varied group of personalities working on a fictional late-night American sports show called Sports Night, on the CSC network. The episode centres on the team's attempts to broadcast a feature about an African athlete who is due to take part in his first race following recovery from a potentially career-ending injury. One of the two lead anchors on the show, Casey, is called up for having an unprofessional attitude on and off screen in the light of his recent divorce from his wife, and is even thinking of leaving the show. Producer Natalie is stuck in a dilemma when she becomes attracted to her colleague Jeremy, who is the new sports statistician at the network. Six characters receive top billing in the episode: Casey McCall (Peter Krause), Dan Rydell (Josh Charles), Dana Whitaker (Felicity Huffman), Isaac Jaffe (Robert Guillaume), Natalie Hurley (Sabrina Lloyd) and Jeremy Goodwin (Joshua Malina). Several recurring characters also appear in the first episode, including Kim (Kayla Blake), Elliot (Greg Baker), Chris (Timothy Davis-Reed) and Will (Ron Ostrow). Robert Mailhouse guest-stars as J.J., while Bernard Hocke and Nina Jane Barry appear as Dave and Claire respectively. The episode received largely positive reviews. The episode has received multiple nominations and has won Outstanding Directorial Achievement for a Comedy Series at the 52nd Directors Guild of America Awards and also a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series. ==Plot== The pilot episode introduces the six main characters of the series, as well as the cast of supporting characters. Casey McCall, one of the co-anchors of Sports Night, a sports television roundup show running at 11pm on CSC, the \\"number 3 sports network\\" ‚Äì a channel modeled on ESPN and similar ‚Äì is displaying a negative attitude, both on and off screen, as a result of his recent divorce. Dan Rydell, his co-anchor, tries to get back his positive attitude, while J.J. and the network executives begin to get vocal about his need to improve or leave the company. Dana Whitaker, his producer, vociferously defends him to the executive producer, Isaac Jaffe, even while she tries to get him to shape up before they override her shielding of him. At the same time, Casey himself is thinking about quitting sports broadcasting, citing the moral decay he's seen on the job, in spite of Dan's observation that he'd only be doing it for the wrong reasons. Dana also hires a new associate producer, the highly strung but brilliant Jeremy Goodwin, who co-producer Natalie Hurley takes a liking to. At the end of the episode, a unique sporting event involving the return of a 41-year-old injured athlete to the running track makes Casey change his mind. ==Production== Conception Sorkin gathered inspiration for the show from a number of places. According to the Huffington Post, \\"Sorkin got the idea [for the show] from watching TV...while writing The American President. He was watching ESPN, and found the humor and banter from the anchors (Dan Patrick and...either Keith Olbermann or Craig Kilborn) intoxicating, and decided to create a comedy set in that world\\". The show utilises a laugh track, which the Post-Gazette described as following \\"an unwritten primetime rule: all half- hour shows, except animated comedies...must have a laugh track\\" and Hollywood.com's Peter Hall calls a \\"goof\\" that \\"crippled\\" the first few episodes\\" of the show. It is used sparingly in the pilot as \\"Sports Night has so many dramatic moments\\". The show was pitched as not being aimed exclusively at sports fans, with the tagline \\"It's about sports. The same way Charlie's Angels was about law enforcement.\\" Based on the pre-air pilot, ABC ordered Sports Night for the fall 1998 television season. Casting The pilot episode, as with the rest of the series, uses an ensemble cast, with six of the cast members identified as main characters. Peter Krause and Josh Charles played the two lead anchors on the CSC network, Casey McCall and Dan Rydell respectively. Felicity Huffman played Sports Night producer Dana Whitaker, while Robert Guillaume appeared as her boss, Isaac Jaffe, the executive producer. The main cast is rounded off by Sabrina Lloyd, who plays co-producer Natalie Hurley, and Joshua Malina, who plays Jeremy Goodwin, a new addition to the crew in the pilot. Other characters given billing include Kayla Blake as Kim, Greg Baker as Elliot, Timothy Davis-Reed as Chris and Ron Ostrow as Will. ==Reception== Ratings It was announced on May 18, 1998 that the show would debut on Tuesdays at 9:30 as part of ABC's comedy block, following Home Improvement, The Hughleys and Spin City. The series debuted on ABC in the opening week of the 1998‚Äì99 television season, on September 22, 1998. ABC finished behind CBS in viewing figures for the opening week of programming, while ratings across the networks fell by 4 million compared to the previous year. Critical reception Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker was positive, despite his initial skepticism. He worried that Aaron Sorkin would not be able to translate big-screen success on films such as A Few Good Men and The American President to television, and believed before watching the show that it was \\"a golden opportunity to stink up prime time with the sort of smug, smirky, life-drainingly ironic talking heads who've outlasted their naughty-boy novelty status on ESPN\\". However, after watching the show, he wrote \\"But against all odds, Sports Night is a home run, a hole in one, a touchdown ‚Äî at once the most consistently funny, intelligent, and emotional of any new-season series.\\" The Huffington Post's Bob Sassone, while reviewing the show retrospectively in 2006, praised the \\"intelligent writing, fast-paced dialogue, and a strong ensemble cast of smart, moral characters all working toward a common goal.\\" He also pointed out links betweenSports Night and Aaron Sorkin's next production, the critically acclaimed The West Wing. The Washington Post called Sports Night \\"the best new ABC sitcom of the season\\" and also commented \\"Aaron Sorkin...[has] certainly got a knack for snappy, and occasionally moving, dialogue.\\" They were among a number of publications to point out how the show would appeal to sports fans and non-sports enthusiasts alike. The Associated Press marked Sports Night out as one of the few potential successes amongst the freshman shows for the 1998‚Äì99 season. Entertainment Weekly believed that the season as a whole deserved to be nominated for best comedy at the Emmys. Awards and nominations The episode received multiple award nominations. The episode's director Thomas Schlamme won Directors Guild of America award for Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing ‚Äì Comedy Series in 1999. The episode also won for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series at the Emmy Awards in 1999. Bonnie Zane and Paula Rosenberg were nominated for an Artios Award for Best Casting for TV, Comedy Pilot from the Casting Society of America. ==ReferencesSports Night Category:1998 American television episodes Category:Emmy Award-winning episodes ","title":"Pilot (Sports Night)"},{"id":"35247615","text":"The Sri Lanka Railways M4 is a class of diesel-electric locomotive manufactured in Canada by Montreal Locomotive Works.

Officially the Prince Yi of Yan (ÁáïÊáøÁéã), he was the second son of Emperor Taizu and the crown prince since his elder brother died young. However, he did not succeed the throne after his father, as his uncle Emperor Taizong assumed power. ==Death== In 979, 3 years after his father's death, Zhao Dezhao was leading an army in Emperor Taizong's first campaign against the Khitans, when rumors spread in the army that Emperor Taizong had disappeared, and that Zhao Dezhao should be the new emperor. The rumors died when Emperor Taizong was found, however, and Emperor Taizong was very unhappy about the results of his campaign and refused to award the troops sparking complaints from them. On August 26, Zhao Dezhao went to inquire the emperor, who either barked \\"You do that when you become the new emperor!\\" or \\"You may do it yourself after you have ascended the throne! There's still time for that!\\" Zhao Dezhao immediately went to his palace and asked his guards for a sabre. The guards told him that blades were not allowed in the palace, so Zhao Dezhao fetched a knife for cutting fruits, went to his room and then proceeded to slice his throat killing him. Upon hearing about the suicide, Emperor Taizong was very saddened and hugged the corpse crying while saying \\"Silly boy, how did you come to this depravity?‚Äù However, as official history may not be trusted in events like this, some historians suspect that Zhao Dezhao was either murdered or forced to commit suicide by his uncle, who possibly was also involved in the deaths of Zhao Dezhao's father and younger brother. Zhao Defang, the last surviving son of Emperor Taizu, died 2 years after Zhao Dezhao. He was also in his 20s. He was the ancestor of Zhao Yun and Zhao Qi who later became emperors. They were posthumously known as Emperor Lizong and Emperor Duzong respectively. ==Family== * Parents: ** Zhao Kuangyin, Taizu (; 21 March 927 ‚Äì 14 November 976) ** Empress Xiaohui, of the He clan (; 929 ‚Äì 958) * Consorts and Issue: **Lady Wang (ÁéãÊ∞è) **Lady He (Ë≥ÄÊ∞è) **Lady Chen (Èô≥Ê∞è) **Lady Zhu (Êú±Ê∞è) **Unknown ***Zhao Weizheng, Prince Jing (; d. 1032) ***Zhao Weiji, Prince Ji () ***Zhao Weigu, Prince Wei () ***Zhao Weizhong, Duke Shu () ***Zhao Weihe () == References == * Toqto'a et al., History of Song, vol. 244. * Sima Guang, Sushui Jiwen, vol. 2.

The films describe how a group of Indonesian army cadets fights for freedom from Dutch colonialism. This film is an adaptation of Japanese propaganda film Hati Merdeka by Andreas Liong and Ignatius Matulessy in 1944. ==Context== Set during the revolution's darkest hour in early 1948, HEARTS OF FREEDOM follows a heroic band of cadets who become elite guerrilla soldiers following a 1947 massacre of their cadet classmates (a story based on the real-life battle that killed both of Hashim's uncles in Lengkong in 1946). Portrayed brilliantly by an all-star cast of Indonesia's most talented young actors: Donny Alamsyah, nominated for Best Actor for RED AND WHITE at the 2010 Bandung Film Festival; T. Rifnu Wikana and Lukman Sardi, nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor for BLOOD OF EAGLES in the recent Indonesia Movie Awards; Aldy Zulfikar for Best Newcomer as the child soldier Budi; Rahayu Saraswati, winner of Best Actress at the 2009 Bali International Film Festival for RED AND WHITE; and Darius Sinathrya, who has his biggest role to date in this film. ==Plot== After completing a tragic mission in which one of the band's most beloved members is killed, the band's loyalty to the cause is put to the ultimate test when their leader, Amir (Lukman Sardi) resigns from the Army in disgust. Leaderless and heartsick over their losses, the cadets carry their vendetta for revenge against the Dutch to the high seas in a dangerous mission to Bali, home island of the maimed mute Dayan (T. Rifnu Wikana), where they are sent to kill the Dutch militia Colonel Raymer (Michael Bell), who murdered the family of the band's new leader Tomas (Donny Alamsyah) in the opening of RED AND WHITE. Facing the cannons of a Dutch PT boat, the hard-drinking playboy Marius (Darius Sinathrya) must overcome his fears as he rivals Tomas for the affections of the starchy aristocrat's daughter Senja (Rahayu Saraswati). Arriving in Bali, the band saves the woman Dayu (new cast member Ranggani Puspandya) from the ravages of Colonel Raymer's KNIL militia, but one of the heroes is nearly killed. As their friend hovers between life and death, the band finds the caves of rebel leader Wayan Suta (played by the singer Nugie). Tomas clashes with their former commander, Amir (Lukman Sardi) as they plan a final assault against Raymer's militia, raising the question: how far can the revolution go to defeat evil, and still retain its ideals? ==Cast== * Lukman Sardi as Amir * Darius Sinathrya as Marius * Donny Alamsyah as Thomas * Teuku Rifnu Wikana as Dayan * Rahayu Saraswati as Senja * Astri Nurdin as Melati * Ranggani Puspandya as Dayu * Nugie as Wayan Suta * Agung Udijana as Sumarjo ==External links== * *https://web.archive.org/web/20120103133442/http://www.hatimerdeka.com/ Category:Indonesian films Category:Indonesian-language films ","title":"Hearts of Freedom"},{"id":"35247662","text":"Rudbar-e Shahrestan () may refer to: *Rudbar-e Shahrestan District *Rudbar-e Shahrestan Rural District ","title":"Rudbar-e Shahrestan"},{"id":"35247671","text":"Yongbei Zhuang is a Zhuang variety including the dialects of Yongning North, Binyang, Hengxian, and Pingguo dialects.

RatPac-Dune Entertainment, LLC was formed in September 2013 by RatPac and Dune with a multi-year 75-picture co-financing arrangement with Warner Bros.. On November 26, 2013, RatPac-Dune finalized a $300 million credit facility with a group of banks, led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, that has an option to be extended to $400 million. In April 2018, Warner Bros. announced that they will not renew its contract with RatPac-Dune Entertainment after Brett Ratner's sexual harassment allegations. In November 2018, RatPac-Dune's minority ownership stake in a library of 76 Warner Bros. films was put for sale, with investors in the fund backing the library to cash out. Vine Alternative Investments made a high bid for the library, but in January 2019, Warner Bros. exercised its rights to match the bid for the library, and essentially acquired RatPac-Dune's stakes. The cost was estimated at nearly $300 million. RatPac-Dune films The 75-picture deal passively covered all movies outside of other production financing deals including those with Village Roadshow Pictures, Gulfstream and Alcon Entertainment and all Harry Potter films. The deal was passive both financially and creatively as RatPac-Dune did not select which films to finance nor had any creative say over the films. ;Financed with Warner Bros. * Gravity (2013) (co-production with Heyday Films) (uncredited) * Grudge Match (2013) (co-production with Gerber Pictures) * The Lego Movie (2014) (co- production with Warner Animation Group and Village Roadshow Pictures) * Winter's Tale (2014) (co-production with Village Roadshow Pictures and Weed Road Pictures) * 300: Rise of an Empire (2014) (co-production with Legendary Pictures and Cruel and Unusual Films) * Godzilla (2014) (co-production with Legendary Pictures) * Blended (2014) (co-production with Happy Madison Productions and Flower Films) * Edge of Tomorrow (2014) (co-production with Village Roadshow Pictures) * Jersey Boys (2014) (co-production with GK Films) * Tammy (2014) (with New Line Cinema) (co-production with Gary Sanchez Productions) * Into the Storm (2014) (with New Line Cinema) (co-production with Village Roadshow Pictures) * If I Stay (2014) (with New Line Cinema and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) * This Is Where I Leave You (2014) * Annabelle (2014) (with New Line Cinema) * The Judge (2014) (co-production with Village Roadshow Pictures) * Inherent Vice (2014) * Horrible Bosses 2 (2014) (with New Line Cinema) * American Sniper (2014) (co-production with Village Roadshow Pictures) * Jupiter Ascending (2015) (co-production with Village Roadshow Pictures) * Focus (2015) (co-production with Overbrook Entertainment and Di Novi Pictures) * Run All Night (2015) * Get Hard (2015) (co-production with Gary Sanchez Productions) * The Water Diviner (2015) * Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) (co-production with Village Roadshow Pictures and Kennedy Miller Mitchell) * San Andreas (2015) (with New Line Cinema) (co-production with Village Roadshow Pictures) * Entourage (2015) (co-production with HBO) * Magic Mike XXL (2015) * The Gallows (2015) (with New Line Cinema) (co-production with Blumhouse Productions) * Vacation (2015) (with New Line Cinema) * The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

With the adoption of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1946 and via its replacement by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, these countries developed a comprehensive legal framework, that reflected their common legal traditions, to facilitate these relationships, including a system to settle disputes that favored litigation. Somewhat under GATT in the 1950s but specifically with the adoption of the WTO, these countries engaged increased trade with Asian countries, as they became signatories. Initially, while the U.S. and the Allied Powers leveraged the agreement's respective legal frameworks and dispute-mechanisms including litigation to deal with disputes with their trading partners, many Asian countries choose not to. Instead, they avoided legal confrontation, in favor of bilateral negotiations to arrive at a settlement. Social-cultural disparities between each, concerning an inclination to litigate, are likely indicative of why. However, in the 1980s and 1990s, under both GATT and WTO, many Asian countries began to utilize their legal frameworks to settle disputes. In 2001, in Aggressive Legalism: The Rules of the WTO and Japan‚Äôs Emerging Trade Strategy, Saadia M. Pekkanen described the increasing tendency of the Japanese government‚Äôs use of the World Trade Organization's (WTO) dispute settlement protocols to counter adverse acts by its trading partners as aggressive legalism. Aggressive legalism, she argued is ‚Äúa conscious strategy where a substantive set of international legal rules can be made to serve as both ‚Äòshield‚Äô and ‚Äòsword‚Äô in trade disputes among sovereign states.‚Äù == Modern aggressive legalism == In a policy primer for the United States Government, The Policymaker's Library wrote that the United States' influence with its Asian trading partners has waned and that an \\"emphasis on aggressive legalism\\" affords opportunities to reshape economic relationships going forward. United States The Korea‚ÄìUS Free Trade Agreement (KORUS), reflects a political strategy by both the United States and South Korea of aggressive legalism. That is, both countries agreed to envelope in the agreement binding legal rules to deal with lingering bilateral trade disputes.  Asia  Following the succession of GATT with the WTO in the 1980s and 1990s, many Asian countries, including China, Japan, and South Korea, shifted to a policy of aggressive legalism, evidenced by each's willingness to use the legal frameworks provided under both to directly engage bilateral trading disputes with their partners. ==References== Category:Theories of law Category:Sociology of law Category:Philosophy of law Category:Trade blocs Category:Political philosophy ","title":"Aggressive legalism"},{"id":"35247771","text":"Ak (, also Romanized as Ark and ƒÄch) is a village in Eqbal-e Gharbi Rural District, in the Central District of Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

At the same event the following year, Canter was once again a singles quarterfinalist.ITF Junior Profile ==Professional career== Canter never made the third round of the singles draw at a Grand Slam.ATP World Tour Profile He twice came close, the first time at the 1986 French Open when he squandered a two set lead over Jean-Philippe Fleurian in their second-round encounter. In the US Open that year, after coming from two sets down to defeat Tim Mayotte in his opening match, Canter was again at the wrong end of a second-round match decided in five sets, losing to Dan Goldie. He did, however, reach the third round on four occasions in the doubles. His biggest win came during the 1990 Wimbledon Championships, where he and partner Bruce Derlin upset reigning champions John Fitzgerald and Anders J√§rryd. In 1985, Canter won his only Grand Prix/ATP title, at the Melbourne Outdoor tournament. The following year, he would make it to No. 36 in the world. His best results that season were semifinal appearances at Montreal and Toronto. In Montreal, he had a win over world No. 4, Yannick Noah. ==Grand Prix career finals== Singles: 1 (1‚Äì0) {class=\\"sortable \\" style=font- size:97% !width=65Result !width=50Year !width=180Tournament !width=50Surface !width=170Opponent !width=120Score - bgcolor=98FB98Win 1985 Melbourne, Australia Grass  Peter Doohan 5‚Äì7, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì4 } ==Challenger titles== Singles (1) {class=\\"sortable \\" style=font-size:97% !width=20No. !width=50Year !width=160Tournament !width=50Surface !width=170Opponent !width=100Score - 1. 1987 Guadeloupe Hard  Larry Stefanki 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì4 } Doubles (3) {class=\\"sortable \\" style=font-size:97% !width=30No. !width=50Year !width=160Tournament !width=50Surface !width=160Partner !width=160Opponents !width=120Score - 1. 1990 Bangkok, Thailand Hard  Bruce Derlin  Neil Borwick David Lewis 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì4 - 2. 1991 Guam Hard  Kenny Thorne  David Adams Doug Eisenman 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì2 - 3. 1993 Reunion Island Hard  Jeff Tarango  Lan Bale Mark Kaplan 6‚Äì4, 3‚Äì6, 7‚Äì5 } ==References== Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:American male tennis players Category:Tennis people from California Category:US Open (tennis) junior champions Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in boys' doubles ","title":"Jonathan Canter"},{"id":"35248283","text":"Tukpa, also known as Nesang, is a Tibetic language spoken in the Lahaul and Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh, India.

It is, to some extant mutually intelligible with other Sino-Tibetan language like kinnauri. == Sociolinguistic situation == Currently there are roughly 1700 active speakers of Kanashi in the Malana Nala which is up from the previous estimate of 1400 in the early 2000s. Its current status to date is threatened.Chauhan, , Endangered Languages, 2002 The village that uses this language is located roughly 10,000 feet above sea level isolated from civilization. == Simple sentences == It seems apparent that speakers of Kanashi favor simple sentences over complex and compound sentences due to the sporadic usage of the later two. Kanashi speakers use both subject‚Äìverb‚Äìobject order and subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb order. The interesting fact about Kanashi is that being a pro normalized language it doesn't require the subject and verb to be mentioned separately, particularity in 1st and 2nd person when these are incorporated in the verb form itself.D. D. Sharma, Tribal Languages of Himachal Pradesh Part-Two, Mittal Publications, 1992 == Gender == In Kanashi there seems to be a lack of grammatical gender. The natural gender that has no bearing on the other constituents within an utterance is distinguished in one of two ways. The first is to use distinct terms for groups of males and females and second is by prefixing terms with the meaning father or mother to the substantive in question. One interesting fact in Kanashi in regards to gender is that gender distinction occurs only among humans, all inanimate and animate objects of lower species tend to be genderless. == Numbers == Kanashi tends to use mostly nouns, pronouns and verbs. Pronominal and nominal stems are inflected for two numbers, viz. singular and plural only. If desired the dual number can be indicated as \\"nis\\" for two as in two men. The absence of a plural marker indicates singularity in Kanashi however, in non formal speech the plural marker is left out too because it is inferred from the context of the sentence. Plural marker suffixes are also left out if numerals other than the numeral for one or by terms such as many, several, all, some, a few, etc. The numeral system also uses a unique form to represent a base ten system. Twenty is stated as twice ten and forty is twice twice ten.T. C.

Following the end of the war, it was stripped of personnel and equipment, but remained on the active roll until 1947. The squadron was reactivated in 1948 and provided weather services from various bases in the midwestern United States until inactivating in 1961 . ==History== World War II The squadron was first organized at Bolling Field, District of Columbia at the end of June 1942. After organizing and training in the United States, it departed for the Mediterranean Theater of Operations in September, arriving in Egypt in November. Squadron headquarters was located on the Horn of Africa, at Gura, Eritrea by December, but relocated to Accra, Gold Coast (now Ghana) by the spring of 1943, and remained there for the rest of the war. The squadron operated through detachments located throughout northern Africa and, after 1943, in Italy. The squadron supported special operations in the Mediterranean. By May 1944, it had seven detachments operating behind German lines in the Balkans, primarily in Albania and Yugoslavia.Warren, p. 18 In March, two squadron weather observers and a radioman had parachuted into Yugoslavia and were embedded with Tito's partisan forces to provide information for Douglas C-47 Skytrains airlifting supplies for the partisans.Markus, et al., p. 10 In the spring of 1946 the squadron left Accra, and in June 1946, moved without personnel to Wiesbaden, Germany. It remained there as a paper unit until inactivating in October 1947. Cold War The squadron was again activated on 1 June 1948 at Smoky Hill Air Force Base, Kansas. It moved twice in the next three years before arriving at Kansas City, Missouri in September 1951, providing regional weather coverage for USAF units. From Kansas City, and later, from Grandview Air Force Base (later Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base, its detachments provided weather services for the bases of Central Air Defense Force (CADF) and the squadron commander acted as the staff weather officer for CADF.

Kelly Douglas and Co. Ltd., [1971] SCR 562 [Highway Properties] is a leading Canadian property law case concerning commercial landlord-tenant relationships decided by the Supreme Court of Canada. The decision imported the contract law concept of repudiation and recovery for prospective damages into property law. This gave landlords the right to sue a tenant for breach of a lease agreement (usually by abandonment) and recover the present value of unpaid future rent as well as losses resulting from lost business due to the tenant's breach of the lease agreement. ==Background== The landlord, Highway Properties Ltd., leased a retail location in its shopping centre to the tenant, Kelly Douglas and Co. Ltd., \\"to be used for grocery store and super market\\". The lease was agreed to on August 19, 1960, and was to take effect for a term of fifteen years from October 1, 1960. The landlord's shopping centre consisted of 11 retail spaces and the supermarket was to be the anchor tenant of the venture. Clause 9 of the lease agreement provided that the tenant carry on \\"its business on the said premises continuously.\\" The premises in question was operated as a grocery store by a subtenant beginning October 20, 1960. However, the shopping centre was not successful and was never fully leased. By March 24, 1962, the subtenant gave notice that it intended to close down its business. It did so and began to remove its goods. On July 16, 1962, the landlord filed suit against the tenant. The tenant continued to pay rent while unsuccessfully searching for another subtenant. By November 22, 1963, the premises had been abandoned, and most of the other tenants in the shopping centre had also moved out. On that date the landlord took possession of the premises and attempted to find a new tenant. At trial the landlord claimed damages suffered for rescission but more importantly, also for prospective loss resulting from the respondent's failure to carry on a supermarket business in the shopping centre for the full term of the lease.Highway Properties at 568. At issue in the Supreme Court was the prospective loss from breach of the lease agreement. ==Opinion of the Court== Laskin J., writing for a unanimous Court, surveyed the existing state of landlord-tenant law, and summarized the three existing mutually exclusive remedies available to landlords for repudiation of a lease. The three traditional remedies under the common law were: # Upon refusal to accept repudiation, the landlord could insist on performance of the lease and sue the tenant for rent owed each time it came due; # Upon acceptance of the repudiation and termination of the lease, the landlord could re-possess the premises and sue the tenant for rent owed or losses resulting from the tenant's breach of covenants to the date of termination; or # Advise the tenant that he proposes to re-let the property on behalf of the tenant and enter possession on that basis (thereby continuing the landlord-tenant relationship), and sue for shortfall in rent where it occurs.Highway Properties at 570. Laskin accepted the landlord's argument for a fourth remedy: > [T]he landlord may elect to terminate the lease but with notice to the > defaulting tenant that damages will be claimed on the footing of a present > recovery of damages for losing the benefit of the lease over its unexpired > term. One element of such damages would be, of course, the present value of > the unpaid future rent for the unexpired period of the lease less the actual > rental value of the premises for that period. Another element would be the > loss, so far as provable, resulting from the repudiation of clause 9. > Highway Properties at 570. In doing so, Laskin noted that the traditional property law remedies did not properly account for the realities of modern commercial tenancies, which were highly contractual in nature: > There are some general considerations that support the view that I would > take. It is no longer sensible to pretend that a commercial lease, such as > the one before this Court, is simply a conveyance and not also a contract. > It is equally untenable to persist in denying resort to the full armoury of > remedies ordinarily available to redress repudiation of covenants, merely > because the covenants may be associated with an estate in land. Finally, > there is merit here as in other situations in avoiding multiplicity of > actions that may otherwise be a concomitant of insistence that a landlord > engage in instalment litigation against a repudiating tenant.Highway > Properties at 576. The appeal was allowed on this fourth basis of damages and the case was remitted to the trial court for an assessment of the amount owed by the tenant. ==Aftermath== The Highway Properties judgment essentially imported the contractual remedy for recovery of future losses as a result of repudiation, but left open the question of whether notice was required (and if so, when it must be given) and whether there is a duty for the landlord to mitigate losses as is the case in contract law.Barbara L Grossman and Y Annie Na, \\"Damages: Highway Properties v. Kelly, Douglas & Co. - Recent Developments\\" in Harvey M. Haber, ed, Shopping Centre Leases, 2nd ed (Aurora: Canada Law Book, 2008) 891 at 894. Notice requirement Subsequent cases have been unclear as to whether reasonable notice prior to repudiation is required in all circumstances to claim recovery of prospective damages. In Veysoglu v O'Keefe and Goudie,Veysoglu v O'Keefe and Goudie (1989), 81 Nfld & PEIR 317 (Nfld SC(TD)) the court held that notice was not necessary because the lease agreement specifically provided that the balance of rent owed for the full term of the lease became due upon repudiation of the lease by the tenant. The court found that the explicit recognition of the right of action negated the need for notice as the tenant was already aware of this possibility when he signed the lease. On the other hand, the court in Langley Crossing Shopping Centre v North-West Produce,Langley Crossing Shopping Centre v North-West Produce (1998), 20 RPR (3d) 112 (BCSC) held that separate notice was still necessary at the time of termination. Another related issue left open was whether notice must be contemporaneous with the termination of the lease. Courts have generally held that the notice be given within a \\"reasonable time\\" but not necessarily simultaneous with termination of the lease. For example, in North Bay T.V. and Audio Ltd. v Nova Electronics Ltd. Et Al.,North Bay T.V. and Audio Ltd. v Nova Electronics Ltd. Et Al. (1983), 4 DLR (4th) 88 (Ont HC) aff'd (1984), 47 OR (2d) 588 (CA) a statement of claim about six weeks after the tenant terminated the lease was held to be within \\"reasonable time\\". Mitigation of losses Prior to the decision in Highway Properties, landlords were not under a duty to mitigate their losses following a tenant's abandonment. Using the three traditional remedies available in leasehold law, they were able to keep the lease alive and hold the tenant responsible for rent in arrears. However, the importation of contractual principles made this less clear. Landlords were still able to sue under the three traditional remedies, but also had access to a fourth for prospective damages. The Supreme Court of Canada has not addressed the issue of mitigation following Highway Properties, and provincial appellate courts have been inconsistent.Jason Brock and Jim Phillips, \\"The Commercial Lease: Property or Contract?\\" (2000) 38 Alta L Rev 989 at para 21 It is clear, however, that where the landlord has in fact mitigated their losses (for example by renting out the premises to another tenant following the first tenant's abandonment), courts have taken this into account in the calculation of damages. Where the subsequent tenant pays more than the abandoning tenant would have paid, the abandoning tenant has not been held responsible as there was no loss suffered by the landlord. See, for example, Toronto Housing Co. v Postal Promotions Ltd.Toronto Housing Co. v Postal Promotions Ltd. (1981), 128 DLR (3d) 51 (Ont.

To be considered for the ¬£10 million award teams must demonstrate, in Scottish waters, a commercially viable wave or tidal stream energy technology \\"that achieves the greatest volume of electrical output over the set minimum hurdle of 100GWh over a continuous 2 year period using only the power of the sea.\\" The Saltire Prize is open to any individual, team or organisation from across the world who believes they have wave or tidal energy technology capable of fulfilling the challenge. Applications can be submitted between March 2010 and January 2015. Already there are five competitors registered. ==Additional prizes== ‚Ä¢ The Saltire Prize Lecture - delivered at the Scottish Renewables Marine Conference every September, it focuses on the challenges in converting our world lead in wave and tidal energy to an industry of commercial scale, and in securing the economic, environmental and social benefits that this industry can bring. The lecture is designed to promote knowledge exchange between academics, industry, financiers and government. ‚Ä¢ The Saltire Prize Medal - created to recognise outstanding contributions to the development of marine renewable energy. The Medal is awarded every March at the Scottish Renewables Annual Conference, Exhibition and Dinner. ‚Ä¢ The Junior Saltire Prize - launched in 2011, this is aimed at primary and secondary school pupils and was designed to help raise awareness of the opportunities that Scotland has to exploit its marine renewables potential. It is sponsored by Skills Development Scotland and awards are presented to teams in three age groups: p5-7, s1-3 and s4-6. ‚Ä¢ A Saltire Prize-sponsored doctorate in collaboration with the Energy Technology Partnership (ETP) - This was announced in August 2012. The research will consider how marine energy projects can be designed to maximise economic energy production while protecting the environment. ‚Ä¢ Power of the Sea - a one off junior photography competition sponsored by the Saltire Prize, aimed at raising awareness of the natural environment and its potential for marine energy. In December 2012, four young photographers from Scottish primary schools were selected by renowned Scottish photographer, David Eustace, as the national winners. ==History== When it was first announced in 2008 it was the world's largest ever single prize for innovation in marine renewable energy. The prize is overseen by the Challenge Committee.

In 2011, he was a finalist in the Metro Art Prize, won the Australian Stencil Art prize in 2010, and in 2008 he won the most popular stencil at Melbourne Stencil Festival. In 2012, Cornish's short film, 'Me- We', which documented the process and construction of his portrait of Father Bob Maguire for entry into the 2012 Archibald Prize, was shortlisted in the Tropfest Awards Film Festival. Other notable achievements include being selected for 2012's Project 5 charity auction, a large involvement in 2011's Outpost Project. Cornish has exhibited his work in capital and regional cities in Australia, and in major international cultural centres, including Paris, London, Rome, Los Angeles and Amsterdam. ==Career== Stencil art by E.L.K in Wolf Lane, Perth Growing up in Canberra, Cornish worked as a sign writer and landscape designer before taking up stencil art as a hobby in the early-2000s. All of his work is done by hand through cutting out sheets of recycled acetate with a scalpel. Some of Cornish's stencils contain over 100 layers and up to 243 colours. The subject of his 2012 Archibald final work, Father Bob Maguire, contains over 30 layers and the work was influenced by Cornish's association of Maguire with his own grandfather. Being an atheist, religious iconography occurs frequently in his work. Cornish's portrait of the controversial Catholic priest achieved a new auction record for a work by an Australian street artist selling for A$34,160 during the Bonhams Australia Important Australian Art auction in late 2013. Cornish has made multiple visits to Syria, Lebanon and Iran. In early 2017 he co-founded the 'For Syrias Children' Charity organisation, which works in conjunction with Non-Government Organisations on the ground in Syria, raising funds for Syrian children affected by conflict. In 2017 Cornish curated an urban art auction to raise funds for the children of Syria. Cornish currently lives and works in Sydney. His work is held in public and private collections around the world, most notably his portrait of former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke, which was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery of Australia in 2013. == Exhibition history (solo shows) == *2018: No place like home, Tuggeranong art centre, Canberra *2017: Zero to the left, Metro Gallery, Melbourne *2017: Road to Damascus, Nanda\\\\Hobbs Contemporary, Sydney *2016: Vanishing Point, Nanda\\\\Hobbs Contemporary, Sydney *2016: Concrete Jungle, Metro Gallery, Melbourne *2014: Louder than words, Stolen Space, London *2014: Clusterfuck, Metro Gallery, Melbourne *2014: Sex & Death, w/ Will Coles, Art Equity, Sydney *2013: Before Afghanistan, Art Equity, Sydney *2012: Not with it..., Metro Gallery, Melbourne *2011: Look what you made me do...., Brunswick Street Gallery, Melbourne *2011: This is why we can't have nice things..., Oh really Gallery, Newtown, Sydney *2010: How you like me now Bitch?, Front Gallery, Canberra == Awards and collections == *2019: Archibald Prize, Finalist *2018: Salon de Refus√©s, SH Ervine Gallery, Sydney *2017: Salon de Refus√©s, SH Ervine Gallery, Sydney (Winner: Holding Redlich People's Choice Award) *2016: Australian War Memorial, Canberra (acquisition) *2015: Gold Coast Art Gallery, QLD (acquisition) *2014: Bond University Collection, QLD *2014: Corrigan Collection *2013: Churchill Fellowship, Awardee *2013: National Portrait Gallery, Canberra (acquisition) *2013: Sulman prize, Finalist *2012: Moran Portrait prize, semi-finalist *2012: Archibald prize, Finalist *2012: Tropfest, shortlisted *2011: Metro Art Prize, Finalist *2010: Australian Stencil Art Prize, Winner *2009: Ballarat Gallery of Modern Art (acquisition) *2009: Australian Stencil art prize, Runner up *2008: Melbourne Stencil Festival, Peoples choice == References  External links == * * Category:1979 births Category:Australian graffiti artists Category:Living people Category:Archibald Prize Salon des Refus√©s People's Choice Award winners Category:Archibald Prize Salon des Refus√©s Category:Archibald Prize finalists Category:Artists from the Australian Capital Territory ","title":"Luke Cornish"},{"id":"35248573","text":"Satluj De Kandhe (), also spelled as Satluj De Kande, is a 1964 National Award winning Punjabi romantic film directed by M.

The following hospitals and institutes are under the college: * Hamidia Hospital * Sultania Zanana Hospital * Kamla Nehru Hospital * Regional Institute of Ophthalmology * National Institute For Research in Environmental Health * Cardiac Science Center * Medico-Legal Institute * Trauma & emergency Center * State Virology Laboratory ==Location== GMC is in the Fatehgarh area on Sultania Road in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. The college stands tall on the ground where once Fatehgarh Fort stood. It is adjacent to VIP Road, which is a major tourist attraction due to the beauty and serenity of the Upper Lake. Many scenes from Bollywood movies like Rajneeti and Arakshan have been shot here. In front of the campus is one of the largest mosques in Asia, the Tajul Masjid with its Motia Talab. GMC at Upper Lake ==History== Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal was inaugurated on 13 August 1955 by Pt. Lal Bahadur Shastri. The college started its functioning in the building of the Polytechnic College with its first batch of 50 students and two departments: Anatomy and Physiology. The first Principal in 1955 was Dr. S.C. Sinha. The boys hostel was in the present Jehanuma Palace Hotel and the girls hostel was bracketed with the MLB college girls hostel at Banganga. GMC, bhopal After one year the foundation of an independent building was laid by Union Minister of Home Shri Govind Ballabh Pant on 15 September 1956. It took seven years to complete the task. This beautiful piece of architecture and craftsmanship came into existence, housed in the historic Fort of Fatehgarh, to be inaugurated by the first Prime Minister of India Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, on 13 March 1963, when a galaxy of celebrities were on the dais- Begum Sajida Sultan of Bhopal, Governor Shri H.V. Pataskar, Chief Minister Shri B.R. Mandloi, Health Minister Mr. M.P. Dubey and Principal Dr. R.P. Singh. Where the Fatehgarh Fort stood in 1722, now stands Gandhi Medical College. The former fought the enemy and the latter fights diseases. Inauguration of Lady Lansdowne Hospital for women, now known as the Sultania Zanana Hospital The foundation stone of the surgical and medical wards (Kamla Nehru Block known as KNB wards) was laid by Rajkumari Amrit Kaur the then Union Health Minister on 6 March 1955. Girls were shifted to the nurses hostel and later the nurses hostel had to be shifted to another building though just opposite where it stands today. Innovative Principal with new ideas that Dr. R.P. Singh was, he designed the layout of the boy's hostel on the pattern of a two tier system which was probably the first of its kind at that time. The foundation stone of this brain child of Dr. R.P. Singh was laid by King of Nepal Maharaj Mahendra Bir Vikram Shah Deo on 18 November 1955. Hospitals for men and women were established as Prince of Wales Hospital for men and Lady Linlithgo Lansdowne Hospital for women respectively. True to the saying \\"old order changeth yielding place to new\\", the hospital changed names with change of reigns. Price of Wales Hospital became Hamidia Hospital and Lady Linlithgo became Sultania Zanana Hospital. Both are integral parts of Gandhi Medical College today. Lady Bhore Centre opposite Fire Brigade, Fatehgarh caters to antenatal and child welfare activities in addition to preventive and social medical counseling. == Campus == The campus building is housed in Fort of Fatehgarh which was inaugurated by the first Prime Minister of India Pt.

Admission to post- graduate courses (MS/MD) is through NEET-PG and in-service candidates of Govt. of Madhya Pradesh. ==Medico-Legal Institute== The survey committee constituted in 1964 by the government of India considered that essential mission of a medicolegal institute should be to train the medical jurists, because for the lack of competent man in India, the application of forensic medicine has become illusory. The Mudalier committee in 1962 has recommended the creation of a separate cadre of specially trained medical jurists to look after the work of the state. An important step in the development of medicolegal services in India would be the establishment of a Central Medicolegal Institute and the State Medicolegal Institutes functioning as Department of Forensic Medicine in Medical Colleges in the capital cities of the states. The government of Madhya Pradesh took a serious note of the recommendations in 1965. Consequently, the government of Madhya Pradesh created the 'First Medico-legal Institute in India' at its capital city Bhopal in 1977. The Medico-legal Institute played a very important role in the management of the biggest man-made disaster in history, which claimed the lives of thousands and left hundreds with disabilities, that took place in Bhopal when a poisonous gas (MIC, methyl isocyanate) leaked from one of the storage tanks of the Union Carbide factory on the night of 2‚Äì3 December 1984. Postmortem examinations were conducted on many of the dead bodies and an intelligent step was taken by preserving all the body tissues and fluids for the further chemical examination as nobody was aware of as to what gas/gases have been inhaled by the people. These preserved tissues (at -20 ¬∞C and -70 ¬∞C) started paying dividends in the form of answers to many of the puzzling questions through chemical tests. ==National Institute for Research in Environmental Health== National Institute for Research in Environmental Health Scope of activities National Institute for Research in Environmental Health (NIREH), Bhopal, is one of the permanent institutes of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), a government of India‚Äôs apex autonomous organization for bio- medical research in the country.

It was built in the nineteenth century by architect Duncan Macleod, under the reign of Nawab Nazim Humayun Jah of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa (1824‚Äì1838). The foundation stone of the palace was laid on 9 August 1829, and that very day the construction work was started. William Cavendish was the then Governor-General. Now, Hazarduari Palace is the most conspicuous building in Murshidabad. It has also become a tourist attraction all over India. In 1985, the palace was handed over to the Archaeological Survey of India for better preservation.

It was located on the present site of the Hazarduari Palace, on the banks of the Bhagirathi River. The fort was demolished to build this grand palace. Now, Kila Nizamat refers to the campus where the palace is located along with the Nizamat Imambara, Murshidabad Clock Tower, Madina Mosque, Chawk Masjid, Bacchawali Tope, the Shia Complex, Wasif Manzil, the two Zurud Mosques - one on the east of the palace and the other one between the Wasif Manzil and the south gate of the palace - and the Nawab Bahadur's Institution (or, Nizamat College) surrounding it. Tourists call the Hazarduari Palace the Nizamat Kila or the Kila Nizamat. ==Construction== The palace was built and designed under the supervision of Colonel Duncan MacLeod of the Bengal Corps of Engineers. He was the father of Sir Donald McLeod. The foundation stone of the palace was laid by Nawab Nazim Humayun Jah of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa (1824‚Äì1838) on August 29, 1829, and that very day the construction work was started. The construction was completed in December 1837. Incident The concrete bed on which the foundation stone was to be laid was built so deep that the Nawab had to use a ladder to descend. The suffocating atmosphere created due to the large concourse of people, which stood surrounding them, caused His Highness to faint. The foundation stone was laid after he was brought up. ==Etymology== The name of the palace that is Hazarduari means \\"a palace with a thousand doors\\". Hazar means \\"thousand\\" and Duari means \\"the one with doors\\"; thus, the total sums up to \\"the one with a thousand doors\\". The palace earlier known as Bara Kothi has been named so as the palace has in all 1000 doors, of which 100 are false. They were built so that if any predator tried to do something wrong and escape, he would be confused between the false and real doors, and by that time he would be caught by the Nawab's guards. ==Palace== The Bhagirathi River which flows just beside Hazarduari palace The enclosure where the palace is situated is known as Kila Nizamat or Nizamat Kila. The campus except this palace, has in addition the Nizamat Imambara, Wasif Manzil, the Bachhawali Tope, Murshidabad Clock Tower, three mosques out of which one is the Madina Mosque, and the Nawab Bahadur's Institution. Other buildings include residential quarters. It is situated on the east bank of the Bhagirathi River, which flows just beside it. The gap between the Bhagirathi's banks and the palace is just ; however, the foundations are laid very deep, which protect the palace. The palace is rectangular in plan (130 meters long and 61 meters broad) and is a good example of Indo-European architecture. The front facade of the palace, which has the grand staircase, faces north. This staircase is perhaps the biggest one in India. The palace has 1000 doors, of which 100 are false, and a total of 114 rooms. The wooden Nizamat Imambara built by Siraj ud-Daulah caught fire in 1846, so the present building was rebuilt within a year in 1848 by Nawab Nazim Feradun Jah of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. This Imambara is the biggest one in India. More than 6 lacs were spent for its construction. The Madina Mosque is kept open for a look at the Muharram festival by the general public but is kept closed throughout the year. The Bacchawali Tope which lies in the campus of Kila Nizamat was brought by Murshid Quli Khan. This cannon has been placed on high altar and its mouth has been covered up with an iron plate. It is said that when used it made such a huge noise that it forced pregnant women to give birth to babies at that very time. Hazarduari Palace The palace was used to hold durbars (official or royal meetings) and official works between the Nawabs and the Britishers and also used as a residence for high-ranking British officers. It has now been transformed into a museum which houses collection from the Nawabs like priceless paintings, furniture, antiques. A grand flight of stairs of 37 steps of stone, the lowermost one of which is long, leads up to the palace's upper portico. Perhaps it is the largest one in India. The pediment of the palace is supported by 7 huge pillars, each being at the base. There is also the Nawabi Coat of Arms depicted on the pediment. This grand staircase is perhaps the biggest one in India. On either side at the beginning of the grand staircase are two statues of two seated masonry Victorian lions with stone slabs embedded in the wall behind them. There are several large gates used as an entrance to the palace some which bear names like the Imambara, Chawk and Dakshin Darwaza (south gate). The main gates have Naubat Khanas (musicians' galleries) over them and are large enough that an elephant may pass with a howdah on its back. ==Museum== Photos from Hazarduari Palace with the palace's chandelier in the center. This chandelier is the second largest in the world after that in the Buckingham Palace. The clock tower with the palace in the backdrop The palace has now been transformed into a museum which houses collections from the Nawabs like priceless paintings, furniture, antiques and so on. The famous one is the mirror and the chandelier. In 1985, the palace was handed over to the Archaeological Survey of India for better preservation. The Hazarduari Palace Museum is regarded as the biggest site museum of Archaeological Survey of India and has got 20 displayed galleries containing 4742 antiquities out of which 1034 has been displayed for the public. The antiquities include various weapons, oil paintings of Dutch, French and Italian artists, marble statues, metal objects, porcelain and stucco statues, farmans, rare books, old maps, manuscripts, land revenue records, palanquins mostly belonging to eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a bamboo from Assam and so on. The Durbar Hall of the palace which houses the furniture used by the Nawab has a crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling. It is the second largest chandelier in the world, after one in Buckingham Palace. It was given to the Nawab by Queen Victoria. There are also two pairs of mirrors in the museum, that are placed at an angle of 90 degrees in such a way that one cannot see one's own face but others can see. It was used by the Nawab to prevent predators from harming him, and was kept at a place so that the predator cannot see his face and think a mirror to be there but the Nawab could and he would be caught. Museum galleries A painting of the Nizamat Fort Campus with the palace and the other surrounding buildings (c. 1830s ‚Äì 1840s), kept in the British Library, painting by Robert Smith In the entrance porch there are two carriages, of which one is a camel carriage and the other is a Victorian carriage. Both of them were used by the Nawabs. The lobby has been decorated with photographs of several buildings of historical importance and it also has a huge stuffed crocodile and a thick bamboo from Assam. There in all 20 galleries as follows: * Gallery no. 1 and 2 also known as Armoury wing A and B houses the armoury. This gallery is rich in technical skills and is used to display the various weapons like knives, guns, pistols, revolvers, cannons, lances, spears, shields, bows, arrows, rifles and so on. They are inscribed with verses from the Quran. Some weapons which need special attention are the Jamadhara and a bifurcated sword known as Zulfikar. Both of them are associated with Mir Qasim. Some of the other most important artifacts are the swords of Alivardi Khan, Siraj ud-Daulah and so on. The dagger by which Muhammad i-Beg killed Siraj ud-Daulah can also be seen here. The magic mirrors (as discussed above) are kept just outside the gallery on the landing area of the staircase which leads to the upper floors. A huge cannon known as the Dutch cannon can be seen here which was given to Alivardi Khan by the Dutch Government in 1745. It is generally known as the Mir madan Cannon. Mir Madan was a trusted lieutenant of Siraj ud-Daulah who died in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 due to the bursting of this cannon. * Gallery no. 3 is the gallery of Royal Exhibits. It houses several paintings and objects of silver and gold and several statues each of historical, political and religious importance.

It is the center attraction of the palace cum museum. It is circular in plan and has four doors at the cardinal points, some of which-as mentioned above-are fake. The Durbar also has a vaulted roof with the crystal chandelier (as discussed above, is perhaps the second largest in the world after the one at the Buckingham Palace) hung from the ceiling. It was presented to the Nawab by Queen Victoria. Earlier when there was no electricity the chandelier was lit by 1001 candles; at present it is lit by 96 bulbs.

Natesa Iyer (11 November 1880 ‚Äì 23 January 1963) was an Indian activist in the Indian National Congress during the Indian independence movement. He was also one of the pioneers of modern Tamil drama and Tamil cinema. He was a talent scout who recognized merit and promoted many youngsters, who went on to become great performers in Carnatic music. ==Early life and background== Natesa Iyer was born on 11 November 1880, to Janakiammaiyar Sastri (Pudukkotamma) and Gangadhara Shastri: who was the legal advisor to the then Pudukkottai state, a Princely state in the Indian subcontinent under the British colonial rule. Iyer's elder brother was Rao Saheb G. Ganapati Sastriar who went on to hold the position of Dewan of the Pudukottai state. The family claimed lineage from Appayya Dikshita. Iyer's love for music and theatre made him run away from home at the age of ten, to join the railways as a clerk in the Madura and Tinnevelly - Quilon Railways construction department.F.G. Natesa Iyer [330] \\\\- $.5.00 : Sruti, A Monthly Magazine on Indian Performing Arts In an article written by his grandson, it is claimed that as a child, \\" He took shelter with Englishmen who brought him up and converted him to Christianity. Twenty years later, dissatisfied with the ability of the priests to clarify his doubts, he met the Kanchi Shankaracharya, and, getting satisfactory answers from him, reconverted to Hinduism.\\" . The Shankaracharya referred to was Paramacharya Chandrashekarendra Saraswati. It is recorded in a conversation he had in June 1923, that based on his twenty years of experience and knowledge on the Christian religion, \\"the Hindu religion was our mother and it was not appropriate to abandon your mother.\\" Iyer also is reported to have stated that he was unfortunate to have committed such a sin, but realized his folly in time and he did notlike to see anyone else commit the same mistake. ==Public career== Iyer spent much of his formal career as a railway officer with the South Indian Railway Company (S. I. R). He retired as a District Traffic Superintendent in 1935, the first Indian to occupy this position. The company was incorporated in England, with the stocks and shares quoted on the London Stock Exchange. South Indian Railway had its administrative headquarters at Tiruchirappalli. Iyer built his house in Tiruchirappalli and spent much of his life in this city. Iyer was a member of the Indian Congress party and represented the city as a delegate to the annual Indian National Congress sessions during the years of World War I. He joined the Indian National Congressin the year 1914, and was a delegate at the sessions in Bombay (1915), Lucknow (1916), and Madras (1917). In the Lucknow session he was a member of Subjects Committee and took part in the discussion on the Congress - Indian Muslim League scheme of reforms. At its Madras session in 1917, he was a delegate from Trichinopoly, an elected member of the All India Congress Committee, a member of the Subjects Committee and had the honour of moving the resolution on indentured labour at the open sessions. He was a supporter of the Indian Home Rule Movement of those years and a party to the passive resistance resolution passed at the Madras Provincial Conference following the internment of Mrs.Annie Besant and George Arundale and B. P. Wadia. Iyer was the district commissioner of the Boy Scouts Association in India in 1922. In this capacity he was presented to the then Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) at the World Scout Jamboree held at Madras. Iyer has been credited to being \\"the first elected Indian chairman of Tiruchi Municipality.\\" He was elected councillor of Trichnopoly Municipal Council for a number of years. A research paper on Tamil revivalism in the 1930s, described Iyer as a leader of importance, who had been \\"an autocratic but effective chairman of the Trichnopoly municipality in the 1920s\\". His notability in those years between the two world wars could perhaps be assessed by his appearance in the \\"Who's who in Madras Presidency\\" in 1937. He continued to take some interest commenting on the Indian Congress politics in the city till the decade of the 1950s.The Hindu : dated 25 September 1951: George VI undergoes surgery ==Personal belief and faith== Iyer was very close to Advaita Vedanta scholars and saints like Chandrashekarendra Saraswati. The Indian National Congress, in the decade of the 1920s, started organising the Non-Cooperation Movement, which involved getting many people to protest on the streets. F.G. Natesa Iyer, the leading Congress activist of Tiruchirappalli then, as also the elected Mayor, took this opportunity to convert the movement to also show support for the Chandrashekarendra Saraswati. He described the occasion, thus: \\"I was nominated by the public as the chairman of the Reception committee for arranging a reception for the Acharya of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam. As the municipal chairman , it was my duty to provide a proper welcome and respect to Swamigal who was visiting after a long time. The opportunity to welcome His Holiness in a manner that was exponentially greater than receptions given to kings and viceroys, was accorded to me, along my with supporters Sri MKandaswamy Servai, lawyer Sri. R. Srinivasa Iyengar and the larger public. The procession that was seven miles long, was preceded by seven groups of nadaswaram players, three band groups, four elephants, many horses and camels, instrumental players, Bhajan singers, Seva Samitis. I had the blessing to hold the front side of the ivory palanquin where our guru for the whole world , Sri Sankaracharya Swamigal was seated. He gave darshan to numerous people lined on both sides of the roads, in every floor, irrespective of their religion, caste or creed. There was no count of arathis, Poorna kumbams, garlands, asthika goshams. The procession that started at 6 pm ended at 10 pm in front of the mutt at Thiruvanaikaval. I was enthralled in my service to Swamigal as service to Lord Shiva himself\\". Iyer also appears to have had a good rapport with Ramana Maharshi and his ashram. Iyer also was an admirer of Sivananda Saraswati. His homage is printed in a publication brought out by the Divine Life Society. It can perhaps be inferred that Iyer belonged to the Smarta Tradition of the Vadama sub-sect of the Iyer community of Tamil Brahmins : who based their personal philosophy on Advaita Vedanta. The claim of lineage from Appayya Dikshita: who was a noted expositor and practitioner of the Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, with a focus on Shiva: perhaps is further evidence of Iyer's personal philosophy. ==Theatre== Iyer is credited with being the founder of an amateur theater group, Rasika Ranjana Sabha, in Tiruchirappalli in 1914. . The Rasika Ranjana Sabha has been historically classified along with the Madras-based Suguna Vilasa Sabha, the Kumbakonam- based Vani Vilas Sabha and Thanjavur-based Sudarshan Sabha - for encouraging native \\"histrionic talent\\" in the Madras Presidency, during the times when the British Raj ruled. There exists some records, on the English plays staged by the Rasika Ranjana Sabha. In 1915 at the Trichinopoly Collector‚Äôs bungalow, Sheridan‚Äôs play ‚ÄòPizzaro‚Äô was enacted in aid of the Ladies‚Äô War Fund. The predominantly British audience were stated to have been amazed at the excellent diction of the all Tamil cast. In 1918, two plays were staged as part of the peace celebrations organised by the Carnatic Infantry. In 1918, \\"At Home\\" was given to Mr. Blackstone, Deputy Superintendent of Police and the same drama troupe presented a few plays. Iyer specialised in Shakespearean roles like those of Hamlet, and Othello.F.G. Natesa Iyer - Soliloquies from Shakespeare's Plays mp3 download forum music-db.org He was also famous for his production, and acting in Tamil social and mythological plays. In a recent foundation day celebration of the RR Sabha, he was hailed the \\"Father of modern Tamil dramas\\". There is a version that he organised the first ever public concert of M. S. Subbulakshmi, when she was eleven years of age: in the 100 pillar hall inside the Rockfort Temple, Tiruchirappalli; with Mysore Chowdiah on the violin and Dakshinamurthy Pillai on the mridanga.Sruti magazine cover story on Iyer, page 20, issue number 330, March 2012 Actors like T.K.S. Brothers, M. G. Ramachandran, M. R. Radha and M. K. Radha in the starting days of their career, have been documented to have looked up to Iyer as their ideal, and sought his help in furthering their talents and prospects. It is reported that the TKS brothers got their first big break in the world of theatre - through Natesa Iyer casting them in the roles of Lava and Kusha, in a similarly named play produced and staged by Rasika Ranjana Sabha.Sruti magazine cover story on Iyer, page 25, issue number 330, March 2012http://columbuscarnatic.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fgn.pdf Iyer had written a concept paper for an academy of dance, drama and music, presented at the All India Oriental Conference (Hyderabad session); in the pre independence days. This seems to be one of the precursory inputs to the Sangeet Natak Akademi: which has as its English name, The National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama. ==Talent spotting== Iyer is credited with spotting the talent of the first \\"superstar of South Indian cinema\\", M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar. One story is that he heard the young boy, Thyagaja singing at a bhajan. Impressed with his talent, Iyer offered him the role of \\"Lohitadasa\\" in his play Harischandra; with the permission of Thyagaraja's father. Thyagaraja, who was ten at the time, agreed, and the play was a success. Through Rasika Ranjana Sabha, he also started getting trained under the guidance of theater veterans at that time in Trichy. Some stories also attribute him to have spotted the talent of K. B. Sundarambal; who as a child, earned her living through begging and singing in railway trains, for alms and copper coins around Trichy. There are also stories that Iyer organised the first ever public concert of M.S. Subbulakshmi. This was apparently in 1927, when Subbulaxmi was eleven years old. The performance was arranged in the 100 pillar hall inside theRockfort Temple, Tiruchirappalli; with Mysore Chowdiah on the violin and Dakshinamurthy Pillai on the Mridangam.SRUTI magazine cover story on F.G. Natesa Iyer, page 25, issue number 330, March 2012 An article on Natesa Iyer claimed that well known Carnatic artistes like \\"Marungapuri Gopalakrishna Iyer, Madurai Mani, Palghat Mani, and Semmangudi, owed much to him for their success in their early careers\\". Specifically, there is a reference to Natesa Iyer spotting the talent of Musiri Subramania Iyer: in 1916, when Musiri was seventeen years old, at his inaugural concert in Trichy. Natesa Iyer presented Musiri with a gold medal, at his inaugural concert, and predicted a bright future. ==Seva Sadanam== Iyer acted in one Tamil movie Seva Sadanam. This movie was directed by K. Subramanyam in the year 1938. Seva Sadanam was an adaptation of Bazaar-e-Husn, a novel written by Premchand. Iyer played the lead role of \\"Eashwara Iyer\\", opposite M. S. Subbulakshmi who starred in the movie as \\"Sumathi\\". This was M.S. Subbulakshmi's debut to the world of cinema. The film became famous for its social reform agenda. The veteran Marxist leader N. Sankaraiah described Seva Sadhanam as an \\"unusual film\\" for choosing the subject of marriages between young girls and old men (which had social sanction). According to him, the film successfully brought out the \\"sufferings of the girl\\" and the \\"mental agony of the aged husband\\". Sankariah particularly appreciated Iyer's performance in the role of the old man, which he said \\" was impressive\\".Vishwanathan S. \\"A progressive film maker; Tribute to K. Subramanian\\", Volume 21 - Issue 14, 3-16 July 2004 of Frontline magazine, (brought out by Hindu publications), Chennai, Tamilnadu. In one sequence, Iyer is struck with remorse and throws away in sheer disgust his Yagnopaveetham; the sacred threads a Brahmin wears as an iconic symbol of his faith and community.Guy Randor \\"Blast from the past, Seva Sadanam 1938\\", in Cinema Plus of the Hindu, Friday issue 1 February 2008.(brought out by Hindu publications), Chennai, Tamilnadu. ==Death and legacy== Iyer died at the house of his daughter Tirupurasundari at Bhopal, in January 1963. His body was cremated at Ram Ghat in the Bhopal Lake with military honours. Iyer's role as Eashwar Iyer, the aged husband to the young Sumathi, played by M. S. Subbulakshmi in the Tamil movie Sevasadanam has been stated to be \\" a turning point in the history of Tamil cinema. In the climax, the aged husband, now a totally changed man, was shown as casting aside with utter contempt his \`sacred thread', which symbolises his Brahmin superiority. It came as a stunning blow to the then Brahmin orthodoxy\\"(in pre independent South India, which was socially dominated by the Brahmin community). The precocious child talent he unearthed and shaped through Rasika Ranjana Sabha; like M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar and K. B. Sundarambal; turned out to be the first superstars of Tamil cinema. He is credited with providing the first break for public performances, for well known artistes like M. S. Subbulakshmi and TKS Brothers, when they were yet adolescents. His name has been associated with promoting concert talent in Carnatic music; of what would become some of the well names of the twentieth century - Marungapuri Gopalakrishna Iyer, Musiri Subramania Iyer, Madurai Mani Iyer, Palghat Mani Iyer, and Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer. Perhaps his biggest legacy would be the Rasika Ranjana Sabha, which he founded in Tiruchirappalli, and into which he poured much of his wealth. The Sabha celebrated its centenary of existence in a year long celebration across 2015-16 == Rasika Ranjana Sabha== The Sabha got an award for the best Sabha in mofussil centre in 2011-12. This award was given by the leading social worker Sarojini Varadappan: in her capacity as Chairperson of the Mylapore Academy- for staging the maximum number of dramas in the entire state of Tamil nadu for the year 2011-12. The Sabha organises a special function on Iyer's birth anniversary; to honor well known personalities in the field of music, dance and culture. In the foundation day ceremony of 2011, he was hailed as the \\"Father of modern Tamil dramas\\". Veteran Tamil theater actors credit Rasika Ranjana Sabha, for ensuring the survival of the Tamil theater art form, in the 21st century, amidst competition from television and cinema. The RR Sabha has been conducting music competitions since 1984 to encourage students learning both vocal and instrumental music.

Mr. A. Natarajan, former Chennai station Director of Doordarshan observed in a function at the Sabha in 2008, that \\"RR Sabha had been supporting aspiring singers in tier II cities and providing a chance to the music-lovers of the city to attend the concerts of ace musicians.\\" At the inauguration of the centenary celebrations of the Rasika Ranjana Sabha, on 16 May 2015, a special function was organised to release special postmark and special envelope by the Indian Post. The speakers paid rich tributes to Natesa Iyer for his outstanding contribution to the promotion of drama, art, and culture. They recalled the efforts made by the late Natesa Iyer in providing opportunities to the young drama artists and musicians, realising the impact of fine arts on the mind and soul of the masses. Mr. G. Natarajan, Director of Postal Services (Central region), noted that Natesa Iyer had groomed great artists, including S.G. Kittappa, M.K. Thiyagaraja Bhagavathar, and T.R. Mahalingam.the late Natesa Iyer had taken a long term vision by founding the sabha. The sabha had groomed a number of artists in their early career to such an extent that they turned to be popular artists later. It was stated that the RR sabha formed part of the history of Tiruchi. The valedictory function of the centenary celebration, on Saturday 2 April 2016, saw more praise for the Rasika Ranjana Sabha. The role being played by Rasika Ranjana Sabha in promoting art and culture was highlighted by speakers. They said the sabha has set a new trend in conservation and promotion of art and culture among the different age-groups. Chitra Visweswaran, member secretary, Tamil Nadu Iyal Isai Nataka Mandram, delivered the valedictory address. She summed up the achievements of the Rasika Ranjana Sabha thus: \\"Apart from honouring artistes, the sabha has been instrumental in recognising the services of institutions by presenting awards or citation to All India Radio and Tiruchi District Drama Artistes Association. The sabha had not confined itself to any particular art but has been encouraging artistes belonging to different planes such as Hari Katha discourse exponents, kaniyan koothu, Nama sangeerthanam and various dying arts. The sustained effort by the Sabha for over a century in organising concerts and encouraging artistes was its specific achievement\\" M. S. Mohamed Masthan, noted drama artiste, observed in this valedictory function;\\" The sabha has been a catalyst for the drama artistes in nurturing their talents and the annual week-long drama festival has been a gift to the artistes\\". Next to Chennai, Tiruchi has (become) a prominent seat of promoting art and culture among the Tier II cities in the state. == References  External links == * * Category:1880 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Indian independence activists from Tamil Nadu Category:Politicians from Tiruchirappalli Category:Indian male film actors Category:Indian Tamil people Category:Tamil male actors Category:Indian National Congress politicians from Tamil Nadu Category:Male actors from Tamil Nadu Category:Indian actor-politicians ","title":"F.

Prior to the operation, breathing primarily occurs through the nasal airways. In the upper airways, the inhaled air is warmed up or cooled down, to prepare the optimal temperature before the air reaches the lungs. After a total laryngectomy, the upper airways are bypassed and breathing in and out occurs through the tracheostoma in the neck which means that the inhaled air flows directly into the lungs. These anatomical changes lead, among others, to changes in voice production, breathing, and olfaction. The nasal functions of regulating the temperature, humidifying, and filtering of the inhaled air are lost. The lack of these functions impairs the lower airways and the activity of the cilia, which leads to pulmonary problems such as tracheobronchial mucus, excessive sputum production, crusting, which can also cause fatigue and shortness of breath. To at least partially reduce these restrictions and compensate the nasal functions, an HME cassette can be attached over the tracheostoma to provide a means for conditioning, humidifying and to a certain extent filtering the inhaled air. ==Pulmonary function rehabilitation== With the regular use of an HME cassette over a couple of weeks, the pulmonary functions can be significantly improved in the majority of patients regarding reduced sputum production, reduced forced expectoration in order to clear the airways, and thereby reduced stoma cleaning. This is due to improved ventilation and blood oxygenation values, which leads to a better ciliary activity and thus more efficient coughing for mucus clearance from the trachea. Studies show that with regular and enduring use of an HME cassette, pulmonary complaints decrease, regardless of country and climate. These improvements can affect voice pitch, loudness and intelligibility, and on sleeping disorders and fatigue, which is often related to pulmonary problems. ==Attachment== HME devices can be attached to the tracheostoma in two different ways: peristomally, by use of a base plate, to which the HME can be attached, and intraluminally, by putting the HME into a laryngectomy tube or a stoma button. Adhesive baseplates come in different shapes and properties to meet the users‚Äô differences in anatomy and skin types. Peristomally through an adhesive on the neck surrounding the stoma There is a variety of adhesive baseplates, that can be used to attach the HME and products that are recommended for proper application and removal of the adhesive complement the portfolio. Intraluminally through a device that is inserted into the tracheostoma Some laryngectomized patients require a laryngectomy tube to maintain stoma patency, especially in the early postsurgical days and during postoperative radiotherapy. A stoma button is primarily used in stomas that are shrinking. This is the preferred solution for many users, but there has to be a tight lip that holds the button in place. ==Device lifetime== Most patients use one adhesive per day and 1-2 HME cassettes per day. ==Voice prosthesis and HME== An individual combination of voice prosthesis, HME, and attachment is important for good speech and pulmonary rehabilitation. ==References== Category:Prosthetics Category:Human head and neck Category:Larynx surgery Category:Trachea surgery ","title":"Heat and moisture exchanger after laryngectomy"},{"id":"35248978","text":"In Greek mythology, Co√∂n (Ancient Greek: ŒöœåœâŒΩ, gen.

She committed self-immolation at the sacrificial fire of a yagna performed by her father Daksha as she felt seriously distraught by her father's insult of her husband and also to her by not inviting both of them for the yagna. Shiva was so grieved after hearing of the death of his wife that he danced around the world in a Tandav Nritya (\\"devastating penance\\" or dance of destruction) carrying Sati's dead body over his shoulders. Perturbed by this situation and in order to bring Shiv to a state of normalcy, it was then Vishnu who decided to use his Sudarshan Chakra (the rotating knife s carried on his finger tip). He dismembered Sati's body with the chakra into several pieces and wherever her body fell on the earth, the place was consecrated as a divine shrine oo Shakthi Peeth with deities of Sati (Parvati) and Shiva.

The Paraujano live by Lake Maracaibo, Zulia State, in Northwest Venezuela. ==General Information== The Paraujanos call themselves the AnuÕÇ or AnuÕÇn (means ‚Äòhuman being), which is a self-denomination of the people. 'Paraujano' is better known in ethnographic literature.They received the name Paraujano from the neighboring Guajiros. The combination of palaa, meaning ‚Äòsea‚Äô, and anuÕÇ literally means ‚Äòpeople of the sea‚Äô, or fishermen. The Paraujano live in palafittes and are skilled at fishing and boating. According to a 2011 census, more than 21,000 people identify as Paraujano. Classification Paraujano is a Northern Arawakan, or Maipuran, language. It is derived from Gaujiro, yet is a distinct language and not a dialect of Gaujiro. The two languages are closely related. According to lexicostatistical analysis conducted by Oliver (1989) the two languages must have diverged around A.D. 900. Status and Speakers Paraujano is critically endangered and nearly extinct. The Maracaibo region began transforming into a largely populated industrial center in the early 1900s, as petroleum was extracted from the Maracaibo Lake. As the Paraujano mingled with others early on, their language was spread and spoken by some newcomers. However, by the 1970s there were only thirteen speakers remaining. As of 2014, there is one surviving fluent speaker, a thirty-year-old by the name of Yofri M√°rquez, who learned the language from his grandmother. There are a few partial speakers, most of whom are elderly. Revitalization efforts include Paraujano instruction in six regional elementary schools and the establishment of various cultural organizations. ==Lexicon== Paraujano has incorporated some Spanish words into its vocabulary. Out the eighty-nine available words from the Swadesh list, six are Spanish substitutes. ==Phonology== The Paraujano phoneme contains 14 pulmonic consonants and 11 vowels. {  - ! !!Bilabial !! Alveolar !! Post-alveolar !! Palatal !! Velar !! Glottal - ! Stop/Affricate  p  t  t É   k  - !Fricative     É    h - !Nasal  m  n   …≤   - !Approximant     j  w  - !Tap, Flap   …æ     - !Lateral   l     } {  - ! !!Front !! Central !! Back - !High  i i:  …® …®:  u u: - !Mid  e e:   o o: - !Low    } The Paraujano phoneme differs from closely related Guajiro, mainly in vowels and due to the incorporation of Spanish lexicon. There are a number of allophones in Paraujano. Among these allophones, there is a tendency toward palatization or nasalization. ==See also== Maracaibo Basin Wayuu people ==ReferencesFurther reading== Taylor, D. (1960).

Category:Apinae Category:Bee tribes ","title":"Ancylaini"},{"id":"35249370","text":"Yawalapiti (Jaulapiti) is an Arawakan language of Brazil. The Agavotaguerra (Agavotoqueng) reportedly spoke the same language.Hammarstr√∂m (2015) Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: a comprehensive review: online appendices Speakers of the language live in a village along the edge of the river Tuatuari, a tributary of the Kuluene River, located in the southern part of the Xingu Indigenous Park (Upper Xingu), in the state of Mato Grosso.. ==Phonology== Consonants Yawalapiti and Waur√°, an Arawakan language belonging to the same subgroup, share a very similar phonemic inventory. The main segments are classified in the following table. {   +Yawalapiti consonant phonemes. ! !! Bilabial !! Alveolar !! Retroflex !! Postalveolar !! Palatal !! Velar !! Glottal - ! Plosive      ()   - ! Affricate        - ! Fricative        - ! Nasal        - ! Lateral        - ! Vibrant        - ! Flap        - ! Approximant        } There are no voiced plosives or affricates in the language. The palatal appears to be an allophone of occurring before the front vowel , e.g. [puÀàluka] \\"countryside\\" vs. [naÀàci…æu] \\"my aunt\\". Also, the fricative is in free variation with its voiced counterpart and respectively, e.g. [iÀà Ça ~ iÀà êa] \\"canoe\\".. There are also some phonotactic constraints that dictate what types of consonants are allowed to appear in certain positions inside a word. For instance, the sounds cannot occur before the vowel , and the latter two are restricted to the medial position. In a similar manner, the liquid is only observed in medial position and never before . As for the voiceless , it is the only rhotic segment that is allowed to appear in any position and before any vowel. The semivowel is found in initial, medial and final position, while does not occur in final position.. The glottal stop is automatic in words beginning or ending in a vowel, i.e. a word like \\"water\\" is pronounced as .. Vowels The Yawalapiti language has both oral and nasal vowels, as shown below. {   +Yawalapiti vowel phonemes. ! rowspan=2  ! colspan=2  Front ! colspan=2  Central ! colspan=2  Back - ! oral !! nasal ! oral !! nasal ! oral !! nasal - ! High       - ! Low       } Although nasal vowels mostly occur before or after nasal consonants, e.g. \\"pequi oil\\" or \\"termite\\", there are cases in which they are found in non-nasal environments, e.g. (emphatic particle).. Simple vowels can form various diphthongs, mainly .. Contrary to Waur√°, Yawalapiti has no sound. This is because Proto-Arawak *e has evolved as while, at the same time, Proto-Arawak *i and *…® have merged together resulting into in Yawalapiti.. Phonotactics Syllables in Yawalapiti can be of the type V, CV and, only in word-final position, (C)V î. The stress may fall on the penultimate or on the last syllable of a word. ==Morphology== Classifiers and derivational suffixes As other Arawakan languages, Yawalapiti is agglutinative and makes use of affixes, especially suffixes, to convey basic grammatical relations. Nominal suffixes can be divided into two groups: classifiers and derivational suffixes. The main classifiers found in Yawalapiti refer to the shape of an object or some other characteristic of it, like texture, length and position.. {  ! classifier !! semantics -  -ja  liquid -  -ti  elongated -  -ta  circular or spherical -  -ka  flat -  -pana  leaf-shaped -  -lu  wrapping } These morphemes attach to adjectives when they refer to a noun that needs a classifier, as in the following example. { style=\\"width:35%\\"  (1)  kulata-ja  u.     (2)  nat Éa  autsa-lu -   hot-CL.liquid  water      clothes  new-CL.wrapping -   colspan=2  Hot water.      colspan=2  New clothes. } Derivational suffixes are applied to primitive nouns to form new compound nouns. Sometimes, however, the meaning of the original noun is not known. { style=\\"width:30%\\"  (3)  ts…®m…®-rÃ•i     (4)  ina-pi -   tapir-DS.long      ?-DS.pointed -   boa constrictor      fish bone } Possessives Nominal and verbal prefixes intervene in the formation of possessive phrases, and can indicate the subject or the object of a verb phrase. The set of possessive prefixes of Yawalapiti is very similar to the those of the other languages of the Arawakan branch. {  style=\\"width:25%\\" +Possessive and personal prefixes. ! ! colspan=2  Before vowels - ! ! Singular ! Plural - ! 1st person  n-, ni-  a-, aw- - ! 2nd person  p-, pi-  i- - ! 3rd person  in-  in- ... -pa - ! ! colspan=2  Before consonants - ! ! Singular ! Plural - ! 1st person  nu-  a- - ! 2nd person  hi-, ti-  i- - ! 3rd person  i-  i- ... -pa } In vowel initial nouns and verbs, the forms ni- and pi- are frequently used with roots beginning in u, while the prefix aw- appears systematically before a. In nouns and verbs beginning in consonant, the form ti- occurs only when the root starts with h (in all the other cases, hi- is used). The third person plural is actually a circumfix formed by the correspondent prefix of the third person singular and the pluralizer suffix -pa. When nouns beginning with p, k, t, m, n, w and j are modified by the prefix of second person singular or plural, their initial sounds are subject to the following morphophonemic changes.. p ‚Üí …æ k ‚Üí t É t ‚Üí ts m ‚Üí …≤ n ‚Üí …≤ w ‚Üí √ò j ‚Üí √ò Thus, for example, -ku Éu \\"head\\" becomes hi-t Éu Éu \\"your head\\" (but nu- ku Éu \\"my head\\"), -palaka \\"face\\" becomes hi-…æalaka \\"your face\\" (but nu-palata \\"my face\\") and -jakanati \\"saliva\\" becomes hi-akanati \\"your saliva\\" (but nu- jakanati \\"my saliva\\"). Apart from possessive prefixes, alienable nouns also receive alienable possessive suffixes, as in the case of uku \\"arrow\\", which becomes n-uku-la \\"my arrow\\", p-uku-la \\"your arrow\\", in-uku-la \\"his/her arrow\\", etc. Independent pronouns Independent pronouns of first and second person are listed in the table below.. {  ! ! Singular ! Plural - ! 1st person  natu  a Çu - ! 2nd person  ti Çu  i Çu } For the third person, Yawalapiti speakers use demonstrative pronouns, which are also marked for gender. {  ! !! Masculine !! Feminine - ! Near  i…æi  i…æu - ! Far  iti…æa  i…æuti…æa } ==Syntax== From a typological point of view, the order of constituents in Yawalapiti is SVO. In genitive constructions, the possessor precedes the possessed item. The same is true for other modiefiers, especially demonstratives and numerals, while adjectives are free to occur before or after their referent.. ==NotesReferences== * * ==Further reading== *Carvalho, Fernando O. de. 2016.

Along with the Lithuanian National Symphony Orchestra, the ƒåiurlionis Quartet, early music ensemble Musica Humana and the Vilnius String Quartet, the LCO is a resident group of the National Philharmonic Hall. == About == The orchestra generally performs works of Lithuanian composers, and premiered works by the likes of Alfred Schnittke, Arvo P√§rt and Peters Vasks. It is also said to have a \\"special affinity for the works of Bach and Mozart.\\" Until 2004, the LCO was part of the Lithuanian National Philharmonic Society, but in that year, it gained independent status. Saulius Sondeckis served as Artistic Director and Chief Conductor from its inception in 1960 until 2004 and violinist Sergei Krylov was appointed in 2008. Yehudi Menuhin has conducted its choral-orchestral works. The LCO was the first Lithuanian orchestra to make its debut in the West at the Echternach Festival in Luxembourg in 1976. The orchestra has toured most European countries, the USA, Japan, Argentina, Cuba, Canada, Egypt, and South Africa. It has performed at prestigious venues such as the Musikverein in Vienna, Royal Festival in London, Santa Cecilia in Rome, Auditorium di Giuseppe Verdi in Milan, Concertgebouw in Amsterdam and many other famous concert halls and festivals in Europe. Joachim W. Hartnack in his book, Grosser Geiger unserer Zeit, has ranked the Lithuanian Chamber Orchestra as among \\"the three most masterly orchestras of the world\\". In 1976 the orchestra won the gold medal at the Herbert von Karajan Contest of Youth Orchestras in Berlin. ==References *Lithuanian Chamber Orchestra performance * Category:Lithuanian orchestras Category:Chamber orchestras Category:Musical groups established in 1960 Category:1960 establishments in Lithuania Category:Music in Vilnius ","title":"Lithuanian Chamber Orchestra"},{"id":"35249400","text":"The 1973‚Äì74 Football League season was Birmingham City Football Club's 71st in the Football League and their 40th in the First Division. After spending most of the season in the relegation positions, they finished in 19th place in the 22-team division, avoiding relegation by just one point. They entered the 1973‚Äì74 FA Cup at the third round proper and lost to Queens Park Rangers in the fourth, and were eliminated from the League Cup in the fifth round by Plymouth Argyle. They lost in the second round of the Texaco Cup on aggregate, after the first attempt to play the second leg of their match against Newcastle United had to be abandoned after 100 minutes when it became too dark to play. Thirty players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were twelve different goalscorers. Forward Bob Hatton played in 51 of the 54 first-team matches over the season, and the leading goalscorer was Hatton with 20 goals, of which 14 came in league competition. In February 1974, by which time he had already scored 18 goals for Birmingham, centre-forward Bob Latchford signed for Everton in part- exchange for Howard Kendall, Archie Styles, and ¬£80,000. The whole package was valued at a British record transfer fee of ¬£350,000. ==Football League First Division== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\"  - !scope=\\"col\\"Date!!scope=\\"col\\"League position!!scope=\\"col\\"Opponents !scope=\\"col\\"Venue!!scope=\\"col\\"Result!!scope=\\"col\\"Score F‚ÄìA!!scope=\\"col\\"Scorers !scope=\\"col\\"Attendance - !scope=\\"row\\"25 August 1973 15thalign=\\"left\\"Manchester CityA style=background:#fccL1‚Äì3align=\\"left\\"Hatton 35,881 - !scope=\\"row\\"28 August 1973 17thalign=\\"left\\"Tottenham HotspurH style=background:#fccL1‚Äì2align=\\"left\\"Hatton 37,754 - !scope=\\"row\\"1 September 1973 20thalign=\\"left\\"Derby CountyH style=background:#ffcD0‚Äì0 34,899 - !scope=\\"row\\"5 September 1973 22ndalign=\\"left\\"ChelseaA style=background:#fccL1‚Äì3align=\\"left\\"Page 25,660 - !scope=\\"row\\"8 September 1973 22ndalign=\\"left\\"Leeds UnitedA style=background:#fccL0‚Äì3 39,746 - !scope=\\"row\\"11 September 1973 22ndalign=\\"left\\"ChelseaH style=background:#fccL2‚Äì4align=\\"left\\"Hatton, Taylor 30,252 - !scope=\\"row\\"15 September 1973 22ndalign=\\"left\\"LiverpoolH style=background:#ffcD1‚Äì1align=\\"left\\"R.

She was the first woman Member of Parliament from the State of Karnataka, who represented the constituency Dharwad North for four terms between 1962 and 1980. In 1983 she was elected to the Rajya Sabha as member of the Janata Party. Mahishi is best known for heading the committee appointed by the government of Karnataka in 1983 to recommend criteria for reservation in employment in the State. Submitting the recommendations in 1986, the committee recommended that a major percentage of employment in Karnataka should be reserved to the local people. == Early life == Sarojini Mahishi was born to Kamalabai and Bindurao Mahishi on 3 March 1927 in Dharwad, a city in the erstwhile Bombay Presidency of British India (in present-day Karnataka). She was the second of eight children. Her father Bindurao was a leading advocate and Sanskrit scholar. Sarojini was schooled in the government-run schools of Dharwad before she attended Willingdon College in Sangli. She received a degree in law from the Raja Lakhamgouda Law College in Belgaum, and a master's degree in Sanskrit language. == Career == Mahishi began her career as a teacher and taught Sanskrit and law for a few years at Janata Shikshana Samiti College in Dharwad before joining the State Social Welfare Board. Mahishi died on 25 January 2015 at her residence in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. Her remains were cremated in a crematorium in Lodhi Road, Delhi, and her last rites were performed by her brother P. B. Mahishi. Literary activities Mahishi translated a number of Kannada and Marathi works into Hindi. Most prominent among them is the translation of Manku Thimmana Kagga of Kannada Poet D. V. Gundappa.

Pro Kannada lobby groups such as Karnataka Rakshana Vedike have been pressurising the implementation of Dr. Sarojini Mahishi Report in Karnataka The Hindu Business Line: Pro-Kannada activists demand more jobs for locals in IT sector The committee headed by Mahishi included four retired officers of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). The members were poet Gopalakrishna Adiga, G. K. Satya, K. Prabhakara Reddy, G. Narayana Kumar, a legislator, and retired IAS officers B. S. Hanuman and Siddayya Puranik. Salient features of the Report The committee was constituted in 1983, submitted interim report on 13.6.1984 and final report on 30.12.1986 and it made 58 recommendations. Of these recommendations, Government of Karnataka accepted 45 recommendations for implementation. Some of the recommendations are: 100 per cent reservation for Kannadigas in all State Government establishments and Public Sector units. 100 percent reservation for Kannadigas in group 'c' and group 'd' jobs in Central Government departments and PSUs operating in Karnataka. A Minimum of 80 percent and 65 reservation for Kannadigas for Group 'b' and Group 'a' jobs respectively, in Central Government units and PSUs operating in Karnataka. All Personnel officers in all industrial units in the state should invariably be a Kannadiga. Industries should appoint local people on priority. Consequences The Sarojini Mahishi report has become a tool for local organisations to insist all jobs in Karnataka to locals and implementation of local language in the state. Government of Karnataka has established a separate department named \\"Kannada Abhivridhi Pradhikara\\" to oversee that the accepted recommendations of the report are implemented in Karnataka effectively. ==List of works== * Sakuntala (1952) * Kasuti Kale (1953) ==Awards== *Hindi Ratna Samman *Honorary D Litt at the 58th annual convocation of Karnataka University ==References External links == * Sarojini Mahishi bioprofile Category:Rajya Sabha members from Karnataka Category:20th-century Indian translators Category:1927 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Union deputy ministers of India Category:Lok Sabha members from Karnataka Category:People from Dharwad district Category:5th Lok Sabha members Category:Indian National Congress politicians from Karnataka Category:Janata Party politicians Category:Indian women translators Category:Women in Karnataka politics Category:20th-century Indian women politicians Category:20th-century Indian politicians Category:Women union ministers of state of India Category:3rd Lok Sabha members Category:4th Lok Sabha members Category:6th Lok Sabha members ","title":"Sarojini Mahishi"},{"id":"35249436","text":"Akbar Ahmad (born 30 June 1948) is an Indian politician and was member of the 12th Lok Sabha (1998‚Äì99) from Azamgarh Constituency in Uttar Pradesh state in India. == Life and career == Akbar Ahmad completed his schooling from The Doon School and later went to Canning College.

The film, released in October 2012, focuses on Cao Cao's life in his later years and depicts two assassination attempts on the warlord. The supporting cast includes Liu Yifei, Hiroshi Tamaki, Alec Su, Annie Yi, Qiu Xinzhi, Yao Lu and Ni Dahong. The film's Chinese title is a reference to the Bronze Sparrow Platform (ÈìúÈõÄÂè∞), a terrace constructed in 210 by Cao Cao in the ancient city of Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei). ==Plot== The film is set in China in the late 210s ‚Äì the years preceding the end of the Han dynasty. Over a period of two decades, Cao Cao had defeated L√º Bu and other rival warlords to gain supremacy in northern and central China. In 216, he is granted the title of a vassal king, the \\"King of Wei\\", by Emperor Xian, the figurehead Han ruler controlled by him. He constructs the Bronze Sparrow Platform as a showcase of his power. Lingju is the orphaned daughter of L√º Bu and Diaochan. She, like many other orphaned children of Cao Cao's enemies, was recruited in her childhood by Cao Cao's rivals to be trained as assassins to kill Cao. She meets Mu Shun, who protects her while she is in training and falls in love with him. Mu Shun is castrated and Lingju and Mu Shun eventually find their way into court life: Lingju is taken by Cao Cao as one of his mistresses while Mu Shun becomes a palace eunuch. There are two major attempts on Cao Cao's life. The first is masterminded by Empress Fu Shou and her father Fu Wan. This plan fails and Cao Cao has the conspirators ‚Äì including the empress ‚Äì executed in front of Emperor Xian. The second is a revolt led by the imperial physician Ji Ben and his supporters, but the rebellion is swiftly crushed. Cao Cao suspects that his son, Cao Pi, is involved in the assassination plots. Mu Shun fails in his attempt to kill Cao Cao, who reveals that he knew all along that Lingju is planning to assassinate him. Cao Cao promises to spare Lingju's life. In return, Mu Shun disguises himself as Cao Cao and rides out of the city, only to be mortally wounded by Lingju, who mistakes him for Cao and stabs him with her father's weapon. Lingju then commits suicide to join Mu Shun. ==Cast== * Chow Yun-fat as Cao Cao * Liu Yifei as Lingju / Diaochan ** Zhang Zimu as Lingju (young) * Hiroshi Tamaki as Mu Shun ** Liu Jieyi as Mu Shun (young) * Alec Su as Emperor Xian of Han * Annie Yi as Empress Fu Shou * Qiu Xinzhi as Cao Pi * Yao Lu as Ji Ben * Ni Dahong as Fu Wan * Chi Cheng as Xu Chu * Qu Quancheng as Cao Zhi * Bao Jianfeng as L√º Bu * Peng Jingci as Cao Xiu * Guo Jinfei as Chen Meng * Tian Ruihui as Mu Yan ==Reception== The film premiered at the 11th Changchun Film Festival and impressed audiences with its accuracy and attention to historical details, both in terms of story and costumes. ==See also== * List of media adaptations of Romance of the Three Kingdoms ==References* * The Assassins on Sina.com Category:2012 films Category:Chinese films Category:Mandarin-language films Category:Films set in 3rd-century Han dynasty Category:Films based on Romance of the Three Kingdoms Category:Chinese historical films ","title":"The Assassins (film)"},{"id":"35249457","text":"==Peerage of England== Earl of Surrey (1088)John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey12401304 - Earl of Warwick (1088)William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick12671298 - Earl of Gloucester (1122)Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester126212956th Earl of Hertford - rowspan=\\"2\\"Earl of Arundel (1138)John FitzAlan, 7th Earl of Arundel12671272Died - Richard FitzAlan, 8th Earl of Arundel12721302 - rowspan=\\"2\\"Earl of Norfolk (1140)Roger Bigod, 4th Earl of Norfolk12251270Died - Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk12701306 - Earl of Devon (1141)Isabella de Fortibus, Countess of Devon12621293 - Earl of Oxford (1142)Robert de Vere, 5th Earl of Oxford12631297 - Earl of Salisbury (1145)Margaret de Lacy, 4th Countess of Salisbury12611310 - rowspan=\\"2\\"Earl of Hereford (1199)Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford122012751st Earl of Essex (1239) - Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford127512982nd Earl of Essex - Earl of Lincoln (1217)Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln12661311 - rowspan=\\"2\\"Earl of Cornwall (1225)Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall12251272Died - Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall12721300 - Earl of Pembroke (1247)William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke12471296 - Earl of Chester (1253)Edward, Earl of Chester12531272Succeeded as King of England, and the title merged in the Crown - Earl of Leicester (1265)Edmund Plantagenet, 1st Earl of Leicester126712961st Earl of Lancaster - Earl of Richmond (1268)John II, Duke of Brittany12681305 - Baron de Ros (1264)(Robert de Ros)12641285 - Baron le Despencer (1264)Hugh le Despencer, 2nd Baron le Despencer12651326 - Baron Basset of Drayton (1264)Ralph Basset, 2nd Baron Basset of Drayton12651299 - Baron Basset of Sapcote (1264)Ralph Basset, 1st Baron Basset of Sapcote12641282 ==Peerage of Scotland== Earl of Mar (1114)Uilleam, Earl of MarAbt. 12401281 - Earl of Dunbar (1115)Patrick III, Earl of Dunbar12481289 - Earl of Angus (1115)Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus12461307 - rowspan=2Earl of Atholl (1115)David I Strathbogie, Earl of Atholl12641270Died - John of Strathbogie, Earl of Atholl12701306 - Earl of Buchan (1115)Alexander Comyn, Earl of BuchanAbt. 12431289 - rowspan=2Earl of Strathearn (1115)Maol √çosa II, Earl of Strathearn12451271Died - Maol √çosa III, Earl of Strathearn12711317 - rowspan=2Earl of Fife (1129)Colb√°n, Earl of Fife12661270Died - Donnchadh III, Earl of Fife12701288 - Earl of Menteith (1160)Mary I, Countess of Menteith12581295 - Earl of Lennox (1184)Maol Choluim I, Earl of Lennox12601291 - Earl of Carrick (1184)Marjorie, Countess of Carrick12561292 - rowspan=2Earl of Ross (1215)Uilleam I, Earl of Ross12511274Died - Uilleam II, Earl of Ross12741333 - Earl of Sutherland (1235)William de Moravia, 2nd Earl of Sutherland12481307 - } ==Peerage of Ireland== rowspan=2Earl of Ulster (1264)Walter de Burgh, 1st Earl of Ulster12641271Died - Richard √ìg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster12711326 - Baron Athenry (1172)Peter de Bermingham12621307 - Baron Kingsale (1223)Nicholas de Courcy, 3rd Baron Kingsale12601290 - Baron Kerry (1223)Maurice Fitzthomas Fitzmaurice, 2nd Baron Kerry12601303 - rowspan=2Baron Barry (1261)David de Barry, 1st Baron Barry12611278Died - John Barry, 2nd Baron Barry12781285 - } ==References== * * Category:Lists of peers by decade Category:1270s in England Category:1270s in Ireland Category:13th century in Scotland Category:13th-century English people Category:13th-century Irish people Category:13th-century mormaers Peers ","title":"List of peers 1270‚Äì1279"},{"id":"35249462","text":"Louise Harris is an Australian actress from Davoren Park, South Australia.

It started on the second day of the Soviet invasion of Poland in an attempt to assist the external attack. ==BackgroundThe events== The revolt of 18 September 1939 was organized by the Communist Party of West Belarus which was outlawed by Poland in 1938. According to Russian documents, it consisted of around 200 men, although their number has been contested by Polish historian Marek Wierzbicki as exaggerated. A group of Jews and Belarusians, members and sympathizers of the delegalized Communist Party, all citizens of Poland, took control of the town of Skidel and some nearby locations, acquired firearms, often from skirmishes with Polish Army units and police Similar incidents of various severity, with pro- communist activists attacking and taking over local government offices, arresting or fighting with Polish police and army personnel, took place in numerous nearby settlements including , Wiercieliszki, Wielka Brzostowica, Dubno, Wo≈Çpa, Indura (near Grodno), Sopoƒákinie, Zelwa, Wo≈Çkowysk, Ostryna, Zdziƒôcio≈Ç (near Nowogr√≥dek), Jan√≥w Poleski, Horodec, Antopol, Drohiczyn Poleski and Motol nearby among other locations. In a number of instances, individual or groups of former authority figures, such as civil servants, landowners, priests, rural settlers, policemen and reserve officers, usually of Polish ethnicity, were murdered, including in Skidel, Brzostowica Ma≈Ça, Lerypol, Budowla, and other locations. Wierzbicki estimates that there were dozens if not hundreds of such incidents. Several Polish families were rescued by their Belarusian neighbors in the village of Sawal√≥wka. In some settlements, the withdrawal of Polish administration ahead of the Soviet advance prompted Jewish councils to form self-defense groups against the Belarusian raids which further complicated the issue of allegiance. Some of the self-defending Jews were driven by deep-seated Polish patriotism. Polish Army units quickly engaged the insurgents, On 19 September 1939 the 102nd Uhlan Regiment of the Polish Army engaged some insurgents around Ostryna, Dubno and Jeziory. After some skirmishes, Polish units put down the revolt and took control of Skidel and neighboring settlements. The insurgents captured with weapons were summarily executed. Shortly afterward, on 20 September, advancing Red Army units, supported by armor, took over Skidel, pushing the Polish forces back. ==Aftermath== When Soviet forces took over Skidel, many Poles were immediately arrested. Some time later in 1940 there was a show trial in Skidel of 15 individuals including three women, two Tartars and two Polish Russians, who aided the Polish Army which briefly retook Skidel on 19 September. They were accused of crimes against the Soviet Union. There is no historical record of what happened to them, although Wierzbicki states that fragmentary information and \\"common practice\\" suggests that at least some of them were executed. After the end of World War II, and the annexation of eastern Poland, the mass murders and robberies were hushed up and the sabotage action in Skidzyel‚Äô turned by the Soviet Union into a province-wide liberation movement. In 1940 the Soviet authorities found clear evidence of the widespread robberies and mass murders committed on the side by scores of intoxicated peasants and criminal opportunists, but after the intervention of the communist party representative, the Soviet court threw out the case citing political rationale (justified class struggle), as well as procedural reasons (that it has no jurisdiction to persecute crimes that happened on those territories before the Soviet annexation of them on, that legal documents dated to 2 November 1939). After the annexation of eastern Poland, the Soviet propaganda turned the Skidzyel‚Äô events into a liberation movement, and mythologized them. ==See also== * War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II == References  External links == * Category:Soviet invasion of Poland Category:1939 in Poland Category:1939 in Belarus Category:Belarus in World War II Category:Western Belorussia (1918‚Äì1939) ","title":"Skidel revolt"},{"id":"35249489","text":"Francesco Camaldo (born 24 October 1952) is an Italian priest of the Catholic Church, and is currently the assistant of Circolo San Pietro. ==Birth== Camaldo was born on 24 October 1952 at Lagonegro, Italy. ==Seminarian and priest== After high school, Camaldo was a student in the Roman Seminary and later was ordained priest on 26 June 1976 by Cardinal Vicar Ugo Poletti, Francesco Camaldo also was vicar of the parish of St. Mary of Consolation, Casalbertone in Rome (1976-1990) ==Studies== Bachelor of Philosophy and Theology at the Pontifical Lateran University, Bachelor of Spiritual Theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University, Bachelor and Doctor in Sacred Liturgy at the Pontifical Liturgical Institute of San Anselmo. ==Jobs in The Roman Curia== The charges that were assigned as follows: * Chaplain of the Chapel of St. Andrew Corsini for the Honorable Papal Basilica of St. John Lateran (17 January 1988) * Assistant studies in the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (1 January 1993) * Officer of the Vicariate of Rome (1984-1993) * Private Secretary to Cardinal Ugo Poletti, from 1984 to 1997 when he died. * Club Chaplain of St. Peter (22 February 2005) * Rector of the Chapel of St. Mary of Mercy in the Coliseum (October 10, 2005) Cardinal Camillo Ruini, Vicar General of His Holiness for the city of Rome, appointed Bishop Camaldo: * Club Chaplain of St. Peter (22 February 2005) * Dean of the Chapel of St. Mary of Mercy in the Coliseum (October 10, 2005) Dean of Pontifical Ceremonies Francesco was also Camaldo Prelate of Honor of His Holiness, Pope and Master of Ceremonies (27 June 1984).

Its habitat is from open maquis, to mountain area as low scrub, on a substrate of eroded ultramafic rocks. ==Characteristics== The plants are shrubs, rarely exceeding 1.50 m in height, with thick branches, scattered and few. They have pseudo- whorled leaves (5-10 x 0, 20-0, 60 cm), more or less toothed or lobed at the apex, cuneate at the base, leathery, venation slightly prominent, petiole short and robust. Flowers are small, white or pinkish in terminal panicles from 20 to 50 cm. The fruits are small and hairy, containing a single seed. ==Ecology== The soils of ultramafic rocks, which are mining terrains, have been a refuge for many native plant species of New Caledonia because they are toxic and their mineral content is poorly suited to most foreign species of plants.Dossier > La flore de Nouvelle-Cal√©donie - Premi√®re partie On New Caledonia examples of such soils commonly have an excess of magnesium, plus unusually high concentrations of phytotoxic compounds of heavy metals such as nickel.

The language is endangered and the number of speakers with fluency is decreasing year by year, as most teenagers do not speak the language, instead speaking the Sichuan dialect of Chinese. == Geographical distribution == Namuyi is a language spoken in the following 4 villages of southern Sichuan: *' (Namuyi name): D√†shu«ê Village Â§ßÊ∞¥Êùë, M√≠nsh√®ng Township Ê∞ëËÉúÈÑâ, Xƒ´chƒÅng City (80 ethnic Namuyi) *' (Namuyi name): –•i«éngshu«ê Village ÈüøÊ∞¥Êùë, Xi«éngshu«ê –¢–æwnship ÈüøÊ∞¥ÈÑâ, Xƒ´chƒÅng City (800 ethnic Namuyi) *' (Namuyi name): D≈çngfƒìng Village Êù±È¢®Êùë, Z√©yu«én, Township Êæ§ÈÅ†ÈÑâ, Mi«énn√≠ng County (560 ethnic Namuyi) *' (Namuyi name): L«éoyƒÅ Village ËÄÅÈ¥âÊùë, ShƒÅb√† Town, Ê≤ôÂ£©ÈéÆ, Mi«énn√≠ng County (290 ethnic Namuyi) It is also spoken in Muli and Yanyuan of the Liangshan Autonomous Prefecture and Jiulong County in the Ganzi Autonomous Prefecture. == Dialects == The Namuyi language is subdivided into two different dialects, the dialect of spoken by the people around Muli, and the dialect of those spoken in Mianning. The dialects differ mainly in phonology, where the Mianning and Yanyuan dialect have few consonant clusters as opposed to the Mianning and Xichang dialect. == Phonology == There are 40 single- consonant initials in the Namuyi language. Namuyi also has ten phonemic vowels, /i/ for [i], /e/ for [e], /…õ/ for […õ], /…®/ for [ É,…Ø] / â/ for [y], /…ô/ for […ô], /a/ for [a], /u/ for [u], /o/ for [o], and /…î/ for […î].

There are differences in the phonology of the dialects, but communication is possible. Two or three varieties have low mutual intelligibility with the rest. It may be the same language as S√∂tati-p√∂ in early editions of Ethnologue.Klose (2001) Sprachen der Welt Sun (1991) documents Guiqiong of Maiben Township È∫¶Êú¨‰π°, Yutong District È±ºÈÄöÂå∫, Kangding County Â∫∑ÂÆöÂéø, Sichuan (Sun 1991:227). The Qiangic languages are split into two language clusters. Guiqiong is categorized into a specific Qiangic cluster based on its vocabulary. This Qiangic language cluster also includes Zhaba, Queya, Ersu, Shixing, and Namuzi.Thurgood, G., & LaPolla, R. J. (Eds.). (2006). The Sino-Tibetan Languages (p. 17). London, United Kingdom: Taylor and Francis elibrary. Outside their villages, speakers communicate utilizing the Chinese language. Guiqiong is heavily influenced by the Chinese language, as it contains many loanwords.Hongkai, S. (1990). Linguistics of the Tibeto- Burman Area (Vols. 13 - 1, pp. 11). (J. T, Trans.). The Guiqiong language utilizes four tones and has no written script.Guiqiong Profile. (n.d.). In Sichuan's Ethnic Corridor. Retrieved March 9, 2017.

Tonawanda, NY: Multilingual Matters Ltd. ==General Information== Population of Speakers The population of speakers of this language for a long time have only been estimates. It has been difficult to provide an accurate count of how many exist because since the People's Republic of China was founded, the government has considered the Guiqiong people to be a part of the Tibetan minority. Because of this, the national census cannot provide an official count of the Guiqiong people. Location The general location of Guiqiong speakers is confined to a very small rectangular area. This area stretches 20 kilometers from its northern boundary to the southern boundary, and just reaches about 1 kilometer from its eastern to its western boundary. The area is situated to the west of the well-known Sichuan Province in China. Jiang (2015: 2) reports that Guiqiong is spoken in the townships of Maibeng, Shelian, Qianxi, Guzan, Lan'an, and Pengba. Jiang's (2015) data is mostly from Guzan Township. Most groups who speak languages that are part of the Qiangic subgroup of Tibeto-Burman are classified as members of the Tibetan national minority and live in western Sichuan province.Turin, M., & Zeisler, B.

It happened after February 2012 clashes in Kufra, that involved the Tubu people, too. On 27 March, Jomode Elie Getty charged the clashes as \\"genocide\\". A Paris-based Tabu official, Jomode Elie Getty, who was an official with the NTC but resigned on Tuesday, accused the NTC of siding with Arabs in attacks on Tabu tribesmen. He called for U.N. intervention. Issa Abdel Majit Monsur, the head of the Tubu tribe in Libya, announced the reactivation of the \\"Toubou Front for the Salvation of Libya\\", an opposition group that was already active during the rule of Muammar Gaddafi. He also announced the possibility of separatist activities. A ceasefire was announced, and as of 1 April the violence had stopped. == Events == Late on 25 March, clashes erupted in the southern city of Sabha, between Libyan government militia in the city and Tubu tribesman, after a man from the Abu Seif tribe was killed in a dispute over a car by the Tubu. The fighting was, at first, mainly on the city outskirts. However, it then spread to the city's main streets and black plumes of smoke could be seen rising from Sabha's airport on 26 March. Initially seven people were reportedly killed and another seven wounded. However, later reports put the death toll at 20 with another 40 people wounded. The Tubu stated that the Abu Seif attacked their negotiation team outside a government building while they were en route to talk about reconciliation. On 27 March, the fighting in Sabha continued and the toll was reported to had reached 49 dead, with 15 of the killed being from the Tubu and the rest from Abu Seif. Tubu militiamen had reportedly advanced into the center of the city and their snipers had taken up positions, inflicting a number of casualties. On 28 March, the fighting briefly eased off with reports of a ceasefire, but quickly escalated again. By the end of the day the toll had reached more than 70 dead and 150 wounded, 40 of the dead being from the Tubu. On 30 March, ceasefire was negotiated between the Council of Elders of Libya, Sabha local council and members of the Misrata militia in the southern city. According to it, Tubu tribesmen are to withdraw from all areas and recognize the authority of the national army which would take control of all security operations in the south and on the borders. In return, the Tubu will be returned all property in Libya and there will be an investigation into the conflict. Moreover, local militias would be integrated into either Army or Ministry of Interior forces. However, the fighting re- ignited the next day once again. On 31 March, the Tubus, after being pushed back south of the city, launched a counter-attack in a bid to re-enter the town. 16 people were killed, eight from each side, and more than 50 wounded. The Libyan health minister announced that 147 people had been killed and 395 wounded, up to the night before, since the start of the fighting in Sabha. Later that day, colonel Wanis Bu Khamadh, commander in charge of army units inside the city, said that despite the clashes, the army was able to extend its area of control throughout most of the city and area south of the Sabha. He also claimed that situation de-escalated and army was making a push in order to take under its direct control the whole Fezzan region. On 2 April, Libyan Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib has visited area and confirmed that fragile peace was so far holding. Meanwhile, National Transitional Council president Mustafa Abdul Jalil declared southern region encompassing cities Wadi al Shatii, Sabha, Ubari, Ghat, and Murzuq military zone where military commander, under which authority falls all armed forces in the region, was appointed by Ministry of Defence instead of regional military councils. The National Liberation Army and Ministry of Interior forces dispatched 2,000 soldiers and border guards to region with Free Libyan Air Force patrolling over the area. Meanwhile, the National Liberation Army was able to secure all areas of Sabha. El-Keib said \\"every Libyan is important to us. We're going to take care of them like we do take care of any other Libyan, like our brothers and sisters.\\" Despite the deployment of 2,000 soldiers under the command of Wanis Bukhamada in March, violence has continued, with Bukhamada's home in Benghazi even coming under attack in early September. On 14 September further clashes between the Tebu and a local Arab tribe left 2 head, and on 17 September there was an attempted assassination against Col. Ali Dallah Gaidi, the Head of Sebha Military Council. Gaidi's wife was killed in the attack. == References == Sabha Category:2012 in Libya Category:History of Fezzan Category:Aftermath of the Libyan Civil War (2011) ","title":"2012 Sabha conflict"},{"id":"35249762","text":"John Freame (1669‚Äì1745) was an English banker.

In 1683, he was apprenticed to Job Bolton, a Quaker goldsmith based in Lombard Street. ==Career== Upon completion of his apprenticeship, he gained his Freedom of the City on 7 April 1690, giving him the right to open a business within the City. Freame went into partnership with Thomas Gould, a fellow Quaker. Located in a part of the city where 25% of the population were Quakers they were able to build up their reputation ‚Äî and their business, particularly amongst Quakers.

Barclays: The Business of Banking, 1690-1996 Cambridge University Press 2001 Signs were used to identify buildings in an age when few people could read, and, as buildings changed hands, signs would remain. Barclays, who continued to trade from the site in Lombard Street, became identified with the Spread Eagle which was then adopted as the official coat of arms for the Bank in 1937. The Barclay name entered the business in 1736, when James Barclay, who had married one of John Freame's daughters, was taken into the partnership by his brother-in-law, Joseph.

The bridge is about 806 feet long, 247 feet high and cost Rs21.6 million. Ayub Bridge, can be truly declared as one of the prides of Sukkur. It has served the city for 50 years by providing a strong link for rail traffic between Sukkur and Rohri. Before this, Lansdowne Bridge was the railway link between Sukkur and Rohri. The foundation stone of this steel arch bridge was laid on 9 December 1960 and inaugurated by President Muhammad Ayub Khan on 6 May 1962. The consulting engineer was David B. Steinman. The Ayub Bridge became the world's third longest railway arch span and the first railway bridge in the world to be slung on coiled wire rope suspenders. ==History== Before the bridges, the transport between Sukkur and Rohri was by boats and steamers. Boatman Mir Mohammad alias Miroo recalled how his father Yar Mohammad used to run a small service between Sukkur and Rohri till the early sixties. ‚ÄúVery few people had cars or motorcycles at that time and therefore motor boats were the only way of communication.‚Äù Some people used to cross the River Indus by Lansdowne Bridge on bicycle. The train used to run in the center of the bridge and pedestrians and cyclists used the wooden walkways at both sides. The fare for a single adult passenger was one anna (0.06 PKR) back in the day. They charged half for a child. Construction of Ayub Bridge started on November 26, 1959 and its foundation stone was laid on December 9, 1960 by the then minister of railways and communication, Khan FM Khan, Khan of Shewa. The contractor of the bridge was M/S Dorman Long Gammon of London, famous for Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932. The consulting engineer was DB Steinman of New York ‚Äì the man who reconstructed the famous Brooklyn Bridge in New York. Field Marshal Mohammad Ayub Khan inaugurated the bridge on the Sunday 6 May 1962. ==Construction work== The rationale behind construction of this arc bridge over the Indus is rocks in the river bed which do not allow the pillars to withstand the constant flow and pressure of water for a long time. The construction phase of Ayub Bridge was interesting as first of all four huge cemented abutments, two on each side of the river banks, were made. These abutments have to bear weight of the arc. In arc bridges, construction work has to start simultaneously from both sides of the river. Therefore, two half arches supporting the deck with cables were built which were joined as one, to the amusement of the people witnessing the activity. The engineer would climb up the arcs through a ladder every day to physically check the strength of hundreds of rivets used in the bridge. Rivet is a metal pin used for fastening two pieces of metal together. It was a frightening sight not only for us but also for others watching, with the mighty Indus flowing beneath. Ayub Bridge is a living example of a magnificent structure built with the joint efforts of engineers of Dorman Long and Company and the Pakistan Railways. It also reflects the passion and sincerity of the people at the helm of affairs of Railways at that time to bring about tangible improvements in the country's transportation systems. When the great steel Ayub arch was constructed (1960‚Äì1962), railway traffic was shifted from Lansdowne Bridge to it. About a hundred feet apart, the two bridges seem like one from a distance. The Ayub arch became the world's third longest railway arch span and the first bridge in the world to have \\"the railway desk slung on coiled wire rope suspenders.\\" ==See also== * Sukkur District * Lansdowne Bridge Rohri * Sukkur Barrage * Sukkur ==References== Category:Bridges in Sindh Category:Buildings and structures in Sindh Category:Bridges over the Indus River Category:Railway bridges in Pakistan Category:Sukkur ","title":"Ayub Bridge"},{"id":"35249911","text":"Lamontville is a town in EThekwini in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa.
