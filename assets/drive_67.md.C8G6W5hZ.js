It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 12, 2003. In the episode, Homer disappoints Lisa on her birthday when he gives her a thoughtless present. He realizes that he knows little about her and decides to hire private detective Dexter Colt to spy on her. Colt compiles a report about Lisa that helps Homer bond with his daughter. However, Colt soon demands to be paid $1000, which Homer refuses. In retaliation, Colt vandalizes an animal research lab and steals all the animals, leaving behind several clues that implicate Lisa. Homer and Lisa go on the run as fugitives and end up at a circus, where they meet Colt. He tries to kill Homer, but Lisa saves him and Colt is arrested. ==Plot== To keep her secrets confidential, Lisa wants a Turbo Diary, which electrocutes anyone who tries to read it besides the owner, for her birthday after seeing a commercial of it on TV. Homer and Bart go to the mall to get the diary, but the former gets sidetracked by the loads of free food samples and by the time they get to the toy store, the diaries are sold out. After seeing a personalized animated film Ned made for Rod, Homer does the same for Lisa, but when Lisa watches it, she realizes Homer knows nothing about her, upsetting her. Feeling sad, Homer gets an idea from Moe to hire Dexter Colt, a private detective, to find out facts about Lisa. Colt spies on her and builds up information for a report, which Homer uses to bond with Lisa by playing songs she likes and going to a protest against animal testing at a research lab. When Homer goes to Colt to thank him, he gives him a bill for $1000. Homer refuses to pay the bill and runs off to his house as Colt swears revenge. The next morning, someone has vandalized the research lab and stolen all the animals. Chief Wiggum says that, based on the clues, Lisa is the main suspect. Lisa says she is innocent and Homer realizes that she has been framed by Colt. They escape as fugitives in disguise. While on the run, Homer confesses about the report and Colt to Lisa, upsetting her once more. The police track the pair to a motel, but they escape again and find themselves at a circus, where they find all the stolen animals. Colt shows up and chases Homer into a hall of mirrors. As Colt is about to kill Homer, Lisa shows up. After Homer mentions her strong sense of hearing, Lisa, impressed he actually remembered something about her, blinds Colt with a laser pointer Bart gave her for her birthday, resulting in him being arrested. Lisa is exonerated, and the animals are all released back into the wild, until Cletus and his family adopts them. Later, Lisa eventually gets her Turbo Diary, which Bart uses one night to play a prank on Homer. ==Production== Elliott Gould guest starred in the episode as himself, appearing in a parody of MTV Cribs. \\"The Dad Who Knew Too Little\\" was written by Matt Selman and directed by Mark Kirkland as part of the fourteenth season of The Simpsons (2002‚Äì03).Selman, Matt (2011). Audio commentary for \\"The Dad Who Knew Too Little\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. American actor Elliott Gould guest starred in the episode as himself, appearing in the television show Padz that Bart and Lisa watch at the beginning of the episode. Padz, which is a parody of the reality show MTV Cribs, takes its viewers inside the luxurious homes of celebrities. The celebrity featured in the episode that Bart and Lisa watch is Krusty the Clown, and he is seen having a fight with his neighbor, Gould, whose son has been bitten by Krusty's tame chimp.Jean, Al (2011). Audio commentary for \\"The Dad Who Knew Too Little\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Gould had been referenced in a previous episode of The Simpsons, in which it was revealed that he was Marge's hero when she was in high school. According to The Simpsons showrunner Al Jean, Gould wrote a letter to the producers of the show thanking them for the reference. This prompted them to ask him if he wanted to do a guest appearance in the series. When Gould assaults Krusty, he names his fists and feet Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice, a reference to the film of the same name that Gould starred in. The Simpsons cast member Hank Azaria provided the voice of Dexter Colt, basing it on actor Robert Stack who has played several detectives and agents. Kirkland was enthusiastic about directing the episode as he enjoys film noir detective films and is a big fan of actor Humphrey Bogart, who has appeared in many films of the genre. Kirkland based the design of Colt on Robert Mitchum, who, in addition to being a film noir actor, played a detective in the 1991 film Cape Fear, while playing the villain in the original film.Kirkland, Mark (2011). Audio commentary for \\"The Dad Who Knew Too Little\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. A viewing of detective films from the film noir period was arranged by Kirkland for his animation crew so that they would get inspiration on how to animate the scenes featuring Colt, including how to design the environments and how to make Colt act. ==Release== The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 12, 2003. It was viewed in approximately 7.6 million households that night. With a Nielsen rating of 7.1, the episode finished 39th in the ratings for the week of January 6‚Äì12, 2003 (tied with new episodes of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and 48 Hours). It was the third highest-rated broadcast on Fox that week, following a National Football League playoffs game and an episode of Joe Millionaire. On December 6, 2011, \\"The Dad Who Knew Too Little\\" was released on Blu-ray and DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Fourteenth Season. Staff members Jean, Selman, Kirkland, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Carolyn Omine, Matt Warburton, and David Silverman, as well as cast member Yeardley Smith and former Simpsons guest star \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic, participated in the audio commentary for the episode. In February 2004, \\"The Dad Who Knew Too Little\\" won a Writers Guild of America Award in the \\"Animation\\" category for its script. Other nominations in that category included the Simpsons episodes \\"Moe Baby Blues\\" and \\"My Mother the Carjacker\\", both from 2003, and episodes of Futurama, King of the Hill, and The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius. \\"The Dad Who Knew Too Little\\" received a negative review from critic Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide. He wrote: \\"How many times will the series go to the 'Homer neglects Lisa and gets in trouble' well? Many, and the result is usually the same: mediocrity and sentimentality. 'Little' proves to be no less predictable than its brethren, though the private detective angle adds some mirth. Still, it‚Äôs an unexceptional episode that feels like one we‚Äôve already seen many times.\\" ===Homer's email=== Writer Matt Selman registered Homer's email that is seen in the episode and responded to mails sent by fans. Homer gives his email, chunkylover53@aol.com, to Dexter Colt in the episode so that they can keep contact. In an article for the technology section of the Time website, Selman wrote that he registered that email before the broadcast of the episode, thinking that \\"if anyone wanted to write an email to Homer, it would be fun to answer back.\\" Once the episode had aired, he logged in to find that his inbox had reached its maximum 999-message limit. According to Selman, most messages \\"were of the simple, 'Who is this?' or 'Are U Matt Groening?' or 'LOL Homer Rulzzz LOL!' variety. But many people wrote long, thoughtful, attempting-to-be funny missives to Homer\\". Selman responded to many of the messages in the character of Homer. He initially intended to answer them all, but gave up when he received even more messages after deleting some of the answered ones in his inbox. At first, Selman answered the messages individually, trying to come up with clever responses for each one. He then ran out of ideas and his answers started getting less clever, and eventually he would just copy a few responses and use them on all the messages. These responses were, according to Selman, written along the lines of \\"Dear Nerd, I didn‚Äôt even know the internet was on computers these days, let alone some kind of electric mail dealie. Please send all future letters (and beer) to: 742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield USA then a zip code. Praise Jebus! ‚ÄîHomer Simpson.\\" Selman would also occasionally just reply with a simple \\"d'oh!\\". In 2008, Homer's email name \\"Chunkylover53\\" drew media attention after it had been used by hackers. Users of AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) who had added an account with the screen name Chunkylover53 to their contact list could see that the account had changed its status message to include a link and the text \\"click that and click RUN (or RUN from current location) or save to desktop and double click, it's a *new* internet-only exclusive Simpson's episode that is only being released to the internet fans! Enjoy!\\" The link led to an executable file (.exe) that installed a Trojan on the computers that ran the file. Rootkit software was installed on the infected computers, which were also deposited into a Turkish botnet, according to Christopher Boyd of Actiance's SpywareGuide. Selman has stated that he was not involved with the spreading of the malware, and Boyd wrote that \\"the AIM screen-name 'Chunkylover53' is not necessarily connected to the 'official' chunkylover53@aol.com email address ‚Äì anyone could have set up that AIM screen-name, using whatever EMail address they feel like. However, people will naturally add 'Chunkylover53' to their AIM accounts thinking it will be the 'real' Homer.\\" ==Cultural references== The title is a reference to the movie \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\".

Foaled in 1949, the gelding was trained by Will Rogers' prot√©g√©, Les Hilton. He was born in the Los Angeles area but sources disagree as to whether his birthplace was in El Monte or at Harvester Farms in Chatsworth, California.\\"Harvester Farms\\" in Chatsworth Past & Present, February 2015.\\"Mr. Ed's Home May Become A Landmark\\", Los Angeles Daily News as reprinted in Orlando Sentinel, February 2, 1997. In 1968, two years after the cancellation of Mister Ed, at the age of 19, Bamboo began to suffer from a variety of age related ailments, including kidney problems and arthritis. He was euthanized in 1970. A second palomino horse named Pumpkin (alternatively Punkin), which had posed for still pictures used in press kits for the show and some personal appearances, survived until 1979. After Bamboo Harvester's death, the second horse was unofficially known as Mister Ed. == Pedigree == == Death == By 1968, Bamboo Harvester was suffering from a variety of health problems. Controversy surrounds the story of his demise, and there are at least two separate versions of what happened, both from plausible sources which might reasonably be expected to have the correct story. In one version, he was euthanized in 1970 with no publicity, and buried at Snodgrass Farm in Oklahoma. However, a different version was given by Alan Young. Young wrote that he had frequently visited his former co-star in retirement. He states that Mr. Ed died from an inadvertent tranquilizer administered while he was \\"in retirement\\" in a stable in Burbank, California, where he lived with his trainer, Lester Hilton. Young says Hilton was out of town visiting relatives and a temporary caregiver might have seen Ed rolling on the ground, struggling to get up. Young said Ed was a heavy horse and he was not always strong enough to get back on his feet without struggling. The theory is that the caregiver thought the horse was in distress and administered a tranquilizer and for unknown reasons the horse died within hours. The remains were cremated and scattered by Hilton in the Los Angeles area at a spot known only to him.Young, Alan. Mr. Ed and Me 1994, St. Martins Press, New York, , pp. 181-3. In this version it was a different horse that died in Oklahoma in February 1979 which widely thought to be Bamboo Harvester, but instead this horse was merely one that posed for the still pictures of \\"Mr. Ed\\" used by the production company for the show's press kits. After Bamboo Harvester's death in 1970, this horse was unofficially known as Mister Ed, which led to him being reported as such (including sardonic comments on Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update) following his own death. Young said when the Oklahoma horse death story came out in 1979, he knew it was not the real Mr. Ed, but did not have the heart to \\"shatter their illusions\\" that the horse being memorialized was not the real Mr. Ed. He believes it was a horse used for early publicity photos. The real Bamboo Harvester was laid to rest in 1970, on the farm at Snodgrass Farm in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, with no marker. It wasn't until summer 1990 when Mister Ed fans of Oklahoma dedicated a standing granite gravestone to honor the grounds of his grave, though the epitaph uses his stage name and image as 'Mr. Ed', and does not mention his death date of 1970. == References == == External links == * * Bamboo Harvester at AllBreedPedigrees.com Category:Horse actors Category:1949 animal births Category:1970 animal deaths Category:Horses in film and television Category:Individual Arabian and part-Arabian horses ","title":"Bamboo Harvester"},{"id":"1425411","text":"Derna () is a commune in northeastern Bihor County, Cri»ôana, Romania, 50 km from the county seat, Oradea and 35 km from Marghita.

An electric arc furnace (EAF) is a furnace that heats charged material by means of an electric arc. Industrial arc furnaces range in size from small units of approximately one ton capacity (used in foundries for producing cast iron products) up to about 400 ton units used for secondary steelmaking. Arc furnaces used in research laboratories and by dentists may have a capacity of only a few dozen grams. Industrial electric arc furnace temperatures can reach , while laboratory units can exceed . Arc furnaces differ from induction furnaces, in that the charged material is directly exposed to an electric arc and the current in the furnace terminals passes through the charged material. ==History== Stassano furnace exhibited at the Museo della Scienza e della Tecnologia \\"Leonardo da Vinci\\", Milan In the 19th century, a number of men had employed an electric arc to melt iron. Sir Humphry Davy conducted an experimental demonstration in 1810; welding was investigated by Pepys in 1815; Pinchon attempted to create an electrothermic furnace in 1853; and, in 1878‚Äì79, Sir William Siemens took out patents for electric furnaces of the arc type. The first successful and operational furnace was invented by James Burgess Readman in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1888 and patented in 1889. This was specifically for the creation of phosphorus.US patent 417943THe History of Phosphorus, Arthur Toy Further electric arc furnaces were developed by Paul H√©roult, of France, with a commercial plant established in the United States in 1907. The Sanderson brothers formed The Sanderson Brothers steel Co. in Syracuse, New York, installing the first electric arc furnace in the U.S. This furnace is now on display at Station Square, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A schematic cross section through a Heroult arc furnace. E is an electrode (only one shown), raised and lowered by the rack and pinion drive R and S. The interior is lined with refractory brick H, and K denotes the bottom lining. A door at A allows access to the interior. The furnace shell rests on rockers to allow it to be tilted for tapping. Initially \\"electric steel\\" was a specialty product for such uses as machine tools and spring steel. Arc furnaces were also used to prepare calcium carbide for use in carbide lamps. The Stassano electric furnace is an arc type furnace that usually rotates to mix the bath. The Girod furnace is similar to the H√©roult furnace. While EAFs were widely used in World War II for production of alloy steels, it was only later that electric steelmaking began to expand. The low capital cost for a mini-mill‚Äîaround US$140‚Äì200 per ton of annual installed capacity, compared with US$1,000 per ton of annual installed capacity for an integrated steel mill‚Äîallowed mills to be quickly established in war-ravaged Europe, and also allowed them to successfully compete with the big United States steelmakers, such as Bethlehem Steel and U.S. Steel, for low-cost, carbon steel \\"long products\\" (structural steel, rod and bar, wire, and fasteners) in the U.S. market. When Nucor‚Äînow one of the largest steel producers in the U.S.‚Äîdecided to enter the long products market in 1969, they chose to start up a mini-mill, with an EAF as its steelmaking furnace, soon followed by other manufacturers. Whilst Nucor expanded rapidly in the Eastern U.S., the companies that followed them into mini-mill operations concentrated on local markets for long products, where the use of an EAF allowed the plants to vary production according to local demand. This pattern was also followed globally, with EAF steel production primarily used for long products, while integrated mills, using blast furnaces and basic oxygen furnaces, cornered the markets for \\"flat products\\"‚Äîsheet steel and heavier steel plate. In 1987, Nucor made the decision to expand into the flat products market, still using the EAF production method.Preston, R., American Steel. Avon Books, New York, 1991 ==Construction== A schematic cross-section through an EAF. Three electrodes (yellow), molten bath (gold), tapping spout at left, refractory brick movable roof, brick shell, and a refractory-lined bowl-shaped hearth. An electric arc furnace used for steelmaking consists of a refractory-lined vessel, usually water-cooled in larger sizes, covered with a retractable roof, and through which one or more graphite electrodes enter the furnace.H. W. Beaty (ed.), Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, 11th Ed., McGraw Hill, New York 1978, pages 21.171-21.176 The furnace is primarily split into three sections: * the shell, which consists of the sidewalls and lower steel \\"bowl\\"; * the hearth, which consists of the refractory that lines the lower bowl; * the roof, which may be refractory-lined or water-cooled, and can be shaped as a section of a sphere, or as a frustum (conical section). The roof also supports the refractory delta in its centre, through which one or more graphite electrodes enter. The hearth may be hemispherical in shape, or in an eccentric bottom tapping furnace (see below), the hearth has the shape of a halved egg. In modern meltshops, the furnace is often raised off the ground floor, so that ladles and slag pots can easily be maneuvered under either end of the furnace. Separate from the furnace structure is the electrode support and electrical system, and the tilting platform on which the furnace rests. Two configurations are possible: the electrode supports and the roof tilt with the furnace, or are fixed to the raised platform. The roof of an arc furnace removed, showing the three electrodes A typical alternating current furnace is powered by a three-phase electrical supply and therefore has three electrodes.Benoit Boulet, Gino Lalli and Mark Ajersch, Modeling and Control of an Electric Arc Furnace, accessed 2014-05-24 Electrodes are round in section, and typically in segments with threaded couplings, so that as the electrodes wear, new segments can be added. The arc forms between the charged material and the electrode, the charge is heated both by current passing through the charge and by the radiant energy evolved by the arc. The electric arc temperature reaches around 3000 ¬∞C (5000 ¬∞F), thus causing the lower sections of the electrodes to glow incandescently when in operation. The electrodes are automatically raised and lowered by a positioning system, which may use either electric winch hoists or hydraulic cylinders. The regulating system maintains approximately constant current and power input during the melting of the charge, even though scrap may move under the electrodes as it melts. The mast arms holding the electrodes can either carry heavy busbars (which may be hollow water-cooled copper pipes carrying current to the electrode clamps) or be \\"hot arms\\", where the whole arm carries the current, increasing efficiency. Hot arms can be made from copper-clad steel or aluminium. Large water-cooled cables connect the bus tubes or arms with the transformer located adjacent to the furnace. The transformer is installed in a vault and is cooled by pump-circulated transformer oil, with the oil being cooled by water via heat exchangers. The furnace is built on a tilting platform so that the liquid steel can be poured into another vessel for transport. The operation of tilting the furnace to pour molten steel is called \\"tapping\\". Originally, all steelmaking furnaces had a tapping spout closed with refractory that washed out when the furnace was tilted, but often modern furnaces have an eccentric bottom tap-hole (EBT) to reduce inclusion of nitrogen and slag in the liquid steel. These furnaces have a taphole that passes vertically through the hearth and shell, and is set off-centre in the narrow \\"nose\\" of the egg-shaped hearth. It is filled with refractory sand, such as olivine, when it is closed off. Modern plants may have two shells with a single set of electrodes that can be transferred between the two; one shell preheats scrap while the other shell is utilised for meltdown. Other DC-based furnaces have a similar arrangement, but have electrodes for each shell and one set of electronics. AC furnaces usually exhibit a pattern of hot and cold- spots around the hearth perimeter, with the cold-spots located between the electrodes. Modern furnaces mount oxygen-fuel burners in the sidewall and use them to provide chemical energy to the cold-spots, making the heating of the steel more uniform. Additional chemical energy is provided by injecting oxygen and carbon into the furnace; historically this was done through lances (hollow mild-steel tubes) in the slag door, now this is mainly done through wall- mounted injection units that combine the oxygen-fuel burners and the oxygen or carbon injection systems into one unit. A mid-sized modern steelmaking furnace would have a transformer rated about 60,000,000 volt-amperes (60 MVA), with a secondary voltage between 400 and 900 volts and a secondary current in excess of 44,000 amperes. In a modern shop such a furnace would be expected to produce a quantity of 80 metric tonnes of liquid steel in approximately 50 minutes from charging with cold scrap to tapping the furnace. In comparison, basic oxygen furnaces can have a capacity of 150‚Äì300 tonnes per batch, or \\"heat\\", and can produce a heat in 30‚Äì40 minutes. Enormous variations exist in furnace design details and operation, depending on the end product and local conditions, as well as ongoing research to improve furnace efficiency. The largest scrap-only furnace (in terms of tapping weight and transformer rating) is a DC furnace operated by Tokyo Steel in Japan, with a tap weight of 420 metric tonnes and fed by eight 32MVA transformers for 256MVA total power. To produce a ton of steel in an electric arc furnace requires approximately 400 kilowatt-hours per short ton or about 440 kWh per metric tonne; the theoretical minimum amount of energy required to melt a tonne of scrap steel is 300 kWh (melting point 1520 ¬∞C/2768 ¬∞F). Therefore, a 300-tonne, 300 MVA EAF will require approximately 132 MWh of energy to melt the steel, and a \\"power-on time\\" (the time that steel is being melted with an arc) of approximately 37 minutes. Electric arc steelmaking is only economical where there is plentiful, reliable electricity, with a well-developed electrical grid. In many locations, mills operate during off-peak hours when utilities have surplus power generating capacity and the price of electricity is less. ==Operation== An arc furnace pouring out steel into a small ladle car. The transformer vault can be seen at the right side of the picture. For scale, note the operator standing on the platform at upper left. This is a 1941-era photograph and so does not have the extensive dust collection system that a modern installation would have, nor is the operator wearing a hard hat or dust mask. Scrap metal is delivered to a scrap bay, located next to the melt shop. Scrap generally comes in two main grades: shred (whitegoods, cars and other objects made of similar light-gauge steel) and heavy melt (large slabs and beams), along with some direct reduced iron (DRI) or pig iron for chemical balance. Some furnaces melt almost 100% DRI. The scrap is loaded into large buckets called baskets, with \\"clamshell\\" doors for a base. Care is taken to layer the scrap in the basket to ensure good furnace operation; heavy melt is placed on top of a light layer of protective shred, on top of which is placed more shred. These layers should be present in the furnace after charging. After loading, the basket may pass to a scrap pre-heater, which uses hot furnace off-gases to heat the scrap and recover energy, increasing plant efficiency. The scrap basket is then taken to the melt shop, the roof is swung off the furnace, and the furnace is charged with scrap from the basket. Charging is one of the more dangerous operations for the EAF operators. A lot of potential energy is released by the tonnes of falling metal; any liquid metal in the furnace is often displaced upwards and outwards by the solid scrap, and the grease and dust on the scrap is ignited if the furnace is hot, resulting in a fireball erupting. In some twin-shell furnaces, the scrap is charged into the second shell while the first is being melted down, and pre- heated with off-gas from the active shell. Other operations are continuous charging‚Äîpre-heating scrap on a conveyor belt, which then discharges the scrap into the furnace proper, or charging the scrap from a shaft set above the furnace, with off-gases directed through the shaft. Other furnaces can be charged with hot (molten) metal from other operations. After charging, the roof is swung back over the furnace and meltdown commences. The electrodes are lowered onto the scrap, an arc is struck and the electrodes are then set to bore into the layer of shred at the top of the furnace. Lower voltages are selected for this first part of the operation to protect the roof and walls from excessive heat and damage from the arcs. Once the electrodes have reached the heavy melt at the base of the furnace and the arcs are shielded by the scrap, the voltage can be increased and the electrodes raised slightly, lengthening the arcs and increasing power to the melt. This enables a molten pool to form more rapidly, reducing tap-to-tap times. Oxygen is blown into the scrap, combusting or cutting the steel, and extra chemical heat is provided by wall-mounted oxygen-fuel burners. Both processes accelerate scrap meltdown. Supersonic nozzles enable oxygen jets to penetrate foaming slag and reach the liquid bath. An important part of steelmaking is the formation of slag, which floats on the surface of the molten steel. Slag usually consists of metal oxides, and acts as a destination for oxidised impurities, as a thermal blanket (stopping excessive heat loss) and helping to reduce erosion of the refractory lining. For a furnace with basic refractories, which includes most carbon steel-producing furnaces, the usual slag formers are calcium oxide (CaO, in the form of burnt lime) and magnesium oxide (MgO, in the form of dolomite and magnesite). These slag formers are either charged with the scrap, or blown into the furnace during meltdown. Another major component of EAF slag is iron oxide from steel combusting with the injected oxygen. Later in the heat, carbon (in the form of coke or coal) is injected into this slag layer, reacting with the iron oxide to form metallic iron and carbon monoxide gas, which then causes the slag to foam, allowing greater thermal efficiency, and better arc stability and electrical efficiency. The slag blanket also covers the arcs, preventing damage to the furnace roof and sidewalls from radiant heat. Once the initial scrap charge has been melted down, another bucket of scrap can be charged into the furnace, although EAF development is moving towards single-charge designs. The scrap-charging and meltdown process can be repeated as many times as necessary to reach the required heat weight - the number of charges is dependent on the density of scrap; lower-density scrap means more charges. After all scrap charges have completely melted, refining operations take place to check and correct the steel chemistry and superheat the melt above its freezing temperature in preparation for tapping. More slag formers are introduced and more oxygen is blown into the bath, burning out impurities such as silicon, sulfur, phosphorus, aluminium, manganese, and calcium, and removing their oxides to the slag. Removal of carbon takes place after these elements have burnt out first, as they have a greater affinity for oxygen. Metals that have a poorer affinity for oxygen than iron, such as nickel and copper, cannot be removed through oxidation and must be controlled through scrap chemistry alone, such as introducing the direct reduced iron and pig iron mentioned earlier. A foaming slag is maintained throughout, and often overflows the furnace to pour out of the slag door into the slag pit. Temperature sampling and chemical sampling take place via automatic lances. Oxygen and carbon can be automatically measured via special probes that dip into the steel, but for all other elements, a \\"chill\\" sample ‚Äî a small, solidified sample of the steel ‚Äî is analysed on an arc-emission spectrometer. Once the temperature and chemistry are correct, the steel is tapped out into a preheated ladle through tilting the furnace. For plain-carbon steel furnaces, as soon as slag is detected during tapping the furnace is rapidly tilted back towards the deslagging side, minimising slag carryover into the ladle. For some special steel grades, including stainless steel, the slag is poured into the ladle as well, to be treated at the ladle furnace to recover valuable alloying elements. During tapping some alloy additions are introduced into the metal stream, and more fluxes such as lime are added on top of the ladle to begin building a new slag layer. Often, a few tonnes of liquid steel and slag is left in the furnace in order to form a \\"hot heel\\", which helps preheat the next charge of scrap and accelerate its meltdown. During and after tapping, the furnace is \\"turned around\\": the slag door is cleaned of solidified slag, the visible refractories are inspected and water-cooled components checked for leaks, and electrodes are inspected for damage or lengthened through the addition of new segments; the taphole is filled with sand at the completion of tapping. For a 90-tonne, medium-power furnace, the whole process will usually take about 60‚Äì70 minutes from the tapping of one heat to the tapping of the next (the tap-to-tap time). The furnace is completely emptied of steel and slag on a regular basis so that an inspection of the refractories can be made and larger repairs made if necessary. As the refractories are often made from calcined carbonates, they are extremely susceptible to hydration from water, so any suspected leaks from water-cooled components are treated extremely seriously, beyond the immediate concern of potential steam explosions. Excessive refractory wear can lead to breakouts, where the liquid metal and slag penetrate the refractory and furnace shell and escape into the surrounding areas. ==Advantages for steelmaking== The use of EAFs allows steel to be made from a 100% scrap metal feedstock. This greatly reduces the energy required to make steel when compared with primary steelmaking from ores. Another benefit is flexibility: while blast furnaces cannot vary their production by much and can remain in operation for years at a time, EAFs can be rapidly started and stopped, allowing the steel mill to vary production according to demand. Although steelmaking arc furnaces generally use scrap steel as their primary feedstock, if hot metal from a blast furnace or direct- reduced iron is available economically, these can also be used as furnace feed. As EAFs require large amounts of electrical power, many companies schedule their operations to take advantage of off-peak electricity pricing. A typical steelmaking arc furnace is the source of steel for a mini-mill, which may make bars or strip product. Mini-mills can be sited relatively near the markets for steel products, so the transport requirements are less than for an integrated mill, which would commonly be sited near a harbor for better access to shipping. ==Issues== Although the modern electric arc furnace is a highly efficient recycler of steel scrap, operation of an arc furnace shop can have adverse environmental effects. Much of the capital cost of a new installation will be devoted to systems intended to reduce these effects, which include: * Enclosures to reduce high sound levels * Dust collector for furnace off-gas * Slag production * Cooling water demand * Heavy truck traffic for scrap, materials handling, and product * Environmental effects of electricity generation Because of the very dynamic quality of the arc furnace load, power systems may require technical measures to maintain the quality of power for other customers; flicker and harmonic distortion are common power system side- effects of arc furnace operation. ==Other electric arc furnaces== Rendering of a ladle furnace, a variation of the electric arc furnace used for keeping molten steel hot For steelmaking, direct current (DC) arc furnaces are used, with a single electrode in the roof and the current return through a conductive bottom lining or conductive pins in the base. The advantage of DC is lower electrode consumption per ton of steel produced, since only one electrode is used, as well as less electrical harmonics and other similar problems. The size of DC arc furnaces is limited by the current carrying capacity of available electrodes, and the maximum allowable voltage. Maintenance of the conductive furnace hearth is a bottleneck in extended operation of a DC arc furnace. In a steel plant, a ladle furnace (LF) is used to maintain the temperature of liquid steel during processing after tapping from EAF or to change the alloy composition. The ladle is used for the first purpose when there is a delay later in the steelmaking process. The ladle furnace consists of a refractory roof, a heating system, and, when applicable, a provision for injecting argon gas into the bottom of the melt for stirring. Unlike a scrap melting furnace, a ladle furnace does not have a tilting or scrap-charging mechanism. Electric arc furnaces are also used for production of calcium carbide, ferroalloys, and other non-ferrous alloys, and for production of phosphorus. Furnaces for these services are physically different from steel-making furnaces and may operate on a continuous, rather than batch, basis. Continuous-process furnaces may also use paste-type, S√∏derberg electrodes to prevent interruptions from electrode changes. Such a furnace is known as a submerged arc furnace, because the electrode tips are buried in the slag/charge, and arcing occurs through the slag, between the matte and the electrode. A steelmaking arc furnace, by comparison, arcs in the open. The key is the electrical resistance, which is what generates the heat required: the resistance in a steelmaking furnace is the atmosphere, while in a submerged- arc furnace, the slag (or charge) supplies the resistance. The liquid metal formed in either furnace is too conductive to form an effective heat- generating resistance. Amateurs have constructed a variety of arc furnaces, often based on electric arc welding kits contained by silica blocks or flower pots. Though crude, these simple furnaces can melt a wide range of materials, create calcium carbide, and more. ==Cooling methods== Non-pressurized cooling system Smaller arc furnaces may be adequately cooled by circulation of air over structural elements of the shell and roof, but larger installations require intensive forced cooling to maintain the structure within safe operating limits. The furnace shell and roof may be cooled either by water circulated through pipes which form a panel, or by water sprayed on the panel elements. Tubular panels may be replaced when they become cracked or reach their thermal stress life cycle. Spray cooling is the most economical and is the highest efficiency cooling method. A spray cooling piece of equipment can be relined almost endlessly; equipment that lasts 20 years is the norm. However while a tubular leak is immediately noticed in an operating furnace due to the pressure loss alarms on the panels, at this time there exists no immediate way of detecting a very small volume spray cooling leak. These typically hide behind slag coverage and can hydrate the refractory in the hearth leading to a break out of molten metal or in the worst case a steam explosion. ==Plasma arc furnace== A plasma arc furnace (PAF) uses plasma torches instead of graphite electrodes. Each of these torches has a casing with a nozzle and axial tubing for feeding a plasma-forming gas (either nitrogen or argon) and a burnable cylindrical graphite electrode within the tubing. Such furnaces can be called \\"PAM\\" (Plasma Arc Melt) furnaces; they are used extensively in the titanium-melting industry and similar specialty metal industries. ==Vacuum arc remelting== Vacuum arc remelting (VAR) is a secondary remelting process for vacuum refining and manufacturing of ingots with improved chemical and mechanical homogeneity. In critical military and commercial aerospace applications, material engineers commonly specify VIM-VAR steels. VIM means Vacuum Induction Melted and VAR means Vacuum Arc Remelted. VIM-VAR steels become bearings for jet engines, rotor shafts for military helicopters, flap actuators for fighter jets, gears in jet or helicopter transmissions, mounts or fasteners for jet engines, jet tail hooks and other demanding applications. Most grades of steel are melted once and are then cast or teemed into a solid form prior to extensive forging or rolling to a metallurgically-sound form. In contrast, VIM-VAR steels go through two more highly purifying melts under vacuum. After melting in an electric arc furnace and alloying in an argon oxygen decarburization vessel, steels destined for vacuum remelting are cast into ingot molds. The solidified ingots then head for a vacuum induction melting furnace. This vacuum remelting process rids the steel of inclusions and unwanted gases while optimizing the chemical composition. The VIM operation returns these solid ingots to the molten state in the contaminant-free void of a vacuum. This tightly controlled melt often requires up to 24 hours. Still enveloped by the vacuum, the hot metal flows from the VIM furnace crucible into giant electrode molds. A typical electrode is about 15 feet (5 m) tall and will be in various diameters. The electrodes solidify under vacuum. For VIM-VAR steels, the surface of the cooled electrodes must be ground to remove surface irregularities and impurities before the next vacuum remelt. Then the ground electrode is placed in a VAR furnace. In a VAR furnace, the steel gradually melts drop-by-drop in the vacuum-sealed chamber. Vacuum arc remelting further removes lingering inclusions to provide superior steel cleanliness and remove gases like oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen. Controlling the rate at which these droplets form and solidify ensures a consistency of chemistry and microstructure throughout the entire VIM-VAR ingot, making the steel more resistant to fracture or fatigue. This refinement process is essential to meet the performance characteristics of parts like a helicopter rotor shaft, a flap actuator on a military jet, or a bearing in a jet engine. For some commercial or military applications, steel alloys may go through only one vacuum remelt, namely the VAR. For example, steels for solid rocket cases, landing gears, or torsion bars for fighting vehicles typically involve one vacuum remelt. Vacuum arc remelting is also used in production of titanium and other metals which are reactive or in which high purity is required. ==See also== *Flodin process *Vacuum arc remelting ==References== ==Further reading== *J.A.T.

He is best known for his role on the television series Stargate Atlantis as Dr. Carson Beckett. ==Early life== McGillion was born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland. His family moved to Canada when he was two years old. McGillion returned to Scotland with his family during his early teens, for a few years, while his father worked on the Shetland oil rigs. He is the sixth of seven children. He has a degree in teaching and while studying at Brock University, was part of their national championship-winning wrestling team. After graduating, McGillion began his career teaching theatre in Toronto, squeezing in time to attend auditions. He finally made the move to Vancouver, where he has worked extensively in film, TV and theatre. ==Career== McGillion taught scene study at the Vancouver Film School in 1998 and 1999. McGillion played young Ernest Littlefield in Stargate SG-1's first season, in the episode \\"The Torment of Tantalus\\", the first Tau'ri to have passed through the Stargate after its burial. In 2004, McGillion was cast in the science fiction series Stargate Atlantis as the Scottish medical doctor, Carson Beckett. He was initially cast as a recurring guest, but his character appeared so frequently in the show's first season, he was promoted to main character for seasons two and three. Dr. Beckett went back to a recurring character for seasons four and five, where he appears as the clone of the now- deceased Beckett. McGillion has appeared in films, The Traveler with Val Kilmer, Confined with Emma Caulfield, and The Deal with Christian Slater. And has starred in the 2003 multi-award winning film See Grace Fly. He stars in the short film A Fine Young Man, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to rave reviews and won the Leo Awards for Best Short Film and Lead Actor for McGillion. McGillion expressed great interest in auditioning for the role of Montgomery Scott in the 2009 eleventh Star Trek film. ‚ÄúI grew up watching Star Trek and Scotty was my favourite character. It would be a great honour to follow in James Doohan‚Äôs footsteps,\\" McGillion said. He had the endorsement of Chris Doohan, the son of original Scotty actor James Doohan, to play the role of Scotty in the film.The Sunday Post: News GateWorld - McGillion up for 'Star Trek' role Though the part ultimately went to Simon Pegg, McGillion still appeared in the film in a different role. McGillion appeared in Season 7 on the TV series 24 as Dr. Levinson, a doctor who tried to extract a dangerous pathogen from Jack Bauer's bloodstream. McGillion appeared as the husband of a dying patient, in season 5 episode 8 of the TV series The Good Doctor. ==Personal Life== McGillion married Courtney Armstrong on September 18, 2010. They have one son named Hugh who was born on August 5, 2012. ==Filmography== { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" align=\\"center\\" ! colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"background: LightSteelBlue;\\"  Film - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" align=\\"center\\" !

Accessed online December 26, 2006. Dancer Kara O'Toole performing an excerpt from choreographer Pat Graney's Jesus Loves the Little Cowgirls at the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Seattle's Moore Theatre (2007) Seattle is a significant center for the painting, sculpture, textile and studio glass, alternative, urban art, lowbrow (art movement) and performing arts. The century-old Seattle Symphony Orchestra is among the world's most recorded orchestras.Recordings & Broadcasts , Seattle Symphony. Accessed January 27, 2008. The Seattle Opera and Pacific Northwest Ballet, are comparably distinguished. On at least two occasions, Seattle's local popular music scene has burst into the national and even international consciousness, first with a major contribution to garage rock in the mid-1960s, and later as the home of grunge rock in the early 1990s. The city has about twenty live theater venues, and Pioneer Square is one of the country's most prominent art gallery districts. ==19th century== The entertainments in Seattle in its first decade were typical of similar frontier towns. The first established place of entertainment was Henry Yesler's one-story x hall (built 1865), which hosted monologuists, Swiss bellringers, phrenologists and the like. The first professional play in the city was an 1871 production of Uncle Tom's Cabin; numerous Tom Shows would play Seattle in the following years, including one with an entirely African American cast. The first local theater company was the short-lived John Jack Theatrical Company, whose performances in the late 1870s received generally unfavorable reviews. By the 1880s, Seattle was receiving touring opera companies, as well as trained animal acts and the like. Among the actors who visited in the 1890s were Henry Irving, Maurice and Lionel Barrymore, Sidney Drew and Mrs. John Drew, Harry Langdon, W.C. Fields, Eddie Foy, and Sarah Bernhardt. Less reputably, the \\"restricted district\\" below Yesler Way became home to many box houses: half antecedent of vaudeville, half bawdyhouse. The Ladies' Musical Club, founded 1891, quickly became an institution. Active members had to pass an audition. Well into the 20th century it would play a prominent part role in Seattle culture, and still exists as of 2008. The Panic of 1893 nearly destroyed Seattle theater. Immediately before the Yukon Gold Rush brought new wealth to Seattle late in the decade, only the Seattle Theater and the Third Avenue Theater survived, both booked by New York-based Klaw & Erlanger (K&E;), and neither getting any of K&E;'s choicer acts. Even the box house operators had left for greener pastures. Once Seattle became the main supply center for Yukon prospectors, cash from the miners brought back the box houses.Eric L. Flom, Cort, John (1861-1929), HistoryLink.org, August 9, 2001. Accessed December 22, 2007. ==Early 20th century== Success in the Gold Rush era made several box house entrepreneurs think of grander things. John Considine and Alexander Pantages pioneered vaudeville circuits; John Cort became a leading impresario of legitimate theater, at one time controlling more quality theaters around the country than anyone else in America. It would be many decades before Seattle ever again had a comparable impact on American arts and entertainment to what it had in these years. Seattle theater around 1910 included stock shows at the Alhambra and at Pantages' Lois Theater, and vaudeville at Pantages' Crystal and Pantages theaters and at Considine's Orpheum and Star. Cort and others presented various \\"quality\\" entertainment at the Moore and Grand Opera House.Eric L. Flom, Fire burns Seattle's Grand Opera House on November 24, 1906, HistoryLink.org, September 7, 2000. Accessed online January 20, 2008. In addition, the Dream Theater presented silent films with pipe organ accompaniment. The Metropolitan Theatre opened in the Metropolitan Tract in 1911. Owned by New York-based K&E;, it was the grandest theater Seattle had seen up to that time. But the 1912 economic downturn led to a marked decrease in this activity. Although Seattle in the early 20th century was more of a center for variety shows and vaudeville than for the high arts, the Seattle Symphony Orchestra (SSO) was founded in 1903. Nor was the SSO alone: there were two separate Seattle Musical Arts societies, a Schubert Society, and a Seattle Choral Symphony. The Ladies' Musical Society was particularly prominent in bringing world-class performers to Seattle; a pinnacle among their programming was a 1908 concert where Fritz Kreisler and Harold Bauer performed Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata, Brahms' Paganini Variations, Schubert's Moments Musicaux, and Schumann's Fantasiest√ºcke. The Cornish School‚Äîlater the Cornish Institute and now Cornish College of the Arts, an accredited college with courses in the sciences and humanities as well‚Äîwas founded in 1914 by Nellie Cornish. Initially a music school, but later equally known for dance, theater, and visual arts, it thrived for decades under her leadership; although its quality slackened after her death, it eventually recovered and remains an important arts education institution to this day. With no art museums at this time, Seattle played a less prominent role in the visual arts, although Seattle-based Edward S. Curtis and his onetime assistant Imogen Cunningham (who spent about a decade in Seattle) were important in establishing photography as an art form. Caroline Mytinger became known in Seattle for her paintings of natives from the Solomon Islands. ==Emergence of Seattle as an arts center== Entrance and box office of Fifth Avenue Theater Seattle first began to be a visual arts center in the 1920s. Australian painter Ambrose Patterson arrived in 1919. Over the next few decades Mark Tobey, Morris Graves, Kenneth Callahan, Guy Irving Anderson, and Paul Horiuchi would establish themselves as nationally and internationally known artists (see the Northwest School). While few, if any, figures in the \\"high\\" performing arts were based in Seattle in this era, the city was definitely on the national and international arts touring circuit. According to Paul de Barros, in just the single year 1925 Seattle witnessed performances by Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, pianist Sergei Rachmaninoff, and operatic bass Feodor Chaliapin; Hungarian composer and pianist Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi; African American lyric tenor Roland Hayes; and Austrian violinist and composer Fritz Kreisler.Paul de Barros, Jackson Street After Hours, Sasquatch Books, 1993, , p. 17. Seattle had an active jazz scene dating largely from speakeasies during Prohibition, when Mildred Bailey launched her career singing in Seattle.Paul de Barros, Jackson Street After Hours, Sasquatch Books, 1993, , especially p. 26‚Äì27. By mid-century the thriving jazz scene centering in some two dozen clubs along Jackson Street would produce such luminaries as Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, and Ernestine Anderson. The Brothers Four, one of the collegiate folk groups of the late 1950s and early 1960s, were also from Seattle. ==Century 21 Exposition== The Space Needle is the most famous architectural legacy of the Century 21 Exposition. When Seattle decided to try to put itself on the map with the futuristic Century 21 Exposition -- the 1962 World's Fair -- high culture was on the agenda, as well as popular entertainment along the lines of \\"Gracie Hansen's Paradise International\\" and \\"Les Poupees de Paris,\\" an adult-themed puppet show, both of which aspired more to a Gay Nineties naughtiness than to anything artistic.Alan J. Stein, Point 14: Some Things don't Change, HistoryLink Cybertour: Century 21 Exposition. Accessed online January 26, 2008. The Opera House on the grounds of the center was rebuilt for the occasion (and would be rebuilt again 2001-2003 as McCaw Hall); performers at the fair included Igor Stravinsky, Benny Goodman, and Victor Borge; the Seattle Symphony brought in opera singers and staged Aida. The Fine Arts Pavilion (later the Exhibition Hall) managed to bring in works by Titian, Van Dyck, and Monet, as well as more contemporary pieces by Jackson Pollock, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Alexander Calder and by Pacific Northwest artists Tobey, Callahan, and Graves. There was also a significant exhibition of Asian art and Northwest Coast Indian art.Alan J. Stein, Point 17: Culture for the Masses, HistoryLink Cybertour: Century 21 Exposition. Accessed online January 26, 2008. The exposition also commissioned a massive abstract mural by Horiuchi, which still forms the backdrop to the stage at Seattle Center's Mural Amphitheater. Outside of the fair itself, Seattle's bars were filled with the live music that would result just a few years later in the region's first great period as a rock'n'roll mecca. ==After the World's Fair== To retire the US$35,000 debt from the Symphony's production of Aida, Seattle arts patrons founded PONCHO. The resulting gala auction was such a success that it also provided $50,000 to help establish the Seattle Opera, and $16,000 to other organizations. PONCHO would go on to raise over $33 million for the arts over the next several decades.Peter Blecha, PONCHO holds inaugural fundraising auction, to benefit Seattle Symphony, on April 27, 1963, HistoryLink.org, July 16, 2002. Accessed online August 17, 2008. Robert Nesbitt writes in the liner notes to the compilation album Wheedle's Groove that in 1972 the city had \\"a minimum of twenty live music clubs specializing in funk and soul,\\" and that doesn't count other popular music genres. That collection of live music clubs would shrink drastically beginning in the mid-1970s, first with the rise of disco music and recorded dance music in general, and then with Seattle's slightly rundown center becoming a financial district of new skyscrapers. Writing in 1972, Nard Jones remarked on the Seattle telephone directory having \\"three solid columns\\" of art galleries and dealers, representing \\"an astonishing variety\\". Of these he singled out the Richard White Gallery (which in 1973 became Foster/WhiteRegina Hackett, Visionary, art dealer Richard White dies, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, July 26, 2002. Accessed online August 17, 2008) and the avant-garde Manolides Gallery (now defunct) and the Woodside Gallery (later Gordon Woodside / John Braseth Gallery) in the Broadway district of Capitol Hill. ==The 1980s== But it wasn't until the 1980s that Seattle began to be generally recognized as an important performing arts locale. One of the key events in this respect was the Seattle Opera's ambitious and successful staging, under its founding general director Glynn Ross, of Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. Performed in its entirety every summer from 1975 through 1983 back-to-back cycles (first in German, then in English, by 1982, The New York Times reported that Seattle had become a serious rival to Bayreuth. Seattle's Wagner festival has continued to the present day, albeit no longer quite such an ambitious annual event. In 1982 the Seattle Chamber Music Society was formed for the purposes of presenting a summer festival of chamber music. The organization has since expanded to include a winter festival and regularly includes internationally recognized artists such as Cynthia Phelps and James Ehnes on their artist roster. The popular music scene at the time included such teen-pop bands as the Allies (whose song \\"Emma Peel\\" received a good deal of local play, but never broke out nationally) and the Heaters (later \\"the Heats\\"). That same era saw the more sophisticated pop of the short-lived Visible Targets and the still- performing Young Fresh Fellows and The Posies; the pop-punk of The Fastbacks; and the outright punk of the Fartz (later Ten Minute Warning). By the late '80s a group of thirty artists had organized themselves into an organization called Northwest Crafts Alliance.Northwest Crafts Alliance , official site. Accessed online January 26, 2008. This group's purpose is to promote emerging and established artisans through their art show Best of the Northwest. Today this alliance includes over five hundred local, regional, and nationally acclaimed artisans. Conceived in 1980, and incorporated in 1981, Red Sky Poetry Theatre (RSPT) influenced the literary and performance scene in Seattle and the entire West Coast for 25 years. RSPT help organize the Bumbershoot literary arts for many years. It would hold competitions to determine what local talent would perform at Bumbershoot. RSPT performed in many of the same venues as the pregrunge bands. ==Grunge Era== Seattle burst into the popular consciousness with the grunge rock scene of the early 1990s, when Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Temple of the Dog, and Mudhoney, all reached vast audiences. Another punk-influenced but non-grunge Seattle band of the period, The Gits, had garnered great local respect; the brutal murder of Gits lead singer Mia Zapata greatly upset the local music scene. Zapata was memorialized in several ways: the creation of a women's self-defense organization, Home Alive, and an album Viva Zapata by Seven Year Bitch, a Seattle band who had counted her as a mentor. ==Arts in Seattle today== The Solstice Cyclists by tradition usher in the beginning of the free-spirited Summer Solstice Parade & Pageant in the Fremont district of Seattle. ===Annual cultural events, festivals and fairs=== Among Seattle's best-known annual cultural events and fairs are Seattle Art Fair, Seattle International Film Festival, Northwest Folklife over the Memorial Day weekend, numerous Seafair events throughout the summer months (ranging from a Bon Odori celebration to hydroplane races), the Bite of Seattle, and Bumbershoot over the Labor Day weekend. All are typically attended by over 100,000 people annually, as are Hempfest and two separate Independence Day celebrations. Additionally, the city is also home to the Seattle Polish Film Festival (SPFF), an annual film festival showcasing current and past films of Polish cinema. The festival is produced by the Seattle-Gdynia Sister City Association and awards the Seattle Spirit of Polish Cinema awards as well as the Viewers Choice of Best Film. Several dozen Seattle neighborhoods have one or more annual street fairs, and many have an annual parade or foot race. The largest of the street fairs feature hundreds of craft and food booths and multiple stages with live entertainment, and draw more than 100,000 people over the course of a weekend; the smallest are strictly neighborhood affairs with a few dozen craft and food booths, barely distinguishable from more prominent neighborhoods' weekly farmers' markets. Other significant events include numerous Native American pow-wows, a Greek Festival hosted by St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church in Montlake, and numerous ethnic festivals associated with Festal at Seattle Center. As in most large cities, there are numerous other annual events of more limited interest, ranging from book fairs and specialized film festivals to a two-day, 8,000-rider Seattle-to-Portland bicycle ride. ===Performing arts=== Benaroya Hall Seattle is a significant center for the performing arts. The century-old Seattle Symphony Orchestra is among the world's most recorded orchestras and performs primarily at Benaroya Hall. The Seattle Opera and Pacific Northwest Ballet, which perform at McCaw Hall (which opened 2003 on the site of the former Seattle Opera House at Seattle Center), are comparably distinguished, with the Opera being particularly known for its performances of the works of Richard Wagner and the PNB School (founded in 1974) ranking as one of the top three ballet training institutions in the United States.Dina McDermott, Pacific Northwest Ballet: An Insider's Personal View on the Company's Background and History, Criticaldance.com, June 1962. Accessed online January 26, 2008.About the School / PNB School - School Philosophy, Pacific Northwest Ballet official site. Accessed online January 26, 2008. The Seattle Youth Symphony is the largest symphonic youth organization in the United States, and among the most distinguished. The Seattle Flute Society, founded in 1979, is one of the oldest flute associations in the United States. Seattle mourned the loss of one of its best known classical musicians, the Tuba man who was heard by hundreds of thousands in front of sports and arts venues for decades until his death in 2008. The historic 5th Avenue Theatre, built in 1926, continues to stage Broadway quality musical performances featuring both local talent and international stars. The theater's \\"Chinese Timber Architecture\\" is based upon the Forbidden City's Imperial and Summer palaces. In addition, Seattle has about twenty live theater venues, a slim majority of them being associated with fringe theater. It has a strong local scene for poetry slams and other performance poetry, and several venues that routinely present public lectures or readings. The largest of these is Seattle's 900-seat, Roman Revival Town Hall on First Hill. ====Popular music today==== The Presidents of the United States of America, 2005 In popular music, Seattle is often thought of as the home of grunge rock, but it is also home to such varied musicians as avant-garde jazz musicians Bill Frisell and Wayne Horvitz, hot Jazz band leader Glenn Crytzer, rapper Sir Mix-a-Lot, smooth jazz saxophonist Kenny G, and such poppier rock bands as Goodness and The Presidents of the United States of America. Such musicians as Jimi Hendrix, Duff McKagan, Nikki Sixx, and Quincy Jones spent their formative years in Seattle. Ann and Nancy Wilson of the band Heart, often attributed to Seattle, were actually from the neighboring suburb of Bellevue, as was progressive metal band Queensr√øche. Seattle hosts a diverse and influential alternative music scene. The Seattle-based record label Sub Pop was the first to sign Nirvana, and also signed such non-grunge bands as The Postal Service and The Shins. Other Seattle-area bands of note include Pearl Jam, Sunn O))), Acceptance, Aiden, Alien Crime Syndicate, Antlers, Ayron Jones and The Way, The Beautiful Mothers, the Blakes, The Blood Brothers, Blue Scholars, The Catheters, Charlie Drown, Common Heroes, Dangermart, Daphne Loves Derby (Kent), Death Cab for Cutie (Bellingham), Daylight Basement, The Divorce, Dog Bone Sanctuary, Dolour, Drop Six, Drown Mary, Harvey Danger, Fleet Foxes, Foo Fighters, Gatsby's American Dream, Maktub, Metal Church, Minus the Bear, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Modest Mouse (Issaquah), Mudhoney, The Murder City Devils, MxPx (Bremerton), The Myriad, Pedro the Lion, Point One, Ruby Doe, Schoolyard Heroes, Screaming Trees (originally from Ellensburg), Second Coming, Sky Cries Mary, Sleater-Kinney (Olympia), Slicing Grandpa, Smoosh, Soundgarden, Sunny Day Real Estate, Super Deluxe, Supersuckers, Sweet 75, Trial, Turn to Fall, United State of Electronica, Utterance, Vendetta Red, Vexed, Vindaloo, Visqueen, Zeke and The Zero Points. The Experience Music Project (EMP) in Seattle Center is one of the few major institutions anywhere specifically devoted to popular music. Although EMP has scaled back its live music programming from the level of its first few years, every April since 2002 it has hosted the three-day Pop Conference, which brings together a few hundred people for a unique conference that presents the perspectives of academics, writers, artists, and fans. ===Visual arts=== Gallery show opening, Davidson Contemporary, December 2006 Artist Kate Protage in her Pioneer Square studio, September 2006 Being so much younger than the cities of Europe and the Eastern United States, Seattle has a lower profile in terms of art museums than it does in the performing arts. It is nonetheless home to four major art museums and galleries: the Frye Art Museum, the Henry Art Gallery, the Seattle Art Museum, and the Seattle Asian Art Museum. Several Seattle museums and cultural institutions that are not specifically art museums also have excellent art collections, most notably the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, which has an excellent collection of Native American artwork. Seattle has well over 100 non-profit art spaces and numerous commercial art galleries, and likely over a thousand artists' studios Many of the galleries and studios are concentrated in one neighborhood, Pioneer Square. See Museums and galleries of Seattle. In recent decades, Washington State, King County, and Seattle have all allocated a certain percentage of all capital budgets to the arts. Several neighborhoods have also raised funds for art installations, usually sculptures. Among the results are massive murals by Fay Jones,Untitled (fj) , Seattleoutdoorart.com. Accessed online January 26, 2008. Gene Gentry McMahon,Untitled Mural (gm) , Seattleoutdoorart.com.

(Doesn't specifically mention the men's room location.) A magnificent glass tile mosaic mural by Paul Horiuchi forms a backdrop to the stage of the Mural Amphitheater at Seattle Center. Seattle was home of Jacob Lawrence from 1970 until his death in 2000. He is well represented in local corporate collections; several of his pieces are prominently displayed at the Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, as is a piece by one of his colleagues from the U.W. art faculty, Alden Mason, and works by other artists associated with the Pacific Northwest. Probably the most visible public sculpture in Seattle is Jonathan Borofsky's 48-foot kinetic sculpture \\"Hammering Man\\", outside the Seattle Art Museum; probably the most unusual and popular are several pieces in the Fremont neighborhood, including the Fremont Troll, a bronze statue of Lenin formerly in Slovakia, and Richard Beyer's \\"Waiting for the Interurban.\\" ===Alternative, Urban and Pop Surrealism (Low Brow) art scene=== In the last several years, Seattle has become a central hub for the burgeoning Alternative, Urban Art and Low Brow/New Brow art scenes. Frequently situated around several of the city's \\"art walks,\\" which are often put together by young, experimental artists, galleries and collectives like the Greenwood Collective, Roq La Rue and the now closed studios at 619 Western in the historic Pioneer Square. Many of the artists in this scene employ \\"alternative\\" venues, including caf√©s, bars and even exterior building walls, newspaper boxes or re-purposed phone booths, as a way of exposing viewers to their artwork. Moreover, these artists are better known for employing unconventional means of communication, overturning the traditional rules of the art market. These tactics often include happenings, performance art, unsanctioned sculpture, wheatpasting, murals, and aerosol‚Äî-which at times puts members of the scene at odds with both established (and often safer) Seattle artists and city officials. This is also what distinguishes them from much of the art that can be found in the city's traditional art venues. However, it is arguably this willingness to find alternative methods of expression that has given the movement its vibrancy and an increasing significance in the art world as a whole. ==Poetry== === Seattle's Poet Populist=== Seattle is unique in that since 1999 it has been electing a Poet Populist. While similar to Poet Laureate programs, for which dignitaries or government officials select a poet, Seattle conducts a citywide popular vote to determine the Poet Populist. In Seattle, local poets are nominated by Seattle literary organizations for election to the post of Seattle Poet Populist.Seattle City Council News Release: Poet Election Winner to be Announced at Bumbershoot After the formal nomination process voting opens to Seattle residents who generally have a few months to vote for their Poet Populist choice. Thousands of citizens cast their vote for Poet Populist every year. Write-In candidates are also permitted. In the 2007-2008 election George Quibuyen (also known as Geologic) of the Blue Scholars received 96 write-in votes which was the largest total for any write-in candidate in the decade long history of the citywide competition until Ananda Osel earned 391 write-in votes, breaking the record and placing 2nd in the 2008-2009 election. In the past the four candidates with the highest votes totals have hosted readings at Seattle's Richard Hugo House. Poet Populists are nominated in September and are inaugurated in January. During the Poet Populist's term he/she has the responsibility of writing one commissioned poem, and promoting the art of poetry through various performances and teaching opportunities. Past Poet Populist Winners include Barnard Harris, Jr. who won the title in 1999-2000, Bart Baxter (2001‚Äì2002), Tara Hardy (2002‚Äì2003), Pesha Joyce Gertler (2005‚Äì2006), Jourdan Imani Keith (2006‚Äì2007), Cody Walker (2007‚Äì2008) and Mike Hickey (2008‚Äì2009). The program was founded by City Council President Nick Licata, and is supported by resolution of the Seattle City Council.Information from the Seattle city Council: The Seattle Poet Populist is support by the Seattle Weekly, The Seattle Public Library, and the city of Seattle. ===Spoken Word Poetry=== Performance poet Rogue Pinay, 2007 Seattle has been either the birthplace or longtime home to a number of highly respected poets. Probably the earliest was physician Henry A. Smith, who in 1887 wrote and published the English-language text known as \\"Chief Seattle's Reply\\".Jerry L. Clark, Thus Spoke Chief Seattle: The Story of An Undocumented Speech, Prologue, spring 1985, Vol. 18, No. 1 (The National Archives). More recent Seattle poets of note have included Theodore Roethke, Richard Hugo, Denise Levertov, Carolyn Kizer, David Wagoner, Barry Lopez, and Steven \\"Jesse\\" Bernstein, the last a pioneer of performance poetry. Berstein read frequently at Red Sky Poetry Theatre which ran a performance series for 25 years. ==Fiction== In addition to poetry, there have been several notable novels set in Seattle. Among them is Kirby Olson's novel Temping (Seattle: Black Heron Press, 2006) that features a young man working as a temporary secretary who is looking for a little more from life. ==Other museums, aquariums, zoos, and cultural centers== Stranger Genius Award winners pays tribute to Seattle-based writer Jonathan Raban. Daybreak Star Cultural Center There are a number of other museums in Seattle. The Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, on the campus of the University of Washington, has a large collection of botanical, zoological, and geologic specimens in addition to its anthropology collection, which concentrates on Native Americans of the Pacific Northwest but covers the rest of the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific Islands as well. Residents and visitors interested in history, industry, and transportation are served by the Center for Wooden Boats, a maritime heritage museum on Lake Union; the Museum of Flight, which incorporates Boeing's original manufacturing plant; and the Museum of History and Industry, which recently celebrated its 50th anniversary. Popular with tourists are the Seattle duck tour and the Underground Tour which tours the remains of Seattle that existed before the great fire of 1889. The Nordic Heritage Museum in Ballard honors Seattle's Scandinavian immigrants, and the Seattle Metropolitan Police Museum in Pioneer Square honors its police force. And on the campus of Seattle Center are located the Pacific Science Center and Paul Allen's Experience Music Project and Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame. The Seattle Aquarium is located on the Elliott Bay waterfront, and the Woodland Park Zoo is on Phinney Ridge in north Seattle. United Indians of All Tribes operates the Daybreak Star Cultural Center in Discovery Park. ==Notes== ==References== * * * ==External links== *The Stranger: Musicians' Directory lists over 1,000 current Seattle bands, about half with free samples of their music. *The Tashiro Kaplan All Arts Building, housing numerous galleries, artists studios, etc. *Fremont Abbey Arts Center, A nonprofit multi-use performance & educational venue *Scene In Seattle Fine Art Tours Private and Public fine art tours of Seattle's contemporary galleries. *S3A: Seattle's Urban Art Association Founded in 2007, s3a is a group of artists and galleries committed to raising awareness of the alternative art scene in Seattle and the Northwest by chronicling and promoting events, artists and venues.

As boat speed increases from rest, the wavelength of the bow wave increases, and usually its crest-to-trough dimension (height) increases as well. When hull speed is exceeded, a vessel in displacement mode will appear to be climbing up the back of its bow wave. From a technical perspective, at hull speed the bow and stern waves interfere constructively, creating relatively large waves, and thus a relatively large value of wave drag. Ship drag for a displacement hull increases smoothly with speed as hull speed is approached and exceeded, often with no noticeable inflection at hull speed. The concept of hull speed is not used in modern naval architecture, where considerations of speed/length ratio or Froude number are considered more helpful. ==Background== As a ship moves in the water, it creates standing waves that oppose its movement. This effect increases dramatically in full-formed hulls at a Froude number of about 0.35 (which corresponds to a speed/length ratio (see below for definition) of slightly less than 1.20 knot¬∑ft‚àí¬Ω) because of the rapid increase of resistance from the transverse wave train. When the Froude number grows to ~0.40 (speed/length ratio ~1.35), the wave-making resistance increases further from the divergent wave train. This trend of increase in wave-making resistance continues up to a Froude number of ~0.45 (speed/length ratio ~1.50), and peaks at a Froude number of ~0.50 (speed/length ratio ~1.70). This very sharp rise in resistance at speed/length ratio around 1.3 to 1.5 probably seemed insurmountable in early sailing ships and so became an apparent barrier. This led to the concept of hull speed. ==Empirical calculation and speed/length ratio== Hull speed can be calculated by the following formula: v_{hull} \\\\approx 1.34 \\\\times \\\\sqrt{L_{WL}} where :L_{WL} is the length of the waterline in feet, and :v_{hull} is the hull speed of the vessel in knots If the length of waterline is given in metres and desired hull speed in knots, the coefficient is 2.43 kn¬∑m‚àí¬Ω. The constant may be given as 1.34 to 1.51 knot¬∑ft‚àí¬Ω in imperial units (depending on the source), or 4.50 to 5.07 km¬∑h‚àí1¬∑m‚àí¬Ω in metric units, or 1.25 to 1.41 m¬∑s‚àí1¬∑m‚àí¬Ω in SI units. The ratio of speed to \\\\sqrt{L_{WL}} is often called the \\"speed/length ratio\\", even though it is a ratio of speed to the square root of length. ==Hull design implications== Wave-making resistance depends on the proportions and shape of the hull: many modern displacement designs can exceed their hull speed even without planing. These include hulls with very fine ends, long hulls with relatively narrow beam and wave-piercing designs. Such hull forms are commonly used by canoes, competitive rowing boats, catamarans, fast ferries. For example, racing kayaks can exceed hull speed by more than 100% even though they do not plane. Heavy boats with hulls designed for planing generally cannot exceed hull speed without planing. Ultra light displacement boats are designed to plane and thereby circumvent the limitations of hull speed. Semi- displacement hulls are usually intermediate between these two extremes. ==See also== * Ship resistance and propulsion * Wave making resistance ==References== *A simple explanation of hull speed as it relates to heavy and light displacement hulls *Hull speed chart for use with rowed boats *On the subject of high speed monohulls, Daniel Savitsky, Professor Emeritus, Davidson Laboratory, Stevens Institute of Technology *Low Drag Racing Shells ==External links== * Converter: knots > km/h & km/h > knots Category:Marine propulsion Category:Fluid dynamics Category:Water waves ","title":"Hull speed"},{"id":"1425439","text":"Dependency, dependent or depend may refer to: == Computer science == * Dependency (computer science) or coupling, a state in which one object uses a function of another object * Data dependency, which describes a dependence relation between statements in a program * Dependence analysis, in compiler theory * Dependency (UML), a relationship between one element in the Unified Modeling Language * Dependency relation, a type of binary relation in mathematics and computer science. * Functional dependency, a relationship between database attributes allowing normalization. * Dependent type, in computer science and logic, a type that depends on a value * Hidden dependency, a relation in which a change in many areas of a program produces unexpected side-effects * Library dependency, a relationship described in and managed by a software dependency manager tool to mitigate dependency hell == Economics == * Dependant (British English) (Dependent - American English), a person who depends on another as a primary source of income * Dependency ratio, in economics, the ratio of the economically dependent part of the economy to the productive part * Dependency theory, an economic worldview that posits that resources flow from poor states to wealthy states == Linguistics == * Dependent and independent verb forms, distinct verb forms in Goidelic languages used with or without a preceding particle * Dependency grammar is based on the dependency relation between the lexemes of a sentence * Dependent clause == Mathematics == * Dependency relation, a type of binary relation in mathematics and computer science. * Dependent and independent variables, in mathematics, the variable that depends on the independent variable * The absence of independence (probability theory) ** Tail dependence, from probability theory ** Serial dependence, in statistics ** Correlation and dependence ** Mean dependence == Medicine and psychology == * Codependence, a pattern of detrimental behavioral interactions within a dysfunctional relationship * Dependency need, the real need of the organism, or something that individuals cannot provide for themselves * Dependent personality disorder, a personality disorder characterized by a pervasive psychological dependence on other people * Substance dependence, an adaptive state associated with a withdrawal syndrome upon cessation of repeated exposure to a stimulus (e.g., drug intake) ** Physical dependence, dependence that involves persistent physical‚Äìsomatic withdrawal symptoms (e.g., fatigue and delirium tremens) ** Psychological dependence, dependence that involves emotional‚Äìmotivational withdrawal symptoms (e.g., dysphoria and anhedonia) ** Alcohol dependence ** Amphetamine dependence ** Barbiturate dependence ** Benzodiazepine dependence ** Caffeine dependence ** Cannabis dependence ** Cocaine dependence ** Opioid dependence ** Tanning dependence == Political science == * Dependent territory, a classification of territory, especially a region that is not a sovereign state but a possession of same ** The Crown dependencies, three specific dependencies of the United Kingdom: the Isle of Man, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey == Music == * Dependent (record label), a German independent record label that focuses on aggrotech, electro-industrial and futurepop music * Dependent Music, an independent Canadian record label, owned and operated by the artists that were a part of the collective * Dependency (band), an American Christian hardcore band == Philosophy == * Dependent (origination), In Buddhism it means the existence of everything is conditional, dependent on a cause.

A firm believer in absolute monarchy, Ranuccio, in 1594, centralised the administration of Parma and Piacenza, thus rescinding the nobles' hitherto vast prerogative. He is best remembered for the \\"Great Justice\\" of 1612, which saw the executions of a large number of Piacentine nobles suspected of plotting against him. Claudia Colla his mistress and her mother were accused of using witchcraft to stop him from having offsprings, and both were sentenced to death by burning. Because one of the conspirators, Gianfrancesco Sanvitale, falsely implicated several Italian princes, namely Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua and Cesare d'Este, Duke of Modena, in the plot, Vincenzo and Cesare's names appeared on the list of conspirators during formal court proceedings; as a result, Ranuccio's reputation among the rulers of Italy was irreparably damaged because it was evident that he gave credence to Gianfrancesco's obviously false confession. When, consequently, in the early 1620s, Ranuccio was looking for a bride for his younger legitimate son and heir, Odoardo, none of the Italian ruling families were forthcoming with princesses. He did, however, manage to engineer a match with Margherita de' Medici, daughter of Cosimo II of Tuscany. The husband of Margherita Aldobrandini, niece of Pope Clement VIII, Ranuccio, the son of a Portuguese infanta, was considered as a potential king of Portugal when his childless great-uncle King Henry died. The throne, however, passed to Philip II of Spain, whose troops had promptly occupied the country after King Henry's death. His great-uncle King Henry's death triggered the struggle for the throne of Portugal when Ranuccio was 11 years old. As the son of the late elder daughter of Duarte, Duke of Guimar√£es, the only son of King Manuel I whose legitimate descendants survived at that time, Ranuccio was according to the feudal custom the first heir to the throne of Portugal. However his father was an ally and even a subject of the Spanish king, another contender, so Ranuccio's rights were not very forcibly claimed. Instead, Ranuccio's mother's younger sister Catarina, Duchess of Braganza, claimed the throne, very ambitiously, but failed. Under Ranuccio I's rule, the dukedom annexed the territories of Colorno, Sala Baganza, and Montechiarugolo. He guided a cultural renewal in the city of Parma, supporting the arts and constructing the 4,500 seat Farnese Theater. Numerous improvements and monuments in Parma were constructed under Ranuccio I at his behest, including a revitalization of the University of Parma and the final expansion of the city walls. Construction of the Palazzo della Pilotta, the court palace of the Farnese family, was completed in 1620. Ranuccio was succeeded by his son Odoardo, initially under the regency of Ranuccio's brother, Odoardo Farnese. ==Issue== He married Donna Margarita Aldobrandini‚Äîthe daughter of Don Giovanni Francesco Aldobrandini, Prince of Carpineto and his wife the heiress Donna Olimpia Aldobrandini, Princess Campinelli‚Äîon 7 May 1600 in Rome, St. Sixtus.

A hypodermic needle is injected into the affected joint where it delivers a dose of any one of many anti- inflammatory agents, the most common of which are corticosteroids. Hyaluronic acid, because of its high viscosity, is sometimes used to replace bursa fluids. The technique may be used to also withdraw excess fluid from the joint. __TOC__ ==Efficacy in osteoarthritis== In osteoarthritis, joint injection of glucocorticoids (such as hydrocortisone) leads to short term pain relief that may last between a few weeks and a few months. Injections of hyaluronic acid have not produced improvement compared to placebo for knee arthritis, but did increase risk of further pain. In ankle osteoarthritis, evidence is unclear. The effectiveness of injections of platelet-rich plasma is unclear; there are suggestions that such injections improve function but not pain, and are associated with increased risk. A 2015 Cochrane review found that intra-articular corticosteroid injections of the knee did not benefit quality of life and had no effect on knee joint space; clinical effects one to six weeks after injection could not be determined clearly due to poor study quality. Another 2015 study reported negative effects of intra-articular corticosteroid injections at higher doses, and a 2017 trial showed reduction in cartilage thickness with intra-articular triamcinolone every 12 weeks for 2 years compared to placebo. A 2018 study found that intra-articular triamcinolone is associated with an increase in intraocular pressure. ==Ultrasound-guided== Usual standards for musculoskeletal interventional procedures apply include review of previous imaging, informed consent and appropriate local anesthetic. The use of a high-frequency (> 10 MHz) linear array transducer is recommended, but lower-frequency curvilinear probes may be occasionally required to visualize deep structures in larger patients. A preliminary diagnostic sonographic examination, including color Doppler of the area to be punctured is necessary to define the relationship of adjacent neurovascular structures.Initially largely copied from: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY 4.0) Injections should be performed with adherence to aseptic technique although this varies between institutions and radiologists attributable to resources, training, perceived risk and experience. In a survey of 250 health professionals in the United Kingdom, 43.5% believed infection rates were < 1/1000 following intra- articular injections, 33.0% perceived rates were < 1/100, and 2.6% perceived the risk as negligible. Sterile preparation of the entire injection field, including adjacent skin where the gel and probe are applied, is recommended. Areas of superficial infection such as cellulitis or abscess should be avoided to prevent deeper spread. After planning a safe route of access, a line parallel to the long axis of the transducer is drawn on the skin adjacent to the end of transducer where the needle will be introduced. Once the patient's skin is sterilized and initial needle entry is made adjacent to the mark, the probe can be returned quickly to the same location and orientation by aligning to the skin mark. The needle is directed toward the intended target by a freehand technique. The needle size, length and type should be selected based on the site, depth and patient's body habitus. 22‚Äì24G needles are sufficed for most injections.

Men's and women's track & field and cross country running. The men's hockey team has won the University Cup 8 times; in 1998, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2019 as well as finished as runner-up in 1997, 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2015. ==History== The name \\"Varsity Reds\\" was only adopted circa 1993. They are now named the \\"Reds\\" as of 2018. Prior to 1993, every varsity sport, including football, hockey, women's basketball, men's basketball and men's wrestling had a different name: the Red Bombers, Red Devils, Red Bloomers, Red Raiders, and Black Bears, respectively. ==National championships== Men's Soccer (1) *1980 Men's Ice Hockey (8) *1998 *2007 *2009 *2011 *2013 *2016 *2017 *2019 ==Varsity sports== ===Men's hockey=== Aitken University Centre, University of New Brunswick While the details were not recorded, inter-class and inter-club hockey games at the University of New Brunswick were played as early as 1880. The first recorded competitive UNB hockey game was 5 Feb. 1897 against the local detachment of the Royal Regiment of Canadian Infantry (now the 2nd Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment). The game was played in downtown Fredericton at the George Street outdoor rink and UNB lost 3-2. In January 1902, the \\"Red and Black\\" defeated a team of local bank employees 2-1 in their inaugural season in the Fredericton City League. In the early era, \\"home ice\\" was a flooded field borrowed from the local garrison and the players cleared the ice. The team captain doubled as coach and the seven-man starting line-up was the entire team. UNB was a founding member of the Maritime Intercollegiate Hockey League and their first varsity game saw UNB defeat Mount Allison 3-2 in January 1906. After a dispute in 1908, UNB, along with Mount Allison, King‚Äôs, and Acadia, created their own collegiate league the New Brunswick-Nova Scotia League, in parallel with the MIHL (also referred to as the Maritime Interuniversity Inter-scholastic Hockey League). UNB played in both leagues and was the first team to win the NB-NS league title five times, and thus retained ownership of the Summer Trophy. In 1910 the Maritimes Intercollegiate Athletic Association was formed. UNB acquired its first paid coach, Sandy Staples, in 1911. The MIAA evolved into the AUAA in 1974 and the current AUS in 1999. UNB won their first conference title in 1925. UNB won their next title in 1934 and then not again until 1960. In 1964, UNB won their third title in five years and advanced to the 2nd annual CIAU championship in Kingston, Ontario. UNB won the bronze medal game versus the University of Montreal after losing their first game to eventual champions Alberta. The UNB Red Devils lost in the 1984 CIAU Eastern-Canadian Regional playoffs to powerhouse Toronto (two games to none), and they did not return to the national stage until 1997 when the Varsity Reds (the team name changed starting in 1992/93 season) lost the championship game to Guelph. UNB won their first CIS Championship the following year (1998) in Saskatoon and since have won in 2007 (Moncton), 2009 (Thunder Bay), 2011 (Fredericton), 2013 (Saskatoon) 2016 (Halifax), 2017(Fredericton) and 2019 (Lethbridge). The Reds have also won silver medals in 1997 (Toronto), 2000 (Saskatoon), 2004 (Fredericton), 2008 (Moncton) and 2015 (Halifax). UNB has won 17 AUS conference championship banners, including three of the last five. *Lesley Reddon was part of the 1994‚Äì95 UNB team and became the first female goaltender to play in the men's Atlantic Universities Hockey Conference, and perhaps in the CIS. * UNB and the St. Thomas Tommies have a fierce rivalry in men's ice hockey. These games, known as the \\"Battle of the Hill\\" are among the most heavily anticipated and attended despite UNB winning them on a regular basis. * As of 2020, UNB has won eight University Cups (U Sports hockey championships) - more than any other AUS Team, and third among all teams. The team has also won 17 AUS Championships, second only to St Francis Xavier University. === Women's Hockey=== Women's hockey made a return as a varsity team for the 2018-2019 season. The team had been downgraded to a club team after the 2007-2008 season, but after a lengthy legal battle, was reinstated. ===Men's soccer=== *2012: Coach Miles Pinsent was named AUS and CIS coach of the year. *2014: Captain Alexandre Haiart leads the team to victory at the Atlantic University Sport Championship. ===Men's and Women's Track & Field and Cross Country=== The UNB Track and Field team was established during the 2011-2012 school year. It is the only varsity team composed of athletes from both the UNB Fredericton and the UNB Saint John campuses.

Johanna Reid scored the Varsity Reds' lone try, while Julija Rans converted on three penalty goals. After an undefeated season in 2016, the University of New Brunswick Varsity Reds Women's Rugby once again are the Atlantic Collegiate Athletic Association women‚Äôs rugby championship with a 24-0 win over the St. Thomas University Tommies, on 5 November. ==Club sports== ===Baseball=== The UNB Cougars baseball team competes in the Canadian Intercollegiate Baseball Association. *2003 CIBA National Champions (3-0 win over Laval) *2007 CIBA National Champions (2-0 win over Concordia Stingers) *2008 CIBA National Champions (win over McGill) ===Cricket=== In 2005, the UNB Cricket Club organized the initial UNB Cricket Cup, which took place in October. Featuring teams from several Residences on campus, it is believed that it is the first of its kind to take place at UNB. The tournament was won by Harrison House who chased a target of over 150 to beat McLeod by a margin of 1 wicket. All games, of innings comprising 10 overs, took place at Queen's Square Ball Field in Fredericton. The trophy is proudly displayed in the Harrison lounge. In 2007, UNBCC grew to almost 40 members making it arguably the biggest cricket club in the Atlantic Provinces. ===Fencing=== The UNB Fencing Club has been in operation since 1966, competing in the Atlantic Fencing League and the Canadian Fencing Federation. Teams from the club have captured the Alfred Knappe Trophy for Maritime Mixed weapon competition 7 times (1973, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1998, 2001 and 2013) as well as the Atlantic University Mixed Weapon Championship in 2009 (one of only two years it was run), defeating Memorial University for the title. ===Football=== The UNB Red Bombers football team first began play in 1948 in exhibition play before playing in the first intercollegiate Canadian football game played in New Brunswick in 1949. The program was in continuous operation until it was dropped after the 1980 season, with the school making the announcement in June 1981. In their history, the Red Bombers won two Jewett Trophy conference championships in 1969 and 1970, but lost in the following Atlantic Bowls to the McGill Redmen and Ottawa Gee-Gees respectively. In 2008, the University made the announcement that the Red Bombers were to be reborn in 2009 in the Atlantic Football League, along with University of New Brunswick Saint John, Dalhouse University, and Holland College. In 2009 (the inaugural season for the Atlantic Football League), the Red Bombers defeated the UNB SJ Seawolves to capture the first Moosehead Cup championship. The Red Bombers have won the Moosehead Cup four times, most recently in 2019. ===Wrestling=== The UNB wrestling team is known as the Black Bears, and they have produced several CIAU/CIS medals, as well as a record 15 consecutive AUAA titles from 1987-2002. The AUAA title was retired in 2002 ending the run of consecutive titles.The Team captured back to back CIS Team Silver medals in 2010 and 2011, as well as a team bronze in 2015. ===Men's rugby=== The UNB men's rugby team is known as the Ironmen, and they boast numerous New Brunswick and Maritime championships at the 'A' and 'B' levels of competition. ==References== ==External links== * University of New Brunswick Athletics * Patrons of UNB Varsity Reds Soccer * UNB Cougars Baseball * * http://acaa.ca/championships/2015_Rugby_Championships Category:U Sports teams Category:Sports teams in New Brunswick Category:University of New Brunswick Category:Sport in Fredericton ","title":"UNB Reds"},{"id":"1425463","text":"Lansoprazole, sold under the brand name Prevacid among others, is a medication which reduces stomach acid. It is used to treat peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Zollinger‚ÄìEllison syndrome. Effectiveness is similar to other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). It is taken by mouth. Onset is over a few hours and effects last up to a couple of days. Common side effects include constipation, abdominal pain, and nausea. Serious side effects may include osteoporosis, low blood magnesium, Clostridium difficile infection, and pneumonia. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It works by blocking H+/K+-ATPase in the parietal cells of the stomach. Lansoprazole was patented in 1984 and came into medical use in 1992. It is available as a generic medication.

With the assistance of American lobbyist and lawyer William Nelson Cromwell, Bunau-Varilla greatly influenced Washington's decision concerning the construction site for the Panama Canal. He also worked closely with President Theodore Roosevelt in the latter's orchestration of the Panamanian Revolution. ==Early life== Bunau- Varilla was born on 26 July 1859 in Paris, France. After graduating at age 20 from the √âcole Polytechnique, he remained in France for three years. In 1882 he abandoned his career in public works at the √âcole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss√©es and traveled to Panama. He arrived at the isthmus in 1884, employed with Ferdinand de Lesseps's Panama Canal Company. He became general manager of the organization.Anguizola, (1980) pp 1-25/ ==Panama Canal== After the Panama Canal Company went bankrupt in 1888 amidst charges of fraud, Bunau-Varilla was left stranded in Panama. He struggled to find a new way to construct the canal. When the New Panama Canal Company sprang up back in his native France, Bunau-Varilla sailed home, having purchased a large amount of stock. However, as de Lesseps' company had before, the New Panama Canal Company soon abandoned efforts to build the canal. It sold the land in Panama to the United States, in hopes that the company would not fail entirely. U.S. President Grover Cleveland, an anti-imperialist, avoided the canal issue. When the more supportive Theodore Roosevelt became president in 1901, canal planning resumed in the United States. Bunau-Varilla energetically promoted a canal in Panama. With aid from the New Panama Canal Company's New York attorney, William Nelson Cromwell, he persuaded the government to select Panama as the canal site, as opposed to the popular alternative, Nicaragua. When opponents voiced their interest in constructing a canal through Nicaragua, which was a less politically volatile nation, Bunau-Varilla actively lobbied in the United States, for example by distributing Nicaraguan postage stamps featuring belching volcanos to senators. Through lobbying of businessmen, government officials, and the American public, Bunau-Varilla convinced the U.S. Congress to appropriate $40 million to the New Panama Canal Company, under the Spooner Act of 1902. The funds were contingent on negotiating a treaty with Colombia to provide land for the canal in its territory of Panama. ===Separation of Panama from Colombia=== Bunau-Varilla's rejected flag design for Panama Colombia signed the Hay‚ÄìHerr√°n Treaty in 1903, ceding land in Panama to the United States for the canal, but the Senate of Colombia rejected ratification. Bunau-Varilla's company was in danger of losing the $40 million of the Spooner Act, and he drew up plans with Panamanian juntas in New York for war. By the eve of the war, Bunau-Varilla had already drafted the new nation's constitution, flag, and military establishment, and promised to float the entire government on his own checkbook. Bunau-Varilla's flag design was later rejected by the Panamanian revolutionary council on the grounds that it was designed by a foreigner. Although he prepared for a small-scale civil war, violence was limited. As promised, President Roosevelt interposed a U.S. naval fleet between the Colombian forces south of the isthmus and Panamanian separatists.Anguizola, (1980) pp 245-74. ===U.S. control of the canal area=== Bunau-Varilla, as Panama's ambassador to the United States, was invested with plenipotentiary powers by President Manuel Amador. Lacking formal consent of the government of Panama, he entered into negotiations with the American Secretary of State, John Hay, to give control of the Panama Canal area to the U.S. No Panamanians signed the resulting Hay‚ÄìBunau-Varilla Treaty, though it was ratified in Panama on 2 December 1903.47.html Bunau-Varilla had received his ambassadorship through financial assistance to the rebels, he had not lived in Panama for seventeen years, and he never returned, leading to the charge that he was \\"appointed Minister by cable\\". Panamanians long resented his betrayed trust put in him by the new Panamanian authorities. The treaty was finally undone by the Torrijos‚ÄìCarter Treaties in 1977.Charles D. Ameringer, \\"Philippe Bunau-Varilla: New Light on the Panama Canal Treaty.\\" Hispanic American Historical Review 46.1 (1966): 28-52. ==Return to Paris == Bunau-Varilla remained active as an engineer, a financial writer, and a leading specialist in water chlorination. In World War I, he served as an officer in the French army and lost a leg at the Battle of Verdun. As an elder lobbyist, he promoted altering the canal from a lock system to a sea-level waterway. 1938 France awarded him the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor. He died in Paris on 18 May 1940.Anguizola, (1980) pp 299-333. ==Personal income== Bunau-Varilla lived in high style. Guests to his elegant Paris residence often reflected on the immaculate grandeur of the home. He was known to entertain friends and strategic partners at some of the most pricey locations of his time. His money was not made as an engineer during his first stay working on the first Panama Canal project (under de Lesseps). He made his fortune during his second stay in Panama from 1886 to 1889, where he ran his own company, ARTIGUE & SONDEREGGER, together with his brother Maurice, who later became the rich owner of Le Matin, a major Parisian newspaper.Gabriel J Loizillon, The Bunau-Varilla Brothers and the Panama canal. ==See also== *Panama Canal *William Nelson Cromwell ==References== ==Further reading== * Ameringer, Charles D. \\"The Panama Canal Lobby of Philippe Bunau-Varilla and William Nelson Cromwell.\\" American Historical Review, Vol. 68, No. 2, January 1963, pp. 346-363. . * Anguizola, G.

It changes the shape of the lens within the eye, not the size of the pupil which is carried out by the sphincter pupillae muscle and dilator pupillae. ==Structure== ===Development=== The ciliary muscle develops from mesenchyme within the choroid and is considered a cranial neural crest derivative.Dudek RW, Fix JD (2004). \\"Eye\\" (chapter 9).

Retrieved on 2010-01-17 from https://books.google.com/books?id=MmoJQWsJteoC. ===Nerve supply=== Ciliary ganglion with parasympathetic fibers of ciliary nerves. The ciliary muscle receives parasympathetic fibers from the short ciliary nerves that arise from the ciliary ganglion. The sympathetic postganglionic fibers are part of cranial nerve V1 (Nasociliary nerve of the trigeminal), while presynaptic parasympathetic fibers to the ciliary ganglia are from the oculomotor nerve. The postganglionic sympathetic innervation arises from the superior cervical ganglia. Presynaptic parasympathetic signals that originate in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus are carried by cranial nerve III (the oculomotor nerve) and travel through the ciliary ganglion via the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers which travel in the short ciliary nerves and supply the ciliary body and iris. Parasympathetic activation of the M3 muscarinic receptors causes ciliary muscle contraction. The effect of contraction is to decrease the diameter of the ring of ciliary muscle causing relaxation of the zonule fibers, the lens becomes more spherical, increasing its power to refract light for near vision. The parasympathetic tone is dominant when a higher degree of accommodation of the lens is required, such as reading a book. ==Function== ===Accommodation=== The ciliary fibers have circular (Ivanoff), longitudinal (meridional) and radial orientations.Riordan- Eva Paul, \\"Chapter 1. Anatomy & Embryology of the Eye\\" (Chapter). AccessMedicine.com According to Hermann von Helmholtz's theory, the circular ciliary muscle fibers affect zonular fibers in the eye (fibers that suspend the lens in position during accommodation), enabling changes in lens shape for light focusing. When the ciliary muscle contracts, it pulls itself forward and moves the frontal region toward the axis of the eye. This releases the tension on the lens caused by the zonular fibers (fibers that hold or flatten the lens). This release of tension of the zonular fibers causes the lens to become more spherical, adapting to short range focus. Conversely, relaxation of the ciliary muscle causes the zonular fibers to become taut, flattening the lens, increasing the focal distance, increasing long range focus. Although Helmholtz's theory has been widely accepted since 1855, its mechanism still remains controversial. Alternative theories of accommodation have been proposed by others, including L. Johnson, M. Tscherning, and especially Ronald A. Schachar. ===Trabecular meshwork pore size=== Contraction and relaxation of the longitudinal fibers, which insert into the trabecular meshwork in the anterior chamber of the eye, cause an increase and decrease in the meshwork pore size, respectively, facilitating and impeding aqueous humour flow into the canal of Schlemm.Salmon John F, \\"Chapter 11. Glaucoma\\" (Chapter). AccessMedicine.com ==Clinical significance== ===Glaucoma=== Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and closed-angle glaucoma (CAG) may be treated by muscarinic receptor agonists (e.g., pilocarpine), which cause rapid miosis and contraction of the ciliary muscles, opening the trabecular meshwork, facilitating drainage of the aqueous humour into the canal of Schlemm and ultimately decreasing intraocular pressure.Le, Tao T.; Cai, Xumei; Waples- Trefil, Flora. \\"QID: 22067\\".

As a public librarian for forty years Dana promoted the benefits of reading, pioneered direct access to shelved materials, and innovated specialized library services of all types. ==Biography== Dana studied law at Dartmouth College, where he graduated in 1878. Moving to Denver in 1880, Dana passed the Colorado bar and began to practice. Dana moved to New York and was admitted to the bar in 1883. Taking a position as the editor of the Ashby Avalanche in 1885, Dana moved to Minnesota but resettled in Colorado after a short time. Dana married in 1888 to Adine Rowena Wagener. They had no children. Because of the reputation he cultivated as a learned man and his connections in the Denver Public Schools, the superintendent Aaron Gove nominated Dana as the City's first librarian. Dana directed the Denver Public Library from 1889 to 1898, pioneering the patron's right to open stacks, allowing them to browse for themselves instead of having library staff intervening for every request. Dana wanted to update libraries and envisioned them as vibrant community centers rather than collections of relics that appealed to only a small segment of people. Under Dana's leadership the Denver Public Library also pioneered the first-ever collection devoted to children's literature. He was personally opposed to the concept of storytime, preferring for his children's library to focus on the continuing education of school teachers. Dana was the president of the Colorado Library Association in 1895 and served as president of the American Library Association in 1895/96. The city began discussing lowering Dana's salary over mounting public controversy concerning a city tax levied for the school district and, by extension, the library. Dana also drew criticism for circulating \\"gold bug\\" literature at the library; Colorado was economically dependent on mining silver and the gold standard was a political issue. Dana felt that library patrons should have information on both sides of the issue. Back east again, he served as a librarian at the Springfield, Massachusetts public library from 1898 to 1902 and continued many of his Denver policies there. One of the changes Dana implemented at the Springfield library was to the physical building itself. He had workers tear down many of the railings and generally open the floor plan. Dana was adamant that patrons be permitted to browse the stacks: \\"Let the shelves be open, and the public admitted to them, and let the open shelves strike the keynote of the whole administration. The whole library should be permeated with a cheerful and accommodating atmosphere.\\" Although these terms were not invented until nearly a century later, Dana concerned himself heavily with the ergonomics and usability of the library collections and facilities. He left Springfield after refusing to become involved in a power struggle with the library's patrons. Dana provided leadership at the Newark Public Library in Newark, New Jersey, from 1902 until his death in 1929. He established foreign language collections for immigrants and also developed a special collection for the business community. This \\"Business Branch\\" was the first of its kind in the nation.John Cotton Dana Library was erected in 1967 Dana founded the Special Libraries Association, serving as its first president from 1909 to 1911. Dana founded the Newark Museum in 1909, directing it until his death. The Museum was exceptional because it included contemporary American commercial products as folk art as well as factory-made products. John C. Dana personally believed that purchasing European oil painting was a waste of money and thus supported American art movements. He did not like modern art, but he believed in the principle of a universal museum and thus ordered purchases of art associated with the Ashcan School. In 1915, he curated the exhibition \\"Clay Products of New Jersey\\" where he displayed two porcelain toilets from Trenton Potteries, part of his work toward including industrial arts in the museum.Duncan, 115. Cotton also began the Newark Museum's notable Tibetan collection. Dana was quoted as saying, ‚ÄúA great department store, easily reached, open at all hours, is more like a good museum of art than any of the museums we have yet established‚Äù.Hadley, 68. A biographer said of Dana, ‚ÄúHe would have found a library school curriculum intolerable, and doubtless a library school would have found him intolerable‚Äù.Hadley, 12 ==Legacy== After Dana's death, his successor at the Newark Public Library referred to him as ‚ÄúThe First Citizen of Newark‚Äù. The pre-legal department of New Jersey Law School, transitioning from a two-year to a four-year curriculum in 1930, renamed the school Dana College (Watkins 2006, 2). Six years after his death, the city of Newark appointed October 6, 1935 as John Cotton Dana Day. Rutgers- Newark's main library, opened in 1967, is named after Dana. The American Library Association offers the John Cotton Dana Public Relations Award to libraries with exceptional public relations.John Cotton Dana Library Public Relations Award The NJ Associations of Museums has an annual award in his name, presented to an individual \\"for outstanding contributions to the New Jersey museum profession.\\" The highest honor of the Special Libraries Association is the John Cotton Dana Award, recognizing an information professional for lifetime achievement.SLA Awards Descriptions Dana is recognized in the Library Hall of Fame. ==Selected publications== * A Library Primer, 1896. * The New Museum, by John Cotton Dana.

The film explores the issues and difficulties in the world of professional dance, and how each individual copes with the stresses. This movie was Zoe Saldana's and Amanda Schull's film debuts. The single from the film's soundtrack \\"I Wanna Be with You\\" is performed by Mandy Moore. The song became Moore's highest charting song in the US at number 24, becoming her only top 40 song in the nation. It spent 16 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, and peaked during its 9th week on the chart. ==Plot== After a series of countrywide auditions, twelve young dancers gain entry to the American Ballet Academy (which is loosely based on the School of American Ballet), the affiliate school of the American Ballet Company (which appears to be based on either the American Ballet Theatre or the New York City Ballet). They work hard, attending classes every day for weeks to make them the best dancers they can possibly be, and in preparations for a final dance workshop which will determine the three boys and three girls who will be asked to join the company. The workshop will also provide an opportunity for the students to showcase their talent to other ballet companies across the country. Gaining a leading part in the workshop is therefore essential. Tensions mount between Jonathan Reeves (Peter Gallagher), the company's aging choreographer and director, and Cooper Nielson (Ethan Stiefel), his best dancer, who also wants to choreograph. They also have issues because Kathleen Donahue (Julie Kent), Cooper's ex-girlfriend and fellow dancer, left him to wed Jonathan. Star student Maureen (Susan May Pratt), a closet bulimic who seems poised for success, discovers that life is passing her by when she meets a pre-med student (Eion Bailey) who shows her the merits of a life without ballet, to the dismay of her controlling stage mother (Debra Monk), herself a failed ballet dancer and current ABC employee. Sweet Jody Sawyer (Amanda Schull), despite underdeveloped turn out, body type issues, and poor footwork, is determined to dance professionally, but it appears less and less likely as the movie progresses that she will be good enough. Jody's parents, Jonathan, Maureen, and ballet teacher Juliette Simone (Donna Murphy) try to convince Jody to move on from dance and attend college. Jody refuses to give up on her dream of being in a professional ballet company. Talented, but smart aleck Eva Rodriguez (Zoe Saldana; doubled by SAB alumna and former NYCB member Aesha Ash) from Boston loves to dance but seems destined to be stuck in the back of the corps because of her bad attitude. Tensions also arise between Charlie (Sascha Radetsky), a naturally gifted fellow advanced student from Seattle, and Cooper over Jody; Charlie has a crush on Jody, who had a one-night stand with Cooper and remains infatuated with him. Despite Jonathan's objections, Cooper choreographs a rock/pop music- based ballet for the workshop. Three ballets are presented; Jonathan and another choreographer create the other two respectively‚Äîthe two more \\"traditional\\" ballets are not danced to actual ballet music, however. The first (not shown, beyond entrances of the corps and soloist from the wings) is to Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony, while Jonathan's ballet (choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon) is set to Rachmaninov's 2nd Piano Concerto. Cooper's ballet (choreographed by Susan Stroman) mirrors the relationship between himself, Jonathan, and Kathleen. Jody, Charlie, and their gay friend Erik (Shakiem Evans) are set to dance the three lead roles when Erik sprains his ankle in a final rehearsal. To Jonathan's protests and Jody's apprehension, Cooper steps in to fill the role, and the tensions between Jody, Charlie, and Cooper play out on the stage. After the final workshop, Cooper starts his own dance company, much to Jonathan's chagrin, as Cooper's financial backer is a wealthy widow (played by Elizabeth Hubbard) who Jonathan was hoping would donate to American Ballet Company. Cooper asks Jody to be a principal dancer, as her dancing style, though technically deficient, is perfect for his company. He also asks to date her, but Jody turns him down in favor of Charlie. Maureen decides to give up ballet because she finally realizes that ballet is just something she does well and not what she wants in life. She decides to attend regular university and also seek help for her eating disorder. Eva is picked by Jonathan to join ABC after proving her worth in the workshop, surprising everyone by dancing in place of Maureen as the lead in Jonathan's ballet. When Nancy confronts Maureen for quitting, she calls her mother out for her behavior. She points out that ballet was Nancy's passion and that she only did ballet to make Nancy proud because she never got the chance to be a ballet dancer herself. After realizing how unhappy she is, Maureen decided she wants a normal life in attending college and follow her own dreams away from Nancy. Charlie, and fellow advanced students and friends Anna (who was always favored by Jonathan and who danced \\"Gelsey Kirkland's part\\" as the lead in the Italian Symphony ballet; played by SAB alumna and former NYCB corps member Megan Pepin) and Erik are also asked to join the American Ballet Company, and Sergei (Ilia Kulik), Charlie and Erik's roommate and friend, joins his girlfriend Galina in the San Francisco Ballet Company. ==Cast== ==Production== Of the main characters who are dancers, four are professional ballet dancers (Amanda Schull, Ethan Stiefel, Sascha Radetsky, and Julie Kent), one is a professional figure skater (Ilia Kulik), one had ballet training (Zoe Saldana), and two were actors with no ballet training (Susan May Pratt and Shakiem Evans). Body doubles were used for many of the major dance sequences. Dancers from New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theatre filled the classrooms of ABA and corps in the workshop ballets, some of them later became principal dancers, including Gillian Murphy, Stella Abrera, Jonathan Stafford, Jared Angle, Janie Taylor and Rebecca Krohn. The film was choreographed by Susan Stroman who won an American Choreography Award for it. The subplot in which Cooper attracts the financial support of a flirtatious wealthy female philanthropist is mentioned in an August 15, 2004, The New York Times article entitled \\"How Much Is That Dancer in the Program?\\", which revealed that Stiefel has a very similar real-life sponsorship relationship with a philanthropist named Anka Palitz. ==Reception== ===Box office=== The film opened at #6 at the box office making US$4,604,621 in its opening weekend.\\"Weekend Box Office Results for May 12‚Äì14, 2000\\".

The film holds a 42% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 81 reviews with an average rating of 5.03/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Viewers willing to sit through soapy plot contrivances to see some excellent dancing might enjoy Center Stage; for everyone else, there's still always Fame.\\"\\"Center Stage Movie Reviews\\". Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved July 7, 2020. The New York Times critic A. O. Scott wrote for the film: Contactmusic.com gave the film just two stars, commenting that: Other reviewers were more charitable. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that the film \\"ends with two big ballet numbers, wonderfully staged and danced, and along the way there are rehearsals and scenes in a Broadway popular dance studio that have a joy and freedom.\\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/center-stage-2000 Meanwhile, Monica Eng of the Chicago Tribune also gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that \\"In casting for dance talent rather than acting, director Nicolas Hytner may have given up a little dramatic grace, but what he gains in dance footage (that ranges from ballet to jazz to salsa) more than makes up for that.\\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-2000-05-12-0005120260-story.html Eng also wrote that \\"although the film's ending is a little too neat and happy to be realistic, it does leave you with the feeling of young girls taking charge of their lives. In Hollywood films, that's as exotic a dance as you are going to see.\\" ==Soundtrack== The single from the film \\"I Wanna Be with You\\" is performed by Mandy Moore. The song became Moore's highest charting song in the US at number 24, becoming her only top 40 song in the nation. It spent 16 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, and peaked during its 9th week on the chart. The song's video was directed by Nigel Dick. It gained a lot of airplay on MTV and shows a 16-year-old Moore in a dance studio singing to her love interest, who was played by Sascha Radetsky from the film. # \\"I Wanna Be with You\\" ‚Äì Mandy Moore # \\"First Kiss\\" ‚Äì i5 # \\"Don't Get Lost in the Crowd\\" ‚Äì Ashley Ballard # \\"We're Dancing\\" ‚Äì P.Y.T. # \\"Friends Forever\\" ‚Äì Thunderbugs # \\"Get Used to This\\" ‚Äì Cyrena # \\"A Girl Can Dream\\" ‚Äì P.Y.T. # \\"Cosmic Girl\\" ‚Äì Jamiroquai # \\"Higher Ground\\" ‚Äì Red Hot Chili Peppers # \\"Come Baby Come\\" ‚Äì Elvis Crespo & Gizelle D'Cole # \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" ‚Äì Michael Jackson # \\"If I Was the One\\" ‚Äì Ruff Endz # \\"Canned Heat\\" ‚Äì Jamiroquai # \\"I Wanna Be with You\\" (Soul Soul Solution Remix) ‚Äì Mandy Moore ==Sequels== A sequel to the film titled Center Stage: Turn It Up starring Rachele Brooke Smith was first released in cinemas in Australia on October 30, 2008, and debuted in the United States on November 1, 2008, on the Oxygen channel.

Located about 110 km from Alor Setar, it borders Perak and Betong, the southernmost town of Thailand. ==Name== The name Baling can be traced to a series of events detailed in the story of Raja Bersiong (The Fanged King), a popular legend of Kedah, recorded in the Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa. Raja Bersiong was a ruthless vampire-like king with a taste for human blood who preyed on his subjects. His subjects finally rose against him and burned down the palace. When the fanged king fled his palace at the Old Kedah capital in Lembah Bujang, he fled to a place named Merbau and began removing his fangs by twisting them by hand. As a result of the twisting act, Merbau was renamed as Merbau Pulas where pulas in Malay means twisting. After the king had successfully removed both his fangs, he threw them away to a faraway place. The place where he stood when he threw his fangs is known as Baling which means throw and the place believed to be the site where the fangs landed was named Siong, which means fang in Malay, one of the villages in Baling district. The name Baling is also from Thai language \\"Ba Taling\\" (; \\"river bank\\"). ==History== Baling was also the site where the leaders of the Malay Races Liberation Army, the newly formed Malayan Government, and the British met in 1955 to try to end the Malayan Emergency. Tunku Abdul Rahman, a leader of the Malayan government, implored the Communists to give up their arms peacefully by promising that no retaliatory action would be taken against them. The MRLA leader Chin Peng expressed skepticism of a pardon promised by the leader of a nation that had yet to gain its independence (Malaya's independence was gained in two years later in 1957). Chin Peng insisted that the Malayan government and the British endorse the MRLA as a legal Communist Party so that it could run in the forthcoming elections. This was denied, however, and thus no agreement was reached. The towns that Baling has are Kuala Ketil, Parit Panjang, Tawar, Kuala Pegang, Kupang, Baling, Kg Lalang and Kota Baling Jaya Batu 42. One of the small towns in Baling is Parit Panjang. Parit Panjang is situated at the junction of four main roads. The roads are from Kuala Ketil (i.e. from Kulim and Sungai Petani), from Batu Lima, (i.e. from Gurun and Alor Setar),and from Baling Town via Asam Jawa and from Baling via Kuala Pegang. Parit Panjang situated 13 km from Kuala Ketil and 25 km from Sungai Petani. There are six villages in Parit Panjang. The villages are Kg Banggol Berangan, Kg Sungai Tembak, Kg Carok Bakap, Kg Bukit Endoi, Kg Tandop Pisang and Kg Lanai. In Kampung Pisang, Kupang, there is an Islamic religious school, Sekolah Menengah Agama Yayasan Khairiah. Yayasan Khairiah is one of the biggest religious school in Baling. Now it has about 1700 students coming from all over Malaysia. ==Administrative divisions== Map of Baling District Baling District is divided into 8 mukims, which are: * Bakai * Baling town * Bongor * Kupang * Pulai * Siong * Tawar * Teloi Kanan ==Government== The district is administered by the Baling District Council (Majlis Daerah Baling). == Federal Parliament and State Assembly Seats == List of Baling district representatives in the Federal Parliament (Dewan Rakyat) { class=\\"toccolours sortable\\" border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" style=\\"border- collapse:collapse; text-align: left;\\" - ! align=\\"center\\"Parliament !!

Ellen soon learns that this is no ordinary library: the books in it contain the descriptions of people's lives, accurate to the latest second. When a person dies, that book is to be removed, and Ellen is assigned to collect said books. Gloria warns Ellen not to read the books, as that is something firmly prohibited by her employers. However, temptation gets the better of Ellen when she sees her own book, and opens it to the last page which states exactly what she just did. Ellen is disturbed by her noisy neighbours, Edwin and Carla, and decides to have a little revenge. She re-writes a chapter in Edwin's book to get him a job as a Catholic priest, rendering him ineligible to have married Carla and preventing all their boisterous lovemaking. When Ellen gets home that night, she finds her sister Lori consoling the now never-married Carla, who is on the verge of nervous breakdown due to loneliness. To repair the damage done, Ellen rewrites Carla's book to make her happily married to another neighbour, Doug. Now the problem is that Doug is bankrupt from buying gifts for Carla. Ellen then fixes Doug's problems by giving him real estate wealth, but now he is her landlord and her sister is staging a protest against him for raising the rent. Ellen rewrites her own book so that she and Lori live in a house by the sea instead. She returns home to find that Lori drowned while rescuing a little boy from the ocean. Ellen dashes back to the library and is caught by Gloria, who is incensed when she learns the books have been tampered with. She quickly orders Ellen to gather all the books she rewrote and ushers her out of the library. Much to her amazement, Ellen is met outside by Lori, alive and well. Ellen rings the doorbell of the library, but the door is answered by a man who claims to have been living there for the past ten years and who knows nothing of a library there. Convinced that things are now in order, Ellen and Lori leave. ==External links== * * * Postcards from the Zone episode 1.55 The Library Category:1986 American television episodes Category:The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series season 1) episodes Category:Television episodes about multiple time paths fr:On ne vit qu'une fois (La Cinqui√®me Dimension) ","title":"The Library (The Twilight Zone)"},{"id":"1425498","text":"St. Thomas Tommies is the nickname of the athletics teams at St. Thomas University (Canada) (STU) in Fredericton, New Brunswick.

The Flyers were to be charter members of the North American League, which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball, but the team folded in March 2011, before beginning play in the NAL. From 1999 to 2010, the Flyers played their home games at Alexian Field, near the Elgin O'Hare Expressway. They formerly played in Thunder Bay, Ontario, where they were known as the Thunder Bay Whiskey Jacks. The team belonged to the Northern League from 1993 to 2010. On July 27, 2009, the Flyers played host to Battle of the Sexes II, which pitted the Flyers against the National Pro Fastpitch Softball Champions, the Chicago Bandits, featuring star pitcher Jennie Finch. Played by official softball rules, the game was seen by an overflow record crowd of 8,918, and was won by the Bandits 4-2. In 1999, the Flyers hired their first manager, Ron Kittle, best known for his playing days with the Chicago White Sox. The former Chicago Cubs and White Sox player Greg Hibbard was the pitching coach. Kittle did a series of TV commercials to promote the team, using the gimmick \\"Ma Kittle,\\" portraying both himself and his \\"Ma.\\" The ads sparked interest as the Flyers hoped to steal away fans from the nearby Kane County Cougars. The campaign mimicked the highly successful Converse ads in which basketball star Larry Johnson starred as both himself and \\"Gramama.\\" After the 2001 season, however, Kittle resigned as manager, with Jim Boynewicz hired to replace him. In 2004, the Flyers made it to the Northern League Championship Series against the St. Paul Saints. Despite leading the five-game series 2-1, Schaumburg eventually lost the championship. In Game 5, Flyers relief pitcher Lyle Prempas allowed a game-winning grand slam by St. Paul infielder Marc Mirizzi in the ninth inning. The Flyers appeared in the Northern League Playoffs four times (1999, 2003, 2004, 2006) but never won the championship. Among those who played for the Flyers were former Oakland A's outfielder Ozzie Canseco and former Chicago Cubs outfielders Dwight Smith and Brant Brown, as well as, very briefly, John Henry Williams, son of Ted Williams. ==Year-by-year record== { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\"  - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=99 bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=99 bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=2  First Half ! rowspan=99 bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=2  Second Half ! rowspan=99 bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=2  Overall ! rowspan=99 bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=99 bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

This program is called \\"Fan Club: Reality Baseball\\". The program also included online video segments that took fans through the season alongside the team with behind-the- scenes access. The 2007 season saw the Flyers undergo some changes, most notably with the departure of '06 manager Andy McCauley to the Kansas City T-Bones. Steve Maddock became the fourth manager in Flyers history after McCauley left for Kansas City, and he quickly worked to build a team that had only one member carry over from the 2006 campaign. The road for Schaumburg that year proved to be difficult, as the Flyers could manage no more than 20 wins in either half of the season and failed to make the playoffs. ===2008 season=== The Flyers struggled mightily through the 2008 season, dropping their final 14 contests and winning just 30 games. Manager Steve Maddock will not return for the following season, and only six players will don Flyers uniforms on Opening Day 2009. The Flyers did set attendance records on Bearon's Birthday, with 8,636 fans attending the Flyers game with the JackHammers on July 23. ===2009 season=== February 18, 2009: Flyers hold Grand Reopening of The Schaumburg Club to a record off-season crowd of over 300 fans. Mayor Larson was on hand for the ribbon-cutting ceremony and local band 7th Heaven entertained fans and community partners until late in the evening. May 21, 2009: Flyers prepare to unveil their new logo, accompanied by a new black jersey to be worn for all Friday night home games. Along with this new look, the Flyers teamed up with Rainbow Play Systems and Finish Stong Sports Academy to expand their Kidz Zone, located along the left field line. May 22, 2009: Flyers starter Dustin Glant goes the distance, allowing just two runs en route to a 6-2 Flyers home- opener victory over the JackHammers in front of 5,288 fans. May 24, 2009: Glant earns season‚Äôs first Northern League Pitcher of the Week honor, going 2-0 with a sparkling 1.13 ERA in his first two starts of the campaign. May 25, 2009: Flyers turn second triple play in franchise history. With runners on first and second and in motion, Joliet‚Äôs Wally Backman Jr. lined out to 2B Jose Valdez. Valdez threw to first for the second out, and 1B Jason Colson completed the play by firing to SS Travis Brown behind the lead runner at second. June 6, 2009: Richard Mercado blasts season‚Äôs first walk-off homer at Alexian to top Kansas City 7-5, extending the Flyers win-streak to a season- best eight games. June 7, 2009: Flyers players sweep Northern League weekly awards, with Jeff Dunbar taking NL Player of the Week and Craig James earning NL Pitcher of the Week. June 28, 2009: Forty-three-year-old former big-leaguer and Flyers DH Felix Jose improves OBP to season-high .457, a .050 lead over the Northern League‚Äôs second best. June 30, 2009: A Northern League-best nine Flyers are named to the Great Lakes All-Star roster. Honorees are DH Felix Jose, 3B Vince Harrison, OF Jeff Dunbar, 2B Jose Valdez, OF Victor Ferrante, and pitchers Dustin Glant, Cephas Howard, Ed Almonte, and Craig James. July 16, 2009: Hundreds storm the infield at Alexian for the first Richard Allen Jewelers Diamond Dig. Participants are given Popsicle sticks to dig the infield dirt in search of a $1,500 diamond gold ring, which becomes the property of the lucky finder, no strings attached. July 27, 2009: An Alexian Field record crowd of 8,918 witnesses the much-anticipated Battle of the Sexes, as the National Pro Fast-Pitch Softball‚Äôs Chicago Bandits defeats the Flyers 4-2 in a game governed by official softball rules. July 30, 2009: Mayor proclaims Rotary Night. Rotarians and their guests account for 5,000 of the 5,596 people at the game. August 8, 2009: Flyers ride Dustin Glant to 7-2 win over Winnipeg, sealing their first series win at CanWest Park since 2006 and notching back-to-back victories for the first time in nearly a month. August 25, 2009: Flyers RF Victor Ferrante named Northern League Player of the Week, leading the league during the seven-day stretch in total bases (23), RBI (9) and slugging percentage (.920), while batting .440 (11-for-25) with seven runs scored, four doubles, a triple, and two home runs in the week. August 31, 2009: Flyers lead the Northern league in win increase from 2008 to 2009 as well as highest attendance increase from 2008 to 2009. September 16, 2009: Cephas Howard named Northern League Rookie Pitcher of the Year, and shortstop Travis Brown named Northern League Defensive Player of the Year for the 2009 campaign. ===2010 season=== May 20, 2010: Flyers win the season opener with a 10-2 rout in Rockford. Dustin Glant gives up only one earned run on six hits and one walk in seven innings of work to earn the win. Richard Mercardo and Mike Mooney blast their first home runs of the season. May 28, 2010: The Flyers come onto Alexian Field under the temporary team name of Schaumburg Pilots. The Pilots name was upheld throughout the Stanley Cup Finals as a sign of support for the hometown Chicago Blackhawks as they took on (and beat) the Philadelphia Flyers in 6 games. The Pilots beat the Gary Southshore Railcats 5-3 for the team‚Äôs first home win of the season. June 1, 2010: Pilots win 6-5 over the Fargo-Moorhead Redhawks. Richard Mercado hit a two-run homer, and Andre Marshall hit a walk off solo home run to seal the game for the Pilots. June 19, 2010: Ryan Gehring strikes out eight Kansas City T-Bones and allows only five hits en route to a 4-1 Flyers victory. Gehring picked up the win in his first start of the season. June 21, 2010: Dustin Glant tosses a complete game shutout as the Flyers win 2-0 over Joliet. The righty allowed five hits while striking out seven batters. Joey Gomes hit an RBI single in the first inning, and Andre Marshall added a solo home run in the fourth to give the Flyers all they would need for the victory. June 22, 2010: University of Illinois head football coach Ron Zook and head basketball coach Bruce Weber were on hand to witness a 9-5 Flyers victory on Illini night at Alexian Field. June 23, 2010: The Flyers knocked off the Jackhammers in dramatic style with a bottom of the ninth walk-off double by Joe Pauley for a 5-4 win, securing Schaumburg‚Äôs first series sweep of the season. Joey Gomes stretched his league leading hit streak to 18 games, going 3-4 with three singles. June 25, 2010: Flyers need just three hits to secure a 4-3 victory over the Lake County Fielders. Joey Gomes drew two walks in the game, but did not collect a hit, snapping his 19-game hit streak. June 26, 2010: Flyers win their sixth straight game. Dustin Glant pitched 8.2 strong innings before being pulled in a bases loaded jam in the top of the ninth. Evans was able to strike out the Fielder‚Äôs Brian McFall to seal the win for Glant and pick up the save. July 7, 2010: Flyers sweep their series against the Rockford Riverhawks, winning both games of a double-header. Richard Mercado and Joe Nowicki smacked solo home runs for the Flyers in the first game, and Matt Elliott picked up the win in the 5-2 victory. In the second game, Ron Bourquin drew a game-winning bases- loaded walk in the eleventh inning to score Ruddy Yan and win 4-3. July 14, 2010: Dustin Glant and Richard Mercado represent the Schaumburg Flyers in the Northern League All-Star game in Tucson, Arizona. Mercado notched a hit and Glant pitched one inning of relief, giving up one earned run on two hits to go along with a strikeout. The Northern League All-Stars cruised past the Golden League All-Stars 9-3. July 24, 2010: Dustin Glant tosses a complete-game gem, his second of the year, as the Flyers beat the Winnipeg Goldeyes 4-2. Glant allowed just two runs on eight hits with four strikeouts and two walks. July 28, 2010: Newly inducted Hall of Famer Andre Dawson hosts a celebrity softball event at Alexian Field following the Flyers game against Joliet. The Hawk suited up in front of a lively crowd with several other baseball greats and celebrities, including Dale Murphy, Gary Sheffield, Don Zimmer, Vida Blue, Steve McMichael, and Giuliana and Bill Rancic. July 31, 2010: The Flyers beat the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks 9-7 in an impressive display of offense by both teams at Alexian Field. Ruddy Yan hit an inside-the-park home run that scored two. August 2, 2010: Joey Gomes hit two home runs to blast the Flyers past the Riverhawks 12-5. Gomes finished his remarkable night 3-5 with two homers, a double, five RBI, and three runs scored. Mario Delgado returned to the Flyers with a bang as he launched a Brett Durand offering over the center field fence in the second inning. August 11, 2010: Alain Quijano was almost unhittable at Alexian Field. The lefty tossed a one-hit shutout as the Flyers earned a 4-0 win over the Lake County Fielders. It took 116 pitches for Quijano to finish the complete game, striking out seven Fielders along the way. It was the fourth complete game of the season for the Flyers. August 15, 2010: Dustin Glant is named Northern League Player of the Week. Glant went 2-0 in two starts with a 1.80 ERA during the week. August 29, 2010: Flyers sweep Fielders 9-4. Dustin Glant picked up his ninth win of the year, and Kit Pellow and Chris Schultz each hit homers for the Flyers. The first three batters set the tone for the Flyers as Travis Brown led off with a triple. Ruddy Yan followed with a RBI single and Kit Pellow stepped up next with a two run blast to left field for an early 3-0 lead. The Flyers would tack on another run in the second inning with another RBI single from Ruddy Yan. The Fielders would get their four runs sparingly in the game as Higgins led off in the third inning with a double and would eventually come to score. Chris Schultz got the hitting going again in the 4th inning. A big two RBI double followed by Ruddy Yan's third RBI single would make the game 7-1 after four innings. Fielders scored in the sixth inning off a solo home run by Cody Strait, but the Flyers would get the run back in same fashion from Chris Schultz. Mario Delgado followed with a RBI double to finish off the Flyers scoring and putting the lead at 9-2 after six inning. The Fielders would get two more runs in the top of the 8th inning with Cody Strait and Adam Hale getting back to back hits, while both would round the bases to score. Dustin Glant picked up his ninth win of the season, going seven innings, allowing two runs on ten hits with three strikeouts. Alec Lewis got the loss for the Fielders, allowing seven runs in 3.2 innings on ten hits. September 1, 2010: Flyers pitcher Brian McCullough is named the Northern League‚Äôs Pitcher of the Month for August. McCullough allowed only one earned run during August and owned a 3-0 record with a 1.33 ERA in the month. He also had 5 saves during that span, while appearing in 12 games. September 5, 2010 ‚Äì Going into their final game, the Flyers entered Sunday's game up 2-0 in the final series against Winnipeg, and looked to finish the season on a high note with a sweep of the Goldeyes. However, with a late two-RBI double in the 8th inning, Winnipeg shut down those hopes and defeated the Flyers 4-3 in the final game of the 2010 season. The scoring began early off a Chris Schultz home run, his fourth of the season, putting the Flyers up 1-0 in the second inning. Winnipeg would get that run back in the top of the third as Price Kendall hits a single, advanced on a stolen base, and scored on a Kevin West RBI single to tie the game 1-1. Neither team would score until Juan Diaz stepped up to the plate against Alain Quijano in the 6th inning. Diaz connected for his 24th homer of the season, and his 75th RBI to help the Goldeyes take the lead 2-1. The lead would not last long, as the Flyers would answer in the bottom half of the inning. Ruddy Yan got on base with a single and Joey Gomes would drive him in to tie the game 2-2 after six. Once more in the game, back-to-back scoring frames would occur starting with Winnipeg in the top of the 8th inning. Justice would have the game winning 2-RBI single to make the score 4-2, leaving the Flyers left to answer in the bottom half of the inning. Mario Delgado got things rolling with a double, Brett Harker came in to pinch-run, and eventually scored on Gomes' second RBI single of the game, his 53rd RBI of the season. There seemed to be a late surge in the bottom of the ninth, as the Flyers put two on base with two outs to go, but Ruddy Yan could not come through in the clutch, as the Flyers ended their season with a suspenseful 4-3 loss to the Winnipeg Goldeyes, giving the Flyers a 41-59 mark for the year. A tough loss for Alain Quijano, who pitched a complete game, allowing four runs on seven hits with six strikeouts, ending the season with a 3.77 ERA. Chad Benefield would be credited with his first career win as a professional pitcher, throwing 1.2 innings in relief of Goldeyes starter Jason Mackintosh. September 15, 2010: Travis Brown is named the Northern League‚Äôs Top Defensive Player of the Year for the second consecutive season. Brown led all shortstops with 330 assists and 522 total chances, committing only 20 errors (.962), and helping the Flyers post the best fielding percentage in the league (.977). November 18, 2010: Flyers join newly formed North American Baseball League. The league was formed by members of the Golden Baseball League, the Northern League, and the United League. ==Latter years and disbandment== Toward the end of the 2010 season, in late August, Rich Ehrenreich's operating company for the team, Schaumburg Professional Baseball, L.L.C., was stripped of its business registration for nonpayment of sales and withholding taxes. Heavily in debt, Ehrenreich was attempting to sell the team since the beginning of the 2010 season to concentrate on the Lake County Fielders (which Ehrenrich co-owns under a separate operating company), and a proposed sale in June 2010 to Adriano Pedrelli had fallen through. Despite troubles with Illinois tax officials, the Flyers signaled their intent to join the newly formed North American League in the winter of 2010, intending to play the 2011 season in that league. However, the Schaumburg Flyers were served an eviction notice from Alexian Field on February 24, with the team over $900,000 in arrears in rent on Alexian Field going back to 2007. A Cook County judge terminated the lease and ordering Flyers' ownership to pay the village and the Schaumburg Park District (the co-landlords) $551,828.92 in back rent (although the actual amount owed was $920,000 going back to 2007), with the eviction becoming final on March 6, 2011. Three days after the eviction notice became final, the owner of the Joliet Slammers, Alan Oremus, was awarded a new lease on the stadium. A new lease was signed by the new operating company, E.J.I., LLC, in July 2011, after which Oremus sold the franchise to local attorney Patrick A. Salvi. The replacement team, the Schaumburg Boomers, began play in 2012. The assets of the Flyers were auctioned in April 2011, bringing an end to the franchise. The back rent, however, has not been collected by Schaumburg officials. ==Notes== ==References== * nlfan.com - yearly league standings & awards * Flyers eviction postponed, sale expected, triblocal.com * Schaumburg Flyers' business license revoked, dailyherald.com * Costin accuses Schaumburg officials of accepting \\"perks\\", dailyherald.com ==External links== * Official Flyers Website Category:1999 establishments in Illinois Category:2011 disestablishments in Illinois Category:Defunct baseball teams in Chicago Category:North American League teams Category:Northern League (baseball, 1993‚Äì2010) teams Category:Professional baseball teams in Illinois Category:Schaumburg, Illinois Category:Defunct independent baseball league teams Category:Sports clubs disestablished in 2011 Category:Baseball teams established in 1993 Category:Defunct baseball teams in Illinois ","title":"Schaumburg Flyers"},{"id":"1425515","text":"The Brandon Bobcats are the athletic teams that represent Brandon University in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada. Currently, there are six Bobcat teams competing in U Sports as members of the Canada West Universities Athletic Association while the Bobcat soccer teams participate in the Manitoba Colleges Athletic Conference. ==History== Originally known as the Caps and Cappettes, Brandon University Athletics adopted the nickname Bobcats in 1969. Brandon University Athletics once fielded teams in football, field hockey, tennis, badminton, judo, swimming, and ice hockey. The men's ice hockey team ceased in 2002. Brandon College and Brandon University athletes competed in the Western Intercollegiate Athletic Association from 1920 until it was split into two divisions in 1971, at which time the Bobcats joined the Great Plains Athletic Conference. Following the 1998 season, GPAC merged with the Canada West conference, the conference in which the Bobcats have been competing since. ==Teams== ===Men's Basketball=== *Coach: Gil Cheung *Assistant Coach: Brett Nohr *Assistant Coach: Keith Van Walleghem *Assistant Coach: Kevin Phillip *National Championships: 1987, 1988, 1989, 1996 *Canada West Championships: 2002 *GPAC Championships: 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 The Bobcats men's basketball team is a 4-time Canadian University national championship winner, and one of only two Canadian universities to win three-consecutive men's basketball national championships. The Bobcats won titles in 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1996. The school's first national championship came on March 22, 1987. The Bobcats entered the tournament ranked #1 before beating the UBC Thunderbirds 74-66 in the gold medal final. At the 1988 national championship tournament, the Bobcats defeated the Western Mustangs in the semi-final thanks to 21 points and seven rebounds from Partick Jebbison, before beating the Acadia Axemen 81-68 in the gold medal game on March 20, 1988. The Bobcats successfully made it three national championships in a row in 1989. Entering the tournament ranked #1, the Bobcats beat the Toronto Varsity Blues 85-73 in the semi-final behind 18 second-half points from Joey Vickery before Brandon beat the Victoria Vikes 74-73. In 1996 the Bobcats made it back to the national championship final after wins over the Acadia Axemen and Toronto Varsity Blues, setting up a gold medal game against the University of Alberta Golden Bears. The Bobcats were led by fifth-year forward Keith Vassell as he helped the Bobcats to a 79-72 win in what would be his final game after an outstanding playing career. In the 1999/2000 season the Bobcats were silver medal winners after dropping the final to St. Francis Xavier X-Men in a hard- fought 61-60 loss. The following year saw a rematch of the previous year's national championship final between Brandon and St. Francis Xavier. The game went to overtime where StFX eventually came away with an 83-76 win. In 2001/2002 the Bobcats won a bronze medal thanks to a 69-63 win over the Victoria Vikes. In the 2006/2007 academic year, the Bobcats basketball team advanced to the Canadian Basketball Finals. They placed second to the Carleton Ravens, in a hard fought 52-49 game.

The Bobcats have made the Canada West playoffs every year since the 2007-2008 season. The Bobcats have qualified for the U Sports national championship tournament twice. The first appearance was in 2009 where they earned a bronze medal. In 2011, the Bobcats earned a spot in their first ever national championship final. They dropped a hard-fought match to eventual winner Trinity Western Spartans at their home gym. For the 2012-13 season, the Bobcats finished in sixth place in the regular season with a 13-9 record, but excelled in the playoffs and won their first Canada West championship in a victory over the Manitoba Bisons. The team advanced to the 2013 national championships where they finished with a bronze medal after defeating the Western Mustangs. In 2019, they took home the Canada West championship, their second conference title, beating Trinity Western three sets to two. In the national tournament, the Bobcats defeated the Carabins and the Golden Bears to advance to the championship game, but were defeated by the Spartans in a rematch, losing three sets to none. The Bobcats have had two players win the League MVP Award, with Paul Sanderson winning in 2010 and Elliot Viles winning in 2019.

While these common names may apply to several species, Squalus acanthias is distinguished by having two spines (one anterior to each dorsal fin) and lacks an anal fin. It is found mostly in shallow waters and further offshore in most parts of the world, especially in temperate waters. Spiny dogfish in the northern Pacific Ocean have recently been reevaluated and found to constitute a separate species, now known as \\"Pacific spiny dogfish\\", Squalus suckleyi. ==Description and behaviour== The spiny dogfish has dorsal fins, no anal fin, and white spots along its back. The caudal fin has asymmetrical lobes, forming a heterocercal tail. The species name acanthias refers to the shark's two spines. These are used defensively. If captured, the shark can arch its back to pierce its captor with spines near the dorsal fins that secrete a mild venom into its predator. This shark is known to hunt in packs that can range up into the thousands. They are aggressive hunters and have a sizable diet that can range from squid, fish, crab, jellyfish, sea cucumber, shrimp and other invertebrates. Males mature at around 11 years of age, growing to in length; females mature in 18‚Äì21 years and are slightly larger than males, reaching . Both sexes are greyish brown in color and are countershaded. Males are identified by a pair of pelvic fins modified as sperm-transfer organs, or \\"claspers\\". The male inserts one clasper into the female cloaca during copulation. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, which was once called ovoviviparity. Fertilization is internal. The male inserts one clasper into the female oviduct orifice and injects sperm along a groove on the clasper's dorsal section. Immediately following fertilization, the eggs are surrounded by thin shells called \\"candles\\" with one candle usually surrounding several eggs. Mating takes place in the winter months with gestation lasting 22‚Äì24 months. Litters range between two and eleven, but average six or seven. Spiny dogfish are bottom- dwellers. They are commonly found at depths of around , but have been found deeper than . Life span estimates based on analysis of vertebral centra and annuli in the dorsal spines range from 35 to 54 years.

The meat is primarily consumed in England, France, Italy, the Benelux countries, and Germany. The fins and tails are processed into fin needles and are used in less-expensive versions of shark fin soup in Chinese cuisine. In England this and other dogfish are sold in fish-and-chip shops as \\"huss\\", and it was historically sold as \\"rock salmon\\" until the term was outlawed by consumer legislation. In France it is sold as \\"small salmon\\" (saumonette) and in Belgium and Germany it is sold as \\"sea eel\\" (zeepaling and Seeaal, respectively). It is also used as fertilizer, liver oil, and pet food. Because of its availability, cartilaginous skull, and manageable size, it is a popular vertebrate dissection specimen in both high schools and universities. Reported catches in 2000‚Äì2009 varied between 13,800 tonnes (in 2008) and 31,700 tonnes (in 2000). Bottom trawlers and sink gillnets are the primary equipment used to harvest spiny dogfish. In Mid- Atlantic and Southern New England fisheries, they are often caught when harvesting larger groundfish, classified as bycatch, and discarded. Recreational fishing accounts for an insignificant portion of the spiny dogfish harvest. The Cape Cod Commercial Fishermen's Alliance has sponsored an initiative which promotes local, sustainably-caught use of the dogfish in restaurants and fish markets in the Cape Cod area of Massachusetts. The effort is funded by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and attempts to get the public to consume under-utilized fish. ==Conservation status and management== Once the most abundant shark species in the world, populations of Squalus acanthias have declined significantly. They are classified in the IUCN Red List of threatened species as Vulnerable globally and Critically endangered in the Northeast Atlantic, meaning stocks around Europe have decreased by at least 95%. This is a direct result of overfishing to supply northern Europe's taste for rock salmon, saumonette, and zeepaling. Despite these alarming figures, very few management or conservation measures are in place for Squalus acanthias. In EU waters, a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) has been in place since 1999, but until 2007 it only applied to ICES Areas IIa and IV. It was also set well above the actual weight of fish being caught until 2005, rendering it meaningless. Since 2009 a maximum landing size of has been imposed in order to protect the most valuable mature females. The TAC for 2011 was set at 0 tons, ending targeted fishing for the species in EU waters. It remains to be seen if populations will be able to recover. In the recent past the European market for spiny dogfish has increased dramatically, which led to the overfishing and decline of the species. This drastic increase led to the creation and implementation of many fishery management policies placing restrictions on the fishing of spiny dogfish. However, since the species is a late-maturing fish, it takes a while to rebuild the population. In 2010, Greenpeace International added the spiny dogfish to its seafood red list. \\"The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\\"Greenpeace International Seafood Red list In the same year, the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS; also known as the Bonn Convention) listed the species (Northern Hemisphere populations) under Annex I of its Migratory Shark Memorandum of Understanding.Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks. PDF. Cms.int. Retrieved on 2016-11-14. In recent years, however, the US has implemented fishing controls and The proposed quota for 2011 was with a trip limit of , an increase over past years in which the quota has ranged from , with trip limits from . In 2010, NOAA announced the Eastern US Atlantic spiny dogfish stocks to be rebuilt,NOAA Announces Recovery of Spiny Dogfish Stock. greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov and in 2011, concerns about dogfish posing a serious predatory threat to other stocks resulted in an emergency amendment of the quota with nearly being added. In June 2018, the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified Squalus acanthias Linnaeus as \\"Not Threatened\\" with the qualifier \\"Secure Overseas\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. ==Fossil range== As a cartilaginous fish, shark tissues usually do not fossilize. Squalus acanthias fossils date back to the Miocene 11 MYA. ==References== ==External links== * Spiny dogfish at Animal Diversity Web * * * Canadian Shark Research Laboratory * 3D model of a spiny dogfish splanchnocranium * spiny dogfish Category:Fish of the Americas Category:Marine fish of Europe Category:Marine fish of New Zealand Category:Fish of the Mediterranean Sea Category:Fish of the Black Sea Category:Marine fauna of North Africa Category:Marine fauna of East Asia Category:Marine fish of South Africa Category:Marine fish of Southern Australia Category:Cosmopolitan fish spiny dogfish spiny dogfish Category:Species endangered by use as food ","title":"Spiny dogfish"},{"id":"1425525","text":"All for You may refer to: == Music == === Albums === * All for You (Annihilator album), and the title song (see below), 2004 * All for You (Janet Jackson album), and the title song (see below), 2001 * All for You (Show Lo album), 2011 * All for You (Titanium album), and the title song, 2012 * All for You (EP), and the title song, by Sechs Kies, 2020 * All for You: a Dedication to the Nat King Cole Trio, by Diana Krall, 1996 * The Best of Cold Chisel, subtitled All for You, 2011 === Songs === * \\"All for You\\" (1943 song), 1943 * \\"All for You\\" (Ace of Base song), 2010 * \\"All for You\\" (Janet Jackson song), 2001 * \\"All for You\\" (Kate Ryan song), 2006 * \\"All for You\\" (Namie Amuro song), 2004 * \\"All for You\\" (Sister Hazel song), 1997 * \\"All for You\\", by Annihilator from The One * \\"All for You\\", by Black Label Society from Stronger Than Death * \\"All for You\\", by Goodnight Nurse from Always and Never * \\"All for You\\", by Little Brother from The Minstrel Show * \\"All for You\\", by Mot√∂rhead from Rock 'n' Roll * \\"All for You\\", by Opshop from Until the End of Time * \\"All for You\\", by Our Lady Peace from Gravity * \\"All for You\\", by Vaeda from State of Nature * \\"All for You\\", by Years & Years from Palo Santo * \\"All for You\\", from the musical Seussical == Other uses == * All for You Tour, a 2001 tour by Janet Jackson * \\"All for You\\", a Star Wars Tales story collected in Star Wars Tales Volume 5 ","title":"All for You"},{"id":"1425529","text":"The Vancouver Courier is a Canadian semiweekly local newspaper published in Vancouver, British Columbia, by the Van-Net chain owned by Glacier Media Group.

The circulation estimate includes The Vancouver Courier, The Vancouver Courier Downtown, and the Vancouver Courier Westside, and The Vancouver Courier Eastside on Wednesdays. Delivered to homes the paper is distributed from UBC to the Vancouver proper boundary at Boundary Road. The newspaper began as an independent in 1908 as the Eburne News. Within the last 15 years its ownership has had several owners: first, the national Southam Inc. chain, then Hollinger, CanWest, Postmedia, and now Glacier Media. It expanded from being a neighbourhood newspaper to its current citywide circulation area after acquiring the Vancouver Echo and the West End Times. The paper has twice been named \\"Best Community Newspaper in B.C.\\" and was the second runner-up in the Canadian Community Newspaper Association's general excellence competition. Unlike most community newspapers, which feature several news stories on their front pages, the Courier's Friday front page features a single, lengthy feature that runs over several pages. The paper also frequently publishes material on local Vancouver history, usually written by Lisa Smedman. Columnists include Geoff Olson, Allen Garr, Fiona Hughes and Keith Baldrey. The poet Earle Birney worked at the paper in the mid-1920s as a summer reporter and editor.

(1994). Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). pp. 320 - 321. ==History== ===Origins=== A Victorian era, romanticised depiction of Private Farquhar Shaw of the Blackwatch by R. R. McIan, from The Clans of the Scottish Highlands, published in 1845. The progenitor of the Clan Shaw is believed to be one Shaw MacDuff who was a younger son of Duncan, the Thane or Earl of Fife, who was a descendant of Kenneth MacAlpin. Shaw MacDuff was made keeper of Inverness Castle, which was a strategic royal castle, by Malcolm IV of Scotland. His heirs were known as the Mhic anToiseach which means the sons of the Thane and they supported the royal government, consolidating their power around Inverness. Shaw's grandson was Shaw Macwilliam, who in 1263 acquired lands at Rothiemurchus. His son was Farquhard who due to problems with their powerful neighbors the Clan Comyn, made an alliance with the Clan Donald by marrying Mora, daughter of Aonghas M√≥r, Lord of Islay. Farquhard's son was Angus Mackintosh, 6th chief of Clan Mackintosh who married Eva, daughter of the chief of Clan Chattan (Chattan Confederation). Eva's second son John-Angus, was the first chief of Clan Shaw. ===Wars of Scottish Independence=== The feud with the Clan Comyn brought the Chattan Confederation support from Robert the Bruce and they fought for him at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. They also took part in the Scottish invasions of England in 1318 and 1319. ====14th century==== The second chief of Clan Shaw was Shaw Macghillechrist Mhic Iain who was a great grandson of Angus Mackintosh and Eva. He was known as Sgorfhiachlach which means bucktooth and was raised with his cousins at Moy, seat of the Mackintoshes. It seems certain that he was present at the Battle of Invernahavon against the Clan Cameron in 1370. In 1391 Shaw was elected as Captain of Clan Chattan for a raid on Angus under Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan who was known as the \\"Wolf of Badenoch\\". In 1396 Shaw was appointed to lead the Clan Chattan at the Battle of the North Inch, a trial by combat against the Clan Cameron, which took place in front of an audience that included Robert III of Scotland and the Dauphin of France. ===15th, 16th and 17th centuries=== James Shaw of Rothiemurchas was killed at the Battle of Harlaw in 1411.Coventry, Martin. (2008). Castles of the Clans: The Strongholds and Seats of 750 Scottish Families and Clans. pp. 527. . The grandson of Shaw Bucktooth was Aedh who settled at Tordarroch in 1468. He occupied a strategic site near the River Nairn and he and his followers became known as the \\"Clan Ay\\". On 22 May 1543 Angus MacRobert of Tordarroch was one of the signatories of a band of union and management of the Clan Chattan, that was signed at Inverness. Shaw of Tordarroch again signed a similar agreement on 4 April 1609. The clan prospered and Duncan Shaw, Laird of Crathienaird rose to become chamberlain to the Earl of Mar by 1691. ===18th century and Jacobite risings=== On 15 September 1715 Mackintosh of Borlum called out the Clan Chattan to fight for the Jacobite cause in the Jacobite rising of 1715. The Shaw contingent was led by Robert, the younger of Tordarroch and his brother Angus. The Shaw contingent was noted for its discipline, equipment and bravery. Robert and Angus were both imprisoned after the rising had collapsed and Robert died soon after being released in 1718. Angus was transported to Virginia but was pardoned in 1722. Angus never recovered from his experience or the death of his brother and as a result he refused to call out his clan for the Jacobite rising of 1745. However many Shaws rallied to support the Jacobite Stuarts such as James Shaw of Crathienaird. Lady Anne Farquharson- MacKintosh called out the entire Clan Chattan to fight for the Jacobites and two of her most trusted lieutenants were James Shaw and John Shaw of Kinrara. ==Chief== In 1970 Major Iain Shaw of Tordarroch was recognized by the Lord Lyon King of Arms as chief of Clan Shaw. He was the grandfather of the present chief, in an unbroken line of continuity back to the ancient Earls of Fife. The 22nd Chief of the Clan Shaw, John Shaw of Tordarroch, died in Spain on 22, October 2017; his heir and Tanist is his only son Iain Shaw of Tordarroch. ==Clan Castles== *Doune of Rothiemurchus, two miles south of Aviemore in Strathspey is an eighteenth-century mansion which replaced an earlier castle. The lands were held by the Shaws, Mackintoshes and by the Dallases of Cantray. James Shaw of Rothiemurchus was killed at the Battle of Harlaw in 1411. *Tordarroch Castle, seven miles south of Inverness was once a strong tower but little survives. It was held by the Shaws from 1468.

It was released in 1987 for the Atari ST and in 1988 for the Amiga. The game is based on the Steve Jackson Games series Car Wars. The game is set in a hypothetical future in the U.S., where cars are a primary means of protection and defense, and the highways are dangerous stretches of land ruled by gangs and vigilantes with armed vehicles. ==Gameplay== The player creates a character, naming them and distributing 50 points between three skills: driving, marksmanship and mechanic. The player's character starts in New York, Friday 1-1-2030. Without a car the player has to enter amateur night in which they are provided a vehicle in order to raise enough money to buy and equip their own vehicle. With their own vehicle, a character can begin performing courier missions between the various towns along the Atlantic seaboard‚Äîincluding Syracuse, Boston, Manchester (Origin's headquarters at the time, which could be visited in the game) and Atlantic City among a few. The character may also enter more distinguished Arena events to earn money as well as take to the highways to fight the other cars and salvage their parts. In this sense, the game was very open-ended in what the player could do. The game also had a storyline, involving certain critical courier tasks, such as carrying important criminal evidence against \\"Mr. Big\\", through the dangerous terrain between cities. The main feature of the game was combat involving customized vehicles. The vehicle construction portion of the game allowed a variety of power plants, guns, ammunition, mine-layers, smokescreens, oil slicks and rockets to be arranged onto an even larger selection of body and chassis types. The game was developed using a top-down perspective and featured two distinct setting areas: the arena or highway style area and the city area. The highway and arenas allowed acceleration and driving skills to be used in a scrolling screen format, while the city area was a single screen in which stores and other attractions of a city could be visited. ==Reception== Computer Gaming World in 1986 reviewed the game positively, noting, \\"The game design is clean, the graphics excellent and no bugs were found.\\" The immense difficulty of the game was noted, as was the long learning curve. In emphasis, the review suggested bypassing the permanent death feature of the game and expensive in- game clones (backup saves) by making a copy of the character disk, to return to in case of character death. In 1992 and 1994 surveys of science fiction games the magazine gave the title two of five stars, writing that \\"Graphic and game play now appear very dated\\". Compute! stated that Autoduel combined role- playing, arcade, and strategy features, calling it \\"more than a game‚Äîit's a complete system of play ... overall game play is excellent\\". The review concluded with \\"highly recommended\\". Game reviewers Hartley and Pattie Lesser commented on the game in their \\"The Role of Computers\\" column in Dragon #120 (1987), noting that the game \\"combines the feel of the Road Warrior movies with the fantasy role-playing action of the Ultima adventure games.\\" Steve Fuelleman reviewed Autoduel in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer No. 78. Fuelleman commented that \\"The game is pretty well conceived, but is marred by just enough technical flaws, substandard graphics, frustrating limitations, and general user unfriendliness that it just isn't much fun to play.\\" ==Legacy== In 2018, Steve Jackson posted a public request for the Autoduel source code, writing \\"We'd really like to republish Autoduel in more or less its classic form, updated for modern systems.\\" ==See also== *Auto Assault *Car Battler Joe *Darkwind: War on Wheels *Interstate '76 *Roadwar 2000 ==References== ==External links== *Autoduel for the Atari 8-bit family at Atari Mania *Autoduel at the Amiga Hall of Light * *Autoduel at Commodore 64 boxed sets Category:1985 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Apple II games Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:Atari ST games Category:Car Wars Category:Commodore 64 games Category:DOS games Category:Mac OS games Category:Origin Systems games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Vehicular combat games Category:Video games based on board games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in the United States Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games set in the 2030s ","title":"Autoduel"},{"id":"1425534","text":"A multipole expansion is a mathematical series representing a function that depends on angles‚Äîusually the two angles used in the spherical coordinate system for \\\\R^3 (the polar and azimuthal angles). Similarly to Taylor series, multipole expansions are useful because oftentimes only the first few terms are needed to provide a good approximation of the original function. The function being expanded may be real or complex-valued and is defined either on \\\\R^3 or less often on \\\\R^n for some other n. Multipole expansions are very frequently used in the study of electromagnetic and gravitational fields, where the fields at distant points are given in terms of sources in a small region. The multipole expansion with angles is often combined with an expansion in radius. Such a combination gives an expansion describing a function throughout three-dimensional space. The multipole expansion is expressed as a sum of terms with progressively finer angular features (moments). The first (the zeroth-order) term is called the monopole moment, the second (the first-order) term is called the dipole moment, the third (the second-order) the quadrupole moment, the fourth (third-order) term is called the octupole moment, and so on. Given the limitation of Greek numeral prefixes, terms of higher order are conventionally named by adding \\"-pole\\" to the number of poles‚Äîe.g., 32-pole (rarely dotriacontapole or triacontadipole) and 64-pole (rarely tetrahexacontapole or hexacontatetrapole). A multipole moment usually involves powers (or inverse powers) of the distance to the origin, as well as some angular dependence. In principle, a multipole expansion provides an exact description of the potential and generally converges under two conditions: (1) if the sources (e.g. charges) are localized close to the origin and the point at which the potential is observed is far from the origin; or (2) the reverse, i.e., if the sources are located far from the origin and the potential is observed close to the origin. In the first (more common) case, the coefficients of the series expansion are called exterior multipole moments or simply multipole moments whereas, in the second case, they are called interior multipole moments. ==Expansion in spherical harmonics== Most commonly, the series is written as a sum of spherical harmonics. Thus, we might write a function f(\\\\theta,\\\\varphi) as the sum :f(\\\\theta,\\\\varphi) = \\\\sum_{\\\\ell=0}^\\\\infty\\\\, \\\\sum_{m=-\\\\ell}^\\\\ell\\\\, C^m_\\\\ell\\\\, Y^m_\\\\ell(\\\\theta,\\\\varphi). Here, Y^m_\\\\ell(\\\\theta,\\\\varphi) are the standard spherical harmonics, and C^m_\\\\ell are constant coefficients which depend on the function. The term C^0_0 represents the monopole; C^{-1}_1,C^0_1,C^1_1 represent the dipole; and so on. Equivalently, the series is also frequently written as :f(\\\\theta,\\\\varphi) = C + C_i n^i + C_{ij}n^i n^j + C_{ijk}n^i n^j n^k + C_{ijk\\\\ell}n^i n^j n^k n^\\\\ell + \\\\cdots. Here, the n^i represent the components of a unit vector in the direction given by the angles \\\\theta and \\\\varphi, and indices are implicitly summed. Here, the term C is the monopole; C_i is a set of three numbers representing the dipole; and so on. In the above expansions, the coefficients may be real or complex. If the function being expressed as a multipole expansion is real, however, the coefficients must satisfy certain properties. In the spherical harmonic expansion, we must have :C_\\\\ell^{-m} = (-1)^m C^{m\\\\ast}_\\\\ell\\\\ . In the multi-vector expansion, each coefficient must be real: :C=C^\\\\ast;\\\\ C_i = C_i^\\\\ast;\\\\ C_{ij} = C_{ij}^\\\\ast;\\\\ C_{ijk} = C_{ijk}^\\\\ast;\\\\ \\\\ldots While expansions of scalar functions are by far the most common application of multipole expansions, they may also be generalized to describe tensors of arbitrary rank. This finds use in multipole expansions of the vector potential in electromagnetism, or the metric perturbation in the description of gravitational waves. For describing functions of three dimensions, away from the coordinate origin, the coefficients of the multipole expansion can be written as functions of the distance to the origin, r‚Äîmost frequently, as a Laurent series in powers of r. For example, to describe the electromagnetic potential, V, from a source in a small region near the origin, the coefficients may be written as: :V(r,\\\\theta,\\\\varphi) = \\\\sum_{\\\\ell=0}^\\\\infty\\\\, \\\\sum_{m=-l}^\\\\ell C^m_\\\\ell(r)\\\\, Y^m_\\\\ell(\\\\theta,\\\\varphi)= \\\\sum_{j=1}^\\\\infty\\\\, \\\\sum_{\\\\ell=0}^\\\\infty\\\\, \\\\sum_{m=-l}^\\\\ell \\\\frac{D^m_{\\\\ell,j}}{r^j}\\\\, Y^m_\\\\ell(\\\\theta,\\\\varphi) . ==Applications== Multipole expansions are widely used in problems involving gravitational fields of systems of masses, electric and magnetic fields of charge and current distributions, and the propagation of electromagnetic waves. A classic example is the calculation of the exterior multipole moments of atomic nuclei from their interaction energies with the interior multipoles of the electronic orbitals. The multipole moments of the nuclei report on the distribution of charges within the nucleus and, thus, on the shape of the nucleus. Truncation of the multipole expansion to its first non-zero term is often useful for theoretical calculations. Multipole expansions are also useful in numerical simulations, and form the basis of the Fast Multipole Method of Greengard and Rokhlin, a general technique for efficient computation of energies and forces in systems of interacting particles. The basic idea is to decompose the particles into groups; particles within a group interact normally (i.e., by the full potential), whereas the energies and forces between groups of particles are calculated from their multipole moments. The efficiency of the fast multipole method is generally similar to that of Ewald summation, but is superior if the particles are clustered, i.e. the system has large density fluctuations. The open source Python package multipoles is available for computing spherical multipole moments and multipole expansions. ==Multipole expansion of a potential outside an electrostatic charge distribution== Consider a discrete charge distribution consisting of N point charges qi with position vectors ri. We assume the charges to be clustered around the origin, so that for all i: ri < rmax, where rmax has some finite value. The potential V(R), due to the charge distribution, at a point R outside the charge distribution, i.e., , can be expanded in powers of 1/R. Two ways of making this expansion can be found in the literature. The first is a Taylor series in the Cartesian coordinates x, y, and z, while the second is in terms of spherical harmonics which depend on spherical polar coordinates. The Cartesian approach has the advantage that no prior knowledge of Legendre functions, spherical harmonics, etc., is required. Its disadvantage is that the derivations are fairly cumbersome (in fact a large part of it is the implicit rederivation of the Legendre expansion of , which was done once and for all by Legendre in the 1780s). Also it is difficult to give a closed expression for a general term of the multipole expansion--usually only the first few terms are given followed by an ellipsis. ===Expansion in Cartesian coordinates=== The Taylor expansion of an arbitrary function around the origin is : v(\\\\mathbf{r}- \\\\mathbf{R}) = v(\\\\mathbf{R}) - \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=x,y,z} r_\\\\alpha v_\\\\alpha(\\\\mathbf{R}) +\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=x,y,z}\\\\sum_{\\\\beta=x,y,z} r_\\\\alpha r_\\\\beta v_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(\\\\mathbf{R}) -\\\\cdots+\\\\cdots with : v_\\\\alpha(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\equiv\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial v(\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{R}) }{\\\\partial r_\\\\alpha}\\\\right)_{\\\\mathbf{r}= \\\\mathbf0}\\\\quad\\\\hbox{and} \\\\quad v_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\equiv\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 v(\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{R}) }{\\\\partial r_{\\\\alpha}\\\\partial r_{\\\\beta}}\\\\right)_{\\\\mathbf{r}= \\\\mathbf0} . If satisfies the Laplace equation : \\\\left( abla^2 v(\\\\mathbf{r}- \\\\mathbf{R})\\\\right)_{\\\\mathbf{r}=\\\\mathbf0} = \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=x,y,z} v_{\\\\alpha\\\\alpha}(\\\\mathbf{R}) = 0 then the expansion can be rewritten in terms of the components of a traceless Cartesian second rank tensor: : \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=x,y,z}\\\\sum_{\\\\beta=x,y,z} r_\\\\alpha r_\\\\beta v_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(\\\\mathbf{R}) = \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=x,y,z}\\\\sum_{\\\\beta=x,y,z} (3r_\\\\alpha r_\\\\beta - \\\\delta_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} r^2) v_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(\\\\mathbf{R}) , where Œ¥Œ±Œ≤ is the Kronecker delta and . Removing the trace is common, because it takes the rotationally invariant r2 out of the second rank tensor. Example Consider now the following form of : : v(\\\\mathbf{r}- \\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\equiv \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathbf{r}- \\\\mathbf{R}} . Then by direct differentiation it follows that : v(\\\\mathbf{R}) = \\\\frac{1}{R},\\\\quad v_\\\\alpha(\\\\mathbf{R})= -\\\\frac{R_\\\\alpha}{R^3},\\\\quad \\\\hbox{and}\\\\quad v_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(\\\\mathbf{R}) = \\\\frac{3R_\\\\alpha R_\\\\beta- \\\\delta_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}R^2}{R^5} . Define a monopole, dipole, and (traceless) quadrupole by, respectively, : q_\\\\mathrm{tot} \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{i=1}^N q_i , \\\\quad P_\\\\alpha \\\\equiv\\\\sum_{i=1}^N q_i r_{i\\\\alpha} , \\\\quad \\\\hbox{and}\\\\quad Q_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{i=1}^N q_i (3r_{i\\\\alpha} r_{i\\\\beta} - \\\\delta_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} r_i^2) , and we obtain finally the first few terms of the multipole expansion of the total potential, which is the sum of the Coulomb potentials of the separate charges: : 4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0 V(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{i=1}^N q_i v(\\\\mathbf{r}_i-\\\\mathbf{R}) ::::: = \\\\frac{q_\\\\mathrm{tot}}{R} + \\\\frac{1}{R^3}\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=x,y,z} P_\\\\alpha R_\\\\alpha + \\\\frac{1}{2 R^5}\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta=x,y,z} Q_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} R_\\\\alpha R_\\\\beta +\\\\cdots This expansion of the potential of a discrete charge distribution is very similar to the one in real solid harmonics given below. The main difference is that the present one is in terms of linear dependent quantities, for : \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha} v_{\\\\alpha\\\\alpha} = 0 \\\\quad \\\\hbox{and} \\\\quad \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha} Q_{\\\\alpha\\\\alpha} = 0 . NOTE: If the charge distribution consists of two charges of opposite sign which are an infinitesimal distance d apart, so that , it is easily shown that the only non-vanishing term in the expansion is : V(\\\\mathbf{R}) = \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0 R^3} (\\\\mathbf{P}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{R}) , the electric dipolar potential field. ===Spherical form=== The potential V(R) at a point R outside the charge distribution, i.e. , can be expanded by the Laplace expansion: : V(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\frac{q_i}{4\\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{R}} =\\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\sum_{\\\\ell=0}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{m=-\\\\ell}^{\\\\ell} (-1)^m I^{-m}_\\\\ell(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\sum_{i=1}^N q_i R^{m}_\\\\ell(\\\\mathbf{r}_i), where I^{-m}_{\\\\ell}(\\\\mathbf{R}) is an irregular solid harmonic (defined below as a spherical harmonic function divided by r^{\\\\ell+1}) and R^m_{\\\\ell}(\\\\mathbf{r}) is a regular solid harmonic (a spherical harmonic times r‚Ñì). We define the spherical multipole moment of the charge distribution as follows : Q^m_\\\\ell \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{i=1}^N q_i R^{m}_\\\\ell(\\\\mathbf{r}_i),\\\\qquad -\\\\ell \\\\le m \\\\le \\\\ell. Note that a multipole moment is solely determined by the charge distribution (the positions and magnitudes of the N charges). A spherical harmonic depends on the unit vector \\\\hat{R}. (A unit vector is determined by two spherical polar angles.) Thus, by definition, the irregular solid harmonics can be written as :I^m_{\\\\ell}(\\\\mathbf{R}) \\\\equiv \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{2\\\\ell+1}} \\\\frac{Y^m_{\\\\ell}(\\\\hat{R})}{R^{\\\\ell+1}} so that the multipole expansion of the field V(R) at the point R outside the charge distribution is given by : V(\\\\mathbf{R}) =\\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\sum_{\\\\ell=0}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{m=-\\\\ell}^{\\\\ell} (-1)^m I^{-m}_\\\\ell(\\\\mathbf{R}) Q^m_\\\\ell ::: = \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\sum_{\\\\ell=0}^\\\\infty \\\\left[\\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{2\\\\ell+1}\\\\right]^{1/2}\\\\; \\\\frac{1}{R^{\\\\ell+1}}\\\\; \\\\sum_{m=-\\\\ell}^{\\\\ell} (-1)^m Y^{-m}_\\\\ell(\\\\hat{R}) Q^m_\\\\ell, \\\\qquad R > r_{\\\\mathrm{max}}. This expansion is completely general in that it gives a closed form for all terms, not just for the first few. It shows that the spherical multipole moments appear as coefficients in the 1/R expansion of the potential. It is of interest to consider the first few terms in real form, which are the only terms commonly found in undergraduate textbooks. Since the summand of the m summation is invariant under a unitary transformation of both factors simultaneously and since transformation of complex spherical harmonics to real form is by a unitary transformation, we can simply substitute real irregular solid harmonics and real multipole moments. The term becomes : V_{\\\\ell=0}(\\\\mathbf{R}) = \\\\frac{q_\\\\mathrm{tot}}{4\\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0 R}\\\\qquad\\\\hbox{with}\\\\quad q_\\\\mathrm{tot}\\\\equiv\\\\sum_{i=1}^N q_i. This is in fact Coulomb's law again. For the term we introduce : \\\\mathbf{R} = (R_x, R_y, R_z),\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{P} = (P_x, P_y, P_z)\\\\quad \\\\hbox{with}\\\\quad P_\\\\alpha \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{i=1}^N q_i r_{i\\\\alpha}, \\\\quad \\\\alpha=x,y,z. Then : V_{\\\\ell=1}(\\\\mathbf{R}) = \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0 R^3} (R_x P_x +R_y P_y + R_z P_z) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{R}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{P} }{4\\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0 R^3} = \\\\frac{\\\\hat{R}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{P} }{4\\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0 R^2}. This term is identical to the one found in Cartesian form. In order to write the term, we have to introduce shorthand notations for the five real components of the quadrupole moment and the real spherical harmonics. Notations of the type : Q_{z^2} \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{i=1}^N q_i\\\\; \\\\frac{1}{2}(3z_i^2 - r_i^2), can be found in the literature. Clearly the real notation becomes awkward very soon, exhibiting the usefulness of the complex notation. ==Interaction of two non- overlapping charge distributions== Consider two sets of point charges, one set {qi} clustered around a point A and one set {qj} clustered around a point B. Think for example of two molecules, and recall that a molecule by definition consists of electrons (negative point charges) and nuclei (positive point charges). The total electrostatic interaction energy UAB between the two distributions is : U_{AB} = \\\\sum_{i\\\\in A} \\\\sum_{j\\\\in B} \\\\frac{q_i q_j}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0 r_{ij}}. This energy can be expanded in a power series in the inverse distance of A and B. This expansion is known as the multipole expansion of UAB. In order to derive this multipole expansion, we write , which is a vector pointing from X towards Y. Note that : \\\\mathbf{R}_{AB}+\\\\mathbf{r}_{Bj}+\\\\mathbf{r}_{ji}+\\\\mathbf{r}_{iA} = 0 \\\\quad\\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{r}_{ij} = \\\\mathbf{R}_{AB}-\\\\mathbf{r}_{Ai}+\\\\mathbf{r}_{Bj} . We assume that the two distributions do not overlap: : \\\\mathbf{R}_{AB} > \\\\mathbf{r}_{Bj}-\\\\mathbf{r}_{Ai} \\\\quad\\\\text{for all } i,j. Under this condition we may apply the Laplace expansion in the following form : \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathbf{r}_{j}-\\\\mathbf{r}_i} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathbf{R}_{AB} - (\\\\mathbf{r}_{Ai}- \\\\mathbf{r}_{Bj}) } = \\\\sum_{L=0}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{M=-L}^L \\\\, (-1)^M I_L^{-M}(\\\\mathbf{R}_{AB})\\\\; R^M_L( \\\\mathbf{r}_{Ai}-\\\\mathbf{r}_{Bj}), where I^M_L and R^M_L are irregular and regular solid harmonics, respectively. The translation of the regular solid harmonic gives a finite expansion, : R^M_L(\\\\mathbf{r}_{Ai}-\\\\mathbf{r}_{Bj}) = \\\\sum_{\\\\ell_A=0}^L (-1)^{L-\\\\ell_A} \\\\binom{2L}{2\\\\ell_A}^{1/2} :: \\\\times \\\\sum_{m_A=-\\\\ell_A}^{\\\\ell_A} R^{m_A}_{\\\\ell_A}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{Ai}) R^{M-m_A}_{L-\\\\ell_A}(\\\\mathbf{r}_{Bj})\\\\; \\\\langle \\\\ell_A, m_A; L-\\\\ell_A, M-m_A\\\\mid L M \\\\rangle, where the quantity between pointed brackets is a Clebsch‚ÄìGordan coefficient. Further we used : R^{m}_{\\\\ell}(-\\\\mathbf{r}) = (-1)^{\\\\ell} R^{m}_{\\\\ell}(\\\\mathbf{r}) . Use of the definition of spherical multipoles Q and covering of the summation ranges in a somewhat different order (which is only allowed for an infinite range of L) gives finally : \\\\begin{align} U_{AB} = {} & \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0} \\\\sum_{\\\\ell_A=0}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{\\\\ell_B=0}^\\\\infty (-1)^{\\\\ell_B} \\\\binom{2\\\\ell_A+2\\\\ell_B}{2\\\\ell_A}^{1/2} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] & \\\\times \\\\sum_{m_A=-\\\\ell_A}^{\\\\ell_A} \\\\sum_{m_B=-\\\\ell_B}^{\\\\ell_B}(-1)^{m_A+m_B} I_{\\\\ell_A+\\\\ell_B}^{-m_A-m_B}(\\\\mathbf{R}_{AB})\\\\; Q^{m_A}_{\\\\ell_A} Q^{m_B}_{\\\\ell_B}\\\\; \\\\langle \\\\ell_A, m_A; \\\\ell_B, m_B\\\\mid \\\\ell_A+\\\\ell_B, m_A+m_B \\\\rangle. \\\\end{align} This is the multipole expansion of the interaction energy of two non-overlapping charge distributions which are a distance RAB apart. Since : I_{\\\\ell_A+\\\\ell_B}^{-(m_A+m_B)}(\\\\mathbf{R}_{AB}) \\\\equiv \\\\left[\\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{2\\\\ell_A+2\\\\ell_B+1}\\\\right]^{1/2}\\\\; \\\\frac{Y^{-(m_A+m_B)}_{\\\\ell_A+\\\\ell_B}\\\\left(\\\\widehat{\\\\mathbf{R}}_{AB}\\\\right)}{R^{\\\\ell_A+\\\\ell_B+1}_{AB}} this expansion is manifestly in powers of 1/RAB. The function Yml is a normalized spherical harmonic. ===Molecular moments=== All atoms and molecules (except S-state atoms) have one or more non-vanishing permanent multipole moments. Different definitions can be found in the literature, but the following definition in spherical form has the advantage that it is contained in one general equation. Because it is in complex form it has as the further advantage that it is easier to manipulate in calculations than its real counterpart. We consider a molecule consisting of N particles (electrons and nuclei) with charges eZi. (Electrons have a Z-value of -1, for nuclei it is the atomic number). Particle i has spherical polar coordinates ri, Œ∏i, and œÜi and Cartesian coordinates xi, yi, and zi. The (complex) electrostatic multipole operator is : Q^m_\\\\ell \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{i=1}^N e Z_i \\\\; R^m_{\\\\ell}(\\\\mathbf{r}_i), where R^m_{\\\\ell}(\\\\mathbf{r}_i) is a regular solid harmonic function in Racah's normalization (also known as Schmidt's semi- normalization). If the molecule has total normalized wave function Œ® (depending on the coordinates of electrons and nuclei), then the multipole moment of order \\\\ell of the molecule is given by the expectation (expected) value: : M^m_\\\\ell \\\\equiv \\\\langle \\\\Psi \\\\mid Q^m_\\\\ell \\\\mid \\\\Psi \\\\rangle. If the molecule has certain point group symmetry, then this is reflected in the wave function: Œ® transforms according to a certain irreducible representation Œª of the group (\\"Œ® has symmetry type Œª\\"). This has the consequence that selection rules hold for the expectation value of the multipole operator, or in other words, that the expectation value may vanish because of symmetry. A well-known example of this is the fact that molecules with an inversion center do not carry a dipole (the expectation values of Q^m_1 vanish for . For a molecule without symmetry, no selection rules are operative and such a molecule will have non-vanishing multipoles of any order (it will carry a dipole and simultaneously a quadrupole, octupole, hexadecapole, etc.). The lowest explicit forms of the regular solid harmonics (with the Condon-Shortley phase) give: : M^0_0 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N e Z_i, (the total charge of the molecule). The (complex) dipole components are: : M^1_1 = - \\\\sqrt{\\\\tfrac{1}{2}} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N e Z_i \\\\langle \\\\Psi  x_i+iy_i  \\\\Psi \\\\rangle\\\\quad \\\\hbox{and} \\\\quad M^{-1}_{1} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\tfrac{1}{2}} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N e Z_i \\\\langle \\\\Psi  x_i - iy_i  \\\\Psi \\\\rangle. : M^0_1 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N e Z_i \\\\langle \\\\Psi  z_i  \\\\Psi \\\\rangle. Note that by a simple linear combination one can transform the complex multipole operators to real ones. The real multipole operators are of cosine type C^m_\\\\ell or sine type S^m_\\\\ell. A few of the lowest ones are: : \\\\begin{align} C^0_1 &= \\\\sum_{i=1}^N eZ_i \\\\; z_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ C^1_1 &= \\\\sum_{i=1}^N eZ_i \\\\;x_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ S^1_1 &= \\\\sum_{i=1}^N eZ_i \\\\;y_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ C^0_2 &= \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N eZ_i\\\\; (3z_i^2-r_i^2)\\\\\\\\\\\\ C^1_2 &= \\\\sqrt{3}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N eZ_i\\\\; z_i x_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ C^2_2 &= \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N eZ_i\\\\; (x_i^2-y_i^2) \\\\\\\\\\\\ S^1_2 &= \\\\sqrt{3}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N eZ_i\\\\; z_i y_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ S^2_2 &= \\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N eZ_i\\\\; x_iy_i \\\\end{align} ====Note on conventions==== The definition of the complex molecular multipole moment given above is the complex conjugate of the definition given in this article, which follows the definition of the standard textbook on classical electrodynamics by Jackson, except for the normalization. Moreover, in the classical definition of Jackson the equivalent of the N-particle quantum mechanical expectation value is an integral over a one-particle charge distribution. Remember that in the case of a one-particle quantum mechanical system the expectation value is nothing but an integral over the charge distribution (modulus of wavefunction squared), so that the definition of this article is a quantum mechanical N-particle generalization of Jackson's definition. The definition in this article agrees with, among others, the one of Fano and RacahU. Fano and G. Racah, Irreducible Tensorial Sets, Academic Press, New York (1959). p. 31 and Brink and Satchler.D. M. Brink and G. R. Satchler, Angular Momentum, 2nd edition, Clarendon Press, Oxford, UK (1968). p. 64. See also footnote on p. 90. ==Examples== There are many types of multipole moments, since there are many types of potentials and many ways of approximating a potential by a series expansion, depending on the coordinates and the symmetry of the charge distribution. The most common expansions include: * Axial multipole moments of a 1/R potential; * Spherical multipole moments of a 1/R potential; and * Cylindrical multipole moments of a potential Examples of 1/R potentials include the electric potential, the magnetic potential and the gravitational potential of point sources. An example of a potential is the electric potential of an infinite line charge. ==General mathematical properties== Multipole moments in mathematics and mathematical physics form an orthogonal basis for the decomposition of a function, based on the response of a field to point sources that are brought infinitely close to each other. These can be thought of as arranged in various geometrical shapes, or, in the sense of distribution theory, as directional derivatives. Multipole expansions are related to the underlying rotational symmetry of the physical laws and their associated differential equations. Even though the source terms (such as the masses, charges, or currents) may not be symmetrical, one can expand them in terms of irreducible representations of the rotational symmetry group, which leads to spherical harmonics and related sets of orthogonal functions. One uses the technique of separation of variables to extract the corresponding solutions for the radial dependencies. In practice, many fields can be well approximated with a finite number of multipole moments (although an infinite number may be required to reconstruct a field exactly). A typical application is to approximate the field of a localized charge distribution by its monopole and dipole terms. Problems solved once for a given order of multipole moment may be linearly combined to create a final approximate solution for a given source. ==See also== * Barnes‚ÄìHut simulation * Fast multipole method * Laplace expansion * Legendre polynomials * Quadrupole magnets are used in particle accelerators * Solid harmonics * Toroidal moment ==References== Category:Potential theory Category:Vector calculus ","title":"Multipole expansion"},{"id":"1425539","text":"Lux Radio Theatre, sometimes spelled Lux Radio Theater, a classic radio anthology series, was broadcast on the NBC Blue Network (1934‚Äì35) (owned by the National Broadcasting Company, later predecessor of American Broadcasting Company [ABC] in 1943‚Äì1945); CBS Radio network (Columbia Broadcasting System) (1935‚Äì54), and NBC Radio (1954‚Äì55). Initially, the series adapted Broadway plays during its first two seasons before it began adapting films. These hour- long radio programs were performed live before studio audiences. The series became the most popular dramatic anthology series on radio, broadcast for more than 20 years and continued on television as the Lux Video Theatre through most of the 1950s. The primary sponsor of the show was Unilever through its Lux Soap brand. Broadcasting from New York, the series premiered at 2:30 pm, October 14, 1934, on the NBC Blue Network with a production of Seventh Heaven starring Miriam Hopkins and John Boles in a full-hour adaptation of the 1922‚Äì24 Broadway production by Austin Strong. The host was the show's fictional producer, Douglass Garrick (portrayed by John Anthony). Doris Dagmar played another fictional character, Peggy Winthrop, who delivered the Lux commercials. Each show featured a scripted session with Garrick talking to the lead actors. Anthony appeared as Garrick from the premiere 1934 episode until June 30, 1935. Garrick was portrayed by Albert Hayes from July 29, 1935, to May 25, 1936, when the show moved to the West Coast.Audio Classics Archive Radio Logs: Lux Radio Theater Famed studio executive and film producer and director Cecil B. DeMille took over as the host on June 1, 1936, continuing until January 22, 1945. That initial episode with DeMille featured stars Marlene Dietrich and Clark Gable in The Legionnaire and the Lady. On several occasions, usually when he was out of town, he was temporarily replaced by various celebrities, including Leslie Howard and Edward Arnold. Lux Radio Theatre strove to feature as many of the original stars of the original stage and film productions as possible, usually paying them $5,000 an appearance. In 1936, when sponsor manufacturer Lever Brothers (who made Lux brand soap and detergent) moved the show from New York City to Hollywood, the program began to emphasize adaptations of films rather than plays. The first Lux film adaptation was The Legionnaire and the Lady, with Marlene Dietrich and Clark Gable, based on the film Morocco. That was followed by a Lux adaptation of The Thin Man, featuring the movie's actual stars, Myrna Loy and William Powell. ==Radio regulars== Cecil B. DeMille, host of Lux Radio Theatre (1936‚Äì1945) Though the show focused on film and its performers, several classic radio regulars appeared in Lux Radio Theatre productions. Jim and Marian Jordan, better known as Fibber McGee and Molly, appeared on the show twice and also built an episode of their own radio comedy series around one of those appearances. Their longtime costar, Arthur Q. Bryan (wisecracking Doc Gamble on Fibber McGee and Molly), made a few Lux appearances, as well. Bandleader Phil Harris, a longtime regular on Jack Benny's radio program and his wife Alice Faye, who became radio stars with their own comedy show in 1948, appeared in a Lux presentation. Fred Allen, Jack Benny (with and without his wife, Mary Livingstone), and George Burns and Gracie Allen were also among the other radio stars who were invited to do Lux presentations.Dunning, John. On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio. New York: Oxford University Press, 1998. . Lux Radio Theatre once presented an adaptation of the film version of a radio series, The Life of Riley, featuring William Bendix as the Brooklyn-born, California-transplanted, stumbling but bighearted aircraft worker he already made famous in the long-running radio series (and eventual television hit) of the same name. At least once, Lux Radio Theatre offered a presentation without any known performers; its adaptation of This Is the Army during World War II featured a cast of American soldiers. A famous urban legend claimed that actor Sonny Tufts was slated to appear as a guest alongside Joan Fontaine for a production of The Major and the Minor on Lux Radio Theatre. When Joseph Cotten read the names of the next week's cast, he supposedly said, with a mixture of shock and astonishment, that listeners would hear \\"that new, talented personality... Sonny Tufts?!\\" However, this never happened. The legend began as a fake segment on one of Kermit Schafer's popular \\"Bloopers\\" albums, which have been criticized for their recreations, fabrications, and lack of accuracy. In actuality, Tufts was introduced by Cotten on the radio series Suspense, but Cotten's introduction was perfectly normal.Snopes ==AFRA closed shop== A clash over closed shop union rulings favored by the American Federation of Radio Artists ended DeMille's term as host of Lux Radio Theatre. AFRA assessed members a dollar each to help back a campaign to enact closed-shop rulings in California. DeMille, an AFRA member but a stern opponent of closed shops, refused to pay because he believed it would nullify his opposition vote. When AFRA ruled those not paying faced suspension from the union, thus a ban from appearing on the air, DeMille was finished in radio (because he also refused to let anyone else pay the dollar for him). In his 1959 autobiography, DeMille alleged that a former member of the American Communist Party later confided to him that the party had consciously orchestrated these circumstances of his exclusion from radio, as they considered him to be one of their two foremost enemies in radio. ==Hosts== Lux Radio Theatre employed several hosts over the following year, eventually choosing William Keighley as the new permanent host, a post he held from late 1945 through 1952. After that, producer-director Irving Cummings hosted the program until it ended in 1955.TCM: Irving Cummings For its airings on the U.S. Armed Forces Radio Service (for which it was retitled Hollywood Radio Theater), the program was hosted by Don Wilson in the early 1950s. A studio audience gathers prior to a live production at Hollywood's CBS Radio Playhouse, located one block south of Hollywood and Vine at 1615 North Vine Street. During its years on CBS in Hollywood, Lux Radio Theatre was broadcast from the CBS Radio Playhouse at 1615 North Vine Street in Hollywood, one block south of the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Vine. The theater was owned by aviator, industrialist, and film producer Howard Hughes in the early 1930s. When it was purchased in 1954 by philanthropist Huntington Hartford, it was briefly called the Huntington Hartford Theater and then the Doolittle Theater. It is now the Ricardo Montalb√°n Theatre. == Notable stars == Many of leading names in stage and film appeared in the series, most in the roles they made famous on the screen, including Abbott and Costello, Lauren Bacall, Wallace Beery, Ingrid Bergman, Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, Ronald Colman, Joan Crawford, Bing Crosby, Bette Davis, Irene Dunne, Deanna Durbin, Henry Fonda, Ava Gardner, Judy Garland, Betty Grable, Cary Grant, Rita Hayworth, Katharine Hepburn, William Holden, Bob Hope, Betty Hutton, Gene Kelly, Hedy Lamarr, Carole Lombard, Jeanette MacDonald, Fredric March, Robert Mitchum, Dennis Morgan, Paul Muni, Laurence Olivier, Robert Preston, Tyrone Power, Edward G.

This brigade has the only airborne-qualified military police units in the U.S. Army, outside of the 82nd MP Company of the 82nd Airborne Division. It provides law enforcement and police duties to Fort Bragg, and for the XVIII Airborne Corps when deployed. As a brigade with organic airborne units, it is authorized a beret flash and parachute wing trimming, and the shoulder sleeve insignia was authorized to be worn with an airborne tab. According to U.S. Army's Institute of Heraldry, the shoulder sleeve insignia \\"was amended to delete the airborne tab effective 16 October 2008\\" when jump status of the brigade was terminated; however, various elements of the brigade remain on jump status. ==Insignia== Shoulder Insignia Description *On a dark green oblong arched at top and base a light green globe with dark green gridlines bearing a five pointed yellow star. Symbolism *Green and yellow are the colors used for Military Police, and a star is emblematic of that branch of service. A star also connotes leadership and authority.

The Group provided command, control, staff planning, and coordination for military police units assigned and attached to the I and II Corps Tactical Zones. The 93rd, 97th, and 504th Military Police Battalions were under its control. The unit participated in thirteen campaigns to include nine counteroffensives and two consolidations during the Vietnam War receiving two Meritorious Unit Commendations and the Republic Of Vietnam Cross Of Gallantry With Palm for their outstanding effort and dedication. ===Cold War Era=== On 16 July 1981 the group was reorganized and redesignated as the 16th Military Police Brigade (Airborne). Since Vietnam, the brigade headquarters has deployed around the world in support of XVIII Airborne Corps and on-going Army operations. In October 1983, the headquarters was sent to Grenada in support of Operation Urgent Fury. In March 1988, the brigade went to Panama in support of southern command's operation to secure US civilians and property and to protect the canal. In September 1989, the brigade was sent to Saint Croix in the US Virgin Islands to restore law and order and protect property following hurricane Hugo. In December 1989, the brigade again went to Panama this time in support of Operation Just Cause and Promote Liberty during which the brigade was instrumental in standing up the Panamanian police force.GlobalSecurity.org: 16th Military Police Brigade, GlobalSecurity.org. Retrieved 28 July 2008. in August 1990, the brigade deployed to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in support of operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The brigade was later recognized for its hard work in the desert with their third Meritorious Unit Commendation. September 1992 the brigade went to Florida to assist in disaster relief following Hurricane Andrew. In September 1994, the brigade was sent to Haiti to support Operation Uphold Democracy. ===War on Terrorism=== In August 2006, the brigade deployed for 15 months to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom where they were responsible for detainee operations and convoy security at Camp Bucca, along with detainee operations at The Baghdad Correctional Facility (Camp Cropper). The Unit also worked with Task Force 131 at Camp Victory in Baghdad, Iraq. The brigade was awarded its fourth Meritorious Unit Commendation for the outstanding mission accomplishments in Iraq. The soldiers of the brigade have consistently been sent first to worldwide hot spots and crisis locations.

It is roughly centred on Bridge Road, a mile northeast of Wembley town centre and northwest from Charing Cross. The name Wembley Park refers to the area that, at its broadest, falls within the limits of a late 18th-century landscaped estate in northern Wembley in the historic Middlesex county. Part of this estate became the location of development in the 1890s after being sold to Edward Watkin and the Metropolitan Railway cutting through the area. Wembley Park was developed into a pleasure and events destination for urban Londoners, with a large fairground made there. It was later also a key area of the Metro- land suburban development in the 1920s - the same decade Empire Stadium was built and the British Empire Exhibition was held. Wembley Park continues to be a recreational centre today, being home to Wembley Stadium, England's primary football stadium and a major sports and entertainment venue; as well as Wembley Arena, a concert venue; among others. Today the area continues new retail and housing development schemes near the stadium complex that have started since the early 2000s. The Chalkhill housing estate is also located in the area. The east is home to large industrial land, called Stadium Industrial Estate, adjacent to Brent Park; whereas to its north lies Fryent Country Park and to its north-east the Welsh Harp. ==History== ===The Page family=== Wembley was in the parish of Harrow, and the manor of Wembley was a sub-manor of Harrow. It belonged to the Priory of Kilburn. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the Priory's lands in Wembley and Tokyngton came into the possession of Richard Page. The Page family, successful local farmers, had already been leasing the land before the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The Pages became one of the largest and richest families in Middlesex. During the first half of the 18th century, what is now Wembley Park consisted of agricultural land and a few farm buildings along the current Wembley Hill Road. One of these farms was called 'Wellers' a large red brick house with a blue slate roof, probably built after 1700. ===Richard Page and Humphry Repton=== Richard Page (died 1771) was the landowner and lord of the manor. He lived in Sudbury, west of Wembley. Around 1787, his son, also called Richard (1748‚Äì1803), had the ambition of converting 'Wellers' into a country seat, turning the fields around it into a landscaped estate. In 1792 Richard Page decided to employ the famous landscape architect Humphry Repton (1752‚Äì1818) to convert the farmland into wooded parkland and to make improvements to the house. Repton was clearly impressed by Page's property. He wrote, \\"in the vicinity of the metropolis there are few places so free from interruption as the grounds at Wembly; and, indeed, in the course of my experience, I have seen no spot within so short a distance of London more perfectly secluded ... Wembly is as quiet and retired at seven miles distance as it could be at seventy.\\" Later, writing to a friend in May 1793, Repton wrote of Wembley \\"on Wednesday I go to ... a most beautiful spot near Harrow. I wish I could shew it to you.\\" Repton often called the areas he landscaped 'parks', and so Wembley Park owes its name as well as its origins to Humphry Repton. The area landscaped by Repton was larger than the current Wembley Park. It included the southern slopes of Barn Hill to the north, where Repton planted trees and started building a 'prospect house' ‚Äì a gothic tower offering a view over the parkland. Repton may also have designed the thatched lodge that survives on Wembley Hill Road, to the west of Wembley Park. It is in a style frequently used by him, known as \\"cottage orne\\". Humphry Repton was in the habit of recording his designs in Red Books, but the one for Wembley Park, which would answer this speculation, has not survived. Richard Page lost interest in Wembley Park, partly because he had inherited a fully completed Capability Brown (1716‚Äì1783) landscape at Flambards in Harrow, so the house itself was never remodelled by Repton. The tower on Barn Hill was never finished either. It became known as \\"Page's folly\\" (as with the later example of Watkin's Tower) and was eventually demolished. ===John Gray=== The house appears to have been sold to John Gray (died 1828), a London brandy merchant, in 1802. The Page family retained the Barn Hill part of the park, some 91 acres (77 hectares). Gray renovated and extended the house between 1811 and 1814, at a cost of ¬£14,000. He may also be responsible for the late 18th- or early 19th- century cottage orn√© style lodge on Wembley Hill Road, if it was not built for Page by Repton. Whoever built it, it is thought to be the oldest property in Wembley. Even without the Barn Hill portion, the Wembley Park estate covered some 327 acres (132 hectares) from what is now Wembley Hill Road in the west to the River Brent in the east, and from the modern Chiltern Line in the south to Forty Lane in the north. The current Empire Way (originally Raglan Gardens) now bisects Repton's landscape. Wembley Park Mansion, now with stucco facing as part of Gray's improvements, (and so known locally as 'The White House'), was situated west of Empire Way, while much of the parkland was to the east. Wembley Park was described in 1834 as \\"beautifully diversified by fine grown timber judiciously placed, contributing a seclusion such as is scarcely elsewhere to be enjoyed, but at a considerable distance from the metropolis.\\" Later visitors described \\"a grove, a pleasant retreat in summer ‚Äì a scene of tranquility furnished with an old temple and a summerhouse\\" to the west of the house. In 1880 the Metropolitan Railway extended its line from Willesden Green to Harrow, cutting through Wembley Park. The railway company bought 47 acres (19 hectares) of land from Gray's son, also called John. He died in 1887. Two years later Wembley Park was bought by the Metropolitan Railway Company for ¬£32,500. Its chairman was Sir Edward Watkin (1819‚Äì1901). ===Watkin and Wembley Park=== A sketched plan of Wembley Park, featuring the major planned Watkin's Tower, c. 1894 Sir Edward Watkin, Chairman of the Metropolitan Railway Company, wanted Britain to have a bigger and better tower to rival the new Eiffel Tower in Paris. Watkin also hoped that this tower and an associated pleasure gardens would bring passengers to his Metropolitan Railway. Wembley Park, which was only 12 minutes by train from Baker Street, seemed the ideal location. The International (later Metropolitan) Tower Construction Company was formed to finance construction of the tower, with Watkin as chairman. It leased a significant part of Wembley Park from the Metropolitan Railway. The park became a sizeable pleasure garden that boasted cricket & football grounds, a large running track, tea pagodas, bandstands, a lake, a nine-hole golf course, a variety theatre and a trotting ring. Served by the new Wembley Park station, it officially opened in May 1894, though it had in fact been open on Saturdays since October 1893 to cater for football matches in the pleasure gardens. The tower design was chosen through a competition, judged in March 1890. The judges eventually awarded the 500 guinea prize to a design for a 1,200-foot steel tower by Stewart, MacLaren and Dunn. Originally intended to have eight legs, the plan was changed to a cheaper four-legged design and the height reduced to 1,150 foot. There were to be two stages, one 155 feet up and another at the halfway mark, with a viewing area at the summit. The platforms would be fitted with \\"restaurants, theatre, shops, Turkish baths, promenades and winter gardens.\\" The foundations were laid in 1892 and Watkin's Tower opened in 1896. Over 100,000 people visited Wembley Park in the second quarter of 1894, though this declined to 120,000 for the whole of 1895 and only 100,000 for 1896. Despite an initial burst of popularity, the tower failed to draw large crowds. Of the 100,000 visitors to the Park in 1896 rather less than a fifth paid to go up the Tower. In 1902 the Tower, now known as ‚ÄòWatkin's Folly‚Äô, was declared unsafe and closed to the public. In 1904 it was decided to demolish the structure, a process that ended with the foundations being destroyed by explosives in 1907, leaving four large holes in the ground. The loss of the tower did not diminish the park‚Äôs appeal as a public recreation ground, and it continued to offer football, cricket, cycling, rowing, athletics and in winter, ice skating on the frozen lake. After 1907 the Variety Hall in the park was used as a film studio by the Walturdaw Company Limited, founded by E.G. Turner. An 18-hole golf course was opened in 1912, and by the end of the First World War over 100 sports clubs were using the park. After 1889, the Metropolitan Railway built roads to the south-west of Wembley Park tube station, on that part of Wembley Park not allocated to the pleasure gardens or the Metropolitan track itself. In 1908, Wembley Park Mansion was demolished to allow construction of the new Manor Drive. The house had been a convent from 1905, housing French nuns fleeing the Third Republic's separation of Church and State. In 1906 the Great Central Railway opened a line and several stations between Neasden and Northolt Junction (today South Ruislip), where it connected with the newly built Great Western & Great Central Joint Line. The Great Central‚Äôs southernmost station on this short line (and so its southernmost station anywhere, other than its terminus at Marylebone) was Wembley Hill, just south of the Wembley Park pleasure gardens. ===The British Empire Exhibition=== The Palace of Engineering at the British Empire Exhibition, 1924 In 1921 the British Government decided to site the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Park, on the site of Edward Watkin's pleasure gardens. The Urban District Council was opposed to the Exhibition, but its objections were overruled. Wembley Stadium (then the Empire Stadium) was built for the Exhibition and, famously, the 1923 FA Cup Final was played there. Much of Humphry Repton's Wembley Park landscape was transformed in 1922‚Äì1923 during preparations for the Exhibition. In addition to the pavilions and kiosks there were a lake, a funfair, a garden and a working replica coal mine. There were also numerous restaurants, the most expensive of which was the Lucullus restaurant (in 1925 the Wembley Garden Club restaurant) near the exhibition gardens. In 1924 J. Lyons held a monopoly of catering, but the restaurant in the Indian Pavilion used Indian cooks and was advised by Edward Palmer \\"of Messrs. Veeraswami [sic] & Co.\\" to serve as \\"Indian Adviser at the restaurant\\". In 1925 Veeraswamy & Co. ran the Indian restaurant, even though, for reasons both economic and political, the Indian Government did not take part in the 1925 season. Veeraswamy & Co. later founded the first Indian restaurant aimed at a non-Anglo-Indian white clientele in England, in Regent Street. It still survives, and was awarded a Michelin star in 2016. The British Empire Exhibition ran from 1924 to 1925, and while it failed to make a profit or reinforce conclusively the national attachment to the ideal of the British Empire, it did make Wembley a household name. Arthur Elvin's rescue of the Empire Stadium building then ensured that this continued, and that Wembley Park would remain the pre-eminent visitor attraction in west London, even though much of the Exhibition site was taken over by light engineering. ===Inter-war suburban development and ‚ÄòMetroland‚Äô=== A few large houses had been built on parts of Wembley Park, south-west of Wembley Park tube station, as early as the 1890s. In 1906, when Watkin‚Äôs Tower closed, the Tower Company had become the Wembley Park Estate Company (later Wembley Ltd.), with the aim of developing Wembley as a residential suburb. Unlike other railways, from an early date the Metropolitan Railway had bought land alongside its line and then developed housing on it. In the 1880s and 1890s it had developed the Willesden Park Estate near Willesden Green station, and in the early 1900s it developed land in Pinner, as well as planning the development of Wembley Park. In 1915 the Metropolitan Railway‚Äôs publicity department created the term ‚ÄòMetro-land‚Äô and gave the name to the company's annual guide. The 1924 Metro- land guide describes Wembley Park as \\"rapidly developed of recent years as a residential district\\", pointing out that there are several golf courses within a few minutes journey of it. One of the earliest Metroland developments was a 123-acre one at Chalkhill, within the curtilage of Humphry Repton‚Äôs Wembley Park. Metropolitan Railway Country Estates acquired the land shortly after it was created and began selling plots in 1921. The railway even put in a siding to bring building materials to the estate. The British Empire Exhibition further encouraged suburban development and could be said to have put Wembley on the map once again as a desirable location. Wembley‚Äôs sewerage was improved, many roads in the area were straightened and widened and new bus services began operating. Visitors were introduced to Wembley and some later moved to the area when houses had been built to accommodate them. Between 1921 and 1928 season ticket sales at Wembley Park and neighbouring Metropolitan stations rose by over 700%. Like much of the rest of West London, most of Wembley Park and its environs was built over, largely with relatively low- density suburban housing, by 1939. This population was served by a new 1,500 seater cinema, the Elite, later (from 1930) Capitol, which opened on 21 March 1928. The cinema was situated in the British Empire Exhibition's former conference hall on Raglan Gardens (today Empire Way). === Film and television studios === In 1926 British Talking Pictures opened The Wembley Park Studios in what had been the British Empire Exhibition‚Äôs fine dining restaurant. When rebuilt in the late 1920s, Wembley Studios would become Britain's first purpose-built sound stages, though it was seriously damaged in a fire in October 1929, not long after it had opened. Perhaps due to the fire, the studio was never as successful as envisaged. It was taken over by Twentieth Century Fox to make 'quota-quickies', and then went into decline during and after the Second World War. In 1955 Wembley Film Studio was taken over by Associated-Rediffusion, ITV‚Äôs weekday broadcasters for London. Rediffusion added a new ¬£1,000,000 television studio, which at the time was the largest in Europe. The Beatles performed there several times, notably on 28 April 1964. In 1968 Rediffusion lost its franchise. London Weekend Television continued to use the studio, but it went into decline until it was taken over by Fountain Studios in 1993. In 2016 Avesco, Fountain Studio‚Äôs owner, took the decision to sell the studios to Quintain after reporting financial losses in the previous year. In May 2018, it was announced that the studios would open in the latter half of 2018 as a flexible 1,000‚Äì2,000 seat theatre by Troubador Theatres (the same company that owns Wembley Park Theatre Ltd) as well as bar and restaurant. This theatre opened as Troubadour Wembley Park Theatre in Summer 2019. === The Empire Pool === Inside the Empire Pool in 1938 In 1932 Arthur Elvin, who had saved the stadium in the 1920s, developed an interest in hosting Ice hockey. He decided to build an indoor Olympic-sized swimming pool that could be converted into an ice rink. It would also provide the venue for the swimming events at the 2nd Empire Games, which were held in 1934. The building, called the Empire Pool, was designed by the engineer Owen Williams. Williams built a unique concrete structure, which opened on 25 July 1934. It is now called The SSE Arena. The building served as a public swimming pool until the start of the Second World War. It was last used for swimming when it hosted the aquatic events at the 1948 Olympics. Numerous sporting and entertainment events have been held there over the years, ranging from basketball to pantomimes on ice. From 1959, and especially from the late 1960s onwards, The SSE Arena has become increasingly associated with popular music, hosting every major artist from the Beatles to the Stones, Bowie to Madonna. === Wembley Town Hall === The former Brent Town Hall Between 1937 and 1940 Wembley Borough Council built their new town hall in Kingsbury within the boundaries of Repton's original Wembley Park. It was designed by Clifford Strange and is described by Pevsner as \\"the best of the modern town halls around London, neither fanciful nor drab.\\" In 1964 the new London Borough of Brent took over the town hall. It remained the headquarters of Brent until the new Brent Civic Centre, also in Wembley Park, opened in 2013. The Wembley Town Hall building re-opened as the Lyc√©e International de Londres Winston Churchill, in September 2015. The refurbishment preserves many elements of the original design. === The Second World War === During the Second World War the Government initially banned large public events, but later realised that this had a demoralising effect. Sporting events, including football matches, returned to Wembley, although for a while after Dunkirk the Stadium became an Emergency Dispersal Centre, and later housed refugees from occupied countries. The Empire Pool was used as a permanent hostel for evacuated Gibraltarians, with its extensive windows blacked out. Arthur Elvin offered free admission to servicemen and servicewomen, and helped war charities. Unofficial cup finals were held in the Stadium, as well as internationals against the home nations, and greyhound racing returned, albeit only in daylight hours, while Canadian troops invigorated ice hockey. The Stadium was too large to conceal, and German aircraft used it to identify their location. They also dropped bombs on Wembley Park. At least two fell on the former British Empire Exhibition site, one fell very near Wembley Park station, and several fell on the suburban housing to the west of Empire Way. Light industry in Wembley Park helped the war effort, but the low concentration of bombs here compared to Tokyngton just south of it, suggests that it was not seriously targeted by the Luftwaffe. In 1944, a V1 flying bomb fell onto the greyhound kennels. Two dogs were casualties and about 60 escaped onto the streets of Wembley. An unexploded 50 kg bomb was uncovered during redevelopment work in May 2015. On 13 May 1945 the end of the War in Europe was marked by a Thanksgiving Service in Wembley Stadium, followed by a Victory Review and Commemoration Service in the same venue on 17 June. On 26 May 1945, England played their first Wembley International against a non-British side, drawing 2-2 with France in front of 65,000 spectators. By the end of the war more than one million service personnel had visited Wembley, as well as many civilians. === The 1948 Olympics === The Olympic Torch arriving at Empire Stadium in the 1948 Summer Olympics In March 1946, still recovering from the war, Britain put itself forward to host the Olympic Games for the second time in its history, seeing an opportunity to stage-manage an unparalleled global event and to demonstrate to the world that the worst effects of the war were in the past. There was limited preparation time. It was debated whether a sports festival was really necessary at such a time, but it was generally agreed that it could only bring an element of light relief and a wider image of progress, to which other nations could easily relate. Arthur Elvin supplied the Wembley site free of charge. Apart from the Stadium and Empire Pool, some of the old British Empire Exhibition buildings were used, notably the Palace of Engineering, so that no new venues were needed. Olympic Way was built at a cost of ¬£120,000, using German POW labour. Wembley's sports facilities had survived the war in good condition and were considered adequate for Olympic competition. Wembley Stadium hosted the opening ceremonies, the track-and-field competition, and other events. A cinder track, made with residue from the domestic fires of Leicester, was laid inside the stadium. Food rationing was still in force, but other competing nations, such as The Netherlands, contributed provisions. Athletes were provided with increased rations of 5,500 calories a day, on a par with the ration of a docker or a miner. The Games were on the least lavish scale ever seen, costing just ¬£730,000 to put together. They became known as the Austerity Games. Many British athletes commuted to the Games on public transport. Even the \\"gold\\" medals were made from oxidised silver. However, each national team was assigned a vehicle with a uniformed female driver. The games opened at 4.00 p.m. (the time shown on Big Ben on the promotional literature) on 29 July 1948. There were 80,000 spectators on the first day. Though the 1936 Berlin Olympics had been televised, the Wembley games were the first Olympics to be broadcast by BBC television. Few people owned a television set, but nonetheless, the new medium helped to promote the Games in a way never seen before by the British public. The Empire Pool had never been a great success as a swimming venue, but it was ideal for the Olympics. For the first time at the Olympics, swimming events were held under cover. As the Empire Pool was longer than the standard Olympic length of 50 metres, a platform was constructed across the pool which both shortened it and could house officials. The Empire Pool also hosted the boxing and the diving, as it had at the Empire Games in 1934. In the stadium, some poor weather, and the inferior quality of the running track, slowed the track-and-field competition times. The fewest Olympic records were set in the history of the Games thus far, although the restricted women's competition was expanded to 10 possible events with the addition of the 200-metre run, the long jump, and the shot put. British Guiana (now Guyana), Burma (now Myanmar), Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Iran, Iraq, Jamaica, Korea, Lebanon, Pakistan, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela were all nations sending teams for the first time. The 1948 Games were the first international competition that the Philippines, India and Pakistan officially entered as independent nations. As a team, India won their first medal as an independent nation in the field hockey competition. They were awarded the gold (also their first ever Olympic victory) when they beat Britain 4-0 in the final. Germany and Japan were not invited to the Games due to their roles as the aggressors in World War II. The Soviet Union was invited, but they declined. The Games were, however, attended by other Communist bloc countries, including Hungary, Yugoslavia and Poland. A total of 4,104 athletes took part, from a record number of 59 nations (90% of all competitors were male). This compares with 10,000 athletes from 204 nations at the 2012 London games. A number of events made their Olympic debut at Wembley in 1948, including the women's 200 metres, long jump and shot put. The most successful individual athlete at these Games was Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands, known as \\"The Flying Housewife\\". A 30-year-old mother of three, whom many believed was too old to compete, she was pregnant at the time she won four gold medals: in the 100 metres, 200 metres, 80 metres high hurdles, and 4 x 100 metre relay. She was also a world record holder in the long jump and high jump and might have won further medals in these sports, but female athletes were limited to three individual events. Well over a million people attended across all the Olympic events at Wembley Park. Britain finished with a total of 20 medals, three of them gold, coming 12th in the medal table. The USA walked away with the top spot, as their medal tally reached 84, including 34 golds. === The Stadium and Empire Pool after the Second World War === Speedway returned to the Stadium in 1946. The late 1940s was the sport‚Äôs heyday. The Wembley Lions supporters Club had 61,000 members in 1948, and one meeting attracted a crowd of 85,000, with a further 20,000 listening to the results on the radio outside. Speedway ended at Wembley in 1957, unless one counts a brief revival in 1970‚Äì71. The post-war years also saw religious events at the Stadium (a Roman Catholic celebration in 1950, a gathering of Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses in 1951 and Billy Graham‚Äôs Greater London Crusade in 1954), as well as women‚Äôs hockey. American football was first played in 1952, but would not really become a Wembley staple until the 1980s. Wembley remained primarily famous for football. The 1953 FA Cup Final became known as ‚Äòthe Matthew‚Äôs final‚Äô, because 38-year old Blackpool outside-right Stanley Matthews finally got the FA Cup Winners medal his skills so clearly deserved, though the hat-trick of goals that brought Blackpool victory was scored by Stan Mortensen. Floodlights were installed in the Stadium in 1955. Throughout the late 1940s and 1950s the Empire Pool continued to be dominated by Ice hockey, skating, boxing and tennis. New events were introduced after the war, however, including a meeting of the Women‚Äôs League of Health and Beauty (1946), darts (1948), the All American Roller Skating Show (also known as Skating Vanities of 1949), pantomimes on ice (the first being Dick Whittington on Ice, in 1951) and swimming spectacles devised by Hollywood stars Buster Crabbe and Esther Williams. These last had to use temporary structures to retain water, as the swimming pool itself was no longer usable. International basketball had been played in the Pool before the warm but it now became a regular feature, starring the Harlem Globetrotters, who would perform at Wembley from 1950 until 1982. Most importantly, two popular music concerts intended to raise money for Vera Lynn‚Äôs SOS charity were held in 1959. These were the Record Star Show in March, and the Starlight Dance on 17 October. 9,000 people attended the Record Star Show, and the Starlight Dance was equally successful. The discovery that popular music events attracted large, new audiences would radically change the Empire Pool‚Äôs offer in the decades to come. More new events came to the Stadium and the Empire Pool in the 1960s, including ski-jumping in the Stadium, with a specially constructed tower and machine-produced snow. In 1963 the Stadium was given a new roof, ostensibly protecting all spectators. On 18 June in the same year, Henry Cooper fought Cassius Clay (Mohammed Ali) in the Stadium, a change from holding boxing matches in the Pool. === The 1966 World Cup === The 1966 World Cup kicked off at Wembley on Monday, 11 July 1966, with a match between England and Uruguay. It was a dull 0 - 0 draw. The other two teams who played at Wembley in the group stage were Mexico and France. In 1966, however, the World Cup competition was clearly not seen as being as important is it is now. Wembley Stadium refused to cancel a greyhound meeting on 15 July that clashed with Uruguay v. France, meaning that the match had to be played at White City. Having opened with a mediocre performance, Alf Ramsey's England went on to beat both Mexico and France in the group stage. They then beat Argentina 1-0 in the quarter finals and Portugal 2-1 in the semi-finals, both matches being played at Wembley. The final was played at Wembley on Wednesday 30 July 1966. England wore red because they had lost the toss of a coin to determine which team would have to wear their away colours. Haller scored for Germany in the 13th minute, with Hurst equalising in the 19th. Peters scored for England in the 78th minute, but Weber made it level just before the end of normal time. What happened in extra time is the stuff of legends. Geoff Hurst scored a controversial, and in retrospect, wrongly allowed, goal in the 101st minute, and then a further goal in the 120th (119' 51\\"), just as the match was ending. \\"Some people are on the pitch‚Ä¶ they think it's all over\\", said BBC commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme, adding \\"it is now\\" as Hurst's ball hit the back of the net. Less than two years later there was another famous English footballing victory at Wembley. On 29 May 1968 Wembley hosted the first of seven European Cup finals that have been played there so far (five in the old Stadium and two in the new one). Manchester United defeated SL Benfica 4‚Äì1 in front of a crowd of 92,225 people. === The growth of popular music at Wembley === The former Wembley Stadium Bowl, c. 1965 Inspired by the success of the 1959 popular music shows, the NME moved the Pollwinners Concert to the Empire Pool in February 1960. These concerts would continue there until 1973. The Pop Hit Parade Concerts, the ATV Glad Rag Ball, the Ready Steady Go Mod Ball (1964) and more Record Star shows all followed, some of them televised. Since all the major stars of the era, ranging from Billy Fury to Status Quo, played at these events, the Pool quickly became associated with popular music. The Beatles made their last official live appearance in Britain at the NME Annual Poll- Winners' All-Star Concert at the Pool on 1 May 1966. Although the concert was televised, the cameras were switched off while the Beatles played because Brian Epstein and ABC TV had failed to agree over terms. They were filmed receiving their awards, however. From 30 June to 2 July 1967 The Monkees played the Empire Pool. They were the first group to headline on their own. Many others would follow. On 13 July 1969 the band Yes performed at Wembley Stadium, on a bill that also included Alan Price, Don Partridge (aka \\"the King of the Buskers\\") and Status Quo, who would be the first act to open Live Aid, on exactly the same date 16 years later. This was the first popular music concert in the Stadium On 5 August 1972 a pop concert called The London Rock and Roll Show was held in the Stadium. It was the first of several popular music concerts held in the Stadium in the ‚Äò70s. Crosby Stills Nash & Young followed on 14 September 1974, and The Who, along with AC/DC and The Stranglers, on 18 August 1979. At the same time, the Empire Pool really took off as a concert venue. Promoters realised that it had a significantly larger capacity than even the Albert Hall. On 21 November 1971 Led Zeppelin‚Äôs Electric Magic Show became the first spectacular, theatrical rock concert at the Empire Pool. In the 1980s Wembley Arena became increasingly known for the use of lasers at concerts. Pink Floyd and Genesis were the best exponents of this style. ===Wembley Complex=== In the 1970s Wembley Park became known as Wembley Complex, a group of venues serving different needs. The Complex included Wembley Stadium and the Empire Pool (renamed Wembley Arena on 1 February 1978), as well as new buildings, including the Esso Motor Hotel (opened 1972) and Wembley Conference Centre (opened 31 January 1977), Wembley Exhibition Centre (opened 1977), the 722m2 Greenwich Rooms and a futuristic triangular office block called Elvin House. The redevelopment scheme cost ¬£15 million and was designed by R. Seifert & Partners, with Douglas Kershaw and Co. acting as consultant surveyors. Planning consent was given prior to 26 September 1972, after seeking guidance from the Greater London Council, the London Borough of Brent and the Metropolitan Police. The development included two pedestrian walkways (pedways), allowing people entering and leaving the Stadium to be segregated from the vehicular traffic. The main walkway, which led to Olympic Way, and is still in existence, was 60 feet wide, while another lead to other leading to Empire Way via Elvin House, was 30 feet wide. The Stadium authorities had long been aware of the need for traffic and pedestrian segregation. The main pedway opened in 1975. It has been written, in a 1999 Heritage Study connected with the construction of the new Stadium, that the pedway compromised the north frontage of the 1923 Stadium by obscuring portions of it. Wembley Hill station was called Wembley Complex from May 1978 to May 1987, when it became Wembley Stadium. In the early 1990s two further exhibition halls were built, offering 17,000m2 of space in all. === Papal visit. 1982 === The first open-air mass held during Pope John Paul II's visit to Britain in 1982 was held at Wembley Stadium, on Saturday 29 May. About 80,000 people were present. Archbishop of Westminster Cardinal Basil Hume said that the Stadium had become a church. === Live Aid, 1985 === On 13 July 1985 the Stadium was the venue for an enormous 16-hour charity rock concert, largely the brain-child of Irish singer Bob Geldof, in partnership with Midge Ure from Ultravox. Shocked by the famine in Ethiopia, Geldof had created Band Aid, which had released the single Do They Know It‚Äôs Christmas/Feed The World in late 1984. Now he had helped arrange a live charity event on an as yet unheard-of scale. As Geldof later said \\"Wembley had to be the centrepiece: for the thing to have any authority it had to be staged at Wembley.\\" It was held simultaneously with John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, USA. Despite organisational problems the event was a huge success. Over 70,000 saw it live, and a further 1.9 billion watched on television, worldwide. ¬£30 million was raised for famine relief. It was a hot day, and Wembley staff had to distribute water, hose down the crowd and even cut off the legs from people‚Äôs jeans to convert them into shorts. Geldof and his band, The Boomtown Rats, had never played at Wembley before, and were astonished by the noise. The Arena and the Conference Centre and exhibition halls also played their part, being taken over to provide dressing rooms for the performers. According to Charlie Shun, a Wembley sales manager, Live Aid was \\"the event which established Wembley [Stadium] as a major rock venue. We had only staged ten different music shows at the stadium before Live Aid but after that it all took off.\\" === Nelson Mandela === On 11 June 1988 a concert was held celebrating the 70th birthday of Nelson Mandela, then a political prisoner. Nearly two years later, on 16 April 1990, only two months after his release, Mandela was present at another Wembley Stadium concert - Nelson Mandela: An International Tribute for a Free South Africa. === Euro '96 === In 1996 England hosted the European Championships for the first time. As in 1966, the opening match, England v. Switzerland, took place at Wembley. Played on 8 June 1996, it was a 1 ‚Äì 1 draw. England topped their group, and won a quarter final against Spain. This was Wembley's first international penalty shoot-out. The England supporters sang the catchy Euro '96 anthem, Football's Coming Home, but on the following Wednesday, 26 June 1996, in Wembley's second international penalty shoot-out, Germany beat England 6 ‚Äì 5. Germany went on to beat the Czech Republic 2 ‚Äì 1 in the final. Wembley Park station was also partially refurbished for Euro '96. === Construction of new stadium === The fountains at The SSE Arena following its refurbishment in 2006 By the 1990s, the 1923 stadium was becoming increasingly outdated. As Conservative MP Andrew Bingham later said in a House of Commons debate on football governance, \\"I remember going to the last game at the old Wembley stadium and thinking how old and archaic it looked compared with the new and modern grounds.\\" The Stadium closed in October 2000 and was demolished in 2003. While Wembley was being rebuilt the FA cup finals were played at Cardiff‚Äôs Millennium Stadium. A new Wembley stadium was designed by a consortium including engineering consultant Mott MacDonald and built by the Australian firm Multiplex. It cost ¬£798 million. The new Stadium opened on 17 March 2007 with a Community Day for London Borough of Brent residents. English alternative rock band Muse became the first popular musicians to perform in the new Stadium, on 16 June 2007. This, their HAARP tour, was voted Wembley‚Äôs Greatest Event in 2011. === Narendra Modi visit, 2015 === On 13 November 2015, during a state visit to the United Kingdom, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a rally at the new Wembley Stadium. 60,000 people, mostly British Indians, attended. ==Redevelopment== The Palace of Industry in 2007, before demolition Brent Civic Centre under construction, 2012 Wembley Park Boulevard was built along with the London Designer Outlet next to the Stadium and the SSE Arena New built buildings in Olympic Way, in 2018 Mass re-development has occurred in the complex area since the start of the 21st century. The old Wembley Stadium was demolished in 2003 and rebuilt, followed by new developments nearby that continue until the present day. The plans for the redevelopment were approved by the council in June 2004, which envisioned a plan to turn it into \\"north London's Croydon\\". Chalkhill estate was already renovated before, in the 1990s. The remaining portions of the British Empire Exhibition's Palace of Arts were demolished in 2006. The only surviving Exhibition structure, the Palace of Industry, was finally demolished in February‚ÄìMarch 2013. A lion's head corbel from the building was saved and is now on display in the green space on Wembley Hill Road, opposite York House. The former Wembley Conference Centre, and the Elvin House block, were also demolished in September 2006.http://www.quintain.co.uk/~/media/Files/Q/Quintain/2013-full-year- results/archive/nov-06-a.pdf Also in 2006, Wembley Arena, was refurbished at a cost of ¬£34m and its entrance turned around to open onto a new public square with a fountain facing the new Wembley Stadium which then opened in 2007. At the same time as the new stadium was being built, the old concrete footbridge at Wembley Stadium station, probably built for the British Empire Exhibition, was replaced by a new bridge and a public square. In 2005, after a BBC Five Live poll, it was decided to name the bridge the White Horse Bridge, after PC Scorey‚Äôs famous mount. The bridge and square opened in 2008. Wembley Park Sports Ground was located on Bridge Road, near the local station. In 2008 the site was closed down by the council and sold amid protests from locals. It was turned into an academic school with the building mostly completed by 2011. Developers Quintain and Family Mosaic have led new developments in the area, including residential Forum House completed in 2008 and Quadrant Court in March 2010. Demolition of Malcolm and Fulton House also took place that month. Later work began on the Wembley Park Boulevard leisure and retail hub, including a Hilton Hotel and an outlet shopping centre, the London Designer Outlet (LDO), which opened in August 2013. The development included Market Square and an open space, Wembley Lawns, centred at the Boulevard, and includes a children's playground. A civic centre was also built at Engineers Way serving as the new home of Brent's local authority. Brent Town Hall, the former home of the council located about a mile north, closed down and was sold, turning into a French lycee school that opened in September 2015. The Town Hall Library was also replaced by a new library adjoined with the civic centre. On Olympic Way, a student accommodation building ran by Victoria Hall Limited was opened in 2011, followed by a Novotel hotel and other buildings. A Boxpark branch also opened here in 2018. In 2015, Wembley Park's events programme brought 150,000 to the site to enjoy events from Color Run and Survival of the Fittest to a weekly food market. In May 2016, controversial regeneration plans in the stadium area were approved by the local council. The ¬£2.5 billion scheme from Quintain involves the building of over 7,000 apartments, as well as new shops and offices, two hotels, a 7-acre public park, and a school. There will be a total of seven residential and retail tower blocks, up to 19 storeys high. The plans were disapproved by the Football Association (FA) and by many locals, who claim increased overcrowding and spoilt stadium views. A local launched a petition against these plans to Brent North MP Barry Gardiner and the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. however the plans were approved nonetheless. Quintain unveiled plans for a further 250,000 square feet of retail space in the area in March 2018. ==Geography== View of the stadium from near the peak of Barn Hill, 2007 Barn Hill is 86 metres above sea level, and is part of the larger Fryent Country Park that continues towards Kingsbury. In addition, Wembley Hill Road is a steep road west of Wembley Park, which peaks at around 65 metres above sea level near The Green Man pub. The Wealdstone Brook tributary of the River Brent starts off at the Stadium Industrial Estate and runs between Bridge Road and Wembley Park Drive, and through Forty Avenue towards Preston. Bridge Road is so-called for the bridge over the narrow brook. ==Notable places== Church of St. Augustine An Orthodox Jewish synagogue Wembley United Synagogue is in Forty Avenue. Next to it is the Church of England St. Augustine's Church. A United Reformed Church is on the opposite side, past The Broadway intersection. There is a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Wembley Park Drive. Schools in the area include: Ark Academy, Preston Manor High School, College of North West London, and Lyc√©e International de Londres Winston Churchill. ==Notable people== * Keith Moon of The Who * Lady Sovereign * Harry Shearer * John Tavener * Humphry Repton * Sir Edward Watkin * Maxwell Ayrton * Owen Williams ==Nearby areas== * Preston * Neasden * Wembley * Kingsbury * North Wembley * Stonebridge * Sudbury ==Transport== Wembley Park Station in 2007 ===Trains=== Stations in the area are: * Wembley Park Station (Metropolitan line and Jubilee line) * Wembley Stadium Station (Chiltern Main Line) ===Buses=== London Buses routes 83, 92, 182, 206, 223, 245 and 297 serve the area. Uno's 644 bus route terminated at Wembley Park from 2011 until being cut back to Queensbury in March 2016. ==References== ==External links== * Philip Grant - Wembley Park ‚Äì its story up to 1922 * Wembley Park's Heritage Timeline Category:Areas of London Category:Districts of the London Borough of Brent Category:Wembley ","title":"Wembley Park"},{"id":"1425561","text":"RCA TK-41 The RCA TK-40 is considered to be the first practical color television camera, initially used for special broadcasts in late 1953, and with the follow-on TK-40A actually becoming the first to be produced in quantity in March 1954. The TK-40 was produced by RCA Broadcast to showcase the new compatible color system for NTSC--eventually named NTSC-M or simply M --which the company is credited with inventing (though several other companies including Philco were involved in development). Color had been attempted many times before, often in a semi-mechanical fashion, but this was the first series of practical, fully electronic cameras to go into widespread production. NBC's 1950s star Perry Como poses with TK-41 camera The camera was quickly followed with the TK-41, a line that shared a very similar shape, but featured streamlined and enhanced electronic subsystems. Earlier TK-40s are distinguished by the lack of venting slots on the sides (the cameras were prone to overheating, necessitating the addition of these openings). The last variation of the TK-41 was the TK-41C, released circa 1960. The cameras are considered to have been of very good quality, better than the very different TK-42 which succeeded the TK-40/41, and probably better than anything produced by RCA for several years after the production line shut down (NBC didn't fully replace their TK-41s in Rockefeller Center or their Burbank, California broadcast facility until the release of the TK-44A around 1968). Prior development in the late 1940s and early 1950s had included the TK-X (for \\"experimental\\"). An image (beam) splitter was used in the TK-40/41 to direct the incoming light into three image orthicon tubes for recording moving pictures in the red, green, and blue component colors. The early cameras required a very large amount of lighting, which caused television studios to become very warm due to the use of multi-kilowatt lamps (a problem that still exists somewhat today, but is less pronounced). The RCA TK-40 and TK-41 color cameras required more than an hour to set up and were comparatively unstable, making frequent adjustment necessary to maintain correct color balance between the red, green, and blue primary colors. These cameras also required complicated control consoles and rack-mounted power supplies for the camera's many vacuum tubes and ventilator fans cooling their large image orthicon tubes. The cameras, which weighed hundreds of pounds on their own, were only one component of the TK-40/41 system. There were also backend devices placed in the control rooms (camera control units and colorplexers) to generate both full NTSC outputs routed to the program switchers as well as signals for the cameras for both video and intercom communication among crew members (the cameras integrated an audio system so that camera operators could talk to others via headsets). This combined chain was required in order to produce images. The TK-41's camera head weighed and had to be carried by at least two people when setting up for remote broadcasts. The TK-40 was used for a color telecast of the opera Carmen on October 31, 1953, apparently on a closed- circuit system (monochrome images were apparently broadcast with the color burst removed). The first commercial telecast was of the Colgate Comedy Hour with Donald O'Connor on November 22, but the color burst may have again been removed. The Federal Communications Commission finally approved the color system for use on December 17 of that year, allowing telecasts to begin 30 days later. Special permission was received to broadcast the Tournament of Roses Parade on January 1, 1954. Patti Page and her The Big Record show for CBS was the first television show broadcast in color for the entire 1957-1958 season. The live broadcast was staged in the now famous Ed Sullivan Theatre and production costs were greater than most movies were at the time not only because of all the stars featured on the hour-long extravaganza but the extreme high intensity lighting and electronics required for the new RCA TK-40 cameras. TK-40A camera setups were brought to several TV stations around the country as part of demonstrations throughout the year, including: WKY, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (April 8); WBAP, Fort Worth, Texas (May 15); WTMJ-TV, Milwaukee, Wisconsin (July 18); WBEN Buffalo, New York; WCCO Minneapolis, Minnesota, (August 5); and KTLA Los Angeles, California. ==Variations== *TK-40 (1953) *TK-40A (March 1954) *TK-41A (1954-?) *TK-41B *TK-41C (1960?-1967) ==References== ==External links== *RCA TK-40 and TK-41 color TV cameras in action *Color television camera development.

They are members of NCAA Division II and are the only Canadian university affiliated with the U.S.-based National Collegiate Athletic Association. The teams previously used the names \\"Clansmen\\" and \\"Clan,\\" but the names were retired in 2020 and a new team name will be selected. ==Conference membership history== SFU's teams formerly played in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics of the United States for all sports. In 1997, Simon Fraser sought to join the NCAA of the United States as a Division II school, but was turned down.Vancouver Province: UBC expects visit by NCAA 8 November 2005 After this, SFU decided in 2000‚Äì01 to partially transfer to Canadian Interuniversity Sport (now U Sports). Before the transfer, SFU did not compete in Canadian football, instead playing American football. On July 10, 2009, the NCAA approved SFU's bid to join NCAA Division II starting in 2011‚Äì12, where SFU intended to compete in the Great Northwest Athletic Conference. However, Canada West, the CIS association that SFU teams were scheduled to play in, issued a probation on all SFU teams for the 2010‚Äì11 season, leading to speculation that SFU teams would not have any conference to play in for that season. The GNAC admitted SFU one year earlier than planned as a full conference member in time for the 2010‚Äì11 season. This led to SFU playing American football again, which was the case before they joined the CIS. ==Varsity teams== SFU currently has 17 varsity programs competing in the following sports (affiliations included):The complete list of teams is available in the drop menus on the Department of Athletics' Home Page. *Basketball, men and women (NCAA D2); *Cross-country, men and women (NCAA D2); *Football, men (NCAA D2); *Golf, men and women (NCAA D2); *Soccer, men and women (NCAA D2); *Softball, women (NCAA D2); *Swimming, men and women (NCAA D2); *Track and field, men and women (NCAA D2); *Volleyball, women (NCAA D2); *Wrestling, men (NCAA D2) and women (Women's College Wrestling Association); SFU is the only school to have finished in the top five of the NAIA division of the NACDA Director's Cup, an award given to the top overall college sports program in the United States, in each year since the award was first given to NAIA schools in 1996. The program won the NAIA Cup consecutively from 1997 through 2001, and again in 2004. The last win was especially impressive because it occurred after SFU partially transferred to CIS. Oddly, SFU holds the NAIA record for most All-Americans and U.S. National Champions (individual). ===Football=== The SFU football team has been competing continuously since the athletic department's inception in 1965. The team played by American rules while they competed in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics from 1965 to 2001 against other American teams. Along with other SFU teams, the football program transferred to Canadian Interuniversity Sport (now U Sports) and thereby switched to playing Canadian football against Canadian University teams in 2002. While playing in the CIS, SFU won their first and only Hardy Trophy conference championship in 2003 while qualifying for the playoffs twice. After playing eight seasons in the Canada West Conference of the CIS, the football team began competing in the Great Northwest Athletic Conference of NCAA Division II in 2010, thereby playing football by American rules again since then. The team also maintains a cross-town rivalry with the Vancouver-based University of British Columbia Thunderbirds as they are also the only two universities in British Columbia that field football teams. Since 1967, the two teams have competed in the Shrum Bowl, an annual game played at alternating venues with alternating rules. SFU holds a 17‚Äì15‚Äì1 series lead while also being the most recent champion having won the 2010 game at Thunderbird Stadium. Due to the two schools playing in two different leagues and game formats, the scheduling of these games has often been difficult, with no game being played in 2011, the 12th time the game hadn't been played since the game's inception. ===Women's basketball=== Team championships: * 2010 CIS National Champions; * 2009 CIS National Champions; * 2007 CIS National Champions; * 2005 CIS National Champions; * 2002 CIS National Champions. ===Men's soccer=== Team championships and other highlights: * 2018 GNAC Champion, NCAA Division II Play-off Second Round; * 2017 GNAC Champion, NCAA Division II Play-off First Round; * 2016 GNAC Champion, NCAA Division II Play-off Second Round; * 2015 GNAC Runner-Up; * 2014 NCAA Division II Play-off Appearance; * 2013 GNAC Champion, NCAA Division II Final Four appearance; * 2012 GNAC Champion, NCAA Division II Final Four appearance (first non-US school to ever do so); * 2011 GNAC Champion; Ranked ‚Ññ. 1 in the NSCAA Coaches' Poll; * 2010 GNAC Champion; NAIA Final Four appearance; * 2007 NAIA Final Four appearance; * 2005 NAIA Region I Finals; * 2004 NAIA Region I Semi-finals; * 2003 NAIA Region I Champion; * 2002 NAIA Region I Champion; * 1987 NAIA National Finalists; * 1986 NAIA National Finalists; * 1983 NAIA National Champions; * 1982 NAIA National Champions; * 1980 NAIA National Finalists; * 1976 NAIA National Champions; * 1975 NAIA National Finalists; ====2012 and 2016 Play-off Hosting Controversies==== After the 2012 regular season, Simon Fraser's men's soccer team was ranked ‚Ññ. 1 in the West Region and has won the right to host the West Region playoffs. However, some other schools in the Region immediately filed complaints that some of their personnel did not have passports to enter Canada. As a result, NCAA stripped Simon Fraser of the right to host the playoffs. Simon Fraser first rented a neutral site in San Francisco, California, as the site of the play-offs, but NCAA eventually awarded the right of hosting the remaining matches of the regional play-offs to Grand Canyon University, whose men's soccer team was ranked ‚Ññ. 2 in the West Region after the 2012 regular season. After the 2016 regular season, Simon Fraser's men's soccer team was ranked ‚Ññ. 1 once again in the West Region and has won the right to host the West Region playoffs once again. However, Simon Fraser was once again forced to rent a neutral site, this time in Seattle, Washington, as the site of the play-offs. ===Women's soccer=== Team championships: * 2000 NAIA National Champions; * 1996 NAIA National Champions; ===Softball=== SFU women's softball players, left to right: Carly Moir, Trisha Bouchard and Stefani Durrant Team championships: * 2010 NAIA National Champions; * 2005 NAIA National Champions; * 2003 NAIA National Champions; * 1999 NAIA National Champions; ==Club teams== In addition to its 17 varsity programs, SFU currently has 4 competitive club programmes competing in intercollegiate sport leagues of the following sports (affiliations included): *Ice hockey, men (BCIHL); *Field lacrosse, men (MCLA D1); *Rowing, men and women‚Äôs (Rowing Canada); *Cheerleading (Power Cheerleading Athletics Collegiate Nationals); *Ultimate frisbee, open and women's (CUUC). ==Men's Ice Hockey== The men's ice hockey team currently competes in the British Columbia Intercollegiate Hockey League, a five team club hockey league spread across British Columbia and Washington. The team has won the league on three occasions most recently in 2010‚Äì11. The team also regularly plays games against NCAA and CIS opponents. They compete in a regular cross town rivalry with the neighboring UBC Thunderbirds. In the summer of 2016 the program began exploring the possibility of moving the program to the NCAA Division 1 level. The men's hockey team also hosts a bi-annual tournament in January called the Great Northwest Showcase involving top NCAA hockey programs. SFU mascot, McFogg the Dog == Mascot == The official mascot of SFU Athletics is McFogg the Dog, an anthropomorphic Scottish terrier who wears a kilt. McFogg was officially adopted as the University's mascot in 1996 and is named in honour of SFU's inaugural president Patrick McTaggart-Cowan who was nicknamed \\"McFog\\". McFogg replaced an unofficial gorilla mascot which the university had previously used since the late 1980s. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Great Northwest Athletic Conference Category:Sport in Burnaby ","title":"SFU Athletics"},{"id":"1425573","text":"Honest Jon's is a British independent record shop based on Portobello Road in Ladbroke Grove, London, operating since 1974.

Central Market is an American gourmet grocery store chain owned by H-E-B Grocery Company based in San Antonio, Texas. Most locations also have a full-service kitchen, offer cooking and wine classes in their culinary school, and offer catering services. The chain has ten locations, all in Texas. Central Market was named \\"Outstanding Specialty Food Retailer\\" by Specialty Food Magazine and the National Association for Specialty Food Trade.\\"Central Market wins national honor\\" , San Antonio Express-News, June 11, 2007. ==History== The original store opened in 1994 in the Central Park Shopping Center on North Lamar Boulevard in Austin, Texas. It was not long before H-E-B Grocery Company expanded the chain to Alamo Heights, Fort Worth, Dallas and Houston. The chain's second store opened in 1997 in a converted H-E-B on Broadway in the San Antonio area (in the Alamo Heights city limits). Two years later, a third store was opened on South Lamar in Austin. Fort Worth and Houston were introduced to the chain for the first time in 2001, with stores on West Freeway and Westheimer, respectively; the latter was on the former site of Fox owned-and-operated television station KRIV. Central Market's sixth and seventh stores opened in 2002 on East Lovers Lane in Dallas and Coit Road in Plano. Continuing its Dallas/Fort Worth area expansion, an eighth store opened at The Shops of Southlake in Southlake on December 6, 2006, and another store opened in the Preston Hollow neighborhood of Dallas on February 15, 2012. Their latest store opened on September 5, 2018, Dallas Texas' 3rd store, located at Midway and Northwest Highway. ==Central Market specialties== Central Market is known for its Caf√© on the Run. The chain also carries a line of exclusive organic products called Central Market Organics. The product line includes organic or all-natural items ranging from commodities such as milk and eggs to pasta sauce and cookie dough. Central Market deliberately limits floor space allocated to packaged products, allowing more space for fresh produce, meat and seafood, bulk products, and chef-prepared items.

Born in Trail, in the southern interior of the province, Georgetti first went to work in the giant Cominco smelter, just like his father. He worked in most areas of the smelter and earned his trade ticket as a pipefitter. Following the family tradition, Georgetti became active in the United Steelworkers of America Local 480, rising through the ranks to become president of the Local in 1981. Elected vice-president of the British Columbia Federation of Labour in 1984, he became its youngest-ever president two years later. At the same time, he broadened his national labour involvement by becoming a provincial vice-president of the CLC. ==Strategies== Georgetti has long advocated what he describes as \\"intelligent militancy\\". This proactive approach makes use of a wide range of strategies and tactics to achieve labour's goals. For example, as B.C. Fed President, Georgetti in 1987 led unionized workers in British Columbia in the largest one-day general strike in Canadian history, followed by a successful five-year boycott to protest labour laws and institutions established by the then Social Credit Party of British Columbia government. ==CLC goals== Georgetti's priorities as the leadership of the Canadian Labour Congress included the campaign to double the Canada Pension Plan benefits, defence and strengthening of public medicare, organizing greater numbers of workers, providing lifelong learning opportunities, enhancing youth's involvement in unions, increasing literacy levels for all Canadians and combating child labour. Promotion of labour rights and protection of employment standards in an increasingly globalized economy, and international development that respects workers' and human rights, are also key priorities. Under Georgetti's leadership, the CLC has spearheaded worldwide campaigns against corporate globalization, sweatshop manufacturers and the use of child and forced labour. Georgetti were also involved in international issues, continuing a long CLC tradition. He served as a Vice-President and member of the Executive Board of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions before it merged with World Confederation of Labour, and was a member of its Human and Workers' Rights Committee. He is currently a Vice-President and member of the Executive Board of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), and the chair of the ITUC Committee on Workers' Capital. He is also an executive member of the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). ==Awards== Georgetti has been recognized by various levels of government for his contributions to labour relations and the overall well- being of Canadian society. In 1998, he became the first union leader to be appointed to the distinguished Order of British Columbia. In 2000, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada - only the tenth labour leader to be so honoured. ==References== ==External links== * Ken Georgetti biography from the Canadian Labour Congress Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian trade unionists Category:Canadian people of Italian descent Category:People from Trail, British Columbia Category:Members of the Order of British Columbia Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:United Steelworkers people Category:Canadian Labour Congress ","title":"Ken Georgetti"},{"id":"1425584","text":"The Victoria Vikes are the athletic teams that represent the University of Victoria of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada in both men's and women's U Sports.

It was first performed in 1995 at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs in London. ==Synopsis== The play is set in an expensive hotel room in Leeds. Ian, a foul-mouthed middle-aged tabloid journalist has brought a young woman, Cate, to the room for the night. Cate is much younger than Ian, emotionally fragile, and seemingly intellectually simple. Throughout Scene 1, Ian tries to seduce Cate, but she resists. All the while, Ian proudly parades his misogyny, racism and homophobia. The scene ends with the sound of spring rain. Scene 2 begins the next morning. Ian engages in frottage with Cate during one of her fits. Afterwards, Cate performs oral sex on Ian, biting him. Cate retires to the bathroom. A soldier unexpectedly enters the room brandishing a gun, and finds Cate has escaped through the bathroom window. The hotel room is then struck by a mortar bomb, and the scene ends with the sound of summer rain. In Scene 3, the hotel room is in ruins; the bomb has blasted a hole in the wall. The soldier and Ian begin to talk, and it is gradually revealed that the hotel is located in the midst of a brutal war. The soldier tells Ian about appalling atrocities that he has witnessed and taken part in, involving rape, torture and genocide, and says he has done everything as an act of revenge for the murder of his girlfriend. He then rapes Ian, and sucks out his eyes. The scene ends with the sound of autumn rain. In Scene 4, Ian lies blinded next to the soldier, who has committed suicide. Cate returns, describing the city being overrun by soldiers, and bringing with her a baby that she has rescued. The baby dies, and she buries it in a hole in the floorboards and leaves, but not before arguing with Ian about the utility or futility of praying during a burial. The scene ends with the sound of heavy winter rain. Scene 5 consists of a series of brief images, showing Ian crying, masturbating and even hugging the dead soldier for comfort as he starves in the ruined room. Eventually, he crawls into the hole with the dead baby and eats it. The stage direction then reads that Ian dies. It starts raining, and Ian says \\"Shit\\". Cate returns, bringing sausage and gin. The blood seeping down her legs implies that she has paid for this by having sex with the soldiers outside. She eats and hand-feeds the rest of her meal to Ian, who says: \\"Thank you.\\"Kane, Sarah, Sarah Kane: Complete Plays.

She was a major talent. Apparently, Harold Pinter said at her memorial service that she was a poet, and I think that's dead right.\\"Simon Hattenstone,\\"A Sad Hurrah\\", Guardian 1 July 2000. After seeing a revival of the play, an Evening Standard reviewer Annie Ferguson wrote \\"How shrill and silly the 1995 hullabaloo and hysteria seemed last night when Blasted returned to the Royal Court. It is, and always was, a play with a fine, moral purpose.\\" It was listed in The Independent as one of the 40 best plays ever. ==Notes== ==Bibliography== *Kane, Sarah, Sarah Kane: Complete Plays.

Her family were of Rurikid stock, and related to the ancient grand princes of Russia. She was selected for marriage to Michael by his mother, Xenia Shestova, after several years of difficulty of finding a partner for the tsar. In 1616, Shestova refused to accept the tsar's choice of Maria Ivanovna Khlopova, and Michael I had eventually been forced to give up his plans to marry her. In 1619, the tsar's father Patriarch Philaret of Moscow suggested he marry the sister of John, Prince of Schleswig-Holstein, but eventually, these negotiations were discontinued. In 1623, Xenia Shestova selected Maria Dolgorukova as a marriage partner because of her family connections: her sister had been married to prince Ivan Shuisky the Button, brother of Vasili IV of Russia, the last of the Rurikid dynasty. The wedding took place on 19 September 1624. Not long after the wedding, tsaritsa Maria took ill. She finally died 17 January 1625, four months after the wedding. There were rumors at the time that she had been poisoned by fractions at court determined to prevent any potential pro-Rurikid influence, or by the enemies of the Dolgorukov family. Chronicles called her death a divine punishment for the fate of the previous fiancee of the tsar, Maria Ivanovna Khlopova. ==References== *–ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∏ –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ XV-–Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∞ XX –≤–µ–∫–∞. // –†–µ–¥. –ê. –ü. –ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤. –°—Ç—Ä. 254. - - Category:1601 births Category:1625 deaths Category:17th-century Russian people Category:17th-century Russian women Maria Category:House of Romanov Category:Russian tsarinas Category:Burials at Ascension Convent ","title":"Maria Dolgorukova"},{"id":"1425651","text":"The Nipissing Lakers are the athletic teams that represent Nipissing University in North Bay, Ontario, Canada that compete in U Sports.

He received recognition for his photograph of John of Saxony on horseback in 1867. He then took over his father's company in Lissa, mainly working as a portrait photographer and as a decorative painter. Ansch√ºtz made his first instantaneous photographs in 1881. He developed his portable camera that allowed shutter speeds as short as 1/1000 of a second in 1882. He made a name for himself with sharp photographs of imperial military demonstrations in Breslau in 1882 and gained more fame with pictures of flying storks in 1884. He organized exhibitions of his work at the Berlin Kriegsakadmie and the D√ºsseldorf Kunsthalle. In 1885, Ansch√ºtz started working on chronophotography, leading to very successful exhibitions of motion pictures with his Electrotachyscope from 1887 onward (see below). Ansch√ºtz made pictures of the firing of cannonballs at 76 millionths of a second with a shutter that he patented on 11 November 1888 as the Brennebenen-Verschlu√ü, marketed in cameras by C.P. Goerz & Co for almost 30 years. Anch√ºtz designs at least three different camera models for the company in collaboration with Carl Paul Goerz. Ansch√ºtz moved to Berlin in 1888 and opened a studio at Charlottenstr. 59. == Awards == *Bronze medal at the 1883 photographic exhibition in Brussels *Vermeille medal from the Photografischen Gesellschaft in Wien on 14 January 1887 (for his series of systematic instantaneous photography) *Silver medal at the 1889 Photographischen Jubil√§umsausstellung in Berlin *Honorary diploma at the July 1891 photographic exhibition in Brussels. *Gold medal at the 1900 Photographischen Ausstellung in Berlin ==Motion picture work== Ansch√ºtz started making chronophotographs of horses with 12 cameras in 1885, sponsored by the Prussian minister of Culture. He continued the motion studies of horses with 24 cameras under assignment of the Ministery of War at K√∂niglichen Milit√§rreitinstitut (Royal Military Institute) in Hannover during 1886, resulting in over one hundred series of sequential photographs. The quality of his pictures was generally regarded to be much higher than that of the chronophotography works Eadweard Muybridge and √âtienne-Jules Marey. The works that these pioneers had published by then showed not much more than silhouettes, while Ansch√ºtz' pictures had a much more natural gradient. In 1886, Ansch√ºtz developed the Electrotachyscope, an early device that displayed short motion picture loops with 24 glass plate photographs on a 1.5 meter wide rotating wheel that was hand-cranked to the speed of circa 30 frames per second. Each image was illuminated by a sparking spiral Geissler tube and displayed on a small opal glass window in a wall in a darkened room for up to seven spectators. Different versions were shown at many international exhibitions, fairs, conventions and arcades from 1887 until at least 1894. From 1890 onward, Ansch√ºtz also demonstrated a coin-operated cylindrical Electrotachyscope with six small viewing screens. Starting in 1891, some 152 examples of a coin-operated peep-box Electrotachyscope model were manufactured by Siemens & Halske in Berlin and sold internationally. It was used in a public arcade and was displayed at the International Electrotechnical Exhibition in Frankfurt. Nearly 34,000 people paid to see it at the Berlin Exhibition Park in summer 1892. Others saw it in London or at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. On 25 November 1894, Ansch√ºtz introduced a Electrotachyscope projector with a 6x8 meter screening in Berlin. Between 22 February and 30 March 1895, a total of circa 7,000 paying customers came to view a 1.5-hour show of some 40 scenes at a 300-seat hall in the old Reichstag building in Berlin. == Legacy == Ansch√ºtz' 1884 albumen photographs of storks inspired aviation pioneer Otto Lilienthal's experimental gliders in the late 1880s. Ansch√ºtz' many international motion picture exhibitions between 1887 and 1894 probably inspired many other pioneers in the history of film technology. Although there's no discrete evidence, Georges Demen√ø most likely saw Ansch√ºtz' \\"Sprechende Portr√§ts\\" before developing his Phonoscope in 1891. Edison or his employees may have seen the Electrotachyscope (in New York possibly as early as 1887) and their peep-box Kinetoscope machines were probably influenced by the Siemens & Halske type of Electrotachyscope. == References == == External links == * * \\"Schnellseher\\" and \\"Electrotachyscope\\" * Collections with photographs taken by Ottomar Ansch√ºtz * Photography of storks and moving pictures of the flight of a crane in his \\"Schnellseher\\" (quick-viewer) * Photographs of Lilienthal's flights in 1893/94 * Goerz Photographing Experiments and the first flight of Otto Lilienthal * Category:Photographers from Berlin Category:German inventors Category:People of the German Empire Category:1846 births Category:1907 deaths Category:People from Leszno Category:People from the Province of Posen ","title":"Ottomar Ansch√ºtz"},{"id":"1425660","text":"There are several places called Willoughby Bay.

The term was coined in a 1956 commencement address by then-Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy. Speaking at the Jesuit university, he was likely making reference to the Ivy League, an athletic conference established in 1954. The term \\"Jesuit Ivy\\" was somewhat of a contradiction in terms. The Ivy League's members were generally Protestant-founded institutions; Boston College had itself been founded in part to educate Boston's predominantly Irish, Catholic immigrant community in the nineteenth century. The nickname suggested both Boston College's rising stature and the declining prevalence of discrimination at elite American universities. Kennedy, a Catholic whose family were longtime Boston College benefactors, graduated from Harvard in 1940; as did his father in 1912, and his brothers Joe Jr, Robert and Edward in 1938, 1948 and 1956 respectively. The term has been used as a nickname for the school. ==JFK at BC== John F. Kennedy visited Boston College in an official capacity seven times during his tenures as Massachusetts Senator and President of the United States‚Äîmore frequently than he visited any other university, including his own alma mater, Harvard. In addition to commencement and convocation speeches, Kennedy addressed BC's Alumni Association, Varsity Club, and College of Business Administration (forerunner to the Carroll School of Management), and offered a series of seminars in the spring semester of 1958. While the Jesuit Ivy speech is perhaps his most well-known address at Boston College, Kennedy's 1963 Convocation Address would prove to be the most historic. It was both the inaugural event of BC's centennial commemoration and one of Kennedy's last public appearances before his assassination. ==The Jesuit Ivy Address== The following is an excerpt of the address given by Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy at the Boston College commencement exercises in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts on June 26, 1956. ==The Kennedys and Boston College== The ties between the Kennedy family and Boston College date to John F. Kennedy's grandfather, John F. \\"Honey Fitz\\" Fitzgerald, Boston's second Irish-Catholic mayor and a member of the Boston College Class of 1885. John F. Kennedy's father, Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr, became the first Kennedy to attend Harvard instead of Boston College though he remained a long-time Boston College benefactor. In 1946, the Kennedys established the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation and funded the construction of the Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. Memorial Hall at Boston College, now a part of Campion Hall and home to BC's Lynch School of Education. The foundation was led by Senator Edward M. Kennedy up until his death in August 2009. Other Kennedys who have attended Boston College include Kerry Kennedy, Christopher Kennedy Lawford, Christopher George Kennedy, Saoirse Kennedy Hill, Samuel Kennedy Shriver, and Robert F.

The Warriors have found success over certain spans in football, hockey, rugby, golf and basketball among others, and the Warriors have won national championships in hockey (1974), basketball (1975), and women's swimming (1975). For many years from the 1960s through the 1990s, Warrior basketball games attracted the largest and rowdiest basketball crowds in the country. The Warriors Football teams have won two Yates Cup Championships, in 1997 and in 1999. The team's 2010 season was cancelled after a steroid scandal, the biggest ever in CIS Football history. Waterloo's teams were originally known as the \\"Mules\\" after the school's founding in 1957, and for a while the women's teams were the \\"Mulettes\\", a name that was almost universally despised and ultimately replaced by \\"Athenas\\". Today the women's teams also use the nickname Warriors. University Stadium was originally built for the Warriors Football program, but was sold to the City of Waterloo in 1974 when UW could not afford to repair the stadium. The stadium was later sold by the City of Waterloo to Wilfrid Laurier University in 1992, where it is now the home of the Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks.

The Lancers won their division in 1965, but lost the OIAA final to Laurentian University in a sudden-death 4‚Äì2 loss. In 1968, the Lancers were promoted to the QOAA. In 1971, the QOAA was dissolved and the Lancers joined the newly formed Ontario University Athletics Association, now known as the OUA. The Windsor Lancers men's hockey team is currently led by Head Coach Kevin Hamlin. Coach Hamlin has led the Lancers to tremendous success including the 2013‚Äì14 OUA Queen's Cup Championship and two straight CIS national championship tournament appearances. In 2008‚Äì09, Hamlin's first season, he was named the OUA Men's Hockey Coach of the Year after leading the Lancers to a 15-point turnaround in the standings from the previous year. In 2010‚Äì11, Hamlin's Lancers finished the regular season with a 12‚Äì12‚Äì4 record as he led Windsor back into the playoffs for the second straight season. His second year behind the Lancer bench came in 2009‚Äì10 where led the Lancers back to the playoffs as they advanced to the OUA West Semi-Finals. In 2011‚Äì12, he led the Lancers to their best season in over a decade as they finished 15‚Äì12‚Äì1 and advanced the Western Conference finals. Coach Hamlin's squad finished the year ranked #11 in the country. In 2012‚Äì13, Coach Hamlin's squad finished 18‚Äì9‚Äì1 and in second place in the OUA Western conference. The Lancers finished as one of the top scoring teams in the nation including 8th in Canada in goals and 6th in the CIS in power-play goals. In 2013‚Äì14, Coach Hamlin led his squad to the Queen's Cup Ontario Championship for only the second time in school history. They also finished the season ranked #5 in Canada ‚Äì the program's highest ever finish in the national rankings. Hamlin was honoured with both the Windsor Essex Sports (WESPY) Coach of the Year award and the Gino Fracas Coach of the Year award for his outstanding work behind the bench. En route to winning the Queen's Cup, the Lancers enjoyed a tremendous playoff run that included playoff series wins over Toronto, Western, Lakehead and McGill to earn the title. At the CIS National Championship tournament, Windsor also earned their first ever victory at Nationals as they knocked off the A.U.S. champion Acadia Axemen 4‚Äì2 in pool play.

Kenny Bradford was named the OUA Defenseman of the year and a CIS All-Canadian after he led the CIS in scoring by a defenceman with 28 points, scoring eight goals and adding 20 assists. He was a key cog in the Lancers third-ranked power play, scoring six of his eight goals on the man advantage.

Castro was an ancient city on the west side of Lake Bolsena in the present-day comune of Ischia di Castro, northern Lazio, Italy. It was destroyed at the conclusion of the Wars of Castro in the 17th century. ==Early history== The settlement of Castro was founded in prehistoric times, and was later the seat of an unspecified Etruscan city, probably Statonia. In the Middle Ages it had a castle (Latin: castrum), hence the name. Although an autonomous commune, it remained nonetheless under papal suzerainty. In 1527 a pro-independence faction assumed power, but they were later ousted by Pier Luigi Farnese, whose family was to rule Castro until the 17th century. In the same year another Farnese, Gian Galeazzo, sacked it in the wake of the Sack of Rome. Ten years later, in 1537, three years after the election of Alessandro Farnese as Pope Paul III, it became the seat of an independent duchy under his son Pier Luigi Farnese. The town, which in the meantime had been reduced to \\"gypsies' huts\\" (in the words of a contemporary), was reconstructed according to the design of Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. ==The Renaissance and the Wars of Castro== The Farnese treated Castro well and consecutive family patriarchs made improvements to the city including churches and their own Palazzo Farnese. Between 1639 and 1641, the Farnese, then led by Duke of Parma Odoardo Farnese, came into conflict with the powerful Barberini family of Pope Urban VIII who responded by sending an army to occupy Castro. The Farnese and the papacy fought a stalemate war and the Pope agreed to treaty terms only months before his death in 1644. When Pope Innocent X replaced Urban, he demanded that Duke Odoardo's son Ranuccio II Farnese, Duke of Parma adhere to the conditions of the peace treaty. Ranuccio refused to pay the agreed reparations. He also refused to admit the newly appointed bishop of Castro. When the latter was on his way to take possession of his see, he was murdered, a crime for which Innocent X placed the blame on Ranuccio. He sent troops to Castro and had the city razed on 2 September 1649. He erected a column reading \\"Qu√¨ fu Castro\\" (\\"Here stood Castro\\"). It was never rebuilt. The seat of the diocese of Castro, which is believed to have dated back to the 8th century, was transferred to Acquapendente.Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, pp. 659-660Konrad Eubel, Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi, vol. 1, pp. 173-174; vol. 2, pp. XIX, 121; vol. 3, p. 157; vol. 4, p. 140 No longer a residential bishopric, Castro (Castrum in Latin) is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 862 ==Sources== * * ==See also== *House of Farnese *Wars of Castro *Annibale Caro ==References== *Cigola, Riccardo. \\"History: Facts & Persons\\".

Eudoxia Streshnyova was a daughter of the noble Lukyan Stepanovich Streshnyov (d. 1630) from Mozhaysk and Anna Konstantinovna Volkonskaya. Her mother died shortly after birth, and her father left home to serve in the military. She was thus regarded almost an orphan and was raised by a rich relative who belonged to the circle of the tsar's court in Moscow. ===Marriage=== Eudoxia Streshnyova was among those daughters of the nobility summoned to appear in the Bride-show at court, when the tsar was to select his new tsaritsa, after his first spouse had died. Tsar Michael did not like any of those selected for him to choose from, but was pressed by his parents to make a choice. He eventually chose Eudoxia because of her beauty, polite behavior and mild disposition. The parents of the tsar were reportedly displeased with his choice. His mother, Xenia Shestova, claimed that Streshnyova was not of an important enough family, and that he risked angering all the most high ranked noble families by choosing a bride from a family of a lower rank than them. However, the tsar refused to change his mind. He did not only refer to his feelings, but also to his Christian duty to help a girl who would otherwise be forced to leave court and anger her family. She was described as a modest and virtuous girl, dominated by her proud relatives, who sometimes brought her to tears but still did not complain. Reportedly, the tsar was moved by her situation and felt sorry for her. The wedding was conducted on 5 February 1626. As was the custom, Eudoxia was given the title of Tsaritsa prior to the wedding, but only three days before the wedding, which was a much shorter time period than usual. Her parents-in-law both participated in the ceremony. They wished to change her name to Anastasia from the tsaritsa of tsar Ivan, but she successfully refused. After the wedding, she was given several lands, and a substantial fortune of her own. ===Tsaritsa=== As tsaritsa, Eudoxia Streshneva lived secluded from contact with men, as was expected from a Russian noblewoman at the time, but despite this, she was also expected to participate in public religious and charitable duties and manage the imperial household.Massie, Robert K., Peter the Great: his life and world, Abacus, London, 1995[1980] Tsaritsa Eudoxia was known to have been in a difficult situation in the imperial court because of her mother-in-law, Xenia Shestova, who dominated her and the life of the imperial court. She and her mother-in- law shared the same confessor and diak. Xenia Shestova accompanied her daughter-in-law during all her official visits to monasteries and churches, and managed her public life as a tsaritsa. She also chose tutors for her grandchildren, dominating her relationship to them. Eudoxia never managed to achieve any influence over tsar Mikhail, either during or after the death of her mother-in-law. Reportedly, Eudoxia was under great pressure to produce a son and heir to the throne, a task which gave her great anxiety until the birth of Tsarevich Aleksei in 1629. After the birth of her last child in 1639, tsar Michael reportedly did no longer wish to share her bed. She is noted to have given donations to churches and convents in order to be given another child, but without success. In 1642, Eudoxia financed the rebuilding of the Saint George Monastery in Meshchovsk. She also benefited the Ivanovsky Convent, where she made several visits and often prayed to Saint Martha during her pregnancies. She founded several charitable institutions, and made public donations to charitable and religious subjects. ===Death=== Eudoxia Streshneva died shortly after her spouse. She was buried in the Ascension Convent. ==Issue== Yevdokiya and Mikhail had ten children: { border=\\"1\\" style=\\"border- collapse: collapse;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#cccccc\\" !Name!!Birth!!Death - Tsarevna Irina22 April 16278 February 1679 - Tsarevna Pelagiya 20 April 162825 January 1629 - Tsarevich Aleksei9 May 162929 January 1676 - Tsarevna Anna14 August 163127 October 1676 - Tsarevna Marfa163121 September 1632 - Tsarevich Ivan 1 June 163310 January 1639 - Tsarevna Sofiya 14 September 163423 April 1636 - Tsarevna Tatyana5 January 163623 August 1706 - Tsarevna Yevdokiya 1637?10 February 1637 - Tsarevich Vasily 1638/39?25 March 1639 } ==References== * - - Category:1608 births Category:1645 deaths Category:17th-century Russian people Category:17th-century Russian women Category:House of Romanov Category:Russian tsarinas ","title":"Eudoxia Streshneva"},{"id":"1425721","text":"The Northern Securities Company was a short-lived American railroad trust formed in 1901 by E. H. Harriman, James J. Hill, J.P. Morgan and their associates. The company controlled the Northern Pacific Railway; Great Northern Railway; Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad; and other associated lines. It was capitalized at $400 million, and Hill served as president. The company was sued in 1902 under the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 by the Justice Department under President Theodore Roosevelt, one of the first antitrust cases filed against corporate interests instead of labor. The government won its case, and the company was dissolved, so that the three railroads again operated independently. Hill was the president of the Great Northern Railway and Harriman controlled the Union Pacific Railroad, two of the largest railroads in the U.S. Both sought control of the Burlington to connect their roads to the vital railroad hub of Chicago, Illinois. Hill, who also had a minority interest in the Northern Pacific Railway, outbid Harriman for the Burlington, by agreeing to Burlington President Charles Elliott Perkins's $200-a-share price. Together, the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific assumed control of nearly 100 percent of the Burlington's outstanding stock. Knowing that the Northern Pacific controlled almost 49.3 percent of the Burlington's stock, Harriman launched a stock raid against the Northern Pacific. Control of the Northern Pacific would allow him to appoint directors to the Burlington, which could then be forced to treat Harriman's Union Pacific favorably in business matters. Harriman's stock raid in May 1901 led to the \\"Northern Pacific Corner\\". Speculators had sold shares that they did not own, and were now desperate to purchase shares at any price-some shares reportedly sold at $1,000. Hill, working with J.P. Morgan, took majority control of the Northern Pacific despite Harriman's best efforts. This speculation resonated throughout the stock market and the country as a whole. The two men, their backers, and associates agreed to settle their differences and eliminate ruinous competition through a monopolistic combination. The Northern Securities Company was formed by Hill to control the stock of his major railroad properties. Some of Harriman's directors were appointed as representatives for his holdings of Northern Pacific shares. A public outcry over the new company made its way throughout the country, and both state and federal officials prepared to file litigation. On February 19, 1902, the United States Department of Justice announced plans to file a suit against the company. When approached by J. P. Morgan to settle the issue in private, President Roosevelt refused; he later remarked, \\"Mr. Morgan could not help regarding me as a big rival operator who either intended to ruin all his interests or could be induced to come to an agreement to ruin none.\\" Although Roosevelt still believed that trusts were not always bad for society, he could not bear to feel treated as just another rival operator. The suit continued. The Justice Department won the suit and the company was dissolved according to the 1904 Supreme Court ruling in Northern Securities Co. v. United States case, decided five to four. The companies were convicted under the Sherman Antitrust Act. In the following seven years, 44 other Federal antitrust cases turned out rulings similar to the Northern Securities case. Included in these break-ups were Harriman's own holdings of the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific railroads. The Northern Securities case was one of the earliest antitrust cases and provided important legal precedents for many later cases, including that against Major League Baseball. In 1955 the Northern Pacific and Great Northern renewed talks of merging. The Supreme Court approved the merger, and as a result, the Great Northern, Northern Pacific, Chicago Burlington & Quincy, and the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway merged on March 2, 1970, to form the Burlington Northern Railroad. ==Notes and references== ==Further reading== * Brown, R.

This makes √öjlip√≥tv√°ros quite different from the other parts of the inner city, which were mainly built before World War I, mostly in the last three decades of the nineteenth century. The very first buildings of √öjlip√≥tv√°ros (the so-called \\"Palatinus houses\\") are notable exceptions, these were built in 1910-1911, and represent an interesting mixture of art nouveau and other contemporary styles. 1 It has been a popular middle-class/intellectual residential district ever since it was built. Between the wars it was especially popular among middle-class citizens of Jewish origin and this is partially true even today, according to recent sociological research. 2 The area closest to the river Danube is the most expensive, spacious and pleasant, especially the buildings around Szent Istv√°n park, which is located on the riverside. Some of these buildings (especially the so-called \\"Dunapark houses\\") are regarded by many as one of the best examples of modernist architecture in Hungary. ==Bauhaus in Budapest== The style of the district is often described as \\"Bauhaus\\", though this is not precise (the inner parts of the district are very densely built-up, and this was sharply criticized by Bauhaus architects in the thirties as pseudo-modernist architecture, with buildings featuring modernist-like facades, but bad structure), it is true that in this district one can find perhaps the best display of modern Hungarian architecture. Some of the building stock and the infrastructure has been renovated in the last fifteen years, including Szent Istv√°n park. The district has quite serious problems with parking and over-crowdedness, especially in the narrower streets of its inner parts. Its main street is Pozsonyi √∫t, a tree-lined street close to the river with a lot of restaurants, bookstores and shops. ==See also== * Bauhaus in Budapest Category:Neighbourhoods of Budapest Category:Pest, Hungary ","title":"√öjlip√≥tv√°ros"},{"id":"1425724","text":"The Laval Rouge et Or (, Red and Gold) are the athletic teams that represent Universit√© Laval, located in Quebec City, Quebec.

The university features teams in swimming, golf, hockey, soccer, cross-country, volleyball and cheerleading. Notably, the men's ice hockey team has won four University Cup national championships since the program was first established in 1969. The men's soccer team has won one national championship, coming in 2019. ==History== Previous Patriotes logo used until 2019. In 1969, the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Trois-Rivi√®res was established along with its athletics program. The team name \\"Patriotes\\" was selected following a contest where it was suggested by G√©rald Baril, a history student and hockey player, because of its sense of rallying, dynamism and commitment to the environment. Originally, the team colours were blue, orange, and white, but was change to green, orange, and white in 1976 when the Universit√© du Qu√©bec system assigned a distinct colour to each of the universities in their network. The Patriotes began with an offering of four sports programs, football, men's and women's basketball, and men's hockey. However, with the shifting landscape of philosophy regarding education and sports, football and both basketball programs were all dropped by the 1980s due to a financial crisis. A women's hockey program operated from 1976 to 2000 while the men's and women's soccer programs began in 1985 and 1987, respectively. The women's volleyball program operated from 1978 to 1981 but was the only currently-operating varsity program at UQTR to be revived as the sport was brought back in 2004. With the construction of the Centre for Physical Activity and Sport (CAPS), the Olympic-size swimming pool welcomed the first swimming team at UQTR in 1996. Golf was added in 2000 and cross- country and cheerleading were added as programs in 2010. The Patriotes introduced a new logo in 2019 for the program's 50th anniversary. ==Varsity teams== UQTR men's goalie during 2013-14 season. ===Men's hockey=== The Patriotes men's ice hockey team has been the only program in continuous operation since UQTR was first established in 1969. The team competed in the Ottawa-St. Lawrence Conference (OSLC) for their first two seasons before moving to the Quebec Universities Athletic Association (QUAA) in 1971. The Patriotes won their first conference championship in 1986 and made their first appearance in the University Cup tournament where they finished with a silver medal as the runner-up. The next year, in 1987, the Patriotes repeated as QUAA champions and won the CIAU national championship over the Saskatchewan Huskies, which was also the first national championship win for a Patriotes team. In 1987, UQTR, McGill, and Concordia joined the OUAA due to the lack of teams in Quebec that were competing in the QUAA. The Patriotes continued their success in the OUAA, winning the East Division regular season title in each of their first five seasons there before winning back-to-back Queen's Cup conference championships in 1991 and 1992. The Patriotes also won their second national championship in 1991 after defeating the Alberta Golden Bears. The team enjoyed a stretch of dominance from 1998 to 2003 there they won five consecutive Queen's Cup championships. The Patriotes also played in the University Cup final three years in a row from 2001 to 2003, winning in 2001 and 2003, both times over the St. Francis Xavier X-Men. The Patriotes won the Queen's Cup three more times in 2007, 2013, and 2016, but did not replicate their national success and could not make it past the second round in each U-Cup tournament. The program's four University Cup national titles are tied for the fourth-most in U Sports men's ice hockey. ===Men's soccer=== The Patriotes men's soccer program was first established in 1985. The team won their first QUAA conference championship in 1995 and qualified for their first national championship tournament that year, finishing in fifth place. The team won conference championships again in 2001 and 2012. In 2019, the Patriotes finished as runner-ups to the RSEQ championship, but in doing so, they qualified for the national tournament. There, the sixth-ranked Patriotes defeated the UBC Thunderbirds and the Carleton Ravens to qualify for their first national championship game. On November 10, 2019, UQTR defeated the host team Montreal Carabins by a score of 2‚Äì0 to win their first U Sports men's soccer championship. ===Women's soccer=== The Patriotes women's soccer program was first established in 1987, but have not seen much success. The team has never finished higher than third place in the RSEQ regular season and has never won a conference championship. ===Women's volleyball=== The Patriotes women's volleyball program was in operation for three seasons from 1978 to 1981 before being discontinued. A team was revived in 2004 and competed in the RSEQ in the 2005-06 and 2006-07 seasons to little success. An RSEQ Division 2 was established for the 2010-11 seasons where the Patriotes joined and became that division's inaugural champion in 2011. The team has won six division 2 conference championships. == References == == External links == * Official website Category:U Sports teams Category:Sport in Trois-Rivi√®res Category:Universit√© du Qu√©bec Category:U Sports teams in Quebec ","title":"UQTR Patriotes"},{"id":"1425744","text":"The Sherbrooke Vert & Or (\\"Sherbrooke Green & Gold\\") is the athletic teams that represent the Universit√© de Sherbrooke in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.

DeGaetani was born in Massillon, Ohio. Educated at The Juilliard School with Sergius Kagen, she was best known for her wide range, precise pitch, clear tone, and command of extended techniques that made her voice perfectly suited to the demanding style of modern and avant-garde vocal composition. Her recording of Schoenberg's song cycle Pierrot lunaire is one of the classic recordings of the piece. (Due to its use of atonality, wide range, and virtuoso techniques such as sprechstimme, all while requiring a lyrical sensibility, it is exceptionally difficult to sing.) Her collaboration with George Crumb was also a fruitful one; she premiered his song cycle Ancient Voices of Children, and many of his other works were written for her. Uncommonly for a singer of her caliber (though her voice was not as powerful as most), DeGaetani rarely appeared in opera, instead concentrating on solo recital work in the art song literature. Her talent at foreign languages also made her an accomplished interpreter of lieder; she sang and recorded works by composers such as Hugo Wolf, Hector Berlioz, and Gustav Mahler and was noted for her intelligence and skillful analytical interpretation. Her interpretive skills also lent themselves to songs in her native tongue of English, such as Aaron Copland's 12 Poems of Emily Dickinson, and the songs of Charles Ives. On the other end of the spectrum, DeGaetani was also a noted performer of the medieval and Renaissance repertoire. DeGaetani made her New York performance debut in 1958. Afterward, she performed with the Contemporary Chamber Ensemble regularly, and also appeared with several world-famous orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic, the BBC Symphony, and the Chicago Symphony, and made numerous recordings with them and in chamber ensembles. She was professor of voice at Eastman School of Music and Artist in Residence at the Aspen Music Festival from 1973 until her death. Notable students include American sopranos Dawn Upshaw, Karen Holvik, Ren√©e Fleming, and Lucy Shelton, mezzo-sopranos Milagro Vargas and Mary Nessinger, and baritone William Sharp. DeGaetani died in Rochester, New York, in 1989, aged 56, of leukemia. == Discography == *Songs From a Colonial Tavern as sung by Taylor Vrooman also with Marvin Hayes, Bass (1964) *Pierrot Lunaire by Schoenberg (1971) *Songs by Stephen Foster, with Leslie Guinn (1972) *Las Cantigas de Santa Maria - Songs and Instrumental Music from the Court of Alfonso X, with the Waverly Consort, Michael Jaffee, dir.

The screenplay by Peter Morgan focuses on the chance meeting each of three childhood friends now living in London has with an American tourist. ==Plot== Fed up with her dead-end job with a Minneapolis car rental agency, Martha quits, cashes her final paycheck, and uses the money to purchase an airline ticket to the least expensive international destination she can find - London. At the airport, she meets Daniel, a successful music label executive, who covertly arranges for her to be upgraded to First Class and seated next to him on the flight. When she sells the ticket to another passenger and Daniel finds his seatmate is an obnoxiously loud woman instead of the girl of his dreams, he moves back to the Economy section and takes the vacant seat next to Martha. Before landing in London, he offers her the use of a deluxe suite in a luxury hotel at his company's expense in exchange for a lunch date the following day. Through a series of flashbacks and flashforwards, we learn Laurence, a former bridge champion who now teaches the game to wealthy women, went to the airport to pick up Daniel but missed him because the flight landed early. Instead, he literally runs into Martha, who hits him with a luggage cart while searching for the exit. She coerces him into taking her into the city and invites him to the suite for dinner. While she is in the bathroom, a bouquet of flowers from Daniel is delivered to the suite, and when Laurence sees the attached card, he departs without explanation. The following day, Martha meets struggling actor Frank, who has fled an audition in a panic and has gone to the park to console himself with a half-bottle of whiskey. Having heard about her from Daniel, he realizes who she is and calls Laurence to boast that he is about to make her his conquest. He takes her to a nearby art gallery. Martha slips away and heads for the exit, where she reunites with Laurence, who was looking for the pair. He invites her back to his flat and she accepts. Torn between loyalty to Daniel and love for Martha, Laurence seeks advice from Pederson, a neighbour he mistakenly believes is a psychiatrist, in the early morning hours. In the interim, Martha awakens and seeing a photograph of the three friends, assumes she has been the target of an elaborate practical joke. To get even, she separately invites each of the men to meet her for breakfast and when all three arrive, bearing floral arrangements of varying size, a brawl ensues. Laurence sees Martha running off in the distance but is unable to catch her. Despondent, he goes to a travel agency to purchase a ticket anywhere he can go for ¬£99, which proves to be Reykjav√≠k. At the airport gate, he is told he is being seated in First Class and when he boards the plane, he finds Martha waiting for him. She reveals she was responsible for the upgrade, a trick she learned from Daniel. ==Cast== *Monica Potter as Martha *Joseph Fiennes as Laurence *Tom Hollander as Daniel *Rufus Sewell as Frank *Ray Winstone as Pedersen ==Production== The film was shot on location in Minneapolis, at Stansted Airport in Essex, and at various London locations, including Battersea Park, Blakes Hotel in South Kensington, and South Bank. The soundtrack includes \\"Halo\\" by Texas, \\"Brown Paper Bag\\" by Roni Size, \\"Fall in Love with Me\\" by Booth and the Bad Angel, \\"Fools Like Us\\" by Echo & the Bunnymen, \\"Tape Loop\\" by Morcheeba, and \\"I Only Want to Be with You\\" by Dusty Springfield. ==Critical reception== The film holds a 33% approval rating on aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 4.8/10, based on 9 reviews. Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 43, based on 10 reviews, considered to be \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Stephen Holden of The New York Times called the film \\"one of those coyly edited movies that fills in the mystifying gaps in its story by periodically doubling back to repeat a scene with new crucial information added.\\" He added, \\"To maintain its fizz, a comedy like The Very Thought of You requires the spicy contemporary equivalent of No√´l Coward banter. But if the story is a clever sitcomy contraption, the dialogue is pedestrian. Among the contestants for Martha's love, the only character with a distinctive personality is Hollander's vain, petulant Daniel, whose ego is in need of puncturing. As the shy, tongue-tied Laurence, who needs lessons in self- assertion, Fiennes lacks the debonair twinkle and the comic timing of Hugh Grant, who might have made the role come alive. As for Ms. Potter's Martha, the character is a fabrication that not even Ms. Roberts with all her wiles could have made believable.\\" Variety Derek Elley wrote: \\"Lack of real chemistry between the leads and unsteady direction by Nick Hamm dampen an otherwise promising screenplay by Peter Morgan.\\" He also called the film \\"in some respects a '90s version of Richard Lester's '60s comedy The Knack\\". ==DVD release== The Region 1 DVD was released by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on 14 December 1999. The film is in anamorphic widescreen format with an audiotrack and subtitles in English. There are no bonus features.

The conflict was a result of a power struggle between the papacy ‚Äì represented by members of two deeply entrenched Roman families and their popes, the Barberini and Pope Urban VIII and the Pamphili and Pope Innocent X ‚Äì and the Farnese dukes of Parma, who controlled Castro and its surrounding territories as the Duchy of Castro. ==Precursors== Papal politics of the mid-17th century were complicated, with frequently shifting military and political alliances across the Catholic world. While it is difficult to trace the precise origins of the feud between the duchy of Parma and the papacy, its origins can be looked for in political maneuverings occurring in the years or even decades preceding the start of military action. In 1611 a group of conspirators, nobles from Modena and Mantua, was accused of devising a plot to assassinate Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma and other members of the Farnese family in Parma. In reality, the plot had been \\"uncovered\\" when a prisoner (being held for unrelated crimes) confessed to it and implicated members of various noble houses. Though the accusations were likely untrue, 100 of the \\"conspirators\\" were tortured and eventually executed in Parma's main square in 1612. Many of their estates were confiscated leaving a large number of now legitimately discontented nobles. Until his death in 1622, Ranuccio remained paranoid about future assassination attempts and about curses from witches and heretics. He persecuted \\"witches\\" and alleged conspirators savagely and even had his own mistress, Claudia Colla, burned to death. He remained convinced that other noble families were plotting his downfall.Farnese: Pomp, Power and Politics in Renaissance Italy by Helge Gamrath (2007) However, tensions between the Farnese and other Italian nobility were not limited to local events in Parma. Historian Leopold von Ranke gives an account of a 1639 visit to Rome by Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza. The Duke arrived in Rome to great fanfare - he was given gifts and escorted around the city by Pope Urban's Cardinal-nephews, Antonio Barberini and Francesco Barberini. But the Duke refused to pay due deference to the Pope's other nephew; the newly appointed Prefect of Rome, Taddeo Barberini. As the Duke prepared to leave, he suggested that an escort from the city (ordinarily reserved for the Grand Duke of Tuscany) would be appropriate. Francesco Barberini refused. The Duke took his leave but urged the Pope to chastise both Cardinal-nephews.History of the popes; their church and state (Volume III) by Leopold von Ranke (Wellesley College Library, 2009) The nephews were furious and convinced the pope to punish the Duke by banning grain shipments originating in Castro from being distributed in Rome and the surrounding territory, thereby depriving the Duke of an important source of income.War over Parma by Alexander Ganse (KLMA, 2004) Duke Odoardo's Roman creditors saw their chance - the Duke was unable to pay his debts, which he had accumulated in military adventures against the Spanish in Milan and in luxurious living. The unpaid and unhappy creditors sought relief from the pope, who turned to military action in an attempt to force payment. ==Preparations for war== Pope Urban VIII responded to the requests of Duke Odoardo's creditors by sending his nephew Antonio, Fabrizio Savelli and Marquis Luigi Mattei to occupy the city of Castro. Papal forces also included commanders Achille d'√âtampes de Valen√ßay and Marquis Cornelio Malvasia. At the same time, the pope sent cardinal Bernardino Spada as plenipotentiary in an effort to resolve the crisis. Spada successfully negotiated a truce but when the pope's military leaders became aware that the dukes were massing troops to counter their own (in case discussions with Spada came to naught), Urban VIII declared the articles of peace null and void and claimed Spada had negotiated them without his consent.Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) Spada later published a manifesto detailing his version of events which, according to contemporary John Bargrave, many accepted to be the truth. Indeed, Urban VIII had been amassing troops in Rome throughout 1641. Mercenaries and regular troops filled the streets and Antonio Barberini was forced to institute special measures to maintain authority over the city. But the papacy needed yet more troops. The Duke of Ceri, who had been imprisoned for wounding a papal officer in a dispute over the management of the Duchy of Ceri, and Mario Frangipani, imprisoned for murdering someone on his estate, were both pardoned by the pope and given command of papal troops.Power And Religion in Baroque Rome: Barberini Cultural Policies by P. J. A. N. Rietbergen (Brill, 2006) ==First War of Castro== On 12 October, Luigi Mattei led 12,000 infantry and up to 4,000 cavalry against the fortified town.The Castro Wars by Paul Armas Lepisto (Olive University) The pope's forces were met by a contingent of 40 troops guarding a bridge leading to the town; a short burst of cannon-fire resulting in a single death was enough to prompt capitulation. Castro, and several other small towns nearby, surrendered. Fabrizio Savelli, though, proved to be an unenthusiastic commander. The army was split into three and the Pope's nephew, Taddeo Barberini, replaced Savelli as Generalissimo, arriving with one contingent in the papal city of Ferrara on 5 January 1642. On 11 January the opera L'Armida, by Barberini house composer Marco Marazzoli, was presented in his honour and Marazzoli composed a work Le pretensioni del Tebro e del Po to commemorate recent events. On 13 January, Urban excommunicated Odoardo and rescinded his fiefdoms (which had been granted by Pope Paul III ‚Äì Odoardo's great-great- great-grandfather ‚Äì in 1545). Odoardo countered with a military march of his own, this time on the papal state itself and his forces were soon close enough to threaten Rome. But Odoardo faltered and the Pope was able to fortify Rome and raise a new army - this time 30,000 troops; enough to drive the Duke back to his own territory. Odoardo forged alliances with the Venice, Modena, and Tuscany which was under the command of his brother-in-law, Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. At first, Pope Urban threatened to excommunicate anyone who helped Odoardo, but Odoardo's allies insisted their conflict was not with the papacy, but rather with the Barberini family (of which the Pope happened to be a member). When this failed, the Pope attempted to call on old alliances of his own and turned to Spain for assistance. But he received little help as Spanish forces were fully occupied by the Thirty Years' War. As it was, most of the troops fighting on the side of the papacy were French, most of those fighting for the Dukes were German. Exasperated, the Pope increased taxes and raised additional forces and the war continued with Cardinal Antonio Barberini (Taddeo's brother) finding success against the Venetians and Modenese. But Papal forces suffered significant defeats in the area around Lake Trasimeno at the hands of the Tuscans (the Battle of Mongiovino). Fighting in the style typical of 17th-century Europe, by the latter half of 1643 neither side had made significant ground, though both sides had spent significant amounts of money perpetuating the conflict. It has been suggested that Pope Urban and forces loyal to the Barberini spent some 6 million thalers''The Thirty Years' War'' by Geoffrey Parker (Routledge, 1997) during the 4 years of the conflict that fell within Pope Urban's reign. The papal forces suffered a crucial defeat at the Battle of Lagoscuro on 17 March 1644 and were forced to surrender. Antonio Barberini was almost captured; saved, \\"only by the fleetness of his horse\\". Peace was agreed to in Ferrara on 31 March. Under the terms of the peace, Odoardo was readmitted to the Catholic Church and his fiefdoms were restored to him. Grain shipments from Castro to Rome were once again allowed and Odoardo was to resume payments to his Roman creditors. This peace settlement concluded the First War of Castro and was widely considered a disgrace to the papacy, which was unable to impose its will through use of military force. Urban is said to have been so distressed that after signing the peace agreements he was overcome by a severe malady which stayed with him until his death. ===Urban's death and Barberini exile=== Pope Urban VIII died just a few months after the peace settlement was agreed to, on 29 July and on 15 September Pamphili family Pope Innocent X was elected to replace him. Almost immediately, Innocent X began an investigation into the financing of the conflict. In total, the first war is estimated to have cost the papacy 12 million scudi and special taxes were levied against the residents of Rome to refill church coffers. The nephews of Pope Urban VIII who had led the papal armies, brothers Antonio Barberini (Antonio the Younger), Taddeo Barberini and Francesco Barberini, were forced to abandon Rome and flee to France, assisted by Cardinal Mazarin.The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church by S. Miranda (Florida International University, 2003) There they depended on the hospitality of Louis XIV, King of France. Taddeo Barberini died in Paris in 1647 but in 1653 Antonio and Francesco Barberini were allowed to return to Rome after sealing a reconciliation with Innocent X through the marriage of Taddeo's son Maffeo Barberini and Olimpia Giustiniani (a niece of Innocent X). Relations were also later repaired with some of Odoardo's former allies when Taddeo's daughter, Lucrezia Barberini married Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena who had led Modenese forces against the Barberini. ==Second War of Castro== Pope Innocent X, on whose orders Castro was destroyed. Portrait by Diego Vel√°zquez. With peace agreed to and with Barberini power-brokers dead or exiled, the citizens of Castro were left alone. But Odoardo Farnese, who had signed the original peace accord, died in 1646 and was succeeded by his son Ranuccio II Farnese, Duke of Parma. In 1649, Ranuccio refused to pay Roman creditors as his father had agreed in the treaty signed five years prior. He also refused to recognize the new bishop of Castro, Monsignor Cristoforo Giarda, appointed by Pope Innocent X. When the bishop was killed en route to Castro, near Monterosi, Pope Innocent X accused Duke Ranuccio, and his supporters, of murdering him. In retaliation for this alleged crime, forces loyal to the Pope marched on Castro. Ranuccio attempted to ride out against the Pope's forces but was routed by Luigi Mattei.''Cours d'histoire des √©tats europ√©ens depuis le bouleversement de l'Empire'' by Maximilian Samson Friedrich Schoell. Books.google.com.au. Retrieved on 2 September 2011. On 2 September, on the Pope's orders, the city was completely destroyed. Not only did Pope Innocent's troops destroy the fortifications and general buildings of Castro, they destroyed the churches as well so as to completely sever all links between the city and the papacy.Venice, Austria and the Turks in the seventeenth century by Kenneth Meyer Setton (American Philosophical Society, 1991) As a final insult, the troops destroyed Duke Ranuccio's family Palazzo Farnese and erected a column reading Qu√¨ fu Castro (\\"Here stood Castro\\"). Duke Ranuccio II was forced to cede control of the territories around Castro to the pope, who then attempted to use the land to settle debts with the Ranuccio's creditors. This marked the end of the Second War of Castro and the end of Castro itself ‚Äì the city was never rebuilt. ==References== Category:1640s conflicts Castro Castro Category:Barberini family Category:Pamphili family Category:1639 in Italy Category:1649 in Italy Category:1630s in Italy Category:1640s in Italy Category:1640s in the Papal States Category:Duchy of Castro ru:–ì–µ—Ä—Ü–æ–≥—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ö–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ ","title":"Wars of Castro"},{"id":"1425827","text":"Robert Lynn Welch (November 3, 1956 ‚Äì June 9, 2014) was an American professional baseball starting pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers (1978‚Äì87) and Oakland Athletics (1988‚Äì94). Prior to his professional career, he attended Eastern Michigan University, where he played college baseball for the Eastern Michigan Hurons baseball team.Schudel, Matt (June 11, 2014) \\"Pitcher won Cy Young Award in '90\\" The Washington Post, page B5. Retrieved July 6, 2014 He helped lead the Hurons, coached by Ron Oestrike, to the 1976 College World Series, losing to Arizona in the Championship Game. Welch was a two-time MLB All-Star, and he won the American League Cy Young Award as the league's best pitcher in 1990. He was a three-time World Series champion - twice as a player and once as a coach. He is the last pitcher to win at least 25 games in a single season (27 in 1990). ==Playing career== In a 17-year career, Welch compiled a 211‚Äì146 record with 1,969 strikeouts and a 3.47 ERA in 3,092 innings. His 137 wins during the 1980s was third among major league pitchers during that decade, following Jack Morris and Dave Stieb. He won the American League Cy Young Award in 1990 while playing for the Oakland Athletics. He threw two complete games in 1990, both of them shutouts. He finished in the top 10 voting for the National League Cy Young Award twice (1983 and 1987). ===Los Angeles Dodgers=== Welch gained national fame with Los Angeles in 1978, when as a 21-year-old rookie he struck out Reggie Jackson with two men on base and two out in the top of the ninth inning of Game 2 of the 1978 World Series against the New York Yankees. On May 29, 1980, Welch pitched a 3‚Äì0 one-hitter against the Atlanta Braves, facing the minimum 27 batters. The only Atlanta base runner was Larvell Blanks, who singled in the 4th inning and was retired on a double play. Welch won his first World Series in 1981 with the Los Angeles Dodgers after they defeated the New York Yankees in six games. In 1983 he threw a complete game shutout and hit a solo home run for his team's only run. This wouldn't happen again until Noah Syndergaard did it in 2019. ===Oakland Athletics=== 1990 Oakland Athletics #35 Bob Welch All-Star Game road jersey Welch was the third starting pitcher in the rotation for the 1989 World Series champion Oakland A's, compiling a regular-season record of 17-8 and recording a win in his only start in the American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays. In an odd twist of fate, however, Welch did not throw a single pitch against the San Francisco Giants during the World Series itself. Just minutes before Welch was to take the mound in Game 3, Candlestick Park and the Bay Area were struck by the Loma Prieta earthquake, which caused extensive damage in the region and forced the postponement of the game. When the Series was resumed 11 days later, A's manager Tony La Russa opted to re-use his Game 1 starter, Dave Stewart, for Game 3 in place of Welch, and his Game 2 starter, Mike Moore, for Game 4 in place of originally scheduled starter Storm Davis. The strategy worked, as the A's swept the Series in four games giving him his second World Series. A two-time All-Star (1980 and 1990), Welch won 14 or more games in eight years, with a career-high 27 in 1990. He received the Cy Young Award that season, and was considered in the MVP vote. His 27 wins were the most by any pitcher since Steve Carlton also won 27 in , and currently stands as the last time a pitcher has won 25 or more games in a season (the closest anyone has come to that mark since is 24, accomplished by John Smoltz in 1996, Randy Johnson in 2002, and Justin Verlander in 2011). The last pitcher to win more games in a season was Denny McLain, with 31 wins in . 19 of his wins were saved by Dennis Eckersley, which remains a record. Welch was the starting pitcher of Game 2 of the 1990 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Welch's personal catcher throughout much of his Oakland Athletics career was Ron Hassey, as opposed to Terry Steinbach, who caught the majority of the Oakland pitching staff. ===Autobiography and alcoholism=== In 1991, Welch and The New York Times sports columnist George Vecsey co-wrote Five O'Clock Comes Early: A Cy Young Award-Winner Recounts His Greatest Victory, which chronicled Welch's battle with alcoholism that he said started at the age of sixteen: \\"I would get a buzz on and I would stop being afraid of girls. I was shy, but with a couple of beers in me, it was all right.\\" The book \\"...marked one of the first times an active professional athlete openly discussed a drinking addiction.\\" An updated version was published after Welch's retirement, and the book was rereleased digitally on November 10, 2015. ==Retirement== Welch was the pitching coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks when they won the World Series in 2001. During the 2006 World Baseball Classic, Welch served as the pitching coach for The Netherlands. Welch was a pitching coach in the Oakland Athletics organization at the time of his death. His son Riley Welch was a 34th round selection by the Oakland A's in the 2008 MLB draft out of Desert Mountain high school in Scottsdale, Arizona but did not sign and went on to play college baseball at the University of Hawaii. Riley then signed as an undrafted free agent with the Dodgers. He became a pitching coach at Presentation College, an NAIA school in Aberdeen, South Dakota in 2014. ==Death== Welch died of a broken neck resulting from an accidental fall in the bathroom of his Seal Beach, California home on June 9, 2014 at the age of 57. The Orange County Coroner's Office (California) ruled that Welch suffered a cervical spine fracture \\"with epidural hemorrhage due to hyperextension of neck\\" suffered in the fall, negating earlier reports that he had died from a heart attack. ==Highlights== *American League Cy Young Award (1990) *Two-time All-Star (1980, 1990) *Led league in wins (27, 1990) *Led league in shutouts (4, 1987) *Led league in games started (35, 1991) *Tied at #84 on the all-time wins leaderboard *Third most wins in MLB in the 1980s ==Publications== * ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball career wins leaders * List of Major League Baseball annual wins leaders * List of Major League Baseball career strikeout leaders == References == ==External links== *(profile) Baseball Library Category:Cy Young Award winners Category:National League All-Stars Category:American League All-Stars Category:American League wins champions Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players Category:Oakland Athletics players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Baseball players from Michigan Category:Major League Baseball pitching coaches Category:1956 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Detroit Category:Sportspeople from Los Angeles Category:Eastern Michigan Eagles baseball players Category:San Antonio Dodgers players Category:Albuquerque Dukes players Category:Vero Beach Dodgers players Category:Arizona Diamondbacks coaches Category:Accidental deaths from falls Category:Accidental deaths in California ","title":"Bob Welch (baseball)"},{"id":"1425830","text":"√âtienne Jules Marey around 1880, by F√©lix Nadar. √âtienne-Jules Marey (; 5 March 1830, Beaune, C√¥te-d'Or ‚Äì 15 May 1904, Paris) was a French scientist, physiologist and chronophotographer. His work was significant in the development of cardiology, physical instrumentation, aviation, cinematography and the science of laboratory photography. He is widely considered to be a pioneer of photography and an influential pioneer of the history of cinema. He was also a pioneer in establishing a variety of graphical techniques for the display and interpretation of quantitative data from physiological measurement. ==Biography== Flying pelican captured by Marey around 1882. He found a way to record several phases of movements in one photo A galloping horse Sketches from the photography Marey started by studying blood circulation in the human body. Then he shifted to analyzing heart beats, respiration, muscles (myography), and movement of the body. To aid his studies he developed many instruments for precise measurements. For example, in 1859, in collaboration with the physiologist Auguste Chauveau and the watch manufacturer Breguet, he developed a wearable Sphygmograph to measure the pulse. This sphygmograph was an improvement on an earlier and more cumbersome design by the German physiologist Karl von Vierordt.Braun, Marta, 1992, Picturing Time: The Work of Etienne-Jules Marey, University of Chicago Press, Chicago In 1869 Marey constructed a very delicate artificial insect to show how an insect flies and to demonstrate the figure-8 shape it produced during movement of its wings. He fixed a gold foil to an insect wing and shone light on it to study the flapping of the wing. He also used a soot covered glass- fibre introduced along the path of the insect wing to determine if it crossed with the wing in the upper stroke or lower stroke by examining the side on which the soot was cleared. Then he became fascinated by movements of air and started to study bigger flying animals, like birds. He adopted and further developed animated photography into a separate field of chronophotography in the 1880s. His revolutionary idea was to record several phases of movement on one photographic surface. In 1890 he published a substantial volume entitled Le Vol des Oiseaux (The Flight of Birds), richly illustrated with photographs, drawings, and diagrams. He also created stunningly precise sculptures of various flying birds. Marey studied other animals too. He published La Machine animale in 1873 (translated as \\"Animal Mechanism\\"). The English photographer Eadweard Muybridge carried out his \\"Photographic Investigation\\" in Palo Alto, California, to prove that Marey was right when he wrote that a galloping horse for a brief moment had all four hooves off the ground. Muybridge published his photos in 1879 and received some public attention. Marey hoped to merge anatomy and physiology. To better understand his chronophotographic images, he compared them with images of the anatomy, skeleton, joints, and muscles of the same species. Marey produced a series of drawings showing a horse trotting and galloping, first in the flesh and then as a skeleton. The presence and activity of Marey in Naples is well documented,(IT) √âtienne-Jules Marey nell‚ÄôArchivio Storico della Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn di Napoli in particular thanks to the documentation preserved in the historical archive of the Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn. Marey began to travel to Naples presumably because of his relation with madame Vilbort, wife of Joseph Vilbort, the director of the French journal Le Globe. Madame Vilbort moved to Naples to cure her illness, thanks to the warm climate, and Marey followed her. Marey and madame Vilbort bought villa Maria in Posillipo in 1880. Marey accomplished in Naples part of his studies aimed at the realization of his pre- cinematographic tools and in the Dohrn zoological station studied the movement of fishes hosted in the aquarium's tanks. In a letter dated 1 November 1876 Marey requested the Stazione Zoologica to provide live ray fishes for his studies. Among the documentation that witnesses the collaboration of Marey with Anton Dohrn is the archive at the zoological station which preserves photos where the two appear together during an excursion and show Marey on board Dohrn's boat. The usage of the chronophotographic gun, which Marey used to aim at birds, but without shooting, appeared unusual to local people who referred to Maray sometimes as the \\"silly from Posillipo\\" (\\"lo scemo di Posillipo\\").(IT) Laurent Mannoni, La grande arte della luce e dell'ombra. Archeologia del cinema, Lindau 1994‚Äì2007, , (IT) Virgilio Tosi Il cinema prima del cinema, Il castoro, 2007, ==Chronophotography== Marey's chronophotographic gun was made in 1882, this instrument was capable of taking 12 consecutive frames a second, with all the frames recorded on the same picture. Using these pictures he studied horses, birds, dogs, sheep, donkeys, elephants, fish, microscopic creatures, molluscs, insects, reptiles, etc. Some call it Marey's \\"animated zoo\\". Marey also conducted the famous study about cats always landing on their feet. He conducted very similar studies with a chicken and a dog and found that they could do almost the same. Marey also studied human locomotion. He published another book Le Mouvement in 1894. Marey also made movies. They were at a high speed (60 images per second) and of excellent image quality. His research on how to capture and display moving images helped the emerging field of cinematography. Towards the end of his life he returned to studying the movement of quite abstract forms, like a falling ball. His last great work was the observation and photography of smoke trails. This research was partially funded by Samuel Pierpont Langley under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, after the two met in Paris at the Exposition Universelle (1900). In 1901 he was able to build a smoke machine with 58 smoke trails. It became one of the first aerodynamic wind tunnels. ==Bibliography== Marey among his inventions (sphygmograph, sound-recording instruments, model of bird-flight, projector, camera) * Physiologie m√©dicale de la circulation du sang (1863) (Physiology of blood circulation.) * √âtudes physiologiques sur les caract√®res graphiques des battements du c≈ìur (1865) (Physiological studies on the graphic characteristics of heartbeats.) * Du mouvement dans les fonctions de la vie (Movement in the functions of life.) ** Experiments done in his private laboratory ‚Äì La Revue scientifique (1866) ** Experiments done at Coll√®ge de France ‚Äì Germer-Bailli√®re (1868) * Du vol des oiseaux (The flight of birds), La Revue scientifique 14, 21 August 11 September and 2 October 1869 (Text on line) * La Machine animale.

The Organic Crop Improvement Association (OCIA) is a member- owned, non-profit organization, which provides research, education and certification services to organic growers, processors and handlers around the world. OCIA certifies and verifies farm, livestock, processor/handlers, broker-traders, Community Grower Groups (CGGs), and Private Labels to various programs. OCIA certifies operations to the OCIA International Certification Standard, USDA National Organic Program (NOP), Canada Organic Regime (COR), European Union Equivalent Standards (EU), Japanese Organic Agricultural Standards (JAS) and Quebec Organic Reference Standards (Quebec). OCIA verifies to JAS, the US-Canada Organic Equivalence Arrangement, Bio Suisse, Swiss Ordinance of Organic Farming, UTZ Certified, Smithsonian Bird Friendly and Shade-Grown Coffee (part of the OCIA International Certification Standard.) Bilingual organic certification seal.With its headquarters in Lincoln, Nebraska, OCIA has regional and chapter offices in Canada, Mexico, Nicaragua, Japan, Guatemala, Peru and the U.S. OCIA was founded in 1985 (incorporated in Pennsylvania 1988) near Sherbrooke, Quebec, by a group of farmers, modeled on the \\"crop improvement associations\\" that came out of the Dust Bowl era. These associations started as informal meetings where farmers could discuss and ask advice about their land. In the 1970s as the organic movement developed, \\"organic\\" crop improvement associations were formed. OCIA mandated that farmers would hold farmers to one of the first international organic standards in 1985. An international organization, OCIA continues to have a local approach with the organization largely being made up of local \\"chapters.\\" The organization had members primarily in Canada and the U.S. until a group of Peruvian farmers joined the organization in 1988. Expansion throughout Latin America continued, and now OCIA has members across the world. ==Controversies== ===Certification company spin offs=== OCIA grew the organic industry as new organic certification companies split off since its founding, including Global Organic Alliance, OneCert, TransCanada Organic Certification Services, and Quality Assurance International. ===Suspension in China=== OCIA was suspended from operating in China in 2010 for one year by the USDA after it reportedly used employees of a Chinese government agency to inspect state- controlled farms and food processing facilities, which constituted a conflict of interest. In China, OCIA had joined forces with the Organic Food Development Corporation, an agency affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection. The association kept a small staff ‚Äî one or three people in Nanjing ‚Äî while inspectors from the Chinese agency went out to farms and factories. Their findings were translated into English and sent to OCIA headquarters in Nebraska, where staff members reviewed the material and made the final decisions on certification. ==External links== * Organic Crop Improvement Association ==Notes and references== Category:Organic farming organizations Category:Organic farming in the United States Category:Product certification Category:Agriculture in Nebraska Category:Organizations based in Lincoln, Nebraska Category:Non-profit organizations based in Nebraska Category:Environmental organizations established in 1985 Category:1985 establishments in Nebraska Category:Agricultural organizations based in the United States ","title":"Organic Crop Improvement Association"},{"id":"1425862","text":"A tellurion (also spelled tellurian, tellurium, and yet another name is loxocosm), is a clock, typically of French or Swiss origin, surmounted by a mechanism that depicts how day, night, and the seasons are caused by the rotation and orientation of Earth on its axis and its orbit around the Sun.

The awards are named in tribute of Helen Hayes, known as the \\"First Lady of American Theatre.\\" They are presented by TheatreWashington (formerly known as the Helen Hayes Awards organization), sponsored by TodayTix, a ticketing company, and supported in part by the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities, The Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, The Max and Victoria Dreyfus Foundation, The Share Fund, Prince Charitable Trust, and Craig Pascal and Victor Shargai. ==History== In 1983, together with producing partner Arthur Cantor and Washington Post critic emeritus Richard L. Coe, Broadway producer Bonnie Nelson Schwartz presented a plan for strengthening and cultivating theatre in her home city, Washington, D.C., to the first lady of the American theatre and native Washingtonian, Helen Hayes, who embraced the idea. The Washington Theatre Awards Society was founded to recognize and encourage excellence in professional theatre in the Washington region through the presentation of the Helen Hayes Awards. The organization launched education and communication programs. The early success of the Helen Hayes Awards suggested that the organization do business under the name of its most visible program. Eventually, at the input of the theatre community and a wide range of stakeholders, the organization aimed to become more robust, and adopted the name \\"theatreWashington\\" to better reflect the breadth and geographic scope of its realigned activities. Due to criticism of the \\"one size fits all\\" philosophy of the awards, in September 2013 theatreWashington announced that, effective with the 2015 awards, the awards would be split into #The Helen Group of Awards for non-Equity productions defined to be those that have no more than three equity actors or the equity actors make up less than 51% of the cast. #The Hayes Group of Awards for productions employing too many equity actors to qualify for the Helen Group. These awards would be at the production level, not at the company level. ==Awards categories== With nearly 80 professional theatre companies, Washington, D. C., is second only to New York for the number of productions each year. During the 2011 season, 53 theatres produced 192 shows in the January 1 ‚Äì December 31 judging cycle. From these shows, 153 artists, ensembles, and productions from 26 theatres were nominated for Helen Hayes Awards, which are given for resident and nonresident productions.

Located on the eastern side of the \\"Future World\\" section of Epcot, the attraction used Disney's Omnimover conveyance system, which took guests past show scenes depicting visions of the future. It is believed to be the sequel to Walt Disney's Carousel of Progress, an attraction in Tomorrowland at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom. Horizons was the only attraction in \\"Future World\\" to showcase all of Epcot's \\"Future World\\" elements: communication, community interaction, energy, transportation, anatomy, physiology, along with humankind's relationship to the sea, land, air, and space. The attraction officially opened on October 1, 1983, as part of Phase II of Epcot. Horizons originally closed in December 1994, a little more than a year after General Electric had ended its sponsorship of the attraction. Horizons re-opened in December 1995 due to the closure of two other attractions that were down for refurbishment in \\"Future World\\", Universe of Energy and World of Motion. The attraction permanently closed on January 9, 1999, after which the attraction was dismantled and its structure demolished to make room for Mission: SPACE, a motion simulator thrill ride that opened on October 9, 2003. The attraction, although extinct, still retains a sizable cult following, especially among Disney park aficionados. ==Attraction== Horizons began with a section entitled \\"Looking Back at Tomorrow,\\" showcasing visions of the future as perceived from the era of Jules Verne and Albert Robida through the 1950s. The ride then moved past two immense OMNIMAX screens (groundbreaking technology at the time the ride was built), showing modern technologies and ideas that could be used to build the world of tomorrow. Afterward came the main part of the ride: visions of futuristic life in cities, deserts, undersea, and even in space. The only Disney attraction at the time with multiple endings, Horizons then allowed riders to select which path they wanted to take back to the FuturePort: from the space station Brava Centauri (depicting space colonization), from the desert farm of Mesa Verde (depicting arid-zone agriculture), or from the Sea Castle research base (depicting ocean colonization). As the final part of the ride, guests in their \\"omnimover\\" would push a button to select amongst the three choices and would be presented with a 31-second video sequence. A film would then be displayed to riders in each individual car. The videos showed a simulated flyover of an outdoor scene. To create the effect, scale models were built and a camera swept across the futuristic terrain. The models were some of the largest ever created at the time. The model for the desert sequence, for example, was long. The visual effects were filmed in a hangar at the Burbank airport. Produced in 1983 by 30 model makers, it took over a year to build and shoot the three segments.Choose Your Tomorrow model design http://www.kesigndesign.com/code/horizon1.shtml The exit corridor of the ride originally featured the mural The Prologue and the Promise by renowned space artist Robert T. McCall. ==History== Horizons, in its concept phase, was named Century 3 (or Century III), to recognize the third century of American existence (1976‚Äì2076). The name was changed to Futureprobe to help appeal the attraction toward international guests who wouldn't understand or appreciate Century 3. In the end, the Futureprobe name was scrapped due to the medical connotation of the word \\"probe\\". After much debate, GE and Disney officials settled on the name Horizons. Prior to the start of construction, the project's budget was slashed by $10 million (USD). The building size was reduced and the length of the ride was shrunk by 35%, shortening the ride length by . Horizons opened exactly one year after Epcot opened and was located between World of Motion and the Universe of Energy. The Wonders of Life pavilion became Horizons' new neighbor in 1989, and World of Motion closed in 1996. Horizons remained operational until World of Motion's successor, Test Track, was ready to open to the public in early 1999.Company officials say it is likely, but not yet certain, that Horizons will close for good when Test Track opens and will be replaced with a space pavilion. Horizons glass cased display. It was proposed that Horizons would be the sequel to the Carousel of Progress (located in Tomorrowland at Magic Kingdom), Disney's ride from the General Electric Pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair. As the Carousel of Progress followed the changes in lifestyle that faced a family as they lived through the 20th century, Horizons continued their story, showing how they might live in the 21st century. The Carousel's theme song \\"There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow\\" was part of the Looking Back at Tomorrow portion of Horizons. The version of \\"There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow\\" that could be heard in Horizons coming from a television (sung by Larry Cedar) in the Art Deco scene is the exact version that can still be heard on a radio during the first act of the present Carousel of Progress. The original ride concept came from Reginald Jones (then‚ÄìCEO of GE) and Jack Welch (future CEO of GE). The concept was to focus on Thomas Edison and his body of work along with the origin of General Electric; it was changed to focus on the future of America, a theme that changed yet again to respect that Epcot was to appeal to a global audience. The building which housed Horizons was designed to resemble a spaceship, while accentuating the third dimension and giving the impression of an infinite horizon. GE declined to renew sponsorship on September 30, 1993. Ideas were tossed around about the pavilion being turned into a space-themed pavilion. The building would have been upgraded and rethemed. The ride system would be changed drastically, in which the guest would be in an individual space harness while viewing space stations and space in general and would control the pitch and yaw of the vehicle. On January 9, 1999, Horizons closed permanently. No reason was publicly given, but the lack of corporate sponsorship, which happened around the same time of the financial disaster of Euro Disneyland is widely accepted as having played the largest part in the decision. Also widely speculated as a reason for the attraction closing was major structural problems, along with rumored problems with the roof. The building stood unoccupied for well over a year as Disney decided between either relaunching the attraction (which would have required a new storyline and major building renovation and upgrades) or demolishing the building and creating a new attraction in its place. It was decided to build a new cutting-edge outer space-themed attraction, so the Horizons building was slowly torn down in July 2000. The demolition of the building marked the first time in Disney history that an entire ride building had to be demolished in preparation for a new attraction. Construction on Mission: SPACE began in late 2000 and the new attraction opened in 2003. Various props from Horizons have been displayed around Walt Disney World and even in Walt Disney Studios Park at Disneyland Resort Paris. A display that features the butler robot animatronic was set up in EPCOT: Creating the World of Tomorrow for Epcot's 25th anniversary.EPCOT: Creating the World of Tomorrow https://www.flickr.com/photos/blm07/1471881269/ At Disney's Hollywood Studios, a few of the props from the underwater city scene are displayed in one of the studio warehouses.Disney MGM-Studios Backlot Tour: Horizons props https://www.flickr.com/photos/blm07/2112264230/ One of the Desert ships has made its way to Disney's Hollywood Studios, hanging from the ceiling of a restaurant.

This scene is the only post-show scene to be completely new in refurbishing Space Mountain. The flatscreen display in the new scene describes it as \\"20,000 Light Years under the Sea,\\" a pun on \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,\\" which is a reference to the defunct Magic Kingdom attraction 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: Submarine Voyage.Space Mountain soft-opens to guests with enhanced queue and video games ‚Äì Attractions Magazine *The robot butler and futuristic city skyline, which is the last post-show diorama, are similar to a scene in Horizons. ====Walt Disney: One Man's Dream==== Some of the props used in Horizons were once on display in the exhibition gallery before the film, including the famous robot butler. As of 2017, this is no longer the case, and it is unknown precisely when the pieces were removed. ===Tokyo Disneyland=== ====Star Tours - The Adventures Continue==== Located at the exit of Star Tours - The Adventures Continue at Tokyo Disneyland is a kiosk featuring video of 3 other Star Tours excursions.

It is widely considered to be a major information technology hub of South Asia. Named after the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, its main commercial district was built in the early 1980s and consists of several buildings, that flank a large pedestrian courtyard, built over underground parking. Although poorly maintained, most of the original structures are still in use. The Nehru Place market is open every day except Sundays. Due to higher rental shops, some shops and showrooms remain open on Sunday with a flea- market for clothes, computers, and mobile accessories. ==Location and accessibility== Nehru Place is accessible by all forms of public transport, as it lies next to the Outer Ring Road, an arc that encompasses major parts of South Delhi, and the bus services are very frequent, usually once every five to eight minutes. Private taxis are also available, as well as paid parking for cars and motorcycles. The famous Baha'i faith Lotus temple is also located close by. Now Nehru place is accessible by Delhi Metro. The nearest metro stations include Nehru Place, Kalkaji Mandir and Nehru Enclave. * Has its own Delhi-Metro Station on Violet Line (Kashmere Gate to Escorts Mujesar via Badarpur) * Has a second Metro Station by the name of Nehru Enclave on Magenta Line (Botanical garden-Janakpuri West) connecting commuters with shorter route from Gurgaon with interchange at Hauz Khas and directly connecting Noida and IGI Airport. * 30 minutes from Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station * 1 hr from New Delhi Railway Station * It has its own bus terminal, popularly known as Nehru Place Bus Terminal. ==Real estate== Office space and hotels are easily available around Nehru Place. Widely regarded as the center for small-scale IT services, Nehru Place is a hub for all forms of IT hardware, such as personal computers, servers, networking equipment, software, documentation services, and all allied services. Several manufacturers of computer hardware have their authorised dealerships located here, and as such, it is often considered as a computer enthusiasts' shopping area. Several businesses also build custom- specification personal computers and servers to order on-site, and many businesses are dedicated to hardware servicing. There are also firms that deal exclusively in used and second-hand computer hardware, as well as small, one- room shops that sell software titles. One can find some of the best deals for hardware here. One of the unique features of Nehru Place is the pervading informal atmosphere, akin to a flea market or a bazaar, in a place that deals in high-technology products. As such, a visitor may find pavement vendors selling items such as printer toner cartridges, blank optical media, printer paper, and even software from a small stall or cart. Bargaining is widely tolerated, even expected, as a large portion of the trading is done without proper documentation, such as cash receipts and bills, and it is possible to purchase items at a lower price than they are marked with. A vibrant informal economy has developed due to the abundance of illegally copied software available for sale, which has led to legal action against many organisations operating from Nehru Place. Other businesses that operate in the area are banks, multinational corporations, several restaurants, and even a multiplex. Several hotels are also available like Hotel Mint Casa. Intercontinental series of hotels has its own member hotel here as Eros Intercontinental. Surprisingly, the market also has been a hub for digital printing and photocopy services. The market houses around 20 large and small scale digital printers who contribute about INR 100 crore each year. The market is closed on Sunday, but the flea market is open seven days a week. ==Areas near Nehru Place== * Chirag Delhi * Nehru Enclave * Shaheen Bagh * East of Kailash * Greater Kailash * Sarita Vihar * Kailash Colony * Okhla * Kalkaji * Govindpuri * Jasola Vihar * Chittaranjan Park * Sant Nagar ==Other Areas In South Delhi== * Devli Village * Sangam Vihar * East of Kailash * Greater Kailash * Lajpat Nagar * Mehrauli * Malviya Nagar * Nehru Place * Chittaranjan Park * Saket * South Extension * Jaitpur * Dakshin puri ==Spiritual Places near Nehru Place== * Kalka Mandir * Lotus Temple * Prachin Bhairav Mandir * ISKCON Temple Delhi ==References== * https://www.nehruplacemarket.com/ * http://www.delhimetrorail.com/OtherDocuments/Route_Map.pdf * http://www.printweek.in/Gallery/338687,picture-gallery-nehru-place- decoded.aspx/1 Category:District Centres of Delhi Category:New Delhi Category:Shopping districts and streets in India Category:South Delhi district Category:Monuments and memorials to Jawaharlal Nehru ","title":"Nehru Place"},{"id":"1425916","text":"The Fulkerson Prize for outstanding papers in the area of discrete mathematics is sponsored jointly by the Mathematical Optimization Society (MOS) and the American Mathematical Society (AMS).

Skousen proposes that all or part of the first two chapters were lost with the 116 pages. Skousen notes that every other book in the Book of Mormon is named for its primary author; but the Book of Mosiah begins with King Benjamin and is not named for him. Also, Mosiah does not begin with an introduction of the author or an explanatory introduction as is typical with other Book of Mormon books but \\"begins in the middle of things.\\" Skousen speculates that the original first chapter related Mosiah's flight from the land of Nephi to Zarahemla and that the second chapter discussed King Benjamin's early reign and wars.. the first portion of the golden plates revealed to him by an angel in 1827. These pages, which had not been copied, were lost by Smith's scribe, Martin Harris, during the summer of 1828 and are presumed to have been destroyed. Smith completed the Book of Mormon without retranslating the Book of Lehi, replacing it with what he said was an abridgment taken from the Plates of Nephi.1 Nephi 1:17. == Background == Joseph Smith said that on September 22, 1827, he had recovered a set of buried golden plates in a prominent hill near his parents' farm in Manchester, New York. Martin Harris, a respectable but superstitiousA biographer of Harris wrote that his \\"imagination was excitable and fecund.\\" Harris once imagined that a sputtering candle was the work of the devil. He told a friend that he had met Jesus in the shape of a deer and walked and talked with him for two or three miles. (John A. Clark letter, August 31, 1840 in Early Mormon Documents, 2: 271.) The local Presbyterian minister called him \\"a visionary fanatic.\\" (Ronald W. Walker, \\"Martin Harris: Mormonism's Early Convert,\\" Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 19 (Winter 1986):34‚Äì35.) A friend, who praised Harris as \\"universally esteemed as an honest man,\\" also declared that Harris's mind \\"was overbalanced by 'marvellousness'\\" and that his belief in earthly visitations of angels and ghosts gave him the local reputation of being crazy. (Pomeroy Tucker reminiscence, 1858 in Early Mormon Documents 3: 71.) Another friend said, \\"Martin was a man that would do just as he agreed with you. But, he was a great man for seeing spooks.\\" (Lorenzo Saunders Interview, November 12, 1884, Early Mormon Documents 2: 149); . farmer from nearby Palmyra, became an early believer and gave Smith $50 to finance the translation of the plates.; ; ; . Lucy Harris, Martin's wife, also donated some of her own money and offered to give more, even though Smith denied her request to see the plates and told her that \\"in relation to assistance, I always prefer dealing with men rather than their wives.\\". Smith and his wife, Emma, moved to her hometown of Harmony, Pennsylvania, in late October 1827, where he began transcribing the writing on the plates.. When Harris left Palmyra to visit Smith without taking his wife along, she became suspicious that Smith intended to defraud her and her husband.. When Harris returned, Lucy refused to share his bed, and she had a suitor of her daughter surreptitiously copy the characters on the Anthon transcript that Smith had given to Harris.; Lucy then accompanied her husband back to Harmony in April 1828, when Martin agreed to serve as Smith's scribe.. Before returning home after two weeks, Lucy searched the Smith house and grounds for the plates but was unable to locate them. Smith said he did not need their physical presence to create the transcription; . and that they were hidden in nearby woods.; . ==Harris as Smith's scribe== From April to June 1828, Harris acted as Smith's scribe as Smith dictated the manuscript using the Urim and Thummim and seer stones.During this early period of translation, Harris said that Smith used a seer stone Smith had located in a well years earlier, or to a lesser extent, a pair of \\"spectacles\\" made of two seer stones that Smith called the Urim and Thummim, although Smith preferred the former out of convenience. . By the middle of June, Smith had dictated about 116 manuscript pages of text.Smith later called this book the \\"Book of Lehi\\", and he was the first to say that the number of missing pages was 116. ;. Harris continued to have doubts about the authenticity of the manuscript,Richard L. Bushman, Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005), 66: \\"Yet uncertainty still beset Harris.\\" and he \\"could not forget his wife's skepticism or the hostile queries of Palmyra's tavern crowd.\\" Smith's mother, Lucy, \\"said that Harris asked Joseph for a look at the plates, for 'a further witness of their actual existence and that he might be better able to give a reason for the hope that was within him.' When that request was denied, he asked about the manuscript. Could he at least take it home to reassure his wife?\\"Bushman, 66. After denying his request twice, Smith, with a great deal of uneasiness, said that the Lord had given permission, and he allowed Harris to take the manuscript pages back to Palmyra on condition that he show them to only five named family members. He even made Harris bind himself in a solemn oath.Bushman, 66; ; ; . ==The manuscript disappears== Martin Harris at age 87, more than forty years after he lost the manuscript. When Harris returned home, he showed the manuscript to his wife, who allowed him to lock them in her bureau. Harris then showed the pages not only to the named relatives but \\"to any friend who came along.\\"Bushman, 67. On one occasion Harris picked the lock of the bureau and damaged it, irritating his wife.Bushman, 67. Lucy Harris was described by Lucy Mack Smith as a woman of \\"irascible temper,\\" but Harris may also have abused her. Lucy Harris also suggested that her husband may have committed adultery with a neighboring \\"Mrs. Haggart.\\" \\"Lucy Harris statement,\\" in EMD, 2: 34-36: \\"In one of his fits of rage he struck me with the butt end of a whip, which I think had been used for driving oxen, and was about the size of my thumb, and three or four feet long. He beat me on the head four or five times, and the next day turned me out of doors twice, and beat me in a shameful manner....Whether the Mormon religion be true or false, I leave the world to judge, for its effects upon Martin Harris have been to make him more cross, turbulent and abusive to me.\\" In March 1830, a revelation from Smith warned Harris not to \\"covet thy neighbor's wife.\\" D&C; 19: 25. The manuscript then disappeared.According to Pomeroy Tucker (1802-1870), who was an acquaintance of the Harris family, Lucy Harris took the manuscript while Harris was asleep and burned it, keeping that fact a secret until after publication of the Book of Mormon. \\"A feud was thus produced between husband and wife, which was never reconciled.\\" ; also at EMD, 3: 11. A neighbor in Harmony said that prior to burning it, Lucy Harris hid the manuscript and told Smith to find it with his seer stone, but that Smith was unsuccessful . For other theories of what happened to the missing pages see Dan Vogel, Early Mormon Documents (Salt Lake City: Signature, 2000), 3: 480-81. Master forger Mark Hofmann may have been working on a forgery of the 116 pages before he was convicted of murder. See Allen D. Roberts, \\"'The Truth Is the Most Important Thing': The New Mormon History According to Mark Hofmann,\\" Dialogue 20 (1987), 89-90. Shortly after Harris left Harmony, Smith's wife gave birth to Smith's firstborn son, who was \\"very much deformed\\" and died less than a day after delivery.Sophia Lewis, 1834, quoted in EMD 4: 298. Lewis, who was present at the birth, said that the baby was stillborn. Emma Smith nearly died herself, and Smith tended her for two weeks. As she slowly gained strength, Smith left her in the care of her mother and went back to Palmyra in search of Harris and the manuscript.Bushman, 66-67; ; . The following day Harris was dragged into the Smith family home in distress and without the pages. Smith urged Harris to search his house again, but Harris told him he had already ripped open beds and pillows. Smith moaned, \\"Oh, my God! ... All is lost! all is lost! What shall I do? I have sinned--it is I who tempted the wrath of God\\".Bushman, 67; After returning to Harmony without Harris, Smith dictated to Emma his first written revelation,The revelation is today Doctrine and Covenants, section 3 (LDS Church ed.). which both rebuked Smith and denounced Harris as \\"a wicked man.\\". The revelation assured Smith that if he was penitent he would regain his ability to translate.Bushman, 68; ;D&C; 3:10-11 It is unclear if or when the angel returned the interpreters to Smith.Bushman, 578, n. 46. In 1838, Smith said, \\"Immediately after my return home [to Harmony, Pennsylvania, in about July,] I was walking out a little distance, when Behold the former heavenly messenger appeared and handed to me the Urim and Thummin.\\"Vogel, D. (2004). Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet.

(2004). Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet. Signature Books, p. 148.and David Whitmer and Emma Smith said that the interpreters were not returned at all but that Smith thereafter used one of his seer stones to interpret the plates.Bushman, 578, n. 46 ==Resumed transcription and the witnesses== Between the loss of the pages during the summer of 1828 and the rapid completion of the Book of Mormon in the spring of 1829, there was a period of quiescence as if Smith were waiting \\"for help or direction.\\"Bushman, pp.70-71. In April 1829, Smith was joined by Oliver Cowdery, a fellow Vermonter and a distant relation who replaced Harris as scribe.Early Mormon Documents, 1: 599-600, 604, n. 11. The pace of the transcription then increased so dramatically that, within two months, nearly the entire remainder of the manuscript of the Book of Mormon was completed.Bushman, p.73. According to Smith, he did not retranslate the material that Harris had lost because he said that if he did, evil men would alter the manuscript in an effort to discredit him. Smith said that instead, he had been divinely ordered to replace the lost material with Nephi's account of the same events.See D&C; 10: 17-18, 31 for Smith's description of the plans to alter the manuscript. (Nevertheless, \\"evil men\\" might also have altered the lost manuscript to contradict the new account as well,http://mormonthink.com/lost116web.htm as is evidenced by Mark Hofmann's supposed desire to do so.)Robert Lindsey, A Gathering of Saints (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1988), p.300. \\"It was possible, George thought, that Hofmann could have destroyed Mormonism. Perhaps that is what he wanted to do ‚Äî and to get rich at the same time.\\" When Smith reached the end of the book, he said he was told that God had foreseen the loss of the early manuscript and had prepared the same history in an abridged format that emphasized religious history, the Small Plates of Nephi.Bushman, p.74. The translated version of these \\"small plates\\" includes the books of 1 & 2 Nephi, Jacob, Enos, Jarom and Omni. The unabridged version, not retranslated, Smith called \\"The Book of Lehi.\\" Smith transcribed this portion, and it appears as the first part of the book. When published in 1830, the Book of Mormon contained a statement about the lost 116 pages, as well as the Testimony of Three Witnesses and the Testimony of Eight Witnesses, who claimed to have seen and handled the golden plates. The loss of the manuscript provided opponents of Mormonism, such as the 19th century clergyman M.T. Lamb, with additional reasons to dismiss the religion as a fraud. ‚Äì an early critical view of the lost manuscript problem. Lamb noted that the plates from which the 116 pages were translated had been preserved for 1,400 years by the special providence of God, but that a \\"wrathful woman\\" had undone His plans; neither God nor the angel stopped Smith from translating the wrong plates until Harris lost the manuscript; God scolded Smith for his loss of the manuscript, even though its loss was \\"the best thing that could have happened for the cause of truth.\\" Although Smith said that \\"evil men\\" would produce an altered manuscript if he were to translate the same part of the golden plates again, no such attempt has been uncovered. Nor did Smith ever announce what had become of the lost pages despite his followers' belief in his prophetic gift. Fawn Brodie has written that Smith \\"realized that it was impossible for him to reproduce the story exactly, and that to redictate it would be to invite devastating comparisons. Harris's wife taunted him: 'If this be a divine communication, the same being who revealed it to you can easily replace it.'\\"Fawn Brodie, No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet 2nd ed. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1986), p.54. Ex-Mormons Jerald and Sandra Tanner argued that the lost manuscript suggested that Smith was not a misguided individual who believed in his own creative imagination but was at least minimally aware of his own deception. According to Jeffrey R. Holland, an apostle in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), \\"it was not tit for tat, this for that ‚Äî you give me 116 pages of manuscript and I'll give you 142 pages of printed text. Not so: We got back more than we lost. And it was known from the beginning that it would be so.\\"\\"At least six times in the Book of Mormon the phrase 'for a wise purpose' is used in reference to the making, writing, and preserving of the small plates of Nephi (see 1 Nephi 9:5; Words of Mormon 1:7; Alma 37:2,12,14,18). We know one such wise purpose ‚Äî the most obvious one ‚Äî was to compensate for the lost 116 pages of manuscript. But it strikes me that there is a 'wiser purpose' than that. ... The key to such a suggestion is in verse 45 of Section 10\\\\. ... He says, 'Behold, there are many things engraven upon the [small] plates of Nephi which do throw greater views upon my gospel.' So clearly ... it was not tit for tat, this for that ‚Äî you give me 116 pages of manuscript and I'll give you 142 pages of printed text. Not so: We got back more than we lost. And it was known from the beginning that it would be so. We do not know exactly what we missed in the 116 pages, but we do know that what we received on the small plates was the personal declarations of three great witnesses, [Nephi, Jacob, and Isaiah], ... testifying that Jesus is the Christ. ... I think you could make a pretty obvious case that the sole purpose of the small plates was to give a platform for these three witnesses.\\" (CES Symposium, BYU, Aug. 9, 1994, quoted in Latter-day Commentary on the Book of Mormon compiled by K. Douglas Bassett, p. 198) Martin Harris was permitted by Smith to be one of the Three Witnesses. He mortgaged his farm for $3000 () as security in the event that the Book of Mormon did not sell, and when in fact, it did not, he lost both his farm and his wife.Bushman, 80. Lucy Harris swore (and had corroboration) that her husband intended to make money through his relationship to Smith and the Book of Mormon. EMD 2: p.35 He later disavowed Joseph Smith, left the church, joined several different varieties of early Mormon-related congregations, then at 87 joined the LDS Church and recanted what he'd earlier said about Smith. He never disavowed the gold plates, however. On his death bed, Harris said: ==See also== * \\"All About Mormons\\" * Mosiah priority == Notes == ==References== #.

It is one of the world's largest certifiers, operating in the United States, Canada, Latin America, European Union, and Japan. It is owned by public health and environmental organization NSF International. ==Organic certification== QAI offers organic certification under the National Organic Program for agricultural producers, food processing facilities, integrated manufacturing operations, contract packing operations, traders, distributors, retailers, and ultimately consumers. ==Gluten-free certification== QAI, in partnership with National Foundation for Celiac Awareness (NFCA), developed a science-based gluten-free certification program. The stringent nature of the QAI certification protocols ensures prevention of contamination and co-mingling, critically important for those with allergies to gluten and gluten-intolerance. The QAI and NFCA \\"Gluten-Free\\" certification program requires companies to produce products at less than 10 parts per million (ppm) of gluten to receive certification. The program includes: * Product review * Onsite inspection * Testing to ensure compliance to 10ppm or less * Ongoing compliance including random product testing ==Personal care certification== QAI certifies personal care products to the National Organic Program guidelines. Those products not meeting the NOP guidelines can be certified to the NSF/ANSI 305 Standard for Personal Care Products \\"Contains Organic Ingredients.\\" Under this program, products with a minimum organic content of 70 percent (070) that meet the requirements can make the organic label and marketing claim of \\"Contains Organic Ingredients.\\" These products can bear the unique NSF/ANSI 305 \\"Contains Organic Ingredients\\" mark, as well as the QAI \\"Choose Quality\\" mark. The Organic Trade Association considers certification to this standard a best practice. It is required by some retailers for personal care products that do not meet the National Organic Program standard for food. ==Kosher certification== QAI, in partnership with Star-K, provides a joint kosher and organic auditing program. Through rabbinical supervision products can be certified to both kosher certification requirements and to the USDA National Organic Program standards for organic certification. ==International organic certification== As an accredited certifying agent under the USDA's National Organic Program, QAI is also accredited by the USDA for ISO 65 compliance, the Japan Ministry of Agriculture Forestry for JAS (Japanese Agricultural Standard) compliance, and Le Conseil des appellations reserv√©es et des termes valorisants (CARTV). ==Food safety== QAI offers joint certification to the British Retail Consortium (BRC), Safe Quality Food (SQF) and FSSC 22000 global food safety standards, which is required by many retailers under the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). ==Environmental policy== QAI achieved ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems accreditation in June 2010. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard provides guidance on how to manage the environmental aspects of an organization's activities, products and services more efficiently. ISO 14001 focuses on reducing the environmental footprint, pollution and waste produced by businesses, which is consistent with QAI's mission to help support organic agriculture and protect the environment. ISO 14001 registration verifies that QAI has effective procedures in place to monitor and continuously improve its environmental performance. To obtain ISO 14001 registration, QAI reduced energy and raw material use; implemented a paperless documentation and billing management system; developed a recycling program for paper, plastic containers and bags, electronics, mercury-containing light bulbs and batteries; and instituted a composting program for coffee grounds, tea bags and fruit/vegetable food scraps. ==Accreditations== QAI holds the following accreditations: * United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) : National Organic Program (NOP) : ISO Guide 65 * International Organic Accreditation Service (IOAS) : European Recognition Programme (EU) : ISO Guide 65 : Canadian Organic Regime (COR) * Conseil des appellations reserv√©es et des termes valorisants (CARTV, Canada) * KEMA : ISO 14001 * JAS through our Japan-based, MAFF accredited partner EcoCert ==Partnerships== QAI works with other leading food safety and quality organizations.

It was developed in the 1890s in Lyon by Auguste and Louis Lumi√®re.This was not the first 'moving picture' device. Louis Le Prince had built early devices in 1886. His 1888 film Roundhay Garden Scene still survives. ==History== The Institut Lumi√®re in Lyon, France The device was invented and patented as the \\"Cin√©matographe L√©on Bouly\\" by French inventor L√©on Bouly on February 12, 1892. Bouly coined the term \\"cinematograph,\\" from the Greek for \\"writing in movement.\\"Abel, Richard. Encyclopedia of Early Cinema. 1st ed. London: Routledge, 2004. Due to a lack of money, Bouly could not develop his ideas properly and maintain his patent fees, so he sold his rights to the device and name to the Lumi√®re brothers.Cin√©ma des premiers temps: nouvelles contributions fran√ßaises par Michel Mari√©, Thierry Lefebvre, in collection Th√©or√®me (1996) In 1895, they applied the name to a device that was mostly their own invention. The Lumi√®re brothers made their first film, Workers Leaving the Lumi√®re Factory (Sortie de l'usine Lumi√®re de Lyon), that same year. The first commercial, public screening of cinematographic films happened on 28 December 1895 at Salon Indien du Grand Caf√© in Paris and was organised by the Lumi√®re brothers.Louis Lumi√®re, The Lumi√®re Cinematograph. In: This history-making presentation featured ten short films, including their first film, Workers Leaving the Lumiere Factory. Each of these early films is 17 meters long (approximately 56 feet), which, when hand cranked through a projector, runs approximately 50 seconds. The Cin√©matographe was also exhibited at the Paris Exposition of 1900. At the Exposition, films made by the Lumi√®re Brothers were projected onto a large screen measuring 16 by 21 meters (approximately 52.5 x 69 feet).Cinematograph, Louis Lumi√®re. ‚Äú1936 the Lumi√®re Cinematograph.‚Äù SMPTE Journal 105, no. 10 (October 1, 1996): 608‚Äì611. Several versions of cin√©matographes were developed, including ones by the inventor Robert Royou Beard (1856-1932),Who's Who of Victorian Cinema: Biography of Beard the electrical engineer Cecil Wray (1866-1944),Who's Who of Victorian Cinema: Biography of Wray the optician Alfred Wrench (?-?),Who's Who of Victorian Cinema: Biography of Wrench Georges Demen√ø and, of course, the Lumi√®re brothers. ==Invention== The Cin√©matographe Lumi√®re in projection mode The Cin√©matographe Lumi√®re at Institut Lumi√®re Louis Lumi√®re and his brother Auguste worked together to create a motion-picture camera superior to Thomas Edison's kinetograph, which did not have a projector. The Lumi√®res endeavored to correct the flaws they perceived in the kinetograph and the kinetoscope, to develop a machine with both sharper images and better illumination. The Cin√©matographe weighed only , which allowed for ease of transportation and placement. As well, the Cin√©matographe was manually operated by a hand-crank, as opposed to Edison's electrically powered camera, which was not readily portable. Furthermore, while only one person at a time could use Edison's kinetoscope for viewing‚Äîthrough an eyepiece, peep show style‚Äîthe Cin√©matographe could project an image onto a screen so a large audience of people could view images simultaneously.Gomery, Professor Douglas, and Clara Pafort-Overduin. Movie History: A Survey. Taylor & Francis, 2011. The Cin√©matographe produced a sharper projected image than had been seen before due to its design, in which a kind of fork held frames behind the lens in place using the perforations in the sides of the film strip. In 1897, the Lumi√®res further added to their invention by using a glass flask of water as the condenser to concentrate the light onto the film frame and to absorb heat. The flask also acted as a safety feature, as the light would no longer focus on the flammable film if the glass were to break due to overheating or accident. ==Popularity== After the success of the Lumi√®res's initial public screening in 1895, the Cin√©matographe became a popular attraction for people all over the world. The Lumi√®re brothers took their machine to China and India and it was enjoyed by people of all classes and social standings. The Cin√©matographe was used to show films in nickelodeons, where even the poorest classes could pay the entry fee. It was exhibited at fairs and used as entertainment in vaudeville houses in both Europe and the United States. While vaudeville is typically associated with the working and middle classes, the machine also found its way into more sophisticated venues, where it appealed to the artistic tastes of high society. ==See also== * Bioscop * Biograph * Electrotachyscope * Film * Image * Kinetoscope * List of film formats * Panoptikon * Pleograph * Praxinoscope * Vitascope * Zoopraxiscope == Notes == === Explanatory notes === === References === ==External links== * Adventures in Cybersound * * Category:Audiovisual introductions in 1895 Category:Auguste and Louis Lumi√®re Category:History of film ","title":"Cinematograph"},{"id":"1425941","text":"{ border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" width=\\"300\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"right\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\" bgcolor=\\"fffff\\"  Only You - ! colspan=\\"2\\"  (Èùû‰Ω†‰∏çÂèØ) 190px -  width=\\"150\\"  Mandarin Pinyin  width=\\"150\\"  Fei Ni Bu Ke -  width=\\"150\\"  Main Cast  width=\\"150\\"  Ruby Lin Chen Kun -  width=\\"150\\"  Production Date  width=\\"150\\"  2001 -  width=\\"150\\"  Year Release  width=\\"150\\"  2002 -  width=\\"150\\"  Genre  width=\\"150\\"  Fictional -  width=\\"150\\"  Episodes  width=\\"150\\"  20 } Only You (Èùû‰Ω†‰∏çÂèØ) is a Chinese series; The storyline surrounds an inevitable love triangle that unraveled during a Beijing summer.

He is the chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Kraft Group, a diversified holding company with assets in paper and packaging, sports and entertainment, real estate development and a private equity portfolio. He is the owner of the National Football League's New England Patriots, Major League Soccer's New England Revolution, and Gillette Stadium, where both teams play. He also owns the Boston Uprising, the first esports team in New England. ==Early life== Kraft was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, the son of Sarah Bryna (Webber) and Harry Kraft, a dress manufacturer in Boston's Chinatown. His mother was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia; his father was a lay leader at Congregation Kehillath Israel in Brookline and wanted his son to become a rabbi. The Krafts were a Modern Orthodox Jewish family. Robert attended the Edward Devotion SchoolNew York Times: \\"'Between You and Me'\\" By Mike Wallace with Gary Paul Gates January 22, 2006 and graduated from Brookline High School in 1959, where he was senior class president.Massachusetts Live: \\"For New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, an off-season of personal tragedy, professional triumph\\" By Howard Ulman September 6, 2011 During high school, he was unable to participate in most sports because it interfered with his after-school Hebrew studies and observance of the Sabbath. Kraft attended Columbia University where he served as class president. He played running back and safety on the school's freshman and lightweight football teams.\\"Robert Kraft to Be Inducted to Columbia University Athletics Hall of Fame\\" by Paige Allen June 18, 2012 He met Myra Hiatt at a delicatessen in Boston's Back Bay in 1962, and they married in June 1963. He graduated from Columbia that same year, and he received an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1965. Kraft was elected chairman of the Newton Democratic City Committee when he was 27. He considered running against Representative Philip J. Philbin in 1970 but chose not to, citing the loss of privacy and strain on his family that politics would have caused. He was further discouraged from entering politics by the suicide of his friend State Representative H. James Shea, Jr. ==Business career== Kraft began his professional career with the Rand-Whitney Group, a Worcester-based packaging company run by his father-in-law Jacob Hiatt. In 1968, he gained control of the company through a leveraged buyout. He still serves as this company's chairman. In 1972, he founded International Forest Products, a trader of physical paper commodities. The two combined companies make up the largest privately held paper and packaging companies in the United States. Kraft has stated that he started the company out of a hunch that the increase in international communications and transportation would lead to an expansion of global trade in the late twentieth century. International Forest Products became a top 100 US exporter/importer in 1997 and in 2013 was ranked No. 20 on the Journal of Commerce's list in that category.International Forest Products LLC website: \\"IFP ranked 27th among largest U.S. exporters and first among New England exporters\\" May 29, 2012 Kraft said of the business in 1991 that, \\"We do things for a number of companies, including Avon, Kodak, cosmetics companies, candies, toys.\\" The company produced both corrugated and folding cartons, which he stated, \\"are used to package everything from the Patriot missile, to mints, to Estee Lauder, Indiana Glass and Polaroid.\\" Kraft acquired interests in other areas, and ultimately formed the Kraft Group as an umbrella for them in 1998. Kraft was an investor in New England Television Corp., which gained control of WNAC-TV in 1982, and Kraft became a director of the board in 1983. The station then became WNEV-TV. In 1986, he was named president of the corporation. In 1991, Kraft exercised his option to unload his shares for an estimated $25 million. ==Sports teams== ===Boston Lobsters and early bids for sports teams=== In 1974, Kraft and five others purchased the Boston Lobsters of World TeamTennis (WTT). The group spent heavily to lure a number of top players, including Martina Navratilova, and the Lobsters became one of the best teams in WTT. Following the 1978 season, Kraft announced that the franchise would fold. The league itself folded soon thereafter. After the Lobsters folded, Kraft was also mentioned as a bidder for the Boston Red Sox and the Boston Celtics. ===New England Patriots=== Kraft has been a Patriots fan since their American Football League days and has been a season ticket holder since 1971 when the team moved to Schaefer Stadium. In 1985, he bought a 10-year option on Foxboro Raceway, a horse track adjacent to the stadium, and the purchase prevented Patriots owner Billy Sullivan from holding non-Patriot events at the stadium while races were being held. Kraft took advantage of the fact that the Sullivans owned the stadium but not the surrounding land, and it was the beginning of a quest to buy the stadium and the Patriots. Sullivan's family was reeling from a series of bad investments, principally The Jackson Five 1984 Victory Tour, for which they had to pledge Sullivan Stadium as collateral. Those problems ultimately forced Sullivan to sell controlling interest of the team in 1988, while the stadium lapsed into bankruptcy. In 1988, Kraft outbid several competitors to buy the stadium out of bankruptcy court from Sullivan for $22 million. The stadium was considered to be outdated and nearly worthless, but the purchase included the stadium's lease to the Patriots which ran through 2001. Kraft placed a bid on the Patriots franchise as well, but he lost the bidding to Victor Kiam. Sullivan and Kiam then tried to move the team to Jacksonville, but Kraft refused to let them break the lease. Kiam was nearly brought down by bad investments of his own and was forced to sell the Patriots to James Orthwein in 1992. In 1994, Orthwein offered Kraft $75 million to buy out the remainder of the team's lease at Foxboro Stadium, but Kraft turned it down. Orthwein was not interested in operating the team in New England and decided to sell it. Prospective buyers had to deal with Kraft, however, due to terms in the operating covenant, and he offered $172 million for an outright purchase which Orthwein accepted. It was the highest price ever paid for an NFL team at the time. While future St. Louis/Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke had actually offered more money ($200 million), Orthwein would have had to bear all of the team's relocation expenses. Orthwein would have also been responsible for paying the costs of an all-but-certain legal battle over the lease, as Kraft let it be known that he would go to court to enforce the covenant. Kraft said that his passion for the Patriots led him to \\"break every one of my financial rules\\" in his pursuit of the team. He still keeps a Victory Tour poster in his office as a reminder of what set in motion the events that allowed him to buy the Patriots. Following the NFL's approval of the sale, the Patriots sold out their entire 1994 season, the first full sell-out in franchise history, and every home game has been sold out ever since, including pre-season, regular season, and playoffs. In 1998, Kraft considered moving the Patriots to Hartford, Connecticut based on an offer that the state of Connecticut would finance a new stadium, but he terminated the deal just before it became binding to instead build a new stadium in Foxboro with Massachusetts infrastructure funding. In 2002, Kraft financed a $350-million stadium for the Patriots initially called CMGI Field but renamed Gillette Stadium. In 2007, Kraft began to develop the land around Gillette Stadium, creating a $375-million open-air shopping and entertainment center called Patriot Place. The development included \\"The Hall at Patriot Place presented by Raytheon,\\" a multi-story museum and hall of fame attached to the stadium, and the \\"CBS Scene,\\" a CBS-themed restaurant. Under Kraft's ownership, the Patriots experienced sustained success. While they appeared in Super Bowl XX under the Sullivans, this was one of only six playoff appearances in 34 years. However, they have made the playoffs 19 times in 24 years since Kraft purchased them. They have won 19 AFC East titles, including all but two since 2001 and 11 in a row since 2009. They represented the AFC in the Super Bowl in 1996 (lost), 2001 (won), 2003 (won), 2004 (won), 2007 (lost), 2011 (lost), 2014 (won), 2016 (won), 2017 (lost) and 2018 (won). After having never won more than 11 games prior to Kraft's arrival, the Patriots have won at least 12 games 13 times, including finishing the 2007 regular season undefeated before losing to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII. Indianapolis Colts center Jeff Saturday said of Kraft, \\"He is a man who helped us save football.\\"Reiss, Mike, \\"Saturday: Kraft helped save football\\", July 25, 2011, ESPNBoston.com In 2005, Kraft gave Russian President Vladimir Putin one of his three Super Bowl rings out of \\"respect and admiration\\" for the Russian people and Putin's leadership. Kraft later said that his earlier statement was not true and had been issued under pressure from the White House. The ring is on display with state gifts at the Kremlin. ===Soccer=== In 1996, Kraft founded the New England Revolution, a charter member of Major League Soccer which began playing alongside the Patriots at Foxboro Stadium. Kraft also owned the San Jose Clash (later San Jose Earthquakes) from 1998 to 2000. In November 2005, Kraft met with Rick Parry, the Chief Executive of English Premier League team Liverpool. Kraft was rumored to be interested in investing money into the 2004‚Äì05 Champions League winners. Kraft told BBC Radio 5 Live: \\"Liverpool is a great brand and it's something our family respects a lot. We're always interested in opportunities and growing, so you never know what can happen.\\" Eventually, however, the club was sold to American duo George Gillett and Tom Hicks. Liverpool is now owned by Fenway Sports Group, owners of fellow Boston-based sport team the Boston Red Sox. In October 2017, Kraft said he was \\"still intrigued\\" by the possibility of buying a Premier League football club, but that he was concerned about the lack of a salary cap in British football. In 2017, Kraft was named the Honorary Chairman of the Board of Directors for the successful joint Canadian-Mexican-American bid for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. ===Esports=== Blizzard Entertainment announced in July 2017 that Kraft bought ownership in the Boston Uprising, one of the first seven teams for the professional esports Overwatch League. They played in Season 1 of the Overwatch League. Preseason for the league began December 6, 2017, and the regular season started on January 10, 2018. Boston Uprising finished third in the Overwatch League's inaugural season. ==Philanthropy== The Krafts have donated hundreds of millions of dollars to a variety of philanthropic causes including education, child- and women-related issues, healthcare, youth sports and American and Israeli causes. === Israel and Jewish causes === One of their most distinctive projects is supporting American Football Israel, including Kraft Family Stadium in Jerusalem and the Kraft Family Israel Football League. In 2017, Kraft announced a contribution of $6 million to build the first ever regulation size American football field in Israel. In June 2017, Robert Kraft, along with several NFL Hall of Famers, traveled to Israel for the grand opening of the new Kraft Family Sports Campus. In December 2018, following Pittsburgh synagogue shooting at Tree of Life, Kraft visited the synagogue to pay his respects and attended services with the congregation before the Patriots played the Steelers in a game the next day. In 2000, Kraft donated $11.5 million to construct the Columbia/Hillel which is made of the same white stone used in Jerusalem. ==== Combatting the boycotts against Israel ==== In June 2019, Kraft received Israel's prestigious Genesis Prize, a $1 million award granted to an individual who is committed to Jewish values and is an inspiration to the next generation of Jews. At the Jerusalem event, Kraft pledged $20 million to establish a foundation that will fight antisemitism and combat the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against Israel, also known as BDS. === Education === In 1990, Kraft, his wife, and his father-in- law funded a joint professorship between Brandeis University and Holy Cross College, forming the Kraft-Hiatt endowed chairs in comparative religion ‚Äì the first inter-religious endowed chairs in the United States. Among the many institutions the Krafts have supported are Columbia University, Harvard Business School, Brandeis University, The College of the Holy Cross, Boston College, Tufts University, Yeshiva University, the Belmont Hill School, and the Boys & Girls Clubs of Boston. In 2007, in recognition of a gift of $5 million in support of Columbia's intercollegiate athletics program, the playing field at Columbia's Lawrence A. Wien Stadium at the Baker Field Athletics Complex was named Robert K. Kraft Field. === Healthcare === In 2011, the Krafts pledged $20 million to Partners HealthCare to launch the Kraft Family National Center for Leadership and Training in Community Health, an initiative designed to improve access to quality healthcare at community health centers throughout New England. The Krafts supported the Dana‚ÄìFarber Cancer Institute in Boston. Following the Boston Marathon bombing, Kraft announced he would match up to $100,000 in donations made for the victims through the New England Patriots Charitable Foundation. In 2017, Kraft funded a new van as part of the Kraft Center for Community Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in order to help combat the opioid crisis in Boston. The vans allows those struggling with opioid addiction to seek health services in their own neighborhood. In 2020, Kraft partnered with Chinese company Tencent to purchase over one million N95 masks to donate to medical workers in New York and Massachusetts to help combat the coronavirus pandemic, sending the New England Patriots' private team plane to China to deliver the supplies.https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-million-n95-masks-are-coming-from- chinaon-board-the-new-england-patriots-plane-11585821600 Kraft initially negotiated for 1.7 million masks, but only 1.2 million fit on board. They were allowed only three hours on the ground in China at Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport. Using the New England Patriots truck, they distributed 300,000 masks in New York City, 900,000 masks in Massachusetts and 100,000 in Rhode Island. === Miscellaneous === In 2019, Kraft teamed with recording artists Jay-Z and Meek Mill, as well as Michael Rubin, the executive chairman of Fanatics, among others to announce a foundation of criminal justice reform called REFORM Alliance https://reformalliance.com/. In coordination with the REFORM Alliance, Kraft spread some holiday cheer on Dec. 21, 2019 by flying more than 50 children (ages 5‚Äì17) on the Patriots' team charter to attend the Patriots game against the Buffalo Bills at Gillette Stadium. The children attending the game each had parents who have been incarcerated for technical probation violations. Kraft donated $20,000 and attended the memorial in Worcester to honor fallen firefighter Christopher Roy on the one-year anniversary of his death. In May 2020, Kraft put his Super Bowl LI ring up for auction with proceeds designated to help feed those facing food insecurity as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. On July 13, 2019, Kraft pledged $100,000 to the families of seven motorcyclists killed in a crash the month before. \\"Kraft joined thousands of bikers at a memorial event for the victims outside Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. and pledged to donate the money to a GoFundMe page set up to assist the victims' families. All seven of those killed in the June 21 crash were members or supporters of the Jarheads, a New England motorcycle club that includes Marines and their spouses. 'The Jarheads are what makes America the greatest,' Kraft told the crowd. 'We are all Patriots and you are the true patriots.'\\" ==Personal life== ===Family=== In June 1963, Kraft married Myra Nathalie Hiatt, a 1964 graduate of Brandeis University and the daughter of the late Worcester, Massachusetts, businessman and philanthropist Jacob Hiatt. She died due to ovarian cancer, aged 68, on July 20, 2011. The Krafts were members of Temple Emanuel in Newton, Massachusetts.Gershman, Andrew (January 23, 2012). \\"Bob Kraft: New England Patriots'Jewish owner\\". The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles.

In the video, Kraft reads Wilson's lines for a bikini-clad Lander, dances briefly, curses, and throws a punch at another actor. After an anonymously supplied copy of the video was hosted on the Barstool Sports website, it went viral and became a subject of commentary on late night television. In a statement, Kraft said, \\"I tried to help Ricki prepare an audition tape ... I never intended that it would be made public and I regret that it has.

While there was speculation that Kraft was the father, he denied paternity of the child when the birth was announced in May 2018. Kraft and Lander broke up in 2018. ===2019 solicitation charges=== On February 22, 2019, the police chief of Jupiter, Florida, announced that Kraft would face two misdemeanor charges for \\"soliciting another to commit prostitution\\", stemming from a human trafficking sweep in Jupiter. Investigators suspected the managers at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa, where Kraft was allegedly video recorded in sexual activity, were sex trafficking women, forcing the women to perform sex acts on clients. Deputies had begun to monitor the day spas, and were able to place hidden cameras inside the facility. They claim Kraft was caught on camera \\"receiving the alleged acts\\" (believed to be oral sex), according to the lead investigator. A spokesperson for Kraft issued a statement to \\"categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity.\\" On February 25, Dave Aronberg, state attorney for Palm Beach County, announced that Kraft was among 25 people facing first-degree misdemeanor charges for soliciting prostitution at the Jupiter day spa. The next day, Kraft's attorney electronically entered a not guilty plea in Palm Beach County. Kraft has assembled a legal \\"dream team\\" to provide his defense, namely Alex Spiro, William Burck, and Jeffrey Goldberger. On March 19, men arrested in the sting operation, including Kraft, were offered a plea deal that would require 100 hours of community service, attending classes concerning the dangers of prostitution, and paying a $5,000 fine for each charge count. While accepting the plea deal would lead to cases being expunged, it would require defendants to admit \\"that they would have been found guilty had the case gone to trial.\\" In a statement released on March 22, Kraft stated, \\"I am truly sorry.\\" His attorney William Burck has stated, \\"There was no human trafficking and law enforcement knows it,\\" while also asserting evidence in the case, from hidden cameras inside the spa and traffic stops, was obtained illegally. On March 26, Kraft's lawyers submitted a court filing, in which Kraft \\"waives arraignment, pleads not guilty to all charges and requests a jury trial.\\" On April 2, papers filed by Kraft's attorneys revealed that the hidden video cameras at the day spa had been installed when investigators entered the facility under the guise of a bomb threat in January. Kraft's legal team seeks to have the video recordings suppressed as evidence. His lawyers also sought to bar the videos from being released to the public; although on April 17, Florida prosecutors said they \\"cannot delay the release of records\\" and that they intended to release pixelated videos. Later that day, Florida Circuit Court Judge Joseph Marx ordered that the videos not be released prior to a hearing, and on April 23, Judge Leonard Hanser temporarily sealed the videos until a jury is selected or the case against Kraft is otherwise resolved. On May 13, Judge Hanser further ruled that prosecutors cannot use the videos in their case against Kraft, as detectives \\"did not do enough to minimize the invasion of privacy of other customers.\\" On October 1, prosecutors submitted a formal appeal of that ruling to suppress video evidence. On August 19, 2020, a Florida appeals court ruled that law enforcement violated Kraft's constitutional rights when obtaining certain video evidence, and they ruled that the video is not admissible in court. The following month, Florida prosecutors said they wouldn't appeal a court's decision blocking the video, making it likely that the charges against him would be dropped. On September 24, 2020, it was announced that the charges against Kraft had been dropped due to lack of sufficient evidence. ==Awards and honors== Kraft has received numerous honorary degrees from several colleges and universities and was awarded the NCAA's highest honor when he received the Theodore Roosevelt Award, \\"presented annually to a distinguished citizen of national reputation and outstanding accomplishments.\\" * In 2011, Kraft was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. * In 2012, he became the first NFL owner in the 43-year history of the honor to be selected for the George Halas Award by the Pro Football Writers of America.

However, the term is used by some authors to refer to a broader category that includes other patterns of religious practice. Most notably, Christian scholar D. G. Hart uses this term to compare and contrast the practices of evangelical Protestants and what he calls \\"confessional Protestants\\" (for example Anglicans and most Lutherans). He argues that the confessionals follow forms that are dictated by church authority or tradition, and calls these forms churchly forms. On the other hand, noting the resistance to such central authority and tradition among evangelicals, he labels the forms of these denominations parachurchly forms, as they are often dictated by parachurch organizations and other influences beyond the direct control of any particular church. There is little debate over whether confessional Protestants use forms. However, whether similar devices are used by evangelicals is hotly contested. Much of the opposition comes from within evangelicalism itself, due to the antiritualistic tendencies of many denominations. Other scholars of religion have however noted the tendency toward certain accepted patterns in religious practice. Robert Oden notes that this is true of nearly all religions, not just Christianity, and that it is true even of those movements that claim to be antiritualistic. If then we accept the broader usage of the word \\"form\\", there are a number of other forms besides the ones noted above. These include the products of what has, perhaps cynically, been called \\"Christian entrepreneurship\\", such as contemporary Christian music (and non- denominational praise songs), Christian T-shirts, and non-denominational book and video resources. ==References== * Hart, D.

(1956), Theory and practice of tympanoplasty. The Laryngoscope, 66: 1076‚Äì1093. # Type 1 involves repair of the tympanic membrane alone, when the middle ear is normal. A type 1 tympanoplasty is synonymous to myringoplasty. # Type 2 involves repair of the tympanic membrane and middle ear in spite of slight defects in the middle ear ossicles. # Type 3 involves removal of ossicles and epitympanum when there are large defects of the malleus and incus. The tympanic membrane is repaired and directly connected to the head of the stapes. # Type 4 describes a repair when the stapes foot plate is movable, but the crura are missing. The resulting middle ear will only consist of the Eustachian tube and hypotympanum. # Type 5 is a repair involving a fixed stapes footplate. ==Myringoplasty== The term 'myringoplasty' refers to repair of the tympanic membrane alone.Browning GG, Merchant SN, Kelly G et al. Chronic otitis media. In: Gleeson M, ed. Scott- Brown's Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery. London: Hodder Arnold, 2008:3395-445 There are several options for treating a perforated eardrum. If the perforation is from recent trauma, many ear, nose and throat specialists will elect to watch and see if it heals on its own. After that, surgery may be considered. ==Ossicular reconstruction== This procedure is required if there is a damage to the bone chain of the middle ear. Commonly affected bone is the long process of incus, where it gets necrosed. The bone chain can be repaired using autograft of incus or cartilage. Prosthetic implants made of titanium, hydroxyapatite or teflon are also used. ==Surgical Approach== Tympanoplasty can be performed through the ear canal (transcanal approach), through an incision in the ear (endaural approach) or through an incision behind the ear (postauricular approach). A graft may be taken to reconstruct the tympanic membrane. Common graft sites include the temporalis fascia and the tragus. The surgery takes ¬Ω to 1 hour if done through the ear canal and 1 and a half to two hours if an incision is needed. It is done under local or general anesthesia. It is done on an inpatient or day case basis and is successful 85-90% of the time . ==History== The first recorded attempt at repairing the tympanic membrane was made by Marcus BanzerBanzer, M. (1640) Disputatio de auditione laesa (Dissertation on deafness) in 1640 using an ivory tube covered by pig's bladder. ===Artificial tympanic membranes=== In the middle of the nineteenth century the British otologists James Yearsley and Joseph Toynbee each developed their own form of artificial eardrum. Despite initial enthusiasm for these devices, experience amongst the medical profession over the following half century demonstrated their minimal value in the treatment of a perforated eardrum, which generally heals naturally.Chu, EA and Jackler, RK (2003) The Artificial Tympanic Membrane (1840-1910): From Brilliant Innovation to Quack Device.

The OVA follows Kouji Kabuto, Tetsuya Tsurugi and the rest of the \\"Mazinger Team\\" as they fight against Dr. Hell's Mechanical Beasts while Kouji stumbles upon a forgotten laboratory where he finds Mazinkaiser, the most powerful robot ever built. The series chronicles Kouji's experience with the machine as he copes with Kaiser's power while defeating Dr. Hell's forces. The OVA series was directed by Masahiko Murata (Jinki:Extend, Corpse Princess) and written by Satoru Nishizono and Shinzo Fujita. It was first released on Japan through Home Video from September 25, 2001 to September 25, 2002 with a total of 7 episodes. An epilogue movie titled \\"Mazinkaiser vs. The Great General of Darkness\\" was released on theaters on July 25, 2003. Mazinkaiser emulates Go Nagai's character designs, and its operatic plot is supported by a \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" cynicism in regard to the gratuitous sex and violence. Some of the Episodes draw their plot elements from the manga itself rather than the TV series. ADV Films once licensed the series in English territories until the company's closure in 2009. ==Plot== In the 2002 OVA Mazinkaiser, Tetsuya fights alongside Kouji against Doctor Hell's forces. The OVA version of Great Mazinger is physically identical to the original, but with black coloring on the arms and legs instead of blue. Great is seriously damaged during the initial battle in the series. It became worse when the captured Mazinger Z attacks the Photon Power Labs even though Tetsuya does his best to defend the lab against Mazinger Z. Lastly, the rampaging Mazinkaiser leaves him badly injured while Great Mazinger is a complete wreck. Consequently, he leaves together with Jun to treat for his injuries. Near the end of the OVA, Tetsuya returns with a new and much more powerful Great, which is discovered in Doctor Juzo Kabuto's laboratory. This is said to be the real Great Mazinger (or \\"Shin Great Mazinger\\"). The \\"true\\" Great is structurally the same as the earlier version, but the color scheme for the forearms and legs is blue, as in the original 70's version. It is explained that the Great Mazinger made by Doctor Kenzo Kabuto (Kouji's father) is the prototype version seen in the early episodes, whereas Doctor Juzo Kabuto (Kouji's grandfather), who secretly works in an underground laboratory, managed to finish the final version of Great Mazinger. With a tremendous power compared to the prototype version, Tetsuya asked Kouji to confront Dr. Hell in Bardos Island. Kouji, without knowing the true Shin Great Mazinger, was worried and asked Tetsuya if he can handle an entire army of super robots. However, having the confidence with Shin Great Mazinger, Tetusya scolds Kouji of his cockiness. Therefore, Kouji flies off to fight Dr. Hell leaving Tetsuya against an entire army of mechanical beasts. Consequently, Shin Great Mazinger defeated the entire army of Doctor Hell including the possessed Venus Ace (although most of the battle was not shown). After the battle without damage, Great Mazinger decided to find and help Kouji in the Floating Fortress of Dr. Hell. The concept of Shin Great Mazinger is to bring Great Mazinger to the ranks of modern and more powerful robots such as Mazinkaiser and Shin Getter Robo. ==List of episodes== Episode 1: A Fierce Fight! Double Mazingers: Baron Ashura attacks Japan with an army of Mechanical Beasts, but is met head on by Kouji Kabuto and Mazinger Z. Ashura's forces manage to get the upper hand, and despite the arrival of Great Mazinger, Boss Borot and Aphrodite A, Mazinger Z is disabled and Kouji hurled to parts unknown. Dr. Hell quickly modifies Mazinger Z into the Ashura Mazinger and launches an attack on the Photon Power Lab. Despite Great being damaged, Tetsuya Tsurugi attempts a valiant defense but is overwhelmed. Before he can be killed by a gloating Ashura, a mystery robot wipes out the entire attacking Mechanical Beast army with one shot. Overpowering Ashura Mazinger easily, the mystery robot begins attacking the Lab and Great! Episode 2: A Descending, Malevolent Deity: Great Mazinger attempts to battle the mystery robot, but is easily swept aside. Just as the machine begins to power up its heat sinks, Sayaka arrives and begs the pilot to stop. Kouji later awakens in bed, having little recollection of piloting Mazinkaiser to the rescue and attacking the lab himself. He describes how he was brought to a cave he found Mazinkaiser, the final creation of his grandfather. Unfortunately, Mazinkaiser taps into the pilot's mind and is so powerful Kouji is overwhelmed and unable to use its power effectively, or even safely. Because of this, when Ashura uses the aerial fortress Gool and to attack a nearby city Great Mazinger, Aphrodite A and Boss Borot are dispatched while Kouji helplessly fumes back in the lab. Predictably, the three heroes are no match for the Mechanical Beast onslaught. When Kouji arrives, Ashura captures Sayaka and threatens to kill her if he does not surrender Mazinkaiser. Kouji separates the Kaiser Pilder from Kaiser itself, but as it is being loaded onto the ship the Great Booster arrives and cuts the chains, sending Ashura's forces into disarray as it barrels through them. Taking advantage, Kouji quickly yells \\"Pilder ON!\\" and brings Mazinkaiser to life. After a short but sharp battle, Ashura is sent packing. Tetsuya decides to leave with Jun to give his wounds time to heal and entrust the safety of Japan to Kouji. Episode 3: Kouji Assassination Order!: Enraged with the appearance of Mazinkaiser, Dr. Hell is furious with Baron Ashura. However, the wily henchman informs his master that he has already dispatched his three cute daughters to deal with Kouji, since without Kouji to pilot it Mazinkaiser is useless. Ashura's daughters attack Boss by mistake, prompting Dr. Yumi and Sayaka to forbid Kouji from leaving the Lab until the situation changes. Hot-headed as ever, Kouji sneaks out anyway and battles the three daughters of Ashura, who turn out to be killer androids. He defeats them just in time to rescue Sayaka and Boss from a Mechanical Beast. The episode finishes with the introduction of Lori and Loru, two busty American sisters who are Dr. Yumi's assistants. This episode introduces the Mazinkaiser version of Venus A, piloted by Sayaka instead of Jun. Episode 4: Sayaka Rescue Operation: On a day at the beach, Ashura kidnaps Sayaka and threatens to publicly humiliate her by cutting off her swimsuit if Kouji and Mazinkaiser do not surrender. Kouji is brought aboard the submarine Salude, but manages to escape and rescue Sayaka with Boss' help. Venus and Mazinkaiser make short work of the submarine. This episode is somewhat infamous for its crude sexual humour and fan service nudity. Episode 5: A Narrow Escape! The Photon Power Lab: Dr. Hell is fast losing patience with Ashura's failures, prompting the half-male, half-female villain to carry out a desperate plot. He attacks Dr. Yumi as he and Lori are travelling back to the Photon Power Lab and then disguises himself as the doctor. Unfortunately, he had no way of knowing it was the doctor's birthday and so was caught off-guard. Eventually losing patience, he attacks the Lab and is repelled. Dr. Hell angrily has him imprisoned and resolves to deal with Mazinkaiser himself. In the course of the episode Dr. Hell chances upon a group of more powerful, partly organic giants (Mykene Warrior Beasts) which he utilizes in place of the previous mechanical monsters. This episode is notable for having a disturbing shower scene with Ashura. Episode 6: Kouji Kabuto Dies in Magma!: Dr. Hell launches a full-scale assault on the Photon Power Lab, using the Ghost Mechanical Beast Drago Omega 1 to infect Venus A and turn it against them. His attack is followed up by a ground assault that successfully captures Kouji and the others. Boss and Boss Borot distract the enemy long enough for Kouji to reach and activate Mazinkaiser, but shortly thereafter Kouji is taken by surprise by the Combined Mechanical Beast (Gattai Kikaijuu), Garadabura MK01. Unable to effectively combat the flight-capable Mechanical Beast, Kouji and Mazinkaiser are dumped into an active Mount Fuji. Episode 7: A Decisive Battle!! Flaming Hell Castle!: After Mazinkaiser is dumped into Mount Fuji by the Combined Mechanical Beast, it pursues Boss, Sayaka and the other members of the Photon Power Lab. Before it can kill them it is struck by a massive lightning: the Great Hero, Great Mazinger has returned! While Great battles the Mechanical Beasts, Jun arrives and takes the group to the hidden fortress where Kouji discovered Mazinkaiser. She explains that she and Tetsuya discovered and explored the base, uncovering another Great Mazinger. This Great is far more powerful than the one Tetsuya piloted in the previous episodes and is described as Shin Great Mazinger (New Great Mazinger). The original Great Mazinger was the prototype version made by Dr. Kenzo Kabuto. At that time, Dr. Juzo Kabuto, thought to be dead, was secretly making the final version of Great Mazinger in his underground laboratory. He was also able to finish Mazinkaiser as his ultimate masterpiece. They also uncovered Kaiser Scrander, the wings of Mazinkaiser. Unknown to the unconscious Koji at Mt. Fuji, his Pilder has activated an automatic homing signal, which will activate the Kaiser Scrander. Diving into Mount Fuji, the Scrander docks with Mazinkaiser and the now complete Mazinkaiser emerges from the volcano. After briefly assisting Great, Kouji decides to attack Dr. Hell's base, which was uncovered when he launched his entire Mechanical Beast army. Great Mazinger faces the Mechanical Beast horde as Kouji arrives on Dr. Hell's island and is confronted by Baron Ashura, now rebuilt into a Mechanical Beast. After a long and difficult battle, Kouji emerges triumphant thanks to Mazinkaiser's Final Blade and thoughts of his friends and family. Dr. Hell attempts to win Kouji over to his side and when the hero refuses activates the island's self-destruct sequence. Unluckily for the villain, his escape craft is caught in the explosions as well, while Mazinkaiser emerges unharmed from the inferno. == Mazinkaiser vs. the Great General of Darkness == The OVA's success prompted the studio to release in 2003 Mazinkaiser vs. the Great General of Darkness (Mazinkaiser: Death! Ankoku Daishogun), a remake of 1974's Mazinger Z vs. The Great General of Darkness. The new Mazinger Team is overwhelmed by the surprise assault of the subterranean Mykene empire resulting in many casualties, but Mazinkaiser ultimately defeats the forces of evil, ending with a bitter duel against the leader of Mykene, the Great General of Darkness. This does not share continuity with the Mazinkaiser OVA's, nor does it feature the same version of Mazinkaiser. ==References== ==External links== *The official website of Mazinkaizer (in Japanese) * * ==See also== Mazinkaizer SKL Category:2001 anime OVAs Category:2003 anime OVAs Category:ADV Films Category:Japanese films Category:Mazinger Category:Super robot anime and manga ","title":"Mazinkaiser"},{"id":"1426008","text":"Ray Huang (; 25 June 19188 January 2000) was a Chinese-American historian and philosopher. He was an officer in the Nationalist army and fought in the Burma campaigns. He earned a Ph.D in history from the University of Michigan, worked with Joseph Needham and is a contributor of Needham's Science and Civilisation in China. Huang taught in the U.S., and is best known in his later years for the idea of macro-history. ==Early life== Ray Huang was born in Ningxiang, Hunan Province, in 1918. He was the oldest of three children. His father, Huang Zhenbai (), was an early member of the revolutionary group, Tongmenghui, who became less active in the group over the years. Ray Huang grew up in Hunan and went to study electrical engineering at Nankai University, Tianjin in 1936. At the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1938, he returned to Changsha and wrote for the Anti-Japanese War Report (). Afterwards, he entered the Republic of China Military Academy () at Chengdu, Sichuan, graduating in 1940. He was appointed Second Lieutenant Platoon Leader in 1941; he was a staff First Lieutenant stationed in India in 1942, and a Staff Major in the New First Army in the Burma theater from 1943‚Äì1945. While in Burma, he was shot through the thigh, but he made a complete recovery. After the war he attended the American Army Staff College (graduating in 1947), and was aide- de-camp to the head of the Chinese military delegation participating in the Allied occupation of Japan from 1949‚Äì1950. However, with the loss of mainland China in 1949, the Nationalist army in Taiwan was purged of political opponents in 1950. Huang's superior in Japan was accused of Communist links and as a result, Huang was discharged from the Nationalist Army in 1950. His military career was over. ==Academic career== Huang went to the United States to study Chinese History. At the University of Michigan, he received his Bachelor's degree in 1954, his Masters Degree in 1957 and his Doctorate in 1964. He was appointed Visiting Associate Professor at Columbia University in 1967, and a Professor at the State University of New York, New Paltz Branch in 1968‚Äì1980. He was a research fellow at the Fairbank Center for East Asian Research at Harvard in 1970. He worked with the leading American Sinologist John K. Fairbank. Nevertheless, Huang and Fairbank disagreed in research methodology. Fairbank liked concentrated analysis in short time frames and limited areas, while Huang liked synthesis covering broad time periods (though Huang's classic work 1587, a Year of No Significance had a very tight focus). In 1972, Huang went to Cambridge University and assisted Joseph Needham, who was more sympathetic to Huang's research approach, in Needham's monumental work on the history of Chinese science and technology. Huang's chosen field of study became financial administration in Ming China, and he published one of his major works, Taxation and Finance in Sixteenth Century Ming China, in 1974 (translated into Chinese only in 2001). He returned to Cambridge in the mid 1970s, and contributed two chapters to the Ming Dynasty Volumes of The Cambridge History of China. Around the late 1970s, he retired from teaching and focused on writing instead, even occasionally contributing to a column in Yazhou Zhoukan. Nonetheless, he often travelled to Taiwan even after retirement to give lectures and participate in various academic exchanges. His other works include The War in Northern Burma (1946), 1587, a Year of No Significance (1981) (also published in Chinese as The Fifteenth Year of Wan Li/„ÄäËê¨ÊõÜÂçÅ‰∫îÂπ¥„Äã, 1985), Broadening the Chinese Field of Vision (in Chinese, 1988), Chinese Macrohistory (1988) (in Chinese 1993), Conversations about Chinese History on the Banks of the Hudson River (in Chinese 1989), Discussions of Here and There and Old and New (in Chinese 1991), Capitalism and the Twenty First Century (in Chinese 1991), From a Macrohistory Perspective in Reading Jiang Jieshi's Diary (in Chinese 1993), Contemporary Chinese Outlets (in Chinese 1994), The Affair of Wan Chong (in Chinese 1998), Yellow River Blue Mountain: Record of Huang Renzi's Recollections (in Chinese 2001), and Bianjing Unfinished Dreams. ==Personal life== He married Gayle Bates (1937‚Äì2000) in 1966 and the two had a son, Jefferson, a longtime administrator at Claremont McKenna College,https://www.cmc.edu/admission/admission-and- financial-aid-staff as well as two other sons from his wife's previous marriage.https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/jacksonsun/obituary.aspx?n=gayle- huang&pid;=144661905 He died of a heart attack in 2000. ==Books== *1587, a Year of No Significance.

He is a double cousin of Lancelot and cousin of Lancelot's younger half-brother Ector de Maris (not to be confused with the older Sir Ector, who was King Arthur's foster-father). ==Arthurian legend== Lionel's attributed arms When their father dies in battle against King Claudas, Lionel and Bors are rescued by the Lady of the Lake and raised in her underwater kingdom alongside her foster-son Lancelot. Like all his family, Lionel becomes a Knight of the Round Table. Bors chooses to save a maiden rather than his brother Lionel While travelling with Lancelot as a young man, Lionel is captured by the rogue knight Turquine, who whips him with briars and throws him in the dungeon. The scenario repeats itself later while he is on the Quest for the Holy Grail, where he proves very unworthy of the blessed object by trying to kill his brother for not rescuing him. Bors had seen Lionel getting beaten and led away, but had to make a decision to save either him or a young girl being dragged in the opposite direction. He saves the girl, and fears Lionel dead. But Lionel escapes, and attacks Bors the next time they meet. Bors proves himself worthy of the Grail when he refuses to fight back, and Lionel kills a religious hermit and Sir Calogrenant, a fellow Knight of the Round Table, when they try to protect Bors from his wrath. Before Lionel can strike his brother, however, God intervenes and immobilises him. Lionel and the rest of his family follow Lancelot into exile when the affair with Queen Guinevere is exposed. Lionel participates in the battles against King Arthur and becomes King of Gaunnes. After the Battle of Camlann, Lancelot's family returns to Britain to defeat the remainder of Mordred's forces.

The Spanish word naipes is loaned from nƒÅ'ib, ranks of face cards found in the Mamluk deck. The earliest record of naip comes from a Catalan rhyming dictionary by Jaume March II in 1371, but without any context or definition. By 1380, naipero (card-maker) was a recognized profession. In December 1382, card games were banned from being played in Barcelona's corn exchange.

The removal of one rank shortened the deck to 48 which made card production simpler: a whole deck could be made with just two uncut sheets. 48-card decks have nine ranks of pip cards (1-9) and three ranks of face cards (10-12). Since the mid-20th century, they have usually been sold with two jokers, for a total of 50 cards. Stripped decks have 40 cards, lacking ranks 8 and 9 and jokers. The popularity of the stripped deck is due to game of Ombre, which became a craze throughout Europe during the 17th century. Valencia pattern cards from 1778. They are closely related to the Old Catalan pattern. The Spanish suits closely resemble Italian-suited cards as both were derived from the Arab cards. The four suits are bastos (clubs), oros (literally \\"golds\\", that is, golden coins), copas (cups) and espadas (swords). Unlike the suits found in northern Italy, Spanish swords are straight and the clubs resemble knobbly cudgels instead of ceremonial batons. Swords and clubs also do not intersect (except in the 3 of clubs card). Two surviving early decks did have intersecting clubs and swords like in Italian or Arab cards. The Spanish may have separated the pips in the 15th century to make them more easily distinguishable (some export cards kept the intersecting pips, see \\"Extinct Portuguese pattern\\" below). Each card has an outline frame to distinguish the suit without showing all of your cards: The cups have one interruption, the swords two, the clubs three, and the gold none. This mark is called \\"la pinta\\" and gave rise to the expression: le conoc√≠ por la pinta (\\"I knew him by his markings\\"). La pinta first appeared around the mid-17th century. Like the Italian-suited tarot, the deck is used for both game playing and cartomancy. The Spanish deck has been widely considered to be part of the occult in many Latin American countries, yet they continue to be used widely for card games and gambling, especially in Spain. The three face cards of each suit have pictures similar to the jack, queen, and king in the French deck, and rank identically. They are the sota, which is similar to the jack/knave and generally depicts a page or squire, the caballo (knight, literally \\"horse\\"), and the rey (king) respectively. There are instances of historical decks having both caballo and reina (queen), the caballo being of lower value than queen. These decks have no numbers in the figure values, not even letters as in the French deck. Reversible face cards exist but are not popular. It is also possible to find 52-card French decks with Spanish pictures. These have English corner indices which means the Knight will have the Queen's \\"Q\\" index. Historically, Spain was split into several independent states. Even after these states began sharing the same monarchy, they maintained their own separate parliaments, laws, and taxes for several centuries. In the 16th century, Spain became the first country to tax playing cards. The various regions and states kept track of the taxes they were owed by requiring producers, who were often monopolies (estanco), to conform to a regional pattern for cards sold locally. Known regional patterns include the Seville, Madrid, Toledo, Navarre, Valencia, and Catalonia patterns. There were also export patterns, possibly including the little known Toulouse/Girona patternS-2 at the International Playing-Card Society. Retrieved 11 October 2016. or the \\"Dragon cards\\" (see below). Spain and France exported cards to each other, which explains why the kings and jacks in French-suited face cards resemble their Spanish counterparts, notably the standing kings. There was some deliberate copying; the king of coins from the Seville and Franco-Spanish patterns is near identical to the king of hearts in the French-suited Rouen pattern, which was exported to England and through centuries of bad reproduction became known as the \\"suicide king\\".Wintle, Simon.

Popular games like Arrenegada (Portuguese name for Ombre), Bisca (Portuguese name for briscola) and Sueca, which were played with Latin-suited cards, had to be adapted to the new French-suited cards.McLeod, John. Card games in Portugal at pagat.com. Retrieved 13 November 2016. Thus: * the old suit names were attributed to the new suits - this is the reason why Portuguese names for suits do not match the suit drawings. In Portuguese, the Hearts suit is called Copas (\\"cups\\"), the Spades suit is called Espadas (\\"swords\\"), the Diamonds suit is called Ouros (\\"gold coins\\"), and the Clubs suit is called Paus (\\"clubs\\" or \\"sticks\\"). * the new face cards (King, Queen, Jack) had also to match the old ones (King, Knight, Knave). The King match was an obvious one, but the Queen was held for the lower court card because the old Portuguese sotas were female, and so it was matched with the Knave. The Jack was thought to be the Knight (Cavalier). Thus, in traditional Portuguese games, the cards usually rank King-Jack-Queen. Both conventions mentioned above are also practiced in Malta which once used Portuguese-suited decks.McLeod, John. Card games in Malta at pagat.com. Retrieved 13 November 2016. The extinct Portuguese deck featured straight swords and knobbly clubs like the Spanish suits but intersected them like the northern Italian suits. The Aces featured dragons, the kings were seated, and the knaves were all distinctly female.

It does so by the covalent modification of histidine (most strongly), lysine, cysteine, and tyrosine residues. DEPC-treated (and therefore RNase-free) water is used in handling of RNA in the laboratory to reduce the risk of RNA being degraded by RNases. Water is usually treated with 0.1% v/v DEPC for at least 2 hours at 37 ¬∞C and then autoclaved (at least 15 min) to inactivate traces of DEPC. Inactivation of DEPC in this manner yields CO2 and ethanol. Higher concentrations of DEPC are capable of deactivating larger amounts of RNase, but remaining traces or byproducts may inhibit further biochemical reactions such as in vitro transcription. Furthermore, chemical modification of RNA such as carboxymethylation is possible when traces of DEPC or its byproducts are present, resulting in impaired recovery of intact RNA even after buffer exchange (after precipitation). DEPC treated water for use in a laboratory DEPC is unstable in water and susceptible to hydrolysis to carbon dioxide and ethanol, especially in the presence of a nucleophile. For this reason, DEPC cannot be used with Tris or HEPES buffers. In contrast, it can be used with phosphate-buffered saline or MOPS. A handy rule is that enzymes or chemicals which have active -O:, -N: or -S: cannot be treated with DEPC to become RNase-free, as DEPC reacts with these species. Furthermore, DEPC degradation products can inhibit in vitro transcription. DEPC derivatization of histidines is also used to study the importance of histidyl residues in enzymes. Modification of histidine by DEPC results in carbethoxylated derivates at the N-omega-2 nitrogen of the imidazole ring. DEPC modification of histidines can be reversed by treatment with 0.5 M hydroxylamine at neutral pH.

A left wingback, Luxemburgo represented Flamengo, Internacional and Botafogo before retiring in 1980. He subsequently became a manager, and led Palmeiras, Corinthians, Cruzeiro and Santos to S√©rie A titles, winning the tournament five times, a record total. In 2005 he worked at Real Madrid, but was dismissed in December of that year. His surname is after revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg. ==Playing career== Born in Nova Igua√ßu, Rio de Janeiro, Luxemburgo played the most of his youth football for Botafogo, but made his senior debut with Flamengo in 1972; at the club, he was mainly a backup to J√∫nior. He left Fla in 1978 to Internacional, but remained at the club for just one year before returning to his first team Botafogo. He retired in 1980, aged 28, due to a knee injury. ==Coaching career== ===Early career=== Before being a first team manager, Luxemburgo spent the rest of the 1980 campaign with Ant√¥nio Lopes' Olaria, but not being officially under contract with the club. He was also Lopes' assistant at America-RJ (1981) and Vasco da Gama (1981‚Äì82). Luxemburgo's first managerial experience occurred in 1983, with Campo Grande; he only lasted eight matches at the club, being sacked after altercations with the board. In the same year, he also managed Rio Branco-ES, winning the Campeonato Capixaba with the side. In 1984, after managing Friburguense, Luxemburgo then moved abroad to Saudi Arabia's Al-Ittihad; initially Joubert's assistant, he was in subsequently charge of the club. He was at the helm of Democrata-GV in the following year, but only lasted three months. Luxemburgo subsequently rejoined Lopes' staff at Fluminense in 1986, where he acted as manager of the under-20 squad. In the following year, he replaced Pinheiro in charge of America-RJ. Another stint in the Middle East following, being again assistant of Joubert at Al-Shabab. Luxemburgo returned to Brazil in October 1988, after being invited to manage Bragantino. At the club, he gained notoriety after winning the 1990 Campeonato Paulista. He subsequently worked at Flamengo, Guarani and Ponte Preta before being hired by Palmeiras in 1993; he led the latter club to both the state and league championships in 1993 and 1994. When Luxemburgo left in 1995 for Flamengo, Palmeiras' performance was visibly affected, and when he came back in 1996 (after a short period at Paran√°), the team won the S√£o Paulo State championship again. After a brief stint at Santos, in 1998 he went to Corinthians and won the league that year. He left the club in the following year, to join the Brazilian national team. Luxemburgo coached Brazil after the 1998 FIFA World Cup until the end of 2000 Olympics. Most notably, he is known for centering his play around Rivaldo. In 1999 the Sele√ß√£o won the Copa Am√©rica undefeated. However, he is also remembered for the disastrous performance at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, where Brazil lost 1‚Äì2 in overtime to gold medal winners Cameroon despite having a two men advantage in that game. He was often blamed at this tournament for leaving out Rom√°rio, who had gone on national television, pleading his case to play in the tournament. In 2001, he went back to Corinthians and won yet another State Championship. In 2003, he led Cruzeiro Esporte Clube to win the Brazilian National League. Even more impressively, the club won two of the three competitions (the Campeonato Mineiro and the Copa do Brasil) without losing a single match. The following year he led Santos to win the Brazilian Championship. Luxemburgo also stirred up controversy by having a one-way transmission device on a forward of his club team during a match. He claimed that the Cameroon match inspired him to create a device in order to tell his players where and when to attack. The CBF ruled days later that such electronic devices were illegal, but did not penalize him for using it in that match. ===Real Madrid=== Luxemburgo was hired as Real Madrid's coach from Santos in the second half of the 2004/2005 season when Mariano Garc√≠a Rem√≥n was dismissed from the job. He led Real Madrid to seven consecutive league wins, putting them back in the title race but ended up losing it four points behind FC Barcelona. In the following season, Real Madrid started brightly. However, the introduction of a new formation (the Magic Rectangle, a 4‚Äì2‚Äì2‚Äì2 formation), combined with multiple injury issues and poor performances began Luxemburgo's downfall. Calls for him to resign were intensified after a humiliating 0‚Äì3 home defeat to long-time rivals, Barcelona. He was sacked on 5 December 2005, Real Madrid announced Juan Ram√≥n L√≥pez Caro would be his successor. ===Santos=== Luxemburgo signed, for the third time, a contract with Santos, leading the club to the 2006 S√£o Paulo State Championship and in fourth place of the S√©rie A. He continued with Santos in 2007 and won the S√£o Paulo State Championship again. He also saw Santos through the semi-finals of the 2007 Copa Libertadores, winning all the matches in the group stage and eliminating strong teams, such as Caracas in the round of 16 and Am√©rica in the quarter-finals, before losing to Gr√™mio in the semis. Later Luxemburgo finished second in the S√©rie A. In both years, 2006 and 2007, he led Santos to a Copa Libertadores berth. ===Palmeiras return=== At the end of 2007, Luxemburgo left Santos. He signed with Palmeiras in 2008, and won the S√£o Paulo State Championship for the third consecutive time. With Palmeiras he was eliminated from the Sudamericana by Argentinos Juniors and from the Brazilian Cup by Sport Recife the eventual champions. In the 2008 S√©rie A he reached fourth place with Palmeiras in a very competitive season, earning the club a spot in the Libertadores. Luxemburgo remained with Palmeiras in 2009. He managed the team to a successful campaign in the S√£o Paulo State Championship but lost to Santos in the semi-finals. In the Copa Libertadores he conquered a place in the Round of 16 by defeating Colo-Colo 1‚Äì0 in Santiago, with Cleiton Xavier scoring a last minute long-range goal in the angle of Colo-Colo's goalkeeper. Palmeiras defeated Sport Recife on penalties in the Round of 16, but were eliminated by an away goal from Nacional from Uruguay drawing both matches, by 1‚Äì1 at home and 0‚Äì0 away. In the 2009 S√©rie A Luxemburgo started well in the competition, but after an incident involving young striker Keirrison, Luxemburgo was dismissed from Palmeiras in the seventh round of the competition. ===Santos return=== Luxemburgo in 2010 He was re-signed as Head Coach of Santos after a one and a half-year absence on 17 July 2009 and on 7 December 2009 the coach quit Santos, finishing 12th in the league, to sign with Atl√©tico Mineiro. === Return of Flamengo / Gr√™mio === On 5 October 2010, Vanderlei Luxemburgo was named as a new head coach of Flamengo, and managed the club until February 2012. On 21 February 2012, it was announced that Luxemburgo was taking charge of Gr√™mio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense until 31 December 2012. On 29 April 2013, after getting involved in a fight in the game between Gr√™mio and Huachipato for the Libertadores Cup, Luxemburgo was suspended for six games in this competition.Conmebol divulga puni√ß√µes e tira Luxa do Gr√™mio por seis jogos On 29 June 2013, Luxemburgo was dismissed by directors of Gr√™mio. ===Fluminense=== Luxemburgo in 2013 On 30 July 2013, Luxemburgo signed with carioca side Fluminense FC, that dismissed, one day earlier, Abel Braga. Luxemburgo defended his predecessor, calling him \\"winner\\", and lamented his resignation, a \\"culture of brazilian football\\". The coach, to resume, wants his players \\"wrathful with losses\\". On 12 November Fluminense FC sacked Luxemburgo after a long winless streak. At the time Fluminense stood in 18th place in the Brazilian S√©rie A and was under relegation threat. ===Flamengo (4th spell)=== On 23 July 2014, Luxemburgo was named as a new head coach of Flamengo with the mission of taking lot of an unprecedented low points record at the start of the Brazilian national league (Brasileiro). Luxa was ultimately successful in leading the club's struggle against relegation, earning important points in the tournament and taking the team to the upper half of the table. === Cruzeiro === On 2 June 2015, Vanderlei Luxemburgo was named as a new head coach of Cruzeiro Esporte Clube, but was dismissed after poor results on 31 August. ===Tianjin Songjiang=== On 23 September 2015, Vanderlei Luxemburgo was named as a new head coach of Tianjin Songjiang, for the 2016 season. He was sacked the following 5 June, with the club only in the eighth position, and was subsequently replaced by Fabio Cannavaro. ===Sport Recife=== On 29 May 2017, Luxemburgo was named as the new head coach Sport Recife, and won the year's Campeonato Pernambucano with the club. On 26 October, after a poor run of form, he was relieved from his duties. ===Vasco da Gama=== On 8 May 2019, Luxemburgo was named manager of Vasco da Gama, agreeing to a contract until the end of the year. After helping the side avoid relegation, he departed the club on 13 December. ===Palmeiras (5th spell)=== On 15 December 2019, Luxemburgo signed a two-year contract with Palmeiras, returning to the club after 11 years. He won the 2020 Campeonato Paulista with the club, being this the fifth time winning the competition with the club and ninth overall, and surpassed Lula as the most successful manager of the tournament. On 14 October 2020, after a 1‚Äì3 home defeat against Coritiba, Luxemburgo was sacked. ==Honours== ===Player=== Flamengo *Campeonato Carioca: 1972, 1974, 1978 ===Manager=== ====Club==== Rio Branco-ES *Campeonato Capixaba: 1983 Bragantino *Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie B: 1989 *Campeonato Paulista: 1990 Palmeiras *Campeonato Paulista: 1993, 1994, 1996, 2008, 2020 *Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A: 1993, 1994 *Torneio Rio ‚Äì S√£o Paulo: 1993 Santos *Torneio Rio ‚Äì S√£o Paulo: 1997 *Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A: 2004 *Campeonato Paulista: 2006, 2007 Corinthians *Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A: 1998 *Campeonato Paulista: 2001 Cruzeiro *Campeonato Mineiro: 2003 *Copa do Brasil: 2003 *Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A: 2003 Atl√©tico Mineiro *Campeonato Mineiro: 2010 Flamengo *Campeonato Carioca: 2011 Sport *Campeonato Pernambucano: 2017 ====International==== Brazil *Copa Am√©rica: 1999 ==See also== List of Brazil national football team managers ==References== ==External links== * { class=\\"navbox collapsible collapsed\\" ! class=\\"navbox- title\\" style=\\"padding-left:4em;\\"  - style=\\"font-size:116%\\" } Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:People from Nova Igua√ßu Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A players Category:Brazilian football managers Category:Brazilian expatriate football managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Saudi Arabia Category:Expatriate football managers in Spain Category:Expatriate football managers in China Category:1999 Copa Am√©rica managers Category:1999 FIFA Confederations Cup managers Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A managers Category:La Liga managers Category:China League One managers Category:Clube de Regatas do Flamengo footballers Category:Sport Club Internacional players Category:Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas players Category:Campo Grande Atl√©tico Clube managers Category:Rio Branco Atl√©tico Clube managers Category:Friburguense Atl√©tico Clube managers Category:Ittihad FC managers Category:Esporte Clube Democrata managers Category:America Football Club (RJ) managers Category:Clube Atl√©tico Bragantino managers Category:Guarani FC managers Category:Clube de Regatas do Flamengo managers Category:Associa√ß√£o Atl√©tica Ponte Preta managers Category:Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras managers Category:Paran√° Clube managers Category:Santos FC managers Category:Sport Club Corinthians Paulista managers Category:Brazil national football team managers Category:Cruzeiro Esporte Clube managers Category:Real Madrid CF managers Category:Clube Atl√©tico Mineiro managers Category:Gr√™mio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense managers Category:Fluminense FC managers Category:Tianjin Tianhai F.C. managers Category:Sport Club do Recife managers Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Saudi Arabia Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in China Category:Association football defenders Category:CR Vasco da Gama managers ","title":"Vanderlei Luxemburgo"},{"id":"1426027","text":"Channel America (CA), officially Channel America Network, Inc., was the first United States terrestrial broadcast television network to be intentionally assembled out of LPTV, or low-power television licensees. The network was founded by David Post in 1987 and launched in 1988. It offered a 24-hour feed of mostly inexpensive programming, delivered to its affiliate stations, many owned and originally established by the network, via satellite. ==History== Channel America was founded in 1987 by David Post, who had hopes of creating a network with 1,000 low-power television stations. The network never reached its goal in terms of affiliates, but still launched in 1988.M. Bosko, On Ramp: Opportunities on Satellite, Videomaker, July 1995, accessed March 6, 2007 In 1990, Channel America moved to get more affiliated cable operators' local origination channel by rolling out a three-hour package of programming with interactive elements, Hometown USA, with American Television & Communications committing a best-of-local-origination series with the working title Off Broadway. In late 1995, the network peaked with a reach of 44,000,000 households through 100 affiliates. On September 18, 1995, EVRO Entertainment of Kissimmee, Florida acquired a 51% interest in the Channel America Network, with the option to buy the remaining 49%.Form 8-K, United States Securities and Exchange Commission, September 18, 1995, accessed March 6, 2007 On July 1, 1996, the channel announced that they would air a preview of My Pet Television Network, a joint venture of Nightwing Entertaintment Group, Inc. and The Humane Society of the United States, on September 9. The network went off the air in 1996. In March 1997, its parent company and LDE Media Techniqs, Morton Downey Jr.'s company, agreed to merge. Downey planned to launch a news magazine called Boyz Night Out on the revived network. ==Programs== In addition to its cable access programming mentioned above, among the other shows on Channel America was Hot Seat, a talk show hosted by Wally George which was produced by KDOC in Anaheim, California. (Ironically, KDOC never joined the Channel America network). The network also aired several classic shows from Columbia Pictures Television, including Hazel, Gidget, The Flying Nun, Family, Ghost Story, Bridget Loves Bernie, and The Fantastic Journey. ==Channel America Broadcasting== Channel America Broadcasting, Inc., formerly Moreno-Cripple Creek Corporation, Moreno Uranium Corporation, EnviroSearch Corp., to EVRO Financial Corp. and EVRO Corporation, was the owner of Channel America Network, Inc. and The Sports & Shopping Network Inc. ===History=== Moreno-Cripple Creek Corporation was organized February 5, 1946 and renamed Moreno Uranium Corporation on March 12, 1954 then to EnviroSearch Corp. on March 10, 1970. On May 24, 1974, 1 millions of the corporation's shares were sold to Cresson Consolidated, Inc. Cresson then liquidated itself passing the shares onto its stockholders with EnviroSearch becoming a full reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 16, 1974. On September 17, 1986, the corporation changed its name to EVRO Financial Corp. then to EVRO Corporation on March 1, 1994. From 1946 to 1987, the corporation was in the oil and gas industry holding various general and limited partnership and stock investments in other oil and gas companies while also investing in land for resale. In 1987, EVRO sold most of its oil and gas properties, partnerships and real estate. EVRO acquired on February 15, 1990 all the stock of Treasure Rockhound Ranches, Inc. Under a reorganization plan, ENRO acquired Lintronics Technologies, Inc. in all-stock deal that gave 94% of the outstanding shares to Lintronic shareholders. EVRO agreed to purchase 60% of the shares of The Good Health Channel, Inc. for stock on February 22, 1994. Also that year, EVRO formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Tres Rivers, Inc. to purchase the assets of Three Rios, Ltd., consisting of a 46-acre recreational vehicle campground agreed to on July 15, 1994. Technology Holdings, Inc. (THI) was formed on January 20, 1995 whereupon EVRO transferred all its assets and liabilities to THI: Lintronics, Treasure Rockhound, Tres Rivers and EVRO Trading Corporation, and its holdings in Good Health into THI in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding stock of THI. THI was created to make way for the purchase of The Sports & Shopping Network Inc. With the ending of the health related business segment in March 1995, THI, EVRO and the President of EVRO Trading triggered a dispute between them. To settle the dispute, EVRO Trading President was given 55% ownership of EVRO Trading, while EVRO would continue to own 45% with no other obligation and a THI note for the EVRO Trading President's amount due secured by the 45% remaining EVRO interest in EVRO Trading. THI defaulted on the note April 3, 1995, giving the remaining ownership of EVRO Trading to its president. EVRO and The Stellar Companies Inc. agreed in January 1995 for EVRO to acquire The Sports & Shopping Network Inc. (\\"TSSN\\") from Stellar with Stellar shareholders receiving a controlling share of EVRO stock. EVRO agreed in April 1995 to purchase with stock the America's Collectibles Network Inc. and merge the network with the TSSN. The deal to purchase ACN fell through due to SEC reporting concerns. On September 18, 1995, EVRO of Kissimmee, Florida acquired a 51% interest in the Channel America Network, with the option to buy the remaining 49%. In June 1996, EVRO indicated plans to move Channel America and its other television operations to Glendale Studios, Glendale. In October 1996, EVRO shareholders voted to changes its name to Channel America Broadcasting, Inc. and increase the number of common and preferred shares authorized. Following the shareholder's annual meeting, the Board of Directors voted to change CA to a home shopping format temporarily. The network went off the air in 1996 and the parent company was delisted from the NASDAQ later that year due to \\"insufficient capital and surplus,\\" with the share value dropping from a high of $2.50 to 7 cents. In March 1997, Channel America Broadcasting and LDE Media Techniqs, Morton Downey Jr.'s company, agreed to merge. Downey planned to launch a news magazine on the Channel called Boyz Night Out. ==References== ==See also== *America One *American Independent Network *Urban America Television *ION Television Category:Defunct television networks in the United States Category:Television channels and stations established in 1987 Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 1995 ","title":"Channel America"},{"id":"1426032","text":"Spaceship Earth is a geodesic sphere that serves as the symbolic structure of Epcot, a theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida. It is also the name of the dark ride attraction that is housed within the sphere that takes guests on a time machine-themed experience. The 15-minute dark ride demonstrates to guests how advancements in human communication have helped to create the future one step at a time. Passengers journey back in time to witness the origins of prehistoric man, then travel forward in time to witness important breakthroughs in communication throughout history‚Äîfrom the invention of the alphabet to the creation of the printing press to today's modern communication advancements, including telecommunication and mass communication. At the conclusion of the ride, passengers have the chance to design their own future using touch screens that are embedded into the ride cars. On February 25, 2020, the Disney Parks Blog announced that Spaceship Earth would be closing for refurbishment on May 26, 2020. However, its refurbishment was placed on indefinite hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Structure== Close-up of Spaceship Earth's Alucobond tiles The structure is similar in texture to the United States pavilion from Expo 67 in Montreal but, unlike that structure, Spaceship Earth is a complete sphere, supported by three pairs of legs. The architectural design was conceived by Wallace Floyd Design Group.The structural designs of both Expo 67 and Spaceship Earth were completed by Simpson Gumpertz & Heger Inc. of Boston, Massachusetts. Geometrically, Spaceship Earth is derived from the Class 2 geodesic polyhedron with frequency of division equal to 8. Each face of the polyhedron is divided into three isosceles triangles to form each point. In theory, there are 11,520 total isosceles triangles forming 3840 points. In reality, some of those triangles are partially or fully nonexistent due to supports and doors; there are actually only 11,324 silvered facets, with 954 partial or full flat triangular panels. The appearance of being a monolithic sphere is an architectural goal that was achieved through a structural trick. Spaceship Earth is in fact two structural domes. Six legs are supported on pile groups that are driven up to 160 feet into Central Florida's soft earth. Those legs support a steel box-shaped ring at the sphere's perimeter, at about 30 degrees south latitude in earth-terms. The upper structural dome sits on this ring. A grid of trusses inside the ring supports two helical structures of the ride and show system. Below the ring, a second dome is hung from the bottom, completing the spherical shape. The ring and trusses form a table-like structure which separates the upper dome from the lower. Supported by and about three feet off the structural domes is a cladding sphere to which the shiny Alucobond panels and drainage system are mounted. The cladding was designed so that when it rains, no water pours off the sides onto the ground. All water is collected through one-inch gaps in the facets into a gutter system, and the water is channeled into the World Showcase Lagoon. ==History== ===Design and construction=== The Alucobond construction, which took over two years to complete The structure was designed with the help of science fiction writer Ray Bradbury, who also helped write the original storyline for the attraction. The term \\"Spaceship Earth\\" was popularised by Buckminster Fuller, who also popularized the geodesic dome. Construction took 26 months. Extending upwards from the table are \\"quadropod\\" structures, which support smaller beams which form the shell of the steel skeleton. Pipes stand the aluminum skin panels away from the skeleton and provide space for utilities. A small service car is parked in the interstitial space between the structural and cladding surfaces, and it can carry a prone technician down the sides to access repair locations. The shop fabrication of the steel (done in nearby Tampa, Florida) was an early instance of computer-aided drafting and materials processing. Spaceship Earth was originally sponsored by the Bell System from 1982 until 1984, when it was broken into smaller companies and its parent company, AT&T;, became an independent company. AT&T; sponsored Spaceship Earth from 1984 until 2004. From 2005 until 2017, the German company Siemens was the sponsor of Spaceship Earth. As of 2019, the ride currently has no sponsor. The private sponsor lounge, located on the second floor above Project Tomorrow, is currently used for special events. ===Dedication=== During Epcot Center's opening ceremony William Ellinghaus, then president of AT&T; dedicated Spaceship Earth stated: \\"Now as you will soon see, Spaceship Earth‚Äôs theme is communications, civilization and communications from Stone Age to Information Age, and I therefore think it is very fitting that we dedicate Spaceship Earth to all of the people who have advanced communications, arts, and sciences, and in so doing have demonstrated that communications is truly the beginning of understanding.\\" ===Ride updates=== From October 1, 1982 to May 25, 1986, the attraction experience began with the ride vehicles moving up into the structure through a lighted tunnel, enhanced by a fog machine, and then ascending on a spiraling track up through dark spaces featuring a series of lighted historic vignettes. The attraction featured actor Vic Perrin as the narrator along with a very simple and quiet orchestral composition throughout. The theme of \\"communication through the ages\\" is presented in chronological order in settings peopled with Audio-Animatronics figures. Cavemen are seen telling stories using wall carvings; Egyptians work on hieroglyphics and papyrus as a pharaoh inspects the final result. A Greek theater presents actors declaiming Oedipus Rex. Charioteers carry messages from a Roman court, and Jewish and Islamic scholars discuss texts. With typical Disney whimsy, a monk is seen having fallen asleep on a manuscript he was inscribing. Michelangelo, overhead, paints the ceiling of the Sistine chapel, and Gutenberg mans his printing press. Suggesting the rush of 20th-century technology, subsequent scenes meld together as the circumference of the ride track narrows. A newsboy hawks papers, a movie marquee and film clips represent motion pictures, and radio and television are represented. On the right side of the track, the vehicles then pass a wall with angled windows looking out into the stars, a glass wall with a mainframe computer blinking behind it, and a woman observing technical readouts on various screens. On the left side of the track, a man and a woman are seen working at a network operations center with a data map of the United States. As the vehicles reach the large space at the apex of the ride system, guests see, on the planetarium ceiling of the sphere, a projection of \\"our spaceship earth\\", and then they pass under a large lighted space station with two astronauts working on satellites and a woman sitting in the station operating controls. The Omnimover vehicles then revolve 180 degrees and pass under the woman through the station's ‚Äúhangar‚Äù, so that the passengers lie backward facing the \\"sky\\" as they begin their descent on a relatively straight track passing various monitors showing various events and activities. The ride stops intermittently as wheelchairs are loaded or unloaded. Spaceship Earth at night From May 26 to 28, 1986, the attraction was given a slight remodel. This second version of the attraction started off with the lighted tunnel enhanced by twinkling lights, meant to depict stars, with the fog machine removed. News journalist Walter Cronkite was the new narrator, reading from an updated script. Two new scenes were added before the network operations center, on the left side of the track, featuring a woman working in a ‚Äúpaperless office‚Äù and a boy at a computer in his bedroom (the right side, featuring a woman observing technical read outs, remained the same). A theme song called \\"Tomorrow's Child\\" was composed for the ending of the attraction, which was redesigned with projected images of children on screens to fit the theme of \\"Tomorrow's Child\\". Between August 15 and November 23, 1994, the attraction was closed to receive a major remodel. This third version of the attraction kept the lighted tunnel as it was in 1986, and it maintained the majority of the scenes depicted in the beginning and middle of the attraction. Three 1980s scenes toward the end of the attraction were removed: a computer in a boy's bedroom, a woman's office, and a network operations center. These were replaced with a single scene depicting a boy and girl using the Internet to communicate between America and Asia. The ride received an updated script narrated by Jeremy Irons. A new orchestral composition, based upon Bach's Sinfonia No. 2 in C Minor, was composed for the entire attraction. The ending was completely redone, with the updating of the projected Earth and removal of the Space Station scene from the planetarium (the Space Station astronauts subsequently turned up in Space Mountain's post-show, where they were used until 2009) as well as the replacement of the 1982 and 1986 ending scenes with miniature architectural settings that were connected by color-changing fiber-optic cables, and arrays of blinking lights, representing electronic communication pathways. ===Wand and update=== Spaceship Earth with the Mickey Mouse wand, added in 2000 and removed in 2007 In celebration of the year 2000, a 25-story \\"magic wand\\" held by a representation of Mickey Mouse's hand was built next to the sphere. Inspiration for it came from the Sorcerer's Apprentice sequence of Fantasia (although Mickey did not actually use a magic wand in that sequence). At the top of the structure was a large cut-out of the number 2000. This structure was constructed to have a lifetime of about 10 years, and it was left standing after the Millennium Celebration ended. In 2001, the number 2000 was replaced with the word \\"Epcot\\" in a script font that differed from the park's logotype. On July 5, 2007, Epcot Vice President Jim MacPhee announced that Spaceship Earth would be restored to its original appearance, and that the \\"magic wand\\" structure would be removed in time for the park's 25th anniversary on October 1, 2007. It was rumored that Siemens AG, the new sponsor of Spaceship Earth, requested the wand be removed as it did not fit their corporate image. The attraction was closed on July 9, 2007, and by October 1 the wand structure, the stars and their supports were gone, replaced by palm trees and other plants. Components of the structure were later auctioned on eBay. Spaceship Earth seen from within the park in 2016 The closure also saw the ride's fourth update, which included new scenes and modifications to existing scenes, some new costumes, lighting, and props, a new musical score by Bruce Broughton, new narration by Judi Dench, and a new interactive ending. New scenes showed a Greek classroom, mainframe computers and the creation of the personal computer. The attraction opened for \\"soft launch\\" previews starting in December 2007. After some last-minute adjustments in January, the ride had its official re-opening on February 15, 2008. The \\"time machine\\" vehicles now have an interactive screen where riders can choose their vision of the future. This resembles a similar idea to the now-defunct Horizons attraction. At the beginning of the ride, a camera takes riders' pictures (using facial recognition technology) which are used at the end of the ride to conduct an interactive experience about the future of technology, featuring the riders' faces on animated characters, with narration by Cam Clarke. Visitors are now also asked where in our Spaceship Earth they live; this is used in the post- show area where a map of the world is displayed with the riders' faces shown where they live. On June 30, 2017, Siemens, a long-time sponsor, announced they would end their sponsorship of the attraction, as well as the firework show, IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth. The last official day of Siemens sponsorship was on October 10, 2017. ===World Celebration update=== On August 25, 2019, it was announced that, as part of a multi-year renovation of Epcot, Future World would become three new areas: World Celebration, World Discovery and World Nature. Spaceship Earth would become a part of World Celebration, and would be updated with a new narrative about the human experience and the art of storytelling. An ethereal \\"story light\\" would guide guests as they travel through the attraction. The attraction's new exit would be Dreamers Point, an elevated area which would present a panoramic view of the park and would feature a lush garden with a \\"wishing tree\\", an interactive fountain, and a statue of Walt Disney. On July 15, 2020, when EPCOT officially reopened, both \\"Spaceship Earth: Our Shared Story\\" as well as the Mary Poppins attraction's sequences were removed from the EPCOT Experience. When asked for comment, a spokesperson for Disney said, \\"As with most businesses during this period, we are further evaluating long-term project plans. The decision was made to postpone development of the 'Mary Poppins'-inspired attraction and Spaceship Earth at this time.\\" ==Ride experience== As the ride was built on an omnimover system, there were no triggered ride events. Rather, a narration plays as the show scenes and music run on loop. The script, originally penned by Ray Bradbury, has since been updated to meet contemporary technological trends. The current narrator is Judi Dench, who is accompanied by an orchestral score by Bruce Broughton. ===Show scenes=== Audio-animatronic cavemen in the first scene of the ride, seen in 2005. The scene has since been updated with new figures and an animated background. The ride begins with the time-machine vehicles ascending into a dark tunnel with twinkling stars all around. An adventurous orchestral theme starts to play. As the score shifts to the theme ostinato, a leitmotif that comes to represent digital interference, guests have their picture taken which, unknown to the riders, will be used later in the ride and in the post-show. As the vehicle arrives at the first story of the structure, it begins a slow curve. A large film screen is stretched along the inside of the sphere, depicting early humans fighting for survival against a woolly mammoth without a form of communication and language. As the screen dims behind them, guests enter a cavern populated by audio animatronic early humans, who represent the development of early language through cave paintings. The drawings on the walls come to life and begin to dance as the car continues onward. The score modulates, presenting the theme in a phrygian mode, implying a middle eastern atmosphere. Guests are brought through a heated diorama of the Egyptians, who invented a system of portable communication using hieroglyphs recorded on papyrus, as opposed to cave paintings that were unable to be transported as humans migrated. The Phoenicians animatronics in an early scene from the ride discussing how our modern alphabet evolved Phoenician merchants are seen carrying goods to faraway lands. The narration explains how each civilization is trying to communicate, but cannot understand each other due to the language barrier. But the Phoenicians, who trade with all of them create a simple common alphabet, so that trade and communication becomes easier. Turning a corner, riders see a lesson in mathematics being taught in a piazza in an ancient Greek city, in a sequence that attempts to show how math helped invent the 'birth of a high tech life we enjoy today.' Shifting to ancient Rome, a night scene including a traveler in a chariot delivering news depicts how language is portrayed as a tool for cultural unification with the vast network of roads that stretched across Europe, ultimately all leading to Rome. Suddenly, the scene takes a dark turn as crashes are heard and the smell of Rome burning fills the air. The fall of Rome by invading mercenary armies also brought the destruction of the bulk of the world's recorded knowledge, including the loss of scrolls at the Library of Alexandria. But the narration gives hope as the vehicle reaches the next level, where Jewish and Islamic scholars of the Middle Ages are seen preserving recorded information, and continuing to progress in science. Winding through exotic fabrics and drapery, guests arrive at a monastery where biblical manuscripts are being copied by hand. The composition shifts to a hallelujah chorus, sung to the melody of the piece's exposition. Gutenberg is seen working the first movable-type printing press, allowing information to travel freely across the globe. The European Renaissance is portrayed, with animatronics of ensembles playing rich, polyphonic secular motets, sculpting a woman, and the painting of a portrait of fruit. The scene ends as the car passes under a scaffold, where Michelangelo is seen painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. The time machines transition to a post-Civil War North. Guests witness syndicated news reports illuminating the planet of current events with amazing efficiency. Loud, industrial-sized printing presses show the incredible influence of the machine as an advancement in mass communication. As guests pass the clanging sounds of the press, the score's theme is presented again, this time with an uptempo ragtime piano. Seen next is a romanticized version of the 20th century communications revolution‚Äîafter passing telegraphs, radio, telephones, and movies, riders see the 1969 television broadcast of Apollo 11 landing on the moon, featuring Walter Cronkite. Riders hear Neil Armstrong say his most famous quote, \\"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\\" while the vehicles pass by the TV. Language had progressed to such an extent that it no longer was spoken solely by humans, but by machines as well. Guests turn a corner and find themselves in a large mainframe computer as they ascend up the final hill. At the top, a slow descent starts, progressing through a garage in California, where a man is seen building one of the first home computers. The score becomes suddenly percussive and dramatic as guests fly through a tunnel with computer code projected onto the walls. At a crescendo, the car makes its final turn into the cupola of Spaceship Earth. The top of the structure is, in fact, a planetarium studded with stars and a large projection of a rotating Earth. Before the omnimover vehicles start to move down the long descent to the unloading area, they rotate 180 degrees clockwise and guests ride the end of the attraction backwards. The final scene has been redone multiple times, most recently to remove the animatronic scenes. The remainder of the ride moves past a seemingly infinite number of stars and into a realm of glowing triangles. The guests can then use the touch-screens in their Omnimover vehicle to fill out a questionnaire to create a possible depiction of their future, which uses the pictures taken at the beginning of the ride. Guests are then invited to visit Project Tomorrow as they exit the ride cars. ===Post- show=== ====Earth Station==== The original post show for Spaceship Earth was called Earth Station. It lasted from 1982 until 1994. It was a wide open exhibit space that included: *EPCOT Center Guest Relations *Seven large rear projector screens mounted on the walls of the exhibit space toward the ceiling that displayed visual previews of various EPCOT Center attractions. *WorldKey Information: Interactive kiosks that offered previews of various EPCOT Center attractions. Guests could also talk to a live cast member via two-way closed- circuit video, or make a restaurant reservation while in the park. ====Global Neighborhood==== When AT&T; renewed their sponsorship in 1994, they redesigned the exhibit space for Earth Station into the Global Neighborhood. The original Global Neighborhood lasted from 1994 until 1999. In 1999, the exhibit space was updated to become the New Global Neighborhood for the Millennium Celebration. The exhibit space closed in 2004 after AT&T; left as sponsor. ====Project Tomorrow: Inventing the Wonders of the Future==== AT&T;'s departure as sponsor in 2004 caused the exhibit to close. Siemens AG, the newest sponsor of Spaceship Earth, having signed on in 2005, created a new exhibit space called Project Tomorrow: Inventing the Wonders of the Future. The new exhibit space once again uses the entire exhibit space that only Earth Station had once used. The new exhibit space houses interactive exhibits featuring various Siemens AG technology. These interactive displays and games allow guests to see the future of medicine, transportation and energy management. The space opened with two games, with two new games added in December 2007 and January 2008. After Siemens dropped their sponsorships, all signs mentioning them were removed, however the name stayed the same. Project Tomorrow current attractions are: * An illuminated globe that shows the hometown of all Spaceship Earth visitors for the day. * Body Builder ‚Äì a 3-D game that challenges guests to reconstruct a human body. Features the voice of Wallace Shawn as Dr. Bones. * Super Driver ‚Äì a driving simulation video game featuring vehicle accident and avoidance systems. It simulates what is supposed to be the future of driving. You drive a \\"smart-car\\" and try to stop the city from being destroyed. * Power City ‚Äì a large, digital \\"shuffleboard- style\\" game that has guest racing around the board to power their city. * InnerVision ‚Äì a coordination and reaction-time game with elements similar to Simon and Dance Dance Revolution ====VIP Lounge==== A VIP lounge, operated by the pavilion sponsor, exists above the post-show area of Spaceship Earth. Employees of the current sponsoring company and their guests can relax in the lounge while visiting Epcot. The sponsor can also hold receptions in the space as well as conduct workshops and business presentations. When Spaceship Earth was without sponsorship from 2004 to 2005, the room was utilized for private events such as weddings and conventions. The layout is small and curved in shape, with one wall consisting of large windows where visitors can look out onto the park.

A hose clamp or hose clip or hose lock is a device used to attach and seal a hose onto a fitting such as a barb or nipple. == Types == Many types are available, including : === Screw/band (worm gear) clamps === Screw clamps consist of a band, often galvanized or stainless steel, into which a screw thread pattern has been cut or pressed. One end of the band contains a captive screw. The clamp is put around the hose or tube to be connected, with the loose end being fed into a narrow space between the band and the captive screw. When the screw is turned, it acts as a worm drive pulling the threads of the band, causing the band to tighten around the hose (or when screwed the opposite direction, to loosen). Screw clamps are normally used for hoses 1/2 inch diameter and up, with other clamps used for smaller hoses. The first patent for a worm-drive hose clamp was granted to Swedish inventor in 1896 Bergstr√∂m founded ‚ÄúAllm√§nna Brandredskapsaff√§ren E. Bergstr√∂m & Co.‚Äù in 1896 (ABA) to manufacture these worm gear clamps. Other names for the worm gear hose clamp include worm drive clamp, worm gear clips, clamps, band clamps, hose clips, and genericized names such as Jubilee Clip. Many public organizations maintain hose clamp standards, such as Aerospace Industries Association's National Aerospace Standards NAS1922 and NAS1924, the Society of Automotive Engineers' J1508, etc. Pairs of screw clamps on a short rubber tube form a \\"no-hub band,\\" often used for attaching sections of domestic wastewater piping, or used for other pipes as a flexible coupler (to fix alignment difficulties or to prevent pipe breakage due to relative movement of sections) or an emergency repair. A hose clamp used to hold the leather in place while tying-in the bag of bagpipes.They can also be used in a similar way, as a simple means for the transmission of small amounts of power. A short length of hose is clipped between two shafts where vibration or variations in alignment may be taken up by the flexibility of the hose. This technique is well adapted to use for mock-ups in a development laboratory. This type of clamp was marketed in 1921 by ex Royal Navy Commander, Lumley Robinson, who founded L. Robinson & Co (Gillingham) Ltd., a business in Gillingham, Kent. The company owns the trademark for Jubilee Clip. Similar types of clamps for hoses include the Marman clamp, which also has a screw band and a solid screw. Interlocking plastic clamps, where the large Fin Clip Base is designed for overlocking and interlocking the jaw to the required tightness. T clamps are designed for high pressure pipes and hoses such as turbo pressure hoses and coolant hoses for high pressure engines. These clamps have a small grub screw that pulls the two halves of the clamp together to securely fasten heavy duty hoses. === Spring clamps === A pair of spring clamps, intended for use on automotive fuel lines Spring clamps are typically made from a strip of spring steel, cut so that one side has a narrow protrusion centered on the end, and the other side a pair of narrow protrusions on either side. The ends of these protrusions are then bent outwards, and the strip rolled to form a ring, with the protruding tabs intermeshing. To use the clamp, the exposed tabs are pressed towards each other (typically using pliers), increasing the diameter of the ring, and the clamp is slid onto the hose, past the portion that will go onto the barb. The hose is then fit onto the barb, the clamp expanded again, slid onto the portion of the hose over the barb, then released, compressing the hose onto the barb. Clamps of this design are rarely used for high pressures or large hoses, as they would require unwieldy amounts of steel to generate enough clamping force, and be impossible to work with using just hand tools. They are commonly used on automotive cooling system hoses several inches in diameter, for example on most water-cooled Volkswagen automobiles. Spring clamps are particularly suited for confined or otherwise awkward places where other clip types would require tightening tools applied from narrow and possibly inaccessible angles. This has made them particularly popular for applications such as automotive engine bays and for securing barb connections in PC water- cooling. vacuum hose Another type of spring clamp, typically only used on vacuum hoses, is just a piece of spring steel wire bent into a loop, with the ends curled to provide handles. These are used similar to standard spring clamps, but are just pinched by hand, and provide very little clamping force. Rather than attempting to seal a hose into a barb, they just place a slight pressure on the hose, helping to keep it from sliding off the barb. radiator === Wire clamps === Wire clamps consist of a piece of heavy wire, typically made of steel, first bent into a tight U, then formed into a ring shape with one end overlapping the other, and finally the ends bent outwards and cut. A captive nut is attached to one end, and a captive screw is attached to the other end. When the screw is tightened, the overlapped ends of the wire are pushed apart, tightening the wire loop around the hose. For an explanation of why this design is used, see the section on sealing the connection. === Ear Clamps === Ear Clamps consist of a band (usually stainless steel) into which one or more ‚Äúears‚Äù or closing elements have been formed. The clamp is placed over the end of the hose or tube to be connected and when each ear is closed at the base of the ear with a special pincer tool, it permanently deforms, pulling the band, and causing the band to tighten around the hose. The size of clamp should be chosen such that the ear(s) are almost completely closed on installation. Other features of this style of clamp include: narrow band widths, intended to provide a concentrated compression of the hose or tube; and tamper resistance, due to the permanent deformation of the clamp‚Äôs ‚Äúear‚Äù. If closure of the clamp ‚Äúear(s)‚Äù is performed to manufacturer's recommendations, which generally provide for constant jaw force, the sealing effect is not unduly sensitive to component tolerance variations. Some such clamps feature dimples intended to provide a spring effect when the diameter of the hose or tube contracts or expands due to thermal or mechanical effects. A stepless type of ear clamp was invented by Hans Oetiker in Horgen, Switzerland, which eliminates steps or gaps on the inner circumference of the clamp. This is said to provide uniform compression and a 360¬∞ seal. Such stepless clamps are claimed to be well suited to applications involving thin- walled hoses, supposedly with higher retained loads. This suggests they should be considered for difficult to seal applications such as molded plastics or other less malleable materials, commonly used in the automotive industry. === Other methods === Many other methods can be used to attach hoses or tubing, such as compression fittings (where a nylon or soft metal ferrule is compressed onto the hose by the tightening of the fitting), push-fit fittings (where the hose is inserted inside of a compression sleeve, designed such that force against the hose causes the sleeve to tighten), swage fittings (where a stiff collar is compressed onto the hose), clamp fittings (where two blocks are tightened onto the sides of the hose, often found on garden hoses), crimp banding (similar to worm gear banding but a crimp is used instead of a screw/thread), and a multitude of others. However, these devices are not typically referred to as hose clamps. == Uses and applications == Hose clamps are typically limited to moderate pressures, such as those found in automotive and home applications. At high pressures, especially with large hose sizes, the clamp would have to be unwieldy to be able to withstand the forces expanding it without allowing the hose to slide off the barb or a leak to form. For these high pressure applications, compression fittings, thick crimp fittings, or other designs are normally used. Hose clamps are frequently used for things other than their intended use, and are often used as a more permanent version of duct tape wherever a tightening band around something would be useful. The screw band type in particular is very strong, and is used for non-plumbing purposes far more than the other types. These clamps can be found doing everything from mounting signs to holding together emergency (or otherwise) home repairs. Another handy attribute: worm-drive hose clamps can be daisy-chained or \\"siamesed\\" to make a long clamp, if you have several, shorter than the job requires. Some things seen assembled with hose clamps include the tail boom on a GMP Cricket model helicopter, a homemade gas scooter, makeshift pipe hangers, mounts for rooftop TV and shortwave antennas, and virtually every imaginable automobile body component. Hose clamps are commonly used in the agriculture industry as well. They are used on Anhydrous Ammonia hoses and are made from a combination of steel and iron. Anhydrous ammonia hose clamps are often cadmium plated to prevent rust and corrosion. http://www.continentalnh3.com/clamp-type-couplings.html == Sealing and mechanical strength == One of the fundamental goals of most hose clamps is to ensure a tight seal between the hose and the barb, preventing the working fluid from escaping. To this goal, they are designed to provide even pressure on all sides, with no gaps. An example of this would be wire clamps. An obvious design would seem to be simply having a wire around the hose, one end attached to a nut, and the other end to the screw, and when tightened, pulling the ends of the wire towards each other. However, this will leave a gap where no pressure is applied (underneath the screw), and cause a leak. To combat this, the more complicated and weaker design of having the ends overlap and then be pushed apart from each other is used, as this ensures pressure around the entire circumference of the hose. To ensure a good seal, the barb, hose nipple, or beaded tube must be smooth and free of nicks, scratches, or contamination. Stuck hoses should never be removed by slitting them, as this can leave a scratch on the fitting which will cause a leak. The other goal of a hose clamp is to provide mechanical attachment keeping the hose attached to a barb, hose nipple, or tube. To do this the clamp is typically placed on the hose behind the first ramp of the barb or behind the raised area near the end of and completely around the circumference of the hose nipple or tube called a bead. If the hose were to slide the clamp would have to expand to fit over the barb or raised bead. This keeps the hose attached to the barb, hose nipple, or beaded tube. == Specifications == Within the United States, SAE International maintains Specification J1508 for thirty-two different hose clamp designs, including screw, spring, and t-bolt styles. It also maintains Specification J1610 for the testing the sealing of hoses. The US Army TACOM maintains Commercial Item Description (CID) A-A-52506 that provides for the standardized acquisition of hose clamps by the Department of Defense; the CID references the SAE specifications. The CID superseded Federal Specification WW-C-440 for hose clamps in 1994. == References == ==External links == * Hose Clamp Tightens Like Belt To Keep Hose Leak Proof August 1944 column with photo showing new worm gear hose clamp -- i.e. at bottom of page * Timeline for Oetiker 1942-2007 (inventor of ear clamp Category:Mechanical fasteners Category:Hoses Category:Seals (mechanical) Category:Swedish inventions ","title":"Hose clamp"},{"id":"1426037","text":"Miranda do Douro Pauliteiros in Festa do Avante! of 2005.

The MGM-166 LOSAT (Line-of- Sight Anti-Tank) was a United States anti-tank missile system designed by Lockheed Martin (originally Vought) to defeat tanks and other individual targets. Instead of using a High Explosive Anti-Tank warhead like other anti- tank missiles, the LOSAT employed a solid steel kinetic energy penetrator to punch through armor. The LOSAT is fairly light; it was designed to be mounted onto a Humvee while allowing the vehicle to remain air-portable. LOSAT eventually emerged on an extended-length heavy-duty Humvee with a hard-top containing four KEMs used by special operations. Although LOSAT never \\"officially\\" entered service, it was used for the smaller Compact Kinetic Energy Missile.LOSAT LINE-OF-SIGHT ANTI-TANK WEAPON - HIGH MOBILITY MULTI- PURPOSE WHEELED VEHICLE, USA ==History== ===HVM=== LOSAT developed out of an earlier Vought project, the HVM. HVM was a multi-platform weapon supported by the US Air Force, for their A-10, and by the US Army and US Marine Corps, for helicopters and other vehicles. HVM offered performance similar to existing systems like the AGM-114 Hellfire but offered a semi-fire-and-forget operation through the use of FLIR tracking and guidance commands sent to it via a low- power laser. It could be carried on any platform that had FLIR support, with the self-contained command guidance system able to be carried externally, or potentially integrated into existing target designators. With the end of the Cold War, the Air Force pulled out of the project, and development work on HVM appears to have ended in the late 1980s. ===AAWS-H=== At about the same time, in 1988, the Army released a new requirement for a ground-based anti-tank system, known as Advanced Anti-Tank Weapon System - Heavy, or AAWS-H for short.Lockheed Martin MGM-166 LOSAT/KEM - Designation Systems AAWS-H specified an air-liftable lightweight system with the capability to knock out any existing or near-future tank outside its own gun range. The TOW missile could be guided from concealed locations, but did not offer the needed range and its relatively slow flight speeds (~250 m/s versus 1650 for HVM) left it vulnerable to counterattack from the target while the missile was in flight. To fill AAWS-H, Vought developed a slightly larger extended-range version of HVM known as KEM (Kinetic Energy Missile), while their partner, Texas Instruments, provided a new FLIR targeting system that they were already working on as a TOW upgrade. Several vehicles were studied to mount the system, including the front-runner M2 Bradley,LIGHT AND LETHAL: Line-of-Sight, Anti-Tank (LOSAT) as well as the M8 Armored Gun System.M8 Armored Gun System However, in order to reduce costs and improve air mobility in a post‚ÄìCold War world, LOSAT eventually emerged on an extended-length heavy-duty Humvee with a hard-top containing four KEMs ready to fire, along with a trailer containing another eight rounds in two-round packs. The new guidance system could keep two missiles in flight to separate targets, allowing the vehicle to salvo fire its weapons against a tank squadron in a few seconds. Reaching speeds of 5,000 ft/s, LOSAT was in the air from launch to maximum range for under four seconds, making counterfire extremely difficult. The range was beyond that of existing main tank guns, allowing the LOSAT to fire and move before tanks could maneuver into a position to return fire. The first KEMs were test fired in 1990, and a contract for continued development was placed by the Army. This was much slower in pace, and it was only in 1997 that an Advanced Technology Concept Demonstrator program started to bring the system to production quality. The contract called for 12 LOSAT vehicles and 144 KEMs, to be delivered by 2003. Even before this contract was complete, the Army asked for a production run of another 108 missiles in August 2002. The first of the 12 LOSAT units was delivered in October 2002, and the system began a series of 18 production-qualification test firings in August 2003, at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. By March 2004, 18 KEMs had been fired at targets under a variety of conditions, both during the day and night. Another 8 were fired in the summer of 2004 at Fort Bliss as part of a user-testing exercise. ===Cancellation=== By the time the test program was finished it was obvious the Army was going to cancel LOSAT after the low-rate initial production (LRIP) batch of about 435 missiles was delivered. By this point the Army had already started work on a system known as the Compact Kinetic Energy Missile (or CKEM), based on the LOSAT concepts but smaller and lighter, more in tune with real-world threats. As it turned out, even the LRIP contract was never funded, and the LOSAT program terminated. ==Notes== ==External links== *Globalsecurity article on the LOSAT *Video of LOSAT in action Category:Anti- tank missiles of the United States Category:Abandoned military rocket and missile projects of the United States ","title":"MGM-166 LOSAT"},{"id":"1426074","text":"Prince of Wales College (PWC) is a former university college, which was located in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada. PWC merged with St. Dunstan's University in 1969 to form the University of Prince Edward Island. PWC traces its history to 1804 when land was set aside by Lieutenant-Governor Edmund Fanning for a college - the colony's first. In 1821 a district school called the National School opened on the site located on Kent Street in the east end of Charlottetown. In 1835 Central Academy opened on a site along Grafton Street, immediately south of the National School. The National School closed in the early 1850s and the provincial Normal School for training teachers opened on the site in 1856. In 1860 the Central Academy was upgraded and renamed Prince of Wales College (PWC) in honour of a visit to the colony that year by the Prince of Wales, later to become King Edward VII.https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/tlctd10.txt The Project Gutenberg EBook #6466 of 'The Intellectual Development of the Canadian People, A historical review' by John George Bourinot, House of Commons, Ottawa, February 17th, 1881 In 1879, PWC became co-educational and the Normal School was merged into the institution. A significant expansion took place in the late 1920s and early 1930s when a new brick and stone campus was constructed on the site of the original PWC campus. Ferdinand Herbert Marani, an architect with Marani & Paisley designed the new PWC campus which opened in 1932.http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1462 Ferdinand Herbert Marani (architect) PWC remained a non-denominational or inter- denominational college which served to provide an education comparable to the present-day colleges in Quebec, namely senior matriculation and one or several years of university. It was the non-denominational character of PWC which led many of Island Roman Catholics to label the school as being \\"Protestant\\". Many Catholic women attended PWC despite this label because they were barred from attending St. Dunstan's University which was male-only. It was not until 1965 that the provincial government granted PWC a degree-granting charter and the only Bachelor's degrees from PWC were awarded in the spring 1969 convocation. PWC had several administrators who proved their importance to Prince Edward Island's education profession: * Dr. Alexander Anderson served as professor 1862‚Äì1868 and principal of PWC from 1868‚Äì1901, having influenced many islanders, including Lucy Maud Montgomery. * Dr. Samuel Napier Robertson served as professor and took over as principal of PWC following Anderson's move into the provincial civil service, serving in that role from 1901 to 1937. * G.

Sixteen other PWC faculty resigned soon after.Bruce, Marian - A Century of Excellence: Prince of Wales College, 1860-1969 - Island Studies Press 2005 * Thomas M. Lothian a biology professor became interim principal from 1968 until its dissolution in 1969.Bruce, Marian - A Century of Excellence: Prince of Wales College, 1860-1969 - Island Studies Press 2005 PWC held high academic standards for its students and as early as the 1910s, McGill University entered into talks related to integrating PWC as its Atlantic coast counterpart to the University of Victoria, which McGill had also helped to establish and nurture. Master plans had called for quadrupling the size of the PWC Grafton Street campus to encompass most of what is now the eastern end of downtown Charlottetown with the proposed PWC-McGill campus being built along the area bounded by Grafton, Prince, Kent, and Edward Streets in a massive redevelopment of the community. The plans did not come to fruition and by the 1960s, the provincial government began a critical study of its post-secondary education institutions (PWC and SDU), concluding that a merger to form a provincial university was the desired funding and service model for future students. The merger was not without controversy as emotions ran their course on the part of supporters of both institutions, however, in May 1969 the last classes graduated from PWC and SDU and the institutions were merged into the University of Prince Edward Island which opened for the first time in September 1969 on the now-former SDU campus. The PWC campus on Grafton Street was taken over by the provincial government and became part of UPEI during the early period of amalgamation. By the early 1970s it was the Charlottetown campus of a new provincial community college named Holland College. ==References== ==External links== * Prince of Wales College history - provided by UPEI Category:Defunct universities and colleges in Canada Category:Educational institutions established in 1804 Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 1969 Category:Education in Charlottetown Category:University of Prince Edward Island Category:1804 establishments in Canada Category:1969 disestablishments in Prince Edward Island Category:Colleges in Prince Edward Island ","title":"Prince of Wales College"},{"id":"1426078","text":"The Edmonton Folk Music Festival (EFMF) is an annual four-day outdoor music event held the second weekend of August in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, established in 1980 by Don Whalen.

During the daytime hours of the festival, there are six active stages hosting workshops and concerts.\\" 2016 Edmonton Folk Fest an understated, wonderful weekend\\". Edmonton Sun, By Fish Griwkowsky. August 07, 2016 Food vendors number in the dozens, ranging from carnival fare to vegetarian and world cuisine. A tent village houses craftspeople and there is a CD tent where the performers' albums can be purchased. There is also a large and busy beer garden, which serves more beer than any other single event in western Canada. The EFMF relies heavily on volunteers which keeps ticket prices down. Volunteers do everything from picking garbage to working as stage hands. There are over 2700 people on the volunteer list each year. The EFMF is held at Gallagher Park, on the southern slope of the North Saskatchewan River valley. During the winter the area is a ski club. The mainstage audience seating is a natural amphitheatre with great sightlines. The skyline of downtown Edmonton acts as a backdrop for the stage. For two years, a fifth evening of music was added, with revenue from that concert being dedicated to the festival's endowment fund. Since 2011, the festival has been four days. The festival is extremely successful, and has sold out for 21 years (as of 2015)(12,000 weekend passes and 1,000 single-day tickets evenly divided between in-person and online sales) in just minutes.https://edmontonjournal.com/news/Folk+Fest+sells+record+time/6714996/story.html#ixzz235X1F0AA ==Performers== The Edmonton Folk Music Festival has hosted musicians from six continents, including acts from Cuba, Mexico, Brazil, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Kenya, Mongolia, China, India, and Tuva. The majority of performers come from Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The festival showcases performers in many genres. Most years, folk, Celtic, bluegrass, blues, gospel, roots, and worldbeat acts perform. Global representation is a major part of the festival, with musicians travelling from North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia every year. Past main stage performers include k.d. lang, Joni Mitchell, Blue Rodeo, Stan Rogers, Great Big Sea, Oysterband, Loreena McKennitt, Norah Jones, Steve Earle, The Blind Boys Of Alabama, David Gray, Neko Case, Van Morrison, David Byrne, Michael Franti, Hanggai, K'Naan, and Passenger. In addition to mainstage and sidestage concerts by individual artists, the festival has artists collaborate on shared stages. Each year, the festival showcases local Edmonton performers, from youth to young adults to seasoned performers. ==History== The first edition of the festival was organized as part of the 75th anniversary celebrations of Alberta, and was held in Gold Bar Park, moving to its current venue in 1981. 2020 was the first year in the history of the festival where the event was cancelled, due to COVID-19. ===Artistic directors=== *1980-1985 Don Whalen *1986-1988 Holger Petersen *1989‚Äìpresent Terry Wickham ==See also== *List of festivals in Edmonton *List of festivals in Alberta *List of music festivals in Canada * ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Edmonton Folk Music Festival Official website *Edmonton Folk Music Festival Programs (archive) Category:Folk festivals in Canada Category:Music festivals in Edmonton Category:1980 establishments in Alberta Category:Music festivals established in 1980 ","title":"Edmonton Folk Music Festival"},{"id":"1426087","text":"Piroxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the oxicam class used to relieve the symptoms of painful inflammatory conditions like arthritis. Piroxicam works by preventing the production of endogenous prostaglandins which are involved in the mediation of pain, stiffness, tenderness and swelling. The medicine is available as capsules, tablets and (not in all countries) as a prescription-free gel 0.5%. It is also available in a betadex formulation, which allows a more rapid absorption of piroxicam from the digestive tract. Piroxicam is one of the few NSAIDs that can be given parenteral routes. It was patented in 1968 by Pfizer and approved for medical use in 1979. It became generic in 1992, and is marketed worldwide under many brandnames. ==Medical uses== It is used in the treatment of rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, primary dysmenorrhoea, postoperative pain; and act as an analgesic, especially where there is an inflammatory component. The European Medicines Agency issued a review of its use in 2007 and recommended that its use be limited to the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions, as it is only in these circumstances that its risk-benefit ratio proves to be favourable. ==Adverse effects== As with other NSAIDs the principal side effects include: digestive complaints like nausea, discomfort, diarrhoea and bleeds or ulceration of the stomach, as well as headache, dizziness, nervousness, depression, drowsiness, insomnia, vertigo, hearing disturbances (such as tinnitus), high blood pressure, oedema, light sensitivity, skin reactions (including, albeit rarely, Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and rarely, kidney failure, pancreatitis, liver damage, visual disturbances, pulmonary eosinophilia and alveolitis. Compared to other NSAIDs it is more prone to causing gastrointestinal disturbances and serious skin reactions.

The Sausage Race is a race of sausage mascots held before the bottom of the sixth inning at every home game of the Milwaukee Brewers. The Sausage Race began as a promotion for the Klement's Sausage Company, located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, whose sausages were served at Miller Park (and previously at Milwaukee County Stadium), the home of the Brewers. In 2018, Johnsonville sausages began being served at Miller Park and today are officially known as the Famous Racing Sausages. ==Famous Racing Sausages== The race started in the early 1990s with just three sausages ‚Äì the bratwurst, the Polish sausage (kielbasa), and the Italian sausage. Since then, two new sausages have joined the race ‚Äì the hot dog, introduced in the mid-1990s, and the chorizo, which was unveiled and eventually joined the race in the mid-2000s.How it All Started Brett Wurst, the bratwurst, at the grand opening of the West Milwaukee Pick 'n Save Today, the five racing sausages are known as \\"Brat\\", \\"Polish\\", \\"Italian\\", \\"Hot Dog\\" and \\"Chorizo\\". Employees of the Milwaukee Brewers or Miller Park usually run the race. Donning over-sized foam sausage costumes that measure seven feet, three inches (2.21 meters) from the top of the head to the knees of the runners, the contestants start their race between the dugout and the baseline around third base. They sprint down the warning track, around home plate and continue toward first base. On Sunday afternoon home games, the Sausages tag off to miniature versions of themselves, dubbed the Little Weenies, who finish the remainder of the race. The sausages appear at many local charity events, including an annual 5K run/walk in their honor, with proceeds going to Brewers Community Foundation, and are available for personal appearances on non-game days. They also have a twice yearly home-and-home relay race against their Pittsburgh Pirates counterparts, the Racing Pierogies. The sausages have starred in two SportsCenter spots for ESPN. The first, set at ESPN's cafeteria, was shown at Miller Park on May 19, 2006. The second features them in a parody of the Running of the Bulls with ESPN employees. ==History== The sausages prepare to race. ===Origins=== The Famous Sausage Race began as a scoreboard animation in the early 1990s with just three characters ‚Äì The Bratwurst, The Polish and The Italian ‚Äì running toward Milwaukee County Stadium against a backdrop of the city of Milwaukee. In the fall of 1992, Milwaukee graphic designer Michael Dillon of McDill Design presented an idea to Gabe Paul who was the Vice President of Operations for the Brewers, to transform the race from the scoreboard to live action. On June 27, 1993, as the Sausages approached Milwaukee County Stadium on the scoreboard video, the left field doors swung open and ‚Äì much to the surprise of players and fans ‚Äì out came the larger-than-life mascots. The three made their way to home plate with The Bratwurst (worn by Dillon) winning the first-ever live race. For the remainder of the 1993 season, the Sausages raced live only at those games with particularly high attendance. In 1994, the live Sausage race resumed on Sunday, May 29 ‚Äì the day the Brewers retired Robin Yount‚Äôs number 19 jersey ‚Äì and became a fixture at every home game since. At the outset, the Sausage Race featured only three entrants: The bratwurst, the Polish sausage, and the Italian sausage. The Hot Dog joined the race in the middle-1990s. In 2007, after a one-race tryout the previous year, The Chorizo rounded out the group of five Sausages fans see today.Brewers/Klements Racing Sausages - A Historical Perspective ===Randall Simon incident=== On July 9, 2003, Randall Simon, then the first baseman of the Pittsburgh Pirates, hit the head of a runner's costume with a baseball bat. The tap didn't hit the actual head of Mandy Block, who was wearing the Italian sausage costume, but it did knock her over, and she took the hot dog down with her. The Polish sausage helped the Italian sausage up and all sausages finished the race. Simon was arrested, fined, and suspended by Major League Baseball for three games. He later apologized.http://old.post-gazette.com/pirates/20030711simon0711p3.asp Block asked only that the offending bat be autographed and given to her. Simon obliged. Later that year, Mandy Block received a complimentary trip to Cura√ßao, Simon's home island, from the Cura√ßao Tourism Board. Since the incident, T-shirts and other memorabilia have been sold with the slogan \\"Don't whack our wiener!\\" Pittsburgh lost the game 2‚Äì1.http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/22719679/the-bobblehead- project-randall-simon-vs-racing-sausage Simon was traded to the Chicago Cubs later that season for reasons unrelated to the incident. He returned to Milwaukee with the Cubs for a series against the Brewers. During the first game, Simon's teammates playfully held him back as the sausages raced past their dugout, and manager Dusty Baker guarded the bat rack. In that same game, Simon purchased Italian sausages for a randomly chosen section of the crowd. ===Parodies=== On October 1, 2008, the Brewers traveled to Philadelphia to play the Philadelphia Phillies in Milwaukee's first post-season game since the 1982 World Series. In the middle of the 6th inning, three feebly dressed sausages appeared from the left field gate of Citizens Bank Park in what proved to be a mockery of the Miller Park tradition. The three sausages were then accosted by the Phillie Phanatic at home plate, to the delight of the Phillies fans. Simon, who played for the Phillies in 2006, was invited back and received loud cheers as he hit the fake sausages with a large plastic bat. Most fans understood the reference, and laughed that Simon was invited back for the gag. In Washington, DC, the Washington Nationals have made fun of them, calling them the \\"un-Racing Sausages\\" during Brewers visits to the nation's capital in the Presidents Race, featuring runners dressed in oversized costumes representing the four Presidents on Mount Rushmore ‚Äì George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt ‚Äî which began when Ted Lerner took over ownership of the team in 2006; the live action version replacing a computerized animation version. This stems from a negative response by Brewers management after the Nats invited them for match races similar to those with Pittsburgh's racing pierogies staged annually; however, the Brewers refused to partake in these events. As a response, the Nationals made cardboard copies of the Brewers' racers, naming them ‚ÄúUn-talian sausage,‚Äù ‚ÄúNo-Lish Sausage,‚Äù ‚ÄúNot-Dog,‚Äù ‚ÄúNot-Wurst,‚Äù and ‚ÄúChoriz-No.‚ÄùPresidents Mock Milwaukee With \\"Un-Racing Sausages\\", Let Teddy Win\\" Blog, 25 August 2009 ===The Chorizo joins the race=== Five sausages racing in 2012 after addition of the Chorizo (#5, left) The Chorizo was added for the 2006 season to commemorate Latino contributions to the game of baseball, as well as to acknowledge the Brewers' growing Latino fanbase.Chorizo represents growing Latino population in Wisconsin It ran its first race (and the only one of the 2006 season) on Saturday, July 29 to celebrate Cerveceros Day (cervecero translates to beer-maker or maker of beer, i.e., brewer, in Spanish; the Brewers also wore Cerveceros jerseys on this day). However, the Chorizo did not become a regular participant in the Sausage Race until the season because of an MLB rule stating that a team may not introduce a new mascot in the middle of a season. ===The Italian goes missing=== On February 27, 2013, news outlets reported that the Italian sausage costume was missing. According to police, eyewitnesses saw someone wearing the costume leaving the Milwaukee Curling Club in suburban Cedarburg the evening of February 16, proceeding to visit several bars in the area and pose for photographs with patrons before disappearing.Brewers' Italian Sausage is Missing Rewards offered for the costume's safe return included year's supplies of mustard and sauerkraut from local businesses, but these went unclaimed as the costume was ultimately dropped off in a hurry at a Cedarburg bar on February 28 by two unidentified men.Report: Sausage costume returned ===20th anniversary celebration=== On June 27, 2013, the Brewers and Klements sausage marked the 20th anniversary of the Sausage Race. The festivities, held during that day's Brewers game against the Chicago Cubs at Miller Park, featured pregame ceremonies honoring the Racing Sausages, a ceremonial first pitch by Michael Dillon (winner of the first live-action race in 1993), and the regular Sausage Race in the middle of the 6th inning that featured only 3 competitors‚Äîoriginal entrants bratwurst, Polish sausage, and Italian sausage (the hot dog and chorizo held the tape at the finish line).\\"20 years of racing ‚Äî sausages, that is,\\" from Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, 6/27/2013 ==Notable contestants== The regular sausages tag the Little Weenies.

Emmet Walsh and Kathy Bates. The movie is based on the novel No Beast So Fierce by Edward Bunker, who also acts in the movie. ==Plot summary== Max Dembo (Dustin Hoffman), lifelong thief, is released from a six-year stint in prison and forced to report to a boorish and condescending parole officer, Earl Frank (M. Emmet Walsh). One of the conditions of parole is that Max finds a job. At the employment agency, he meets Jenny Mercer (Theresa Russell), who helps him land scale-wage work at a can factory. Jenny accepts his invitation to dinner, where it's clear that she is smitten by this worldly and seemingly gentle ex-con. Earl pays a surprise visit to Max's room, finding a book of matches that Max's friend Willy Darin (Gary Busey) recently used to cook heroin. Although Max clearly has no track marks or other signs of drug abuse, he is handcuffed and dragged back to jail, out of a job and a home. Jenny visits him and gives him her number to call when he gets out. After urine tests prove he's clean, Max is picked up by a smug Earl, who feels he actually gave Max a break by not pursuing the fact that someone had been using drugs in his place of residence, which would result in three more years in prison. During their car ride to a halfway house, Earl pushes Max to name the user. Max, realizing he will never get a break, pummels Earl, takes control of his car, and handcuffs him to a highway divider fence with his pants around his ankles. This stunt now makes straight life impossible. Max returns to a life of crime, robbing a Chinese grocery store and planning bigger heists with some willing old accomplices. After robbing a bank together, Max and his friend Jerry Schue (Harry Dean Stanton) decide to up the ante and clean out a Beverly Hills jewelry store. The job is botched when Max takes too long in trying to steal everything. Willy, acting as getaway driver, panics and takes off, leaving Max and Jerry to flee on foot as police converge on the store. Jerry is shot and dies, while Max shoots a police officer. Max escapes with the loot, settles the score with Willy by killing him, and escapes L.A. with a loyal Jenny by his side. Outside the city limits, though, Max has second thoughts as to their prospects on the lam. He decides to leave Jenny at a gas station for her own good, telling her he will be caught no matter what as he drives away. ==Cast== * Dustin Hoffman as Max Dembo * Theresa Russell as Jenny Mercer * Gary Busey as Willy Darin * Harry Dean Stanton as Jerry Schue * M. Emmet Walsh as Earl Frank * Rita Taggart as Carol Schue * Kathy Bates as Selma Darin * Sandy Baron as Manny * Jake Busey as Henry Darin * Edward Bunker as Mickey ==Production== The screenplay was written by Alvin Sargent, Edward Bunker and Jeffrey Boam, based on Bunker's novel No Beast So Fierce. Dustin Hoffman was the director of the film when shooting began, but ultimately decided to give up that role, resulting in Grosbard being hired. This film both starred Gary Busey and introduced his seven-year-old son Jake. It was the second film for actress Theresa Russell; it also featured an early screen appearance by Kathy Bates. Busey went on to earn an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor as the lead in The Buddy Holly Story which was one of three films released between March and May 1978 in which he had a leading role; the other two were Straight Time and Big Wednesday. Russell's film career includes roles in Impulse and Whore. Bates would win the Academy Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award, playing deranged nurse Annie Wilkes in the Rob Reiner film Misery, as well as thirteen Emmy award nominations for her work in television. The film became the subject of litigation between Hoffman and the First Artists Production Company over creative control. Before Hoffman had finished editing the film, First Artists exercised a clause to take over the project since the shoot had gone 23 days over schedule and approximately $1 million over budget. Hoffman's lawsuit alleged that his right to the final cut had been violated and that the take-over clause did not mean he forfeited all creative control. First Artists' countersuit claimed that Hoffman's \\"derogatory statements\\" damaged the film's reception and box office performance.Kilday, Gregg (October 18, 1978). \\"Dustin Hoffman Vs.

(Ref: Film Credits) ==Reception== Vincent Canby of The New York Times praised Straight Time as \\"a leanly constructed, vividly staged film\\" that \\"makes no attempt to explain Max. It simply says that this is the way he is.

Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film four stars out of four and called it \\"a superior thriller, a riveting portrait of an ex-con,\\" adding, \\"Most criminals in American movies are drooling, trigger-happy psychotics. In 'Straight Time,' the criminals are people, and, somehow, that's more disturbing ...

Chicago Tribune. Section 6, p. 3. David Ansen of Newsweek wrote, \\"Though made up of familiar elements - an ex-con, bank robberies, lovers on the run - it is an unusual movie out of today's Hollywood and a very fine one. Small in scale, grittily realistic, charged with a fierce intelligence about how people live on the other side of the law, the film makes few concessions to an audience's expectations, but it has an edgy, lingering intensity.\\"Ansen, David (April 3, 1978). \\"Crime Junkie\\". Newsweek. 91. Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"riveting to watch from start to finish,\\" adding, \\"Hoffman's Max has less dimension than some of his earlier characterizations.

Los Angeles Times. Part II, p. 10-11. Arthur D. Murphy of Variety panned the film as \\"most unlikable\\" because Hoffman \\"cannot overcome the essentially distasteful and increasingly unsympathetic elements in the character.

Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote that there were \\"authentic, gripping moments in the film\\" but \\"in some unavoidable way [Hoffman] just doesn't look threatening and ruthless. You're tempted to console him rather than run from him. The cunning and aggression that one might accept immediately if actors like Robert De Niro or Harvey Keitel were cast as Max are only theoretically apparent in Hoffman.\\"Arnold, Gary (March 22, 1978). \\"Get It Straight, Dustin Hoffman\\".

In the following year the regiment returned to the United Kingdom, where the 1st Battalion was presented with its first colours by its Colonel-in-Chief, HM King Frederick IX of Denmark at Folkestone on 23 June. In 1964 the regiment was deployed to British Guiana after violence broke out there, at a time when the South American colony was experiencing turbulent times. The regiment departed South America for the Far East the following year, joining the Hong Kong garrison. In June 1966, the regiment was deployed on a six-month tour-of- duty in the jungles of Borneo to take part in the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation. This had started in 1962 after an Indonesian-inspired rebellion took place in Brunei, which was successfully quelled. The 'Confrontation' officially ended a short while after the regiment arrived; it returned to Hong Kong upon the end of its tour. The regiment existed for less than six years: on 31 December 1966, the four regiments of the Home Counties Brigade were merged to form the Queen's Regiment.

The corticobulbar tract is one of the pyramidal tracts, the other being the corticospinal tract. ==Structure== The corticobulbar tract originates in the primary motor cortex of the frontal lobe, just superior to the lateral fissure and rostral to the central sulcus in the precentral gyrus (Brodmann area 4). The tract descends through the corona radiata and genu of the internal capsule with a few fibers in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, as it passes from the cortex down to the midbrain. In the midbrain, the internal capsule becomes the cerebral peduncles. The white matter is located in the ventral portion of the cerebral peduncles, called the crus cerebri. The middle third of the crus cerebri contains the corticobulbar and corticospinal fibers. The corticobulbar fibers exit at the appropriate level of the brainstem to synapse on the lower motor neurons of the cranial nerves. In addition to endings in these motor neurons, fibers of the corticobulbar tract also end in the sensory nuclei of the brainstem including gracile nucleus, cuneate nucleus, solitary nucleus, and all trigeminal nuclei. Only 50% of the corticobulbar fibers decussate, in contrast to those of the corticospinal tract where most decussate. == Functions == The corticobulbar tract is composed of the upper motor neurons of the cranial nerves. The muscles of the face, head and neck are controlled by the corticobulbar system, which terminates on motor neurons within brainstem motor nuclei. This is in contrast to the corticospinal tract in which the cerebral cortex connects to spinal motor neurons, and thereby controls movement of the torso, upper and lower limbs. Fibers that end in the sensory nuclei of the brainstem are thought to enhance or inhibit sensory transmission across various sensory nuclei. This allows for the selective attention or inattention towards various stimuli. The corticobulbar tract innervates cranial motor nuclei bilaterally with the exception of the lower facial nuclei (which innervates facial muscles below the eyes) and the genioglossus muscle, which are innervated only unilaterally by the contralateral cortex. Among those nuclei that are bilaterally innervated a slightly stronger connection contralaterally than ipsilaterally is observed. The corticobulbar tract directly innervates the nuclei for cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and XII. The corticobulbar tract also contributes to the motor regions of cranial nerve X in the nucleus ambiguus. ==See also== * Upper motor neuron * Upper motor neuron lesion ==Referenceshttp://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/i/i_06/i_06_cl/i_06_cl_mou/i_06_cl_mou.html * http://pathology.mc.duke.edu/neuropath/nawr/motor-systems.html Category:Central nervous system pathways Category:Motor system Category:Frontal lobe ","title":"Corticobulbar tract"},{"id":"1426171","text":"(also simply known as Sonic Pocket Adventure) is a platform game developed and published by SNK and released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color in 1999. The game is based on Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992) for the Sega Genesis, borrowing much of the stage themes and gameplay elements, but featuring unique stage layouts, elements from other Genesis Sonic the Hedgehog games, and extra game modes. Sega's Yuji Naka and the rest of Sonic Team supervised over production. The game was released in December 1999 to positive reviews. Critics felt Sonic Pocket Adventure was a faithful adaptation of the traditional Sonic game formula, most importantly not making any sacrifices to the game's speed. Reviewers praised the game as one of the best among the Neo Geo Pocket Color's library and commended the quality of SNK's hardware. Several members of the SNK development team later formed Dimps which went on to develop several more Sonic games for handheld devices. ==Gameplay== Sonic in the game's first stage Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure is a platform game in the style of the classic Sonic the Hedgehog games for the Sega Genesis. The game is heavily based on Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992) for the Genesis, while also using concepts from Sonic the Hedgehog (1991) and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994). Sonic 2's stage themes are featured throughout, but the stage layouts are unique to the game. The bonus stages are also borrowed from Sonic 2. AllGame called the game \\"a slightly dumbed down port\\" of Sonic 2 and Official Dreamcast Magazine called it \\"essentially an adaptation of Sonic 2.\\" Unlike Sonic 2, Sonic Pocket Adventure features some exclusive modes. The game includes a save feature so the player can replay any level they have previously completed. There is also a time trial mode which ranks the player based on how quickly they finish each level. Another time trial mode requires the player to finish with 50 or more rings for the time to count. Sonic Pocket Adventure also supports two competitive two-player modes with the use of a Neo Geo Pocket link cable. One mode has the players racing each other to finish the stage first, while the other is a race to collect a target amount of rings. The second player controls Tails. There is also a puzzle mode where the player assembles portraits of Sonic characters using hidden puzzle pieces found within the levels. Completing the puzzles unlocks a sound test mode. ==Development and release== In August 1999, SNK announced that they were collaborating with Sega to develop a Sonic the Hedgehog game for their Neo Geo Pocket Color handheld system. The game was developed by SNK, with supervision from Yuji Naka and Sonic Team at Sega. This marked the first time Sega was directly involved in the development of a Sonic game for a non-Sega platform. The team planned for Sonic Pocket Adventure to be a return to the classic 2D gameplay style found in the Sonic games on the Sega Genesis. In particular, many game design and visual elements are borrowed from Sonic 2. The game's background music tracks are also 8-bit renditions of music from Sonic 3. Sonic Pocket Adventure was released first in North America on December 4, 1999. SNK released a system bundle with the game included for the holiday season. The game was released in Japan two weeks later, and in Europe in February 2000. Several of the SNK staff members who developed Sonic Pocket Adventure went on to form Dimps in 2000‚Äîa new team funded by Sega, Sony, and Bandai. The new company went on to develop Sonic Advance (2001) for the Game Boy Advance and several more Sonic games for handheld systems in the following years. ==Reception== Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure received critical acclaim. Critics generally believed that despite being on a handheld system, the game successfully captured the same high speed thrills and sharp graphics as in the original Genesis games. The most common complaints were occasional frame rate slowdown and the lack of parallax scrolling, but most agreed these problems were not intrusive enough to detract from the otherwise great quality of the game. Some critics highlighted how well the system's hardware performed in their reviews. Official Dreamcast Magazine praised the joystick on the handheld as controlling better than the Genesis controllers. Daily Radar thanked SNK for developing a good enough screen to prevent any unwanted motion blur. IGN believed the game was a killer app for the Neo Geo Pocket Color and filled the platform game role the system's library was so desperately missing. Official Dreamcast Magazine called it SNK's raison d'√™tre for the Neo Geo Pocket Color. AllGame disagreed that it was a killer app, but felt it showcased the system's processing prowess well. In retrospect, IGN called Sonic Pocket Adventure a system seller and a proving ground for the development team, as many members of the staff would go on to develop several more Sonic games for handheld systems as Dimps. IGN included Sonic Pocket Adventure on their wishlist of games for the Virtual Console on the Nintendo DSi. Although the Neo Geo Pocket Color was not commercially successful, Retro Gamer still called it a \\"fantastically playable\\" machine with Sonic Pocket Adventure being one of the best games in the system's library and the Sonic catalog. GamesRadar listed the game at number six among their list of top 25 Sonic games of all time. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * (English, archived) * (Japanese, archived) Category:1999 video games Category:Neo Geo Pocket Color games Category:Sega video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Sonic the Hedgehog video games Category:Cooperative video games Category:SNK games ","title":"Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure"},{"id":"1426181","text":"Harriet Brooks (July 2, 1876 ‚Äì April 17, 1933) was the first Canadian female nuclear physicist. She is most famous for her research on nuclear transmutations and radioactivity. Ernest Rutherford, who guided her graduate work, regarded her as being next to Marie Curie in the calibre of her aptitude. She was among the first persons to discover radon and to try to determine its atomic mass. ==Biography== === Early Years === Harriet Brooks was born in Exeter, Ontario, on July 2, 1876 to George and Elizabeth Warden Brooks. She was the third of nine children. Her father, George Brooks, worked at his own flour mill until it burned down and was not covered by insurance. He then supported the family by working as a commercial traveler for a flour firm. Brooks moved around Quebec and Ontario with her family during her childhood. At some point, she attended the Seaforth Collegiate Institute in Ontario. Her family finally settled in Montreal. === Education and Research === Of the nine Brooks children, only Harriet and her sister Elizabeth would attend university. Harriet Brooks entered McGill University in 1894, only six years after McGill graduated its first female student. Brooks won a scholarship for the final two years of her Bachelor's degree, but being a woman disqualified her from receiving a scholarship for her first two years. Brooks graduated with a first-class honours B.A. in mathematics and natural philosophy in 1898, and was awarded the Anne Molson Memorial prize for outstanding performance in mathematics. Brooks was the first graduate student in Canada of Sir Ernest Rutherford, under whom she worked immediately after graduating. With Rutherford, she studied electricity and magnetism for her master's degree. Even before her thesis was completed, her work was published in the Transactions of the Canadian Section of the Royal Society in 1899. The same year, Brooks received an appointment as nonresident tutor at the newly formed Royal Victoria College, the women's college of McGill University. In 1901, she became the first woman at McGill to receive a master's degree. After her master's degree under Rutherford, she also did a series of experiments to determine the nature of the radioactive emissions from thorium. These experiments served as one of the foundations for the development of nuclear science. Papers by Rutherford and Brooks in 1901 and 1902 were published in Royal Society Transactions and in the Philosophical Magazine. In 1901, Brooks obtained a fellowship to study for her doctorate of physics at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. During her year there, Brooks won the prestigious Bryn Mawr European Fellowship. Rutherford arranged for Brooks to take this fellowship at his former lab at the University of Cambridge, where she became the first woman to study at the Cavendish Laboratory. While Brooks completed significant work during her time at Cambridge, her supervisor, J.J. Thomson, was preoccupied with his own research and ignored her progress. In 1903, Brooks returned to her position at Royal Victoria College and rejoined Rutherford's group, carrying out research that was published in 1904. The following year, Brooks was appointed to the faculty of Barnard College in New York City. In 1906, she became engaged to a Columbia University physics professor. Dean Laura Gil of Barnard responded to Brooks' engagement by saying \\"that whenever your marriage does take place it ought to end your official relationship with the college\\". This began a heated exchange of letters in which Brooks conveyed that she felt she had a duty to both her profession and her sex to continue her work even after marriage. Brooks was backed by the head of Barnard's physics department, Margaret Maltby. However, Dean Gil cited the college's trustees, who argued that one could not be both a married woman and a successful academic. Brooks broke off her engagement and agreed to stay at Barnard. At the end of 1906, Brooks moved to a retreat in the Adirondacks run by John and Prestonia Martin, two prominent Fabian Socialists. Through the Martins, she also became acquainted with Russian author Maxim Gorky. In October 1906, Brooks travelled with Gorky and a group of other Russians to the Italian island of Capri. During this time, Brooks met Marie Curie, and shortly after started working as one of Curie's staff at the Institut du Radium in Paris, France. Though none of Brooks' research was published under her name during this period, her contributions were considered valuable and she was cited in three contemporary articles published under the aegis of the Curie Institute. During this time, Brooks worked to secure a position at the University of Manchester. In the letter of recommendation Rutherford wrote for Brooks' application, he noted that \\"next to Mme Curie she is the most prominent woman physicist in the department of radioactivity. Miss Brooks is an original and careful worker with good experimental powers and I am confident that if appointed she would do most excellent research work in Physics\\". However, Brooks decided to terminate her physics career for unknown reasons. === Personal life === In 1907, Harriet Brooks married McGill physics instructor Frank Pitcher and settled in Montreal. She became the mother of three children, two of whom tragically died in their teens. She remained active in organizations of university women, but no longer did any work in the field of physics. The obituary of Harriet Brooks was published by The New York Times on April 18, 1933, recording that she had died the previous day in Montreal at the age of 57, crediting her as the \\"Discoverer of the Recoil of a Radioactive Atom.\\" She died \\"of a ‚Äòblood disorder‚Äô,\\" probably leukaemia caused by radiation exposure. Rutherford wrote a highly laudatory obituary of Brooks in the journal Nature. == Legacy == The importance of Harriet Brooks' contributions to physics became recognized in the 1980s as foundational work in the field of nuclear science. She was the first person to show that the radioactive substance emitted from thorium was a gas with molecular weight of 40-100, a discovery crucial to the determination that the elements undergo some transmutation in radioactive decay. Her research of radon and actinium was pioneering, and her brief research career was exceedingly accomplished. The Harriet Brooks Building, a nuclear research laboratory at Canadian Nuclear Laboratories was named for her. She was inducted into the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame in 2002. ==References== ==Further reading== * * E. Rutherford and H. T. Brooks, \\"The New Gas from Radium,\\" Trans. R. Soc.

The term control freak was first used in the 1970s, a decade when the cultural Zeitgeist featured liberal social norms, which espoused the live-and-let-live principle of \\"Do your own thing\\" in opposition its perceived requirement of social conformity within traditional conservatism.Glaser, Kristin in The Radical Therapist (Penguin 1974) p. 246 == Personality psychology == In the study of personality psychology, people with certain personality disorders display characteristics involving their need to gain the compliance of and control over other people:Larsen, Randy J. and Buss, David M.

There may be a fine line between being a detail-oriented manager, who likes to have things done 'right', and being a (destructive) control freak.Gillian Tett, Fool's Gold (London 2009) p. 165 Control freaks are usually a cause of micromanagement. In some cases, the control freak sees their constant intervention as beneficial or even necessary. This can be caused by feelings of separation or departure from a loved one; or by the belief that others are incapable of handling matters properly, or the fear that things will go wrong if they do not attend to every detail. In other cases, they may simply enjoy the feeling of power it gives them so much that they automatically try to gain control of everything and everyone around them. ==In history== ===Wellington v.

Map of Moonee Ponds Creek The Moonee Ponds Creek is a creek and major tributary of the Yarra River running through urban Melbourne, Victoria, Australia from northern to inner suburbs. In 2004 a reporter for the Age newspaper described it as \\"arguably the most abused tributary of the Yarra River, and part of the true underside of Melbourne\\". It is rural in its upper sections near Greenvale, passing across basalt plains around Woodlands Historic Park,parkweb.vic.gov.au - Woodlands Historic Park just north of Melbourne Airport. Towards its mouth it is hemmed in by the Cenozoic caps of Essendon and Royal Park before joining the Yarra River. Through the heavily urbanised areas it flows through it is best characterised as a concrete stormwater drain. It winds its way through the suburbs of Westmeadows, Meadow Heights, Tullamarine, Broadmeadows, Gowanbrae, Glenroy, Strathmore Heights, Oak Park, Strathmore, Pascoe Vale, Pascoe Vale South, Essendon, Brunswick West, Moonee Ponds, Ascot Vale, Flemington, Parkville, North Melbourne (where its artificially widened section is named Railway Canal) before joining the Yarra River at Melbourne Docklands. ==History== Before European settlement, the Moonee Ponds Creek was the home of the Wurundjeri People of the Kulin nation. Though there are no written records it is probable that the creek takes its name from an indigenous inhabitant Moonee Moonee, who, along with Tullamareena, burnt down and escaped from the first Melbourne gaol in 1838. The Port Phillip area was first settled by Europeans in 1835. The first land sales in the area of Strathmore on Moonee Ponds Creek were made in 1843 and 1845. The creek formed a series of marshy ponds on the floodplain, with extensive salt water marshes near its entry to the Yarra river known as Batman's lagoon. With rapid development of Melbourne due to the Victorian gold rush in the 1850s, the swamp quickly became a receptacle for waste waters from Flemington, North Melbourne and Parkville. In 1879 Batman lagoon was drained and filled to make way for the North Melbourne railway yards at its northern end. At its southern area, the filled in marshes were called Dudley Flats, where impoverished people scrounged building material from the land-fill tip to build shelters and huts during the 1930s depression. In the 1890s the lower Moonee Ponds Creek was used as a canal for barges carrying coal to the North Melbourne Locomotive Depot. In 1950s and 1960s the Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works (now called Melbourne Water) realigned and concreted the creek from Strathmore to Flemington Road, in an attempt to stop periodic flooding. The modifications were part of extensive urban development of the lower floodplain. For much of its length through the northern suburbs it is now characterised as a concrete stormwater drain that parallels the Tullamarine Freeway. In 1998 the Moonee Ponds Creek Co-ordination Committee Inc (MPCCC) was founded to oversee planning, restoration, education, and development of guidelines and policies aimed at protecting and enhancing the Creek and its tributaries. The MPCCC members are each of the four councils (Hume, Moreland, Moonee Valley and Melbourne) and the Friends of Moonee Ponds Creek. MPCCC also has excellent working relationships with Melbourne Water, Parks Victoria, Department of Sustainability, Department of Primary Industries and Port Phillip and Westernport Catchment Management Authority. In 2002 the downstream end of the creek was realigned, to accommodate development of Victoria Dock at the Port of Melbourne. Moving the confluence with the Yarra River about 600 metres upstream, the creek mouth once located at the east end of Appleton Dock was removed, with a new watercourse dug leading directly south parallel with the Bolte Bridge approach spans. The realignment created a buffer zone between the port and the Melbourne Docklands residential and commercial areas. While realigning waterways is not a preferred option for Melbourne Water, the work was permitted as previous modifications had left the creek lacking a \\"true remaining 'natural' alignment\\" in the area. ==Conservation== Railway Canal near 37 Dynon Rd at North Melbourne. In recent years some improvement work has focused on enhancing habitat and stabilising, reshaping and replanting the banks of the creek. In 2005 the water quality, aquatic life and flow were all rated as poor; vegetation was rated as very poor; habitat and stability were rated as good. During 2004 a major stormwater improvement program was embarked upon in the creek's catchment area, and wetlands at Jacana and litter traps have been built. Recent habitat conservation work has resulted in some wildlife returning to the creek, including the pobblebonk frog around the Strathmore Secondary College, and nankeen night heron in the upper catchment. Along the entire length of the Moonee Ponds Creek, starting at Melbourne Docklands and continuing to Woodlands Homestead within Woodlands Historic Park, a shared pathway the Moonee Ponds Creek Trail provides a recreational path for cyclists and walkers, connecting many reserves, parks and sporting grounds along the creek.

Unsatisfied with this selection, Fukuda, who had climbed many mountains in Japan, selected 100 celebrated Japanese mountains based on a combination of grace, history, and individuality, moreover excluding mountains with an altitude of less than . Though it was at first unknown other than to some hiking-lovers and avid readers, reports that the list was one of the Prince's favorite books increased its profile. The Crown Prince is a mountain enthusiast to the extent that he has even belonged to an alpine club, and it has been reported that it is a dream of his to reach the summit of every mountain on the list. Since the 1980s, there has been a climbing boom amongst the middle-aged. It is not alpinism for experts, sometimes including rock climbing, that has been popularised, but rather more casual hiking or trekking for ordinary people. However, due to the creation of more mountain lodges and trails, and the improvement of mountaineering technology, it became possible to climb mountains which had previously been considered very rugged. The list became widely read, and people who choose mountains from the book to climb have increased. In imitation of Prince Naruhito, many people have also set the goal of reaching every summit on the list. Mountaineering programs on NHK helped popularize the list. The station televised a documentary about taking up the mountains on the list one by one, and Ramb≈ç Minami's mountaineering primer for the middle-aged. These gained wide popularity, and the list became widely known. Since then, lists of 200 and 300 mountains, lists of hundreds of mountains in various localities, and a list of 100 floral mountains have appeared. In 2002, a new record traversing all of the mountains in 66 days was established. This was superseded in 2007, with a new record of 48 continuous days.ÁôæÂêçÂ±±„ÄÅÊúÄÁü≠48Êó•„ÅßË∏èÁ†¥ Â±ã‰πÖ„ÅÆÂ≥∂Ê¥•„Åï„Çì This was further cut to 33 days in 2014 English translation by Martin Hood is published as One Hundred Mountains of Japan (University of Hawaii Press 2014Ôºâ. ==Assessment== Compared to other modern essays on Japanese mountains such as Mountaineering and Exploration in the Japanese Alps by Walter Weston, the book is short. Fukuda writes about the history of the mountains, especially the origins of their names. It is not a text that people can read to vicariously experience climbing or nature. Some think that the reason the list has been widely well received is that it put into focus 100 mountains which were already well known. ==Selection criteria== Fukada selected 100 mountains from those which are 1,500 meter or higher and he had climbed up ever, according to three criteria: grace, history and individuality. He softened the altitude limit on some exceptions, like Mount Tsukuba and Mount Kaimon. There have been many varying opinions about the criteria for selection. It is often pointed out that the list emphasises mountains in the Ch≈´bu region. It has been reported that Fukada, who was from Ishikawa Prefecture, was brought up looking at Mt. Haku, but he only selected 13 further west. However, grace and individuality are in the eye of the beholder, and throughout history, many legends have been circulated about mountains throughout the Kinki region. Moreover, many mountain-lovers have argued that since Mount Tsukuba, with an altitude of 877 meters (876 at the time), was selected, certain mountains in other localities should have been selected. ==List by region== ===Hokkaid≈ç=== Mount Daisetsu - 2,191m *Akan Volcanic Complex (ÈòøÂØíÂ≤≥) *Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group (Â§ßÈõ™Â±±) *Mount Poroshiri (ÂπåÂ∞ªÂ≤≥) *Mount Rausu (ÁæÖËáºÂ≤≥) *Mount Rishiri (Âà©Â∞ªÂ≤≥) *Mount Shari (ÊñúÈáåÂ≤≥) *Mount Tokachi (ÂçÅÂãùÂ≤≥) *Mount Tomuraushi („Éà„É†„É©„Ç¶„Ç∑Â±±) *Mount Y≈çtei (ÁæäËπÑÂ±±) ===T≈çhoku region=== *Mount Adatara (ÂÆâÈÅîÂ§™ËâØÂ±±) *Mount Aizu-Komagatake (‰ºöÊ¥•Èßí„É∂Â≤≥) *Mount Asahi (ÊúùÊó•Â≤≥) Hakk≈çda - 1,584m *Mount Azuma (ÂêæÂ¶ªÂ±±) *Mount Bandai (Á£êÊ¢ØÂ±±) *Mount Ch≈çkai (È≥•Êµ∑Â±±) *Mount Gassan (ÊúàÂ±±) *Mount Hachimantai (ÂÖ´Âπ°Âπ≥) *Hakk≈çda (ÂÖ´Áî≤Áî∞Â±±) *Mount Hayachine (Êó©Ê±†Â≥∞Â±±) *Mount Hiuchigatake (Ááß„É∂Â≤≥) *Mount Iide (È£ØË±äÂ±±) *Mount Iwaki (Â≤©Êú®Â±±) *Mount Iwate (Â≤©ÊâãÂ±±) *Mount Za≈ç (ËîµÁéãÂ±±) ===Kant≈ç region=== Mount Nantai - 2,486m *Mount Akagi (Ëµ§ÂüéÂ±±) *Mount Asama (ÊµÖÈñìÂ±±) *Mount Azumaya (ÂõõÈòøÂ±±) *Mount Hiragatake (Âπ≥„É∂Â≤≥) *Mount Hotaka (Ê≠¶Â∞äÂ±±) *Mount Kumotori (Èõ≤ÂèñÂ±±) *Mount Kusatsu- Shirane (ËçâÊ¥•ÁôΩÊ†πÂ±±) *Mount Nantai (Áî∑‰ΩìÂ±±) *Mount Nasu (ÈÇ£È†àÂ≤≥) *Mount Nikk≈ç-Shirane (Êó•ÂÖâÁôΩÊ†πÂ±±) *Mount Ry≈çkami (‰∏°Á•ûÂ±±) *Mount Shibutsu (Ëá≥‰ªèÂ±±) *Mount Sukai (ÁöáÊµ∑Â±±) *Mount Tanigawa (Ë∞∑Â∑ùÂ≤≥) *Mount Tanzawa (‰∏πÊ≤¢Â±±) *Mount Tsukuba (Á≠ëÊ≥¢Â±±) ===Ch≈´bu region=== Mount Aino - 3,189m *Mount Aino (Èñì„ÉéÂ≤≥) *Mount Akaishi (Ëµ§Áü≥Â≤≥) *Mount Amagi (Â§©ÂüéÂ±±) *Mount Amakazari (Èõ®È£æÂ±±) *Mount Daibosatsu (Â§ßËè©Ëñ©Â≤≥) *Mount Ena (ÊÅµÈÇ£Â±±) *Mount Fuji (ÂØåÂ£´Â±±) *Mount Gory≈´ (‰∫îÁ´úÂ≤≥) *Mount Haku (ÁôΩÂ±±) *Mount Hijiri (ËÅñÂ≤≥) *Mount Hiuchi (ÁÅ´ÊâìÂ±±) *Mount H≈ç≈ç (È≥≥Âá∞Â±±) Mount Hotaka - 3,190m *Mount Hotaka (Á©ÇÈ´òÂ≤≥) *Mount J≈çnen (Â∏∏ÂøµÂ≤≥) *Mount Kaikoma (Áî≤ÊñêÈßí„É∂Â≤≥) *Mount Kasa (Á¨†„É∂Â≤≥) *Mount Kashima Yarigatake (ÈπøÂ≥∂Êßç„É∂Â≤≥) *Mount Kinpu (ÈáëÂ≥∞Â±±) *Mount Kirigamine (Èúß„É∂Â≥∞) *Mount Kisokoma (Êú®ÊõæÈßí„É∂Â≤≥) *Mount Kita (ÂåóÂ≤≥) *Mount Kobushi (Áî≤Ê≠¶‰ø°„É∂Â≤≥) *Mount Kuro (ÈªíÂ≤≥) *Mount Kurobegor≈ç (ÈªíÈÉ®‰∫îÈÉéÂ≤≥) *Mount Makihata (Â∑ªÊ©üÂ±±) *Mount Mizugaki (ÁëûÁâÜÂ±±) *Mount My≈çk≈ç (Â¶ôÈ´òÂ±±) *Mount Naeba (ËãóÂ†¥Â±±) *Mount Norikura (‰πóÈûçÂ≤≥) *Mount Ontake (Âæ°Â∂ΩÂ±±) *Mount Senj≈ç (‰ªô‰∏à„É∂Â≤≥) *Mount Shiomi (Â°©Ë¶ãÂ≤≥) Mount Shirouma - 2,932m *Mount Shirouma (ÁôΩÈ¶¨Â≤≥) *Mount Takatsuma (È´òÂ¶ªÂ±±) *Mount Tateshina (ËìºÁßëÂ±±) *Mount Tate (Á´ãÂ±±) *Mount Tekari (ÂÖâÂ≤≥) *Mount Tsurugi (Ââ£Â≤≥) *Mount Uonuma-Komagatake (È≠öÊ≤ºÈßí„É∂Â≤≥) *Mount Utsugi (Á©∫Êú®Â≤≥) *Mount Warusawa (ÊÇ™Ê≤¢Â≤≥) *Mount Washiba (È∑≤ÁæΩÂ≤≥) *Mount Yake (ÁÑºÂ≤≥) *Mount Yakushi (Ëñ¨Â∏´Â≤≥) *Mount Yari (Êßç„É∂Â≤≥) *Yatsugatake (ÂÖ´„É∂Â≤≥) *Utsukushigahara Highland (Áæé„É∂Âéü) ===Western Japan=== Mount Ibuki and N700 Series Shinkansen - 1,377m *Mount Arashima (ËçíÂ≥∂Â≤≥) *Mount Aso (ÈòøËòáÂ±±) *Daisen (Â§ßÂ±±) *Mount Ibuki (‰ºäÂêπÂ±±) *Mount Ishizuchi (Áü≥ÈéöÂ±±) *Mount Kaimon (ÈñãËÅûÂ≤≥) *Mount Kirishima (ÈúßÂ≥∂Â±±) *Mount Kuj≈´ (‰πùÈáçÂ±±) or Kokonoe *Mount Miyanoura (ÂÆÆ‰πãÊµ¶Â≤≥) *Mount ≈ådaigahara (Â§ßÂè∞„É∂ÂéüÂ±±) *Mount ≈åmine (Â§ßÂ≥∞Â±±) *Mount Sobo (Á•ñÊØçÂ±±) *Mount Tsurugi (Ââ£Â±±) ==Notes== ==See also== *Ky≈´ya Fukada *List of mountains in Japan ==External links== One Hundred Mountains of Japan Japan, 100 famous Mountains Category:Works about mountaineering Category:Japanese non-fiction literature ","title":"100 Famous Japanese Mountains"},{"id":"1426211","text":"Luitpold Karl Joseph Wilhelm Ludwig, Prince Regent of Bavaria (12 March 1821 ‚Äì 12 December 1912), was the de facto ruler of Bavaria from 1886 to 1912, due to the incapacity of his nephews, King Ludwig II for three days and King Otto for 26 years. ==Early life== Prince Luitpold of Bavaria Luitpold was born in W√ºrzburg, the third son of King Ludwig I of Bavaria and his wife, Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. He was the younger brother of King Maximilian II of Bavaria and of King Otto of Greece. Luitpold was in line to succeed to the throne of the Kingdom of Bavaria, and was also heir presumptive to the throne of Greece, since his brother Otto had no children. However, the Greek constitution required that Otto's heir should belong to the Greek Orthodox Church. Otto was deposed in 1862 and replaced by Prince William of Denmark, who became George I, King of the Hellenes. Otto died in 1867, leaving Luitpold and his descendants as representatives of Otto's claim. However, Luitpold never pursued that claim. At the age of fourteen, Luitpold joined the Bavarian Army and was promoted to Captain of the Artillery in 1835. During the revolutions of 1848, Prince Luitpold mediated and facilitated an audience of discontented citizens with his father. During the rule of his brother Maximilian II (1848‚Äì64), Luitpold did not play a significant political role. With the reign of his nephew Ludwig II (1864‚Äì1886), Prince Luitpold had increasingly to represent the royal house due to the king's long absence from the capital. In the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 Luitpold was commander of the 3rd Royal Bavarian Division. In 1869, he became Inspector General of the Bavarian Army, during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 and 1871, he represented Bavaria in the German General Staff. In that capacity, he handed over Ludwig's Kaiserbrief on 3 December 1870, in which Ludwig endorsed the creation of the German Empire with the King of Prussia as Emperor. Since Ludwig, who nonetheless regretted Bavaria's loss of independence, refused to attend Wilhelm's 10 January proclamation as Emperor in the Palace of Versailles,Nohbauer, 1998, p. 37. Ludwig's brother, Prince Otto, and his uncle Luitpold represented him in the Palace of Versailles.Dr. Theodor Toeche- Mittler: Die Kaiserproklamation in Versailles am 18. Januar 1871 mit einem Verzeichni√ü der Festtheilnehmer, Ernst Siegfried Mittler und Sohn, Berlin, 1896H. Schnaebeli: Fotoaufnahmen der Kaiserproklamation in Versailles, Berlin, 1871 Otto then criticized the celebration as ostentatious and heartless in a letter to his brother. In 1876, Luitpold was appointed Field Marshal. ==Regency== Prince Regent Luitpold celebrating his 90th birthday in 1911 On 10 June 1886, Luitpold's nephew King Ludwig II was declared mentally incompetent and Luitpold was named Regent. Luitpold's part is still controversial. Following Ludwig II's mysterious death a few days later, his brother Otto assumed the throne. However, Otto was likewise (or more so) mentally incapable of reigning; he had been under medical supervision since 1883. Accordingly, Luitpold continued to serve as regent. Prince Luitpold was even accused by some people of the murder of his nephew, but soon the decent and affable prince became one of Bavaria's most popular rulers. One of his first actions (on 1 August 1886) was to open several of the palaces of Ludwig II to the public. Politically, Luitpold remained largely passive. His governments gradually moved away from the previous anti-Catholic Kulturkampf policies. This development culminated in 1912 when the appointment of the Centre Party politician Georg von Hertling as minister president; this also effectively brought about a parliamentarisation of the government, as Hertling's Centre Party was the largest group in the Landtag. During the regency of Prince- Regent Luitpold, relations between Bavarians and Prussians remained cold as Bavarians resented Prussia's strategic dominance over the empire. Luitpold continued to serve as regent until 1912, when he contracted bronchitis and died in Munich. He is buried in the crypt of the Theatinerkirche in Munich. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Prince Ludwig, who remained as regent for another year. In 1913, the constitution was amended to add a clause stating that if a regency for reasons of incapacity had lasted for at least 10 years with no prospect of the king being able to actively reign, the regent could assume the throne in his own right. Soon after this amendment was promulgated, Ludwig deposed Otto and assumed the throne as Ludwig III. The Prinzregentenzeit (\\"prince's regent's time\\"), as the regency of Luitpold is often called, was due to the political passiveness of Luitpold during an era of the gradual transfer of Bavarian interests behind those of the German empire. In connection with the unhappy end of the preceding rule of King Ludwig II, this break in the Bavarian monarchy looked even stronger. Finally, the constitutional amendment of 1913 brought the determining break in the continuity of the king's rule in the opinion of historians, particularly as this change had been granted by the Landtag as a House of Representatives and meant therefore indirectly the first step toward parliamentary rule in Bavaria. Today the connection of these two developments is regarded as a main cause for the unspectacular end of the Bavarian kingdom without opposition in the course of the November revolution of 1918. However the course of his 26-year regency Luitpold grew to overcome, by modesty, ability and popularity, the initial uneasiness of his subjects. These prince's regent's years were transfigured, finally ‚Äì above all in the retrospect ‚Äì to a golden age of Bavaria, even if one mourned the \\"fairy tale king\\" Ludwig II furthermore what happens in a folkloric-nostalgic manner till this day. ==Legacy== Augsburg monument by the sculptor Franz Bernauer on top of the fountain Prinzregentenbrunnen. Angel of Peace in the Prinzregentenstrasse in Munich, erected as antipole to the Berlin Victory Column Tutored as a child by Domenico Quaglio the Younger, Luitpold had a great feeling for the arts. Luitpold's years as regent were marked by tremendous artistic and cultural activity in Bavaria where they are known as the Prinzregentenjahre (\\"The Prince Regent Years\\") or the Prinzregentenzeit. Bavaria prospered under a liberal government and Munich became a cultural centre of Europe. Thomas Mann wrote about this period \\"Munich shone\\" (1902 Gladius Dei). Schwabing became an important artists' quarter in Munich. There are numerous streets in Bavarian cities and towns called Prinzregentenstrasse or Luitpoldstrasse. Many institutions are named in Luitpold's honour including the Prinzregententheater in Munich and the Luitpoldarena and the Luitpoldhalle in N√ºrnberg. In 1891 Luitpold established the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich. Prinzregententorte is a multi-layered cake with chocolate butter cream named in his honour. The vessel SMS Prinzregent Luitpold of the Imperial German Navy and the Luitpold Coast were named for Luitpold. Luitpold's great passion next to the arts was hunting, and his legendary hunts took place throughout Bavaria. ==Family== Ludwig, his grandson Rupprecht and his great-grandson Luitpold in the park of Nymphenburg Palace On 1 April 1844, in Florence, Luitpold married Archduchess Auguste Ferdinande of Austria, Princess of Tuscany, second daughter of Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Luitpold and Auguste had four children: *Ludwig III, King of Bavaria (1845‚Äì1921). Married Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este; had issue. *Prince Leopold Maximilian Joseph Maria Arnulf of Bavaria (1846‚Äì1930). Married Archduchess Gisela of Austria; had issue. *Princess Therese Charlotte Marianne Auguste of Bavaria (1850‚Äì1925) *Prince Franz Joseph Arnulf Adalbert Maria of Bavaria (1852‚Äì1907).

Cable Network Profiles. PGMedia.tv. Archived from the original on 28 July 2013. Retrieved 4 October 2014. The network served over 170 LPTV, Class A, full-power, cable and satellite affiliate stations. It was one of the first TV stations to have online live video streaming, before the tech bubble burst in 2000. At least twenty of the stations carried America One's complete 168-hour weekly transmission. In 2003, the network went through a restructuring, being placed within USFR Media Group's VOTH Network, Inc. subsidiary. In 2009, the network came under the ownership of America One Television Network, Inc. as a result of a shareholder buyout from USFR Media Group. In 2010, America One Television Network merged with B2 Broadcasting to create the holding company One Media Corp, Inc., which America One & B2 Broadcasting then became subsidiaries of, while retaining their respective brand identities. According to its press release in 2013, it broadcast \\"5500 live and exclusive events, over 100 U.S. Colleges, 70 professional sports teams and hundreds of top professional leagues from Asia and Europe.\\" It was reported in September 2014 that One Media Corp had sold America One to Center Post Networks, LLC, owner of Youtoo TV. The sale was finalized sometime in spring 2015, with Center Post Networks merging the two networks, resulting in both networks being replaced by Youtoo America. The sports assets were not included in the merger, as those had been spun off to One World Sports, then to Eleven Sports Network in 2017. ==Programming== America One aired a mix of entertainment and US & international sports programming in prime time. Cooking, travel and news shows and classic movies made up the network's daytime programming. The network also encouraged preemption of four hours per day of its programming for local sports, entertainment or news. ==America One Sports== America One held the U.S. broadcast rights to the Ontario Hockey League, Australian Football League, the USAR Hooters Pro Cup, the ECHL, playoffs in the Indoor Football League, and the American Hockey League's all star game. America One syndicated many of these broadcasts to various regional sports networks in the US (usually, those not part of the Fox Sports Net family). America One also carried tape-delayed broadcasts of the English Premier League, specifically Bolton Wanderers and Everton. America One also showed Midwest-based Victory Fighting M.M.A. Usually, those events were on tape delay. In 1999, America One broadcast NWA Wildside pro wrestling. America One had broadcast rights to several rugby league organizations. From 2010 the predominantly Britain-based Super League matches were shown live (rights to that league have since transitioned to Fox Sports 2 (then called Fuel TV) in 2013) in addition to Australasia's National Rugby League games. They also showed the American National Rugby League Grand final. Historically, America One had a longstanding partnership with the Canadian Football League that lasted through much of the 2000s; this ended prior to the 2010 season, with NFL Network taking over U.S. broadcast rights; as of 2014, ESPN holds those rights. In 2012, America One became the first American network to broadcast a Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) game (Hiroshima Toyo Carp home game) on tape delay. ==Affiliates== Affiliates received four minutes per hour for ads and end breaks while having to secure cable carriage themselves.

He was born in Nizhny Novgorod in the family of a trader. From childhood, Kulibin displayed an interest in constructing mechanical tools. Soon, clock mechanisms became a special interest of his. His realizations as well as his prolific imagination inspired the work of many. ==Saint Petersburg years== The famous project of Kulibin's one-arch bridge over the Neva. During 1764‚Äì1767 he built an egg-shaped clock, containing a complex automatic mechanism. In 1769 Kulibin gave this clock to Catherine II, who assigned Kulibin to be in charge of the mechanical workshop in the Academy of Sciences of Saint Petersburg (established in 1724). There, Kulibin built a ‚Äúplanetary‚Äù pocket-clock, which showed not only the current time, but also the month, day of the week, the season and the current moon phase. Kulibin also designed projects for tower clocks, miniature \\"clock-in-a-ring\\" types and others. He also worked on new ways to facet glass for use in microscopes, telescopes and other optical instruments. During the 1770s, he designed a wooden one-arch bridge over the Neva river with a span of 298 metres (instead of the typically used 50‚Äì60 metre spans), offering to use an original girder with a cross grate. In 1776 a model 1/10 the natural size of this bridge was tested by a special commission of academics. Kulibin's project was praised by Leonhard Euler and Daniel Bernoulli, but was never realized. After 1780, Kulibin worked on possibilities for a metallic bridge, but these projects were also rejected by the government. Altogether Kulibin designed three projects for wooden and three projects for metallic bridges. In 1779, he built a lantern that could emit a powerful light using a weak light source. This invention was used industrially for lighting workshops, lighthouses, ships, etc. In 1791, Kulibin constructed a push-cycle cart, in which he used a flywheel, a brake, a gearbox and roller bearing. The cart was operated by a man pressing pedals.http://www.aboutmycar.com/category/car_history/creation_history/automobile- invention-1122.htm–¢—Ä–µ—Ö–∫–æ–ª–µ—Å–Ω–æ–µ —á—É–¥–æ –º–µ—Ö–∞–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –ö—É–ª–∏–±–∏–Ω–∞ (in Russian)–°–∞–º–æ–∫–∞—Ç–∫–∞ –ö—É–ª–∏–±–∏–Ω–∞ (in Russian)–í–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∏ \\"–¢—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–æ—Ä—ã –∏ –∞–≤—Ç–æ–º–æ–±–∏–ª–∏\\" (in Russian)–û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω—ã–µ —Å–æ–±—ã—Ç–∏—è. –ò–∑–æ–±—Ä–µ—Ç–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –∞–≤—Ç–æ–º–æ–±–∏–ª—è (in Russian) In the same year, he also designed \\"mechanical legs\\", a prosthetic device, which was later used by a French entrepreneur. In 1793, Kulibin constructed an elevator that lifted a cabin using screw mechanisms. In 1794, he created an optical telegraph for transmitting signals over distance. ==Later years== Soviet postage stamp. In 1801 Kulibin was fired from the academy and returned to Nizhny Novgorod, where he designed a method of sailing upstream and built a ship which he had started to design back in 1782. Tests indicated that such ships were indeed feasible, but they were never used. During the same time, Kulibin had projects on using steam engines to move cargo ships, on creating salt mining machines, different kinds of mills, pianos and other projects. Kulibin died in 1818 after spending his last years in poverty. The International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center has named an asteroid in Kulibin's honor: 5809 Kulibin. The asteroid was discovered on September 4, 1987 by L. V. Zhuravleva at Nauchnyj.Schmadel, Lutz D. (2003‚Äì2005) Dictionary of Minor Planet Names: Addendum to Fifth Edition, Page 489.

He came of an old Anglo-Irish family settled in Ireland since the days of Sir Faithful Fortescue (1581‚Äì1666), whose uncle, The 1st Baron Chichester, was Lord Deputy. The history of the family was written by his elder brother, Thomas Fortescue, who in 1852 was created Baron Clermont. His mother was Martha Angel, daughter of Samuel Meade Hobson. Carlingford was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, where he took a first in Classics (1844) and won the chancellor's English essay (1846). In 1863, he assumed by Royal Licence the additional surname of Parkinson as heir to his aunt's husband William Parkinson Ruxton. ==Political career== In 1847, Carlingford was elected to parliament for Louth as a Liberal. He became a junior Lord of the Treasury in 1854 under Lord Palmerston, a post he held until 1855, and was later Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies under Palmerston between 1857 and 1858 and 1859 and 1865. He was admitted to the Privy Council in 1864 and the following year he was made Chief Secretary for Ireland under Lord Russell, a post which he again occupied under William Ewart Gladstone from 1868 to 1871 (this time with a seat in the cabinet). In 1866, he was also admitted to the Irish Privy Council. He was then President of the Board of Trade between 1871 and 1874. The latter year he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Carlingford, of Carlingford in the County of Louth. Carlingford later served under Gladstone as Lord Privy Seal between 1881 and 1885 and as Lord President of the Council between 1883 and 1885. In 1882, he was appointed a Knight of the Order of St Patrick. He parted from Gladstone on the question of Irish Home Rule, but in earlier years he was his active supporter on Irish questions. ==Personal life== Ape in Vanity Fair, 1869 Lord Carlingford married Frances Elizabeth Anne, Countess Waldegrave, daughter of John Braham, in 1863. She had been married three times before, the second time to The 7th Earl Waldegrave. There were no children from the marriage. Carlingford's influence in society was due largely to her. She died in July 1879, aged 58. In 1887, Carlingford's brother, Lord Clermont, died, and Carlingford inherited his peerage according to a special remainder, after which he was known as Lord Carlingford and Clermont.Historical Register of the University of Oxford: With an Alphabetical Record of University Honours and Distinctions Conferred to the End of Trinity Term, 1888 (Clarendon Press, 1888), p. 142 He died at Marseille, France, in January 1898, aged 75.

After the American Civil War, for a period of about 100 years, portions of Norfolk County were lost and the territory of the county reduced as they were annexed by the independent and growing cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth and South Norfolk. In 1963, voters approved by referendum in two jurisdictions to consolidate the remaining portions of Norfolk County with the much smaller city of South Norfolk; they chose the name city of Chesapeake for the new independent city. Although organized as a city, and one of the larger in Virginia, Chesapeake has both busy suburban and industrial areas, and mostly rural sections. The latter includes a large portion of the Great Dismal Swamp and large tracts of preserved forest land. == Shires to counties 1634-1691 == During the 17th century, shortly after establishment of the Jamestown Settlement in 1607, English settlers explored and began settling the areas adjacent to what is known as Hampton Roads. By 1634, the English colony of Virginia consisted of eight shires or counties with a total population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. One of these was Elizabeth City Shire, which included an area on both sides of Hampton Roads. The northern portion became Elizabeth City County in 1643. It is now incorporated into the city limits of Hampton. In 1636 the southern portion of Elizabeth City Shire became New Norfolk County by order of King Charles I of England. This area was divided again in 1637 into Upper and Lower Norfolk counties. == 1691 Norfolk County created: Adam Thoroughgood == old Norfolk County, Virginia Court House date unknown, image from collection, U.S. Library of Congress In 1691 Lower Norfolk County was in turn divided in two to form Norfolk and Princess Anne counties to accommodate settlement. Captain Adam Thoroughgood (1604‚Äì1640) is credited with naming Norfolk County. Thoroughgood was a prominent resident of the colony. Like so many others at that time, he had been born in England and immigrated to Virginia. He named the new county after his original \\"home\\" county across the Atlantic Ocean. After 1691, Norfolk County remained more or less intact for over 200 years. Portsmouth became the county seat and a major area of commerce, along with Norfolk. Smaller towns were formed at Berkley and South Norfolk. In 1871, Portsmouth and Norfolk became independent cities, a jurisdiction in Virginia, and separated from Norfolk County, though Portsmouth remained the county seat. South Norfolk became an independent city in 1919. In the following years, the county lost additional territory. The incorporated town of Berkley as well as the areas of Sewell's Point, Willoughby Spit, and Ocean View were annexed successively by Norfolk. By 1960, the entire area of Norfolk County on the east side of the Elizabeth River north of Virginia Beach Boulevard had been annexed by other jurisdictions. On other sides, West Norfolk (Churchland) was lost to Portsmouth, and South Norfolk had also annexed a portion of the county. == 1963: Creating a new city, Chesapeake == { class=\\" floatright\\" + Presidential Elections Resultshttp://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS - bgcolor=lightgrey !

In the early 1960s, the most recent attempt by the City of Norfolk to annex another portion of Norfolk County threatened to completely surround the tiny City of South Norfolk. That failed annexation would have threatened South Norfolk's viability as an independent entity. Since Norfolk County residents also feared future annexation suits, in this battle of municipalities, the residents of Norfolk County and the city of South Norfolk became allies. A strategy successfully used about 10 years earlier by Elizabeth City County, the Town of Phoebus, and the City of Hampton offered a solution. In 1963, after a referendum of South Norfolk and of Norfolk County's voters, and the approval of the Virginia General Assembly, South Norfolk and almost all of remaining Norfolk County consolidated and reorganized as the new City of Chesapeake, with the name chosen by the voters. ==See also== *Elizabeth City Shire *New Norfolk County *Lower Norfolk County *Berkley *City of Norfolk *Sewell's Point *Willoughby Spit *Ocean View *Bower's Hill *Lambert's Point *Deep Creek *Western Branch *Great Bridge *Portsmouth Courthouse ==References== == External links == *City of Chesapeake * Category:Former counties of Virginia Category:History of Norfolk, Virginia Category:Geography of Chesapeake, Virginia ","title":"Norfolk County, Virginia"},{"id":"1426271","text":"Henry Augustus Lukeman (January 28, 1872 ‚Äì April 3, 1935) was an American sculptor, specializing in historical monuments.

He is \\"said to have begun lessons at the National Academy and the Cooper Union School at age eleven,\\" though a National Academy of Design source notes that that school's \\"registration records do not bear‚Ä¶ out\\" this historical supposition. It is also reported that he began sculpting at age 10 at a boys' club miniature workshop, working in clay and wood from ages 10 to 13. At a young age he became a studio assistant of Launt Thompson, an Irish-American sculptor and National Academician,Anon., (1911). \\"Thompson, Launt (1833-1994),\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (11th ed., Chisholm, Hugh, ed.), Vol. 27, p. 870, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, see , accessed 12 September 2015. and, like Launt, pursued medically related studies (anatomy)‚ÄîLukeman at New York's Bellevue Hospital (for two year prior to 1890). He remained with Launt until age 16.National Sculpture Society (1929), ‚Äò‚ÄôContemporary American Sculpture: The California Palace of the Legion of Honor, Lincoln Park, San Francisco, April to October MCMXXIX\\" [catalog], p. 152, New York, NY: Kalkhoff Co.

There is report, potentially conflicting with other sources regarding his early training, that has him involved in an apprenticeship at the foundry of Jno. Williams, Inc. until he was 19. Likewise regarding a further report: that Lukeman studied terra cotta and architectural modeling for building and exterior decorations for several years, while in the evening studying life drawing (at the Cooper Union in New York). Lukeman is known to have attended classes at the National Academy for Design beginning in 1890, where records exist for his registration for the antique school (for two years), and to have followed this with study at Columbia University. Following that he went to Europe for 6 months and worked under Jean-Alexandre-Joseph Falguiere, at the Beaux Arts, in Paris.National Sculpture Society (1929), ‚Äò‚ÄôContemporary American Sculpture,‚Äô‚Äô p. 213, National Sculpture Society: New York, NY. When Lukeman returned to New York, he became an assistant to Daniel Chester French, a commitment that would last for a decade and a half, during which time he would also begin to execute his own commissions, eventually opening his own studio in New York. When construction of the World's Columbian Exposition began in 1893, Lukeman would superintend enlarging some important works for French, for instance, the Statue of the Republic. ===American works === Hebrew Psalmist, on the facade of the Brooklyn Museum, New York. Lukeman's independent work began in this new studio, and included the monuments in which he would come to specialize, as well as \\"portrait busts and statues, bas- reliefs, ornamental sculpture,\\" which have been described as being \\"architecturally effective and often remarkable in conception.\\" Notable works in New York state from his early independent work include figures for the Customs Building in Columbus, on the Appellate Court House in Manhattan, and on the facade of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences.Anon. (1910), \\"The Museum Statues,\\" in The Museum News, Vol. 6, no. 3 (December), pp. 34-36, Brooklyn, NY: Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, see , accessed 12 September 2015. A further more complete list of his American and Canadian commissions and other important public sculpture works is given below. A seminal work of Lukeman‚Äîproceeding from his earlier work on \\"several grandiose memorials\\"‚Äîwas to complete the execution of the enormously scaled Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial. This mountain carving depicted the confederacy's president, Jefferson Davis, and Generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson (and their respective horses Blackjack, Traveller, and Little Sorrel), in DeKalb County, Georgia, near Atlanta; there, Lukeman designed and supervised sculpting of the monument after removing the earlier work of Gutzon Borglum (the original commissionee, who had resigned). David Dearinger notes that \\"Lukeman was criticized for taking over another artist's work,\\" and that \\"he used Borglum's existing scheme,\\" though altering it to be a bas-relief whose figures would ultimately be over 150 feet tall. When funding ran out in the advent of the Great Depression, Lukeman would continue to pay the craftsmen until his own means were exhausted, after which the carving would remain incomplete for decades (until Walker Hancock and Roy Faulkner completed an edited version of the Lukeman design in 1970). Located 400 feet (120 m) above ground, and lacking the originally intended legs on the horses, the Lukeman-Hancock-Faulkner sculpture ultimately measured 190 feet (58 m) by 90 feet (27 m), and is recessed 42 feet (13 m). Lukeman died in New York on April 3, 1935, aged 65, leaving his wife, formerly, Helen Bidwell Blodgett. === Honors and awards === Lukeman's work was recognized by the Henry Street Settlement, and he was given an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Dickinson College. ==Influences, and those influenced== Two significant influences were those whose training he extensively received, Launt Thompson and Daniel Chester French. In addition, Lukeman was known to have kept a small nude study executed by Kenyon Cox, one which \\"Cox considered among his best,\\" and is therefore considered as one of Lukeman's possible artistic influences. ==Public sculptures== ===Dated entries=== The following entries, whose dates of execution are known, are ordered according to date, earliest to latest: * Manu, the Law Giver of India, 1899, on the Appellate Division Courthouse of New York State, New York City. * Music (Festival Hall) and another decorative sculpture (Electrical Building), at the Saint Louis Exposition, 1904, Saint Louis, Missouri; awarded a medal. * The Hebrew Law Giver, Psalmist, Apostle, and Prophet (4 figures, facade), 1907-1909, the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, New York. * The Straus Memorial in Straus Park, Manhattan, New York City, 1915; dedicated to Ida and Isidor Straus, who lost their lives on the RMS Titanic. * Pulitzer Prize gold medal (with Daniel Chester French), 1918.The Pulitzer Prize Board (2015). \\"The Medal: Pulitzer Gold,\\" see , accessed 12 September 2015. * The Prospect Park Memorial, 1921, a World War I monument, in Prospect Park, Brooklyn.NYC Parks (2015), \\"Prospect Park: Prospect Park War Memorial,\\" see , accessed 12 September 2015. * The Soldiers and Sailors Monument, 1923, Pittsfield, Massachusetts;https://www.massmilitarymonuments.com/Pittsfield-Mass.php refurbished, with presentation, Memorial Day 2010.https://www.iberkshires.com/story/35076/Pittsfield-Unveils-Restored- Monument-Towns-Cities-Mark-Memorial-Day.html * Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial, DeKalb County, Georgia, near Atlanta, 1925-1928; preceded in this project by Gutzon Borglum, and followed by Walker Hancock.

He was Leader of the Opposition from 1991 to 1995. He served as Prime Minister for the first time from December 1995 until September 2000, and became Leader of the Opposition again from October 2000 to 4 July 2005. On 5 July 2005, he became prime minister for a second term after his Alliance Sociale won the general elections. He served again as Prime Minister from 2005 to 2014, when he was defeated afterwards. ==Early life and education== Navin Ramgoolam was born on 14 July 1947 to Dr. Seewoosagur Ramgoolam (SSR) and Sushil Ramjoorawon at their Desforges Street residence in Port Louis. SSR was the 6th Governor General of Mauritius, as well as the first Chief Minister and Prime Minister of Mauritius. In the 1800s his ancestors migrated to Mauritius from Harigaon in Bhojpur district, Bihar.Navin is married to Veena Ramgoolam. He attended the Royal College Curepipe from 1960 to 1966 and proceeded to study medicine in Ireland between 1968 and 1975, where he obtained the LRCP&SI; licentiates from the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. When his father SSR died in December 1985, Ramgoolam was on the point of immigrating to Canada when Sir Satcam Boolell (then leader of Labour Party) and Paul Berenger (the leader of the Mauritian Militant Movement) convinced him to return assume the leadership of the Labour party with the objective of an alliance which would defeat Anerood Jugnauth in the general elections. He subsequently served as a medical doctor at Dr A.G Jeetoo Hospital in Mauritius from 1985 to 1987. In 1987, he started his law studies at The London School of Economics and Political Science, University of London. Upon completion of his LLB degree in 1990, he returned to Mauritius to face the electorate as the new leader of the Labour party in the 1991 general election. Navin Ramgoolam with former Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh. Navin Ramgoolam with Obamas. ==1991 elections and first candidacy== The leadup to the general elections held in 1991 saw a realignment of the country's major political parties. The Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM), which had been the main opposition party, decided to contest the election as an ally of Prime Minister Anerood Jugnauth's Militant Socialist Movement (MSM). Ramgoolam's Labour Party and Ga√´tan Duval's Parti Mauricien Social D√©mocrate (PMSD), both of which had been allied with the MSM in the previous election, formed a separate alliance, along with the Rodrigues People's Organisation (OPR). A major campaign issue was the proposal of the MSM-MMM alliance to cut the country's ties with the British Monarchy and declare a republic with a President as head of state. Ramgoolam opposed this, arguing that the Presidential office would be too ceremonial, leaving all executive powers effectively in the hands of the Prime Minister. The election turned out to be a landslide for Jugnauth. The MSM/MMM alliance won 57 of the 62 directly elected seats. Of the 5 seats won by Ramgoolam's alliance, 2 were held by the OPR and 3 by his own Labour Party (Arvin Boolell, Vasant Bunwaree and himself, being elected in constituency 5, Triolet & Pamplemoussess). Following his defeat, he took leave as Leader of the Opposition and returned to London to complete his law vocational course at Inns of Court School of Law. He was called to United Kingdom Bar, Inner Temple in 1993. In 1993, Prime Minister Jugnauth asked the Speaker of the National Assembly to declare Ramgoolam's seat vacant as he had not attended Parliament for three consecutive moments. The Speaker referred the case to the Court but the Judge found that it was unconstitutional. Shortly afterwards, Jugnauth dismissed B√©renger from the Cabinet after learning that Ramgoolam had hosted him at a private dinner at his Riverwalk residence. B√©renger and 10 MMM members joined Ramgoolam on the opposition benches. Although the MMM caucus was larger than the Labour Party caucus, he agreed to let Ramgoolam continue as Leader of the Opposition. ==1995 elections== The Labour Party and the MMM went on to forge an alliance to contest the 1995 elections. The alliance won all 60 directly elected seats from the mainland (with Labour taking 35 seats and the MMM 25). Ramgoolam became Prime Minister with B√©renger as his Deputy. The coalition soon fractured and Ramgoolam dismissed B√©renger in 1997. B√©renger then became Leader of the Opposition, while Ramgoolam formed a one-party government. ==2000 elections== Jugnauth and B√©renger formed a new alliance to contest the 2000 elections. Part of the agreement was to allow Jugnauth to serve for the first three years of the five-year term, then resign to assume the Presidency and allow B√©renger to complete his unexpired term. Ramgoolam, for his part, formed an alliance with the Mauritian Party of Xavier-Luc Duval (PMXD), a breakaway from the PMSD led by Xavier-Luc Duval, the son of Sir Ga√´tan Duval. The MSM/MMM alliance won 54 of the 60 directly elected mainland seats. Ramgoolam, who had retained his own seat, became Leader of the Opposition. ==2005 elections== His Alliance Social won the general elections against the MSM/MMM outgoing government. He was again appointed as prime minister with a majority of 38 out of 60 seats. His alliance also won the local/municipal elections in 2006 where the MSM/MMM was severely defeated. These consecutive defeats and internal instability caused the break-up of the MSM/MMM coalition. As the MSM had more seats than the MMM and Pravind Jugnauth was not elected, Nando Bodha was appointed as Leader of the Opposition. ==2010 elections== With the 2010 elections approaching, Ramgoolam decided in 2008 to support Jugnauth for re-election as President, to forestall a possible return by Jugnauth to parliamentary politics, where Ramgoolam viewed him as a potential threat. Jugnauth's condition for accepting the offer was an alliance between the Labour Party and the MSM. At Ramgoolam's insistence, the Alliance de L'Avenir also included the PMSD, into which the PMXD, and its leader, Xavier-Luc Duval, had merged; seven of the sixty parliamentary candidates would come from the PMSD). The Alliance de L'Avenir won 41 of the 60 directly elected seats. Ramgoolam remained Prime Minister and Pravind Jugnauth, son of Sir Anerood Jugnauth, became his Deputy. Following the involvement of some members of the MSM in the Medpoint Scandal, however, Ramgoolam dismissed the MSM from the government. ==2014 elections== The general elections originally scheduled for 2015 were brought forward to December 2014. The Labour Party made a new alliance with the MMM, proposing a constitutional amendment to upgrade the Presidency to a less ceremonial role. Ramgoolam and B√©renger, the MMM leader, claimed that the election was a referendum on the proposal, which they called the Second Republic. If the alliance won more than 45 of the 60 directly elected mainland seats, the Constitution would be amended; Ramgoolam would run for the Presidency and B√©renger would succeed him as Prime Minister. Ramgoolam and Berenger were opposed by the MSM-led Alliance Lepep, which also included the PMSD, which had been Ramgoolam's coalition partner, and a new party called Muvman Liberater, formed by a significant portion of ex-members of the MMM who were opposed to the idea of giving Ramgoolam more powers . The Alliance Lepep, which opposed the proposal for the Second Republic, won 47 seats out of 60. The Labour-MMM alliance won only 13 seats, 9 from the MMM and 4 from the Labour Party. Ramgoolam lost his seat for the first time in his political career. On 12 December 2014, he resigned as Prime Minister of Mauritius. Moreover, in February 2015, he was arrested for alleged conspiracy and money laundering; as part of a robbery case, local police searching his home discovered coffers storing cash amounting to $6.4 million in various foreign currencies https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2015/03/changing- fortunes-mauritius-ousted-leaders-150309095143234.html. He was later released and charges against him were dropped due to lack of sufficient evidence and the prosecution's delay in lodging the case https://defimedia.info/preliminary-charges-dropped-against-navin-ramgoolam https://supremecourt.govmu.org/HighlightDoc/prov%20information-%20N%20ramgooolam.pdf. ==Award== Ramgoolam receives Pravasi Bharatiya Samman from President of India in 2008 In 2008 he has received the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman from the President of India.https://web.archive.org/web/20141228131301/http://moia.gov.in/services.aspx?ID1=34&id;=m2&idp;=30&mainid;=23 ==Honours== Navin Ramgoolam with former Prime Minister of United Kingdom, David Cameron. Ramgoolam has received several accolades and honours. In 1998 he was made an Honorary Fellow of the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), Dr Honoris Causa by the University of Mauritius, Dr Honoris Causa from Aligarh Muslim University, India and Dr Honoris Causa by the Jawaharlal Nehru University, India in October 2005. Other awards he attained are the Grand Officier de la Legion d‚ÄôHonneur from France in March 2006, the Honorary Freeman of Rodrigues from Rodrigues Regional Assembly in March 2007, The Wilberforce Medal from Wilberforce Lecture Trust, Hull, United Kingdom in June 2007, The Rajiv Gandhi Award from Mumbai Regional Congress Committee, India in August 2007, The Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Award from Government of the Republic of India in January 2008 as well as Grand Commander of the Order of the Star and Key of the Indian Ocean (GCSK) from the Government of the Republic of Mauritius in March 2008. In Paris, Ramgoolam received the Prix Louise Michel, awarded generally each year to a high personality in recognition of his or her outstanding contribution in the political field. He was made Doctor of Science (Honoris Causa) by the Padmashree Dr D. Y. Patil University, Mumbai, India in February 2009, Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (FRCP) of the Royal College of Physicians, London in May 2009, Honorary Doctor by Staffordshire University, United Kingdom in July 2010, Order of the Rule of Law by the World Jurist Association, Bethesda, Maryland, USA in April 2011, Overseas Bencher by the Inner Temple, United Kingdom in April 2011 and Doctor of Laws (Honoris Causa) by the Kurukshetra University, Haryana, India in February 2012. ==See also== * Veena Ramgoolam * Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam * Prime Minister of Mauritius * Leader of the Opposition (Mauritius) *Bihari Mauritians ==References== == External links == * * * - Category:1947 births Category:Alumni of the London School of Economics Category:Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians Category:Grand Commanders of the Order of the Star and Key of the Indian Ocean Category:Grand Officiers of the L√©gion d'honneur Category:Labour Party (Mauritius) politicians Category:Leaders of the Opposition (Mauritius) Category:Living people Category:Mauritian Hindus Category:Mauritian politicians of Indian descent Category:Members of the National Assembly (Mauritius) Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Prime Ministers of Mauritius Category:Foreign Ministers of Mauritius Category:Ministers of Finance of Mauritius Category:Honorary Fellows of the London School of Economics Category:Children of national leaders Category:Recipients of Pravasi Bharatiya Samman ","title":"Navin Ramgoolam"},{"id":"1426278","text":"The Bionic Tower (Spanish: Torre Bi√≥nica; Chinese: ‰ªøÁîüÂ°î) was a visionary vertical city, an extremely large building designed for human habitation by Spanish architects Eloy Celaya, Mar√≠a Rosa Cervera and Javier G√≥mez. It would have a main tower high, with 300 stories housing approximately 100,000 people. The Bionic Tower would be exactly 400 meters taller than the current tallest building, Burj Khalifa. The point of the Bionic Tower is to use Bionics to solve the world's rising population problems in an eco-friendly way, an incredibly difficult feat to accomplish. The Bionic Tower is composed of two complexes put together. The first complex, Bionic Tower, is made up of twelve vertical neighborhoods, each eighty meters high. The neighborhoods are separated by safety areas to make for easier construction and evacuation in case of an emergency. Each neighborhood has two groups of buildings, one on the interior of the building and one on the exterior. Both groups of buildings are situated around large gardens and pools. The second complex, called the Base Island, is 1,000 meters in diameter, and is made up of many buildings, gardens, pools, and communication infrastructures. Foreseen uses of these complexes include hotels, offices, residential, commerce, cultural, sports and leisure. In 1997 work on the prototype Bionic Vertical Space began. This was developed by the architects Eloy Celaya, Mar√≠a Rosa Cervera and Javier G√≥mez through the beginning of 2001. However, Eloy Celaya, who studied at Columbia University, is developing another project similar to the Bionic Tower project.

It is the second longest river by watershed area or length in Norrbotten County (after the Torne River and very slightly ahead of the Kalix River, which is 460.65 km long), but is the largest by average discharge. It has a watershed of 25,240.5 km¬≤ of which 24,545.6 km¬≤ is in Sweden and 694.9 km¬≤ in Norway. The river is an important source of hydroelectric energy, with major hydroelectric plants at e.g. Porjus and the 977 MW Harspr√•nget, commissioned in 1952 and expanded in 1983 to become Sweden's largest hydro power station.Mellgren, Erik. \\"Third time counted for Harspr√•nget\\", Ny Teknik 28 July 2012. Retrieved: 7 August 2012. The river was used extensively for the transportation of timber, with logs floated downstream for processing at Lule√•, but this stopped in the early 1980s. Several major rapids exist along the river's length, notably the Stora Falls and those at Porjus and Harspr√•nget. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the river was designated as a defensive line against an invasion from Imperial Russia and subsequently the Soviet Union. Extensive fortifications exist along the entire length of the river, culminating in Bodens Fortress in and around the city of Boden. Most of these fortifications and bunkers are no longer in use today. The Greater Lule River (Big Lule River) arguably begins somewhere near S√•rj√•sjaure in the mountains west of G√§llivare. The water flows to the Virihaure lake, which also collects water from Kerkevare (via Kettaurejokk) and Alkajaure (via Mill√§tno). The Tukejokk joins the Lule as well in Virihaure. Leaving Virihaure to the north, the river reaches the Vastenjaure lake after losing 32m over 2.2 km. It then flows via the Vuojat√§tno to lake Kutjaure and then Luoktanjarkajaure, collecting a lot of water from other lakes in Sarek National Park, like Salohaure, and from the Swedish-Norwegian border. There are numerous waterfalls and rapids in the river. The best known is Stora Sj√∂fallet at the end of the Akkajaure lake, where the water falls 39.6 m from K√•rtjejaure to Langasjaure. In this lake the Vietasajokk joins the Lule. The Stora Lule tr√§sk is the largest of the lakes in the river. Here it reaches the forest, and after the lake is joined by the Muddus River from Muddus National Park. At 75m, near the village of Vuollerim, the river joins with the Lesser Lule River. The Lule passes the Porsiforsen (25m over 2 km), Edefors and Hedens fors. It flows into the Baltic Sea through the B√§lingefj√§rden and Lulefj√§rden. Other rivers in the watershed of the Lule with a length of more than 100 km are: Black River (Sweden), Flark√•n, Lesser Lule River, P√§rl River, Rissaj√•kk√•, Vietas√§tno, and Bodtr√§sk√•n. aurora borealis.

The UID, along with the group identifier (GID) and other access control criteria, is used to determine which system resources a user can access. The password file maps textual user names to UIDs. UIDs are stored in the inodes of the Unix file system, running processes, tar archives, and the now-obsolete Network Information Service. In POSIX-compliant environments, the command-line command \`id\` gives the current user's UID, as well as more information such as the user name, primary user group and group identifier (GID). == Process attributes == The POSIX standard introduced three different UID fields into the process descriptor table, to allow privileged processes to take on different roles dynamically: ===Effective user ID=== The effective UID (\`euid\`) of a process is used for most access checks. It is also used as the owner for files created by that process. The effective GID (\`egid\`) of a process also affects access control and may also affect file creation, depending on the semantics of the specific kernel implementation in use and possibly the mount options used. According to BSD Unix semantics, the group ownership given to a newly created file is unconditionally inherited from the group ownership of the directory in which it is created. According to AT&T; UNIX System V semantics (also adopted by Linux variants), a newly created file is normally given the group ownership specified by the \`egid\` of the process that creates the file. Most filesystems implement a method to select whether BSD or AT&T; semantics should be used regarding group ownership of a newly created file; BSD semantics are selected for specific directories when the S_ISGID (s-gid) permission is set. ==== TC: Version v11.16.7 (152.7030ee7e42) - User ID 5473292403148240 ==== Linux also has a file system user ID (\`fsuid\`) which is used explicitly for access control to the file system. It matches the \`euid\` unless explicitly set otherwise. It may be root's user ID only if \`ruid\`, \`suid\`, or \`euid\` is root. Whenever the \`euid\` is changed, the change is propagated to the \`fsuid\`. The intent of \`fsuid\` is to permit programs (e.g., the NFS server) to limit themselves to the file system rights of some given \`uid\` without giving that \`uid\` permission to send them signals. Since kernel 2.0, the existence of \`fsuid\` is no longer necessary because Linux adheres to SUSv3 rules for sending signals, but \`fsuid\` remains for compatibility reasons.Kerrisk, Michael. The Linux Programming Interface. No Starch Press, 2010, p. 171. ===Saved user ID=== The saved user ID (\`suid\`) is used when a program running with elevated privileges needs to do some unprivileged work temporarily; changing \`euid\` from a privileged value (typically \`0\`) to some unprivileged value (anything other than the privileged value) causes the privileged value to be stored in \`suid\`. Later, a program's \`euid\` can be set back to the value stored in \`suid\`, so that elevated privileges can be restored; an unprivileged process may set its \`euid\` to one of only three values: the value of \`ruid\`, the value of \`suid\`, or the value of \`euid\`. ===Real user ID=== The real UID (\`ruid\`) and real GID (\`rgid\`) identify the real owner of the process and affect the permissions for sending signals. A process without superuser privileges may signal another process only if the sender's \`ruid\` or \`euid\` matches receiver's \`ruid\` or \`suid\`. Because a child process inherits its credentials from its parent, a child and parent may signal each other. == Conventions == === Type === POSIX requires the UID to be an integer type. Most Unix-like operating systems represent the UID as an unsigned integer. The size of UID values varies amongst different systems; some UNIX OS's used 15-bit values, allowing values up to 32767, while others such as Linux (before version 2.4) supported 16-bit UIDs, making 65536 unique IDs possible. The majority of modern Unix-like systems (e.g., Solaris-2.0 in 1990, Linux 2.4 in 2001) have switched to 32-bit UIDs, allowing 4,294,967,296 (232) unique IDs. === Reserved ranges === The Linux Standard Base Core Specification specifies that UID values in the range 0 to 99 should be statically allocated by the system, and shall not be created by applications, while UIDs from 100 to 499 should be reserved for dynamic allocation by system administrators and post install scripts. Debian Linux not only reserves the range 100‚Äì999 for dynamically allocated system users and groups, but also centrally and statically allocates users and groups in the range 60000-64999 and further reserves the range 65000‚Äì65533. On FreeBSD, porters who need a UID for their package can pick a free one from the range 50 to 999 and then register the static allocation.http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/porters-handbook/users- and-groups.html Some POSIX systems allocate UIDs for new users starting from 500 (macOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux till version 6), others start at 1000 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux since version 7, openSUSE, Debian). On many Linux systems, these ranges are specified in \`/etc/login.defs\`, for \`useradd\` and similar tools. Central UID allocations in enterprise networks (e.g., via LDAP and NFS servers) may limit themselves to using only UID numbers well above 1000, and outside the range 60000‚Äì65535, to avoid potential conflicts with UIDs locally allocated on client computers. === Special values === * 0: The superuser normally has a UID of zero (0). * ‚àí1: The value \`(uid_t) -1\` is reserved by POSIX to identify an omitted argument. * 65535: This value is still avoided because it was the API error return value when uid_t was 16 bits. * Nobody: Historically, the user \\"nobody\\" was assigned UID \`-2\` by several operating systems, although other values such as 215‚àí1 = 32,767 are also in use, such as by OpenBSD. For compatibility between 16-bit and 32-bit UIDs, many Linux distributions now set it to be 216‚àí2 = 65,534; the Linux kernel defaults to returning this value when a 32-bit UID does not fit into the return value of the 16-bit system calls. An alternative convention assigns the last UID of the range statically allocated for system use (0-99) to nobody: 99. == Alternatives == NFSv4 was intended to help avoid numeric identifier collisions by identifying users (and groups) in protocol packets using textual ‚Äúuser@domain‚Äù names rather than integer numbers. However, as long as operating-system kernels and local file systems continue to use integer user identifiers, this comes at the expense of additional translation steps (using idmap daemon processes), which can introduce additional failure points if local UID mapping mechanisms or databases get configured incorrectly, lost, or out of sync. The ‚Äú@domain‚Äù part of the user name could be used to indicate which authority allocated a particular name, for example in form of * a Kerberos realm name * an Active Directory domain name * the name of an operating-system vendor (for distribution-specific allocations) * the name of a computer (for device-specific allocations) But in practice many existing implementations only allow setting the NFSv4 domain to a fixed value, thereby rendering it useless. ==See also== * setuid * Sticky bit * Group identifier * Process identifier * File system permissions * Open (system call) * Mount (Unix) * FAT access rights * Security Identifier (SID) ‚Äì the Windows NT equivalent ==References== Category:Unix Category:Unix file system technology ","title":"User identifier"},{"id":"1426294","text":"The Dictionary of American Regional English (DARE) is a record of American English as spoken in the United States, from its beginnings to the present. It differs from other dictionaries in that it does not document the standard language used throughout the country. Instead, it contains regional and folk speech, those words, phrases, and pronunciations that vary from one part of the country to another, or that we learn from our families and friends rather than from our teachers and books. For DARE, a \\"region\\" may be as small as a city or part of a city, or as large as most (but not all) of the country. Humanities magazine has described it as \\"a bold synthesis of linguistic atlas and historical dictionary\\", and William Safire called it \\"the most exciting new linguistic project in the twentieth century\\". The Dictionary is based both on face-to-face interviews with 2,777 people carried out in 1,002 communities across the country between 1965 and 1970, and on a large collection of print and (recently) electronic materials, including diaries, letters, novels, histories, biographies, government documents, and newspapers.Ed. Frederic G. Cassidy. Dictionary of American Regional English, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Volume I, 1985. p.xx. These sources are cited in individual entries to illustrate how the words have been used from the 17th century through the beginning of the 21st century. Entries may include pronunciations, variant forms, etymologies, and statements about regional and social distributions of words and forms. Five volumes of text were published by Harvard University Press between 1985 and 2012: Volume I (A‚ÄìC), with Frederic G. Cassidy serving as Chief Editor, appeared in 1985; Volume II (D‚ÄìH), edited by Cassidy and Associate Editor Joan Houston Hall, was published in 1991; Volume III (I‚ÄìO), by Cassidy and Hall, came out in 1996; Volume IV (P‚ÄìSk), by Hall, who succeeded Cassidy as Chief Editor upon his death, appeared in 2002; and Volume V (Sl‚ÄìZ), with Hall as editor, finished the set in 2012. A sixth volume, subtitled \\"Contrastive Maps, Index to Entry Labels, Questionnaire, and Fieldwork Data,\\" edited by Hall with Luanne von Schneidemesser serving as Senior Editor, was published early in 2013. Late that same year, the digital version was launched. DARE chronicles the language of the American people. It is used by teachers, librarians, researchers, physicians, forensic linguists, journalists, historians, and playwrights. ==History== In 1889, when Joseph Wright began editing the English Dialect Dictionary, a group of American philologists founded the American Dialect Society with the ultimate purpose of producing a similar work for the United States. Members of the Society began to collect material, much of which was published in the Society's journal Dialect Notes, but little was done toward compiling a dictionary recording nationwide usage until Frederic G. Cassidy was appointed Chief Editor in 1962.Ed. Frederic G. Cassidy.Dictionary of American Regional English, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Volume I, 1985. p.xii. Cassidy had done fieldwork in Wisconsin for the Linguistic Atlas of the North Central States project and in Jamaica for his Dictionary of Jamaican English. With the assistance of Audrey Duckert, he had also designed and administered an intensive mail-questionnaire survey of Wisconsin (the Wisconsin English Language Survey). Drawing on this experience, he and Duckert made plans for a nationwide, fieldworker- administered questionnaire that would provide a comprehensive foundation for the projected Dictionary. The fieldwork, supported by a grant from the Office of Education, was conducted during 1965‚Äì70. About eighty fieldworkers (mostly graduate students, but also some professors) were trained in phonetic transcription and fieldwork techniques; they were then sent to 1,002 carefully selected communities across the country, chosen to reflect population density and to account for settlement history and immigration patterns.Ed. Frederic G. Cassidy.Dictionary of American Regional English, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Volume I, 1985. p.xii-xiii. Each fieldworker was required to find \\"informants,\\" people willing to provide information about words, who were natives of their communities and who had lived there all, or almost all, their lives. The informants were then asked to answer the questions in the DARE questionnaire. In many communities more than one person contributed answers, so the total number of informants, 2,777, is much larger than the number of communities.Hall, Joan Houston. \\"The Dictionary of American Regional English.\\" Language in the USA: Perspectives for the 21st Century. Eds. Edward Finegan, John Rickford. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004. p.95. While the fieldworkers were interviewing people across the country, Cassidy and others in Madison organized an extensive volunteer reading program. Printed materials of all kinds were selected and sent to volunteers, who read them and identified regional words in context. These resources included historical and contemporary newspapers, diaries, letters, histories, biographies, novels, and government documents. A number of important unpublished collections of dialect materials were also donated to DARE for use in documenting the Dictionary entries.Ed. Frederic G. Cassidy.Dictionary of American Regional English, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Volume I, 1985. p.xv. As the fieldworkers sent their questionnaires back to Madison, the approximately 2.3 million answers were keypunched, and software was written to create a question-by-question tabulation of responses as well as an index.Ed. Frederic G. Cassidy.Dictionary of American Regional English, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Volume I, 1985. p.xiv-xv. In addition, programs were written that allowed the interactive creation of maps showing where the responses were found and the production of statistical tables itemizing the age, sex, race, education level, and community type for each person who gave a particular response. These tools allow DARE editors to apply regional labels to entries based on where words were collected in the fieldwork project and to use social labels describing individuals who use those words.Ed. Frederic G. Cassidy.Dictionary of American Regional English, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Volume I, 1985. p.xx. In 1974, Cassidy contracted with Harvard University Press to publish the Dictionary, and editing began in earnest in 1975. By 1980 it was clear that the idea of writing and publishing DARE as a single unit was impossible. Early estimates of the time it would take to write and revise entries had been overly optimistic. Following the tradition of other historical dictionaries such as the Oxford English Dictionary, DARE decided to publish each volume as it was ready. Because Cassidy had contracted to supply the text of the Dictionary on magnetic tape fully coded for typesetting, with camera-ready maps, a production department had to be set up. A system was devised for coding the many specifications for format, type size and style, and special characters. Procedures were worked out for the meticulous checking and correcting of text that would be required. ==Features== ===Contents of volumes, maps, and labels=== Six print volumes of the DARE have been published by Harvard University‚Äôs Belknap Press. Volume I (1985) contains detailed introductory material, plus the letters A-C; Volume II (1991) covers the letters D-H; Volume III (1996) contains I-O; Volume IV (2002) includes P-Sk; and Volume V (2012) covers Sl-Z as well as a bibliography of nearly 13,000 sources cited in the five volumes. (Starting with Volume IV, digital libraries provided many valuable resources for expanding the historical coverage of the entries.) Volume VI (2013) includes more than 1,700 maps showing contrastive distributions of regional synonyms (such as hero, hoagie, grinder, sub, torpedo, poor boy, and Cuban, all of which describe a sandwich in a long bun), as well as social distributions of regional terms (by age, sex, race, education, and community type). It also includes an index to the regional, usage, and etymological labels used in the five text volumes; the text of the DARE Questionnaire; the responses by all DARE informants to 430 of the questions asked in the original fieldwork. The digital version was launched in December 2013. The five text volumes contain approximately 60,000 headwords and senses in 5,544 pages. There are nearly 3,000 computer-generated distribution maps included in the text, showing where the words were found during the fieldwork. The first volume also includes 156 pages of introductory matter, with an extensive introduction, an explanation of DARE‚Äôs regions and maps, an essay on how language changes, a guide to pronunciation, text of the questionnaire, and a list of informants (showing where and when they were interviewed, the community type, the person's age, sex, race, occupation, education, and whether the person made an audiotape). An unusual feature of DARE is its inclusion of maps showing where words were found during the nationwide fieldwork. The maps are adjusted to reflect population density rather than geographic area, so they look a bit strange at first, but one learns to \\"read\\" them quickly. Whenever possible, the editors apply regional labels to the entries, based both on the maps from the field survey and on the written citations. (There are nearly forty regional labels listed in the front matter to Volume I, but the most frequently used in the text of the Dictionary tend to be from the \\"South,\\" \\"South Midland,\\" \\"North,\\" \\"New England,\\" \\"Northeast,\\" \\"West,\\" \\"Gulf States,\\" and \\"southern Appalachians.\\") Since language is not restricted by state or regional boundaries, the labels often include qualifying language, such as \\"chiefly N[ew] Eng[land],\\" or \\"scattered, but most freq[uent] S[ou]th, S[outh] Midl[and].\\" If the evidence from the fieldwork shows that a term is used disproportionately frequently by a particular social group (based on age, sex, race, education, or community type), a \\"social\\" label such as \\"old-fash[ioned],\\" \\"chiefly among women,\\" or \\"esp[ecially] freq[uent] among Black speakers\\" will also be applied. The digital version is available by subscription (for libraries or individuals) and perpetual access (libraries). In addition to the Basic Search, which yields both headwords and variant forms, an Advanced Search function allows Boolean searches of full text, headwords, parts of speech, variant forms, definitions, etymologies, quotations, and regional or social labels. Quotations link directly to specific entries in the bibliography, where users can link to every other quotation from that particular source. The digital DARE also offers features based on the original fieldwork survey: *Users can click on a state on the DARE map, or select from any of 41 regions in a pull- down menu (e.g., Appalachians, Desert Southwest, Gulf States, North Central, South Atlantic), to get to a link to \\"View all entries for [that state or region].\\" Because language does not adhere to state or regional boundaries, the user is also guided to a list of larger regions of which the state or region is a part, with links to searches for additional words characteristic of that area. *All entries that include quotations based on the DARE survey have links to the questions cited in the entry. Clicking a link allows the user to go to the DARE map and call up any response (or group of responses) to that question.Metcalf, Allan. \\"A Bite of DARE. Chronicle of Higher Education 16 Dec., 2013. http://chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2013/12/16/a-bite-of- dare/. By mapping selected synonyms, the user can see regional distributions instantaneously. Users can also see the social distributions (by age, sex, race, education, and community type) of the people who offered a given response. Scholars who want to see the raw demographic data can download it as an Excel spreadsheet. *More than 5,000 audio clips from the original DARE interviews are included in entries. Users can click on audio icons to hear bits of conversation recorded between 1965 and 1970 with people from all corners of the US. *From the Results List of a search, users can filter the entries based on their inclusion of an audio clip, a DARE map, or a quotation from the DARE survey. Within the DARE Survey tab, searches can be refined by specific variables within the categories of age, sex, race, education, and community type.

In addition to a history of the DARE project and its fieldwork, it includes introductory matter from the first print volume, an Index of virtually all the regional, social, usage, and etymological labels in the five volumes of text, a pronunciation guide and abbreviation list, the Questionnaire and List of Informants, and all the contrastive maps that are included in Volume VI of the print version of DARE. There is an \\"Introduction to Contrastive Maps,\\" followed by about 1,400 geographic maps showing regional synonyms for various concepts, and more than 300 maps showing differences in usage by people according to their age, sex, race, education, and community type. An index follows, with all the words that are mapped, making it easy to start with a question about a specific term and go directly to a regional or social map. ===Informants=== Some 2,777 people in 1,002 American communities served as DARE informants by answering all or part of the DARE questionnaire. Each person was a native of the selected community and had lived there all (or almost all) his or her life. The \\"List of Informants\\" in the front matter to Volume I of DARE includes the following details for each participant: informant code (a state abbreviation and a number, e.g., AL001 for the first informant interviewed in Alabama); community name; community type (urban, large city, small city, village, rural); age group (60 or older=old, 40‚Äì59=middle-aged, 18‚Äì39=young); year of birth; year of interview; education level (unknown; less than grade five; at least grade five; at least two years of high school; at least two years of college or vocational school); occupation; sex; race; and whether the informant made an audiotape recording. At the end of the \\"List of Informants\\" is a supplementary list of people who made audiotape recordings but who did not answer any parts of the questionnaire. Fieldworkers were asked to weight their selection of informants toward older people in an effort to collect words for objects and practices that were going out of use. As a result, 66% of the DARE informants were over 60 when interviewed between 1965 and 1970; 24% were middle-aged; and 10% were young. Knowing the proportion of informants from each age group who gave a particular response and contrasting that to the proportion of informants from each age group who answered that particular question allows DARE editors to detect which words appear to be old-fashioned and which are coming into greater use.Ed. Frederic G. Cassidy.Dictionary of American Regional English, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. Volume I, 1985. p.xiv. ===Questionnaire=== The DARE questionnaire included a total of 1,847 questions; some that proved not to be fruitful in the early interviews were dropped, with others being added in their place. The questionnaire aimed to elicit responses about the everyday activities in Americans' lives. It includes 41 sections, starting with the neutral subjects of time and weather and moving to more personal subjects such as religion and health. Also included are the questions used in the early questionnaire only. The text of each question is included in the front matter to Volume I, and the quotations in the text of the Dictionary usually include full or abbreviated versions of each question; in cases where only the question number is cited, a reader can refer to the front matter. The categories are listed below:Ed. Frederic G. Cassidy.Dictionary of American Regional English, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.

The use of the reading passage, a contrived story called \\"Arthur the Rat\\" that was designed to elicit all significant pronunciation variants in American English, allows comparison of sounds in the same context from places all across the country. The use of free conversation elicited the introduction of topics not covered in the questionnaire, resulting in a corpus of informal speech that can be contrasted to the formal style of the reading passage. It also provides an extremely valuable oral history of mid-20th-century America. In all, 1,843 DARE informants agreed to make audiotape recordings. They are noted in the \\"List of Informants\\" in the front matter to Volume I of DARE, in the last column, marked \\"Audiotape.\\" In a project with the Max Kade Institute for German-American Studies, the Center for the Study of Upper Midwestern Cultures, and the University of Wisconsin Digital Collection Center, DARE has made its collection of readings of \\"Arthur the Rat\\" available for listeners. (This collaborative project was funded by the Institute for Museum and Library Services.) These recordings have been posted at \\"American Languages: Our Nation's Many Voices\\" (http://uwdc.library.wisc.edu/collections/AmerLangs). (Use the \\"Guided Search\\" option, enter \\"Arthur the Rat\\" as a phrase in \\"Any Field,\\" and enter a state name in the \\"Place/Time\\" field to hear examples from a particular state.) In addition, samples of informal conversation from the DARE audiotapes may be heard at \\"American Languages: Our Nation‚Äôs Many Voices Online\\" (https://web.archive.org/web/20120308044135/http://csumc.wisc.edu/AmericanLanguages/). Additional excerpts will be added as time permits. ==New research== In order to determine how vocabulary use has changed since the original fieldwork was done, DARE staff in 2013 undertook a pilot survey in Wisconsin (\\"2013‚Äì14 survey\\"),Funded by NEH grant P-W-51472, July 1, 2013 ‚Äì June 30, 2015. preliminary to an anticipated new nationwide survey. The updated survey did not use face-to-face interviews with fieldworkers, but instead invited people to answer questions on a website developed by DARE and the University of Wisconsin Survey Center. The new questionnaire, modeled closely on the original, omitted questions for items that are obsolete, updated some terminology, and added questions for items that did not exist in the late 1960s. The survey targeted the original 22 Wisconsin communities, asking residents who had lived there all their lives to participate by answering as many of the 41 sections of the questionnaire as they chose. In addition, new communities, selected as representative of the state on the basis of the 2010 Census, were also targeted. In those communities, residents had to have lived there only fifteen years. Other Wisconsin residents were invited to participate, but their responses have been kept separate from those from \\"official\\" respondents.Cheung, Ariel. \\"Dictionary of American Regional English reboots for new generation.\\" Post-Crescent (Appleton, WI), 16 Apr., 2014. http://www.postcrescent.com/article/20140415/APC0101/304150377/Dictionary- American-Regional-English-reboots-new-generation. Results of the online survey may be seen at http://dare.wisc.edu/survey-results. ==Quarterly updates== Beginning in summer 2015, DARE staff members began publishing quarterly updates on the project website: http://dare.wisc.edu/words/quarterly-updates. These include both new and significantly revised entries. Harvard University Press will incorporate them in annual updates to the digital version. ==Funding== DARE has been supported financially by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the National Science Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, other private foundations, and many individuals. The DARE offices are located in the English Department at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, and the university has provided generous support, particularly in the form of funding for graduate assistants. (See https://web.archive.org/web/20170527210859/http://dare.wisc.edu/about/funding.)

Translated as \\"Troop Leader\\", the rank of Truppf√ºhrer evolved from early Freikorps titles which traced their origins to World War I. As an SA rank, Truppf√ºhrer was considered the equivalent of a senior sergeant, or sergeant first class. The rank of SA-Truppf√ºhrer was at first considered senior to that of SA- Scharf√ºhrer, but after 1932 was ranked above the new rank of SA- Oberscharf√ºhrer. The insignia for a basic Truppf√ºhrer consisted of two button pips on a collar patch. A Truppf√ºhrer normally served as the SA-non- commissioned officer of platoon sized SA-Truppen, formed into company sized SA-Sturm. The responsibilities of a Truppf√ºhrer typically increased upon promotion to Obertruppf√ºhrer and Haupttruppf√ºhrer, as did the number of troops under the Truppf√ºhrer‚Äôs command. Between 1930 and 1934, Truppf√ºhrer was also used as an SS rank but was abolished after the Night of the Long Knives when the rank of SS-Truppf√ºhrer was renamed SS-Oberscharf√ºhrer. { class=\\"toccolours\\" border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border- collapse: collapse; margin: 0.5em auto; clear: both;\\" - width=\\"30%\\" align=\\"center\\"Junior Rank Oberscharf√ºhrer width=\\"40%\\" align=\\"center\\"SA rank Truppf√ºhrer width=\\"30%\\" align=\\"center\\"Senior Rank Obertruppf√ºhrer } ==Insignia== File:NSFK-Truppf√ºhrer.svgNSFK File:NSKK- Truppf√ºhrer.svgNSKK File:OT-Truppf√ºhrer.svgOT File:RAD-Truppf√ºhrer.svgRAD File:SA-Truppf√ºhrer.svgSA == Notes == == Bibliography == * * Category:Nazi paramilitary ranks ","title":"Truppf√ºhrer"},{"id":"1426300","text":"The EMD NW3 was a road switcher diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division of La Grange, Illinois between November 1939 and March 1942. A total of seven were built for the Great Northern Railway, the sole original purchaser; they were originally numbered #5400-5406 and later renumbered #175-181. The locomotive fundamentally consists of an NW2 hood, prime mover (a V12 EMD 567 diesel engine) and main generator on a long frame with road trucks (Blomberg Bs). The extra length was used for a large cab and an additional, full-width hood section, which contained a steam generator for passenger service. The boiler's exhaust was in the front center of the cab, between the front windows and exiting at the middle of the roof front. The locomotives were delivered in GN's black diesel paint scheme of the time, but were later repainted in the bright, orange and green \\"Empire Builder\\" scheme. The short exhaust stacks as delivered were at some point replaced by standard conical EMD switcher stacks. The first four locomotives were traded in by GN to EMD on new locomotives in 1965. The remaining three locomotives were sold to other railroads: #179 was sold to A.E. Staley Co. of Morrisville, Pennsylvania, keeping the same number; then locomotive #179 was purchased by Locomotive Trouble Shooters, from Fairless Hills, PA 19030 and the engine was replaced, #180 was sold to the Clinchfield Railroad as their #361; #181 went to Anaconda Aluminum as their #100. The Clinchfield locomotive was scrapped; the Anaconda Aluminum unit is on display at the Whitefish, Montana depot in its GN \\"Empire Builder\\" colors, locomotive #179 was still in service in Morrisville, Pennsylvania . The January 2019 issue of Railfan & Railroad magazine featured a picture of No. 179 on page 26 with accompanying text stating the locomotive was scrapped on November 30, 2018. Additional text on page 15 stated \\"Though the final owner, Tate & Lyle, made some effort to find a buyer, there were no takers. The high cost of trucking the oversized unit from the site was an inhibiting factor for many museums and historical societies.\\" This leaves the restored GN 181 on static display near the Amtrak station in Whitefish, MT, as the sole surviving EMD NW3. ==See also== * List of GM-EMD locomotives ==References== * * Ringnalda, Ben.

This text changed how Britons thought their empire should relate to the rest of the world. He warned that Britain could not keep its Empire by its \\"splendid isolation\\". Britain would need to fight to gain its empire, and by using the colonies as a resource for soldiers and sailors it grew by an average of per year between the Battle of Waterloo and the American Civil War. Serving in the Royal Engineers in the Napoleonic Wars, he was Europe's leading demolitions expert and siege warfare specialist. ==Life== Pasley was born at Eskdale Muir, Dumfriesshire, on 8 September 1780. He was highly intelligent, capable of translating the New Testament from Greek at the age of eight. In 1796, he entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich; a year later he gained his commission in the Royal Artillery, and he was transferred to the Royal Engineers in 1798. Sir John Moore He was present in the defence of Gata, the Battle of Maida, and the siege of Copenhagen. In 1807, then a captain, he went to the Iberian Peninsula, where his knowledge of the Spanish language led to his employment on the staff of Sir David Baird and Sir John Moore. He took part in the retreat to Corunna and the Walcheren Expedition, and received a severe wound while gallantly leading a storming party at Flushing. During his tedious recovery, he employed himself in learning German. After discontinuing service, he devoted the rest of his life to the foundation of a complete military engineering science and to the thorough organization and training of the corps of Royal Engineers. Though only a captain, his great success led him to act as the commanding royal engineer at Plymouth for two years and was given a special grant. Because the events of the Peninsular War emphasized the need for a fully trained engineer corps, the war office adopted Pasley's views. He was placed at the head of the new School of Military Engineering at Woolwich in 1812. In 1816 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Palsey developed a new form of pontoon bridge which was adopted in 1817 by the British Army. Each pontoon was split into two-halves and you could connect two pointed ends together in cases where you had tidal flow. Each half was enclosed, so reducing the risk of swamping and there were multiple lashing points. The \\"Pasley Pontoon\\" lasted until it was replaced in 1836. Concurrently, Pasley was gazetted brevet major. He became brevet lieutenant- colonel in 1813 and substantive lieutenant-colonel in 1814. The first volume of his Military Instruction appeared in 1814 and contained a course of practical geometry which he had framed for his company at Plymouth. Two other volumes completing the work appeared by 1817 and dealt with the science and practice of fortification, the latter comprising rules for construction. He published a work on Practical Architecture and prepared an important treatise on The Practical Operations of a Siege (1829‚Äì1832), which was translated into French (1847). He became brevet colonel in 1830 and substantive colonel in 1831. From 1831 to 1834, he focused his attention on the standardization of coins, weights and measures, publishing a book on the topic in 1834. In 1838, he was presented with the freedom of the city of London for his services in removing sunken vessels from the bed of the Thames near Gravesend. From 1839 to 1844, he was occupied with clearing away the wrecks of from Spithead and from St. Helens. All this work was subsidiary to his great work of creating a comprehensive art of military engineering. ==Railway Inspectorate== On 23 November 1841, on promotion to the rank of major-general, he was made an inspector-general of railways, replacing Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Frederic Smith. During this period of intense activity on the new railway network, he inspected many new lines, criticising the haste in which some were opened to poor engineering standards. However, he came under criticism for his approval of the North British Railway's line from Edinburgh to Berwick in June 1846; the bridges and earthworks failed to withstand heavy rain in September 1846 and nineteen miles of track were rendered unusable. Temporary works were undertaken to restore a service, Pasley approved them (orally), but some of the new work then proved faulty. In November 1846, the inspectorate was reorganised, with no post for Pasley in the new structure: on vacating this appointment, he was made a K.C.B., and thenceforward was chiefly concerned with the East India Company's military seminary at Addiscombe. He was promoted lieutenant-general in 1851, made colonel commandant of the Royal Engineers in 1853, and general in 1860. He died in London on 19 April 1861. His eldest son, Major-General Charles Pasley (1824‚Äì1890), was a distinguished Royal Engineer officer. His daughter Margaret married railway inspector and MP Henry Whatley Tyler. In 1826, as lecturer in architecture and engineering at the Royal School of Military Engineering at Chatham, he began research and experiments on artificial hydraulic cement, attempting to match or make an improvement over natural or \\"Roman\\" cement, invented by James Parker in 1796. In 1830, he succeeded and with chalk and Medway clay, produced a hydraulic lime equal to the natural \\"Roman\\" cement and similar to that produced by Joseph Aspdin in Wakefield. ==Works== Among Pasley's works, besides the aforementioned, were separate editions of his Practical Geometry Method (1822) and of his Course of Elementary Fortification (1822), both of which formed part of his Military Instruction; Rules for Escalading Fortifications not having Palisaded Covered Ways (1822; new eds. 1845 and 1854); descriptions of a semaphore invented by himself in 1804 (1822 and 1823); A Simple Practical Treatise on Field Fortification (1823); and Exercise of the Newdecked Pontoons invented by Lieutenant-Colonel Pasley (1823). ===Links to works=== * Essay on the Military Policy and institutions of the British Empire by Charles Pasley (2nd ed., 1811): Part I ==See also== *Dee bridge disaster *Penmanshiel Tunnel *Railway Inspectorate ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== *PR Lewis and C Gagg, Interdisciplinary Science Reviews, 45, 29, (2004). *PR Lewis, Disaster on the Dee: Robert Stephenson's Nemesis of 1847, Tempus Publishing (2007) * * == External links == *[ Royal Engineers Museum - Sapper Biographies] Category:1780 births Category:1861 deaths Category:British Empire Category:British military writers Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath Category:Royal Engineers officers Category:British Army personnel of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Graduates of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich Category:People from Dumfries and Galloway Category:Fellows of the Royal Society ","title":"Charles Pasley"},{"id":"1426307","text":"Kemptville Campus is a campus of the Ontario Agricultural College, University of Guelph, and is located in Eastern Ontario, approximately 30 minutes south of Ottawa in Kemptville, Ontario. ==Programs== It was established in 1917 as Kemptville College and offers programs related to agricultural and rural fields.

Instead, evil is rather the absence, or lack (‚Äúprivation‚Äù), of good. This also means that everything that exists is good, insofar as it exists; and is also sometimes stated as that evil ought to be regarded as nothing, or as something non-existent. It is often associated with a version of the problem of evil: if some things in the world were to be admitted to be evil, this could be taken to reflect badly on the creator of the world, who would then be difficult to admit to be completely good. The merit of the doctrine in serving as a response to this version of the problem of evil is disputed. ==History== The doctrine is sometimes said to be rooted in Plato. While Plato never directly stated the doctrine, it was developed, based on his remarks on evil, by the Neoplatonist philosopher Plotinus, chiefly in the eighth tractate of his First Ennead. Neoplatonism was influential on St. Augustine of Hippo, with whom the doctrine is most associated. Augustine, in his Enchiridion, wrote: Also, in his City of God, he wrote: Through Augustine, this doctrine influenced much of Catholic thought on the subject of evil. For instance, Boethius famously proved, in Book III of his Consolation of Philosophy, that ‚Äúevil is nothing‚Äù.

A prolific writer, he also contributed numerous stories to comic books and was an editor, until 1972, for Grosset publishing while writing under a number of pseudonyms including, purportedly, the house pen name \\"Alvin Schwartz\\" and also \\"Richard Mark\\", and using sundry variations of his own name (\\"Joseph Lawrence\\", \\"Joe Green\\", \\"Joseph Verdy\\", \\"Larry Verdi\\", \\"Lawrence Vert\\"), which exemplified such foreign-language wordplays for \\"Green\\" as \\"Verdy\\", \\"Verdi\\" and \\"Vert\\". ==Comics== Joseph Greene was involved in many key titles during the so-called Golden Age of Comic Books, during the late 1930s and early 1940s. He apparently acted as \\"a ghost writer for the some of most famous comic characters of the era\\", including The Green Lama, Spunky and Golden Lad (for Spark Publications).Joseph Greene's Tom Corbett Connection By \\"Cadet Ed\\". Accessed May 7, 2008 In 1942, he is believed to have begun working for DC Comics on their All-American line of characters including Aquaman, Boy Commandos, Green Arrow, Hawkman, Superman and Wonder Woman.Biography by Joe Desris, in Batman Archives, Volume 3 (DC Comics, 1994), p. 223 Note: Alvin Schwartz casts doubt on some of the information surrounding Greene's credits, writing that: :::::::::: Alvin Schwartz, \\"After the Golden Age,\\" vol. 2, #53 (October 14, 2002). Accessed May 8, 2008 He is also said to have worked for comics publishers including the American Comics Group, Better Publications (including on The Fighting Yank), Dell Publications (including Tom Corbett, Space Cadet), Lev Gleason Publications, Marvel Comics as well as Fawcett Comics and Hillman Periodicals for which, during the early 1950s, he wrote various romance comics.Joe Greene at the Who's Who of American Comic Books by Jerry Bails et al.. Accessed May 7, 2008 According to comics historian Jerry Bails, Greene wrote for Frank Frazetta's syndicated newspaper strip Johnny Comet/Ace McCoy in 1952‚Äì53, and CIO News' first strip, The Adventures of Jim Barry, Trouble Shooter. He also reputedly provided work for the pulp magazine features The Black Bat and The Phantom. ==Early Tom Corbett== Greene also produced work for radio, film and television, most notably for various versions of Tom Corbett. Around 1945, he provided a script for a comic book storyline likely entitled Space Academy, before submitting to Orbit Feature Services, Inc., on January 16, 1946, a script (originally titled The Pirates of Space, but subsequently revised to Space Cadets) for a prospective radio show featuring primary cadet Tom Ranger.Tom Corbett Timeline. Accessed May 8, 2008 The following year, Greene refined the title as Space Academy, submitting another radio script to NBC, and, ultimately, to Rockhill Studios, which expanded its efforts in working with him to develop it as a show for the newly developing medium of television. By 1949, the title was reconsidered, as both \\"Cadet\\" and \\"Academy\\" were thought to be somewhat ubiquitous ‚Äî indeed, in 1948, Robert A. Heinlein, one of the top names in science fiction, published a novel entitled Space Cadet ‚Äî so the title was expanded (by Greene and Rockhill's Stanley Wolf) to include the name of the main character: Tom Ranger, Space Cadet. In order for this to come about, Rockhill licensed \\"the \\"Space Cadet\\" name from Robert Heinlein... [and] milk[ed] th[e] connection... in its publicity.\\" Thus, in October 1949, Tom Ranger and the Space Cadets was developed as a syndicated newspaper strip, although the strip went unused until it was recycled a few years later. ==Corbett debut on TV and in comics== On October 2, 1950, at the start of TV's third full-schedule season, drawing on the unpublished newspaper strip, and undergoing a last minute name-change, Tom Corbett, Space Cadet premiered on CBS. Eleven months later, on September 9, 1951, a newspaper strip of the same name, written by Paul S. Newman (with unknown levels of input from Greene) and illustrated by (a ghost artist for Milton Caniff on the Steve Canyon strip), made its debut. Distributed by Field Enterprise Syndicate, it drew heavily on the unpublished 1949 Tom Ranger strip, itself recycled and adapted into the first TV episode. In 1951, Greene sued Rockhill over royalty payments, ultimately being awarded a judgment over payments \\"for the television or radio show but not both,\\" as well as full rights (minus royalty fees to Rockhill) to any comic book version of Tom Corbett. Greene wrote Tom Corbett, Space Ranger comics for Dell Publications between 1952 and 1954. In the same year, Grosset & Dunlap began publishing a series of Tom Corbett books, beginning with Stand by for Mars!, while the second and third seasons of Tom Corbett proceeded on ABC television, while a six-month radio show aired on ABC radio. In 1953, with the financially successful release of the theatrical feature It Came From Outer Space, Rockhill sued Universal Pictures for using \\"a modified Practi-Cole Products Tom Corbett helmet\\" in the production. Universal settled the case for $750. ==Corbett books== Published, starting in 1952, by Grosset & Dunlap (which, by the 1950s, was a well-established publisher of series such as Nancy Drew, The Hardy Boys and Rick Brant), the Tom Corbett series was published as a tie-in to the character whose copyright lay with Rockhill Radio, and the plots, which strove to provide inspiration, echoed the radio scripts more than the ones on television or in comics.Tom Corbett: Grosset & Dunlap Books. Accessed May 8, 2008 Written under the name \\"Carey Rockwell\\", the series' authorship is not nearly as well documented as that of the Stratemeyer Syndicate's output, but suggestions naturally include Greene himself as editor (an association made by Jerry Bails) if not also writer. Another possibility names The Cincinnati Kid- author Richard Jessup as a candidate for authorship of the Corbett novels. Technical advice was provided by Willy Ley, one of the leading rocket experts of the 1950s, and also a writer of science fiction who not only \\"helped design the Marx Tom Corbett Space Academy playset\\" for the character, but was known for years as a key voice urging the development of U.S. space exploration and as author of myriad journal articles and books, including contributions to Collier's Man in the Moon series. ==Corbett continues== The series would ultimately run for five seasons, beginning its fourth season on DuMont Network in 1953, and its fifth and final season a year later on NBC. Grosset & Dunlap published its eighth \\"Tom Corbett\\" title (Robot Rocket) in 1955/56, marking the effective end of the series on radio, television, and in books.Tom Corbett: Grosset & Dunlap Books II. Accessed May 8, 2008 Following an investigation by the Internal Revenue Service in 1965 over delinquent taxes, Rockhill's rights to Tom Corbett were purchased by a new entity, Direct Recordings, Inc. while papers owned by Stanley Wolfe were later donated to the University of Southern California. In 1984, Greene gave his personal \\"kinescopes\\" of the television episodes to TV nostalgia merchant Wade Williams, who subsequently assumed some rights to Corbett. In 1990, Eternity Comics produced a five-issue collection of the 1950s newspaper strips, under the title Original Tom Corbett, Space Cadet. ==Books== Greene is likely to have overseen, plotted and edited ‚Äî if not also ghost-written ‚Äî some (or all) of the eight Tom Corbett, Space Cadet novels for Grosset & Dunlap, published between 1952 and 1956. Between 1959 and 1962, he wrote six titles in the Juvenile SF series \\"Dig Allen Space Explorer for Golden Press.\\" These began with 1959's The Forgotten Star, and finished with 1962's Lost City of Uranus. Greene served as an editor at Grosset roughly between 1964 and 1973, ultimately working his way up to the positions of \\"managing editor and acting editor-in-chief before leaving the company.\\" During his semi-retirement in the late 1970s and 1980s, he published a number of independent almanacs - \\"several about astrology and one entitled American Elsewhen Almanac.\\" Joseph Greene's son, Paul, in a letter subsequently reprinted online, indicated that his father died in 1990, the year of his 76th birthday, but the date and circumstances have not been indicated.\\"Who Wrote the Dig Allen Series?\\" on Jonathan K.

Her father is Eochaid S√°lbuide, king of the Ulaid. According to one version of the legend, she asks the druid Cathbad what that day is a good day for, and he replies that it is a good day to conceive a king. There are no other men around, so Ness takes Cathbad to bed, and Conchobar is conceived.Thomas Kinsella (trans.), The T√°in, 1969, p. 3 In other versions,Whitley Stokes (ed. & trans.), \\"Tidings of Conchobar son of Ness\\" √âriu 2, 1908; Kuno Meyer, \\"Anecdota from the Stowe MS No 992\\", Revue Celtique 6, 1883-1885, pp. 171‚Äì186 Ness was brought up by twelve foster-fathers, and was originally called Assa (\\"easy, gentle\\"), because she was such a pleasure to foster. Cathbad, who is a leader of a band of fianna (landless warriors) as well as a druid in this version, attacks her foster-fathers' house, killing them all. Because the culprit cannot be identified, Eochaid is powerless to do anything about it, so Ness forms her own band of 27 fianna to track him down, and becomes known as N√≠-assa (\\"not easy, not gentle\\"), or Ness. However, one day, when she goes off on her own to bathe, Cathbad comes upon her alone and unarmed and demands her as his wife. She has no choice but to agree. Eochaid gives the couple land in Cr√≠ch Rois (a region covering parts of the modern counties of Louth, Monaghan and Meath), near the river Conchobar. One night Cathbad is thirsty, and Ness brings him a drink of water from the river, but when he sees two worms floating in it he makes Ness drink it. Although the story specifically denies this is what makes her pregnant, there are many Irish stories in which significant characters are conceived when their mothers swallowed a tiny creature in a drink. Here, the father of her child is said to be Fachtna F√°thach, the High King of Ireland, who is Ness's lover in spite of Cathbad. While Ness and Cathbad are travelling to visit Fachtna, Ness goes into labour on the bank of the river Conchobar. Cathbad prophesies that if she can wait until the following day before giving birth, her son will share a birthday with Jesus Christ. She sits on a flagstone by the river, and the following day gives birth to a son, who is named Conchobar after the river. The baby tumbles backwards into the river, and Cathbad lifts him out. Cathbad makes a prophecy in verse of his future glory, in which he refers to him as \\"my son and my grandson\\", suggesting there was once a tradition that Cathbad was Ness's father, and that Conchobar was born of incest between them. By the time Conchobar is seven, Fergus mac R√≥ich is king of Ulster, and he falls in love with Ness. She consents to marry him on one condition ‚Äì that he abdicate his kingship for a year in favour of Conchobar, so that his sons will be able to call themselves the sons of a king. Fergus consults with his nobles, and they advise him that the boy will be king in name only, so he agreed. But Conchobar, advised by his mother, is so crafty at distributing wealth and gifts that when the year is up, the Ulstermen won't have Fergus back, and Conchobar keeps the kingship. According to some traditions Ness is the mother of Cormac Cond Longas by incest with Conchobar (although in other traditions, Cormac's mother is Conchobar's wife Clothru).Joseph O'Neill, \\"Cath Boinde\\", √âriu 2, 1905, pp. 173‚Äì185 She is also the mother of Conchobar's sisters Deichtine and Findch√≥em. ==In popular culture== Cartoonist Patrick Brown adapted Ness's story as a webcomic in 2007‚Äì2008.The Ulster Cycle: Ness, webcomic by Patrick Brown. ==References== Category:Ulster Cycle ","title":"Ness (Irish mythology)"},{"id":"1426326","text":"Eochaid S√°lbuide (Eochaid Yellow-heel) was king of Ulster prior to the events of the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology.

They came mainly from northern Finland and northern Norway where they had been members of the state churches. Most or all members had ties from their home countries to the Laestadian revival movement named after Swedish state church administrator and pastor Lars Levi Laestadius of Pajala, Sweden. Eventually, there were too many arguments between this denomination and the other American Laestadians, and some of the followers of Laestadius were excluded from the sacrament of holy communion. Under the lead of Salomon Korteniemi, the excluded members formed a congregation of their own in December 1872, under the name the Salomon Korteniemi Lutheran Society. In 1879 this name was changed to the Finnish Apostolic Lutheran Congregation. As other congregations of Finns in Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, and Oregon were organized on the same basis, they came into fellowship with this body under the name the Finnish Apostolic Lutheran Church, or, as it is usually called, the Apostolic Lutheran Church. The ALCA Laestadians are called \\"Mickelsens\\" by other Laestadians, after 20th Century leader Reverend Andrew Mickelsen (1897-1983).https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75093116http://extoots.blogspot.fi/2008/08/sports- good-thing_05.html The organization is also referred to by members and non- members as the Federation. == Membership == In 2009, membership in the denomination was estimated to include 6,000 baptized members.LWF Statistics 2009 Its ministers are mostly lay preachers.A Brief Study of the Lutheran Churches in America It has sizable congregations in Michigan, Minnesota, Washington, New Hampshire and in various other countries, such as Canada and Finland. The national organization is governed by an elected board (the Central Board) which meets regularly at various locations across the United States and Canada, and individual member churches are governed by elected boards. The ALCA has no central headquarters facility. == Doctrine == Family tree of laestadianism in America. Includes defunct groups. The ALCA narrowly follows the doctrines and practices of Laestadianism. For example, it emphasizes the necessity of regeneration and the practical importance of absolution from sin. It follows the Laestadian-specific doctrine of the audible declaration of forgiveness of sins and encourages avoidance of worldliness and sin. Unlike the two larger branches of Laestadianism, the ALCA does not teach that it is the only true Laestadian group. Liturgically, the church accepts the creeds of the Evangelical Lutheran church. The majority of the written doctrine of the Apostolic Lutheran Church is based on Luther's Small Catechism, a collection of Martin Luther's teachings. == References == * Encyclopedia of American Religions, J.

He came from the Thuringian town of Altenburg in the Holy Roman Empire, where his father held the office of a burgrave of the immediate Pleissnerland, which however had long been pawned to the Saxon House of Wettin. Altenburg joined the Order in 1307 and served as Komtur of Ragnit (1320‚Äì24) and of Balga (1326‚Äì31). In 1331 he was appointed Grand Marshal of the Order, and resumed the Polish‚ÄìTeutonic War smouldering since 1326. After the Battle of P≈Çowce, the Order conquered the former Duchy of Kuyavia with Dobrzy≈Ñ Land from the Kingdom of Poland under W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high. Altenburg was accused before a papal tribunal of alleged crimes committed during the Kuyavian campaign. Nevertheless, the relations with Poland improved upon the accession of King Casimir III the Great in 1333 and the election of well-disposed Pope Benedict XII the next year. At the 1335 Congress of Visegr√°d, by the agency of King John of Bohemia, an agreement was made, whereafter the Polish king would renounce Pomerelia in favour of the Order and in turn regain Kuyavia and Dobrzy≈Ñ. The arrangement however met with protest by the Polish szlachta, and a final peace was not achieved until 1343 by the Treaty of Kalisz. After Altenburg was elected as Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, he set about building or reconstructing many of the Order's castles. He began the reconstruction of the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary at Marienburg, including the building of the main tower, and commissioned a mosaic figure of the Madonna. The Chapel of Saint Anne, the first permanent bridge over the Nogat, and the Bridge Gate were also completed during his time in office. Meanwhile, the conflict with Poland as well as the papal proceedings lingered on. Despite an intervention by the Emperor Louis IV, in 1339 the Roman Curia sentenced the Order to surrender all estates claimed by Poland, a judgement that however was not approved by the Pope. Intending to negotiate with Poland, in 1341 Altenburg traveled to Thorn (Toru≈Ñ), but died there from an illness in October of that year. He was the first Grand Master to be buried in the Chapel of Saint Anne in Marienburg; his original gravestone can still be seen there to this day. ==References== * Friedrich Borchert: \\"Die Hochmeister des Deutschen Ordens in Preu√üen.\\" In: Preu√üische Allgemeine Zeitung, 6 October 2001.

Unlike some other battle games or LARPs, there is no use of magic.\\"Healing Poems\\" are used, but effectively just as a respawn delay mechanism - their essential feature is they must be 180 syllables long ==Description== A fighter with self-made weapons and armor. Dagorhir is a full-contact, live-action combat game, and combatants engage each other in battle with foam-padded boffer weaponry and equipment. In order to keep battles organized, realistic, and safe, the three main tenets of The Dagorhir Manual of Arms - safety, playability, and realism - are enforced by heralds (referees) during battles. The rules of the manual of arms, as well as those pertaining to combat, are upheld by an effective honor system which applies to all players. Dagorhir is a battle gaming group which is more akin to a wargame than a live-action roleplaying game (LARP). Dagorhir members have stated that they find the phrase \\"live-action roleplaying game\\" to be unfitting. Though many members of the community would disagree with this assertion.Wreckreation Nation, \\"Demolition Derby\\", Discovery Channel, January 20, 2009 (This source is a limited opinion and not the views of the community at large.) All weapons and equipment used during combat are inspected for safety prior to each battle, to ensure that they comply with safety rules. Although early Dagorhir weapons were typically constructed from crude materials such as couch foam and broomsticks when the organization was in its infancy, modern-day weapons are usually made from combinations of both open and closed-cell foam bonded to a fiberglass or PVC pipe core. Participants may also elect to wear protective armor, which gives users an advantage in battle. Fighters are organized into units of various sizes, organized along social lines and that generally fight and socialize together and are a club or fraternity of sorts. Units typically adopt a particular historical or fantastical race or nationality and dress, act, and fight according to interpretation of the group. Due to this melding of both Medieval history and Tolkienesque high fantasy, it is not uncommon for a Dagorhir battle to involve both mundane and fantasy themes and personas. A typical Dagorhir battle might involve Roman Legionaries and Saxon warriors locked in a battle against Orcs and Undead. Dagorhir is strictly a weapon combat game, with no concept of \\"magic\\". Dagorhir also eschews the use of character classes in combat, instead allowing fighters to create and define their own styles of combat. Fighters are free to choose their types of armor, picks of garb, choices of weaponry, and styles of play. Dagorhir is a full contact game, shield rushing and bashing are common practices as seen here during A Clash of Kings 2 Realms and Chapters are organized by geography, and can range from between a handful of participants to several hundred. Typically a chapter will organize a battle weekly or monthly, with the various units participating, with occasional supplementary activities such as feasts, overnight camp-out battles, and even annual inter-chapter meetings. The largest annual Dagorhir gathering is known as Ragnarok. It is an annual Dagorhir tradition and in years of late, it has reached heights of nearly 2000 attendees during its week-long duration. The original chapter of Dagorhir, founded in 1977, is based in the Washington, D.C. area, and is known as \\"Dagorhir Aratari\\" after the founder's persona, Aratar. ==History== Bryan Wiese watched the movie Robin and Marian while reading The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. He had never heard of medieval reenactment, Live Action Role Playing Games or even Dungeons and Dragons but he wanted something to capture the spirit and adventure that could only come from wielding sword and bow. As 1977 rolled by, Bryan ran ads on the local radio station WGTB. Bryan then became \\"Aratar Anfinhir the Stormbringer\\" and Dagorhir was born into its first incarnation (as yet unnamed). The club grew and in 1980 a Washington D.C. community TV show PM Magazine ran a half-hour episode where the host of PM Magazine spent a day at a Dagorhir battle game. After that point interest in Dagorhir exploded in the D.C. Area. The explosive growth of Dagorhir took its toll on Bryan Wiese. Bryan, who had coined the game as ‚ÄúDagorhir Outdoor Improvisational Dark Age Battle Games‚Äù, had a more theatrical bend to his dream. The new flood of players had an attitude that was more sport like. In order to combat this change, the Dagorhir Handbook was formalized. This included costuming requirements in an effort to encourage the players to think of it more of a theatrical game. In the early eighties, a young man who went by the name of Falcon took the Dagorhir game to Cleveland, Ohio. Then in 1983, PM Magazine broadcast the TV episode to a national audience. The result was the founding of The Realm of Middle~Earth in Illinois. Dagorhir began to spread throughout the Mid Western U.S, and inspired spin off organizations, including Belegarth Medieval Combat Society. Dagorhir has enjoyed extensive nationwide growth in recent years, expanding to an international membership of over a hundred Chapters consisting of a total membership in the thousands. On January 20, 2009, the Discovery Channel show, Wreckreation Nation, featured Dagorhir in its episode, \\"Demolition Derby.\\" ==Membership== Dagorhir is open to the public, membership is free of charge (though larger events often have a nominal fee charged by the host to cover costs) and participation requires only a small start-up cost to obtain weapons and garb. Participants are generally members of chapters, called \\"realms,\\" which are formally registered in order to be allowed the use of the Dagorhir name, or related designs and documents. Most groups will keep an armory of weapons for loaning to new members or guests. This is most common of larger groups, but often smaller groups will do it as well. Sometimes veteran members will give old, unused weapons to the new players. As a project on the Dagorhir forums, people began counting and listing active Dagorhir members. At last count this list contained 1486 people with several large groups not reporting. Due to the nature of the chapters of Dagorhir, as well as the definitions of \\"active\\", this number cannot be completely accurate. It is usually required to have a release form signed and notarized before engaging in any activities. ==Major events== The largest national (inter-realm) Dagorhir event is Ragnarok. Attendance at Ragnarok from 2008-14 has averaged about 1,500, with the record being 1,627 at Ragnarok XXIX in June 2014. Ragnarok XXIII in June 2008 had more than 1,400 attendees, with over 650 actually fighting at the height of the event. Ragnarok XXIV, which took place in June 2009, attracted nearly 1,600 attendees. From 2001-9 Ragnarok was held at Spring Valley Campground in Cambridge, Ohio. However, after Ragnarok XXIV, the site of the event changed to Cooper's Lake Campground in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania. Attendance since Ragnarok XXIX has grown to around 2,000 participants. Groups across the nation hold events open to the public, and first-time fighters generally have their battle fee, if there is one, waived. While all local battles are open to any participant, there are battles such as a Crown War, that decide the \\"king\\" or \\"queen\\" of a realm. Then there are larger-scale regional events which typically draw over 100 fighters, as well as national events, of which Ragnarok remains the largest and longest running. In Fall 2006, the second major national event, named after the battle of Badon Hill, first took place in western Pennsylvania and drew over 350 attendees. Badon Hill now regularly has over 500 attendees, and the event was featured on an episode of the Discovery Channel's Wreckreation Nation. * January: ::Father Christmas Feast (Narnia) ‚Äî Saint Paul's Lutheran Church, West Falls, New York ::Battle for the Ring (Anduril Empire) ‚Äî Prado Regional Park, Chino, CA (held every MLK weekend) * February: ::Winter Invasion (Maethodoron) ‚Äî Blue Spruce Park, Indiana, Pennsylvania ::Coronation ‚Äî Unitarian Universalist Church of Utica, Utica, New York * March: ::Ides of March ‚Äî Eastwind Castle, Trenton, South Carolina (Formerly at: Dragon Hills Retreat, Bowdon, Georgia until 2018) * April: ::Olympics ‚Äî Indianapolis, Indiana ::Gates of Fire (Aratari, Gestiguiste) ‚Äî Pioneer Park Campground, Somerset, Pennsylvania ::Plains of the West ‚Äî James A Bible Park, Denver, Colorado * May: ::Beltaine - Dickson, Tennessee ::Mayhem - Upper Marlboro, Maryland ::Gates of Summer ‚Äî Stewarts Farm, Holden, Missouri * June: ::Ragnarok ‚Äî Coopers Lake Campground, Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania * July: ::Allthyng ‚Äî Upper Malboro, Maryland *August: ::Summer Slaughter - Doe Lake Campgrounds, Umatilla, Florida * September: ::Eclipse - Spring Valley Campground, Ohio ::Equinox - Dickson, Tennessee ::Battle of Badon Hill (Aratari, Rome) ‚Äî Pioneer Park Campground, Somerset, Pennsylvania ::War of the Iron Fist ‚Äî Stewarts Farm, Holden, Missouri * October: ::Here There be Dragons (Efoloma Isemoo) - Rockford, Illinois ::A Clash of Kings - Vanderkamp Center, Cleveland, New York * November: ::Winter War- Eastwind Castle - Trenton, South Carolina. ==See also== * Amtgard * Belegarth * Society for Creative Anachronism * Darkon ==References== ==External links== * Official Website * Ragnarok Official Website * Joining Dagorhir * A List of Dagorhir Groups * Dagorhir in the News Category:Live- action battle gaming Category:Live-action role-playing games Category:Role- playing games introduced in 1977 ","title":"Dagorhir"},{"id":"1426398","text":"Darwinia is a 1998 science fiction/alternate history novel by American- Canadian writer Robert Charles Wilson. Darwinia was written in segments, in Vancouver, Whitehorse (Yukon), and Toronto. == Plot summary == In March 1912, in the event some called the \\"Miracle\\", Europe and parts of Asia and Africa, including its inhabitants, disappear suddenly overnight and are replaced with a slice of an alien Earth, a land mass of roughly equal outlines and terrain features, but with a strange new flora and fauna which seems to have followed a different path in evolution. Seen by some as an act of divine retribution, the \\"Miracle\\" affects the lives of people all around and transforms world history. Having been \\"The New World\\" settled by Europeans, America now becomes involved in an effort to re-settle the strange new Europe. Lord Kitchener - who, with no World War I breaking out, lives on past 1916 - tries to hold together the remnants of the British Empire and re-settle Britain, though the refounded London is little more than \\"a raw frontier town\\". Against this background, the book describes the life and the adventures of Guilford Law, a young American photographer. As a 14-year-old boy, Guilford Law witnessed the \\"Miracle\\" as shimmering lights moving eerily across the ocean sky. As a grown man, he is determined to travel to the strange continent of Darwinia and explore its mysteries. To that end, he enlists as a photographer in the Finch expedition, which plans to travel up the river that used to be known as the Rhine and penetrate the bizarre new continent's hidden depths as far as possible. He lands in the middle of the jungle in the midst of nationalistic skirmishes, in which partisans attack and wipe out most of the party of the Finch expedition on the continent that they believe to belong to them. Law brought an unwanted companion with him, a mysterious twin who seems to have both lived and died on an alternate Earth unchanged by the Miracle. The twin first appears to Guilford in dreams, and he brings a message that Darwinia is not what it seems to be, and Guilford is not who he seems to be. A startling revelation soon arrives. By the end of the story, it is revealed to all the characters that it is really now the end of time and that the Universe, the Earth, and all the consciousness that ever existed are really being preserved in a computer-like simulation known as the Archive. The Archive was built by a coalition of all the sentient beings in the Universe in an effort to save consciousness from death. However, \\"viruses\\" (parasitic artificial life-forms) known as Psions have invaded the system of the Archive. Guilford Law eventually learns that he and those like him serve as instruments in a cosmic struggle against the Psions for the survival of consciousness itself. ==Reception== Darwinia won the Prix Aurora Award (Canadian science fiction and fantasy) for Best Long Form in 1999, and was nominated for the 1999 Hugo Award for Best Novel. John Clute considers the novel to follow the themes of Canadian literature, despite an opening which indicates that it would follow the themes of American literature; he has also criticized Wilson for \\"not (...) creat(ing) any single character capable either of understanding [the] story, or effecting it in his own person.\\"Excessive Candour: Reality is somewhere else, by John Clute, at Scifi.com (via archive.org); published January 29, 1999; retrieved March 15, 2017 ==See also== * October the First Is Too Late * Omega Point * Simulated reality * Simulated reality in fiction ==ReferencesDarwinia at Worlds Without End Category:1998 American novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Novels about virtual reality Category:American steampunk novels Category:Novels by Robert Charles Wilson Category:Tor Books books Category:Novels about the end of the universe Category:Cultural depictions of Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener ","title":"Darwinia (novel)"},{"id":"1426401","text":"Hyde Park Bank is the name for three banks and bank structures in the United States: * Hyde Park Co-operative Bank is a bank based in Hyde Park, Massachusetts. * Hyde Park-Kenwood National Bank Building is a landmarked building (1929) that houses a Chicago, Illinois bank. * Hyde Park Savings Bank is another bank based in Hyde Park, Massachusetts.

The related English adjective Hoabinhian (French hoabianien) has become a common term in the English-based literature to describe stone artifact assemblages in Southeast Asia that contain flaked, cobble artifacts, dated to c. 10,000-2000 BCE. The term was originally used to refer to a specific ethnic group, restricted to a limited period with a distinctive subsistence economy and technology. More recent work (e.g., Shoocongdej 2000) uses the term to refer to artifacts and assemblages with certain formal characteristics. Bacsonian is often regarded as a variation of the Hoabinhian industry characterized by a higher frequency of edge-grounded cobble artifacts compared to earlier Hoabinhian artifacts, dated to c. 8000-4000 BCE. == Pre-Hoabinian technology == H√† VƒÉn T·∫•n outlined in his paper his definition of a lithic technology that occurred before the Hoabinian. He found primitive flakes in stratigraphy below Hoabinian pebble tools across several sites in Southeast Asia which led him to name the flake technology, Nguomian ‚Äî named after a large assembly of flakes found at the Nguom rockshelter in the Bac Thai province in Vietnam.Van Tan H. (1997) The Hoabinhian and before. Bulletin of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association (Chiang Mai Papers, Volume 3) 16: 35-41 Hoabininhian technology is also claimed to be a continuation of the Sonvian technology. == History of definitions == In 1927 Madeleine Colani published some details of her nine excavations in the northern Vietnamese province of H√≤a B√¨nh. As a result of her work the First Congress of Prehistorians of the Far East in 1932 agreed to define the Hoabinhian as > a culture composed of implements that are in general flaked with somewhat > varied types of primitive workmanship. It is characterised by tools often > worked only on one face, by hammerstones, by implements of sub-triangular > section, by discs, short axes and almond shaped artefacts, with an > appreciable number of bone tools (Matthews 1966). Despite the general terms of the definition, Colani's Hoabinhian is an elaborate typology as indicated by the 82 artefacts from Sao Dong that Colani classified into 28 types (Matthews 1966). The original typology is so complicated that most Hoabinhian sites are identified simply by the presence of sumatraliths (White & Gorman 1979). The chronology of Hoabinhian artifacts was assumed to be Holocene because of the extant fauna found in the assemblages and the absence of extinct fauna by Colani and others working before the availability of radiocarbon dating methods in the 1950s. Problems with Colani's typology were exposed by Matthews (1964) who analysed metric and technological attributes of unifacially flaked cobble artifacts from Hoabinhian levels at Sai Yok Rockshelter, Kanchanaburi Province, west-central Thailand. His aim was to determine if Hoabinhian artefact types described by Colani could be defined as clusters of constantly recurring attributes such as length, width, thickness, mass, length-width ratio and cortex amount and distribution. Matthews found that Hoabinhian types did not exist and instead Hoabinhian artifacts reflect a continuous range of shapes and sizes. Following his archaeological excavation and surveys in Mae Hong Son Province, northwest Thailand, Chester Gorman (1970) proposed a more detailed definition as follows # A generally unifacial flaked tool tradition made primarily on water rounded pebbles and large flakes detached from these pebbles # Core tools (\\"Sumatraliths\\") made by complete flaking on one side of a pebble and grinding stones also made on rounded pebbles, usually in association with iron oxide # A high incidence of used flakes (identified from edge-damage characteristics) # Fairly similar assemblages of food remains including remains of extant shellfish, fish and small-to-medium-size mammals # A cultural and ecological orientation to the use of rockshelters generally occurring near freshwater streams in an upland karstic topography (though Hoabinhian shell middens do indicate at least one other ecological orientation) # Edge-grinding and cord- marked ceramics occurring, individually or together, in the upper layers of Hoabinhian deposits Gorman's work included a number of radiocarbon dates that confirmed the Holocene age of the Hoabinhian. Gorman's carbon-14 dates place Hoabinhian levels at spirit cave between 12,000 and 8000 BP, these levels have also produced cord-marked ceramics.Who Needs the Past?: Indigenous Values and Archaeology by Robert Layton, page 154 The term was redefined in 1994 by archaeologists attending a conference held in Hanoi. At this conference Vietnamese archaeologists presented evidence of Hoabinhian artifacts dating to 17,000 years before the present. A vote was held where it was agreed that # The concept of the Hoabinhian should be kept # The best concept for \\"Hoabinhian\\" was an industry rather than a culture or techno-complex # The chronology of the Hoabinhian industry dates is from \\"late-to-terminal Pleistocene to early-to-mid Holocene\\" # The term \\"Sumatralith\\" should be retained # The Hoabinhian Industry should be referred to as a \\"cobble\\" rather that a \\"pebble\\" tool industry # The Hoabinhian should not be referred to as a \\"Mesolithic\\" phenomenon == Geographical distribution == Since the term was first used to describe assemblages from sites in Vietnam, many sites throughout mainland and island Southeast Asia have been described as having Hoabinhian components. The apparent concentration of more than 120 Hoabinhian sites in Vietnam reflects intensive research activities in this area rather the location of a centre of the prehistoric Hoabinhian activity. The oldest Hoabinhian complex was discovered at Xiaodong, a large rockshelter in Yunnan, China, from the Burmese border. It is the only Hoabinhian site discovered in China. Archaeological sites in Terengganu, Sumatra, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia have been identified as Hoabinhian, although the quality and quantity of descriptions vary and the relative significance of the Hoabinhian component at these sites can be difficult to determine. Recent archaeological research indicates that variation in Hoabinhian artifacts across regions are largely influenced by local, region-specific proximity to resources and changes in environmental conditions. Beyond this core area, some archaeologists argue that there are isolated inventories of stone artifacts displaying Hoabinhian elements in Nepal, South China, Taiwan and Australia (Moser 2001). == The Hoabinhian and plant domestication == Gorman (1971) claimed that Spirit Cave included remains of Prunus (almond), Terminalia, Areca (betel), Vicia (broadbean) or Phaseolus, Pisum (pea) or Raphia Lagenaria (bottle gourd), Trapa (water caltrop), Piper (pepper), Madhuca (butternut), Canarium, Aleurites (candle nut), and Cucumis (a cucumber type) in layers dating to c. 9800-8500 BP. None of the recovered specimens differed from their wild phenotypes. He suggested that these may have been used as foods, condiments, stimulants, for lighting and that the leguminous plants in particular 'point to a very early use of domesticated plants' (Gorman 1969:672). He later wrote (1971:311) that 'Whether they are definitely early cultigens (see Yen n.d.:12) remains to be established... What is important, and what we can say definitely, is that the remains indicate the early, quite sophisticated use of particular species which are still culturally important in Southeast Asia.' In 1972 W. G. Solheim, as the director of the project of which Spirit Cave was part, published an article in Scientific American discussing the finds from Spirit Cave. While Solheim noted that the specimens may 'merely be wild species gathered from the surrounding countryside', he claimed that the inhabitants at Spirit Cave had 'an advanced knowledge of horticulture'. Solheim's chronological chart suggests that 'incipient agriculture' began at about 20,000 BC in southeast Asia. He also suggests that ceramic technology was invented at 13,000 BC although Spirit Cave does not have ceramics until after 6800 BC. Although Solheim concludes that his reconstruction is 'largely hypothetical', his overstatement of the results of Gorman's excavation has led to inflated claims of Hoabinhian agriculture. These claims have detracted from the significance of Spirit Cave as a site with well-preserved evidence of human subsistence and palaeoenvironmental conditions during the Hoabinhian. Viet (2004), however, focuses on mainly Hoabinhians in Viet Nam. Within his wide range of study of this area, Da But is a site he works on that is dated to about fifth to sixth millennium BC to the end of the third millennium BC. Within this site, Viet sees that the food Hoabinhians mostly focus on are mountainous shellfish, nuts, and fruit. Interesting enough, the site even shows a new shellfish species that they consumed: an as-yet-unnamed species of freshwater clam of Corbicula spp; species are known to live in swampy areas and lakes. The general food sources of Hoabinhians were gathered from the follow environmental conditions: * Limestone rock mountains (delivering land snails and some small mammals) * Mountain water sources like streams, small rivers, swamps and lakes (providing snails and fish) * Valley earthen surfaces (nuts, fruits, fungi, vegetables, wild cereals, and wild mammals) == Hoabinhian stone artefact technology == An experimental Hoabinhian assemblage was created and analyzed by Marwick (2008), which identified variables and methods that are the most useful in analyzing Hoabinhian assemblages. In particular he advocated for the use of a new method involving the dorsal cortex location of a flake. This method in particular was found to be especially useful in determining reduction intensity and may prove instrumental in answering broader archaeological questions involving subsistence, geographic range, and domestication. Based on Marwick's own research and Shoocongdej's (2000, 2006), behavioral ecological models were applied to examine human behavior through lithic assemblages which found in Tham Lod and Ban Rai rockshelters. In theory, high frequencies of pre- processing should reflect logistical mobility strategy. However, at Tham Lod, a high frequencies of pre-processing (CPM) but a residential mobility strategy (ODM) and a low intensity of occupation (PCM) was observed: We can see an internal conflict between models. An multiple optima model is proposed to explain this contradictory result. Multiple optima model allows more than one optimal scenario and is valid to explain high time-devoting lithic technology (i.e., pre-processing of lithic) and more residential mobility strategy in the same time. == References == ==Literature== *Colani M.

It was originally restricted to artist-engravers printing with oil-based inks in a press, distinct from the separate discipline of woodcuts. Today, its support extends to other forms of relief printmaking, and awards honorary membership to collectors and enthusiasts. ==History== The Society of Wood Engravers was founded on 27th March 1920 by a group of 10 artists who all wanted to promote wood engraving as a medium for modern artists. Unlike other societies of the time devoted to various aspects of relief printmaking, the SWE survived, successfully engaging up-coming generations, and celebrates its centenary in 2020. The liberation of wood engraving as a medium for artists was begun in the 1890s. Charles Ricketts and Charles Haslewood Shannon were the first in modern times to cut the blocks of their own designs or, more to the point, create their designs by the process of engraving them. This was well before the SWE was thought of. The foundation of the Society built on the development of this approach by a later generation of artists and in the Modernist era. Their names are listed below. Historically, white-line engraving on end-grain wood and black-line work on the plank side of the wood were both referred to as ‚Äòwoodcuts‚Äô. The habit of calling the first method ‚Äòwood engraving‚Äô, and the second ‚Äòwoodcut‚Äô, crystallised after World War II. The Society went into abeyance during the 1960s but was revived in 1984 by Hilary Paynter. The major regeneration of the SWE, virtually amounting to a re-foundation after a difficult mid-century, was built on the distinction between ‚Äòwood engraving‚Äô and ‚Äòwoodcut‚Äô: by then the more visible as the two traditions developed in different ways. Now that synthetic materials can be used for engraving on, it has been suggested that it is the fine engraving rather than the material engraved which really defines the medium; this is the quality many practitioners are drawn to and the reason for the continued growth of the Society. The SWE supports all kinds of relief printmaking but chiefly promotes fine wood engraving ‚Äì as its name implies. ==Founder Members== * Philip Hagreen * Lucien Pissarro * Robert Gibbings * E M O‚ÄôRourke Dickey * Sydney Lee * Noel Rooke * Edward Gordon Craig * Eric Gill * Gwen Raverat * John Nash ==Aims== The SWE was founded primarily to promote wood engraving in the European manner ‚Äì printing with oil-based inks in a press, rather than with water-based ink and manual pressure in the Japanese tradition. Secondly, its aim was to promote the work of artist-engravers as distinct from the nineteenth-century artisans, who engraved designs provided by artists but were not necessarily artists themselves. The artists Noel Rooke and Robert Gibbings, were the driving force behind the society. Joanna Selborne, ‚ÄòThe Society of Wood Engravers: the early years‚Äô in Craft History 1 (1988), published by Combined Arts. They determined to hold annual exhibitions of their work and to promote wood engraving through teaching. Current members remain committed to this ethos 100 years later. ==Annual Exhibition== Wood engraving has multiple applications in fine-art prints, in book illustration and in commerce. It attracts passionate practitioners who continue to develop experimental themes. The Society reflects these in its annual exhibitions. The Annual Exhibition is the largest and most important event in the SWE‚Äôs calendar, showing relief prints of all kinds, though wood engravings predominate. Submission to this exhibition is open to members and non-members alike. All entries go before a selection committee which includes the current Chairperson and two other elected Members of the Society. Initially restricted to London, the show now tours the UK visiting established galleries and those in remote areas where wood engraving may not have been seen before. ==Subscribers and Members== Subscription to the Society is by payment of an annual fee. The Society welcomes everyone, enthusiasts and collectors as well as artists: it has a worldwide following. In order to become a Member, the applicant must have exhibited wood engravings in the Annual Exhibition for three years, although these don‚Äôt need to run consecutively. Submission of an application form and portfolio of work will then be subject to scrutiny by the Member‚Äôs Selection Committee. All new members receive a copy of the Society‚Äôs constitution and may enter a third piece of work for the annual show in addition to the two allowed for non-members. The Society also recognizes non- engravers who work hard on its behalf by awarding them Honorary Membership. An AGM is held, usually in the Autumn, to which everyone is invited. Another social gathering held annually is the SWE Picnic which usually features an auction of prints and books. The Society has cordial relations with the Wood Engravers‚Äô Network (WEN), an American group with similar aims. ==Publications== The SWE publishes a monthly on-line Newsletter of up-coming events and a quarterly journal of record, information and discussion entitled ‚ÄòMultiples‚Äô. These are circulated to all subscribers and members and provide everyone with the chance to get to know each other and know about each other. Special occasion publications range from Christmas cards and broadsheets to limited edition boxed sets of engravings. ==Teaching== Imparting information and teaching wood engraving are strong components of the SWE's commitment. The Society is fortunate to have so many talented teachers in its midst who are willing to pass on their skills to others. Information about workshops is via the Newsletter. ==Funding== The SWE receives no outside funding and has thrived because a band of dedicated volunteers works tirelessly to ensure high quality and continuity. A bequest from earlier member William Rawlinson has enabled grants to students and funding for special projects. More recently, Rachel Reckitt has bequeathed annual prizes. ==Chair Persons== Since 1984 the committee has been chaired by the following people: * George Tute 1984 ‚Äì 1986 * Simon Brett ‚Äì 1986 ‚Äì 1992 * Ian Stephens ‚Äì 1992 ‚Äì 1995 * Sarah van Niekerk ‚Äì 1995 ‚Äì 1998 * Hilary Paynter ‚Äì 1998 ‚Äì 2006 * Peter Lawrence ‚Äì 2006 ‚Äì 2011 * Harry Brockway ‚Äì 2011 ‚Äì 2014 * Geri Waddington ‚Äì 2015 ‚Äì 2018 * Chris Daunt ‚Äì Current chair since 2018 ==Future of the SWE== The future of the Society looks bright with an increased number of subscribers and younger members. Our archive at the Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) preserves our past for the benefit of the next generation. Remaining visible in the 21st century is important; the Society has its own website where all the works from recent exhibitions may be viewed. Prints are available for sale via the website. Many members have their own individual websites to promote their work. Other social media accounts provide vital links between wood engravers in Britain and throughout the world. ==Other Former Members== * David Jones * Sydney Lee * Paul Nash * Iain Macnab * Gwenda Morgan * Hester Sainsbury * Leon Underwood ==References== ==External links== * *Artist Biographies: British and Irish Artists of the 20th Century Wood, Society Category:Woodworking Category:Art and design-related professional associations Category:Arts organisations based in the United Kingdom ","title":"Society of Wood Engravers"},{"id":"1426425","text":"In computing, a here document (here-document, here-text, heredoc, hereis, here-string or here-script) is a file literal or input stream literal: it is a section of a source code file that is treated as if it were a separate file. The term is also used for a form of multiline string literals that use similar syntax, preserving line breaks and other whitespace (including indentation) in the text. Here documents originate in the Unix shell, and are found in the Bourne shell (\`sh\`), C shell (\`csh\`), tcsh (\`tcsh\`), KornShell (\`ksh\`), Bash, and Z shell (\`zsh\`), among others. Here document-style string literals are found in various high-level languages, notably the Perl programming language (syntax inspired by Unix shell) and languages influenced by Perl, such as PHP and Ruby. Other high-level languages such as Python, JavaScript and Tcl have other facilities for multiline strings. Here documents can be treated either as files or strings. Some shells treat them as a format string literal, allowing variable substitution and command substitution inside the literal. The most common syntax for here documents, originating in Unix shells, is \`<<\` followed by a delimiting identifier (often the word EOF or END), followed, starting on the next line, by the text to be quoted, and then closed by the same delimiting identifier on its own line. This syntax is because here documents are formally stream literals, and the content of the document is redirected to stdin (standard input) of the preceding command; the here document syntax is by analogy with the syntax for input redirection, which is \`<\` ‚Äútake input from the following file‚Äù. Other languages often use substantially similar syntax, but details of syntax and actual functionality can vary significantly. When used simply for string literals, the \`<<\` does not indicate indirection, but is simply a starting delimiter convention. In some languages, such as Ruby, \`<<\` is also used for input redirection, thus resulting in \`<<\` being used twice if one wishes to redirect from a here document string literal. ==File literals== Narrowly speaking, here documents are file literals or stream literals. These originate in the Unix shell, though similar facilities are available in some other languages. ===Unix shells=== Here documents are available in many Unix shells. In the following example, text is passed to the \`tr\` command (transliterating lower to upper- case) using a here document. This could be in a shell file, or entered interactively at a prompt. $ LANG=C tr a-z A-Z << END_TEXT > one two three > four five six > END_TEXT ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX \`END_TEXT\` was used as the delimiting identifier. It specified the start and end of the here document. The redirect and the delimiting identifier do not need to be separated by a space: \`<<END_TEXT\` or \`<< END_TEXT\` both work equally well. By default, behavior is largely identical to the contents of double quotes: variable names are replaced by their values, commands within backticks are evaluated, etc. $ cat << EOF > \\\\$ Working dir \\"$PWD\\" \`pwd\` > EOF $ Working dir \\"/home/user\\" /home/user This can be disabled by quoting any part of the label, which is then ended by the unquoted value; the behavior is essentially identical to that if the contents were enclosed in single quotes. Thus for example by setting it in single quotes: $ cat << 'EOF' > \\\\$ Working dir \\"$PWD\\" \`pwd\` > EOF \\\\$ Working dir \\"$PWD\\" \`pwd\` Double quotes may also be used, but this is subject to confusion, because expansion does occur in a double-quoted string, but does not occur in a here document with double-quoted delimiter.See for example Using variables inside a bash heredoc Single- and double-quoted delimiters are distinguished in some other languages, notably Perl (see below), where behavior parallels the corresponding string quoting. In POSIX shell but not csh/tcsh, appending a minus sign to the << (i.e. \`<<-\`) has the effect that leading tabs are ignored.Darwin tcsh man page This allows indenting here documents in shell scripts (primarily for alignment with existing indentation) without changing their value: A script containing: LANG=C tr a-z A-Z <<\\\\- END_TEXT Here doc with <<\\\\- A single space character (i.e. 0x20 ) is at the beginning of this line This line begins with a single TAB character i.e 0x09 as does the next line END_TEXT echo The intended end was before this line echo and these were not processed by tr echo +++++++++++++++ LANG=C tr a-z A-Z << END_TEXT Here doc with << A single space character (i.e. 0x20 ) is at the beginning of this line This line begins with a single TAB character i.e 0x09 as does the next line END_TEXT echo The intended end was before this line, echo but because the line with the delimiting Identifier began with a TAB it was NOT recognized and echo the tr command continued processing. produces: HERE DOC WITH <<\\\\- A SINGLE SPACE CHARACTER (I.E. 0X20 ) IS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS LINE THIS LINE BEGINS WITH A SINGLE TAB CHARACTER I.E 0X09 AS DOES THE NEXT LINE The intended end was before this line and these were not processed by tr +++++++++++++++ HERE DOC WITH << A SINGLE SPACE CHARACTER (I.E. 0X20 ) IS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS LINE THIS LINE BEGINS WITH A SINGLE TAB CHARACTER I.E 0X09 AS DOES THE NEXT LINE END_TEXT ECHO THE INTENDED END WAS BEFORE THIS LINE, ECHO BUT BECAUSE THE LINE WITH THE DELIMITING IDENTIFIER BEGAN WITH A TAB IT WAS NOT RECOGNIZED AND ECHO THE TR COMMAND CONTINUED PROCESSING. Another use is to output to a file: cat << EOF > ~/testFile001 > 3 spaces precede this text. > A single tab character is at the beginning of this line. >Nothing precedes this text EOF ====Here strings==== A here string (available in bash, ksh, or zsh) is syntactically similar, consisting of \`<<<\`, and effects input redirection from a word (a sequence treated as a unit by the shell, in this context generally a string literal). In this case the usual shell syntax is used for the word (‚Äúhere string syntax‚Äù), with the only syntax being the redirection: a here string is an ordinary string used for input redirection, not a special kind of string. A single word need not be quoted: $ LANG=C tr a-z A-Z <<< one ONE In case of a string with spaces, it must be quoted: $ LANG=C tr a-z A-Z <<< 'one two three' ONE TWO THREE This could also be written as: $ foo='one two three' $ LANG=C tr a-z A-Z <<< \\"$foo\\" ONE TWO THREE Multiline strings are acceptable, yielding: $ LANG=C tr a-z A-Z <<< 'one > two three' ONE TWO THREE Note that leading and trailing newlines, if present, are included: $ LANG=C tr a-z A-Z <<< ' > one > two three > ' ONE TWO THREE $ The key difference from here documents is that, in here documents, the delimiters are on separate lines; the leading and trailing newlines are stripped. Unlike here documents, here strings do not use delimiters. Here strings are particularly useful for commands that often take short input, such as the calculator bc: $ bc <<< 2^10 1024 Note that here string behavior can also be accomplished (reversing the order) via piping and the \`echo\` command, as in: $ echo 'one two three'  LANG=C tr a-z A-Z ONE TWO THREE however here strings are particularly useful when the last command needs to run in the current process, as is the case with the \`read\` builtin: $ echo 'one two three'  read -r a b c $ echo \\"$a $b $c\\" yields nothing, while $ read -r a b c <<< 'one two three' $ echo \\"$a $b $c\\" one two three This happens because in the previous example piping causes \`read\` to run in a subprocess, and as such can not affect the environment of the parent process. ===Microsoft NMAKE=== In Microsoft NMAKE, here documents are referred to as inline files. Inline files are referenced as \`<<\` or \`<<pathname\`: the first notation creates a temporary file, the second notation creates (or overwrites) the file with the specified pathname. An inline file is terminated with \`<<\` on a line by itself, optionally followed by the (case- insensitive) keyword \`KEEP\` or \`NOKEEP\` to indicate whether the created file should be kept. target0: dependent0 command0 << temporary inline file ... << target1: dependent1 command1 << temporary, but preserved inline file ... < ===R=== R does not have file literals, but provides equivalent functionality by combining string literals with a string-to-file function. R allows arbitrary whitespace, including newlines, in strings. A string then can be turned into a file descriptor using the \`textConnection()\` function. For example, the following turns a data table embedded in the source code into a data-frame variable: str <\\\\- \\"State Population Income Illiteracy Life.Exp Murder HS.Grad Frost Alabama 3615 3624 2.1 69.05 15.1 41.3 20 Alaska 365 6315 1.5 69.31 11.3 66.7 152 Arizona 2212 4530 1.8 70.55 7.8 58.1 15 Arkansas 2110 3378 1.9 70.66 10.1 39.9 65\\" x <\\\\- read.table(textConnection(str), header=TRUE, row.names=1) ===Data segment=== Perlperldata: Special Literals and RubyRuby: Object: __END__ have a form of file literal, which can be considered a form of data segment. In these languages, including the line \`__DATA__\` (Perl) or \`__END__\` (Ruby, old Perl) marks the end of the code segment and the start of the data segment. Only the contents prior to this line are executed, and the contents of the source file after this line are available as a file object: \`PACKAGE::DATA\` in Perl (e.g., \`main::DATA\`) and \`DATA\` in Ruby. As an inline file, these are semantically similar to here documents, though there can be only one per script. However, in these languages the term \\"here document\\" instead refers to multiline string literals, as discussed below. ===Data URI Scheme=== As further explained in Data URI scheme, all major web browsers understand URIs that start with data: as here document. ==Multiline string literals== The term \\"here document\\" or \\"here string\\" is also used for multiline string literals in various programming languages, notably Perl (syntax influenced by Unix shell), and languages influenced by Perl, notably PHP and Ruby. The shell-style \`<<\` syntax is often retained, despite not being used for input redirection. ===Perl-influenced=== ====Perl==== In Perl there are several different ways to invoke here docs.Perl operators and precedence The delimiters around the tag have the same effect within the here doc as they would in a regular string literal: For example, using double quotes around the tag allows variables to be interpolated, but using single quotes doesn't, and using the tag without either behaves like double quotes. Using backticks as the delimiters around the tag runs the contents of the heredoc as a shell script. It is necessary to make sure that the end tag is at the beginning of the line or the tag will not be recognized by the interpreter. Note that the here doc does not start at the tag‚Äîbut rather starts on the next line. So the statement containing the tag continues on after the tag. Here is an example with double quotes: my $sender = \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\"; my $recipient = \\"Spike\\"; print <<\\"END\\"; Dear $recipient, I wish you to leave Sunnydale and never return. Not Quite Love, $sender END Output: Dear Spike, I wish you to leave Sunnydale and never return. Not Quite Love, Buffy the Vampire Slayer Here is an example with single quotes: print <<'END'; Dear $recipient, I wish you to leave Sunnydale and never return. Not Quite Love, $sender END Output: Dear $recipient, I wish you to leave Sunnydale and never return. Not Quite Love, $sender And an example with backticks (may not be portable): my $shell_script_stdout = <<\`END\`; echo foo echo bar END It is possible to start multiple heredocs on the same line: say(< The tag itself may contain whitespace, which may allow heredocs to be used without breaking indentation. say <<' END'; Hello World END Although since Perl version 5.26,https://perldoc.perl.org/perl5260delta.html#Indented-Here-documents heredocs can include indention: #prints \\"Hello there \\" with no leading whitespace. if (1) { print <<~EOF; Hello there EOF } In addition to these strings, Perl also features file literals, namely the contents of the file following \`__DATA__\` (formerly \`__END__\`) on a line by itself. This is accessible as the file object \`PACKAGE::DATA\` such as \`main::DATA\`, and can be viewed as a form of data segment. ====PHP==== In PHP, here documents are referred to as heredocs. In PHP heredocs are not string literals. Heredoc text behaves just like a double-quoted string, but without the double quotes. For example, meaning \`$\` will be parsed as a variable start, and \`\${\` or \`{$\` as a complex variable start. Outputs This is a heredoc section. For more information talk to Joe Smith, your local Programmer. Thanks! Hey Joe Smith! You can actually assign the heredoc section to a variable! The line containing the closing identifier must not contain any other characters, except an optional ending semicolon. Otherwise, it will not be considered to be a closing identifier, and PHP will continue looking for one. If a proper closing identifier is not found, a parse error will result at the last line of the script.Heredoc in PHP manual In PHP 5.3 and later, like Perl, it is possible to not interpolate variables by surrounding the tag with single quotes; this is called a nowdoc:http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.nowdoc $x = <<<'END' Dear $recipient, I wish you to leave Sunnydale and never return. Not Quite Love, $sender END; In PHP 5.3+ it is also possible to surround the tag with double quotes, which like Perl has the same effect as not surrounding the tag with anything at all. ====Ruby==== The following Ruby code displays a grocery list by using a here document. puts < The result: $ ruby grocery- list.rb Grocery list \\\\------------ 1\\\\. Salad mix. 2\\\\. Strawberries.* 3\\\\. Cereal. 4\\\\. Milk.* * Organic The \`<<\` in a here document does not indicate input redirection, but Ruby also uses \`<<\` for input redirection, so redirecting to a file from a here document involves using \`<<\` twice, in different senses: File::open(\\"grocery-list\\", \\"w\\") do f f << < As with Unix shells, Ruby also allows for the delimiting identifier not to start on the first column of a line, if the start of the here document is marked with the slightly different starter \`<<-\`. Besides, Ruby treats here documents as a double-quoted string, and as such, it is possible to use the \`#{}\` construct to interpolate code. The following example illustrates both of these features: now = Time.now puts <<-EOF It's #{now.hour} o'clock John, where are your kids? EOF Ruby expands on this by providing the \\"<<~\\" syntax for omitting indentation on the here document: puts <<~EOF This line is indented two spaces. This line is indented four spaces. This line is indented six spaces. EOF The common indentation of two spaces is omitted from all lines: $ ruby indented-heredoc.rb This line is indented two spaces. This line is indented four spaces. This line is indented six spaces. Like Perl, Ruby allows for starting multiple here documents in one line: puts < \\" + < And now it is over!\\" As with Perl, Ruby features file literals, namely the contents of the file following \`__END__\` on a line by itself. This is accessible as the file object \`DATA\` and can be viewed as a form of data segment. ===Python=== Python supports multi-line strings as a \\"verbatim\\" string. print(\\"\\"\\" Customer: Not much of a cheese shop is it? Shopkeeper: Finest in the district , sir. \\"\\"\\") From Python 3.6 onwards, verbatim f-strings support variable and expression interpolation. shop_type = \\"CHEESE\\" accolade = \\"finest\\" print(f\\"\\"\\" Customer: Not much of a {shop_type.lower()} shop is it? Shopkeeper: {accolade.capitalize()} in the district , sir. \\"\\"\\") ===D=== Since version 2.0, D has support for here document-style strings using the 'q' prefix character. These strings begin with \`q\\"IDENT\` followed immediately by a newline (for an arbitrary identifier IDENT), and end with \`IDENT\\"\` at the start of a line. int main() { string list = q\\"IDENT 1\\\\. Item One 2\\\\. Item Two 3\\\\. Item Three IDENT\\"; writef( list ); } D also supports a few quoting delimiters, with similar syntax, with such strings starting with \`q\\"[\` and ending with \`]\\"\` or similarly for other delimiter character (any of () <> {} or []). ===OS/JCL=== On IBM's Job Control Language (JCL) used on its earlier MVS and current z/OS operating systems, data which is inline to a job stream can be identified by an * on a DD statement, such as or In the first case, the lines of text follow and are combined into a pseudo file with the DD name SYSIN. All records following the command are combined until either another OS/JCL command occurs (any line beginning with ), the default EOF sequence () is found, or the physical end of data occurs. In the second case, the conditions are the same, except the DLM= operand is used to specify the text string signalling end of data, which can be used if a data stream contains JCL (again, any line beginning with ), or the sequence (such as comments in C or C++ source code). The following compiles and executes an assembly language program, supplied as in-line data to the assembler. //AHAR JOB ('ALEX HARRIS') // EXEC ASMLG //SYSIN DD * APROG START XR 15,15 BR 14 END /* //* JOB ENDS The statement is the functional equivalent of Indicating s stream of data follows, terminated by . ===Racket=== Racket's here strings start with \`#<<\` followed by characters that define a terminator for the string.Here string in Racket Documentation The content of the string includes all characters between the \`#<<\` line and a line whose only content is the specified terminator. More precisely, the content of the string starts after a newline following \`#<<\`, and it ends before a newline that is followed by the terminator. #lang racket (displayln #< Outputs: This is a simple here string in Racket. * One * Two * Three No escape sequences are recognized between the starting and terminating lines; all characters are included in the string (and terminator) literally. #lang racket (displayln #< Outputs: This string spans for multiple lines and can contain any Unicode symbol. So things like Œª, ‚ò†, Œ±, Œ≤, are all fine. In the next line comes the terminator. It can contain any Unicode symbol as well, even spaces and smileys! Here strings can be used normally in contexts where normal strings would: #lang racket (printf #< Outputs: Dear Isaac, Thanks for the insightful conversation yesterday. Carl An interesting alternative is to use the language extension \`at-exp\` to write @-expressions.@ Syntax in Racket Documentation They look like this: #lang at- exp racket (displayln @string-append{ This is a long string, very convenient when a long chunk of text is needed.

It's also okay to have Œª, Œ≥, Œ∏, ... Embed code: 7 An @-expression is not specific nor restricted to strings, it is a syntax form that can be composed with the rest of the language. ===Windows PowerShell=== In Windows PowerShell, here documents are referred to as here-strings. A here-string is a string which starts with an open delimiter (\`@\\"\` or \`@'\`) and ends with a close delimiter (\`\\"@\` or \`'@\`) on a line by itself, which terminates the string. All characters between the open and close delimiter are considered the string literal. Using a here-string with double quotes allows variables to be interpreted, using single quotes doesn't. Variable interpolation occurs with simple variables (e.g. \`$x\` but NOT \`$x.y\` or \`$x[0]\`). You can execute a set of statements by putting them in \`$()\` (e.g. \`$($x.y)\` or \`$(Get-Process  Out-String)\`). In the following PowerShell code, text is passed to a function using a here-string. The function \`ConvertTo-UpperCase\` is defined as follows: PS > function ConvertTo-UpperCase($string) { $string.ToUpper() } PS > ConvertTo-UpperCase @' >> one two three >> eins zwei drei >> '@ ONE TWO THREE EINS ZWEI DREI Here is an example that demonstrates variable interpolation and statement execution using a here-string with double quotes: PS > $doc, $marty = 'Dr. Emmett Brown', 'Marty McFly' PS > $time = [DateTime]'Friday, October 25, 1985 8:00:00 AM' PS > $diff = New-TimeSpan -Minutes 25 PS > @\\" >> $doc : Are those my clocks I hear? >> $marty : Yeah! Uh, it's $($time.Hour) o'clock! >> $doc : Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly $($diff.Minutes) minutes slow. >> $marty : Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Doc... Are you telling me that it's $(($time + $diff).ToShortTimeString())? >> $doc : Precisely. >> $marty : Damn! I'm late for school! >> \\"@ Dr. Emmett Brown : Are those my clocks I hear? Marty McFly : Yeah! Uh, it's 8 o'clock! Dr. Emmett Brown : Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly 25 minutes slow. Marty McFly : Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Doc... Are you telling me that it's 08:25? Dr. Emmett Brown : Precisely. Marty McFly : Damn! I'm late for school! Using a here-string with single quotes instead, the output would look like this: Output: PS > @' >> $doc : Are those my clocks I hear? >> $marty : Yeah! Uh, it's $($time.Hour) o'clock! >> $doc : Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly $($diff.Minutes) minutes slow. >> $marty : Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Doc... Are you telling me that it's $(($time + $diff).ToShortTimeString())? >> $doc : Precisely. >> $marty : Damn! I'm late for school! >> '@ $doc : Are those my clocks I hear? $marty : Yeah! Uh, it's $($time.Hour) o'clock! $doc : Perfect! My experiment worked! They're all exactly $($diff.Minutes) minutes slow. $marty : Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Doc... Are you telling me that it's $(($time + $diff).ToShortTimeString())? $doc : Precisely. $marty : Damn! I'm late for school! ===DIGITAL Command Language (DCL)=== In DCL scripts, any input line which does not begin with a $ symbol is implicitly treated as input to the preceding command - all lines which do not begin with $ are here-documents. The input is either passed to the program, or can be explicitly referenced by the logical name SYS$INPUT (analogous to the Unix concept of stdin). For instance, explicitly referencing the input as SYS$INPUT: $ TYPE SYS$INPUT This text will be directly echoed to the screen by the TYPE command. $! other commands ... produces: This text will be directly echoed to the screen by the TYPE command. Additionally, the DECK command, initially intended for punched card support (hence its name: it signified the beginning of a data deck) can be used to supply input to the preceding command.http://h71000.www7.hp.com/doc/83final/9996/9996pro_45.html The input deck is ended either by the command $ EOD, or the character pattern specified by the /DOLLARS parameter to DECK. Example of a program totalling up monetary values: $ RUN ADD_SUMS.EXE $ DECK $13.53 $3.33 $2.33 $ EOD Would produce the following output (presuming ADD_SUMS was written to read the values and add them): $19.19 Example of using DECK /DOLLARS to create one command file from another: $ COPY SYS$INPUT SYS$SCRATCH:TEMP.COM $ DECK /DOLLARS=$$$$ $ TYPE SYS$INPUT This is an example of using DECK to create a command file from within a command file $$$$ $! other commands follow ... ===YAML=== YAML primarily relies on whitespace indentation for structure, making it resistant to delimiter collision and capable representing multi-line strings with folded string literals: \\\\--- caption: \\"Example of heredoc-style functionality using YAML\\" date: \\"2007-06-01\\" example: > HTML goes into YAML without modification message:  > \\"Three is always greater than two, even for large values of two\\" > > \\\\--Author Unknown ==See also== *Pipeline (Unix) ==References== ===General=== * Bash Reference Manual ** 3.6.6 Here Documents ** 3.6.7 Here Strings * Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide, Mendel Cooper ** Chapter 19.

Gerry was its first president. It opened for business on June 17, 1871. It was originally located in the selectmen's room of the Hyde Park town hall. On September 1, 1871 it moved to Hyde Park's Neponset Block, where it remained until the building was destroyed by fire on May 5, 1874. The bank relocated temporarily to the town office building in the Everett Block. A new bank building was constructed in 1875. In 1899, the bank moved to a new building in Everett Square. The Panic of 1873 and the Long Depression led the Massachusetts State Bank Commission to place the bank under the restrictions of the \\"Stay Law of 1878\\", which allowed the commissioners to limit the time and amount of payments to depositors whenever they deemed it necessary. On June 15, 1880, the bank was allowed to resume normal business. In November 2011, the bank changed its name to Blue Hills Bank and made management changes as part of its effort to expand its consumer business and launch a commercial banking line. In December 2013, the bank secured the naming rights to the Blue Hills Bank Pavilion, an outdoor music venue on the Boston waterfront. On January 18, 2014, the bank acquired Nantucket Bank's 3 branches from Sovereign Bank. On July 21, 2014, the bank became a public company via an initial public offering.

He developed an interest in firearms at an early age, and he designed his first rifle‚Äîa breech loading rifle firing cardboard cartridges‚Äîin 1838, but this was turned down by the armed forces at the time. The logic was that a rifle capable of firing 13 shots a minute would be impossible to supply with enough ammunition. In the 1870s he stepped down from the daily running of his workshop to develop his newly invented bolt action rifle. This rifle, the Jarmann, was adopted by the Norwegian Army in 1884. The weapon was produced at the Kongsberg Weapon Factory (Kongsberg V√•penfabrikk). Jarmann was appointed a Knight of the Order of St. Olav and made a member of the Order of Vasa. He died in 1894, the same year his rifle was phased out of the service and replaced with the Krag-J√∏rgensen. After the Jarmann rifle was phased out of military use, some of the weapons were converted for use as the Jarmann harpoon rifle. ==References== ==Other sources== *Hanevik, Karl Egil (1998) Norske milit√¶rgev√¶rer etter 1867 (Hanevik v√•pen) *Hanevik, Karl Egil Kongsberg-Colten (Hanevik v√•pen) ==Related reading== *Flatnes, Oyvind (2014) From Musket to Metallic Cartridge (Crowood Press) ==External links== *The Jarmann rifle - Part 1 - Background history *The Jarmann rifle - Part 2 - Shooting Category:1816 births Category:1894 deaths Category:People from Nord- Fron Category:Firearm designers Category:Norwegian designers Category:Norwegian inventors Category:Recipients of the Order of Vasa Category:Recipients of the St. Olav's Medal ","title":"Jacob Smith Jarmann"},{"id":"1426469","text":"Lawrence Roger Fast (born December 10, 1951) is an American synthesizer player and composer. He is best known for his 1975‚Äì1987 series of synthesizer music albums (Synergy) and for his contributions to a number of popular music acts, including Peter Gabriel, Foreigner, Nektar, and Hall & Oates. == Biography == Fast grew up in Livingston, New Jersey and attended Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, where he obtained a degree in History. There he took his previous training in piano and violin and melded them with computer science to become interested in synthesized music and to build his own primitive sound- making electronic devices. He was introduced to Rick Wakeman, the keyboard player from the band Yes, during a local radio interview, and traveled to the UK to work with Yes on their 1974 album Tales from Topographic Oceans. It was there that he got a recording contract with Passport Records. == The Synergy project == Fast recorded a series of pioneering synthesizer music albums under the project name Synergy. The first album in the series, Electronic Realizations for Rock Orchestra, was released as an LP in 1975. Like the following albums in the series, it exclusively made use of synthesizers and electronic instruments. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Fast released eight more Synergy LPs on Passport Records, all of which were later re-released on CDs. The 1998 remastered re-release of Semi-Conductor, a compilation album originally released in 1984, contained ten additional tracks. The eleventh album in the series, Reconstructed Artifacts, was released in 2003; it contained completely new performances of select compositions from the previous albums, using modern digital synthesizers as well as new digital recording technologies. At least two tracks from the album Audion (1981) were used as the basis for music in Commodore 64 computer games: Rob Hubbard's scores for the C64 version of Zoids and Master of Magic, which were unofficial partial- covers of songs Ancestors and Shibolet. Synergy's first album states \\"..and nobody played guitar.\\" The second album, Sequencer, says \\"...and still no guitars.\\" These are rumored to be a tongue-in-cheek response to statements that appeared on albums by the rock group Queen that they used no synthesizers, which were made to inform listeners who assumed otherwise. Fast's third Synergy album, Cords, states \\"Finally, guitars...sort of,\\" which references the use of a Russ Hamm Guitar Synthesizer played by Pete Sobel. In August 2013, after several years of no releases, \\"Tower Indigo\\" was released on the Projekt Records compilation Possibilities of Circumstance. The Synergy albums are: * 1975: Electronic Realizations for Rock Orchestra No 66 Billboard 200 (18 weeks) * 1976: Sequencer No 144 Billboard 200 (11 weeks) * 1978: Cords No 146 Billboard 200 (6 weeks) * 1979: Games * 1981: Audion * 1981: Computer Experiments, Volume One * 1982: The Jupiter Menace (soundtrack for film The Jupiter Menace) * 1984: Semi-Conductor (compilation containing two new tracks) * 1987: Metropolitan Suite * 1998: Semi-Conductor, Release 2 (re-release of Semi-Conductor, remastered and containing ten additional tracks) * 2003: Reconstructed Artifacts (compilation consisting of re-recorded versions of old tracks) Fast has been developing a new Synergy album. This will be his first studio album of new material in over twenty years. According to Fast's website, it will use primarily software synthesizers (one of which is, fittingly, Sample Logic's Synergy synthesizer) rather than the hardware he had been using. He has amassed new thematic material for the album and also plans to rework old and unreleased pieces. == Other music projects == In addition to the Synergy albums, Fast made contributions to musical projects headed by other people: * Worked sporadically with Nektar, providing much of the dominating synthesizers on their 1975 album Recycled. * Also known for his work with Peter Gabriel. He played synthesizer on records and on tour, and rounded out the production team on Gabriel's albums from 1976 to 1986. He recorded parts for So, but these were not used. * Contributed to the 1977 concept album Intergalactic Touring Band on Passport Records. * Played the Prophet Synthesizer on Kate Bush's 1980 Album Never for Ever * Produced Canadian progressive rock group FM's 1980 album City of Fear. * Contributed music to the Carl Sagan 1980 television program Cosmos: A Personal Voyage. * Provided additional synthesizers on Foreigner's 1981 album 4 and Foreigner's 1984 album Agent Provocateur. * Played synthesizers on the 1983 Bonnie Tyler single \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\". * Collaborated on the 1980s pop music project Iam Siam, which produced the hit \\"She Went Pop\\". * Produced and performed synthesizer on Annie Haslam's 1989 release Annie Haslam. * Along with David Bryan composed, arranged, and performed the score music to the 1992 film Netherworld. * Helped create the music for Tokyo DisneySea, a new Walt Disney theme park. * Toured and recorded with bassist Tony Levin (himself an alumnus of Peter Gabriel's band) as part of Levin's Waters of Eden band. * Toured with the Tony Levin Band in 2006. == Other interests == Fast has done some work with designing listening devices for the hearing disabled; his wife had been working in the field for some time. Fast owns several patents for audio distribution using infrared optical technologies. Fast is also part of a government group aiming to protect some of New Jersey's historic assets against developers. == References == == External links == * Larry Fast's official homepage, containing his biography and discography. * * * Larry Fast biography on artistdirect.com * 2009 Interview with Larry Fast on Planet Origo * 2004 Interview with Larry Fast on innerviews * 1997 Larry Fast interview at electronicmusic.com *Larry Fast Interview - NAMM Oral History Library (2009) Category:1951 births Category:American electronic musicians Category:American Hi-NRG musicians Category:American male composers Category:21st-century American composers Category:Peter Gabriel Category:New-age musicians Category:Lafayette College alumni Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Newark, New Jersey Category:People from Livingston, New Jersey ","title":"Larry Fast"},{"id":"1426476","text":"McLaren Vale is a wine region in the Australian state of South Australia located in the Adelaide metropolitan area and centred on the town of McLaren Vale about south of the Adelaide city centre. It is internationally renowned for the wines it produces and included within the Great Wine Capitals of the World. The region was named after either David McLaren, the Colonial Manager of the South Australia Company or John McLaren (unrelated) who surveyed the area in 1839. Among the first settlers to the region in late 1839, were two English farmers from Devon, William Colton and Charles Thomas Hewett. William Colton established the Daringa Farm and Charles Thomas Hewett established Oxenberry Farm. Both men would be prominent in the early days of McLaren Vale. Although initially the region's main economic activity was the growing of cereal crops, John Reynell and Thomas Hardy planted grape vines in 1838 and the present-day Seaview and Hardy wineries were in operation as early as 1850. Grapes were first planted in the region in 1838 and some vines more than 100 years old are still producing. Today there are more than 88 cellar doors in McLaren Vale. The majority are small family-run operations and boutique wineries. ==Geography== The wine region which is located within the southern end of the Adelaide metropolitan area is bounded by the coastline with Gulf St Vincent in the west and by the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges in the east and in the south with its northern boundary commencing at the coastline in the suburb of Hallett Cove and finishing in the foothills in the suburb of Chandlers Hill. It is located mainly within the local government area of the City of Onkaparinga with part of its northern end being in the local government area of the City of Marion. ==Climate== The McLaren Vale wine region has a Mediterranean climate with four clear seasons. With a dry warm summer, the area has dry weather from December through to March or April, giving an easy change between summer and winter. It is gentle with long warm days and short cool nights. Winter rains of 580‚Äì700 mm per annum flow into a fresh spring. It rarely experiences frost or drought due to its close proximity to the sea. ==Wines== McLaren Vale vineyard The McLaren Vale wine region is well known for its dry red wines, especially those made from Shiraz, Grenache and Mourvedre. Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo and Sangiovese are also grown. White wine varieties in the wine region include Fiano, Vermentino, Grenache blanc, Roussanne and other such Mediterranean varieties. Notable for producing Shiraz, the grape is by far the most important variety for the wine region, accounting for about 50% of the total crush. The area's thin soils, limited water and warm summers harness Shiraz's natural vigor and produce intense flavored fruit, and wine with a deep purple color that can last decades in the bottle. McLaren Vale wines are distinguished by their ripeness, elegance, structure, power and complexity. The wine region has 3218 hectares of Shiraz under vine. Other major varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon with 1288 ha planted, Chardonnay with 722 ha planted, and Grenache with 402 ha‚Äîmuch of this dry-grown (non-irrigated) bush vines. (Statistics taken from the Phylloxera and Grape Industry Board's vineyard register as of May 2005.) * Shiraz is harvested from late February to early April. McLaren Vale Shiraz displays pronounced berry and spice characters with some dark chocolate and liquorice, while Shiraz from cooler sub-regions exhibits defined ripe raspberry characters. McLaren Vale Shiraz is renowned for its great softness and rolling palate. Many winemakers within the wine region choose to blend their final Shiraz from a variety of sub-regions to add complexity. The wine region naturally produces Shiraz that has very small berries. Smaller berries have a higher skin to pulp ratio. Berry skin contains flavanols (Anti-sunburn in grapes, 'flavour' in wine), Anthocyanins (colour) and other complex molecules that add to wine complexity. Grape pulp contains sugar and water. Therefore, the more skin to less pulp the more complex the finished wine. Small berries make more intense Shiraz wine. The wine region has a diversity of soil types, clones and winemaking philosophies, which has led to a huge range of Shiraz wine styles being produced. Most winemakers produce at least one Shiraz wine * Cabernet Sauvignon is harvested in late March. Less famous than McLaren Vale Shiraz, but equally enchanting, Cabernet Sauvignon from the wine region continues to display the rich ripe characters that typify wines from this region. Violet and blackcurrant flavours, vibrant plum, mint and edges of liquorice and a touch of the wine regions trademark dark chocolate character are common. * Grenache is harvested in late April. It is the ancient type of vine widely planted in France and Spain. It is the backbone of many of the world's red and fortified wines. Grenache vines were removed from the wine region in the 1980s when demand for fortified wines fell. Since the late 1990s Grenache has been enjoying a resurgence of popularity as table wine. The wine region's soils are particularly suited to this variety. However, in wet years it can be difficult to grow well as it can produce big bunches of grapes which make a less concentrated wine. In the best vintages Grenache displays nuances of plum, mulberry and tobacco leaf, spice and mint characters with earthy overtones. * Chardonnay is harvested in mid March. This is the major white variety in the wine region. The most pronounced and distinctive feature is ripe peaches, with the wine from cooler sites displaying white peach. These wines maintain elegance and generally have long cellaring potential. Some McLaren Vale Chardonnay also features ripe melon, banana, fig and cashew nut flavours‚Äîrich and generous with pure elegance. * Sauvignon blanc is harvested in early March. Sauvignon blanc from McLaren Vale has distinctive varietal characters of tropical fruit, green olives and asparagus, and a full-flavored palate with a clean, fresh acid finish. Sauvignon blanc grown in the wine region reaches relatively high sugar levels compared with other wine regions growing this variety. The variety shows herbaceous, gooseberry, passion fruit and lychee aromas. * Petit Verdot is one of Bordeaux's classic red grape varieties. It is a very thick-skinned grape that produces a wine of considerable depth, peppery, spicy and fragrant. Geoff Johnston of Pirramimma planted the first Australian plot at McLaren Vale in 1983 and it is only now that this wine is being recognized elsewhere. Demand for cuttings of this variety has expanded rapidly and more wines will be presented to the market in the future. Petit Verdot grapes produce wine that has the color intensity and spice of Shiraz, but with added fragrance of violets, which makes the nose very attractive. * Sangiovese is an Italian variety that does well in low fertility soils and a warm dry climate. It is slow to ripen and produces wine high in acid and tannin. The wine is deep in colour and aroma, and good for long cellaring. Sangiovese is harvested in the wine region from late March to early April. * Tempranillo is a Spanish variety that produces a red wine that matures quickly and can be ready for drinking in the year of vintage. In Spain Tempranillo is one of the most popular reds and when blended with Carignan it makes the best red wine of the Rioja region. * Verdelho is a Portuguese white wine variety that likes low vigour soils and a warm dry climate, Verdelho has been around for some time and is enjoying an increase in popularity. It produces wines that are vivacious, fruit salad-like, dry, and best when drunk young and fresh. * Viognier is an exotic variety introduced from France where the best wines are produced in the Condrieu region. This variety exhibits exotic aromas of apricot and musk, and light oak and malolactic character; with rose, nectarine and white peach, McLaren Vale Viognier is spicy and complex with a huge spectrum of flavours. * Zinfandel is a thin-skinned grape that needs dry conditions to avoid rotting. Bunches ripen unevenly, requiring careful picking to ensure the true character is available to be further developed by the winemaker. Zinfandel is spicy in character without being particularly heavy. ==Soil characteristics== The McLaren Vale wine region has many different soil types and this contributes to the wines from the area having different terroir. The vineyards are planted on soils including fertile red-brown earths, terra rossa, rendzina, soft sands and dark cracking clays. Each of these soil types contributes to the rich diversity of wine produced by the winemakers of the wine region. Overall the soils have one common trait; they are free draining which means they hold very little water. This is, in fact, an advantage, as it allows the accurate control of moisture to the vines through the use of state-of-the-art drip irrigation. Because of reliable winter rain, irrigation can be kept to low levels and manipulated to achieve the production of superior fruit. Some soil types allow grapes to be dry- grown. Approximately 20% of the total crop is dry-grown. These dry-grown vines are renowned for small fruit size, which is sought after for the intensity of its flavour. Most vineyards are found on gently undulating land at about 100m above sea level. In the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges to the east, where there is a scattering of vineyards, elevation rises to 320 m. At Blewitt Springs elevation is around 200 m. These variations in elevation have a significant impact on the terroir and fruit produced in the vineyards. ==Subregions== The McLaren Vale wine region has no recognised subregions, however, some wineries promote their vineyards as being in particular subregions with terroir peculiar to that part of the region. The McLaren Vale Grape Wine and Tourism Association has identified 19 distinct districts based on climate and geology. ==Statutory protection of parts of the wine region== In February 2011, South Australian Premier Mike Rann announced that the state government would \\"look at ways that we can protect the unique identity and integrity of the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale.\\" Premier Rann said: \\"Barossa and McLaren Vale food and wine are key icons of South Australia. We must never allow the Barossa or McLaren Vale to become suburbs of Adelaide (sic).\\" Legislation to protect the character of the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale was reported in the media as being passed by the South Australian Parliament in 2012 and came into force in January 2013. The statutory change consisted of an amendment to an existing item of legislation, the Development Act 1993, to create protection districts (also called Character Preservation Districts) within the relevant local government areas to replace the interim protection districts put in place on 11 April 2012. The intention of the amendment is to ensure that the requirements for a protection district will always prevail over other development requirements where there is conflict. In the case of the McLaren Vale wine region, a character protection district with the name McLaren Vale District was created within the boundaries of the City of Onkaparinga. The character protection district overlays a majority of the land within the local government area. Specifically, this is land not zoned for residential and other urban uses and consists mainly of the eastern side of the local government area extending from the Sturt Creek in the north to parts of the coastal suburbs of Aldinga, Aldinga Beach, Maslin Beach, Port Willunga and Sellicks Beach in the south. ==See also== * Australian wine * Fleurieu zone (wine) * List of wineries in McLaren Vale * South Australian wine ==References== == External links == *McLaren Vale Grape Wine & Tourism Association Inc. webpage Category:Adelaide Category:Wine regions of South Australia ","title":"McLaren Vale"},{"id":"1426477","text":"Princess Anna Alojza Ostrogska (1600-1654) was a Polish‚ÄìLithuanian noblewoman and heiress, known for her great fortune, and famously pious and ascetic lifestyle.

Officially opened in April 2007, it replaced the High Flux Australian Reactor as Australia's only nuclear reactor, and is located at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) Research Establishment in Lucas Heights, New South Wales, a suburb of Sydney. Both OPAL and its predecessor have been commonly known as simply the Lucas Heights reactor, after their location. ==Functions== The main reactor uses are: * Irradiation of target materials to produce radioisotopes for medical and industrial applications * Research in the fields of materials science and structural biology using neutron beams and its sophisticated suite of experimental equipment * Analysis of minerals and samples using the neutron activation technique and the delay neutron activation technique * Irradiation of silicon ingots in order to dope them with phosphorus and produce the basic material used in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices The reactor runs on an operation cycle of 30 days non-stop at full power, followed by a stop of 5 days to reshuffle the fuel. During year 2014 OPAL ran a total of 290 days at power, and over 300 days in 2015. ==History== The Argentine company INVAP was fully responsible through a turnkey contract, signed in June 2000, for the delivery of the reactor, performing the design, construction and commissioning. Local civil construction was performed by INVAP's partner, John Holland-Evans Deakin Industries. The facility features a large () liquid- deuterium cold neutron source, modern supermirror guides, and a guide hall. The cold source was designed by the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute, the cryogenic system designed and supplied by Air Liquide and the initial set of four supermirror guides supplied by Mirrotron. On 17 December 2001, 46 Greenpeace activists occupied the Lucas Heights facility to protest the construction of OPAL. Protestors gained access to the grounds, the HIFAR reactor, the high-level radioactive waste store and the radio tower. Their protest highlighted the security and environmental risks of the production of nuclear materials and the shipment of radioactive waste from the facility. OPAL was opened on 20 April 2007 by then Australian Prime Minister John Howard and is the replacement for the HIFAR reactor. ANSTO received an operating licence from the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) in July 2006, allowing commencement of hot commissioning, where fuel is first loaded into the reactor core. OPAL went critical for the first time on the evening of 12 August 2006 and reached full power for the first time on the morning of 3 November 2006. ==Facility details== The OPAL reactor pools. Made of stainless steel and wide, it contains demineralised water used for shielding and cooling. The reactor core consists of 16 low-enriched plate-type fuel assemblies and is located under of water in an open pool. Light water (normal H2O) is used as the coolant and moderator while heavy water (D2O) is used as the neutron reflector. The purpose of the neutron reflector is to improve neutron economy in the reactor, and hence to increase the maximum neutron flux. OPAL is the centrepiece of the facilities at ANSTO, providing radiopharmaceutical and radioisotope production, irradiation services (including neutron transmutation doping of silicon), neutron activation analysis and neutron beam research. OPAL is able to produce four times as many radioisotopes for nuclear medicine treatments as the old HIFAR reactor, and a wider array of radioisotopes for the treatment of disease. The modern design includes a cold neutron source (CNS). The OPAL reactor already has received seven awards in Australia. ==Neutron scattering at OPAL== The Bragg Institute at ANSTO hosts OPAL's neutron scattering facility. It is now running as a user facility serving the scientific community in Australia and around the world. New funding was received in 2009 in order to install further competitive instruments and beamlines. The actual facility comprises the following instruments: ===ECHIDNA=== Engineering drawing of the ECHIDNA High-Resolution Powder Diffractometer (August 2003) The Ge-115 monochromator has been acquired from the Brookhaven National Laboratory. ECHIDNA is the name of the high- resolution neutron powder diffractometer. The instrument serves to determine the crystalline structures of materials using neutron radiation analogous to X-ray techniques. It is named after the Australian monotreme echidna, as the spiny peaks of the instrument looks like an echidna. It operates with thermal neutrons. One of the main features is the array of 128 collimators and position sensitive detectors for rapid data acquisition. ECHIDNA allows for structure determinations, texture measurements and reciprocal space mapping of single crystals in most different sample environments serving the physics, chemistry, materials, minerals and earth-science communities. ECHIDNA is part of the Bragg Institute's park of neutron scattering instruments. ====Components==== * Neutron guide *: The instrument is located on the TG1 thermal neutron guide of the OPAL reactor. The distance from the reactor is . The position is the second on the guide after the WOMBAT instrument. The size of the guide is high by wide, and it is plated with supermirror coatings. * Primary collimator *: There are S√∂ller collimators prior to the monochromator in order to reduce the divergence of the beam and to increase the angular resolution of the instrument. Since this is an intensity compromise, two items of 5' and 10', respectively, can be interchanged or fully removed by an automated mechanism. The collimators cover the full size of the beam delivered by the neutron guide. * Monochromator *: The monochromator is made by slabs of [115] oriented Germanium crystals which are inclined towards each other in order to focus down the Bragg reflected beam. The device has been acquired from the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the US after the shutdown of their neutron facility. * Secondary collimator *: Optionally a secondary collimator with 10' angular acceptance and can be placed in the monochromatic beam between the monochromator and the sample, which again influences the resolution function of the instrument. * Slit system *: Two automated sets of horizontal and vertical pairs of absorbing plates allow to cut down the size of the monochromatic beam prior to the secondary collimator and sample size. They remove unwanted neutrons and reduce the background near the detector. In addition, they allow selection of the sample position to be studied. * Beam monitor *: A 235U fission monitor measures the amount of neutrons incident to the sample. The efficiency is 10‚àí4 and most neutrons traverse the device undisturbed. The monitor counts are important to correct for beam flux variations due to changes in the reactor or at the upstream instrument. * Sample stage *:The sample is supported by a heavy load goniometer consisting of a 360¬∞ vertical omega rotation axis, x-y translation tables and a chi-phi cross tilt stage of ¬±20¬∞ range. It can hold a few hundred kilograms in order to support heavier sample environments, such as cryostats, furnaces, magnets, load frames, reaction chambers and others. A typical powder sample is filled into vanadium cans which give little unstructured background. The mentioned sample environment allows measurement of changes in the sample as a function of external parameters, like temperature, pressure, magnetic field, etc. The goniometer stage is redundant for most powder diffraction measurements, but will be important for single crystal and texture measurements, where the orientation of the sample plays a role. * Detector collimators *:A set of 128 detectors each equipped which a 5' collimator in front are arranged in a 160¬∞ sector focusing to the sample. The collimators select the scattered radiation into the well defined ranges of 128 angular positions. The whole collimator and detector setup is mounted on a common table which is scanned in finer steps around the sample, to be combined further into a continuous diffraction pattern. * Detector tubes *:The 128 linear position-sensitive 3He gas detector tubes cover the full opening height of behind the collimators. They determine the position of the neutron event by charge division over the resistive anode towards each end of the detector. Overall and local count rates lie in the several 10000 Hz range. ===PLATYPUS=== PLATYPUS is a time-of-flight reflectometer built on the cold neutron source. The instrument serves to determine the structure of interfaces using highly collimated neutron beams. These beams are shone on to the surface at low angles (typically less than 2 degrees) and the intensity of the reflected radiation is measured as a function of angle of incidence. It operates using cold neutrons with a wavelength band of 0.2‚Äì2.0 nm. Although up to three different angles of incidence are required for each reflectivity curve, the time-of-flight nature means that timescales of kinetic processes are accessible. By analysing the reflected signal one builds a picture of the chemical structure of the interface. This instrument can be used for examining biomembranes, lipid bilayers, magnetism, adsorbed surfactant layers, etc. it is named after Ornithorhynchus anatinus, the semi-aquatic mammal native to Australia. ===WOMBAT=== WOMBAT is a high-intensity neutron powder diffractometer. The instrument serves to determine the crystalline structures of materials using neutron radiation analogous to X-ray techniques. It is named after the wombat, a marsupial indigenous to Australia. It will operate with thermal neutrons. It has been designed for highest flux and data acquisition speed in order to deliver time resolved diffraction patterns in a fraction of a second. Wombat will concentrate on in-situ studies and time critical investigations, such as structure determinations, texture measurements and reciprocal space mapping of single crystals in most different sample environments serving the physics, chemistry, materials, minerals and earth-science communities. ===KOWARI=== KOWARI is a neutron residual stress diffractometer. Strain scanning using thermal neutrons is a powder diffraction technique in a polycrystalline block of material probing the change of atomic spacing due to internal or external stress. It is named after the kowari, an Australian marsupial. It provides a diagnostic non-destructive tool to optimise e.g. post weld heat treatment (PWHT, similar to tempering) of welded structures. Tensile stresses for example drive crack growth in engineering components and compressive stresses inhibit crack growth (for example cold-expanded holes subject to fatigue cycling). Life extension strategies have high economic impact and strain scanning provides the stresses needed to calculate remaining life as well as the means to monitor the condition of components since it is non-destructive. One of the main features is the sample table that will allow examination of large engineering components while orienting and positioning them very accurately. ===Others=== * TAIPAN - Thermal 3-Axis Spectrometer * KOALA - Laue Diffractometer * QUOKKA - Small-Angle Neutron Scattering * PELICAN - Cold- Neutron Time-of-Flight Spectrometer * SIKA - Cold 3-Axis Spectrometer * KOOKABURRA - Ultra-Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (USANS) * DINGO - Neutron Radiography, Tomography and Imaging ==Performance== During the initial testing and commissioning stages each equipment and system was tested isolated and then in an integrated manner. First tests were carried out without nuclear fuel loaded into the core, and then a careful plan was followed for loading nuclear fuel in the reactor core and reaching a nuclear chain for the first time. Successive increasing power steps were followed to get the reactor to run at full power. Once commissioning was completed, the Australian Nuclear regulatory Body (ARPANSA) issued a licence that authorise its operation at full power. During the first operation cycles a typical teething period of a first of a kind design followed. The reactor has shown to be a reliable supplier of radiopharmaceuticals, while also serving as a neutron source to conduct material research activities using the several instruments. Since commissioned the reactor has been running with a very high availability, during the term 2012-13 it operated 265 days at full power (including an extended routine maintenance period), during 2013-14 for 294 days at full power, and during 2014-15 it operated 307 days at full power. As at September 2016 it has accumulated a total of 2200 equivalent Full Power Days. Each 30 days operating cycle more than 150 batches of Silicon are irradiated, Mo99 is produced on a regular basis for the nuclear medicine market. OPAL has delivered 4 million doses. Regarding research with neutrons the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering (formerly Bragg Institute) features more than 120 scientists and 13 neutron beam operational instruments, and has produced more than 600 scientific research papers using the neutrons coming from OPAL core. ==See also== * Spallation Neutron Source * Nuclear medicine ==References== ==External links== *OPAL *KOWARI *ECHIDNA *Bragg Institute *INVAP Nuclear Division designs *Announcement of the new reactor's name *Nuclear reactor to reopen after six-month shutdown *Govt expects nuclear reactor to restart this month *Reactor ready for second try Category:Nuclear research reactors Category:Light water reactors Category:Neutron facilities Category:Nuclear research institutes Category:Research institutes in Australia Category:Lucas Heights, New South Wales Category:2007 establishments in Australia ","title":"Open-pool Australian lightwater reactor"},{"id":"1426528","text":"Prince Janusz Ostrogski () (1554 ‚Äì 17 September 1620 in Tarn√≥w) was a Ruthenian noble and statesman of Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth.

Massingham, by Elliott & Fry, 1948 Harold John Massingham (25 March 1888 ‚Äì 22 August 1952)Oxford DNB entry. Accessed 8 January 2013 was a prolific British writer on ruralism, matters to do with the countryside and agriculture. He was also a published poet. ==Life== Massingham was the son of the journalist H. W. Massingham. He was brought up in London, and educated at Westminster School and Queen's College, Oxford. He failed to graduate from Oxford, because of bad health. He then became a journalist in London.http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=007-massingham&cid;=0#0 He worked for the Morning Leader, Athenaeum, and the Nation,http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/Massingham,+Harold+John and knew D. H. Lawrence. In the 1920s he became a research assistant for two anthropologists from University College, London, and an interest in archeology and anthropology, which proved lifelong, led to the publication of Downland Man (1926) and a number of other works. He worked on a research project whose aim was to show that all megalithic culture in England had spread from Egypt. By 1932 Massingham began to write more and more on country life, and the first of a long series of such books, possibly his best-known, was Wold Without End (1932), reflecting his experiences living in Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds. A serious accident happened in 1937, when he injured his leg, leading to a two-year period of regular hospital visits, at the end of which he hurt the same leg again, and it had to be amputated. He was forced to stop travelling as frequently as he had been doing and settled down to writing some thirty more books. He was strongly influenced by the writings of Gilbert White and edited selections of White's writings. David Pepper, Modern Environmentalism: An Introduction, Routledge, 1996 (p. 170). He was one of a group of ruralist British writers of the period; Massingham's friend Adrian Bell, a farmer in Suffolk, was another prominent writer, and John Musty suggests that Massingham may have had a hand in getting Bell published. They have attracted subsequent attention both as precursors to later developments, such as organic farming, and because of their political entanglements in the 1930s (for example, Henry Williamson was a supporter of Oswald Mosley). Massingham himself wrote in a vein compatible with the Social Credit and distributist ideas current at the time, as in his 1943 The Tree of Life. He was one of the twelve members of the Kinship in Husbandry, set up in 1941 by Rolf Gardiner, a society dedicated to countryside revival in a post-war world. According to academics Richard Moore-Colyer and Philip Conford, Massingham was uncomfortable with what he felt was a pro-German tendency in this group. When the Kinship later merged with two other bodies to form the Soil Association, Massingham with Gardiner, the landowner Lord Portsmouth and the agricultural journalist Lawrence Easterbrook came onto the Soil Association's Council. After Massingham's death his collection of tools, implements and products of craftsmanship and husbandry were donated to the Museum of English Rural Life.

It is in a region of the island often referred to as the North Shore, Staten Island. ==Description== The word \\"corners\\" in the neighborhood's name refers to the intersection of Victory Boulevard and Manor Road, which forms its core. This part of Castleton, Staten Island was once called Centerville, but became more popularly known as Castleton Corners when a post office by that name was opened there in 1872. \\"Castleton\\" refers to Cassiltowne, County Kildare, Ireland, the birthplace of Thomas Dongan, the colonial governor of the Province of New York after it was obtained from the Dutch--who had called it New Amsterdam--in 1682. The post office later closed, but reopened in 1949, and today it is the general, or main, post office for Staten Island as a whole, its ZIP Code being 10314. A hotel in the early 20th century Castleton Corners is separated from its eastern neighbor Sunnyside by Castleton Hill, noted for the two churches that stand across from one another on its western ridge--a Moravian church (Castleton Hill Moravian Church) on one side of Victory Boulevard and a Roman Catholic church (St. Teresa's) on the other. To the north lies West Brighton, with the Staten Island Armory of the New York Army National Guard at the boundary between the two. Westerleigh and Meiers Corners lie to the northwest and southwest, respectively, and Todt Hill rises to the south. The Todt Hill public housing project is actually in Castleton Corners in spite of its name. The corner of Victory Boulevard and Manor Road has long been the center of an important commercial district, although its prominence has declined somewhat in recent decades due to the opening of the Staten Island Mall in 1973. The area had largely been built up by the time the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened in 1964. Castleton Corners was relatively unaffected by the dramatic upsurge in population after the bridge's opening, compared with most other neighborhoods on the island. ==Education== Schools are P.S. 29 and St. Teresa's School. ==Transportation== Castleton Corners is served by the local bus routes, and the express bus routes. The former S67 route through Castleton Corners was discontinued in 2010 due to low ridership, and many bus routes through the area were truncated to run a shorter route or only during weekdays.Subway and Staten Island Railway Service Reductions, mta.info.

He served for two non-consecutive terms under two different administrations. Toledo was a former attorney and FBI agent. ==Early years and studies== Pedro Toledo D√°vila was born in 1943 to Pedro Toledo and Gladys D√°vila at Hospital Dr. Pila in Ponce, Puerto Rico. He lived with his mother in Juana D√≠az, until his father returned from World War II. After that, they moved to Ponce, where Toledo attended elementary and secondary school, graduating in 1961. Toledo enrolled at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez where he obtained a degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1966. Toledo then went to work for NASA at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, as an air conditioning systems engineer for the Saturn V and Apollo missions. ==Career with the FBI== In 1968, Toledo was accepted into the Federal Bureau of Investigations. Toledo has said \\"I had finished the career in engineering but there are a lot of lawyers in my family, and I believed that [by joining the FBI] I could indirectly enter the field of law.\\" As part of the FBI, he was assigned as an agent to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he worked until November 1969. That year, he was transferred to Miami, Florida. In 1971, Toledo was moved to Puerto Rico, where he began law school at the Interamerican University Law School, and graduated in 1974 with a Juris Doctor degree. During his time with the FBI, Toledo also worked as legal adviser. He also attended the Bureau's technology and polygraph schools, as well as hostage negotiator's school. He eventually joined a specialized national team of negotiators called the Critical Incident Negotiation Team. Toledo was the main negotiator in 1987 during the Atlanta Prison Riots. The riots were caused by a group of Cuban inmates who refused to be repatriated to Cuba after the Mariel boatlift. The negotiation process took two weeks, and nearly collapsed when U.S. supervisors withdrew Toledo's team to reestablish negotiations in English with a translator. Toledo said about the incident \\"Six hours after they did that there was a near riot. Inmates broke the phone used for negotiations and demanded that we, the Latinos, be called back,\\" Toledo remembered. \\"They had to do it. Once we were back, the inmates, in a show of good will, immediately freed some hostages.\\" Toledo was appointed supervisor of the Violent Crimes Unit of the FBI in San Juan in 1989. In 1991, Toledo also participated in negotiations during riots at the federal prison in Talladega, Alabama. During the riots, over nine hostages were taken by 121 Cuban detainees. The Cubans, who had arrived in the U.S. during the boatlift, were trying to avoid deportation, and refused to negotiate. Toledo was asked to buy time so that SWAT teams could effectively prepare for a raid. In 1992, Toledo was the second in charge of the FBI in Puerto Rico. ==Puerto Rico Police== ===First term (1993-2001)=== After his time with the FBI, Toledo became supervisor of the Violent Crimes division for the Policia de Puerto Rico. When Pedro Rossell√≥ was elected Governor of Puerto Rico during the elections, he selected Toledo to be the Puerto Rico Police Superintendent. Toledo, who was a known supporter of Rossello's party (PNP), became known for his firm stance against crime, which he dubbed \\"Mano Dura contra el Crimen\\" (\\"Strong arm against crime\\"). Some of Toledo's initiatives against drugs and violence involved the collaboration with the National Guard and the occupation of public housing projects (or \\"caser√≠os\\"). During his tenure, murders in the island went from its highest peak in recent years (995 in 1994Negro r√©cord de asesinatos en Puerto Rico on El Nuevo Herald (December 30, 2008)) to its lowest (690 in 20002000-2010: Lo que nos dicen los ciclos on El Vocero; Rossell√≥, Ricardo (January 5, 2011)). In 2000, elected Governor Sila Mar√≠a Calder√≥n appointed Miguel Pereira as Superintendent of the Puerto Rico Police. Toledo announced his retirement from the force, and dedicated himself to a small law practice in association with one of his sons. ===Second term (2005-2009)=== In 2005, elected Governor An√≠bal Acevedo Vil√° (from the PPD) appointed Toledo as Superintendent. Despite his opposing political beliefs, Toledo return to the Police helm. During this time, Toledo led a restructuring of the Police Department assigning police chiefs for the narcotics, illegal weapons, and internal affairs division, among others. ==Later years and death== After his second stint as Superintendent, Toledo returned to private life, but was regularly interviewed for his opinion on security matters of the island. On December 23, 2012, Toledo was taken to Hospital Auxilio Mutuo in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, where he died of a heart attack. As a result, Governor Luis Fortu√±o declared a day of mourning on December 26.

Known for their blazing fast speed and melodic vocals, the band have also appeared on the Warped Tour and Groezrock Festival bills. Taking their name from the '80s sitcom, Belvedere began in Calgary, Alberta, in 1995 as the three-piece of Steve Rawles (guitar/vocals), Brock (bass), and Dan Hrynuik (drums). As the years progressed along with their revolving lineup, Belvedere remained with their melodic pop-punk sound that looked up to the likes of Bad Religion and NOFX. Eventually recruiting second guitarist Scott Marshall, replacement drummer Jay Hollywood, and a replacement bassist Jason Sinclair, the quartet released their debut album, Because No One Stopped Us, in 1998 through Hourglass and 206 Records. After spending most of 1999 on the road - along with Bad Religion and Strung Out, for a stint - Jump Start Records released Belvedere's follow-up album, Angels Live in My Town, in early 2000. In 2001, Jump Start Records and the Montreal imprint Union 2112 released Twas Hell Said Former Child, Belvedere's proper second album that coincided their first ever European tour. A split release with Downway, Hometown Advantage, was issued in 2003. When it came time to reconvene for another studio album, Belvedere joined producer Blair Calibaba (Sum 41) in Calgary for the recording of Fast Forward Eats the Tape. They shared dates with Death by Stereo, Tsunami Bomb and Misconduct followed in spring 2004. The band broke up in late 2005, playing their last show to their hometown Calgary crowd in November. Steve and Graham later went on to form This is a Standoff in 2007. After seven years apart Belvedere got back together for a reunion tour in 2012. These shows took place in Canada, South America and Europe. As of late 2011, it was unknown whether Belvedere would be releasing new material and playing shows beyond their 2012 reunion tour commitments. Although no plans had been made to officially reunite as a band, lead singer Steve Rawles confirmed that he had been writing new song material as of late 2013. Bassist Jason Sinclair has very recently confirmed they are officially reunited as a band and have begun recording new songs. The band announced in November 2015 that they are working on recording a new album, however it was confirmed that there was a lineup change with Casey Lewis replacing Graham Churchill on drums due to conflicting commitments outside the band. On April 30th, 2016 the band released The Revenge of the Fifth, their fifth studio album. As of late 2019, Jason Sinclair and Scott Marshall were no longer playing members of the band citing creative differences as their reason for departure.

It includes numerous tutorials by International Master Joshua Waitzkin and GM Larry Christiansen for players of all skill levels. Also contains the minigames Fork my fruit (which practices forking), Minesweeper (practices safety of pieces) and the tail game (where the player chooses a long-range chess piece, then trying to make a long tail using captured pieces, and avoiding the enemy pieces to capture the main piece or tail parts). ==Chess engine== Chessmaster 10th Edition The Chessmaster chess engine is called The King, written by Johan de K√∂ning of the Netherlands. It was introduced in Chessmaster 4000; the first edition featured a chess engine written by David Kittinger, who went on to develop the engines for Interplay's USCF Chess, WChess for the German company Millennium 2000, and Sierra Entertainment's Power Chess, Majestic Chess and Disney's Aladdin Chess Adventures. The second edition had an engine designed by Kate and Dan Spracklen of Sargon fame. According to the September 2009 Swedish Chess Computer Association (SSDF) rating list, Chessmaster 9000 had an estimated Elo rating of 2718 on an Athlon-1200 PC. If multiple versions of other engines are stripped out of this list, Chessmaster 9000 ranked 14th among all engines tested. , Chessmaster 9000 remained the most recent version rated by the SSDF. The latest version, Chessmaster 11th Edition, was released in 2007, and has lagged behind more current chess engines. CCRL placed it 121st on its August 2020 list (15th among engines only available via purchase). The King engine allows users to create new playing styles, called \\"personalities\\", by manipulating several dozen different settings, such as King Safety, Pawn Weakness, Randomness, Mobility and others. Individual piece values can also be adjusted. Chessmaster 9000, for example, features over 150 different personalities ranging from International Grandmaster strength down to Stanley, a chimpanzee who, in most situations, plays completely random moves. The Stanley chimpanzee personality inspired the Stanley Random Chess Variant.Verdra H. Ciretop (12 March 2004) \\"Stanley Random Chess Introduced & Explained for Beginners\\".

The Chessmaster program was operated by John Merlino, the Project Manager of Chessmaster at the time of the match. Four different personalities were used in the match, the first three of which were based on famous human Grandmasters: Alexander Alekhine, Bobby Fischer, and Mikhail Botvinnik. The final game of the match used the default \\"Chessmaster\\" personality. Christiansen won the first game, lost the second and third games, and the fourth game resulted in a draw. ==Platforms== To date, various versions of Chessmaster have appeared on Amiga, Apple II, Apple IIGS, Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, MSX, Commodore 64, DOS, PC, Macintosh, Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, Sega Genesis (as a Sega Channel exclusive), Sega Game Gear, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and mobile phones. Early Macintosh versions Chessmaster 3000 and 4000 were developed by Sebastian Rapport and Troy Heere that leveraged the Kittinger and de Koning engines respectively. Later Macintosh versions were ported by Feral Interactive, and the latest Macintosh version available is Chessmaster 9000. Ubisoft also offers a downloadable version of the game, Chessmaster Challenge, which differs from Chessmaster 10th Edition in its simplified interface and scaled-down tutorials.Chessmaster Challenge Ubisoft The more recent editions of Chessmaster include both 2D and 3D designs, and a large number of different boards and themed chess piece designs. The interface was revised for Chessmaster 10th Edition and features animated 3D sets in which the pieces \\"walk\\" between squares and have simulated battles when a piece is taken, reminiscent of Battle Chess or the Wizard's chess set from Harry Potter. Chessmaster 10th Edition also comes packed with a pair of red and blue glasses to view the set in \\"enhanced 3D\\". ===Xbox Live Arcade=== An Xbox Live Arcade version with Xbox Live multiplayer and Xbox Live Vision camera support for the Xbox 360 called Chessmaster Live was released on 30 January 2008, but is no longer available. This version of Chessmaster contained a bug allowing the white player to indefinitely hold up a match until a player resigned.

The wartime organisation was created on 27 September 1939, actively resisted and fought German occupation in Warsaw until 18 January 1945, and contributed to the resistance operations of the Polish Underground State. Some of its members (' ‚Äì Assault Groups) were among the Home Army's best-trained troops. Though formally independent, the Gray Ranks worked closely with the Government Delegation for Poland and Home Army Headquarters. The Gray Ranks had known under the cryptonym Pasieka (\\"bee yard\\") staffed by the Chief Scout of Gray Ranks plus three to five deputies in the rank of Harcmistrz (Scoutmaster). == Overview == Since its organization in 1916, scouts within the Polish Scouting and Guiding Association (ZwiƒÖzek Harcerstwa Polskiego, ZHP) had taken active part in all the conflicts Poland was engaged in around this time: Great Poland Uprising, Polish-Bolshevik War, Silesian Uprisings, and the Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War. After the German Invasion of Poland in 1939, the Nazis recognized the ZHP as a threat. Polish Scouts and Guides were branded as criminals and banned. Under the leadership of Florian Marciniak, the ZHP carried on as a clandestine organization. The wartime Scouts evolved into the paramilitary Szare Szeregi (Gray Ranks), reporting up through the Polish underground state and the Armia Krajowa resistance. The codename Szare Szeregi was adopted in 1940. It was first used by underground scouting in Pozna≈Ñ. The name was coined after an early action of the Polish Scouting Association, in which boy scouts distributed propaganda leaflets among Germans from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia who had settled in the homes of Poles expelled to the General Government. To create confusion, the leaflets had been signed SS‚Äîlater expanded to Szare Szeregi, a name that came to be adopted by the entire organization. Older Scouts carried out sabotage, armed resistance, and assassinations. The Girl Guides formed auxiliary units working as nurses, liaisons and munition carriers. Younger Scouts were involved in so-called minor sabotage under the auspice of the Wawer organization, which included dropping leaflets or painting the kotwica sign on the walls. During Operation Tempest, and especially during the Warsaw Uprising, the Scouts participated in the fighting, and several Szare Szeregi units were some of the most effective in combat. The Gray Ranks also included the White Couriers, who between late fall 1939 and mid-1940 helped smuggle many persons out of Soviet-occupied southeastern Poland into Hungary. In 1940, the Soviet Union executed most of the Boy Scouts held at Ostashkov prison. In 1945 the ZHP restored its former name and returned to public existence. However, the communist authorities of Poland pressured the organization to become a member of the Pioneer Movement and eventually it was banned in 1949. The only existing part of pre-war ZHP during the year of the Communist regime was the ZHP pgK.ZHP pgK (ZHP abroad) consists of Polish Scouts from USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Argentina, France and Sweden == Principles == The Gray Ranks followed the prewar principles of the Polish Scouting Association: service to the people and country, and education and improvement of their skills. In addition to the prewar oath, the following line was added: :\\"I pledge to you that I shall serve with the Grey Ranks, safeguard the secrets of the organization, obey orders, and not hesitate to sacrifice my life.\\" In addition to the Scouting moral code, the Gray Ranks also followed a basic three-step path of action. The program was nicknamed \\"Dzi≈õ - jutro - pojutrze\\" (\\"Today - tomorrow - the day after\\"): * \\"Today\\" ‚Äì struggle for Poland's independence * \\"Tomorrow\\" ‚Äì prepare for an all-national uprising and the liberation of Poland * \\"The Day After\\" ‚Äì prepare to rebuild Poland after the war == Structure == The Gray Ranks' structure was based on the prewar structure of the Polish Scouting Association, modified to suit the new circumstances of occupation and repression. The basic unit was the troop (dru≈ºyna), comprising some 20 boys or girls. Each troop was composed of several squads (zastƒôpy), each zastƒôp comprising 7 persons. Several troops from a specified area (city district, village or town) formed a district (hufiec), which in turn formed part of a region (chorƒÖgiew ‚Äî literally, a banner or standard). During World War II, the several units were referred to by their own code-names: * \\"banner\\" (chorƒÖgiew) ‚Äì ul (\\"beehive\\") * \\"district\\" (hufiec) ‚Äì r√≥j (\\"swarm\\") * \\"troop\\" (dru≈ºyna) ‚Äì rodzina (\\"family\\") * \\"squad\\" (zastƒôp) ‚Äì pszczo≈Çy (\\"bees\\") The were code-named \\"Bee Yard\\" (Pasieka), headed by the commander (Naczelnik) The Gray Ranks' successive commanders were: * Florian Marciniak (27 September 1939 ‚Äì 6 May 1943) * Stanis≈Çaw Broniewski (\\"Orsza\\"; 12 May 1943 ‚Äì 3 October 1944) * Leon Marsza≈Çek (3 October 1944 ‚Äì 18 January 1945) At the apogee of the Gray Ranks' strength, Headquarters commanded 20 banners. To control the movement, the area of prewar Poland was divided into departments, each supervising several banners: * Western Department (Wydzia≈Ç Zachodni, Z) ‚Äì areas annexed by Nazi Germany: ** Pomeranian banner ‚Äì ul \\"Lina\\" (beehive Line) ** Greater Polish ‚Äì ul \\"Przemys≈Çaw\\" (beehive Przemys≈Çaw) ** ≈Å√≥d≈∫ ‚Äì ul \\"Kominy\\" (beehive Chimneys) ** Zag≈Çƒôbie ‚Äì ul \\"Barbara\\" (beehive Barbara) ** Silesian ‚Äì ul \\"Huta\\" (beehive Steel mill) An additional banner was formed in the General Government and commanded all the scouts from Greater Poland expelled from their homes by the Germans (ul \\"Chrobry\\" - beehive Chrobry). * Eastern Department (Wydzia≈Ç Wschodni, W) ‚Äì eastern voivodeships of Poland ** Bia≈Çystok ‚Äì ul \\"Bia≈Çy\\" (beehive White) ** Wilno ‚Äì ul \\"Brama\\" (beehive Gate) ** Polesie ‚Äì ul \\"B≈Çota\\" (beehive Marshes) ** Nowogr√≥dek ‚Äì ul \\"Las\\" (beehive Forest) ** Wo≈Çy≈Ñ ‚Äì ul \\"Gleba\\" (beehive Soil) An additional banner was formed for scouts expelled from their homes to the General Government (ul Z≈Çoty ‚Äì \\"Gold beehive\\"). * Central Poland Department (Wydzia≈Ç Polski Centralnej, C) ** Warsaw ‚Äì ul \\"Wis≈Ça\\" (beehive Vistula) ** Masovian ‚Äì ul \\"Puszcza\\" (beehive Wilderness) ** Radom ‚Äì ul \\"Rady\\" (beehive Councils) ** Lublin ‚Äì ul \\"Zbo≈ºe\\" (beehive Grain) * Southern Poland Department (Wydzia≈Ç Polski Po≈Çudniowej, P) ** Kielce ‚Äì ul \\"Ska≈Ça\\" (beehive Rock) ** Czƒôstochowa ‚Äì ul \\"Warta\\" (beehive Warta) ** Krak√≥w ‚Äì ul \\"Smok\\" (beehive Dragon) * Lw√≥w ‚Äì ul \\"Lew\\" (beehive Lion) Coordination among the departments and beehives was directed by inspectors subordinate to the Headquarters: Eugeniusz Stasiecki, Edward Zurn and Kazimierz Grenda. == Ranks by age == The Kotwica sign, painted by Gray Ranks on pedestal of the 1932 Warsaw Aviators' Monument As of 1 May 1944, the Gray Ranks numbered 8,359 members. Initially only older scouts (Senior Scouts, Senior Guides, Rovers and Rangers), aged 17 and up, were admitted. Soon, however, younger children were admitted, and in 1942 a new structure was adopted, based largely on the prewar structure of the Polish Scouting Association. === Zawisza === Jan Kili≈Ñski statue Postmen during the Warsaw Uprising Monument to Ma≈Çy Powstaniec (Little partisan) in Warsaw, erected to commemorate all the children that fought and fell in the Warsaw Uprising Zawisza (plural Zawiszacy) was a group of the youngest Scouts of the Szare Szeregi. Troops organised for children between 12 and 14 years of age were code-named Zawisza, after Zawisza Czarny, a medieval Polish knight and diplomat. The troops did not take part in active resistance. Instead, the children were prepared for auxiliary service for the upcoming all-national uprising and taught in secret schools for their future duties in liberated Poland. Among the best-known auxiliary troops formed by the Zawiszacy was the Scouting Postal Service organised during the Warsaw Uprising. === Combat Schools === The Combat Schools (Bojowe Szko≈Çy) comprised youngsters aged 15 to 17. They took part in \\"small-sabotage\\" operations. These included propaganda operations directed at the Poles, German civilians and German military units. The best-known operations were: * Operation Wawer- Palmiry ‚Äì a major propaganda campaign which included painting patriotic and anti-German slogans on walls (see also kotwica); distribution of leaflets, posters stickers, and fake issues of supposed German newspapers; intercepting German propaganda megaphones and using them to spread Polish propaganda; destroying German flags and other symbols; disrupting German events by setting off fire alarms; and, last but not least, stink-bombing German-operated movie theaters. Probably the best-known action was the removal of a German-language plaque that had been attached by the Germans to the Nicolaus Copernicus Monument in Warsaw, claiming the astronomer for the German nation. * Operation N ‚Äì the distribution of propaganda newspapers and leaflets among German soldiers stationed in Poland. * Operation WISS (Wywiad ‚Äì Informacja Szarych Szereg√≥w, Grey Ranks Intelligence)‚Äîan operation on behalf of Home Army intelligence, in which Combat Schools groups carried out surveillance of German military units and their movements. The information that was gathered was passed on to the Allies. The operation provided the Allies with complete lists of German units, their insignia and approximate complements, including units down to battalion size. Other famous operations included marking street lamps as \\"Nur f√ºr Deutsche\\" (\\"Only for Germans\\"), implying that those who hanged people would themselves be hanged (from street lamps). Other operations occurred after the Germans began destroying monuments to Polish national heroes and historical personalities. These included a monument to Jan Kili≈Ñski, leader of an 18th-century Warsaw uprising against the Russians during the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising. The Germans dismantled the monument and placed it in the cellars of the former National Museum, for delivery to a German steel mill. The scouts were notified of where the monument was hidden and overnight marked the walls of the former museum, \\"People of Warsaw! I am here. Kili≈Ñski\\". As part of their secret training, the Combat Schools boys and girls prepared for service with the Home Army as members of commanders' troops, communication units, and reconnaissance units. During the Warsaw Uprising, Combat Schools units in Warsaw's Downtown District formed a company; in other districts, they formed platoons. === Assault groups === Girl-guide postmen during Warsaw Uprising The Assault Groups (Grupy Szturmowe), comprising youngsters aged 17 and up, were directly subordinate to the Home Army's KeDyw (Directorate of Diversion). The groups trained at secret NCO schools and officer schools for commanders of motorised and engineering units. Most members also studied at underground universities, to gain knowledge necessary to reconstruct Poland after the war. The best-known NCO schools included Warsaw's Agricola. The assault groups took part in \\"major sabotage\\", including armed struggle against the occupiers. The assault groups formed the backbone of the Home Army's special troops. They liberated prisoners from German prisons and transports, blew up railroad bridges, carried out executions ordered by special courts, and fought pitched battles against German forces. The assault groups in Warsaw were organised into several battalions, including the famous \\"Baszta\\", \\"Zo≈õka\\", \\"Parasol\\" and \\"Wigry\\", which later took part in the Warsaw Uprising and were among the most notable and successful units on the Polish side. Other units, mainly in the Radom-Kielce area, joined the partisan units operating in the forests of the ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Mountains. == Assault-group operations == Gƒôsi√≥wka inmates and \\"Zo≈õka\\"-battalion assault- group soldiers after the camp's liberation Notable assault-group operations included: * Operation Arsenal (March 26, 1943), the liberation of the gravely wounded Jan Bytnar and 24 other prisoners from a Gestapo convoy * Operation Schultz (May 6, 1943), the assassination of SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer Herbert Schultz * Operation Lange (May 22, 1943), the assassination of SS-Rottenf√ºhrer Ewald Lange * Operation Belt (August 1943 ‚Äì February 1944), the destruction of thirteen German border outposts * Operation B√ºrkl (September 7, 1943), the assassination of SS-Oberscharf√ºhrer Franz B√ºrkl * Operation Kutschera (February 2, 1944), the assassination of SS and Police Leader Franz Kutschera * Storming and liberation of Gƒôsi√≥wka concentration camp in Warsaw (August 5, 1944) == See also == * Polish resistance movement in World War II * Battalion Parasol * Battalion Zo≈õka * Mury * Polish Secret State * Franz Six * ZwiƒÖzek Harcerstwa Polskiego * White Couriers == References == * Detailed article == External links == * Szare Szeregi * Details of Szare Szeregi most daring underground operations * Szare szeregi - Batalion \\"Baszta\\" * Batalion Parasol * Batalion Zo≈õka * The Heros of II World War * Historia Gimnazjum i Liceum im.

It is bounded on the north by Meredith Avenue and Victory Boulevard, on the east by the William T. Davis Wildlife Refuge, on the south by the Fresh Kills, and on the west by the Arthur Kill. Some local geographers classify Travis as being part of the island's West Shore, while others reckon it as a Mid-Island neighborhood. ==History== Travis is one of the oldest, as well as one of the more isolated and sparsely populated locales on Staten Island. The site of an Indian village, it was known as Jersey Wharf and, during the Revolutionary period, as New Blazing Star Ferry.New York Public Library Staten Island's Old Names, accessed August 18, 2006 It was a skirmish site during the Battle of Staten Island. It was the site of ferries from 1757 and was for decades part of the route between Philadelphia and New York via the Port Richmond Ferry. In the early 19th century the village was named Travisville after Captain Jacob Travis. In mid-century it was named Long Neck and then Deckertown after a local family. In 1873, the American Linoleum Company acquired 300 acres in the area to build the nation's first linoleum factory. The inventor of Linoleum, Frederick Walton, spent two years in Travis setting up the factory. Many skilled English immigrants arrived to work in the factory in its early days, and the area being was named Linoleumville. By the early 20th century, 700 workers were employed, comprising half the local population. Many of these were Polish immigrants, and Linoleumville had become a Polish enclave. The plant closed in 1931 and residents overwhelmingly chose to rename the community Travis. In later years, Travis's isolation has been somewhat disrupted by the construction of the West Shore Expressway and the Teleport. The area has sometimes suffered from poor air quality due to the nearby Fresh Kills Landfill and New Jersey's Chemical Coast. ==Culture== Sylvan Grove Cemetery Travis is noted throughout Staten Island for the colorful annual Independence Day parade,http://www.travisparade.org Travis Parade held since 1911. Many members of the community's founding families are buried in Sylvan Grove Cemetery, a small triangular burial ground near the junction of Victory Boulevard and the West Shore Expressway, which had fallen into severe disarray, mostly due to vandalism. An island-wide charitable organization, the Friends of Abandoned Cemeteries of Staten Island, was founded in 1982 in an effort to restore this and other assorted small cemeteries on the island that have been unused for decades, and in some cases, even centuries. Construction is scheduled for the area next to the cemetery to be turned into \\"Independence Park\\". Work began in November 2010.NYC Parks Daily Plant, 2010 November 15 Groundbreaking for Independence Park Travis is also home to the Mid Island Little League, who won the 1964 Little League World Series. Mid Island Little League is located at the intersection of Travis Avenue and Victory Boulevard. ==Facilities== The 1980s saw an expansion of commercial development along the West Shore Expressway, including a giant UA Movie and Bowling Complex; that complex no longer houses a movie theater. The West Shore Plaza was also built in this area, with the island's only Burlington Coat Factory as the anchor store (before this, it was a flea market, Bradlee's Store and Caldor). Also part of this expansion was a large industrial park called the Teleport, located at the eastern edge of Travis. It houses mostly companies engaged in the Internet and telecommunications industries. The service roads of the West Shore Expressway are also the site of retail and other businesses. Travis is home to FDNY Squad Company 8, which also houses a spare fire engine and Brush Fire Unit 4. Also protecting Travis is one of the last volunteer fire houses in the city, and second on Staten Island, Oceanic H&L; Company No. 1. Oceanic was formed in 1881, making it one of the oldest volunteer fire houses in the country. The fire house itself was located on the other side of town and moved down Victory Boulevard by horse to where it is today. The building of the UA movie theater complex has changed Travis dramatically over the last decade. Traffic patterns have changed along with new development of homes. Many of the older homes that sat on large plots of land are being torn down and replaced with new row homes. Even with this building boom, Travis has retained many of the characteristics that made it the last frontier on Staten Island. Still standing is the old Tennyson's Confectionery. It now is a balloon and party store, but this once held a penny candy store that was operational for almost one hundred years. It is located across from the Oceanic Hook and Ladder firehouse and was a popular hangout for the locals and firemen. Owned by \\"Snappy\\" Ed Tennyson, called that because he moved so slowly, it was handed down to his son-in-law, Robert Minto, Jr., who ran the store just about up to his death in 1986. ==Transportation== The western terminus of Victory Boulevard, a major thoroughfare on Staten Island, is at Travis. Established in 1816 by Daniel D. Tompkins as the Richmond Turnpike, this road was \\"promoted as the fastest route from New York to Philadelphia\\".New York Public Library Staten Island Timeline, accessed August 18, 2006 On this road, bus service along the island's North Shore to the College of Staten Island and St. George Ferry Terminal is provided by the routes. A ferry across the Arthur Kill linked Travis with Carteret, New Jersey. It stopped running in 1929. However, a passenger ferry did remain in operation until the mid-1960s. Travis is served by freight trains on the Travis Branch of the Staten Island Railway, which leads into the Howland Hook Container Terminal and the North Shore Branch. Travis is also served by direct express bus service to and from Manhattan during rush hours. The runs along Victory Boulevard. The run along the West Shore Expressway, but only the SIM2, SIM25 and SIM26 make stops in Travis along West Service Road (southbound) and East Service Road (northbound). == Education == Travis is home to PS26 of the New York City Department of Education. In early 2020 plans for a new 476 seat elementary school entered the public review process, as announced by Borough President James Oddo. ==Notable residents== * Paul Zindel grew up in Travis. During his teenage years, he stayed at 123 Glen Street. Zindel based many of his young-adult stories on Staten Island, particularly The Pigman, which is set on Howard Avenue in Grymes Hill, on the other side of Staten Island from Travis. * Billy Urbanski, a player for the Boston Braves, was born in \\"Linoleumville\\", which is in Travis. * Ichabod Crane was a real-life distinguished military officer who lived at 3525 Victory Boulevard, located within the modern boundaries of Travis. He detested Washington Irving for creating a fictional cowardly teacher of the same name and appearance in The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Irving and the real Crane met in 1814 early in Crane's military career. * Pfc. Fred J. Walczak was present at the famous flag raising at Iwo Jima. He appears in Joe Rosenthal's \\"Gung Ho\\" photo of the entire Marine patrol sent up Mount Suribachi to raise the flag. He was also wounded at Iwo Jima. He was from 150 Burke Ave in Travis. * Isabel Gonz√°lez, while not officially a resident, dragged then-called Linoleumville into the middle of the fight for Puerto Ricans' rights as US citizens. Her fianc√© had left her behind in Puerto Rico in 1902, so he could seek employment in the factory town of Linoleumville where her brother was already employed. When she attempted to join him, she was stopped by US Immigration officials and denied legal status due to her being unmarried and pregnant (and thus a possible burden on society). At the time, Puerto Ricans were not considered US citizens. This led to a series of legal battles including one before the Supreme Court. Her activism eventually led to Puerto Ricans being recognized as US citizens after Congress passed a law in 1917. ==Demographics== As of the 2010 census, the population of Travis was 2953. The demographics of Travis were roughly as follows: 71.% White, 3% Black, 16.9% Hispanic, 6% Asian, 2.2% Other. This is defining Travis as everything within the boundaries of Census Tract 291.02. Although it covers Bloomfield and Chelsea as well, almost all of the residents live in Travis. == External links == * Forgotten-NY: Travis, Staten Island * Sights and scenes in Travis * Interactive map of Travis * 1976 Bicentennial Travis 4th of July Parade ==References== Category:Neighborhoods in Staten Island ","title":"Travis, Staten Island"},{"id":"1426617","text":"Pavey Ark is a fell in the English county of Cumbria. It is one of the Langdale Pikes, lying to the north of Great Langdale, in the heart of the Lake District, immediately to the north-east of Harrison Stickle. ==Topography== From the shores of Stickle Tarn, Pavey Ark gives the impression of being a rocky ridge. In fact this is misleading, and the north-western side is simply an undulating area of moorland, rising towards Thunacar Knott. The summit plateau is characterised by tarns, rocky outcrops and bilberry terraces. Pavey Ark is the largest cliff in the Langdales, but faces east over Stickle Tarn and is less prominent from the floor of Great Langdale away to the south. The main face is a little over a quarter of a mile across and drops about 400 ft. To the south-west it merges into the crags of Harrison Stickle, while the northern end peters out into the valley of Bright Beck. Stickle Tarn is wholly within the territory of the Ark, a corrie tarn which has been dammed to create additional capacity. The stone-faced barrage is low enough not to spoil the character of the pool, and the water is used for public consumption in the hotels and homes below. The tarn has a depth of around 50 ft.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): ==Geology== The face is an outcrop of the formation named for the fell, the Pavey Ark Member. This consists of pebbly sandstone and breccia and is set within the Seathwaite Fell Formation of volcaniclastic sandstone with interbeds of tuff, lapilli-tuff, breccia and conglomerate.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 series maps: Sheet 38: BGS (1998) ==Ascents== Looking at Jack's Rake from Stickle Tarn. Walkers can be seen ascending the rake. Pavey Ark is most often climbed from the New Dungeon Ghyll Hotel, located some 1¬º miles (2 kilometres) to the south. The route follows Mill Gill up to Stickle Tarn, which can also be reached via a much less popular and more strenuous path following the Dungeon Ghyll ravines. From Stickle Tarn there is a choice of routes; one of the most popular is to follow a diagonal slit on Pavey Ark's craggy south-eastern face. This route is known as Jack's Rake, and requires scrambling. Alternative, easier, ascents are available on either side of the main crag. Jack's Rake is the most famous ascent of the Pavey Ark precipice. It is classified as a Grade 1 scramble, but it is within the capability of many walkers, though it does require a head for heights and is considerably harder in bad weather. The rake starts beneath the East Buttress at the precipice's eastern end, near a large cairn (with a tablet marked 'JWS 1900') immediately north of Stickle Tarn, and then climbs west across the face of the crag. The rake follows a natural groove in the precipice face and is clearly indicated by several Ash trees. Wainwright wrote that for fellwalkers Jack's Rake is \\"difficult and awkward\\", although there is \\"curiously little sense of exposure, for a comforting parapet of rock accompanies all the steeper parts of the ascent\\". The summit is a short walk from the top exit of the rake, which is also used as a descent route and by rockclimbers accessing the climbs on the cliff face. In separate incidents, two walkers fell to their deaths from Jack's Rake in June 2012. As with Lord's Rake on Scafell Crag, the word 'rake' refers to a path across major precipices, originally used by climbers for access to rock climbs, but which can also be used by walkers. Pavey Ark can also be ascended from Stickle Tarn via Easy Gully, North Rake or by the path to Harrison Stickle. Easy Gully is a steep walk on scree between the crags at the eastern end of the precipice, starting from the same place as Jack's Rake, and is blocked by large boulders near the top, where tough scrambling is required. North Rake (so named by Wainwright) starts from the path to High Raise at the very eastern end of the cliff and rises west over the top of the East Buttress. This is a much less exposed and strenuous walking route to the summit. ==Summit== There is no cairn on the bare rock of the summit, set back a few yards from the edge and a little to the north of the exit from Jack's Rake. The view north-west is perhaps spoilt by the long slopes of High Raise, but the Eastern and Southern Fells are well seenMark Richards: The Central Fells: Collins (2003): ==Rock climbs== The Pavey Ark crag is split by several large gullies and chimneys ‚Äî Little Gully, Great Gully, Crescent Gully, Gwynne's Chimney and Rake End Chimney. Other climbs include Crescent Slabs, Arcturus, Cruel Sister, Mother Courage, Sixpence and Impact Day. ==References== Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Nuttalls ","title":"Pavey Ark"},{"id":"1426628","text":"Bartley Campbell Bartley Theodore Campbell (August 12, 1843 ‚Äì July 30, 1888) was an American playwright of the latter 19th century. ==Early years== Campbell was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on August 12, 1843, to parents who had emigrated from Ireland. His writing career began at the age of 15 in 1858, when he took a job as a reporter for the Pittsburgh Post. He later became a drama critic for the Pittsburgh Leader, editor of the McKeesport Times, and founder of the Pittsburg Evening Mail and the Southern Monthly Magazine. ==Playwright years== The White Slave Campbell's playwright career began in 1871 with the play Through Fire, which ran for four weeks and motivated him to quit journalism. He wrote numerous plays for Pittsburgh's theatres which garnered him national attention.Conner, Lynne (2007). Pittsburgh In Stages: Two Hundred Years of Theater. University of Pittsburgh Press. pp. 39-40. . Retrieved 2011-06-06. He was quite successful and is often noted as the first American to earn a living solely as a playwright; however, there is some debate about whether or not he was truly the first. His other plays include Peril; or, Love at Long Branch (1872); Fate (1873); Risks; or, Insure Your Life, written for John Dillon (1873); The Virginian (1874); The Big Bonanza; My Partner (1879), The Galley Slave (1879); The White Slave (1882); Siberia (1882); and his final play, Paquita (1885). ==Final years== Campbell's health deteriorated under the strain of financial difficulties associated with his efforts to act as author, producer and director of his plays. He was declared insane in September 1886, and died in the State Hospital for the Insane in Middletown, New York on July 30, 1888. He is buried in St. Mary Cemetery in Pittsburgh's Lawrenceville neighborhood. Although his works contain language and situations that would be considered politically incorrect today, theatre troupes performing his plays can still be found over a century later. ==Sources== *A history of the New York stage, Volume 2 By Thomas Allston Brown ==External links== *Northern Illinois University Libraries Category:Writers from Pittsburgh Category:1843 births Category:1888 deaths Category:19th-century American dramatists and playwrights ","title":"Bartley Campbell"},{"id":"1426636","text":"Wootton Wawen is a village and civil parish in the Stratford-on-Avon district of Warwickshire, England. The village is on the A3400, about from Birmingham, about south of Henley-in-Arden and about north of Stratford-upon-Avon. The soil is a strong clay and some arable crops are grown, but the land is mainly in pasture. The common fields were inclosed in 1776, but some inclosures had already been made about 1623. The scenery is wooded and undulating, rising from about , in the south to , in the north-west at College Farm, above Forde Hall. Near here is Mockley Wood, which, with May's Wood in the centre of the parish and Austy Wood near Edstone, is one of the larger blocks of woodland. The older part of the village straddling the A3400 is designated as a Conservation Area because of its open, rural character and many historic buildings. ==History== The toponym \\"Wootton Wawen\\" means \\"farm near a wood, belonging to Wagen\\". Wagen or Waga is an Old Norse name. The oldest surviving record of Wootton is from when √Üthelbald, King of the Mercians, gave to the Earl Aethilric 20 hides of land for a minster between the years 723 and 737. The first wooden church was built at Wootton as a direct result of this charter of land, (about ) on which to build a monastery or minster of Saint Mary. The first church may have been burnt and pillaged by Viking invaders, but between about 970 and 1040, Wagen, an Anglo-Danish landowner, established the present church. This land was in the district of the Stoppingas near the river Aeluuinnae, now called the Alne. The Domesday Book records, \\"in Pathlow Hundred in Wotton (Wawen) 7 hides. Land for 9 ploughs. 23 villagers with a priest and 22 smallholders who have 6 ploughs. 2 mills at 11s and 8 sticks of eels; woodland 2 leagues long and one league wide. Value ¬£4. Waga held it freely.\\" Waga was one of the witnesses to Earl Leofric's foundation of the monastery at Coventry in the first year of the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042‚Äì43). His lands extended beyond those at Wootton Wawen, but, after the Norman conquest of England, Wootton was bestowed by the Conqueror on Robert de Stafford, descended from the de Tonei family and who had fought stoutly with Duke William against King Harold. He made Stafford Castle his principal seat and took his surname thence. Charles II passed through Wootton on his travels while escaping from England after the Battle of Worcester. Here, the king, disguised as the man-servant of the daughter of one of his supporters, Jane Lane, met with a party of Parliamentarian troopers: > before we came to Stradford upon Avon we espied upon the way a Troop of > Horse whose riders were alighted, and the Horses eateing some grass by the > wayside, staying there (as I thought) while their Muster-Maister was > provideing their Quarters; Mrs Lanes Sisters Husband (who went along as far > as Stradford) seeing this Troop of Horse just in our way, sayd that for his > part he would not goe by them, for he had once or twice been beaten by some > of the Parliament Soldiers, and he would not run the venture again. I > heareing him say soe begged Mrs Lane softly in her Eare that we might not > turne back but goe on, for that Enemy would certainly send after us to > enquire who we were if they should see us turne. But all she could say in > the world would not doe, but her Brother in law turned quite round and went > to Stradford another way the troop of Horse being there just getting on > Horse-back about twice 12 score off, and I told her we did meete the Troop > just but in the Towne of Stradford. ==Economy== Wootton Wawen has always been primarily a farming settlement, but over the centuries industrial activity has included milling; two mills are mentioned in the Domesday Book. Early in the 19th century there was a mill used for papermaking, as it probably was a century earlier ‚Äì a reference to William Martin, \\"paperman\\" of Wootton, occurring in 1717 ‚Äì but there has also been a fulling-mill for the production of hemp and flax on Wootton Green, and a dyehouse at nearby Blue Hole. There was also a hurdle-making industry in the village for a time. Today the area is largely agricultural with many residents commuting to nearby cities for employment. ==Governance== Wootton Wawen is part of the Henley ward of Stratford on Avon District Council and represented by Councillors Jem Jones and Stephen Thirlwell, Conservative Party . Nationally it is part of Stratford-on-Avon constituency, whose Member of Parliament since the 2010 election is Nadhim Zahawi of the Conservative Party. It was included in the West Midlands electoral region of the European Parliament. ==Parish church== St Peter's church from the south-east The Church of England parish church of Saint Peter is notable for having the most pronounced Anglo-Saxon work in the county. It is the oldest church in Warwickshire, although much of the present fabric is later. It comprises a chancel with a south chapel, nave, South aisle and on the North the tower embattled and pinnacled. There are also North and South porches the east jamb of the south porch has several votive crosses scored into it. The base of the tower and the first two stages are Saxon with four doorways, the top of the tower is 15th century as are the clerestory, the nave battlements, the north doorway and porch, the middle arch of the arcade, the west window with busts of a king and queen and the east window with a leaf frieze. The tower is the earliest part of the church, preserved in the middle despite restricting views of the chancel from the nave here, is the current site of the altar. The font is an octagonal bowl resting on eight sculptured heads similar to others in the county at Snitterfield and Lapworth. The old oak pulpit and choir screen is 15th century. The church has a small chained library of 17th-century theological works and some notable monumental brasses particularly the altar tomb of John Harewell and his wife Anna (1505). ===Bells=== The tower has a ring of six bells. The second bell was cast in 1591 by a member of the Watts family of bellfounders of Leicester. The tenor bell was cast in 1719 by Richard Sanders of Bromsgrove. The fourth bell was cast in 1784 by Charles and John Rudhall of Gloucester and the third bell was cast in 1803 by John Rudhall of Gloucester. The treble bell was cast in 1742 by Henry Bagley of Chacombe and the fifth was cast in 1761 by Thomas Rudhall of Gloucester. For a long time the treble was cracked and bolted with iron and then from 1911 the fifth was bound with an iron band around the inscription. The latter repair was by Thomas Bond of Burford, Oxfordshire who at the same time re-hung all six bells. Then in 1955 the two damaged bells were recast by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough, who at the same time tuned the other bells and re-hung all six again. All canons have been removed and replaced with bolted iron joists for ringing. The 16th-century oak frame with pits for three bells still exists: the posts have moulded corbelling at the tops and are strengthened by curved struts. It has been altered to take four bells, the treble and second being hung to the north of it. ===Clergy=== The vicar at the time of the Puritan Survei of the Ministrie in Warwickshire of 1586 was described as mascall (John Mascall 1580‚Äì1642) > vicar a precher thogh he be growen Idle negligent & slouthfull. a man > defamed & of tainted life he hath two charges beside Wooton videlicet, > Henley & Ownall (Ullenhall) he supplieth by his hirelinges : whereof one > vpon a rumor of change of religion in mounsiers daies did shave his > beard.(Indicative of a reversion to Catholicism) Value xl yearlie.

This ground still cannot be disturbed. ==Priory== Not long after the Norman Conquest, Robert de Stafford gave the church of Wootton with a hide of land nearby and another hide at \\"Doversele\\" to the Benedictine Abbey of St Peter de Castellion of Conches in Normandy which had been established in 1035 by his father, Roger de Tonei. They established a small alien priory here: a prior and one monk constituted its community and the church was re-dedicated to St Peter ad Vincula. In 1398 Richard II gave the priory to the Carthusians at Coventry, but the grant was reversed soon after by Henry IV and the monks re-established. It was bestowed with all its possessions on 12 December 1443 upon the Provost and Scholars of King's College, Cambridge, and on 30 November 1447 the Abbey of Conches released all title to the Priory to the college, in whose hands the manor still remains. No trace of the priory buildings remains but they stood between the churchyard and the ancient fishpond that is near the Henley Road. At the start of the reign of Edward I, Peter de Altaribus was prior. He became involved in a brawl which brought about the intervention of the bishop. The circumstances are related with considerable detail in the episcopal registers of Godfrey Giffard, Bishop of Worcester. An inquisition was held at Warwick on the Tuesday after Palm Sunday, 1281, to hear the dispute between Peter de Altaribus, and brother Roger his monk. William the vicar of Wootton, had been summoned to the priory to stop the brawl, and on arrival he met the prior coming out of the hall door whilst inside he found brother Roger sitting in a chair with his nose bleeding. The prior accused Roger of wounding himself in his nose with his own finger; whereas Roger claimed the prior had hit him on the nose, which was corroborated by others who added that Roger did not return the blow. The argument was over Peter's withdrawal of distributions to the poor, lack of hospitality, wasting the priory's goods, and drunkenness. Both were found guilty and excommunicated which after appeal they were absolved and recalled to the monastery of Conches, to receive punishment from their abbot. It is exceptional to find an alien priory subject to diocesan visitation, but this small priory was also visited by Bishop Giffard in 1269, 1284, and 1290. ==Historic secular buildings== Between the mill and the church is Wootton Hall, a large stone building in the Palladian style, mainly built in 1687 but incorporating parts of an earlier, probably Elizabethan, house. It was originally the home of the Carington family. Outbuildings behind the house are possibly the remains of the earlier manor-house. At the end of the Second World War the Hall was in a dilapidated condition and threatened with demolition but was bought in 1958 by Bill Allen, of Allen's Caravans, who developed the grounds into a mobile home park. This development rescued and restored the Hall and revitalised the community.

Inside are wide fireplaces, one with a lintel inscribed M 1697 TH, and open-timbered ceilings, however there is a stone giving the date of the building as 1317. Three of the buildings north of it on the same side, and The Cottage, facing the south end of the village street, have remains of 17th- century timber framing. In a short lane south of the church is the old Workhouse, now a dwelling-house; it is a small timber framed building covered with rough-cast cement and has a gabled north end with a jettied upper storey. The Manor Farm, at the north end of the village, is built of early-18th- century brick, but the chimneystack of diagonal shafts looks earlier. The west front, slightly recessed between gabled cross-wings, has a doorway with a semi-domical hood carved with palm leaves and a basket of fruit and flowers.

Regular bus services on this road provide transport to Birmingham and Stratford-upon Avon. The Birmingham and Stratford-upon-Avon Canal crosses the parish, leaving it near Silesbourne Farm, close to which there was a hermitage, mentioned in 1428 and 1470. The canal is carried over the main Stratford to Birmingham road by a cast-iron aqueduct bearing the date 1813. There are moorings and a canal boat marina in Wootton Wawen Basin. The canal was built by William James of Henley-in-Arden, who was later a pioneer of the railway system. A cast-iron plaque on the aqueduct records details of the building of the canal. The Monarch's Way, a long distance footpath which approximates to the escape route taken by Charles II in 1651 after his defeat in the Battle of Worcester, passes through Wootton Wawen. Wootton Wawen railway station was opened in 1908 on a branch of the Great Western Railway. The route is now the Birmingham to Stratford Line. The line south of Stratford upon Avon railway station continued as the Honeybourne Line to Honeybourne railway station (which is on the Cotswold Line) and onwards to Cheltenham. ==Filmography== The village was referenced in the Yes Minister episode The Right to Know. In that episode, Humphrey Appleby revealed that Hayward's Spinney, supposedly the site of a threatened badger colony, was actually just a rubbish dump used by the people of Wootton Wawen,Yes Minister Series 1 Episode 6, The Right to Know; first broadcast 31 March 1980 which differs from the published version where Sir Humphrey says it is used by the people of Birmingham. ==Notable residents== In the Second World War the Russian composer Nikolai Medtner and his wife lived in a secluded house outside Wootton Wawen, where he completed his Piano Concerto No. 3. Author Bill Watkins spent much of his youth in Wootton Wawen; his book A Celtic Childhood records his childhood adventures in and around the village during the 1950s. ==References== ==External links== * *History of Wootton Hall and its 'Secret Tunnel' Category:Civil parishes in Warwickshire Category:Villages in Warwickshire ","title":"Wootton Wawen"},{"id":"1426654","text":"Andrzej Potocki (1618-1663) was a Polish noble.

Westerleigh occupies high ground on Staten Island. While not as high as Todt Hill (the city's tallest point), from certain vantage points Westerleigh affords views of Newark, New Jersey, and farther afield on a clear day. The neighborhood has an abundance of coniferous and deciduous trees; including acacia, blue spruce, cedar, chestnut, elm, honey locust, paulownia, pin and royal oak, sweet gum, sycamore, tulip poplar, yew and many types of pine, some of which reach 75 feet (23 m) or more in height. On the neighborhood's southern side near the Staten Island Expressway is Ingram Woods, a remnant of a larger forest that has been preserved as an undeveloped park. ==History== House built in 1730 Westerleigh attracted notice when a temperance group, the National Prohibition Campground Association, bought 25 acres (10 ha) of land there in 1877, and named the property Prohibition Park ‚Äî noted chiefly today for the fact that the official climate records for Staten Island are compiled at the site. Many of the local streets are named after early leaders of the Prohibition movement (Neal Dow, Clinton B. Fisk), or for states that supported anti-liquor laws (such as Maine and Ohio). Some of Westerleigh's earliest residents excelled in letters, including Isaac K. Funk, co-founder of Funk and Wagnalls, and poet Edwin Markham. Heiress Amy Vanderbilt also once lived there. The neighborhood gained much local attention for the abundance of patriotic decorations festooned on its homes in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks. One of the oldest Boy Scouts of America groups, Troop #2, was formed in 1912 and operates out of the Immanuel Union Church on Jewett Avenue. Westerleigh is also home to the oldest tennis club in the US, tennis having been introduced to the US (from England, via Bermuda) at the home here of Mary Ewing Outerbridge. She played the first game in the US at the Staten Island Cricket Club on an hourglass shaped court. The location, on College Avenue, still sports a tennis court. The Peter Houseman House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==Education== Public School No. 30, Westerleigh, early 20th century ===Schools=== Many Westerleigh residents are zoned for PS 30, IS 51, Susan E. Wagner High School and Port Richmond High School. ===Library=== The New York Public Library (NYPL)'s Todt Hill- Westerleigh branch is located at 2550 Victory Boulevard on the border between Willowbrook and Westerleigh. The three-story branch opened in 1991. ==Transportation== Westerleigh is served by a number of local and express buses. The local bus and the express buses to Manhattan run along Watchogue Road. The local buses travel along Victory Boulevard, while the local bus travels along Jewett Avenue. Farther north, the local buses and the express buses serve Forest Avenue, and the SIM35 also serve Manor Road at Westerleigh's eastern edge. ==References== Category:Neighborhoods in Staten Island ","title":"Westerleigh, Staten Island"},{"id":"1426669","text":"Placentia Bay () is a body of water on the southeast coast of Newfoundland, Canada. It is formed by Burin Peninsula on the west and Avalon Peninsula on the east. Fishing grounds in the bay were used by native people long before the first European fishermen arrived in the 16th century. For a time, the French controlled the bay. They built their capital at Placentia on the east coast. The British gained Placentia during the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The town and nearby Castle Hill are national historic sites. English settlement followed in the bay and today the main communities are Burin, Marystown, and Placentia. On 14 August 1941 US Naval Station Argentia located in Little Placentia Sound was the site of the Atlantic Conference for the Atlantic Charter, where Winston Churchill and Franklin D.

Notable events at the site include the first successful V-2 launch on 3 October 1942, visits by German military leaders, and Allied reconnaissance overflights and bombing. ==Description== Two distinguishing features of P-7 were the 670-yard-long elliptical high-sloped sand wall and the wide concrete-lined trench (flame pit) with a large symmetrical water- cooled flame deflector of molybdenum-steel pipes. The concrete trench, nearly wide with concrete walls, sloped gradually away from each side of the flame deflector to a depth of , rising again symmetrically toward the side of the arena. Beside the flame pit was a long underground room where diameter delivery pipes were housed to route cooling water at 120 gallon per second from three huge pumps in the pumphouse to the flame deflector in the pit. While the elliptical sand wall was for blocking high sea winds and blown sand, concrete structures were integrated into the wall and under the ground to protect equipment and personnel from rocket explosions and enemy bombing (a sand-filled dummy warhead, called \\"the elephant\\", was normally used). A large gap in the wall allowed easy entry by vehicles (particularly railcars with propellants), and an open tunnel through the ellipse wall at the narrower southern end also allowed entry. Integrated into the ellipse wall next to the tunnel was a massive observation and measuring blockhouse containing the control center. The control center had a double door with a bulletproof glass window from which an observer maintained telephone communication with the Telemetering Building at a remote location from P-7. A receiver in a lighthouse near Koserow provided telemetry from rockets with the Wolman System :: For automatic motor cutoff, in 1940-1941 Professor Wolman of Dresden created an alternative of his tracking system to use a ground signal transponded by the A-4 to measure the velocity of the missile and, by triangulating from multiple sites, determined the trajectory. for Doppler tracking. For rockets that used radio control for V-2 engine cutoff, the Brennschluss equipment included a transmitter on the bank of the Peene about from P-7 and the Doppler radar at Lubmin (a motorized W√ºrzburg radar, the \\"rhinoceros\\"). ===Control room=== The control room also had switchboards, a row of four periscopes, manometers, frequency gauges, voltmeters and ammeters, green/red/white signal lamps, and switches at the propulsion console and guidance panel to dynamically display approximately 15 measurement points within the rocket. Additionally, the control room had a big \\"X-time\\" countdown clock that display the time until launch, which was announced via loudspeakers as \\"X minus four minutes\\", etc. In addition to the control room, the blockhouse also contained offices, a conference room, a small dormitory with double bunks and an adjoining shower, a wash room, and a workshop. A long underground corridor led from the measurement blockhouse to a room in the concrete foundation by the flame pit, and multiple rows of measurement cables covered the walls of the tunnel. A different gradually rising tunnel led from the long flame pit room to the exterior of the arena near the pumphouse (). Near the pumphouse were high wooden towers to cool the water, and high tanks for the recooling water were integrated into the ellipse wall. ===Test tower=== The prominent tower within the arena was a mobile test frame/crane (Fahrbare Kranb√ºhne) which could be moved over the flame pit to position the rocket nozzle 25 feet above the deflector, and which allowed an entire missile to be gimbaled in two directions up to five degrees from vertical. The tower included an elevator and a German-made Toledo scale for thrust measurements. Actual launches were from a steel table-like structure (firing stand, Brennstand) across the railway from the flame pit on the test stand's large concrete foundation. Under the concrete foundation were the recorder room, a small shop, an office, compressed nitrogen storage cylinders, and catch tanks. The arena also included an engine cold-calibration pad for conducting flow test measurements by pumping water (instead of Liquid oxygen) and alcohol (which was recovered afterward) via the turbopump through the combustion chamber. Since the V-2 motor had no controller for the turbopump, cold- calibration allowed the determination of \\"freak cases\\" of equipment. ===Hangar=== 12 June 1943 RAF reconnaissance photo of Test Stand VII Outside of the arena was the 150x185x100h foot assembly and preparation hall/hangar (), which had been designed to be able to handle a larger A9/A10 multi-stage rocket that was planned, but never built. The roof of the hangar had camera stations for filming events. ==Allied reconnaissance and bombing== On 15 May 1942 after photographing German destroyers berthed at the port of Kiel, Spitfire pilot Flight Lieutenant D. W. Stevenson photographed 'heavy construction work' near the Peenem√ºnde aerodrome. Later in the month Constance Babington Smith decided the scale was too small ... then something unusual caught my eye ... some extraordinary circular embankments ... I then dismissed the whole thing from my mind. Then a year later on 22 April 1943, Bill White and Ron Prescott in RAF de Havilland Mosquito DZ473 were sent from Leuchars to photograph damage from Allied bombing at the Stettin railyards: \\"On leaving Stettin, we left our cameras running all down the north coast of Germany, and when the film was developed, it was found to contain pictures of Peenem√ºnde.\\" The Medmenham interpreters studied the elliptical earthworks (originally photographed in May 1942) and noticed an \\"object\\" long projecting from what was thought to be a service building, although it had mysteriously disappeared on the next frame. On 22 April 1943 a large cloud of steam was photographed near the embankments, which was later identified as coming from a rocket engine being test fired. Duncan Sandys' first photographic reconnaissance report on Peenem√ºnde was circulated on 29 April 1943, which identified that the lack of power-station activity (Germany had installed electrostatic dust and smoke removers on the power station near K√∂lpin) indicates that \\"The circular and elliptical constructions are probably for the testing of explosives and projectiles. ... In view of the above, it is clear that a heavy long-range rocket is not an immediate threat.\\" Then on 14 May, an \\"unusually high level of activity\\" was visible at \\"the Ellipse\\" on photos from two sorties on 14 May, which was the date the Reich Director of Manpower (Gauleiter Fritz Sauckel) was a distinguished visitor at a launch. The first solid evidence of the existence of a rocket came with a sortie (N/853) on 12 June, when a Spitfire flown by Sqn Ldr Gordon Hughes photographed Peenem√ºnde: one photograph included an object on a railway truck. Reginald Victor Jones identified the object on 18 June as \\"a whiteish [sic] cylinder about 35 feet long and 5 or so feet in diameter with a blueish nose and fins at the other end...I had found the rocket.\\" :: On 13 June, Dr Jones sent a note to Sandys and \\"two or three days later an addendum was added the report by from Sandys' interpreter, saying that an object was visible on the photograph without any mention that anyone but himself had found it. This experience certainly confirmed my impression that my help was being avoided.\\" After Operation Hydra bombed other areas of Peenem√ºnde in 1943, the P-7 blockhouse roof was reinforced, and in a 1944 raid, the blockhouse occupants suffered one injury when a periscope fell. (Hermann Weidner's Test Stand 8 was lost in the 1944 July and August raids). The last V-2 launch at Peenem√ºnde was in February 1945, and on 5 May 1945, the 2nd Belorussian Front under General Konstantin Rokossovsky captured the port of Swinem√ºnde and the Usedom island. Russian infantry under Major Anatole Vavilov stormed Peenem√ºnde and found it \\"75 per cent wreckage\\" (the research buildings and test stands had been demolished.) A former adjutant at Peenem√ºnde, Oberstleutnant Richard Rumsch√∂ttel, and his wife were killed during the attack, and Vavilov had orders to destroy the facility. == References == ==External links== Category:Peenem√ºnde Army Research Center and Airfield Category:German V-2 rocket facilities Category:Rocket launch sites in Germany Category:V-weapon subterranea Category:World War II sites in Germany Category:World War II sites of Nazi Germany Category:Military installations established in 1938 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1961 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Germany Category:Ruins in Germany Category:1938 establishments in Germany Category:1961 disestablishments in Germany Category:V-2 missile launch sites ","title":"Test Stand VII"},{"id":"1426689","text":"Pr√ºfstand VII is a 2002 German docudrama film directed by Robert Bramkamp, about the V-2 rocket and the rocket research in the Peenem√ºnde Army Research Center.

It was originally raised in 1921 as part of the British Indian Army, when six previously existing regiments were amalgamated to form six battalions of the 6th Rajputana Rifles. In 1945 the numeral designation was dropped from the title and in 1947 the regiment was transferred to the newly independent Indian Army. Since independence, the regiment has been involved in a number of conflicts against Pakistan, as well as contributing to the Custodian Force (India) in Korea under the aegis of the United Nations in 1953-54 and to the UN Mission to the Congo in 1962. As a rifle regiment it uses a bugle horn as its insignia, the same as the British Light Division, but unlike its British counterparts, the Rajputana Rifles march at the same march pace used in the Indian Army as a whole. ==Etymology== The name Rajputana Rifles is derived from northwest, and the word Rajputana (r√§j'p ät√§'n…ô), a historic region in northwest India that is roughly coextensive with the modern Indian state of Rajasthan, as well as small sections of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. It is based on the Sanskrit word Rajaputra, meaning \\"son of a king\\". The name Rajputana means \\"land of the Rajputs\\". The Aravalli Range crosses the southern part of the region from northeast to southwest. The northwestern part is largely the Thar desert, but to the southeast, the land is extremely fertile. Rajput tribal power rose here between the 7th and 13th centuries, and the princes resisted the early Muslim incursions, which began in the 11th century. Rajput power reached its peak in the early 16th century, but the area fell to the Mughals when Akbar captured the Chittor Fort in 1568. From their seat at Ajmer the Mughals ruled Rajputana until the early 18th century. The Marathas held feudatories in the region from c. 1750 to 1818, when it passed to Great Britain. The Rajput princely states came under British protection by treaties in the early 19th century; most of the area was formed into Rajasthan state in 1948. Under the British, Rajputana included more than 20 princely states, notably Bikaner, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur, and Ajmer. The internal autonomy of many of the states was guaranteed. The Rajputana Rifles recruit mainly from the Rajput and Jat community, and has an equal mix between Rajputs and Jats.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Army-rejects-calls-to-raise- new-units-based-on-caste-or-religion/articleshow/18248941.cms ==Lineage== The regiment's origins lie in the 18th century when the East India Company (HEIC) recruited Rajputs to protect its operations. The impressive performance of French local units which were composed of local recruits mixed with French officers, helped the HEIC to decide that it needed to do something similar. In January 1775, it raised its first local infantry units which included the 5th Battalion, Bombay Sepoys, which is considered to be the oldest rifle regiment of the Indian Army. The 5th Battalion was successively redesignated as 9th Battalion Bombay Sepoys in 1778; 2nd Battalion, 2nd Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry in 1796; 4th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry in 1824, and then 4th Regiment Native Infantry (Rifle Corps) in 1881.Britishempire.co.uk - 104th Wellesley's Rifles It thus became the first rifle regiment of the British Indian Army. In 1899 the battalion was once more renamed as 4th Regiment (1st Battalion Rifle Corps) Bombay Infantry and again in 1901 as 4th Bombay Rifles. In Kitchener's 1903 reorganisation of the Indian Army, 4th Bombay Rifles became 104th Wellesley's Rifles, to commemorate the fact that the regiment had been commanded in 1800 by Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington).Mackenzie 1951, p. 25. In the further re-organisation in 1921, six regiments were brought together to form six battalions of the 6th Rajputana Rifles Regiment: A painting depicting members of the Rajputanta Rifles, of all ranks and uniforms. c. 1911 *1st Battalion - 104th Wellesley's Rifles *2nd Battalion - 120th Rajputana Infantry *3rd Battalion - 122nd Rajputana Infantry *4th Battalion - 123rd Outram's Rifles *5th Battalion - 125th Napier's Rifles *10th (Training) Battalion - 13th Rajputs (The Shekhawati Regiment). *18th Battalion - (Saurashtra Rifles)Sharma 1990, pp. 104‚Äì105. In 1945 the regiments of the British Indian Army dropped the numeral in their titles and so the Rajputana Rifles assumed its current name. In 1947 after the partition of India the regiment was allocated to the newly formed Indian Army. In 1949, the 1st battalion was transferred to the newly raised Brigade of the Guards, becoming the 3rd battalion, Brigade of the Guards. ==History== Battle of Meiktila, Burma 1945 In 1817 the 4th battalion met the Marathas at the Battle of Khadki. The defence earned the regiment the battle honor of \\"Khadki\\". In 1856‚Äì57 the 1st, 2nd, and 4th battalions were together in the Persian theatre of operations. In 1856 Capt. John Augustus Wood of the 2nd battalion (then the 20th Bombay Native Infantry) was awarded the Victoria Cross for storming Bushire Fort.Sharma 1990, pp. 97‚Äì98. This was the first Victoria Cross to be won in an Indian unit.Mackenzie 1951, p. 131. Sub. Maj Mohammed Sharief and Sub. Peer Bhatt were recommended for the Victoria Cross for their actions in the same battle but were turned down as at that time the medal category was not open to Indians.Sharma 1990, p. 98.Until 1911, the Indian Order of Merit was the highest gallantry award that Indian soldiers were eligible for. After 1911, the Victoria Cross was extended to all soldiers of the British Empire. In 1878‚Äì1880, during the Second Afghan War, the 1st battalion marched 145 miles in 5 days from Quetta to Kandahar and laid siege to the city. In 1900‚Äì1902, the 3rd battalion was part of a force used to contain the Boxer Rebellion in China. World War I saw the regiment fight in battlefields from France to Palestine. The 5th battalion was in all theatres of the war and participated in General Allenby‚Äôs march to recapture Jerusalem.

A Toby Jug, also sometimes known as a Fillpot (or Philpot), is a pottery jug in the form of a seated person, or the head of a recognizable person. Typically the seated figure is a heavy-set, jovial man holding a mug of beer in one hand and a pipe of tobacco in the other and wearing 18th- century attire: a long coat and a tricorn hat. The tricorn hat forms a pouring spout, often with a removable lid, and a handle is attached at the rear. Jugs depicting just the head and shoulders of a figure are also referred to as Toby jugs, although these should strictly be called \\"character jugs\\" or face jugs, the wider historical term. The original Toby Jug, with a brown salt glaze, was developed and popularised by Staffordshire potters in the 1760s. It is thought to be a development of similar Delft jugs that were produced in the Netherlands.The Art of the Old English Potter, By Louis Marc Emmanuel Solon, Forgotten Books, September, 2015, p. 245, Similar designs were produced by other potteries, first in Staffordshire, then around England, and eventually in other countries. The Jug in the form of a Head, Self-portrait (1899) by Paul Gauguin is an unusual example from a painter. ==Etymology== There are competing theories for the origin of the name \\"Toby Jug\\". One is that it was named after the intoxicated, jovial character of Sir Toby Belch in Shakespeare's play Twelfth Night. Another is that it was named after a notorious 18th-century Yorkshire drinker, Henry Elwes, who was known as \\"Toby Fillpot\\" (or Philpot), who was mentioned in an old English drinking song The Brown Jug, the popular verses of which were first published in 1761. ==Cultural references== In the book and 1949 film Twelve O'Clock High a Toby Jug depicting Robin Hood is used as a signal in the officer's club, to discreetly warn aircrews that there will be a mission the following day, without revealing this to outsiders who might be visiting. The Toby Jug plays a pivotal role in the film. In the 2017 film Baobhan Sith Toby Jugs are used as weapons against the Baobhan Sith, a mythical Scottish demon. A Toby Jug, and a specialist collector and her large collection, also figure prominently in the plot of the Bravo/Netflix series Imposters. ==Collections== The American Toby Jug Museum is located on Chicago Avenue in Evanston, Illinois, US. ==ReferencesAmerican Toby Jug Museum Category:Liquid containers Category:Drinkware Category:Beer vessels and serving Category:Pottery ","title":"Toby Jug"},{"id":"1426709","text":"Saturnia pavonia, the small emperor moth, is a moth of the family Saturniidae. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. Sometimes, the incorrect genus name Pavonia is still used for this species. This moth occurs throughout the Palearctic region and is the only member of its family to be found in the British Isles, where it is usually called simply the emperor moth. ==Description== The male has a wingspan of about with brown and white forewings marked with red and orange fascia and a bold black and orange eyespot. The hindwings are orange with a similar eyespot. The female is larger with a wingspan of about , but less brightly coloured than the male, being generally grey and white but has all wings marked with eyespots similar to the male. The male flies rapidly during the day from mid-April to late June looking for the rather sluggish females, which usually only fly at night. The species inhabits a range of habitats but is most often associated with heathland and moorland. The caterpillar is black and orange at first, later becoming green with black rings and yellow and red spots. The commonest food plant is heather but the species has also been recorded feeding on a huge range of other plants (see list below). The species overwinters as a pupa within a fibrous cocoon. ==Subspecies== *Saturnia pavonia pavonia (southern Spain and possibly Morocco) *Saturnia pavonia josephinae (Schawerda, [1924]) (southern Spain and possibly Morocco) *Saturnia pavonia colombiana (Colombia and possibly Ecuador) 02 √©closion oeufs de Saturnia Pavonia 1991.jpgCaterpillars and eggs Saturnia pavonia- lu.jpgYounger caterpillar Caterpillar Emperor Moth Saturnia pavonia.jpgCaterpillar Saturnia pavonia-lp.jpgOlder caterpillar and the start of pupation Saturnia pavonia MHNT CUT 2011 0 439 male Les piles - Cornille (Dordogne).jpgBoth sides of male specimen Saturnia pavonia MHNT CUT 2011 0 439 female Mussidan.jpgBoth sides of female specimen == Recorded food plants == S. pavonia larvae have been recorded feeding on Alchemilla, Alnus, Arbutus, Betula, Calluna, Cornus, Crataegus, Erica, Fagus, Filipendula, Fragaria, Fraxinus, Hippophae, Humulus, Juglans, Lythrum, Malus, Myrica gale, Pistacia, Populus, Potentilla, Prunus, Pyrus, Quercus, Rhamnus, Rosa, Rubus, Rumex, Salix, Sambucus, Schinus, Sorbus, Spiraea, Ulmus, Vaccinium. == References == * Chinery, Michael.

It was one of the most important parties in Poland from its inception in 1892 until its dissolution in 1948. A party with the same name was established in 1987 but has remained at the margins of Polish politics. J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, founder of the Second Polish Republic, was a member and later leader of the PPS in the early 20th century. ==History== The PPS was founded in Paris in 1892 (see the Great Emigration). In 1893 the party called Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania, (SDKPiL), emerged from the PPS, with the PPS being more nationalist and oriented towards Polish independence, and the SDKPiL being more revolutionary and communist. In November 1892 the leading personalities of the PPS agreed on a political program. The program, largely progressive for the time of its creation, accented: *Independent Republic of Poland based on democratic principles *Direct universal voting rights *Equal rights for all nations living in Poland *Equal rights for all citizens, regardless of race, nationality, religion and gender *Freedom of press, speech and assembly *Progressive taxation *Eight-hour workday *Minimum wage *Equal wages for men and women *Ban on child labour (till age 14) *Free education *Social support in case of injury in the workplace After the Revolution of 1905 in the Russian Empire, the party membership drastically increased from several hundred active members to a mass movement of about 60,000 members. Another split in the party occurred in 1906, with the Revolutionary Faction following J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, who supported the nationalist and independence ideals, and the Left faction which allied itself with the SDKPiL. However, the Revolutionary Faction became dominant and renamed itself back again to the PPS, while the Left was eclipsed, and in 1918 merged with SDKPiL forming the Communist Party of Poland. In 1917-18 the party participated in the Central Council of Ukraine and the Government of Ukraine. During the Second Polish Republic the PPS at first supported J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, including his May Coup, but later moved into the opposition to his authoritarian Sanacja regime by joining the democratic 'centrolew' (center-left) opposition movement. Many PPS leaders and members were put on trial by Pi≈Çsudski's regime and jailed in the infamous Bereza Kartuska prison. The party was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1923 and 1940.Kowalski, Werner. Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 316 The party supported the Polish resistance during World War II as the underground Polish Socialist Party ‚Äì Freedom, Equality, Independence (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna ‚Äì Wolno≈õƒá, R√≥wno≈õƒá, Niepodleg≈Ço≈õƒá). In 1948 it suffered a fatal split, as the communists applied the salami tactics to dismember any opposition. One faction, which included Edward Os√≥bka-Morawski wanted to join forces with the Polish Peasant Party and form a united front against the Communists. Another faction, led by J√≥zef Cyrankiewicz, argued that the Socialists should support the Communists in carrying through a socialist program, while opposing the imposition of one- party rule. Pre-war political hostilities continued to influence events, and Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk, leader of the Peasant Party, would not agree to form a united front with the Socialists. The Communists played on these divisions by dismissing Os√≥bka-Morawski and making Cyrankiewicz Prime Minister. In 1948, Cyrankiewicz's faction of Socialists merged with the Communist Polish Workers' Party (PPR) to form the Polish United Workers' Party (Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza; PZPR), the ruling party in the People's Republic of Poland; remnants of the other faction survived on emigration in the Polish government- in-exile and because of that Polish Socialist Party was still active on emigration. Cyrankiewicz's faction isn't really treated as proper PPS. A new party of the same name, which seeks to carry on the tradition of the original PPS, was established by left-wing opposition figures such as Jan J√≥zef Lipski in 1987. However, the new PPS remains a marginal group within the political landscape of the Third Republic, having representation in the Sejm only between 1993 and 2001. However, in the 2019 Polish parliamentary election the PPS saw its leader Wojciech Konieczny elected to the Senate of Poland under the banner of The Left.Wnp.pl Its main propaganda outlet was the Robotnik ('The Worker') newspaper. The current party published the Nowy Robotnik (\\"The New Worker\\"), a continuation of the original publication, from 2003 to 2006. == Election results == === Sejm === { class= - !Year !Popular vote !% of vote !Seats !Seat change - !1919 515,062 9.2  n/a - !1922 906,537 10.3   6 - !1928 1,482,097 13.0   23 - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" 1930 1,965,864 17.3   41 -  colspan=4As part of the Centrolew coalition, which won 79 seats in total. - !1935 colspan=4 Boycotted - !1938 colspan=4 Boycotted - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" 1947 9,003,682 26.13 (#1)   116 -  colspan=\\"4\\" As part of the Democratic Bloc coalition, which won 394 seats in total. - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" 1991 230,975 2.1  n/a -  colspan=4As part of the Labour Solidarity coalition, which won 4 seats in total. - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" 1993 2,815,169 20.4   4 -  colspan=4As part of the Democratic Left Alliance coalition, which won 171 seats in total. - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" 1997 3,551,224 27.1   1 -  colspan=4As part of the Democratic Left Alliance coalition, which won 164 seats in total. - !2001 13,459 0.1   3 - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" 2005 91,266 0.8   0 -  colspan=4As part of the Polish Labour Party committee, which won no seats. - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" 2007 160,476 1.0   0 -  colspan=4As part of the Polish Labour Party committee, which won no seats. - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" 2015 1,147,102 7.6   0 -  colspan=4As part of the United Left coalition, which won no seats. - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" 2019 2,319,946 12.6   0 -  colspan=4As part of The Left coalition, which won 49 seats in total. } === Senate === { class= - !Year !Popular vote !% of vote !Seats !Seat change - !1922 468,147 8.4  n/a - !1928 715,556 11.2   3 - ! 1930  colspan=4As part of Centrolew coalition, which won 13 seats in total. - !1935 colspan=4 Boycotted - !1938 colspan=4 Boycotted - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" 1993 4,993,061 35.7   1 -  colspan=4As part of the Democratic Left Alliance coalition, which won 37 seats in total. - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" 1997 6,091,721 45.7   2 -  colspan=4As part of the Democratic Left Alliance coalition, which won 28 seats in total. - !2001 131,987 0.5   3 - !rowspan=\\"2\\" 2019 415,745 2.3   1 -  colspan=4As part of The Left coalition, which won 2 seats in total. } ===Presidential=== { class= - !colspan=\\"6\\" align=\\"center\\"Second Polish Republic - ! rowspan=2Election year ! rowspan=2Candidate ! colspan=21st round ! colspan=22nd round - ! votes ! % ! votes ! % - !1922 Ignacy Daszy≈Ñski 49 9.1 (#5) 1 0.2 (#5) - !1926 Supported J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski 292 60.2 (#1)  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:lightgrey;\\" - !1926 Zygmunt Marek 56 11.6 (#3) 1 0.2 (#3) } { class= - !colspan=\\"6\\" align=\\"center\\"Third Polish Republic - ! rowspan=2Election year ! rowspan=2Candidate ! colspan=21st round ! colspan=22nd round - ! # of overall votes ! % of overall vote ! # of overall votes ! % of overall vote - ! 1995  Supported Tadeusz Zieli≈Ñski  631,432  3.5 (#6)  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:lightgrey;\\" - ! 2000  Piotr Ikonowicz  38,672  0.2 (#10)  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:lightgrey;\\" - ! 2005  Supported Daniel Podrzycki  colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"background:lightgrey;\\" - ! 2020  Supported Robert Biedro≈Ñ  432,129  2.2 (#6)  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:lightgrey;\\" - } ===European Parliament=== { class= !Year !Popular vote !% of vote !Seats - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"2004  48,667  0.80  -  colspan=4As part of KPEiR-PLD coalition, which won no seats. - !2009 1,331 0.02  } ==Notable people who were members or were associated with PPS== ===Presidents and heads of state=== *J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski (former member at time in office) *Stanis≈Çaw Wojciechowski (former member) *Ignacy Mo≈õcicki (former member) *Stanis≈Çaw Ostrowski *Franciszek TrƒÖbalski ===Prime Ministers=== *Ignacy Daszy≈Ñski *Jƒôdrzej Moraczewski *Janusz Jƒôdrzejewicz (former member) *Walery S≈Çawek (former member) *Tomasz Arciszewski *Tadeusz Tomaszewski *Antoni PajƒÖk *Alfred Urba≈Ñski *Edward Os√≥bka-Morawski (later became a communist) *J√≥zef Cyrankiewicz (later became a communist) ===Other figures=== *Jan J√≥zef Lipski *Boles≈Çaw Limanowski *Adam Cio≈Çkosz * *Jerzy Czeszejko-Sochacki (later became a communist) *Norbert Barlicki *Piotr Ikonowicz *Wojciech Konieczny *Jan Kwapi≈Ñski *Herman Lieberman *Stanis≈Çaw Mendelson *Stanis≈Çaw Dubois * *Mieczys≈Çaw Niedzia≈Çkowski * * *Zofia Praussowa *Kazimierz Pu≈ºak *Kazimierz Sosnkowski * *Leon Wasilewski *Aleksandra Zag√≥rska ==See also== *List of Polish Socialist Party politicians *Central Rada == Notes == ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Political parties in Poland ","title":"Polish Socialist Party"},{"id":"1426734","text":"You You You on stage during their 1987 World Domination Tour. The Fridge was a nightclub in the Brixton area of South London, England, founded by Andrew Czezowski and Susan Carrington, who had run the Roxy during punk music's heyday in 1977. It was originally started in 1981, in a small club at 390 Brixton Rd, and in 1982 above Iceland in Brixton Road with a radical decor that included beat-up ice boxes and artificial dead cats hanging from its ceiling. Early guest DJs included Keith Barker-Main, later a lifestyle journalist and social commentator. It claims to have been the first British club to have such innovations as video screens and a chill out lounge. The Fridge was at the heart of the early 80s New Romantic movement, and booked such acts as Eurythmics and the Pet Shop Boys before they were well known and drew famous faces such as Boy George, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Magenta Devine, as well as Marc Almond and Grace Jones, who also performed there. In 1984, as a result of increased popularity, the club moved to its final location: a converted 1913 cinema (The Palladium Picture House) formerly a roller-disco called the ACE on the Town Hall Parade. Joe Strummer from The Clash invested ¬£5,000 in the new club. Andrew explains during an interview for 3:AM magazine, \\"what the club achieved since then -- its visuals laid the template for the rave scene, it's a look that's being copied across the world. There's been no recognition of course -- if a record is influential it's on vinyl for all to hear throughout history, but you can't really encapsulate a visual in the same way, people just take it for granted. Basically the look of modern-day clubs was started here in 1986.\\" In July 1985, Andrew and Susan launched their own Record Company, Latex Records. located at the Fridge. Yvette the Conqueror was the first artist signed to the label. The labels first release was a single by Yvette the Conqueror titled, \\"The Boys Were There,\\" produced by Iain Williams (from the bands You You You and Big Bang. Andrew and Susan also promoted many bands at the Fridge, one of which was the cult club-band You You You featuring club promoter Laurence Malice, Karen O'Connor and Iain Williams. The band performed a sell-out concert at the Fridge on 27 March 1987, at which Andrew had a huge white staircase built on the stage for the band to perform on. The show was filmed for Japanese television. Since then it has hosted a variety of club nights most notably Daisy Chain (1987-1990) mostly dance music, trance and more recently mainly hard dance. The Fridge closed on 17 March 2010 and has no link with Electric Brixton which now occupies the building. Electric Brixton opened in September 2011.Famous music venue Fridge reopens as Electric Brixton, BBC News, 24 August 2011. ==Love Muscle== Launched in September 1992, Love Muscle instantly became one of the major gay club nights in London, running every Saturday night for almost a decade. Famous for its uplifting music policy, raunchy stage shows and unique party atmosphere, the night soon attained international renown, regularly attracting clubbers from across the country and beyond every weekend. Love Muscle's original DJs were Marc Andrews, Mark Monroe and Gareth, who defined the night's music policy of uplifting commercial house, and created a sound that was entirely unique to Love Muscle. They remained at the helm as weekly residents at the club for nearly 7 years, and were then joined and ultimately replaced by Mark O, Dorian, Rich B, Rich P and Sean Sirrs. During the early years and again towards the end, the club played host to drag queen Yvette (Ian Hunter-Meek b 1950), a former buyer for Harrods, who gave stage shows containing strippers and live music. During the period when Yvette (also known as Yvette the Conqueror) first hosted Love Muscle, Yvette, along with Laurence Malice (founder of Trade nightclub) were regarded as two of the most influential club hosts in London. After Yvette left the Fridge, Paul Bakalite hosted Love Muscle for a while (1995/96) and is remembered for his affable persona, meeting and greeting patrons in the Fridge foyer and handing out lollipops and novelties to sweaty revellers. Due to falling numbers and the occasional drugs raid, the night was temporarily closed in 1998, but was soon brought back due to public demand. It never fully recovered however, and became increasingly infrequent during the period 2000‚Äì2002. The night was finally closed (ostensibly for good) in 2004. Love Muscle returned to the Fridge on 31 December 2008 with the original promoter Andrew Czezowski and the exhilarating pyrotechnics and production effects the night was renowned for. The night's name, Love Muscle, is a euphemism for the penis, reflecting its raunchy gay appeal. ==Return To The Source and Escape From Samsara== During the mid '90s, Friday nights were turned over to outside promoters playing trance music, with a different one taking each of the four Fridays of the month:- *1st Friday - Otherworld *2nd Friday - Return to the Source *3rd Friday - Escape from Samsara *last Friday - Science Fiction (If a month had five Fridays the \\"spare\\" one was allocated to a promoter, sometimes Pendragon who played a similar range of music to Escape from Samsara. Pendragon's parties at the Fridge were usually one-off events since their regular venue was the Theatre Factory warehouse at Tyssen Street in Dalston.) Of the four usual Friday promotions the two most popular and successful nights were Return To The Source and Escape From Samsara, playing mainly hard trance including very fast Goa trance. It is reckoned that these nights were among the first in the UK to feature what then became the trance music phenomenon. Escape from Samsara - the name being a reference to the Hindu concept of Sa·πÉsƒÅra - held its first event at The Fridge on 15 September 1995. Formed from the club Megatripolis, they also held occasional events at the Brixton Academy & Bagleys in London; Spain, Morocco, Germany, Czech Republic, Egypt, Israel and Australia. The resident DJs at their events were Beamish and Oberon and there was usually a live performance by an electronic music artist or group, the most frequent appearances being by Cybernaut, Lab 4, The Secret and Audio Pancake. The upstairs balcony area was home to a market which sold fluoro clothing accessories, chai tea, etc. Also noteworthy is the admission and pricing policy where clubbers paid only ¬£3 for entry (compared to the standard price of ¬£10 or more) if they brought a \\"drum or didge\\", thus encouraging punters to contribute musically and supporting those who could not afford the full price. Escape From Samsara then went on to run every Friday night for a number of years at The Fridge with DJs such at Rubec, Tim Samsara, Darren Shambhala, Chris Liberator, Mark EG, Blu Peter and Mark Sinclair all playing behind the decks. Escape From Samsara became a world-renowned brand that was known for its extraordinary friendly ambience, non profit ethos, whacky performers, free bananas at the end of the night, stunning decorations, giant balloons, confetti drops and pyrotechnic shows. For many it was an introduction into an alternative lifestyle. Like Escape from Samsara, Return to the Source also held occasional events at other venues such as the Brixton Academy and Bagleys. They booked a range of psy-trance DJ's (or \\"deck wizards\\" as they were listed on the flyers) with the resident DJ being Mark Allen. The resident at Science Fiction was Sid Shanti and at Otherworld they were Lol and Yazz. Return to the Source and Science Fiction both relocated to different London venues in May 1997, moving to Bagleys in Kings Cross and Cloud 9 in Vauxhall respectively. Thereafter, Escape from Samsara was held every Friday at The Fridge. Although all the nights at The Fridge welcomed anyone, the Friday nights were aimed primarily at the straight community in contrast to Love Muscle which was promoted as a gay night. The Fridge Bar, located next- door to The Fridge, was typically used to host an afterparty on Saturday mornings, with DJs playing music to the small basement dancefloor. A hand- stamp allowed paying punters to come and go freely, some choosing to spend part of the morning in the Peace Gardens park situated immediately opposite the venue. ==Album releases== An embodiment of The Fridge's most revered night \\"Africa Centre\\" was released as a compilation album in 2003, mixed by Jazzie B of Soul II Soul. Escape from Samsara released a total of three unmixed compilation albums between 1996 and 1999. The group Zen Terrorists and solo artist SBL (Silicon Based Life) also both later released \\"Live at Escape from Samsara\\" albums. The second CD of the debut album by Lab 4 consisted of a live set recorded at Escape from Samsara at the Fridge, too. Return to the Source released a number of compilation albums and a few singles on their label of the same name.

As a child, he had a cloak made of rabbit skin and thus received the nickname \\"Bunny\\", by which he was known to friends and intimates all his life. ==Early life== Garnett was born in Brighton, East Sussex, the only child of writer, critic and publisher Edward Garnett and his wife Constance Clara Black, a translator of Russian. His paternal grandfather and great-grandfather both worked at what is now the British Library, then within the British Museum. As a conscientious objector in the First World War, Garnett worked on fruit farms in Suffolk and Sussex with his lover Duncan Grant. ==Work== A prominent member of the Bloomsbury Group, Garnett received literary recognition when his novel Lady into Fox, an allegorical fantasy,John Clute Lady into Fox, in Frank N. Magill (ed.), Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature, Vol 2. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983, pp. 863‚Äì866. was awarded the 1922 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. He ran a bookshop near the British Museum with Francis Birrell during the 1920s. He also founded (with Francis Meynell) the Nonesuch Press. He wrote the novel Aspects of Love (1955), on which the later Andrew Lloyd Webber musical of the same name was based. ==Personal life== His first wife was the illustrator Rachel \\"Ray\\" Marshall (1891‚Äì1940), sister of the translator and diarist Frances Partridge. He and Ray, whose woodcuts appear in some of Garnett's books, had two sons, the older of which was Richard Garnett (1923‚Äì2013), the writer.Nicholas Barker, \\"Richard Garnett: Typographer, editor and writer who grew up amid the Bloomsbury group\\" (obituary), The Independent, 5 June 2013. Ray died relatively young of breast cancer. Garnett was bisexual, as were several members of the artistic and literary Bloomsbury Group, and he had affairs with Francis Birrell and Duncan Grant. On 25 December 1918 he was present at the birth of Grant's daughter by Vanessa Bell, Angelica, who was accepted by Vanessa's husband Clive Bell. Shortly afterwards he wrote to a friend: \\"I think of marrying it. When she is 20, I shall be 46 ‚Äì will it be scandalous?\\" On 8 May 1942, when Angelica was in her early twenties, they did marry, to the horror of her parents. She did not find out until much later that her husband had been a lover of her father. The Garnetts lived at Hilton Hall, near St Ives in Huntingdonshire, where David Garnett kept a herd of Jersey cows.Liz Hodgkinson, \\"Poisoned Legacy of the Bloomsbury Group\\", Daily Mail, May 2012. They had four daughters: in order, Amaryllis, Henrietta, and the twins Nerissa and Frances; eventually the couple separated. Amaryllis Virginia Garnett (1943‚Äì1973) was an actress who had a small part in Harold Pinter's film adaptation of The Go-Between (1970). She drowned in the Thames, aged 29. Henrietta Garnett married Lytton Burgo Partridge, her father's nephew by his first wife Ray, but was left a widow with a newborn infant when she was 18;Adam Kuper, Incest and Influence: The Private Life of Bourgeois England, Harvard University Press, 2009, p. 242, . she oversaw the legacies of both David Garnett and Duncan Grant. Nerissa Garnett (1946‚Äì2004) was an artist, ceramicist, and photographer. Fanny (Frances) Garnett moved to France where she became a farmer. ==Later life== After his separation from Angelica, Garnett moved to France and lived in the grounds at the Ch√¢teau de Charry, Montcuq (near Cahors), in a house leased to him by the owners, Jo and Angela d'Urville.Sarah Knights (2015), Bloomsbury's Outsider: A Life of David Garnett, Bloomsbury Reader (632 pp.), p. 509. .

Until 1945 Kummersdorf hosted the weapon office of the German Army which ran a development centre for future weapons as well as an artillery range. ==Early history== In 1871, the Prussian ministry of war decided to move the artillery test range at Tegel to the Kummersdorf Forest. The new range became operational on 15 October 1875 when it was connected with the Royal Prussian Military Railway. In 1880, the first firing experiments took place on the 12 km southeast-northwest firing range. These experiments investigated the effectiveness of various fortifications, and the effects of weapons and projectiles. Total size of the Kummersdorf Firing Range was 878.1 hectares. In 1913, the dropping of bombs from the LZ 13 Hansa airship and Wright biplanes was investigated. In the 1920s, secret development started in the areas of artillery, armored forces, motor vehicles, signals technology and aviation. On 21 September 1933, Hitler visited for the first time. ==Aircraft and rocket history== In 1929, the German Minister of National Defense undertook research into the use of rocket propulsion for military purposes, and responsibility for rocket development was assigned to the Ballistics Branch of the Army Weapons Department. Walter Dornberger joined that branch in 1930. They built a test stand for liquid-propellant rockets, Experimental Station West, at Kummersdorf in December 1932. Dornberger, Walter Riedel, and Wernher von Braun tested their first rocket motor on 21 December, using liquid oxygen and 75% ethyl alcohol. Arthur Rudolph joined the organization, and work started on the Aggregate 1 (A-1), which was to be a complete missile, but then development moved on to the A-2. They used a wind tunnel to determine stable flight configurations, starting from zero through to supersonic speeds. In December 1934, the first two A2s where successfully launched from the North Sea island of Borkum. The first casualties in rocket development occurred in March 1934, when Dr. Wahmke and 2 assistants were killed, and another assistant was injured. A propellant fuel tank exploded, while experimenting with mixing 90% hydrogen peroxide and alcohol, before combustion. In 1935, work commenced on using rocket motors to power aircraft. In 1936, a rocket motor was installed in tail of a Heinkel He 112, with 90 seconds worth of fuel. Flight tests (now also supported by the Luftwaffe) were carried out at Neuhardenberg (a large field about 70 kilometres east of Berlin, listed as a reserve airfield in the event of war). On 3 June 1937 the Heinkel He 112 was flown by test pilot Erich Warsitz, propelled by rocket power alone. Despite the wheels-up landing and having the fuselage on fire due to an unpredicted area of low aerodynamic pressure drawing alcohol fumes back into the airframe which then ignited.Neufeld, Michael J., \\"The Rocket and the Reich: Peenem√ºnde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile,\\" Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1996, Library of Congress card number 94-30088, , pages 58-59. In May 1937, Dornberger, and most of his staff, moved to Peenem√ºnde on the island of Usedom on the Baltic coast which offered much greater space and secrecy. Dr. Thiel and his staff followed in the summer of 1940. Test Stand VI at Pennem√ºnde was an exact replica to Kummersdorf's large test stand. Hitler visited Kummersdorf West in March 1939, accompanied by Walther von Brauchitsch, witnessing the test firing of the 650 and 2200 pound thrust rocket motors, and viewed components of the A-3 and A-5. He also enquired how long it would take to develop the A-4. Hitler was skeptical of the rocket's potential. After 1938 Kummersdorf was used for nuclear research. ==Armored fighting vehicle history== Kummersdorf was also the location for the analyses, studies and testing of various German-captured Allied tanks and armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs). Many tanks from all combat-fronts, from North Africa to the Eastern Front, were tested there, with American tanks being multiple variant-models of the M4 Sherman tank, the M3 Lee, the M10 tank destroyer, amongst several others, and Soviet tanks consisting of the T-34 (the mainstay of Soviet armoured forces) and the T-28 medium tanks, the SU-series of self- propelled artillery/guns (such as the SU-85) and the IS-2 heavy tank, just to list a few. There were also British tanks there, including a Churchill tank fitted with a Y-shaped exhaust outlet (an early variant-model of the Churchill) for deep-wading and amphibious operations which was used at the Dieppe Raid, along with many Matilda I and Matilda II infantry tanks (with the former being largely seized following the evacuation of Allied troops at Dunkirk and the latter from both Dunkirk as well as in North Africa). There were also many French tanks there as well, such as the Char B1 heavy tank. Also, an Italian Carro Armato P40 heavy tank was present at Kummersdorf. The Wehrmacht also tested new German tanks there, including the VK 4501 (P) (the losing Porsche-hulled competitor for the Tiger I production contract), the Hetzer tank destroyer, the Panzer V Panther medium tank, the Tiger II heavy tank, possibly the VK 4502 (P), and the 188-tonne Panzerkampfwagen Maus super- heavy tank. Albert Speer refers to the tanks testing station at Kummersdorf during the 1942 offensive against the Soviet Union. The station showed that the treads or motor of a heavy tank need repairs every 400-500 miles. This was a limiting factor in the offensive as supply lines became stretched and spare parts carried by the tanks were consumed. In late 1944, a unit was formed, and at a meeting in the Fuhrer's headquarters it was referred to as tank company \\"Kummersdorf\\". This unit consisted of three tank platoons (mostly still mobile), one recon platoon of armored vehicles, an infantry (Grenadier) platoon and one tank platoon, consisting of a Tiger II, a single Jagdtiger heavy tank destroyer, two American Shermans, the Carro Armato P 40 Heavy Tank and several Borgward IVs armed with machine guns. According to a Telex on April 4, 1945, at least part of a tank company should have been transferred to the district of Dresden. Non-mobile equipment, including a VK 4501 (P) took part in combat south-east of Kummersdorf, where they and workers, civilians and other people at the facility were thrown together to make a makeshift grenadier unit. By the battles end, the VK 4501 (P) had destroyed a single T-34 and the Grenadiers had destroyed several others, a nearby 88 mm (8.8 cm) flak gun destroyed another advancing T-34. The entire unit failed in their mission and dispersed into the nearby woods. Another tank unit was formed at Kummersdorf and participated in combat on April 21, 1945. The fighting took place to the south in the direction of Baruth, with the objective of stopping the 1st Ukrainian Front, coming from the direction of Gol√üen. Joining up with Battle Group K√§ther with 43 vehicles, including one Panzer V Panther. During the fighting near the settlement of Baruth, the entire unit was destroyed by the Russian forces. The fate of the tanks left at the facility is unknown, though some information suggests that several American made tanks were sent to Panzer Brigade 150, being used in Operation Greif. A T-35 Heavy Tank became a member of Combat Group Ritter, who fought in the area of Zossen, it was quickly knocked out in combat. It is also believed that a Renault Char D2 saw combat in the Zossen area. There is also a photo of knocked out British Cruiser tanks sitting next to a knocked out Panther, which was taken on the outskirts of Berlin, these were believed to be from Kummersdorf. On March 9, 1945 the commander of Army Group Vistula signed the order for all tanks still at Kummersdorf to be sent away in parts to the occupying defences around Szczecin. What became of these tanks is still unknown. ==See also== *Walter Dornberger *Erich Warsitz *Peenem√ºnde *Usedom *Aggregate 1 *Maus Tank *Berlin *Operation Greif ==References== ==Bibliography== * Lutz Warsitz: THE FIRST JET PILOT - The Story of German Test Pilot Erich Warsitz, Pen and Sword Books Ltd., England, 2009, , ==External links== *Kummersdorf entry in \\"The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy, and Spaceflight\\" *http://members.aol.com/kummersdrf/kummer0.htm *http://www.astronautix.com/sites/kumsdorf.htm *The official Erich Warsitz Website, inclusive rare videos and audio commentaries *http://beutepanzer.ru/Beutepanzer/Museum/Articles/Artcile.html *Pictures from Kummersdorf-Gut, Verskraft, Eisenbahnpioniere Schumkasee, Kaserne Klausdorf- Rehagen, Sperenberg Category:Geography of Brandenburg Category:Research and development in Nazi Germany Category:World War II sites in Germany Category:Bezirk Potsdam ","title":"Kummersdorf"},{"id":"1426750","text":"Get Over It may refer to: == Albums == * Get Over It (album), a 2000 album by Mr. Big * Get Over It (The Nextmen album), a 2003 album by The Nextmen * Get Over It!

It is a colourless non- toxic gasname=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov_DifluoromethaneCH2F2. == Uses == Atmospheric concentration of difluoromethane at various latitudes since year 2009. Difluoromethane is a molecule used as refrigerant that has excellent heat transfer and pressure drop performance, both in condensation and vaporisation. It has a 100-year global warming potential (GWP) of 675 times that of carbon dioxide, and an atmospheric lifetime of nearly 5 years.May 2010 TEAP XXI/9 Task Force Report It is classified as A2L - slightly flammable by ASHRAE,2009 ASHRAE Handbook and has zero ozone depletion potential (ODP). Difluoromethane is thus a relatively low-risk choice among HFC refrigerants, most of which have higher GWP and longer persistence when leaks occur. Difluoromethane in a zeotropic (50/50 mass%) mixture with pentafluoroethane (R-125) is known as R-410A, a common replacement for various chlorofluorocarbons (aka Freon) in new refrigerant systems, especially for air-conditioning. The zeotropic mix of difluoromethane with pentafluoroethane (R-125) and tetrafluoroethane (R-134a) is known as R-407A through R-407F depending on the composition. Likewise, R-504 is the azeotropic (48.2/51.8 mass%) mixture with chlorotrifluoromethane (R13). Difluoromethane is currently used in residential and commercial air-conditioners in Japan, China, and India as a substitute for R-410A. In order to reduce the residual risk associated with its mild flammability, this molecule should be applied in heat transfer equipment with low refrigerant charge such as brazed plate heat exchangers (BPHE), or shell and tube heat exchangers and tube and plate heat exchangers with tube of small diameter. Many applications confirmed that difluoromethane exhibits heat transfer coefficients higher than those of R-410A under the same operating conditions but also higher frictional pressure drops. == References == == External links == * Flammability Measurements of Difluoromethane in Air at 100 ¬∞C * Difluoromethane at Gas Encyclopaedia * IR absorption spectra Category:Fluoroalkanes Category:Halomethanes Category:Refrigerants ","title":"Difluoromethane"},{"id":"1426767","text":"Franciszek Jamro≈º (born 19 May 1943, Stalowa Wola) is a Polish politician who was the mayor of Gda≈Ñsk, Poland from 1991 to 1994.

Legal conflicts over the will took years to resolve, but in 1982 the trust finally received Getty's full bequest. The trust began to add a number of new programs in 1982, and in February 1983, it petitioned the court to change its name to the J.

Upon the dissolution of the GII, its data bases were transferred to the Getty Research Institute. ==Governance== The trust was established by a Trust Indenture dated December 2, 1953 that created a California charitable trust was \\"the diffusion of artistic and general knowledge.\\" The trust is governed by a 13-member board of trustees. Trustees are elected to serve four-year terms, with a maximum limit of three terms. The board is self-perpetuating with the board electing or re- electing the trustees.Getty Trust Bylaws, Section 2.2. Retrieved May 1, 2011. The board holds an annual meeting in May or June of each year.Getty Trust Bylaws, Section 2.6. Retrieved May 1, 2011. Although the board conducts most of its work through committees, a number of important decisions are reserved for the entire board including approval of any art acquisition costing more than $1 million.Getty Trust Bylaws, Section 3.2. Retrieved May 1, 2011. On October 2, 2006, the California Attorney General issued a report following an investigation of the trust and its operations. At the close of the investigation an independent monitor was hired to assure proper governance and expenditures of the trust. On May 7, 2008, the Attorney General closed the monitoring process. The trust was hurt by the economic downturn following 2007 and reduced its annual budget by 14%. In 2007, the trust had $6.4 billion in endowment, but this amount dropped to $4.5 billion in 2009. In 2009, the trust had $300 million in expenses down from $349 million in 2008. For example, GRI co-produced the Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals with the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library, but transferred that activity to Columbia University on July 1, 2009. With the recovery of the post-recession economy, the trust rose to $6.9 billion by 2017. == J. Paul Getty Medal == The J. Paul Getty Medal was established in 2013 by the Trustees of the J. Paul Getty Trust to honor extraordinary contributions to the practice, understanding and support of the arts. The first recipients of the Getty Medal, which was presented in December 2013, were Harold M. Williams and Nancy Englander, who were honored for their leadership in creating the Getty as it exists today. In November 2014, the Getty Medal was presented to Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, a volunteer cultural leader known for his dedication to the preservation and public interpretation of Waddesdon Manor. In September 2015, the Getty Medal was awarded to architect Frank Gehry, who has built an architectural career over five decades and produced public and private buildings in America, Europe, and Asia. His work has earned Mr. Gehry several of the most significant awards in the architectural field, including the Pritzker Architecture Prize. The 2016 Getty Medal was awarded to musician Yo- Yo Ma and, posthumously, to artist Ellsworth Kelly at a celebratory dinner in October. In addition to his accomplished career as a master cellist, Ma founded the Silk Road Ensemble and the nonprofit Silkroad to promote the creation of new music, cross-cultural partnerships, education programs, and cross-disciplinary collaborations to create meaningful change at the intersection of the arts, education, and business. Accomplished painter and sculptor Ellsworth Kelly has supported the conservation of historical and contemporary art at museums and heritage sites in the U.S. and around the world, as well as the preservation of natural environment, through the Ellsworth Kelly Foundation. Artist Anselm Kiefer and writer Mario Vargas Llosa were presented with the 2017 J. Paul Getty Medal at a dinner in New York City on November 13, 2017.https://www.getty.edu/about/whatwedo/medal.html In September 2018, the Getty Medal was awarded to Thelma Golden, director and chief curator of The Studio Museum in Harlem, Agnes Gund, president emerita of the Museum of Modern Art, and Richard Sierra, minimalist sculptor. The 2019 J.

Gardner worked in counter-intelligence, decoding Soviet intelligence traffic regarding espionage in the United States, in what came to be known as the Venona project. ==Life== ===Early life and career=== Gardner was born in Okolona, Mississippi, and grew up in Austin, Texas. After graduating from the University of Texas at Austin, he earned a master's degree in German from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where he was a teaching assistant from 1938 to 1940. Gardner was a linguist and professor of German at the University of Akron when the United States Army's Signals Intelligence Service recruited him to work on breaking German codes. Soon after, he started working on the Japanese codes instead, mastering the Japanese language in only a few months. ===Venona project=== Gardner, at far left, working with cryptanalysts In 1946, Gardner began work on a highly secret project (later codenamed Venona) to break the Soviet cryptosystems. The Soviet encryption system involved the use of one-time pads, and thus was thought to be unbreakable. However, the Soviets made the mistake of reusing certain pages of their pads. Later that same year, Gardner made the first breakthrough on Venona by identifying the ciphers used for spelling English words. By May 1947 Gardner had read a decrypt that implied the Soviets ran an agent with access to sensitive information from the War Department General Staff, U.S. Army Air Corps Major William Ludwig Ullmann. It became apparent to Gardner that he was reading KGB messages showing massive Soviet espionage in the United States. It was not until 1949 that Meredith Gardner made his big breakthrough. He was able to decipher enough of a Soviet message to identify it as the text of a 1945 telegram from Winston Churchill to Harry S. Truman. Checking the message against a complete copy of the telegram provided by the British Embassy, the cryptanalysts confirmed beyond doubt that during the war the Soviets had a spy who had access to secret communication between the president of the United States and the prime minister of Britain. Peter Wright met Meredith Gardner in London after the arrests of the atom spies: \\"He was a quiet, scholarly man, entirely unaware of the awe in which he was held by other cryptanalysts. He used to tell me how he worked on the matches in his office, and of how a young pipe-smoking Englishman named Philby used to regularly visit him and peer over his shoulder and admire the progress he was making. Gardner was rather a sad figure by the late 1960s. He felt very keenly that the cryptanalytical break he had made possible was a thing of mathematical beauty, and he was depressed at the use to which it had been put.\\" Wright revealed that Gardner was upset that his research had resulted in McCarthyism and the executions of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Wright quotes Gardner as saying: \\"I never wanted it to get anyone into trouble.\\" Wright added that Gardner \\"was appalled at the fact that his discovery had led, almost inevitably, to the electric chair, and felt (as I did) that the Rosenbergs, while guilty, ought to have been given clemency. In Gardner's mind, VENONA was almost an art form, and he did not want it sullied by crude McCarthyism.\\" ===Retirement=== Gardner retired in 1972, yet his work remained mostly secret until 1996, when the NSA, the CIA, and the Center for Democracy honored Gardner and his colleagues in a formal ceremony that was the result of campaigning by U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Gardner died on August 9, 2002, in Chevy Chase, Maryland, at the age of 89. Shortly before his death, he appeared in the PBS documentary Secrets, Lies, and Atomic Spies. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1912 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Cold War espionage Category:Mathematicians from Mississippi Category:National Security Agency cryptographers Category:People from Austin, Texas Category:People from Okolona, Mississippi Category:Pre-computer cryptographers Category:Signals Intelligence Service cryptographers Category:University of Akron faculty Category:University of Texas at Austin alumni Category:University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison alumni Category:University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison faculty ","title":"Meredith Gardner"},{"id":"1426803","text":"The Theatre on the Balustrade (Divadlo Na z√°bradl√≠) is situated in Prague, Czech Republic. The theatre was founded in 1958. Its founders - Helena Philipov√°, Ivan Vyskoƒçil, Ji≈ô√≠ Such√Ω and Vladim√≠r Vodiƒçka named their professional theatre after a street leading from the square to the river. Its first production, a musical collage titled If a Thousand Clarinets (Czech: Kdyby tis√≠c klarinet≈Ø), was premiered on 9 December 1958. Three months later Ladislav Fialka and his mime group joined the company with their production Pantomime on the Balustrade, and brought back fame to the almost forgotten theatre genre. Drama and mime companies coexisted at the theatre till Fialka's death in 1991. In the early 1960s, with the arrival of director Jan Grossman, set designer Libor F√°ra and a stage hand and later dramaturg and playwright V√°clav Havel, the Theatre on the Balustrade became the centre of the Czech form of the absurd theatre (V. Havel: The Garden Party, Memorandum, Alfred Jarry: King Ubu, Franz Kafka: Process). Despite the fact that the theatre established itself abroad (or maybe because of it) as well as in Czechoslovakia, Jan Grossman and V√°clav Havel were forced to leave the theatre in 1968. In the 1970s and 1980s the theatre became a refuge for film directors of the 1960s \\"new wave\\", whose film work was thwarted by the normalisation process. Apart from productions directed by J. Jire≈°, J. Krejƒç√≠k, J. Menzel and J. Herz, it was mainly Evald Schorm who regularly co-operated with the theatre since 1976 (e.g. The King Stag, Hamlet, The Karamazov Brothers, Marathon) and managed to group around himself a number of brilliant actors (J. Barto≈°ka, K. He≈ôm√°nek, J. Preissov√°, P. Zedn√≠ƒçek, L. Mrkviƒçka). In 1989 Jan Grossman returned to the theatre as a director and later its managing director, and after his untimely death in 1993 new management of the theatre was named - managing director Doubravka Svobodov√° and artistic director Petr L√©bl. Petr L√©bl was one of the most talented young directors with distinctive imagination who provoked with his interpretations of classics (J. Genet: The Maids, L. Stroupe≈ænick√Ω: Our Our Swaggerers, N. V. Gogol: The Government Inspector, A. P. Chekhov: The Seagull, Ivanov, Uncle Vanya). After L√©bl's death in 1999 the theatre continued its seeking, novel course of the present Theatre on the Balustrade with its new artistic direction of Ivana Sl√°mov√°, Ji≈ô√≠ Ornest and Jan Anton√≠n Pit√≠nsk√Ω. From the start of the season 2002/2003 a young director and playwright Ji≈ô√≠ Pokorn√Ω became, together with Ivana Sl√°mov√°, the new artistic director of the theatre. With arrival of new artistic director David Czesany in 2010 the Divadlo Na z√°bradl√≠ (Theater on the Balustrade) started off with a program of theme-based seasons. The first was named ‚ÄúWho will be let through heaven‚Äôs gates?‚Äù, the current one (2011/2012) will be focused on public space and the city as a place for living and will be called ‚ÄúWhose city?‚Äù. Programming decisions as well as other projects of the theatre will be based on this topic: the upcoming season will bring exhibitions and meetings with witnesses to the changes that parts of the city have gone through. The topic of the city will also be tackled by students of art schools as a part of the Eliade Library project that introduces new creative projects, final works of art school graduates and works for children.

It was the first organized mass working-class party in European history. The organization existed by this name until 1875, when it combined with the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany (SDAP) to form the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany. This unified organization was renamed soon thereafter the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), which presently remains in existence and dates its origins to the founding of the ADAV. Its Austrian part would become the SP√ñ. The ADAV was the first German Labour Party, formed in Prussia prior to the establishment of the German Empire. It was active in the German Confederation, which included the Austrian Empire. == Organizational history == === Establishment === Ferdinand Lassalle, founder of the ADAV The ADAV was founded in Leipzig by Ferdinand Lassalle and twelve delegates from some of the most important cities in Germany, namely Barmen, Dresden, D√ºsseldorf, Elberfeld, Frankfurt am Main, Hamburg, Harburg, Cologne, Leipzig, Mainz and Solingen. The ADAV sought to advance the interests of the working class and to work for the establishment of socialism by the use of electoral politics.Tom Goyens (2007). Beer and Revolution: The German Anarchist Movement in New York City, 1880‚Äì1914. Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press. p. 65. Lassalle acted as president from 23 May 1863 until his death in a duel on 31 August 1864. The unofficial organ of the ADAV was the newspaper Der Sozial- Demokrat (The Social Democrat), launching publication in Berlin on 15 December 1864.Vladimir Sazonov (1987). Footnotes to Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 42: Marx and Engels, 1864-68. New York: International Publishers. p. 599. fn. 80. The publication initially won promises of editorial contributions from the radical exiles Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, but the pair soon disfavored the notion owing to the allegiance of the Sozial-Demokrat and the ADAV to the memory and ideas of their nemesis Lassalle.Karl Marx in London to Carl Siebel in Elberfeld. Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 42. p. 58. === Development === The ADAV had its first congress, called a General Assembly, in D√ºsseldorf on 27 December 1864.Sazonov. Footnotes to Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 42. p. 599, fn. 82. Marx and his associates had hoped that this gathering would cause the organization to join the newly established International Workingmen's Association (First International), which they helped manage, but the gathering did not discuss affiliation, further disaffecting Marx from the group. Wilhelm Liebknecht was a member until 1865, but as the ADAV tried to cooperate with Otto von Bismarck's government, for example on the question of women's suffrage, Liebknecht became disillusioned with the association. He had been writing for Der Sozial-Demokrat, but as a result of disagreement with the newspaper's Prussia-friendly rhetoric he quit the organization to establish the Saxon People's Party along with August Bebel. In 1869, Liebknecht became a co-founder of the SDAP in Eisenach as a branch of the International Workingmen's Association. Liebknecht was to meet again with his old ADAV colleagues as the lack of support for the ADAV caused them to join forces with Liebknecht's SDAP in 1875. === Merger and legacy === Together with the SDAP, the ADAV formed the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany at the Socialist Unity Conference in Gotha. The manifesto of the new organization was the Gotha Program, which urged \\"universal, equal, direct suffrage\\". In 1890, the party was renamed the Social Democratic Party of Germany and it still exists under this name. The SDP now dates its origins to the founding of the ADAV and celebrated its 150th anniversary in the spring of 2013.Peter Schwarz (23 May 2013). \\"The SPD Celebrates its 150th Anniversary\\".

The structure was the home of author Margaret Mitchell in the early 20th century. It is located in Midtown, at 979 Crescent Avenue. Constructed by Cornelius J. Sheehan as a single-family residence in a then-fashionable section of residential Peachtree Street, the building's original address was 806 Peachtree Street. The house was known as the Crescent Apartments when Mitchell and her husband lived in Apt. 1 on the ground floor from 1925 to 1932. While living there, Mitchell wrote the bulk of her Pulitzer Prize- winning 1936 novel, Gone with the Wind. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is also designated as a historic building by the City of Atlanta. This house serves as the heart of Atlanta History Center‚Äôs Midtown Campus and it houses permanent exhibitions that focus on various topics surrounding the building‚Äôs history and its famous occupant, Margaret Mitchell. Through guided tours of Margaret Mitchell‚Äôs apartment, guests can explore the complex issues raised by Gone With the Wind, and by Mitchell‚Äôs life. The Margaret Mitchell House examines the popularity along with criticism of the book and film. Atlanta History Center encourages open discussion about the content of the book and film, the evidence from historical reality, and Margaret Mitchell‚Äôs life. Along with interpretation about the house‚Äôs former resident, the Midtown Campus also serves as an accessible hub for community events, such as Author Talks, Atlanta United match viewing parties, Atlanta Pride events, and many others. ==House history== The house was built as a single-family residence in 1899. Commercial development quickly overtook the neighborhood, however, and in 1907 the original family moved to Druid Hills. The house changed hands several times until the winter of 1913‚Äì14 when the house was moved onto a new basement story constructed on the rear of the lot. Given a Crescent Avenue address, the building was remodeled in 1919 and converted into a ten-unit apartment building, known as the Crescent Apartments, and \\"three brick stores\\" were built where the house had originally sat. Located in what was then Atlanta's largest business district outside of downtown, close to trolley lines, and walking distance from her parents' house, the Crescent Apartments was home to Margaret Mitchell and John Marsh when they married in July 1925. Unfortunately, the building's owner became over-extended, and it was sold at auction in 1926. The next owner, too, was driven to bankruptcy when the stock market crashed in 1929. Maintenance declined, contributing to Mitchell's characterization of their apartment as \\"the Dump.\\" By the fall of 1931, there were only two occupied apartments in the building, one of which belonged to the Marshes, but they, too, moved to a larger apartment a few blocks away in the spring of 1932. Rear of the Margaret Mitchell House With a new owner, the Crescent Apartments were revived and continued to attract tenants until shortly after World War II. By then, the building was in poor condition, and in 1946 the porches were removed from the Crescent Avenue side of the building. (The original front porches were lost when the building was moved in 1913). By the 1950s, the building was mostly vacant and overdue for rehabilitation. There were a few commercial tenants, and the old apartments were popular with Georgia Tech students. In 1964, the opening nearby of Ansley Mall signaled the death knell for the old commercial district on Peachtree Street between 8th and 14th. But at the same time, the Crescent Apartments got a much-needed rehab and were reborn as the Windsor House Apartments. In 1977, the last tenants were evicted and the building boarded up by a new owner who intended a major redevelopment of the area. By the time he and his company went bankrupt in the late 1980s, their only accomplishment was construction of a new office building at 10th and West Peachtree and the razing of dozens of historic buildings in the area. Atlanta Historical Center marker The old Crescent Apartments continued to deteriorate, especially after a fire set in the southwest corner of the building did minor damage in the late 1980s. In 1989, Mayor Andrew Young helped secure Margaret Mitchell House‚Äôs future by designating it a city landmark on the rolls of what is now the city‚Äôs Office of Urban Design - Historic Preservation Division. When the decision was made to restore the property, the architectural history of the structure was taken into account, and the front of the house was restored as it was in 1899. The back of the building was restored as it was when Margaret Mitchell called it home. However, another fire, presumed to be arson, destroyed much of the building in September 1994. Afterwards, Daimler-Benz Corporation, the German auto manufacturer, gave $4.5 million to restore the property and purchase its surrounding city block. With a Mercedes-Benz plant near Birmingham, Alabama, Daimler-Benz anticipated using the facility for hospitality events during the 1996 Summer Olympics. In May 1996, only 40 days before the Centennial Games‚Äô Opening Ceremonies, the house again was victim of an arson attempt. This fire occurred at a point where the restoration was almost complete, and all but Margaret Mitchell‚Äôs apartment was damaged or destroyed. After the 1996 fire, $2 million collected from insurance allowed the restoration to continue. The House was dedicated on May 16, 1997. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. === See also === * National Register of Historic Places listings in Fulton County, Georgia ==References== ==External links== * Official site * National Register profile * Atlanta, Georgia, a National Park Service Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary * Margaret Mitchell House historical marker Category:Margaret Mitchell Category:Houses completed in 1899 Category:Historic house museums in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Houses in Atlanta Category:Museums in Atlanta Category:Cinema museums in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:National Register of Historic Places in Atlanta Category:City of Atlanta-designated historic sites ","title":"Margaret Mitchell House and Museum"},{"id":"1426815","text":"Asrar ul Haq Majaz commonly known as Majaz Lakhnawi (19 October 1911 ‚Äì 5 December 1955) was an Indian Urdu poet.

Retrieved on 2018-11-13. He was the maternal uncle of poet and screenplay writer Javed Akhtar. ==Early life and education== Majaz was born on 19 October 1911 at Rudauli in Barabanki district of what is now Uttar Pradesh. His family were a branch of a land-owning gentry family, but were not wealthy. He was one of numerous children, but only three of his siblings reached adulthood, and among them, his only surviving brother died at age 18 in a freak accident, when Majaz was only nine. After that, Majaz became the only son of his family, and he had two older sisters, namely Safia and Hamida. Safia was the wife of poet Jan Nisar Akhtar. Thus, Majaz was the maternal uncle of Javed Akhtar. Majaz suffered from a hearing impairment even as a child, and probably for this reason, he tended to be somewhat difficult, with erratic behavior; he was moody and also a loner. He had the habit of staying awake all night and doing most of his work then; as a result, his earned the nickname \\"Jaggan\\" (\\"awake\\" in Hindi). Majaz's father, Seraj-ul-Haq, was a university graduate at a time when this was rare; he joined government service, serving in the middle ranks of the registration department, and finally reached the rank of Assistant Registrar. He was posted mainly in Lucknow, but since his aged parents needed attention, he kept his wife and children in the ancestral house at Rudauli, which is not far from Lucknow, and he would visit them about twice a month. Thus, Majaz grew up mainly in Rudauli and received his basic education there. In the late 1920s, his father was transferred to Agra. Since his parents were no more, and since Agra was too far from Rudauli for frequent visits, Seraj- ul-haq decided to take his wife and children with him. Majaz completed school in Agra in 1929, and enrolled in St. John's Intermediate College. Almost immediately, his father was transferred to Aligarh, and the family moved again, leaving Majaz in a hostel. The young Majaz was given a cash allowance for the first time in his life, and freedom from his mother's eagle surveillance. He behaved like any teenager of his age, neglected his studies, spent his time and money the way he liked, and failed his exams. Yet, his time was spent not on games or in disreputable activities, but in attending mushairas (poetry symposia) and music concerts. It was at this time that he came in contact with both senior and upcoming poets of Agra, including Fani Badayuni, Al-e-Ahmed Suroor and Jazbi. With difficulty, Majaz finally cleared his intermediate exams in 1931, and rejoined his parent in Aligarh, where his father got him enrolled for BA at Aligarh Muslim University, his subjects being philosophy, economics and Urdu. He graduated in 1935, again taking a year more than he should have. He then enrolled for an MA in the same university, but was not serious about it, and never completed it. ==Career== Aahang self Autograph Copy by Majaz The years that Majaz spent in Aligarh Muslim University coincided with the presence there of many important poets and writers of Urdu.

The parish is located on the Weald, to the west of Tenterden. In addition to the main village, Iden Green, East End, Dingleden and Standen Street settlements are included in the parish.Benenden Parish Council The parish church is dedicated to St George, and is a 19th-century building on the site of a medieval building destroyed in a fire.St George's church Benenden School, a private girls boarding school is located to the north of the village. ==Origin of name== The place name of Benenden (pronounced Ben-en-den) derives from Old English meaning Bynna's wooded pasture. Bynning denn became Benindene (1086) Binnigdaenne, Bennedene (c1100) Bynindenne (1253) then the current spelling from 1610.The Place Names of Kent, Judith Glover The Origin of English Place Names, P.H.Reaney ==History== :A more detailed history can be found in the pdf file as part of a Conservation AppraisalConservation Appraisal on Beneden and Iden Green (PDF) carried out by Tunbridge Wells District in April 2005 The Wealden iron industry probably existed in the area from before the Roman period, but evidence of two Roman roads built to take the cast iron from the Weald have been discovered, as well as other finds from the period. The evidence of one road, that between Maidstone and Hastings at Iden Green, is in the form of a paved ford. The Domesday Book surveyors remarked that Benindene was one of only four places in the Weald to have a church; although like most of the other such, the buildings of the settlement were scattered.The Kent Village Book Alan Bignell, 1986, Countryside Books From the 14th century places such as Benenden became of industrial importance. The Wealden ironmasters continued what the Romans had done; and the other major industry, cloth-making, also helped to make the village prosperous. By the late 18th century, however, both industries had moved to the industrial north, and Benenden's prosperity was at an end. Benenden had four mills at various times. Wandle Mill, a watermill on the River Rother; East End Mill, a post mill at the site later occupied by the chest hospital, demolished c.1870; and a pair of mills to the east of the village, one of which, Beacon Mill is still standing. In 1860 Gathorne Hardy, later to become the 1st Earl of Cranbrook (1814‚Äì1906), a prominent politician, rebuilt the house in Hemsted Park, one of the Tudor buildings; in 1912 Lord Rothermere made further alterations. It now houses Benenden School In 1907 a consortium of trade unions and friendly societies established a chest hospital in Goddard's Green Road, BenendenHistory of Benenden Hospital for the treatment of tuberculosis. Today the hospital is an independent organisation, for most medical and surgical specialities and mainly treats members of The Benenden Healthcare Society as well as some NHS and private patients. Collingwood Ingram and James Collingwood Tinling are buried in the graveyard. Creag may well have been played in Benenden from medieval times, however cricket has been played on the traditional village Green since the 18th century, although the first known mention of an organised club was not until 1798. The club still plays cricket on the Green in front of the St. George's parish church and between the Bull Inn and King William IV public houses. The village sign on the Green commemorates the English professional cricketer John Wenman. In December 2018 the village hit the national news in the UK after a family of wild swans was shot and killed by an unknown attacker. Newspaper reports stated that two adults and five cygnets were shot dead in the village, then wrapped in plastic bags and dumped on a river bank.Henry Vaughan, 'Yobs slaughter family of swans in \\"senseless\\" air gun attack' in The Mirror (UK newspaper), 2 December 2018 ==Benenden School== A well known private school, Benenden School is located to the north of the main village.

He moved to New Orleans after getting in trouble for his politics in Belgium. In the U.S. he continued his journalistic, astronomical, and political pursuits. He was an abolitionist and joined with unionists before the war in Texas. He worked with Louis Charles Roudanez at a newspaper in New Orleans, before living in Jamaica for a while, receiving reinstatement from an observatory in Brussels and returning to Europe. He came back to Texas for an astronomical event. He published stirring accounts of his adventures and contacts during his travels as well as several works on astronomical subjects. ==Life== Houzeau was born in Havr√© (a small city near Mons), then in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, later in Belgium. From 1842, he worked as a voluntary assistant at the Brussels Observatory and began writing papers. He eventually became the observatory's director. He travelled a lot during his career, to Paris, the United Kingdom, United States, Mexico and Jamaica. The scientist moved to New Orleans after being removed from the Belgian Royal Observatory for \\"outspoken political views\\". In Texas by 1858, he first worked as a surveyor, then moved to Uvalde and organized early scientific expeditions. He believed in the abolition of slavery and so aided the escape of some notable unionists from San Antonio. He soon had to flee, disguised as a Mexican laborer, into Mexico. Later in New Orleans, when the city had been taken by Federal forces, he ran a Union newspaper, the bilingual New Orleans Tribune - La Tribune de la Nouvelle-Orl√©ans, then for eight years lived in Jamaica. Finally, having kept his European contacts, he was reinstated as director of the Royal Observatory in Brussels. In December 1882, however, Houzeau made a return trip to Texas.

With a length of almost , it is the longest highway in Australia, with the majority included as part of the Perth Darwin National Highway. The highway is constructed as a sealed, predominantly two- lane single carriageway, but with some single-lane bridges in the Kimberley. The Great Northern Highway travels through remote areas of the state, and is the only sealed road link between the Northern Territory and northern Western Australia. Economically, it provides vital access through the Wheatbelt and Mid West to the resource-rich regions of the Pilbara and Kimberley. In these areas, the key industries of mining, agriculture and pastoral stations, and tourism are all dependent on the highway. In Perth, the highway begins in Midland near Great Eastern Highway, and further north intersects the Reid and Roe highways, which together form Perth's ring road. There are also three rural highways that spur off Great Northern Highway. Brand Highway and North West Coastal Highway provide an alternative coastal route between Muchea and Port Hedland, while Victoria Highway carries the National Highway route and interstate traffic into the Northern Territory. Various road routes are allocated to sections of Great Northern Highway, including the Highway 1 routes National Route 1 and National Highway 1, as well as National Highway 95\\\\. The highway was created in 1944 from existing roads in the Wheatbelt and a series of tracks through remote pastoral areas. However, it was a hazardous route that could be dusty in the dry season, and boggy or washed away in the wet season. Some sections were effectively impassable sand, while others contained limestone outcrops. Economic growth and development in northern Western Australia prompted initial improvement efforts, and the federal government's Beef Roads Scheme in the 1960s resulted in a noticeably higher- quality road in the Kimberley. Construction of a sealed road from Perth to Wyndham, including numerous bridges to reduce the impact of seasonal flooding, took many years to complete. The last section opened on 16 December 1989, and received national media coverage. However, by then many older sections were either worn out or not up to modern standards. Various upgrades have been carried out in small sections, across the length of the highway, with further works planned. A major realignment of the highway in Perth is scheduled for construction between 2016 and 2019, as part of the NorthLink WA project that will also upgrade Tonkin Highway. ==Route description== Great Northern Highway is the main north-south route between Perth and the northern areas of Western Australia. Covering a distance of , it is the longest highway in Australia. From Midland in Perth's north-east, the highway heads generally north-east through the Wheatbelt and Mid West to Newman, north-west to the coastal Pilbara town of Port Hedland, along the coastline to Broome, east to Halls Creek, and finally north to Wyndham, on the state's northern coastline. out from Wyndham, the highway intersects the start of Victoria Highway, which carries interstate traffic to the Northern Territory via Kununurra. Various road routes are allocated to sections of Great Northern Highway, which is mostly a National Highway route, and also forms part of Australia's Highway 1\\\\. It is signed as National Route 1 from Midland to Middle Swan, National Highway 95 and National Route 1 concurrently from Middle Swan to Muchea, National Highway 95 from Muchea to Mundabullangana, and National Highway 1 from Mundabullangana to Victoria Highway. The vast majority of the highway is a two-lane single carriageway, although there are thirteen single-lane bridges and four single-lane floodways in the Kimberley. The speed limit is except in and around built up areas. Great Northern Highway travels to remote areas of Western Australia, including the Munjina Roadhouse near the Hamersley Ranges, and the communities of Eighty Mile Beach, Wallal, Sandfire and Mandora, which are located between Broome and Port Hedland. It is the only sealed road between the Northern Territory border and major population centres in the north of the state. Economically, Great Northern Highway is also a vital link in the resource rich regions of the Wheatbelt, Mid West, Pilbara, and Kimberley. The key industries of mining, agriculture, and pastoral stations are all dependent on the highway as a significant and in some cases only method of transport. Tourism accounts for a significant portion of the road's traffic, and is a growing part of or potential growth source for the regional economies. The highway provides access to a variety of tourist attractions, including New Norcia and various national parks, including Karijini. Parts of the highway itself are included in the tourist routes Swan Valley Tourist Drive (Tourist Drive 203) in Perth, Chittering Valley Tourist Way (Tourist Drive 359) in Bullsbrook, Midlands Tourist Way (Tourist Drive 360) from Upper Swan to Walebing, and Geikie‚ÄìWindjana Tourist Way (Tourist Drive 350) from Geikie Gorge National Park to Fitzroy Crossing. Main Roads Western Australia monitors traffic volume across the state's road network, including various locations along Great Northern Highway. From 2007/08 to 2008/09, the recorded traffic volumes ranged between 7,830 and 17,710 vehicles per weekday in Perth, 510 to 2,990 in the Wheatbelt, 470 to 590 in the Mid West, 390 to 10,840 in the Pilbara, and 170 to 4,090 in the Kimberley. The highest percentage of heavy traffic was 52.5%, north of Newman Drive in the Pilbara. Overall, Great Northern Highway performs favourably in terms of road safety, compared to other major highways in Western Australia. Whilst making up two thirds of the state's National Highway network, it was the location of only half of all recorded fatalities for 2005‚Äì2009. For that period, the sections of the highway from Wubin to the Sandfire Roadhouse, north-east of Port Hedland, were considered by the Australian Automobile Association to be among the lowest risk highway links in the state. However, the section from Perth to Wubin was rated as medium risk, and the northern sections of the highway were rated medium-high and high risk. In 2013, Great Northern Highway received a similar rating, still higher overall than the other highways. Out of five stars, 21% was rated as one- or two-star, and 79% was rated three- or four-star, with the southern and northern ends of the highway generally less safe than the portion from Wubin to the Sandfire Roadhouse. ===Perth=== Within Perth, Bullsbrook is the northernmost urban area along Great Northern Highway. Great Northern Highway begins at Morrison Road, Midland, in Perth's north-eastern suburbs, signed as National Route 1\\\\. Though it originally commenced at Great Eastern Highway, that section is no longer contiguous, and is now named Old Great Northern Highway. The highway heads north through Middle Swan, intersecting the start of Toodyay Road after , and then the meeting point of Reid and Roe Highways after another . Those highways come together from Perth's ring road, signed as State Route 3, and north of this intersection Great Northern Highway is concurrently allocated National Highway 95 and National Route 1\\\\. It continues north through the Swan Valley for , passing many wineries, restaurants, and other tourist attractions. The highway crosses the Swan River and intersects West Swan Road, before turning north-east to travel around the residential part of Upper Swan. Great Northern Highway continues north for beyond West Swan Road, past larger agricultural properties, to reach Bullsbrook, the last urban area within the Perth Metropolitan Region. After beyond Bullsbrook, the highway reaches the edge of the Perth metropolitan area at the City of Swan‚ÄìShire of Chittering boundary, where it passes into the Wheatbelt. ===Wheatbelt=== View south from Bindoon In the Wheatbelt, Great Northern Highway links small town sites with the surrounding rural farmland, occasionally passing by remnant patches of woodlands. From the north-eastern edge of Perth, the highway travels north for to Muchea. At Muchea the road curves to the west to approach a roundabout interchange with both Brand Highway and Tonkin Highway. Unlike other interchanges in the outskirts of Perth, Great Northern Highway is not free flowing with the interchange configured to have an overpass connecting the northern continuation of Great Northern Highway with Tonkin Highway to the south instead. Traffic wanting to continue on Great Northern Highway need to turn right at the roundabout to continue northwards while southbound traffic needs to exit the main carriageway and turn left at the roundabout. Brand Highway and National Route 1 continues to the west of the roundabout. There is also a Road train assembly area in the southeast quadrant of the interchange. Great Northern Highway and National Highway 95 then continues north-east for . It passes to the west of Lake Chittering, curves east to cross the Brockman River, and then back north to Bindoon. further north, Bindoon‚ÄìMoora Road branches off to the north-west, while the highway skirts east briefly then continues north, reaching New Norcia after . The starting point of The Midlands Road is located at Walebing, further north; from there, Great Northern Highway heads north-east for to Bindi Bindi, north for to Miling, then east for to the northern end of Northam‚ÄìPithara Road, and shortly thereafter Pithara. From here, another takes the road to Dalwallinu, and Wubin is further north. ===Mid West=== North-east of Wubin, the highway travels into the Outback. As Great Northern Highway heads north-east from Wubin out of the Wheatbelt, the vegetation changes to arid shrubland. In the Mid West region, the long stretches between settlements show few signs of human activity, other than the highway itself. The first such settlement is Paynes Find, out from Wubin. At this point the highway heads north again, reaching Mount Magnet after , and then Cue after another . The road travels north-east for to Meekatharra, and then has a long stretch up to the northern edge of the Mid West at the Fortescue River, near Newman Airport. Halfway along this stretch the highway passes a roadhouse at Kumarina. ===Pilbara=== Great Northern Highway travels past the north-east of Newman. after crossing the Fortescue River, Great Northern Highway intersects Marble Bar Road, the highway's original alignment. It proceeds north to Marble Bar, mostly as an unsealed road, whilst the highway deviates north-west, reaching Newman after . The flat landscape gives way to gentle ranges, which the highway meanders around as it heads west-north-west for . It then curves around to the north, proceeding over a distance of to Karijini Road, the entrance road to the Karijini National Park. The highway continues north for another , travelling through the north-eastern corner of the national park to Nanutarra Munjina Road. Great Northern Highway proceeds on its journey north, crossing the Yule River and its tributaries. The highway then runs parallel to the Turner River over a distance until it reaches North West Coastal Highway. This junction is the northern terminus of the National Highway 95, and Great Northern Highway continues north-east as National Highway 1 ‚Äì part of Australia's Highway 1, which is signed as National Route 1 along North West Coastal Highway. The turnoff for Port Hedland is north-east of the intersection, and from there the highway heads east for to the northern end of Marble Bar Road, and reaching Pardoo after another . It parallels the coastline thereafter, passing into the Kimberley region shortly after the Pardoo Roadhouse. ===Kimberley=== Phantom River between Halls Creek and Warmun From Pardoo, Great Northern Highway travels north-east, paralleling the coastline for , and passing Eighty Mile Beach near the Sandfire Roadhouse. The vegetation becomes denser woodlands once more as the highway heads into the Kimberley's tropical monsoon climate. At Roebuck the highway turns east, heading inland, while Broome Roads spurs off to the west, connecting to Broome. After , the highway crosses the Fitzroy River on Willare Bridge and reaches the turnoff for Derby, Derby Highway, in Willare. Great Northern Highway continues east for to Fitzroy Crossing, where it crosses the Fitzroy River a second time. It continues east, curving around the southern side of the Margaret River, and reaching Tanami Road after . The town of Halls Creek and the Duncan Road turnoff are north-east of there. From here the highway heads north for , past Warmun to Victoria Highway. The national highway route turns off at Victoria Highway, travelling past Kununurra to cross into the Northern Territory. Great Northern Highway, however, continues north-west without a route number, passing the eastern end of Gibb River Road after , and reaching Wyndham following another . The highway continues on for to reach the original townsite and the harbour, where it takes on the local names Odonnell Street, McPhee Street, and Harbour Road. ==History== ===Highway origins=== The name Great Northern Highway was first proposed in October 1940 by the state's Nomenclature Advisory Committee, to describe the main route from Midland to Geraldton, Western Australia. This was following the naming of the Great Eastern and Great Southern highways. The Midland Junction Municipal Council approved the name, however at the Geraldton Municipal Council meeting, one councillor suggested that Great Midland Highway would be a better name. The reasoning was that Geraldton was in the centre of the state's coastline, not in the north. It was explained that the highway would continue north past Geraldton, and the council voted to approve the name. By July 1941, the Nomenclature Advisory Committee's proposal had expanded to three highway names for the roads in the state's northern areas: Great Northern Highway for \\"the road from Midland Junction Town Hall to Wyndham, via Walebing, Pithara, Wubin, Payne's Find, Mt. Magnet, Cue, Nannine, Meekatharra, Roy Hill, Nullagine, Marble Bar, Mulyee, De Grey, Pardoo, Wallal, Anna Plains, Le Grange, Broome, Derby, Noonkanbah, Fitzroy Crossing, Christmas Creek, Louisa Downs, Hall's Creek and Turkey Creek\\", North West Coastal Highway for \\"the road from Geraldton to De Grey, via Northampton, Galena, Carnarvon, Boolaganoo, Winning Pool, Giralia, Yanrey, Onslow, Peedamullah, Mardie, Karratha, Roebourne, Whim Creek, Mundabullangana and Port Hedland\\", and Geraldton Highway for \\"the road from Walebing to Geraldton via Mingenew\\". The proposal was well received by the local municipal councils and road boards. A car struggles to cross the flooded Fortescue River (February 1942). The name Great Northern Highway was gazetted on 10 March 1944, under section 10 of the Land Act, 1933‚Äì1939. However, the highway was mostly a series of tracks through remote pastoral areas, with the sealed road ending just past the Wheatbelt town of Miling in 1950. Driving was difficult and hazardous all year round. The road was very dusty in the dry season, and some sections of the road were effectively impassable sand, while other sections contained limestone outcrops that damaged tyres. During the wet season, when rivers flooded, sections of road were essentially bogs, or worse still, were completely washed away. ===Sealing the highway=== ====Initial efforts==== Economic growth and development in Western Australia's northern regions in the 1940s prompted the state to quadruple road funding between 1946 and 1952. Five \\"gangs\\" of workers were allocated to a length of Great Northern Highway between Meekatharra and Wyndham. However, given the vast distance the highway travelled, and destructive cyclones in the Pilbara and Gascoyne that could destroy multiple weeks worth of work, the overall improvement was relatively insignificant. Over time, though, the road was improved. New alignments were constructed, such as between Derby and Fitzroy Crossing in the late 1940s, which had originally followed the curve of the Fitzroy River, along its floodplain, and could only be used in the dry season. The new alignment was a more direct section, with the first sealed, a total of of gravel road, and the remainder simply formed earth. Despite this low construction standard, the road remained passable except for short periods during heavy rain. ====Beef Roads Scheme==== In 1961, the federal government passed the Western Australian Grants (Beef Cattle Roads) Act 1961, known as the Beef Roads Scheme, that encouraged road building in the Kimberley. This had followed on from an earlier federal grant scheme in 1949 for the construction of a road from Nicholson to Wyndham. The road allowed trucks to efficiently transport cattle to port, rather than the slow cattle drives that could lose stock and take weeks to complete. The 1961 Beef Roads Scheme initially included upgrading the Wyndham to Halls Creek section of Great Northern Highway as one of three projects in the region. One year later the scheme was expanded to include the Broome to Halls Creek section of the highway, and several bridge construction projects. However, the resources allocated to Great Northern Highway were needed to maintain the highway as an unsealed road in a usable condition, rather than to completely seal the roadway. In 1963, work was completed on stabilising a sandy section to prevent vehicles from becoming bogged, a section was realigned to avoid the Fortescue River floodplain, and between Marble Bar and Port Hedland was also realigned to minimise the effects of wet weather. ====Perth to Newman==== The projects funded by the Beef Roads Scheme resulted in a noticeably higher quality road in the Kimberley, but work still progressed on other sections of the highway. In 1970, a single-lane sealed section was completed between Perth and Meekatharra. The project was one of the first in the state to be constructed by contractors rather than by Main Roads directly. It cost $9 million, two-thirds of which was spent after 1959. The next section to be upgraded and sealed was from Meekatharra to Newman, a project that would take four and a half years to construct. Due to the remoteness of the location, airstrips were built alongside the highway, so that workers could be flown in from Geraldton. The highway was realigned in several spots, to avoid difficult areas, improve river crossings, or give drivers a more scenic view of the surrounding area. New bridges were constructed along the route, including a reinforced concrete bridge at the Fortescue River, and a four-span bridge over the Gascoyne River's Middle Branch. By December 1978, the sealed road reached Newman, with the project completed three months ahead of schedule, and at a cost of $20 million, $1 million under budget. With a seal and shoulders, the road could easily accommodate two lanes of traffic. Previously sealed sections, totalling of the highway, were less than half that width. Premier Charles Court opened the new and improved highway on 12 December 1978. ====Port Hedland to Wyndham==== The two-lane sealed road between Halls Creek and Wyndham was also completed in 1978. It involved the construction of 21 bridges, and extensive earthworks designed to blend the road into the terrain. The section was opened on 23 July 1978 by the Minister for Transport, at a cost of over $20 million. Meanwhile, work on sealing and upgrading the section from Port Hedland and Broome began in 1976. With up to five contractors and four Main Roads teams working throughout the project, it was completed at an extraordinarily rapid pace. It opened in April 1981 at a cost of $56 million. With the opening of this section, tourist traffic escalated. Cape Keraudren, Eighty Mile Beach, and Broome became increasingly favoured destinations, especially for residents of the Pilbara. Great Northern Highway south-east of Fitzroy Crossing Work accelerated in the 1980s as part of the Australian Bicentenary Road Development program. From October 1982, the program provided $2.5 billion to upgrade the country's roads in the lead up to Australia's bicentenary in 1988. By this time, the only sections of Great Northern Highway yet to be sealed were a stretch from Fitzroy Crossing to Halls Creek, and another between Newman and Port Hedland. Construction of the Fitzroy Crossing to Halls Creek section began in October 1981. The route had been surveyed in 1979; with the collaboration of the Western Australian Museum, Main Roads ensured it would not impact important Aboriginal heritage sites. After five years of work, including the construction of nine bridges, the widened and sealed section was completed on 7 September 1986. At the time, this was the final section of the nationwide Highway 1 to be sealed, and there was national interest. The media captured the completion on camera, while the federal Minister for Transport, Peter Morris, together with the Western Australian Minister for the North West, Ernie Bridge, rode on the bitumen truck for the final spray. With this section completed, the Newman to Port Hedland section of Great Northern Highway was the only significant section of unsealed highway in Western Australia. ====Newman to Port Hedland==== A realignment of the highway between Newman and Port Hedland had been proposed since 1976, which would see the road deviate to the west at Newman, and travel via Wittenoom instead of Marble Bar. In the early 1980s, eleven route corridors were investigated by Main Roads. The potential impacts on the natural environment, regional economy, tourism, and resident population were considered, with particular concern for the crossing of the Hamersley Range. Great Northern Highway curves down through Munjina Gorge. As the highway would pass through the Hamersley National Park, the Environmental Protection Authority decided in 1983 that an Environment Review and Management Program report was required for the Newman to White Springs section. Consultants prepared the report for Main Roads, which found that the key risks were erosion, visual impact, and possible damage to flora. A detailed survey was carried out, which included the use of laser and infra-red measuring devices from within a helicopter, and numerous field trips to determine the final alignment and bridge sites. A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was then produced, and the project was approved in mid-1984. In early 1986, the contract for this segment through the Munjina and Mungina East gorges was awarded. Construction of this segment involved tight control over earthworks and machinery movements, to protect the National Park ecology. The finished road was a scenic route curving down through the Munjina Gorge and out onto the Fortescue River flood plain, with cuttings and embankments blending it in with the natural environment. It was opened on 12 June 1987 by the federal Minister for Transport, Peter Morris, having cost $28.4 million. Other portions of the Newman ‚Äì Port Hedland link were completed over the next two years, with the last part officially opened on 16 December 1989 by Bob Brown and Bob Pearce, the federal and state transport ministers. This last section of Great Northern Highway also completed the sealing of the National Highway, and the opening ceremony, held on location south of Port Hedland, received national media coverage. ===Fitzroy River crossing, Willare=== In the late 1960s, Main Roads investigated alternative crossing points over the Fitzroy River, to replace the existing low-level bridge at Yeeda. Flooding in January 1966 had demonstrated that Willare was the best site. The new route would be longer, and required two bridges, but would result in a better quality road. When tenders were called, the river flooded again, washing away of the old bridge. Rather than reconstruct the low-level crossing, the construction timeframe was shortened from 18 months to 38 weeks. The Willare Bridge and Minnie River Bridge opened on 12 June 1968, having cost almost $700,000. While situated higher than the worst known flood level, the single-lane bridges were designed to accommodate more extensive flood levels, with the water flowing over them if necessary. By the early 1980s, it was clear that the Fitzroy River crossing was still inadequate. Seasonal flooding had closed the road several times, and damaged the embankments leading up the bridges. The crossing had been closed for twenty four days in 1982; while in 1983, the most severe flooding since 1914 extensively damaged of the highway, closing it for twenty-five days. To alleviate the problem, two new bridges were built in 1985, and the road was widened and raised above the flood plain. The earthworks for the project included constructing guide banks to direct excess water to flow over floodways, which were protected with rocks. This was designed to minimise the time the road would be closed in such a scenario. The $11 million upgraded crossing was opened on 19 December 1985 by the federal Minister for Transport, Peter Morris. Then, one month later, Cyclone Hector produced 70% more water than the crossing had been designed for. Water overflowed the road all along the flood plain, not just at designated floodways, ravaging the shoulders and then destroying sections of road. of the highway was washed away, leaving the bridges isolated and disconnected. The road was closed from 27 January to 14 February 1986, with $200,000 spent just to make the crossing passable. It was then redesigned and rebuilt at a cost of $1.9 million to make it more flood resistant. ===Further improvements=== Standard two-lane road with unsealed shoulders near Paynes Find in 2010 Despite the provision of a completely sealed road, there was still much work to be done on the highway, with many older sections either worn out or not up to modern standards. Narrow sections were widened to a full , and repairs made to the road, shoulders, fencing, and line markings as required, with work carried out in sections and progressing along the length of the highway. Four overtaking lanes were constructed between Mount Magnet and Cue in 1991; and between 1991 and 1993, there were eight contracts awarded to widen, reconstruct, and seal a combined total of more than of the highway. A range of projects were carried out across the length of the highway between 1996 and 2006. By 1998, a section between the Sandfire Roadhouse and Victoria Highway had been improved at a cost of $1.1 million, and another north of Meekatharra was improved for $12 million in 1999. Two bridges were constructed in the vicinity of Halls Creek in 2000, and another four in 2004/05, replacing floodways so that the highway would remain open during floods. Similarly, north of Halls Creek, the Jarlalu Bridge over the Ord River was constructed to replace a single-lane floodway, and was opened in January 2003. That same year, the bridges over the Fortescue and Gascoyne Rivers were strengthened to increase the highway's load capacity. Modifications were made to the steep ascent of the Darling Scarp at Bindoon Hill between February 2002 and April 2003, and Great Northern Highway was realigned to bypass the Dalwallinu town centre. Work on Great Northern Highway has been continuous. From 2004 to 2010, the Muchea to Wubin section was upgraded, with parts reconstructed and realigned, and traffic lights installed at the intersection with Brand Highway. In the Kimberley, five sections between Halls Creek and Victoria Highway were improved between 2008 and 2009 with regards to pavement strength, alignment, safety, and flood resistance. From 2005 to 2010, the Perth section, through the Swan Valley, was upgraded, with the road widened, turning and overtaking lanes constructed, and street lighting improved. Construction of a realignment around Port Hedland's Wedgefield industrial area, including a new parclo interchange at Wilson Street, began towards the end of 2012. It was opened to traffic on 17 June 2014, and on 23 July 2014, Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss, Federal Member for Durack Melissa Price, and Pilbara MLA Brendon Grylls officially opened the project. It was finalised in August. In October 2013, construction began on a project to straighten and widen Great Northern Highway's curves around Bindi Bindi. The project was completed and opened to traffic on 27 February 2015, and allowed the speed limit to be raised from . A section between Batty Bog Road (north of New Norcia) and Walebing was reconstructed between September 2014 and 2015. ===Perth Darwin National Highway=== Perth Darwin National Highway Swan Valley bypass (dashed orange line) In the early 1990s, a corridor study conducted by Main Roads into the long-term needs of the Perth to Darwin National Highway concluded the existing Great Northern Highway, with bypasses around rural towns and the Swan Valley, was the most suitable route for the National Highway. Planning the alignment for the southernmost section, from Reid Highway in Perth to Bindoon, was undertaken from 2003 to 2013. It resulted in the planned alignment commencing from Tonkin Highway, bypassing the Swan Valley and Bullsbrook before reconnecting with Great Northern Highway near Brand Highway. Great Northern Highway is then followed until the Brockman River, where the planned route deviates to the east to bypass Bindoon, reconnecting with the existing Highway near Bindoon‚ÄìMoora Road. The first stage of construction was undertaken as part of the NorthLink WA project. Tonkin Highway's original northern section was made grade separated, and a dual carriageway extended from the original northern end of Tonkin Highway (near Reid Highway) past Ellenbrook and through the Swan Valley to an interchange with Great Northern Highway and a new part of Brand Highway, with the extension continuing on as Great Northern Highway. The previously planned route of the bypass, prior to 2012, followed Lord Street, east of Whiteman Park. The project is funded by both the state and federal governments. Construction began in June 2017, and was completed on 23 April 2020. == Damage == As observed in the 2018 Broome flood, the highway, and its river crossings are always at risk in extreme weather situations. ==Future== Further upgrading is planned for Great Northern Highway towards its southern end, as well as elsewhere along the highway. Planning has been completed for widening an section of Fitzroy Crossing, including replacing two single-lane bridges. , the project is awaiting federal approval, and construction is unfunded. ===Muchea to Wubin Stage 2 Upgrade=== In late 2015 Main Roads completed a planning review for an upgrade of the highway between Muchea and Wubin. Known as Muchea to Wubin Stage 2 Upgrade, the project continues work undertaken on this section from 2000 to improve the road to National Highway standards. Several bypasses, realignments, and other improvements have been planned at or near Muchea, Bindoon, New Norcia, Walebing, Miling, Pithara, Dalwallinu, Nugadong, and Wubin. Sections near Bindi Bindi and Batty Bog, completed in 2015, were included in the review. The highest priority works are scheduled to be completed between 2016 and 2019. These include the New Norcia Bypass, Milling Straight section, Muchea North section (designed to link to the NorthLink WA project), and Milling Bypass. , designs are being finalised for the Walebing Curve, Dalwallinu Bypass, Nugadong, and Wubin Bypass section, while funding has not been confirmed for the Bindoon upgrades. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * Highways in Australia * List of highways in Western Australia * List of major roads in rural Western Australia * List of roadhouses in Western Australia ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== Category:Highways and freeways in Perth, Western Australia Category:Highways in rural Western Australia Category:Pilbara Category:Kimberley (Western Australia) Category:Mid West (Western Australia) Category:Highway 1 (Australia) ","title":"Great Northern Highway"},{"id":"1426846","text":"The Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park consists of several buildings in Atlanta, Georgia, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s boyhood home and the original Ebenezer Baptist Church, the church where King was baptized and both his father Martin Luther King Sr. and he were pastors. ==History== These places, critical to the interpretation of the life of Martin Luther King Jr. and his legacy as a leader of the American Civil Rights Movement, were originally included in the National Historic Site or National Historic Landmark listings first established on October 10, 1980. The site was expanded and designated as a national historical park through a bipartisan bill long championed by John Lewis and signed on January 8, 2018, by President Donald Trump. In total, the buildings included in the site make up 35 acres (0.14 km¬≤). The visitor center contains a museum that chronicles the American Civil Rights Movement and the path of Martin Luther King Jr. The King Center for Nonviolent Social Change includes the burial place of King, and his wife, activist Coretta Scott King. An 1894 firehouse (Fire Station No. 6) served the Sweet Auburn community until 1991, and now contains a gift shop and an exhibit on desegregation in the Atlanta Fire Department. The \\"I Have a Dream\\" International World Peace Rose Garden, and a memorial tribute to Mohandas K. Gandhi are part of the site, as is the \\"International Civil Rights Walk of Fame\\" which commemorates some of the courageous pioneers who worked for social justice. Annual events celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day in January typically draw large crowds. Speakers have included Presidents of the United States, national and local politicians, and civil rights leaders. Remembrances are also held during Black History Month (February), and on the anniversary of King's April 4, 1968, assassination in Memphis, Tennessee. ==Preservation== Grave site The Martin Luther King Jr. Historic District, an area bounded roughly by Irwin, Randolph, Edgewood, Jackson, and Auburn avenues, was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 2, 1974. and The district included Ebenezer Baptist Church, King's grave site and memorial, Dr. King's birthplace, shotgun row houses, Victorian houses, the Alexander Hamilton House, the Atlanta Baptist Preparatory Institute site, Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church, Fire Station No. 6, and the Triangle Building at the intersection of Old Wheat Street and Auburn Avenue. Much of the area was designated as a national historic landmark district on May 5, 1977. The Trust for Public Land purchased 5 single-family homes along Auburn Avenue in the late 1970s, the same block Martin Luther King Jr. grew up on. The Trust for Public Land purchased more than a dozen properties over the next 20 years to create a parking lot as well as a pedestrian greenway to link the King district to the Jimmy Carter Presidential Center. In 2008, The Trust for Public Land acquired one of the remaining historic properties in the neighborhood, on the corner of Auburn Avenue. By U.S. Congressional legislation, the site with associated buildings and gardens was authorized as a national historic site on October 10, 1980; it is administered by the National Park Service (NPS). and A area including 35 contributing properties was covered, including 22 previously included in the NRHP historic district. The area covered in the NRHP designation was enlarged on June 12, 2001. In 2018 it was redesignated as a national historical park, adding Prince Hall Masonic Temple to the protected area. ==Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birth Home== King's boyhood home The King Birth Home is located at 501 Auburn Avenue in the Sweet Auburn historic district. Built in 1895, it sits about a block east of Ebenezer Baptist Church.Virtual Tour of Birth Home King's maternal grandparents, Reverend Adam Daniel (A.D.) Williams, who was pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church, and his wife, Jennie Williams, bought the house for $3,500 in 1909. In 1926, when King's father married Alberta Williams, the couple moved into the house, where King Jr. was born in 1929. The King family lived in the house until 1941. It was then converted into a two-family dwelling. The Rev. A. D. Williams King, Dr. King's brother, lived on the second floor in the 1950s and early 1960s. The first level includes the front porch, parlor, study, dining room, kitchen, laundry, bedroom and a bathroom. The second level includes four bedrooms and a bathroom. The visitor center offers free tours of the house led by National Park Service rangers, but with limited availability. ==The King Center== In 1968, after King's death, Coretta Scott King founded the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change. Gary L. Anderson, Kathryn G. Herr, Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice, SAGE Publications, USA, 2007, p. 804 Since 1981 the Center has been housed in a building that is part of the King complex located on Auburn Avenue adjacent to Ebenezer Baptist Church.The King Center in 2016, close to the Ebenezer Baptist Church, at the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site. In 1977, a memorial tomb was dedicated to King. His remains were moved to the tomb, on a plaza between the center and the church. King's gravesite and a reflecting pool are located next to Freedom Hall. After her death, Mrs. King was interred with her husband on February 7, 2006. An eternal flame is located nearby. Freedom Hall at 449 Auburn Avenue features exhibits about Dr. and Mrs. King, Mahatma Gandhi and American activist Rosa Parks. It hosts special events and programs associated with civil rights and social justice. It contains a Grand Foyer, large theater/conference auditorium, bookstore and resource center, and various works of art from across the globe. The Grand Foyer features art from Africa and Georgia. The paneling lining the staircase is from the sapeli tree, which grows in Nigeria. In 1990, Behold, a statue honoring Martin Luther King Jr., was dedicated near Ebenezer Baptist Church. As of 2006, the King Center is a privately owned inholding within the authorized boundaries of the park. The King family has debated among themselves as to whether they should sell it to the National Park Service to ensure preservation. ==Visitor center== Courage to Lead exhibit at the visitor center The visitor center at 449 Auburn Avenue was built in 1996 and features the multimedia exhibit Courage To Lead, which follows the parallel paths of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement. Visitors can also walk down a stylized \\"Freedom Road\\". The Children of Courage exhibit, geared towards children, tells the story of the children of the Civil Rights Movement with a challenge to our youth today. Video programs are presented on a continuing basis and there is a staffed information desk. ==Gandhi Promenade== The statue of Mohandas Gandhi was donated by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, India, in collaboration with The National Federation of Indian American Associations and The Embassy of India, USA. The inscribed bronze plaque reads: ==International Civil Rights Walk of Fame== The \\"International Civil Rights Walk of Fame\\" was created in 2004 and honors some of the participants in the Civil Rights Movement. The walk along the Promenade, includes footsteps, marked in granite and bronze. According to the National Park Service, the Walk of Fame was created to \\"pay homage to the \\"brave warriors\\" of justice who sacrificed and struggled to make equality a reality for all.\\" The new addition to the area is expected to enhance the historic value of the area, enrich cultural heritage, and augment tourist attractions. The \\"Walk of Fame\\" is the brainchild of Xernona Clayton, founder and executive producer of the renowned Trumpet Awards and a civil rights activist in her own right. Ms. Clayton said, \\"This is a lasting memorial to those whose contributions were testaments to the fact that human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. This historic site will serve as a symbol of pride and a beacon of hope for all future generations. We are looking forward to building a monument to the civil struggle that depicts every step taken toward the goal of justice and the tireless exertions and passionate concern of these dedicated individuals.\\" ==Prince Hall== Located at 332 Auburn Avenue, the Prince Hall Masonic Temple is where the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) established its initial headquarters in 1957. This historic and distinguished civil rights organization was co-founded by Dr. King, who also served as its first president. Owned by the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Georgia, the building was included within the authorized boundary of the park in 2018. ==Photo gallery== Image:MLK sign.JPGThe Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park honors the life of Dr. King Image:MLK Site 1.jpg Shotgun houses on Auburn Ave. directly across from Dr. King's boyhood home Image:MLK Site 2.jpg Shotgun houses in historic district Image:MLK Site 3.jpg Late 19th/Early 20th century homes on Auburn Ave. in the Martin Luther King Jr. Historic District ==See also== *List of National Historic Landmarks in Georgia (U.S. state) *National Register of Historic Places listings in Fulton County, Georgia *List of areas in the United States National Park System#National historical parks *Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History ==Notes== ==References== * Coleman, Wim.

The Arches Court, presided over by the Dean of Arches, is an ecclesiastical court of the Church of England covering the Province of Canterbury. Its equivalent in the Province of York is the Chancery Court. ==Provincial Court== The Court of Arches is the provincial Court of Appeal for Canterbury. It has both appellate and original jurisdiction. It is presided over by the Dean of the Arches, who is styled The Right Honourable and Right Worshipful the Official Principal and Dean of the Arches. The dean must be a barrister of ten years' High Court standing or the holder or former holder of high judicial office. The appointment is made by the two archbishops jointly. At various times the court has sat in the church of St Mary-le-Bow (Sancta Maria de arcubus, formerly the archbishop's principal peculier in London), whose arches give the court its name. The court used to sit in a large room over the N. aisle of the 11th-century crypt adjoining Bow Lane. The room was later rebuilt on an even larger scale, and eventually came to be used as the vestry.Plans of the church and crypt at After the Great Fire it was held in Doctors' Commons and also at 1 The Sanctuary, Westminster and St Paul's Cathedral. Its permanent home remains St Mary le Bow, where regular sittings include those to confirm the election of each new diocesan bishop in the province. The Provincial Registry is at 16 Beaumont Street, Oxford OX1 2LZ. The proper jurisdiction of the court is over only the 13 peculiar parishes belonging to the archbishop in London. But, as the office of Dean of the Arches is united with that of Principal Official, the dean receives and determines appeals from the sentences of all lesser ecclesiastical courts within the province. Many original suits are also heard, where lesser courts waive jurisdiction by letters of request. Appeal lies with the Privy Council, except on matters of doctrine, ritual or ceremony, which go to the Court for Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved. There may also be a Deputy Dean. The court normally consists of the dean, two clerks appointed by the prolocutor of the lower house of the appropriate convocation and two lay people appointed by the Chairman of the House of Laity in consultation with the Lord Chancellor. Such appointees will have had judicial experience and be diocesan chancellors. Since 1991 there have been two diocesan chancellors appointed by the dean. All these are assistant provincial court judges. Original jurisdiction was formerly exercised by a separate provincial court, known as the Court of Audience. ==History== The jurisdictions called \\"peculiars\\" at one time numbered nearly three hundred in England. They were originally introduced by the Pope for the purpose of curtailing a bishop's authority within his diocese. The dean of the Arches originally had jurisdiction over the thirteen London parishes mentioned above, but as the official principal was often absent as ambassador on the continent, the dean became his substitute, and gradually the two offices were blended together. The judge of the Arches court was until 1874 appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury for the life of the holder. But by the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874 the two archbishops were empowered to appoint a practising barrister or judge as described above. The official principal of the Arches court is the only ecclesiastical judge who is empowered to pass a sentence of deprivation against a clerk in holy orders. The appeals from the decisions of the Arches court were formerly made to the king in chancery, but they are now by statute addressed to the king in council, and they are heard before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. By an act of Henry VIII (Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Act 1532) the Arches court is empowered to hear, in the first instance, such suits as are sent up to it by letters of request from the consistory court of the bishops of the province of Canterbury, and it is further empowered to accept letters of request from the bishops of the province of Canterbury after they have issued commissions of inquiry under that statute, and the commissioners have made their report. The Arches court was also the court of appeal from the consistory courts (of the bishops of the province) in all testamentary and matrimonial causes. The matrimonial jurisdiction was transferred to the secular courts by the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 and testamentary jurisdiction by later statute. ==Leadership== The Provincial Registrar of Canterbury is appointed by the archbishop, after consultation with the Standing Committee of the General Synod. There may be a deputy provincial registrar. The provincial registrar acts as legal advisor to the archbishop, the registrar of the provincial court and the joint registrar of the General Synod. == References == * ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Archives of the Court of Arches at Lambeth Palace Library Category:Canon law of the Church of England Category:Ecclesiastical courts ","title":"Arches Court"},{"id":"1426851","text":"Croydon is a district in the London Borough of Croydon, England.

He was also a civil servant, serving as a Commissioner of the Royal Navy. He was a friend and colleague of Samuel Pepys, and features prominently in the Great Diary. ==Biography== Brouncker was born in Castlelyons, County Cork, the elder son of William Brouncker (1585-1649), 1st Viscount Brouncker and Winifred, daughter of Sir William Leigh of Newnham. His family came originally from Melksham in Wiltshire. His grandfather Sir Henry Brouncker (died 1607) had been Lord President of Munster 1603-1607, and settled his family in Ireland. His father was created a Viscount in the Peerage of Ireland in 1645 for his services to the Crown. Although the first Viscount had fought for the Crown in the Anglo- Scots war of 1639, malicious gossip said that he paid the then enormous sum of ¬£1200 for the title and was almost ruined as a result. He died only a few months afterwards. William obtained a DM at the University of Oxford in 1647. Until 1660 he played no part in public life: being a staunch Royalist, he felt it best to live quietly and devote himself to his mathematical studies. He was one of the founders and the first President of the Royal Society. In 1662, he became Chancellor to Queen Catherine, then head of the Saint Catherine's Hospital. He was appointed one of the Commissioners of the Royal Navy in 1664, and his career thereafter can be traced in the Diary of Samuel Pepys; despite their frequent disagreements, Samuel Pepys on the whole respected Brouncker more than most of his other colleagues, writing in 1668 that \\"in truth he is the best of them\\". Although his attendance at the Royal Society had become infrequent, and he had quarreled with some of his fellow members, he was nonetheless greatly displeased to be deprived of the Presidency in 1677. He was commissioner for executing the office of Lord High Admiral of England from 1679. ===Abigail Williams=== Brouncker never married, but lived for many years with the actress Abigail Williams (much to Pepys' disgust) and left most of his property to her. She was the daughter of Sir Henry Clere (died 1622), first and last of the Clere Baronets, and the estranged wife of John Williams, otherwise Cromwell, second son of Sir Oliver Cromwell, and first cousin to the renowned Oliver Cromwell. She and John had a son and a daughter. The fire of 1673 which destroyed the Royal Navy Office started in her private closet: this is unlikely to have improved her relations with Samuel Pepys, whose private apartments were also destroyed in the blaze. On Brouncker's death in 1684, his title passed to his brother Henry, one of the most detested men of the era. William left him almost nothing in his will \\"for reasons I think not fit to mention\\". == Mathematical works == His mathematical work concerned in particular the calculations of the lengths of the parabola and cycloid, and the quadrature of the hyperbola,W. Brouncker (1667) The Squaring of the Hyperbola, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, abridged edition 1809, v. i, pp 233‚Äì6, link form Biodiversity Heritage Library which requires approximation of the natural logarithm function by infinite series.Julian Coolidge Mathematics of Great Amateurs, chapter 11, pp. 136‚Äì46 He was the first European to solve what is now known as Pell's equation. He was the first in England to take interest in generalized continued fractions and, following the work of John Wallis, he provided development in the generalized continued fraction of pi. === Brouncker's formula === This formula provides a development of œÄ/4 in a generalized continued fraction: : \\\\frac \\\\pi 4 = \\\\cfrac{1}{1+\\\\cfrac{1^2}{2+\\\\cfrac{3^2}{2+\\\\cfrac{5^2}{2+\\\\cfrac{7^2}{2+\\\\cfrac{9^2}{2+\\\\ddots}}}}}} The convergents are related to the Leibniz formula for pi: for instance : \\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\frac{1^2}{2}} = \\\\frac{2}{3} = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{3} and : \\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\frac{1^2}{2+\\\\frac{3^2}{2}}} = \\\\frac{13}{15} = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{5}. Because of its slow convergence Brouncker's formula is not useful for practical computations of œÄ. Brouncker's formula can also be expressed asJohn Wallis, Arithmetica Infinitorum, ... (Oxford, England: Leon Lichfield, 1656), page 182. Brouncker expressed, as a continued fraction, the ratio of the area of a circle to the area of the circumscribed square (i.e., 4/œÄ). The continued fraction appears at the top of page 182 (roughly) as: ‚òê = 1 1/2 9/2 25/2 49/2 81/2 &c; , where the square denotes the ratio that is sought.

Popularly known as NSS, the scheme was launched in Gandhiji's Centenary year in 1969. Aimed at developing student's personality through community service, NSS is a voluntary association of young people in Colleges, Universities and at +2 level working for a campus-community (esp. Villages) linkage. ==History== After independence the University Grants Commission, headed by S. Radhakrishnan, recommended the introduction of voluntary national service in academic institutions. This idea was again considered by the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) at its meeting in January, 1950; after examining the idea and the experiences of other countries in this field, the board recommended that students and teachers should devote time to voluntary manual work. In the draft first Five-Year Plan adopted by the government in 1952, the need for social and labour service by Indian students for one year was stressed. In 1958 Jawaharlal Nehru, in a letter to the chief ministers, considered the idea of social service as a prerequisite for graduation. He directed the Ministry of Education to formulate a suitable scheme for the introduction of national service into academic institutions. ===Launch of NSS=== In May 1969, a conference of student representatives (of universities and institutions of higher education) convened by the Ministry of Education and the University Grants Commission also unanimously agreed that a national-service scheme could be an instrument for national integration. The details were soon worked out and orientation camp was organized at Rajghat. This camp was concluded on 7 June 1969.KKGupta from DU was declared first volunteer. The Planning Commission sanctioned an outlay of ‚Çπ5 crores for the NSS during the Fourth Five-Year Plan, stipulating that the NSS be a pilot project in selected institutions and universities. On 24 September 1969, the then Union Education Minister V.K.R.V. Rao launched the NSS at 37 universities all states. The scheme has been extended to all states and universities in the country, and also +2 level institutes in many states. ==Symbol of N.S.S(National Service Scheme)== The symbol for the NSS has been based on the giant Rath Wheel of the world-famous Konark Sun Temple (The Black Pagoda) situated in Odisha, India. The wheel portrays the cycle of creation, preservation and release. It signifies the movement in life across time and space, the symbol thus stands for continuity as well as change and implies the continuous striving of NSS for social change. The eight bars in the wheel represents 24 hours of a day. The red colour indicates that the volunteer is full of young blood that is lively, active, energetic and full of high spirit. The navy blue colour indicates the cosmos of which the NSS is tiny part, ready to contribute its share for the welfare of the mankind. It stands for continuity as well as change and implies the continuous striving of NSS. ==Aim== The programme aims to instilling the idea of social welfare in students, and to provide service to society without bias. NSS volunteers work to ensure that everyone who is needy gets help to enhance their standard of living and lead a life of dignity. In doing so, volunteers learn from people in villages how to lead a good life despite a scarcity of resources. it also provides help in natural and man-made disasters by providing food, clothing and first aid to the disaster's victims. ==Organization== At national level, of India is the nodal authority, which works with state-level NSS cells. State-level NSS cells are responsibility of the respective state governments. Within states, each university has University level NSS cell under which institutions (schools and colleges) based NSS units operate. Most government and government-aided institutions have volunteer NSS units. Institutions are encouraged to have NSS volunteers. A unit typically comprises 20‚Äì40 students. They are managed internally by a responsible party from the school or college, who reports to the regional NSS coordinator. Most institutions do not have a separate uniform for NSS volunteers as one of the great and dedicated toward welfare of India Captain. ==Types of Activities== There are two types of activities: Regular Activities(120 hours) and Annual Special Camp(120 hours). All the NSS Volunteers who have served NSS for at least 2 years and have performed 240 hours of work under NSS are entitled to a certificate from the university under the signature of the Vice-Chancellor and the Programme Coordinator. The Annual camps are known as Special Camps. Camps are held annually, funded by the government of India, and are usually located in a rural village or a city suburb. Volunteers may be involved in such activities as: #Cleaning #Afforestation #Stage shows or a procession creating awareness of such issues as social problems, education and cleanliness #Awareness Rallies #Inviting doctors for health camps There are no predefined or preassigned tasks; it is left up to the volunteers to provide service in any way that is feasible. Camps typically last between a week and 10 days, although camps for shorter periods are also conducted by NSS. ==Themes of the programme== In the past the themes of the Special Camping Programmes have been 'Youth Against Famine', 'Youth Against Dirt and Disease', 'Youth for Rural Reconstruction', 'Youth for Eco-Development', 'Youth for Mass Literacy', 'Youth for National Integration & Social Harmony', 'Youth for Sustainable Development with special focus on Watershed Management and Wasteland Development'http://nss.nic.in/speccamp.asp \`Healthy Youth For Healthy India\` ==Other initiatives== In some institutions and colleges volunteers are involved in regular blood donation and traffic control (regulating queues in temples and preventing stampedes at functions).

It is located in the City of Playford. At the 2016 census, Elizabeth had a population of 1,024. Established in 1955, it was the seat of the former local government body, the City of Elizabeth, which included Elizabeth as well as the immediately adjacent suburbs on all sides except the west. Although the City of Elizabeth no longer exists, having been amalgamated into the much larger City of Playford in 1997, the term 'Elizabeth', in the context of Adelaide, typically refers to the historic municipality and the distinct community therein. ==History== Before the 1950s, most of the area surrounding today's suburb of Elizabeth was farming land. After the end of the Second World War with its shortage of materials, the state government decided that South Australia needed to grow and become industrialised. A satellite city was planned for northern metropolitan fringe of Adelaide between the existing townships of Salisbury and Smithfield. The South Australian Housing Trust initiated a housing development program in the area, with a purchase of at the site of the present suburb. The township (now suburb) of Elizabeth was established on 16 November 1955, being named after Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia. In 1964, a new local government body, the municipality of Elizabeth, later called City of Elizabeth, was created by severance from the District Council of Salisbury. This allowed the local government to focused explicitly on the newly-developed land and distinct local growing community centred at Elizabeth. ==Geography== Elizabeth is the seat of the Playford local government area and thus acts as a central business district for the surrounding suburbs. It lies mostly between the Gawler railway line and the hills face. DSTO Edinburgh is located to the west of Elizabeth. ==Demographics== In the 2016 Census, there were 1,024 people in Elizabeth. 65.2% of people were born in Australia and 76.3% of people spoke only English at home.

The majority of residents (66.2%) were Australian born, with 13.2% born in England. The age distribution of Elizabeth residents was similar to that of the greater Australian population. 67.5% of residents were aged 25 or over in 2006, compared to the Australian average of 66.5%; and 32.5% were younger than 25 years, compared to the Australian average of 33.5%. ==Media== The local newspaper was the now-closed News Review Messenger. Other regional and national newspapers such as The Advertiser and The Australian are also available.

The center houses three not-for-profit arts divisions on one campus. Opened in 1968, the Woodruff Arts Center is home to the Alliance Theatre, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, and the High Museum of Art. ==History== In 1962, Atlanta suffered an unprecedented loss when an airplane, the Chateau de Sully, carrying the leaders of Atlanta‚Äôs arts and civic community, crashed at Orly Airport in Paris. As the city grieved, it came together and used the devastating loss as a catalyst for the arts and built a fitting memorial to these victims. This led to the creation of the Atlanta Arts Alliance. The Memorial Arts Center, as the Woodruff was originally known, opened October 5, 1968. The building was designed by Atlanta architect, Joe Amisano.Gerald W. Sams, AIA guide to the architecture of Atlanta (University of Georgia Press, 1993), , pp. 48, 61, 127, 166. Excerpts available at Google Books. It was renamed the Woodruff Arts Center in 1982 to honor its greatest benefactor, Robert W. Woodruff. The art center also included the Atlanta College of Art, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the High Museum of Art. All three entities were combined into one corporation. The Alliance Theatre was added in 1970 as the fourth division of the Woodruff and 35 years later in 2005, a fifth division was added when Young Audiences joined the center. This addition ensures that the Woodruff‚Äôs PreK-12 programs now reach more than one million children annually, the largest base of any arts center in the country. The Woodruff campus expanded in 1983 with the addition of the Richard Meier-designed High Museum of Art building. This building made Meier the youngest Pritzker Prize-winning architect at that time. On November 12‚Äì13, 2005, the Woodruff introduced its largest expansion since opening in 1968. The new addition features two new exhibit buildings and a new administrative and curatorial building for the High Museum of Art; a residence hall and sculpture studio; a full-service restaurant -- Table 1280 at the Woodruff -- as well as a public piazza and a new parking structure. This new \\"village for the arts\\" was designed by another Pritzker Prize winner, Italian architect, Renzo Piano. ==Layout== The Woodruff campus sits on with a planned expansion to .

He spent most of his working life in Prague and Breslau (now Wroclaw) where he taught philosophy, theology and mathematics. He published a number of treatises on these three subjects and also on physics and music theory.Leon Voet, The Golden Compasses. The History of the House of Plantin- Moretus at DBNL Short biography of Theodorus Moretus ==Life== Illustration of an experiment showing the melting of metals with a glass, from Tractatus physico-mathematicus de aestu mari Theodorus Moretus was born in Antwerp, the son of Pieter and Henrica Plantin. Both his parents were from prominent printing families: his mother was a daughter of Christophe Plantin, the founder of the famous Plantin Press in Antwerp while his father was the brother of Jan Moretus who was initially an assistant of Plantin, married another Plantin daughter and, after taking over the Plantin Press from his father-in-law, steered the business to further success well into the 17th century. Theodorus Moretus' father was a diamond trader and cutter.H. Bosmans (S. J.), Th√©odore Moretus de la Compagnie de J√©sus, math√©maticien (1602‚Äì1667)] in: Le Compas d'Or, nouv. s√©rie, 6e ann√©e (1928), pp. 57‚Äì163 Moretus studied mathematics at the Jesuit school in Antwerp founded by Fran√ßois d'Aguilon. He was a student at this school for seven years. He joined the Jesuit order in Mechelen as a novice on 15 November 1618. He then studied at the University of Leuven.Jan. B. Hurych, Theodorus Moretus or the Messenger to Rome He took physics in 1622‚Äì1623 and studied theology from 1623 to 1627. In 1627‚Äì28 Moretus is mentioned as a teacher of syntax in Bruges. His title was Magister, which indicates he had not been formally ordained yet. His aptitude for science (particularly mathematics) was appreciated early on by Father Gregorius van St-Vincent, who had arranged for Moretus to be able to continue his studies in Louvain without first having to spend a few years in colleges. Gregorius van Vincent also arranged for Moretus to send dissertations on mathematical subjects to Christoph Grienberger, the chair of mathematics at the Collegio Romano in Rome who reviewed them. Moretus was possibly ordained as a priest in 1628‚Äì29. In 1629‚Äì30 Moretus was teaching in M√ºnster. The next year he moved to Prague to join Gregorius van Vincent who had been sent there to teach mathematics. Moretus was to assist the ailing Gregorius in his teaching duties. The following year, the invasion of the Swedes and the sacking of Prague during the Thirty Years' War forced both to leave Prague. While van Vincent first went to Vienna to recover, Moretus was sent to Olomouc (now in the Czech Republic), where he taught philosophy and other subjects until 1634. By that time Moretus had acquired the title of Master in Liberal Arts and Philosophy, but it is not clear when or where he obtained the title. He returned to Prague at the end of 1634. Moretus was the author of the first mathematical dissertation ever defended in the College of St. Clement (the 'Clementinum') in Prague. The dissertation was entitled Propositiones mathematicae de celeri et tardo, naturae et armorum and was defended by Moretus in 1633 or 1635. The present whereabouts of the manuscript of the dissertation is not known.Georg Schuppener, Karel Maƒç√°k, Prager Jesuiten- Mathematik von 1600 bis 1740, Leipziger Universit√§tsverlag, 2002, p. 42 Georg Schuppener, Jesuitische Mathematik in Prag im 16. und 17. Jahrhundert: (1556‚Äì1654), Leipziger Universit√§tsverlag, 1999, p. 111 From 1642 to 1645, Theodorus left his teaching post as he was sent as a preacher and missionary to the home that the Jesuits owned in Brzezenica, a small town in Galicia. In 1646 he was sent back to Prague as a professor, initially, of Holy Scripture and no longer of mathematics. He also was appointed to the office of councilor of the provincial council of Bohemia. Frontispiece of Principatus filii Hominis Jesu Moretus left Prague in 1653, and on 19 August of the same year, he took over the rectorate of the college of Klatovy. It was a difficult task as the little college had fallen into ruin and the new rector had to rebuild it with funds he had to find himself. He managed the college for three years. He spent the year 1657 at Neisse (now Nysa, in Poland), occupied in various apostolic ministries. From there he went to G≈Çog√≥w in 1658. The same year he embarked on a long journey through Bohemia, Moravia and Austria. In 1660 Moretus was for the first time attached to the College of Breslau, where he joined the apostolic ministry for the teaching of mathematics. He remained in this college for two years. He spent the year 1662 at K≈Çodzko but soon returned to Breslau, probably as early as 1663. It was during his stay at K≈Çodzko that he published his Principatus incomparabilis primi filii hominis messiae et primae parentis Matris Virginis : in conceptione illius immaculata exhibitus in Cologne. The Principatus is a work of both theology and piety and was intended to defend the thesis of the Immaculate Conception. Moretus submitted in 1664 a paper entitled Propositiones mathematicas ex harmonica de Soni Magnitude, which was later published. This treatise provided a mathematical analysis of the harmony of sounds. The work shows Moretus to be a follower of Pythagoras who was much attached to the old music.Wolfgang C. Printz, Satirische Schriften und Historische Beschreibung der edelen Sing- und Kling-Kunst, Walter de Gruyter, 1 January 1979, p. 409 It is from Breslau that Moretus sent the Tractatus physico-mathematicus de aestu mari (Physio- mathematical Treatise of the Tides), one of his best-known works, to Antwerp for publication. In this work he explains the tides as a result of the magnetism of the moon. Moretus died in Breslau (Wroclaw). The lunar crater Moretus was named after him.Details of the lunar crater named after Moretus ==Work== The scientific work undertaken by Moretus was very successful: he made various discoveries in physics and astronomy, hydraulics and music theory but mainly mathematics. His research in optics brought him even fame among such scientists as was Robert Hooke, Athanasius Kircher, Cornelis Drebbel and Jan Marek Marci. Moretus' scientific diaries containing technical notes and drafts as well as his correspondence with eminent European scholars of that time such as Athanasius Kircher, Balthasar Conrad, Giovanni Battista Riccioli are preserved in the National Library of the Czech Republic. His extensive correspondence with his family members Balthasar Moretus I and Balthasar Moretus II who had taken over management of the Plantin Press is partially preserved in the Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp. ==Selected works== ===Relating to mathematics=== *Mathematici Tractatus, Prague, 1641 *Propositiones mathematicae ex Optica de Imagine Visionis, Bratislava, 1661 *Propositiones mathematicas ex harmonica de Soni Magnitude, 1664 ===Relating to geometrics=== *De luna pascali et solis motu, Wroclaw, 1666 ===Relating to physics=== *De ponderum gravitate, Prague, 1663 *Tractatus physico- mathematicus de aestu mari, Antwerp, Jac.

Engineer believed that women should be treated as equal to men, and said that people who support an unjust order, or remain silent in view of gross injustices were not religious people. Women's inequality topped his priority list of injustices. However, critics said that his interpretations of the Qur'an were not strong enough to get people to change their beliefs surrounding women's place in Islam.

Located on Peachtree Street in Midtown, the city's arts district, the High is a division of the Woodruff Arts Center. In 2010 it had 509,000 visitors, 95th among world art museums. ==History== Retracings, a 1999 digital transparent work by Deanna Sirlin Part of the new addition to the High designed by Renzo Piano John Singer Sargent, Ralph Curtis on the Beach in Scheveningen, 1880 An Auguste Rodin sculpture The Shade, 1880-81, donated to the High by the French government in memory of victims of a plane crash during a museum-sponsored trip in Paris, France The museum was founded in 1905 as the Atlanta Art Association. In 1926, the High family, for whom the museum is named, donated their family home on Peachtree Street to house the collection following a series of exhibitions involving the Grand Central Art Galleries organized by Atlanta collector J. J. Haverty. Many pieces from the Haverty collection are now on permanent display in the High. A separate building for the museum was built adjacent to the family home in 1955. On June 3, 1962, 106 Atlanta arts patrons died in an airplane crash at Orly Airport in Paris, France, while on a museum-sponsored trip. Including crew and other passengers, 130 people were killed in what was, at the time, the worst single plane aviation disaster in history. Members of Atlanta's prominent families were lost including members of the Berry family who founded Berry College. During their visit to Paris, the Atlanta arts patrons had seen Whistler's Mother at the Louvre. In the fall of 1962, the Louvre, as a gesture of good will to the people of Atlanta, sent Whistler's Mother to Atlanta to be exhibited at the Atlanta Art Association museum on Peachtree Street. To honor those killed in the 1962 crash, the Atlanta Memorial Arts Center was built for the High. The French government donated a Rodin sculpture The Shade to the High in memory of the victims of the crash. In 1983, a building designed by Richard Meier opened to house the High Museum of Art. Meier won the 1984 Pritzker Prize after completing the building. The Meier building was funded by a $7.9 million challenge grant from former Coca-Cola president Robert W. Woodruff matched by $20 million raised by the museum. Meier's highly sculptural building has been criticized as having more beauty than brains. For example, constructed with white concrete, the lobby, a giant atrium in the middle of the building's cutaway cube, has almost no exhibition space, and columns throughout the interior restrict the way curators can display large works of modern art. Also with the atrium being just one of four quadrants, it's viewed as a luxuriously structured, but vacant pathway leading to the other exhibits, which is quite a shame when considering how radiant and light-filled the room is. At , the Meier building has room to display only about three percent of the museum's permanent collection. Although the building officially contains 135,000 square feet, only about is gallery space. The Meier building, now the Stent Family Wing, was termed Director Gudmund Vigtel's \\"crowning achievement\\" by his successor Michael Shapiro. During Vigtel's tenure 1963-1991, the size of the museum's permanent collection tripled, endowment and trust funds of more than $15 million were established, the operating budget increased from $60,000 to $9 million and the staff expanded from four to 150. In 2005, Renzo Piano designed three new buildings which more than doubled the museum's size to , at a cost of $124 million. The Piano buildings were designed as part of an overall upgrade of the entire Woodruff Arts Center complex. All three new buildings erected as part of the expansion of the High are clad in panels of aluminum to align with Meier's original choice of a white enamel fa√ßade. Piano's design of the new Wieland Pavilion and Anne Cox Chambers Wing features a special roof system of 1,000 light scoops that capture northern light and filter it into the skyway galleries. ==Collection== The interior of the High The High Museum of Art's permanent collection includes more than 17,000 artworks across seven collecting areas: African art, American art, decorative arts and design, European art, folk and self-taught art, modern and contemporary art, and photography. More than one-third of the High's collection was acquired after the museum announced its plans for expansion in 1999. Highlights of the collection include works by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Claude Monet, Martin Johnson Heade, Dorothea Lange, Clarence John Laughlin, and Chuck Close. African Art To reflect the continent‚Äôs deep, rich history while foregrounding recent innovations, the High‚Äôs African art collection includes a diversity of art forms from ancient through contemporary times. To represent the depth and breadth of the African diaspora, the High continues to strengthen its holdings of works by artists of African ancestry, including African American artists, to highlight cultural bonds throughout the Black Atlantic world and beyond. The heart and soul of the African art collection consists of extraordinary examples of masks and figurative sculptures, enriched by exceptionally fine textiles, beadwork, metalwork, and ceramics. Antiquities include an animated terracotta sculpture of a female torso wrapped in snakes (ca. 1200‚Äì1500). From the region of ancient Djenne, one of Africa‚Äôs oldest cities, this work represents Sogolon, mother of Sundiata, founder of the Mali Empire. Along with this work, a Qu‚Äôran (ca. 1600) from Timbuktu, Djenne‚Äôs sister city, highlights art of the Mali Empire, one of the largest and most important kingdoms the world has ever known. American Art The Museum‚Äôs American art collection includes more than 1,200 paintings, sculptures, drawings, and prints made by American artists between 1780 and 1980. With particular strengths in historic American sculpture and painting, the collection demonstrates the evolution of a distinctly American point of view in artistic representation. From early American portraiture to the splendor of the Gilded Age, the High‚Äôs nineteenth- century collection includes works by John Singleton Copley, Benjamin West, Eastman Johnson, Sanford Robinson Gifford, Frederick Kensett, John Henry Twachtman, Harriet Hosmer, Edmonia Lewis, Henry Ossawa Tanner, Mary Cassatt, and John Singer Sargent. The High also holds works by America‚Äôs most progressive artists of the modern age, from the Stieglitz Circle and abstract painters, to artists concerned with social justice and reform, to those rooted in the American art scene. Decorative Arts and Design The decorative arts and design collection explores the merging of function and aesthetics through form, material, process, place, and intent. It features the renowned Virginia Carroll Crawford Collection‚Äîthe most comprehensive survey of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century American decorative arts in the southeastern United States‚Äîwith important works by Alexander Roux, Herter Brothers, Tiffany & Co., and Frank Lloyd Wright. Other notable gifts include the Frances and Emory Cocke Collection of English Ceramics from 1640 to 1840. The collection‚Äôs international contemporary design holdings recently have expanded with the addition of significant works by Joris Laarman Lab, Jaime Hayon, Ron Arad, and nendo. With more than 2,300 objects dating from 1640 to the present, the collection explores the intersections between art, craft, and design; handcraft and technology; and innovation and making. European Art Autumn on the Seine, Argenteuil by Claude Monet, 1873 This collection represents seven centuries of artistic achievement throughout Europe. The High‚Äôs holdings of more than 1,000 paintings, sculptures, and works on paper span the 1300s through the 1900s and trace the development of religion, scientific discovery, and social change through the lens of the continent‚Äôs visual culture. In 1958, the Samuel H. Kress Foundation donated what became the core of the High‚Äôs European art collection. The Kress Collection includes Giovanni Bellini‚Äôs Madonna and Child, Vittore Carpaccio‚Äôs Prudence and Temperance, and other artworks from Renaissance and Baroque Europe. Since then, the High‚Äôs European collection has grown to represent most major art movements and styles, exemplified by paintings and sculptures of such masters as Nicolas Tournier, Guercino (Jesus and the Samaritan Woman at the Well), Jan Breughel the Elder, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Charles-Joseph Natoire, Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson (The Burial of Atala), Camille Corot, Jean-Joseph Carri√®s (Sleeping Faun), and Auguste Rodin (Eternal Spring). Today, the European collection is especially rich in French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, many of which came as a gift in 2019 from Atlanta collectors Doris and Shouky Shaheen. The holdings include Claude Monet‚Äôs 1873 Autumn of the Seine; Argenteuil, a rare seascape by Fr√©d√©ric Bazille, and Henri Matisse‚Äôs Woman Seated at the Piano, as well as paintings by Eug√®ne Boudin, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Henri Fantin-Latour, √âmile Bernard, √âdouard Vuillard, and others. The High‚Äôs significant European print holdings, displayed on a rotating basis, include work ranging from Albrecht D√ºrer‚Äôs sixteenth-century engravings to a complete edition of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec‚Äôs Elles portfolio of lithographs. Folk and Self-Taught Art The High Museum began collecting the work of living self-taught artists in 1975 and was the first general interest museum to establish a dedicated department for folk and self- taught art in 1994. This collection is especially rich in artworks by Southern and African American artists and features the largest groups of work by Bill Traylor, Howard Finster, Nellie Mae Rowe, and Thornton Dial held by any museum. Although the majority of these artists could be identified as American or contemporary, the High refers to them as ‚Äúfolk,‚Äù which underscores their status as artists of the people, or ‚Äúself-taught,‚Äù to emphasize that they were not formally trained. Modern and Contemporary Art Modern and contemporary art at the High traces the development of innovative visual languages since 1945 that have influenced how people perceive, understand, and interpret the world, its histories, and human experience. Modern and contemporary art at the High Museum includes outstanding examples of work by seminal artists, those just entering the canon, and emerging artists. The collection prominently features multiple works by artists such as Radcliffe Bailey, Alex Katz, and Ellsworth Kelly as well as a growing collection of significant individual works by artists including Micha√´l Borremans, Alfredo Jaar, Anish Kapoor, KAWS, Julie Mehretu, Judy Pfaff, Sarah Sze, and Kara Walker, with a special focus on work by African American artists. Photography The High began collecting photographs in the early 1970s, making it among the earliest museums to commit to the medium. Today, the photography department is one of the nation‚Äôs leading programs and, with some 7,500 prints, comprises the Museum‚Äôs largest collection. These holdings encompass work from around the world made by diverse practitioners, from artists, to entrepreneurs, to journalists, to scientists. Spanning the very beginnings of the medium in the 1840s to the present, the High‚Äôs collection has particular strengths in American modernist and documentary traditions from the mid-twentieth century as well as current contemporary trends. The photography collection maintains a strong base of pictures related to the American South and situates this work within a global context that is both regionally relevant and internationally significant. The High owns one of the largest collections of photographs of the civil rights movement and some of the country‚Äôs strongest monographic collections of photographs by Eugene Atget, Dawoud Bey, Isla Bing, Wynn Bullock, Lucinda Bunnen, Harry Callahan, William Christenberry, Walker Evans, Leonard Freed, Evelyn Hofer, Clarence John Laughlin, Abelardo Morell, and Peter Sekaer. The collection also gives special attention to pictures made in and of the South, serving as the largest and most significant repository representing the region's important contributions to the history of photography. Since 1996, the High's distinctive \\"Picturing the South\\" initiative has commissioned established and emerging photographers to produce work inspired by the area's geographical and cultural landscape. Past participants include Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, Emmet Gowin, Alex Webb, Alec Soth, Richard Misrach, Kael Alford and Debbie Fleming Caffery, whose commissions have all been added to the High's permanent collection. ==Exhibitions== Special exhibitions at the High feature strong global partnerships with other museums such as the Louvre and with the Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore and the Opificio delle pietre dure in Florence. In 2008, the museum inked an US$18 million deal for Louvre Atlanta, a three-year revolving loan of art from the Mus√©e du Louvre in Paris, resulting in the museum's highest attendance ever. Its most popular individual show was 2009's Louvre Atlanta: the Louvre and the Masterpiece. The museum is also a Smithsonian Institution Affiliate.

Ned Rifkin served as the museum's director between 1991 and 2000. During the tenure of director Michael E. Shapiro between 2000 and 2014, the museum nearly doubled the number of works in its permanent collection, acquiring important paintings by 19th and 20th century and contemporary artists. The High raised nearly $230 million during that time, increasing its endowment by nearly 30 percent and building an acquisition fund of nearly $20 million. In July 2015, the High Museum of Art announced that it had selected Randall Suffolk to be its new director. Suffolk began his tenure in November 2015. ==References== == External links == * * Atlanta Art Association Film from 1962 Category:Museums in Atlanta Category:Midtown Atlanta Category:Art museums in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Decorative arts museums in the United States Category:Folk art museums in the United States Category:Folk art museums in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Museums of American art Category:Institutions accredited by the American Alliance of Museums Category:Smithsonian Institution affiliates Category:Art museums established in 1905 Category:1905 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1983 Category:Richard Meier buildings Category:Renzo Piano buildings Category:African art museums in the United States ","title":"High Museum of Art"},{"id":"1426906","text":"Atlanta History Center is a history museum and research center located in the Buckhead district of Atlanta, Georgia. The Museum was founded in 1926 and currently consists of nine permanent, and several temporary, exhibitions. Atlanta History Center‚Äôs campus is 33-acres and features historic gardens and houses located on the grounds, including Swan House, Smith Farm, and Wood Family Cabin. Atlanta History Center‚Äôs Midtown Campus includes the Margaret Mitchell House & Museum. The History Center‚Äôs research arm, Kenan Research Center, includes 3.5 million resources and a reproduction of historian Franklin Garrett's (1906‚Äì2000) office. Atlanta History Center holds one of the largest collections of Civil War artifacts in the United States. ==Exhibitions== Atlanta History Center operates three types of exhibitions: permanent, temporary, and traveling. === Permanent exhibitions: === * Atlanta '96: Shaping an Olympic and Paralympic City is Atlanta History Center‚Äôs latest permanent exhibit, expected to premiere in September 2020. This exhibit will focus on the impact of the Olympic Games on Atlanta and its citizens. It will examine what the games meant to different groups of people, from those involved in preparing for the event to those whose lives are still impacted by the games over 20 years later. * Cyclorama: The Big Picture was opened in February 2019, and features the fully restored cyclorama painting, The Battle of Atlanta. At the centerpiece of this new multimedia experience is a 132-year-old hand-painted work of art that stands 49 feet tall. Two levels of exhibitions look at truths and myths of the Civil War; explore the untold stories of the painting; examine the role movies and visual entertainment have on shaping perspectives of the Civil War; and provides a look at the fleeting entertainment sensation of cycloramas. * Locomotion: Railroads and the Making of Atlanta exhibition centers around the restored locomotive Texas, which was built in 1856 for the Western & Atlantic Railroad, which had established its terminus in 1837 at the site that became Atlanta. The other centerpiece in the Locomotion exhibition is the Zero Mile Post, one of the city‚Äôs most significant artifacts. Recently relocated to Atlanta History Center, the Zero Mile Post is the 1850s Western & Atlantic Railroad marker around which Atlanta grew. The detailed exhibition accompanying the Texas and Zero Mile Post interprets the major role railroads played in transforming Atlanta into the transportation hub and commercial center it is today. * Turning Point: The American Civil War exhibition contains 1,400 of Atlanta History Center's enormous collection of Civil War artifacts. Through original artifacts, including cannons, uniforms, swords, and other materials, visitors can better understand life during the Civil War. * Gatheround: Stories of Atlanta is an interactive exhibition that explores the various influential people and places that makeup Atlanta, as well as themes such as ‚ÄúPolitics and Policy; Cultural Life; Family and Community; and Urban Growth.‚Äù This exhibition shares the stories of individuals of many different backgrounds and perspectives who helped create the Atlanta we know today through artifacts, ephemera, interactive media, recording booths, immersive experiences, and dedicated spaces while setting the stage for Meet the Past museum theatre performances. * Shaping Traditions: Folk Arts in a Changing South exhibit shows the development and attributes of Southern folk art. It includes forms ranging from clothing and food to singing and storytelling and presents both the traditional and the modern. * Native Lands: Indians and Georgia shares the history and stories of the state‚Äôs original inhabitants beginning with the Mississippian peoples and continuing with their descendants, the Creeks and the Cherokees. Long before the first European settlers came to what is now called Georgia, the Mississippian Indians developed complex societies on these lands ‚Äì complete with art, music, ceremony, agriculture, architecture, and trade industries. Native Lands explores Indians‚Äô recent history and their continuing connections to Georgia through the voices of contemporary Creeks and Cherokees. * Fair Play: The Bobby Jones Story explores the life of Georgia's most famous golfer, Bobby Jones, and chronicles the early development of golf in the United States. For a career that launched six decades before the birth of Tiger Woods, Bobby Jones is credited with popularizing golf on an international stage. His 14-year playing career culminated in 1930 when he became the only golfer to achieve the Grand Slam by winning golf‚Äôs four major tournaments in the same year. * Mandarin Shutze: A Chinese Export Life exhibit tells the story of Philip Trammell Shutze, one of Atlanta's foremost architects, who was also known for his art collections. A Phillip Trammell Shutze designed house, the Swan House, is also on the grounds of Atlanta History Center. === Temporary Exhibitions: === * Any Great Change: The Centennial of the 19th Amendment which is open until Jan 31, 2021, commemorates the centennial of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (August 1920) and documents how women gained the vote and the ways they have used political power over the last century. The exhibition explores the decades-long struggle for women‚Äôs suffrage as well as the key groups, their strategies, and their leaders, including Emily C. MacDougald and her daughter, Emily Inman, owner of Swan House. * Black Citizenship in the Age of Jim Crow comes to Atlanta via the New York Historical Society and explores the African American struggle for full citizenship and racial equality that unfolded in the 50 years following the Civil War. The exhibition highlights the ways African Americans advocated for full inclusion in American democracy from 1865 through World War I. The exhibition features art, historical artifacts, photographs, and specially-created media pieces that illustrate transformative events in the past and their continuing relevance today. ==Historic Buildings== Smith FarmhouseSwan House at night === Main Campus: === * Smith Farm is an antebellum farmhouse built by the Robert Smith family and listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). It was originally a small farm in Dekalb County with 11 enslaved peoples, comprising 200 acres (0.81 km2). The house was moved to Atlanta History Center‚Äôs main campus in 1969, and it currently comprises the farmhouse, enslaved people‚Äôs cabin, kitchen, blacksmith shop, smokehouse, double corncrib, barn, and several gardens. The farmhouses several heritage breeds including angora goats and Gulf Coast sheep. * The Victorian and Lee playhouses are miniature houses. The Lee playhouse is located between McElreath Hall and Smith Farm. It was donated to Atlanta History Center in 1998. The Victorian Playhouse is located beside the Boxwood Garden. It was donated to Atlanta History Center in 1980 and has gone through six owners. * Swan House, also on the NRNP, was designed by Philip Trammell Shutze in the 1920s, and is named for the swam motif located above the home‚Äôs rear entrance. It is surrounded by the Boxwood Garden, based on Italian gardens as created in the 18th century England by Lord Burlington and William Kent. The front landscape, two cloverleaf fountains and a terraced lawn, comprise one of the most photographed places in Atlanta. * Wood Family Cabin is a log structure located within Swan Woods. It is used to interpret North Georgia settler and Native American life in the 1820s and 1830s, in the context of the Georgia land lotteries. Some of its logs were originally used for the home of Elias and Jane Wood, early settlers in the Piedmont region of Georgia (where today's Buckhead district in Atlanta is located). The original home was situated approximately two miles from the site of the Creek Indian settlement of Standing Peachtree and one mile south of the Chattahoochee River. The cabin was donated to Atlanta History Center by Dr. and Mrs. Carl Hartrampf Jr., descendants of the Wood family, in 2014. === Gouzeta Gardens: === * Olguita‚Äôs Garden is named after Goizueta Gardens namesake Olga ‚ÄúOlguita‚Äù C. de Goizueta. This ornamental garden is designed for the enjoyment of flowering and fragrant plants and is inspired by the great gardens of Europe, honoring Mrs. Goizueta‚Äôs love of English and French gardens. The small formal garden provides seating with a view to a water feature surrounded by limestone columns designed by Atlanta architect Neel Reid. The garden‚Äôs design and planting scheme reflect European influences on the Southeastern landscape and includes the entire garden fa√ßade of the Museum Building. * Mary Howard Gilbert Memorial Quarry Garden was once a granite quarry, and has been transformed into a garden behind the main building. This native garden contains herbal medicinal plants, waterfalls, and what is Georgia‚Äôs largest native plant collection in one place. Long-forgotten, the quarry was rediscovered in 1972 when the Atlanta History Center completed a survey of the property. It totals 25 feet deep and 3 acres in size. In the fifty years the quarry was abandoned, native trees sprang from the ground, and quick-growing shrubs and vines created a thick growth. Today, it is a sanctuary for native plants and the wildlife that depends on them. The Mary Howard Gilbert Memorial Quarry Garden shelters one of the state‚Äôs most comprehensive collections of plants native to pre-settlement Georgia, many of which are rare and/or endangered. * Smith Family Farm Gardens boasts a variety of heirloom plants, flowers, and heritage breeds at Smith Farm. The landscape represents Smith Farm in its early era, with historic varieties of crops in the fields, the enslaved people‚Äôs garden, the kitchen garden, and a swept yard by the house planted with heirloom flowers such as love-lies-bleeding (Amaranthus sp.) and rose campion (Lychnis coronaria). Surrounding the farm‚Äôs outbuildings are naturalistic, native plantings. Heritage-breed sheep, goats, chickens, and turkeys are representative of the types of livestock found on this type of farm. * Swan House Gardens are part of the Inman estate which was designed by Shutze from 1926‚Äì1928. At Swan House, as with many of his grand homes, Shutze designed the formal gardens that surround and showcase the Inman residence. * Frank A. Smith Memorial Rhododendron Garden‚Äôs contemporary design is rich with shade-loving plants that flourish in Atlanta, from giant elephant ears (Colocasia esculenta) to dainty peacock moss (Selaginella uncinata). An intimate pond and a dry streambed are bordered by an abundance of rhododendrons (Rhododendron spp. & cvs.), small flowering trees, and eclectic ground covers. * Sims Asian Garden provides a home to the Goizueta Gardens Asian Plant Collection. Benjamin H. Sims and his wife, Rebecca Wight Cherry Sims, were collectors of unusual and extraordinary Asian plants. Three major collection groups are on display in this garden: Satsuki azaleas, numerous varieties of hydrangea, and Japanese maples. Many of the Japanese maples in this garden are transplanted here directly from the Sims family's personal Japanese Garden. * Swan Woods and Wood Family Cabin encompasses acres of robust forest surrounding the cabin. Vestiges of terraced cotton fields abandoned a century ago are still visible and sightings of wildlife reward the watchful. Lying among the pine, beech and tulip trees is a Fern Circle which produces a collection of species of ferns and wildflowers native to the Georgia Piedmont. Also situated on the Swan Woods Trail is the Garden for Peace, part of an international gardens network dedicated to promoting peace. * Veterans Park is a celebratory gathering space that has been designed to inspire personal reflection, ignite profound connections with veterans and honor the lives of those who have made great sacrifices. With smartphone interaction, visitors can explore videos of veterans sharing their stories, memories, tragedies and triumphs of their great service to their country. Fountain scenery and seating locations with free wi-fi provide opportunities for small gatherings and peaceful personal tribute. Mitchell house === Midtown Campus: === * Located at the corner of 10th and Peachtree Streets, Atlanta History Center‚Äôs Midtown campus comprises the Margaret Mitchell House and Commercial Row, both of which are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Margaret Mitchell House was the home of Margaret Mitchell from 1925‚Äì1932 while she was writing the novel Gone With The Wind. Through guided tours of Margaret Mitchell‚Äôs apartment, guests can explore the complex issues raised by Gone With the Wind, and by Mitchell‚Äôs life. Along with interpretation about the house‚Äôs famous former resident, the Midtown Campus also serves as an accessible hub for community events, such as Author Talks, Atlanta United match viewing parties, Atlanta Pride events, and many others. ==History== Atlanta History Center was founded in 1926 as the Atlanta Historical Society (AHS). Initially, the society operated as an institution for historical discussion and appreciation but, by the next year, began publishing the Atlanta Historical Bulletin. The periodical was later named Atlanta History: A Journal of Georgia and the South and was published until 2006. The publication has since been digitized and is searchable on Atlanta History Center‚Äôs online database, Album. Walter McElreath an Atlanta lawyer, legislator, and author for whom the Center's McElreath Hall is named was the first leader of the Atlanta History Center. Other founders and early officers included Ruth Blair and Franklin Garrett. (Includes photo of Ruth Blair with Mayor Hartsfield and Franklin Garrett) In the early days the organization rented a ground floor space in the Atlanta Biltmore Hotel, and later a space in the Erlanger Theater building on Peachtree. In 1946 the group bought the Neel Reid designed Willis B. Jones home at the corner of Peachtree Street and Huntington Road as its headquarters. The Georgian mansion at 1753 Peachtree allowed the group to store and display its large collection of artifacts and photos. Lack of parking and maintenance issues on the Jones home sparked another search for a new headquarters. In 1966 the group used money from Walter McElreath's estate to purchase the 23-acre Swan House property on Andrews Drive. This property became the current main campus of the History Center. (After it was sold by the Society, the Jones home was rescued from demolition by others and coincidentally moved to 520 West Paces Ferry Road about one mile west of the current location of the Center) In 1986 the still relatively small group received the DuBose Collection of Civil War artifacts, donated by Mrs. Beverly M. DuBose Jr. In 1989, the Atlanta Historical Society built the current museum to house the DuBose collection. In 1990, the Atlanta Historical Society was renamed Atlanta History Center. The $15 million museum opened in 1993 with five exhibitions, including its first signature Atlanta history exhibition, Metropolitan Frontiers. An $11 million expansion, finished in 1996, added two new permanent exhibitions. The Kenan Research Center library was later expanded and the gardens reorganized, with a fourth permanent exhibition added, Down the Fairway with Bobby Jones. In 2014, the city of Atlanta announced its intentions to relocate the Battle of Atlanta Cyclorama and its artifacts to Atlanta History Center, including the antebellum Western & Atlantic locomotive, the Texas. The museum constructed an expansion to house the 360-degree panoramic painting, as well as the Texas locomotive, and other pieces in the Cyclorama collection. After a careful restoration, the Battle of Atlanta Cyclorama opened to the public February 22, 2019. ==Accessibility== Paved pathways through the historic gardens connect to Swan House and Smith Farm, but most paths are unpaved. Swan House has an elevator, allowing all visitors access to the second floor. Atlanta History Museum is ADA compliant, including the cyclorama viewing platform. Large-print books are available for a few exhibitions in the Atlanta History Museum and videos have subtitles. Maps are available in English, French, German, Japanese, and Spanish. ==References== == External links == * Atlanta History Center website * Atlanta History Center on Google Cultural Institute * Atlanta, Georgia, a National Park Service Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary Category:American Civil War museums in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Biographical museums in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Historic house museums in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:History centers Category:History museums in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Historical society museums in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Houses in Atlanta Category:Institutions accredited by the American Alliance of Museums Category:Museums in Atlanta Category:Museums established in 1926 Category:1926 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Atlanta History Center"},{"id":"1426908","text":"Basilica Cathedral of Arequipa The Basilica Cathedral of Arequipa (\\"Bas√≠lica Catedral\\", in Spanish) is located in the \\"Plaza de Armas\\" of the city of Arequipa, province of Arequipa, Peru. It is the most important Catholic church of the city and also of the larger Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Arequipa since it is the base of the Archbishop and the Metropolitan Council. The cathedral is also considered one of Peru's most unusual and famous colonial cathedrals since the Spanish conquest. ==Timeline== August 15, 1540: This is the date in which the city was founded by Garc√≠ Manuel de Carbajal. The Cathedral started construction on this very date. In the \\"Act of Foundation\\" of Arequipa, it can be read: \\"...in the name of its majesty Governor Francisco Pizarro, founded the beautiful village in the valley of Arequipa, in the Collasuyo section, above the river edge, in his name he put the cross, in the location signaled for the Church; He put the pike in the Plaza of the village, which he stated would do in the name of its majesty...\\" February 14, 1544: The representatives of the Council, Justice and Directorate of the city signed a contract with the architect Pedro God√≠nez, then regent of the city and commander of San Juan Bautista de Characato, and the carpenters Juan Rodr√≠guez and Gregorio √Ålvarez to build the church. September 1544: Miguel Cornejo, the Mayor of the City, assigned the building of the portal to the master Toribio de Alcaraz, who agreed to build it using white petrified volcanic lava (sillar). The church is built with 2 main sections. January 22, 1583: An earthquake reduced the church to rubble. 1590: It is decided to rebuild again the main church, and this is assigned to Gaspar B√°ez, who is helped by several Spanish officials and many hundreds of \\"Mitayo\\" Indians. The new design would have 3 sections, arcs and vaults of brick. February 1600: When construction was almost finished, the violent eruption of the Huaynaputina stratovolcano (also known as Quinistaquillas or Omate), together with several earthquakes and a rain of ash, destroyed part of the structure. 1604: Another earthquake completely destroyed what was remaining of the structure. 1609: The Bula of Pope Paul V created the Arequipa Diocese, separating it from the one in Cuzco. The Arequipan Catholics had become impoverished since the Volcano eruption, but decided to rebuild the Cathedral. January 27, 1621: Mr. Andr√©s de Espinoza was assigned the construction of the Cathedral. 1628: Espinoza died. 1656: The construction of the Cathedral was finished. It had 3 sections, 180 feet long by 84 feet wide (84.86 m by 25.6 m), 8 pillars, 5 chapels, 22 arcs, 15 brick vaults. 1666: Earthquake. Some damage, but no structural damage. Reconstruction started immediately. 1668: Earthquake. Some damage, but no structural damage. Reconstruction started immediately. 1687: Earthquake. Some damage, but no structural damage. Reconstruction started immediately. 1784: Earthquake. Some damage, but no structural damage. Reconstruction started immediately. December 1, 1844: There was a fire in the Cathedral. The fire destroyed several parts of the church and many paintings, sculptures and furniture pieces, as well as several vaults and pillars. December 15, 1844: Present reconstruction work was made, under the direction of the Bishop Jos√© Sebasti√°n de Goyeneche y Barreda, and his brother Juan Mariano de Goyeneche. Technical direction was under the architect Lucas Pobrete. In this restoration it was enlarged reaching the place of the old San Juan church (destroyed in 1784). 1850: The Bishop Goyeneche assigned the production of several jewelry pieces to adorn the Cathedral to the Spanish jeweler Francisco de Moratilla, who was then jeweler of the Queen of Spain. The nephews of the Bishop (the count of Guaqui, the duchesses of Goyeneche and Gamio and Jose Sebastian de Goyeneche) gave the Cathedral the main altar (still exists today) which was installed by an Italian architect of last name Guido. 1854: The clock of the tower, made in England, was installed. Also the music organ and twelve giant wood sculptures, all made in Belgium, of the apostles. 1879: The pulpit, made at the shop of Buisine-Rigot in Lille, France, was installed thanks to the Peruvian ambassador in France, Mr. Juan Mariano de Goyeneche, count of Guaqui. It was given to the church by Javiera Liz√°rraga de Alvarez Comparet. August 13, 1868: A violent and long earthquake destroyed several parts of the Cathedral: The towers, part of the main portal, some of the facade arcs, some altars. In the following years, thanks to the Bishop and the Goyeneche family and under the technical direction of Lucas Pobrete, the two towers and the facade arcs were rebuilt. June 23, 2001: The 2001 southern Peru earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale on June 23. The left tower was destroyed and the right tower suffered major damage.

The Act establishes a single integrated scheme for licensing premises in England and Wales (only) which are used for the sale or supply of alcohol, to provide regulated entertainment, or to provide late night refreshment. Permission to carry on some or all of these licensable activities is now contained in a single licence -- the premises licence -- replacing several different and complex schemes. Responsibility for issuing licences now rests with local authorities, specifically London boroughs, Metropolitan boroughs, unitary authorities, and district councils, who took over this power from the Justices of the Peace. These authorities are each required to establish a Licensing Committee. The powers of the Act came fully into force at midnight at the start of 24 November 2005. ==Key measures of the Act== Key measures contained in the Act include: ; Flexible opening hours : Flexible opening hours for licensed premises, with the potential for up to 24 hour opening, seven days a week, will now be available. As well as the flexibility, the granting of these new type of licences is to be, for the first time, subject to consideration of the impact on local residents, businesses, and the expert opinion of a range of authorities in relation to the licensing objectives. This flexibility is intended to minimise public disorder resulting from a set closing time whereby numerous intoxicated individuals may leave licensed premises simultaneously at 23:00. It is also an effort to decrease the culture of \\"binge-drinking\\". ; Single premises licences : The single integrated premises licence, bringing together the six existing licensing regimes (for alcohol, public entertainment, cinemas, theatres, late night refreshment houses, and night caf√©s) with the intention of cutting down on bureaucracy and simplifying such provision. ; Personal licences : A new system of personal licences relating to the supply of alcohol is to be introduced. This will enable licence holders to move more freely between premises where a premises licence is in force than is currently the case. ==Licensing Committee== Each local authority must set up a Licensing Committee with between ten and fifteen members. It is envisaged that most member level decisions will be made by a sub-committee of three. The Committee can and should have a scheme of delegation for different types of decision; this means that many applications will be decided by officers. The full Committee is expected to receive monitoring reports. The Committee is not regarded as quasi-judicial ( Hope and Glory Public House Ltd, R v City of Westminster Magistrates Court & Ors [2011] EWCA Civ 31). The Committee should make its decisions in accordance with the principles of natural justice and with regard to the Human Rights Act 1998 (Articles 1, 6 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights are likely to be engaged). It has been suggested that councillors should not be involved in any way in decisions on premises in their ward, and the Standards Board for England has advised that only councillors who are members of the Committee should have any role in considering applications. Licensing objectives The Licensing Act sets out four licensing objectives of no preferential order which must be taken into account and adhered to. They are: 1\\\\. the prevention of crime and disorder, 2\\\\. public safety, 3\\\\. prevention of public nuisance, and 4\\\\. the protection of children from harm (In Scotland there is a fifth licensing objective - protecting and improving public health) ==Licensable activities== The Act defines \\"licensable activities\\" as: * the retail sale of alcohol, * the supply of alcohol in clubs, * the provision of late night refreshment, and * the provision of regulated entertainment In turn, \\"regulated entertainment\\" is defined as: * a performance of a play, * an exhibition of a film, * an indoor sporting event, * a boxing or wrestling entertainment (both indoors and outdoors), * a performance of live music, * any playing of recorded music, or * a performance of dance in the presence of an audience (which may be just one person). There are exceptions (e.g., Morris dancing and similar) and refinements (e.g., Karaoke is considered to be music). \\"Late night refreshment\\" is defined as the supply of hot food or drink (that is, food or drink that is either served at, or has been heated on the premises to, a point above ambient temperature) to the public for consumption, both on or off the premises, between 23:00 and 05:00. ==Premises licences== A premises licence is required for any premises offering licensable activities. However, once a licence is granted it is valid until it is either surrendered or lapses in accordance with the Act, in contrast to the predecessor schemes which generally had to be renewed annually. The application for a premises licence requires the completion of an operating schedule and the offering of conditions to be included on the premises licence and a plan of the premises. A premises licence that includes the sale of alcohol must name an individual who holds a personal licence granted under the Act. This person is known as the designated premises supervisor (DPS) and must sign a consent form consenting to being named as that DPS. Applicants must serve a copy of the application on the licensing authority (the council), the police, the fire authority, the body of responsible for health and safety enforcement, the body responsible for dealing with pollution (Environmental Health) a body responsible for advising on Child Protection issues, the planning authority and the weights and measures/trading standards authority. These bodies are all known as Responsible Authorities. Responsible Authorities are able to make representations to the licensing authority about an application. The application must also be advertised by way of a blue notice displayed on or near to the premises for 28 days and in a local newspaper on one working day within ten working days of making the application. In addition to the Responsible Authorities the Act now allows for any \\"other person\\" to make representations. If representation is made, the licensing authority must hold a hearing in most cases. After the hearing, the authority can make one of five decisions: to grant the licence with conditions that match the operating schedule (and conditions can be added); to exclude some licensable activities from the application; to refuse to accept the person specified as designated premises supervisor (but only on police advice); to approve different part of the premises for different activities; or to reject the application entirely. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal to the Magistrates' Court; unusually, an interested third party who disagrees with a decision to grant a licence can also appeal against the council's decision. Any person or responsible authority can apply to the licensing authority for a review of an existing premises licence, with the aim of amending its conditions or revoking it entirely. ==Cumulative Impact Policy== Although not specifically referred to in the original Act, guidance provided for the establishment of special areas of cumulative impact (Cumulative Impact Zones.Guidance issued under section 182 of the Licensing Act 2003, chapter 13 This allowed Licensing Authorities to designate such an area where there is evidence that accumulation of licensed premises in it may cause one or more of the licensing objectives to be undermined if further licences are granted. \\"The effect of adopting a special policy of this kind is to create a rebuttable presumption that applications for new premises licences or club premises certificates or variations that are likely to add to the existing cumulative impact will normally be refused, following relevant representations, unless the applicant can demonstrate in their operating schedule that there will be no negative cumulative impact on one or more of the licensing objectives.\\"Guidance issued under section 182 of the Licensing Act 2003, .para.13.29 A research study in the London Borough of Southwark found no evidence that CIZ establishment reduced the number of successful applications nor impacted on the relative proportion of licence applications receiving objections. Cumulative Impact Assessments were formally included in the Act (as Section 5A) by the Policing and Crime Act 2017. ==Personal licences== A personal licence allows a person to sell alcohol, or authorise the sale of alcohol, under the authority of a premises license. Anyone can apply for a personal licence to the licensing authority for the area in which they live. They need to show they have a licensing qualification and a criminal record clean of relevant offences. The local authority can only refuse such an application on police advice. The licence lasts indefinitely after changes to legislation where it was required to be renewed every 10 years. Anyone who already had a licence under the previous licensing schemes in their name - typically a pub landlord - was able to get a licence without having to have a qualification; this was known as the grandfather right. If an applicant does not live within a local authority's area, they can apply to any authority of their choice. ==Temporary event notices== Any person over 18 can serve the local authority and local police with a temporary event notice (TEN) for an event which would normally need a premises licence, but which would be for a maximum period of 168 hours, and would be for a maximum number of 499 people. Examples of events that could be covered by a TEN might be where a pub wants to stay open all weekend for a special occasion, but does not want to apply for, or cannot get, a licence allowing this all the time; or a beer tent in a summer fair. TENs also cover licensing over alcohol to clubs, entertainment or late night refreshment (serving hot food between 11pm and 5am). Currently a notice costs ¬£21.00. TENs must be submitted at least ten working days before an event is due to start; notice is given to the council responsible for the area to which the event is to be held. A copy of this notice must be sent to the police that cover that area and to the Environmental Health department. The police and environmental health have 3 working days to make an objection. Anyone who does not have a personal licence can give only five notices a year, while a personal licence holder can give 50. A TEN can only be given in respect of the same premises fifteen times in a calendar year. On 25 April 2012 a late TEN was introduced. This can be submitted between five and nine working days before the event and should only be used when unforeseen circumstances lead to short notice. There is no need for permission for a temporary event; the prospective premises user merely has to formally notify the council and police that the event will take place. So long as the criteria noted above are met (as well as any others that may apply, for example, if alcohol is being sold, that provisions are in place to stop under 18s from buying it) and the police have no objections, the event can go ahead. The council cannot impose any further conditions, limitations or restrictions. However, if the authority is convinced that any of the above limits will be exceeded, or they uphold a police objection (which can only be made on the grounds of crime prevention), they will issue a counter-notice which has the effect of cancelling the temporary event notice. ==Children and the Act== The Act also makes a few important changes to the current law regarding children and alcohol, although these were not publicised at the time. For instance, a rule allowing children under eighteen years of age to sell alcohol in supermarkets was extended to all licensees, as long as \\"the sale or supply has been specifically approved by that or another responsible person\\", thus making it legal for under-18s to work on a bar. Children working behind bars is however controlled by other legislation such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. It was also made a criminal offence for someone under the age of eighteen to attempt to purchase alcohol for the first time in English law, punishable by a fine of up to ¬£1,000 (or level 3 on the standard scale). ==Reaction to the Act== The Act has caused some controversy. On one side of the argument is the frustration some British drinkers and many tourists have with the traditional closing time of 23:00, as opposed to the more liberal drinking regulations of continental Europe and further afield. They believe that a liberalisation of the drinking-up time will reduce 'drinking against the clock', a precursor to binge drinking. Those against the legislation, on the other hand, believe that binge drinking will increase, as drinkers will have more time to get drunk. ===Impact on live music=== The new requirement that there be a licence for the playing of live music in any venue no matter how small has been criticized for reducing the number of places where artists can play to tiny audiences. There have been press stories about how the law unreasonably singles out the playing of musical instruments when compared to other forms of entertainment, such as circus performing. To deal with the concerns raised, the Live Music Forum was set up, chaired by Feargal Sharkey. Its report,Department for Culture Media and Sport - The Live Music Forum delivers its verdict - \\"Small scale live music events impacted on by new licensing laws\\" - Sharkey issued in July 2007, reported that overall \\"the Licensing Act has had a neutral effect on the UK‚Äôs live music scene\\", but recommended there should be more flexibility of the application of the Act on smaller premises. However the introduction of Form 696 by the Metropolitan Police Service as part of the licensing system for live music has been criticised by Sharkey and others for the restrictions imposed on music promoters in London. The concerns raised led to the Live Music Act 2012 which has resulted in Live Music being delicensed in certain circumstances. ==Implementation of the Act== Any premises that had an old-scheme licence were able to apply for that licence to be converted; provided there was no material change in the use of the premises, the local authority was effectively bound to agree this. Licensees had to apply for this by 6 August 2005. At that date, it was reported that most pubs had applied, but many off-licences had not. Although the right to \\"convert\\" current licences expired on 6 August, premises could still apply as \\"new\\" premises, without benefit of \\"grandfather rights\\". The new licensing laws came into effect at midnight at the end of Wednesday 23 November 2005, with old licensing regimes ending and new licences coming into force. In a report on the new legislation in November 2006, the Institute of Alcohol Studies reported that one year after implementation \\"opinions were divided, as expected, leading to the unavoidable polarisation of the debate, increasingly centred upon the misguided notion of ‚Äò24 hour drinking‚Äô.\\" On 8 November 2007 the Department for Culture, Media and Sport reported that there were 176,400 licensed premises in England and Wales. Only 5,100 premises have 24 hour licences, most of which (65 per cent) are hotel bars. Only 460 pubs, bars or nightclubs have 24 hour licences. ==See also== *Zoo Bar (Halifax, West Yorkshire) - The first establishment to be closed under the auspices of the Act. ==References== ==External links== *The Licensing Act 2003, as amended from the National Archives. *The Licensing Act 2003, as originally enacted from the National Archives. *Explanatory notes to the Licensing Act 2003. *Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) *Proposed changes to the Licensing Act 2003 (Home Office) *Article on the Licensing Act in Web Journal of Current Legal Issues Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 2003 Category:Alcohol law in the United Kingdom ","title":"Licensing Act 2003"},{"id":"1426930","text":"Bungoma is a town in Bungoma County of Kenya, bordered by Uganda in the west.

It is one of several ethnically Luhya dialects; however, it is more closely related to the Gisu dialect of Masaaba in eastern Uganda (and to the other Luhya dialect of Tachoni) than it is to other languages spoken by the Luhya. ==Phonology== {class=\\"IPA \\" p  t É k - (b) (d) (d í) (…°) - f s  x - Œ≤    - m n …≤ ≈ã -  l r j w } Several consonants undergo fortition after nasal consonants: ; Mutonyi (2000) postulates that Bukusu has no phonemic voiced plosives.Jeff Mielke, 2008. The emergence of distinctive features, p 141‚Äì142 ==Variations== The language has three main variations: *The dialect spoken north of Kimilili area, with its heaviest influence being noted in the region around Kitale *The dialect spoken west of Webuye town, with its purest form being in the region around, and to the west of, Bungoma *The dialect spoken east of Webuye town, extending into Kakamega and Lugari districts. Of these, the language spoken around Kitale town is usually considered the purest form - this is because the other two dialects are significantly influenced by other dialects of the Luhya languages. ===Influences=== The Bukusu tribe lives in Bungoma district, which borders Uganda to the west and Kakamega district of Kenya to the east. Across the border in Uganda live the Masaba and the Gisu, both closely related to the Bukusu by a shared language and a common culture. Intermarriage between the Bukusu and these Ugandan tribes is very common and is, in fact, encouraged by the respective communities. As a result, many Bukusu have close relatives among the Gisu and Masaaba, and vice versa. During the Ugandan civil wars of the 1970s, many of the Gisu and Masaba left Uganda for Kenya, mainly to live with Bukusu relatives around the Bungoma area. After the wars ended, a large number did not return to Uganda, having already started new lives in Kenya. Their large dispersal among the Bukusu in that area has had a discernible influence on the Bukusu language in the Bungoma region. Native speakers of the language will easily identify someone from the area based on their speech. Of particular note is the substitution of R with L, so that, for example, the verb 'khuufwara' (xuufwara) - to wear [clothes] is now pronounced 'khuufwala', as it is in the Gisu and Masaaba languages. The dialect spoken east of Webuye town is influenced by the neighbouring Kabras and Tachoni dialects of the Luhya language. This is particularly noticeable in the changes in noun prefixes: in the original Bukusu language, for example, the term 'something' would be rendered as 'siSindu'. In the Kabras language, the term is rendered as 'eShindu'. The Bukusu east of Webuye town will usually say 'eSindu', thus adopting the prefix of the Kabras language while retaining the Bukusu root word 'Sindu' (as opposed to the Kabras root word, 'Shindu'). Because it borders the nilotic Kalenjin languages of the Pokot, Nandi and Sebei to the north, east and west, the Bukusu language spoken in Kitale area has largely retained its original form, save for a number of loan words from those languages. It is markedly different from the other dialects discussed above, to the extent that it takes a while for a native speaker of one of the other two dialects to adopt it as their daily speech. ==See also== * Luhya languages ==Bibliography== * De Blois, Kornelis Frans (1975) 'Bukusu generative phonology and aspects of Bantu structure' (Annales de MRAC, no. 85).

Meekatharra is a Yamatji word meaning \\"place of little water\\". At the 2016 census, Meekatharra had a population of 708, with 34.0% being of Aboriginal descent. Meekatharra is a major supply centre for the pastoral and mining area in the Murchison region of Western Australia. It is located north-east of Perth and may be reached by the Great Northern Highway. It is a centre for sheep and cattle transshipment, initially by rail but now by road trains. It is also a regional home to the Royal Flying Doctor Service and the School of the Air. It is connected by public transport to Geraldton with connections to Perth via Transwa coach service N4. No viable horticultural industry exists in the area, although extensive but poor cattle stations in the Murchison and Gascoyne exist. Meekatharra underwent a significant gold rush during the mining boom of the 1980s, with mining continuing until May 2004 at St Barbara Mines's Bluebird Gold Mine. Exploration restarted in the area and St Barbara sold out to a company known as Mercator Gold in October 2005.Proposed Meekatharra Asset Acquisition from St Barbara Mines Limited Mercator website, published: 3 November 2005, accessed: 13 January 2010 Mercator Gold then conducted an extensive drilling programme and re-opened the mill, commencing production in early October 2007.Final Results Year Ended 30 June 2008 Mercator website, Published: 1 April 2009, accessed: 13 January 2010 This mining phase however was short lived, with Mercator going into administration in October 2008Statement re Suspension Mercator website, Published: 9 October 2008, accessed: 13 January 2010 and closing the mine.Trading Statement & Interim Results for the 12 month to 30 June 2009 Mercator website, Published: 31 December 2009, accessed: 13 January 2010 ==History== Meekatharra is a former gold rush town. It seems the first settlement at Meekatharra occurred in 1894 and that, in May 1896, after the prospectors Meehan, Porter and Soich discovered gold, miners moved to the new settlement from the other East Murchison fields and mining grew rapidly in scale and sophistication. The Peak Hill mining town was founded in 1892 approximately 100 km up the road during this initial gold rush. Success on the Meekatharra field was short-lived. It was only because a second gold discovery occurred in 1899 that the town survived. In 1901 the Meekatharra State Battery began operation and by Christmas Day 1903 the township had been officially gazetted. In 1906 Alfred Wernam Canning was appointed to develop a stock route from the East Kimberley to the Murchison. The stock route, comprising 54 wells, was completed in 1908 and, when the railway arrived in Meekatharra in 1910, the town became the railhead at the end of the route. In many ways the railway ensured the town's survival. In 1910 it took the first shipment of wool out of the area and it continued to serve the local pastoral interests until it was closed down in 1978. The town and surrounding stations were isolated by flood waters in 1926 resulting in provisions in the town running low after supplies were unable to get through after a week. From 1927 until 1931, a railway line operated from Meekatharra to the manganese mine at Horseshoe, some 80 miles (128 km) distant.Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, August 1984, pp 183-189 A substantial gold deposit which lies just south of the townsite called the Paddy's Flat area was explored and mined by Western Mining Corporation and Dominion Mining Ltd in the 1990s. ==Climate== The climate is hot and dry. The annual rainfall is between . The driest months of the year are August through to November. ==Transport== Meekatharra was an important location in the Western Australian Government Railways system - being the northernmost location in the Northern Railway railway network, apart from the isolated Marble Bar Railway branch out of Port Hedland. For a while a further branch line continued eastwards to Wiluna. The line was closed from Mullewa and pulled up in the 1970s. In the 2000s, new iron ore prospects may see the railway return.Golden West Resources  Wiluna West Iron Project A runway, now known as Meekatharra Airport, was built by the Americans during World War II.

The PGA's membership includes over 7,000 members of the producing establishment worldwide. Its co-presidents are Gail Berman & Lucy Fisher. The PGA is overseen by a National Board of Directors. Vance Van Petten has served as the organization's National Executive Director since 2000. Susan Sprung joined him in that position in 2019. The Producers Guild of America offers several benefits to its members, including health insurance and pension benefits; seminars and mentoring programs; entrance to special screenings of movies during Oscar season; and assistance with working conditions and screen credits. As of 2015, the gender ratio of the PGA's membership is 57% male and 43% female. ==History== The Producers Guild of America began as two separate organizations, with the Screen Producers Guild being formed on May 16, 1950. Its first president was William Perlberg. In 1957, television producers followed suit, forming the Television Producers Guild, with Ben Brady as its first president. These merged in 1962 to form the PGA under producer Walter Mirisch. Subsequent Presidents of the PGA have included Stanley Rubin, Leonard B. Stern, Kathleen Kennedy, Marshall Herskovitz, and the teams of Hawk Koch / Mark Gordon, and Gary Lucchesi / Lori McCreary. The Golden Laurel Awards (subsequently renamed the Producers Guild of America Awards, a.k.a. PGA Awards) were first held in 1990, establishing the Guild Awards as one of the bellwethers for the Academy Awards. 20 of the 29 winners of the Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture have gone on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. The Producers Guild of America's awards show was originally established in 1990 as the Golden Laurel Awards, created by PGA Treasurer Joel Freeman, Diane Robison, Terrie Frankel, Bernard Wiesen, and Charles B. FitzSimons with the support of Guild President Leonard B. Stern, in order to honor the visionaries who produce and execute motion picture and television product. The ceremony has been hosted each year by celebrity host/presenters, including Ronald Reagan, Ted Turner, Garry Marshall, Jack Lemmon, James Earl Jones, Grant Tinker, Michael Douglas, Walter Matthau, Shirley MacLaine, Marlo Thomas, Kevin Spacey, Mark Wahlberg, Kerry Washington, Anne Hathaway, Steve Carell, Neil Patrick Harris and Jennifer Lawrence, among others. This photo is of the Committee who formed the 1st Producers Guild of America Golden Laurel Awards (now called the Producers Guild of America Awards) in 1990, taken at the ceremony that was held at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel; From left to right: Betty Freeman, Producers Guild of America Members: Terrie Frankel (white jacket), Joel Freeman, Charles B. FitzSimons, Diane Robison, Leonard B. Stern (President), and Bernard Wiesen. In 2001, the Producers Guild of America merged with the American Association of Producers (AAP), enabling the Guild to represent all members of the producing team. Since that time, the Guild has been composed of three Councils: The Producers Council (representing producers, executive producers and co-producers), the AP Council (representing associate producers, production managers, production supervisors, segment and field producers, production coordinators, visual effects producers, and post-production staff) and the New Media Council. In 2001, producers John Schwally and Nelle Nugent established the Producers Guild of America East Regional Chapter of the Guild, located in New York and servicing Guild members based on the East Coast. Since 2012, Peter Saraf has served as chair of the region. In 2002, the Producers Guild established its New Media Council to recognize and represent producers working outside traditional television and film formats including, but not limited to, games (console, online and mobile), digital effects, digital animation, broadband and mobile storytelling, and more recently virtual reality, augmented reality and location-based attractions. The Producers Guild of America has an international committee aimed towards connecting producers across nations in creative industries. Founded by Stuart J. Levy, Nicholas de Wolff, and William Stuart, it is presently co-chaired by Elizabeth Dell and Kayvan Mashayekh. On January 19, 2018, the Producers Guild of America adopted new sexual harassment guidelines. == The Producers Mark (p.g.a.)== In 2012, the Producers Guild introduced the \\"Producers Mark\\", a certification mark to feature film credits, allowing approved producers to add the lowercase initials p.g.a. following their \\"Produced By\\" credit. Unlike other post- nominal letters that appear in motion picture credits (e.g., A.C.E., C.S.A.), the \\"Producers Mark\\" does not indicate membership in the Producers Guild. Rather, it certifies that the credited producer performed a major portion of the producing duties on a motion picture. The Mark is licensed for use in motion picture credits on a film-by-film basis. A producer's having received the Mark on a prior film has no impact on the decision to certify a current or future credit with the \\"Producers Mark\\". During 2012 and 2013, Producers Guild of America Presidents Hawk Koch and Mark Gordon conducted negotiations and secured separate agreements with every major Hollywood studio requiring the studios to submit any films they developed and produced internally for \\"Producers Mark\\" certification. The first film to be released with the \\"Producers Mark\\" was The Magic of Belle Isle (which certified producers Lori McCreary, Alan Greisman, and Rob Reiner with the Mark), followed almost immediately thereafter by Lawless (which certified producers Lucy Fisher and Douglas Wick). Since that time, hundreds of motion pictures have had their credits certified via the \\"Producers Mark\\". The Producers Guild determines which credited producers are eligible for certification via a thorough vetting process, requiring initial application from the film's owner/distributor and candid input from its producers, as well as numerous third party sources, which may include the film's director, writers, editors, cinematographer or other department heads. The Guild uses the same process to recommend which producers are eligible for producing honors and awards, including the Guild's \\"Darryl F. Zanuck Award\\" and the Academy Award for Best Picture given by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Any copyright owner of a film that has an established U.S. distributor may apply for the \\"Producers Mark\\", but application for and use of the \\"Producers Mark\\" by individual producers is purely voluntary. ==New Media Council== In 2002, the New Media Council was formed by the Producers Guild of America in order to recognize, represent, and protect producers working in digital and emerging media such as broadband and mobile entertainment, video games, digital visual effects, interactive television and DVDs. In January 2001, following a series of summits that brought together members of the New Media and traditional producing communities, producer Marc Levey spearheaded an initiative to revise the Producers Guild of America constitution to provide for the representation of New Media producers. This led to the formation of the New Media Council. Since its formation, the Council has sought to identify and address issues relevant to New Media and the PGA. These include how \\"New Media\\" should be defined and how the role of a New Media producer differs from or is similar to its counterpart in traditional media, recognizing that medium must serve the story and not the other way around. On April 5, 2010, the Producers Guild of America Board of Directors officially approved its New Media Code of Credits, adding twenty-six major new credits to cover New Media producers. The code is significant in that it marks the first time the Producers Guild of America recognized New Media producer industry credits and responsibilities in Broadband, DVD/Blu-ray, Animation, Games (console and online), Mobile, Digital Visual Effects, iTV (interactive/enhanced Television), Special Venues, and Transmedia. ==Produced By Conference== Since 2009, the Producers Guild has presented the \\"Produced By Conference\\", held annually in June on a studio lot in the Los Angeles area. In 2011, the Conference was held at Disney/ABC Studios. Each Conference offers a variety of educational sessions designed to promote the newest information about the state of the entertainment industry marketplace and allow experienced producers to share the benefit of their experience with emerging professionals. The \\"Produced By Conference\\" also offers a variety of other programs, including extensive vendor displays and technology demonstrations, numerous representatives of local, state and international film commissions, small-group Mentoring Roundtable discussions, and a variety of networking events, including the traditional Friday night Kick-Off Party. Speakers at past conferences have included James Cameron, Clint Eastwood, Mark Cuban, Ted Turner, Gale Anne Hurd, Marshall Herskovitz, Mark Gordon, Hawk Koch, Alan Ball, Kathleen Kennedy, Matthew Weiner, Richard D. Zanuck, James L. Brooks, Douglas Wick, Lucy Fisher, Roger Corman, Norman Lear, Lawrence Gordon, Francis Ford Coppola, Seth Rogen, Kevin Smith, and Lauren Shuler Donner. In 2011, the \\"Produced By Conference\\" was presented in association with AFCI Locations. Since 2014, the Producers Guild of America has presented \\"Produced By: New York\\", a single-day conference event held annually in New York City. Speakers and guests at \\"Produced By: New York\\" have included Michael Moore, Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu, Jake Gyllenhaal, Donna Gigliotti, James Schamus, Jenni Konner, Darren Aronofsky, Barbara Hall and Cathy Schulman, among others. ==Producers Guild Award== In 1990, the Producers Guild held the first-ever Golden Laurel Awards, which were renamed the Producers Guild Awards in 2002. Richard D. Zanuck and Lili Fini Zanuck received the award for Driving Miss Daisy, which also won the Academy Award for Best Picture. ===Film winners=== ====2018 winners==== * Theatrical Motion Picture : * The Shape of Water :: Guillermo del Toro and J.

FitzSimons Honorary Lifetime Membership Award== For \\"outstanding contribution and enduring dedication to the Producers Guild of America\\". The Charles B. FitzSimons Honorary Lifetime Membership Award originated in 1991 during the planning of the Guild's 2nd Golden Laurel Awards at the Smoke House in Burbank, across from the Warner Brothers Studios. Terrie Frankel suggested a new award, the Charles B. FitzSimons Honorary Lifetime Membership Award would be given to a member who gave outstanding contributions to the Guild. The first recipient was a surprised Charles B. FitzSimons at the Award Ceremonies at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.

The award is presented to recipients at the Guild's annual membership meeting and entitles recipients to join the Council's Leadership Roundtable. Past recipients of this award include: * 2006: James Fino, Cindy A.

In 1999, Levey began to spearhead a three- year process within the Producers Guild to recognize, represent and protect the interests of producers working outside the \\"traditional\\" formats of television and film. Levey's vision and leadership resulted in the official amendment of the PGA's Constitution and the establishment of the Guild's New Media Council. In recognition of his efforts, the Guild officially established this annual service award in his name. ==See also== * Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers ==References== ==External links== * Category:Entertainment industry societies Category:Film organizations in the United States Category:Organizations established in 1962 Category:Guilds in the United States ","title":"Producers Guild of America"},{"id":"1426950","text":"Hieronim Jarosz Sieniawski (c. 1516‚Äì1579) was a Polish noble.

He was awarded the Military Cross, when he assumed command of a group of American soldiers who had lost their officers during the Battle of the Hindenburg Line, and became the only official Australian photographer from any war to receive a combat medal. He narrowly failed in an attempt to be the first to cross under the North Pole in a submarine, but was able to prove that submarines were capable of operating beneath the polar ice cap, thereby paving the way for future successful missions. The US Navy later took his ashes to the North Pole aboard the submarine USS Skate on 17 March 1959. ==Early life== Hubert Wilkins was a native of Hallett, South Australia, the last of 13 children in a family of pioneer settlers and sheep farmers. He was born at Mount Bryan, South Australia, north of Adelaide by road. The original homestead has been restored by generous donation. He was educated at Mount Bryan East and the Adelaide School of Mines. As a teenager, he moved to Adelaide where he found work with a traveling cinema, to Sydney as a cinematographer, and thence to England where he became a pioneering aerial photographer whilst working for Gaumont Studios. His photographic skill earned him a place on various Arctic expeditions, including the controversial 1913 Vilhjalmur Stefansson-led Canadian Arctic Expedition. ==World War I== In 1917, Wilkins returned to his native Australia, joining the Australian Flying Corps in the rank of second lieutenant. Wilkins later transferred to the general list and in 1918 was appointed as an official war photographer. In June 1918 Wilkins was awarded the Military Cross for his efforts to rescue wounded soldiers during the Third Battle of Ypres. He remains the only Australian official photographer from any war to have received a combat medal. The following month Wilkins was promoted to Captain and became officer commanding No.3 (Photographic) Sub-section of the Australian war records unit. Wilkins' work frequently led him into the thick of the fighting and during the Battle of the Hindenburg Line he assumed command of a group of American soldiers who had lost their officers in an earlier attack, directing them until support arrived. Wilkins was subsequently awarded a bar to his Military Cross in the 1919 Birthday Honours. When Sir John Monash was asked by the visiting American journalist Lowell Thomas (who had written With Lawrence in Arabia and made him an international hero) if Australia had a similar hero, Monash spoke of Wilkins: \\"Yes, there was one. He was a highly accomplished and absolutely fearless combat photographer. What happened to him is a story of epic proportions. Wounded many times ... he always came through. At times he brought in the wounded, at other times he supplied vital intelligence of enemy activity he observed. At one point he even rallied troops as a combat officer ... His record was unique.\\"Thomas, Lowell, Sir Hubert Wilkins: his world of adventurer, Readers Book Club, London, 1961, p.1. ==Early career and personal life== Detroit Arctic Expedition, 1926 After the war, Wilkins served in 1921‚Äì22 as an ornithologist aboard the Quest on the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition to the Southern Ocean and adjacent islands. Wilkins in 1923 began a two-year study for the British Museum of the bird life of Northern Australia. This ornithology project occupied his life until 1925. His work was greatly acclaimed by the museum but derided by Australian authorities because of the sympathetic treatment afforded to Indigenous Australians and criticisms of the ongoing environmental damage in the country. In March 1927, Wilkins and pilot Carl Ben Eielson explored the drift ice north of Alaska, touching down upon it in Eielson's airplane in the first land-plane descent onto drift ice. Soundings taken at the landing site indicated a water depth of 16,000 feet, and Wilkins hypothesized from the experience that future Arctic expeditions would take advantage of the wide expanses of open ice to use aircraft in exploration.Althoff, William F. Drift Station: Arctic outposts of superpower science. Potomac Books Inc., Dulles, Virginia. 2007. p. 35. Wilkins was the first recipient of the Samuel Finley Breese Morse Medal, which was awarded to him by the American Geographical Society in 1928.\\"The Cullum Geographical Medal\\" . American Geographical Society. Retrieved 17 June 2010. He was also awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Patron's Gold Medal the same year. On 15 April 1928, a year after Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic, Wilkins and Eielson made a trans-Arctic crossing from Point Barrow, Alaska, to Spitsbergen, arriving about 20 hours later on 16 April, touching along the way at Grant Land on Ellesmere Island. For this feat and his prior work, Wilkins was knighted, and during the ensuing celebration in New York, he met an Australian actress, Suzanne Bennett, whom he later married. Now financed by William Randolph Hearst, Wilkins continued his polar explorations, flying over Antarctica in the San Francisco. He named the island of Hearst Land after his sponsor, and Hearst thanked Wilkins by giving him and his bride a flight aboard Graf Zeppelin. ==Preparations for the Nautilus expedition== In 1930 Wilkins and his wife, Suzanne, were vacationing with a wealthy friend and colleague Lincoln Ellsworth. During this outing Wilkins and Ellsworth hammered out plans for a trans-Arctic expedition involving a submarine. Wilkins said the expedition was meant to conduct a \\"comprehensive meteorology study\\" and collect \\"data of academic and economic interest\\". He also anticipated Arctic weather stations and the potential to forecast Arctic weather \\"several years in advance\\". Wilkins believed a submarine could take a fully equipped laboratory into the Arctic. Ellsworth contributed $70,000, plus a $20,000 loan. Newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst purchased exclusive rights to the story for $61,000. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute contributed a further $35,000. Wilkins himself added $25,000 of his own money. Since Wilkins was not a U.S. citizen, he was unable to purchase the 1918 submarine scheduled to be decommissioned, but he was permitted to lease the vessel for a period of five years at a cost of one dollar annually from Lake & Danenhower, Inc. The submarine was the disarmed O-12, and was commanded by Sloan Danenhower (former commanding officer of C-4.Pigboats (retrieved 27 February 2018)) Wilkins renamed her Nautilus, after Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. The submarine was outfitted with a custom-designed drill that would allow her to bore through ice pack overhead for ventilation. The crew of eighteen men was chosen with great care. Among their ranks were U.S. Naval Academy graduates as well as navy veterans of WWI.'' Wilkins described the planned expedition in his 1931 book Under The North Pole, which Wonder Stories praised as \\"[as] exciting as it is epochal\\".\\"Book Reviews\\", Wonder Stories, July 1931, p.287 ==Nautilus expedition== The expedition suffered losses before they even left New York Harbor. Willard Grimmer the quartermaster was knocked overboard and drowned in the harbor. Wilkins was undaunted and drove on with preparations for a series of test cruises and dives before they were to undertake their trans-Arctic voyage. Wilkins and his crew made their way up the Hudson River to Yonkers, eventually reaching New London, Connecticut, where additional modifications and test dives were performed. Satisfied with the performance of both the machinery and the crew, Wilkins and his men left the relative safety of coastal waterways for the uncertainty of the North Atlantic on 4 June 1931. Soon after the commencement of the expedition the starboard engine broke down, and soon after that the port engine followed suit. On 14 June 1931 without a means of propulsion Wilkins was forced to send out an SOS and was rescued later that day by the USS Wyoming. The Nautilus was towed to Ireland on 22 June 1931, and was taken to England for repairs. On 28 June the Nautilus was up and running and on her way to Norway to pick up the scientific contingent of their crew. By 23 August they had left Norway and were only 600 miles from the North Pole. It was at this time that Wilkins uncovered another setback. His submarine was missing its diving planes. Without diving planes he would be unable to control the Nautilus while submerged. Wilkins was determined to do what he could without the diving planes. For the most part Wilkins was thwarted from discovery under the ice floes. The crew was able to take core samples of the ice, as well as testing the salinity of the water and gravity near the pole.Insertlibrary.osu.edu footnote text here Wilkins had to acknowledge when his adventure into the Arctic was becoming too foolhardy when he received a wireless plea from Hearst, which said, \\"I most urgently beg of you to return promptly to safety and to defer any further adventure to a more favorable time, and with a better boat.\\" Wilkins ended the first expedition to the poles in a submarine and headed for England, but was forced to take refuge in the port of Bergen, Norway, because of a fierce storm that they encountered en route. The Nautilus suffered serious damage that made further use of the vessel unfeasible. Wilkins received permission from the United States Navy to sink the vessel off shore in a Norwegian fjord on 20 November 1931. Despite the failure to meet his intended objective, he was able to prove that submarines were capable of operating beneath the polar ice cap, thereby paving the way for future successful missions. ==Later life and career== Wilkins became a student of The Urantia Book and supporter of the Urantia movement after joining the '70' group in Chicago in 1942. After the book's publication in 1955, he 'carried the massive work on his long travels, even to the Antarctic' and told associates that it was his religion.Nasht (2005), p. 278. On 16 March 1958, Wilkins appeared as a guest on the TV panel show What's My Line? ==Death and legacy== Wilkins died in Framingham, Massachusetts, on 30 November 1958. The US Navy later took his ashes to the North Pole aboard the submarine USS Skate on 17 March 1959. The Navy confirmed on 27 March that, \\"In a solemn memorial ceremony conducted by Skate shortly after surfacing, the ashes of Sir Hubert Wilkins were scattered at the North Pole in accordance with his last wishes.\\"\\"Atomic Sub Drills Holes in Polar Ice\\", Oakland Tribune, 17 March 1959, p1 The Wilkins Sound, Wilkins Coast and the Wilkins Ice Shelf in Antarctica are named after him, as are the airport at Jamestown, South Australia, and a road at Adelaide Airport.

Though its members represented a variety of disciplines, from mathematics through logic to psychology, the Lw√≥w‚ÄìWarsaw School is widely considered to have been a philosophical movement.Jan Wole≈Ñski, Filozoficzna szko≈Ça lwowsko-warszawska, Warsaw, PWN, 1985. It has produced some of the leading logicians of the twentieth century such as Jan Lukasiewicz, Stanislaw Lesniewski, and Alfred Tarski, among others. Its members did not only contribute to the techniques of logic but also to various domains that belong to the philosophy of language. ==History== Kazimierz Twardowski Polish philosophy and the Lw√≥w‚ÄìWarsaw school were considerably influenced by Franz Brentano and his pupils Kazimierz Twardowski, Anton Marty, Alexius Meinong, and Edmund Husserl. Twardowski founded the philosophical school when he became the chair of the Lw√≥w University. Principal topics of interest to the Lw√≥w‚ÄìWarsaw school included formal ontology, mereology, and universal or categorial grammar. The Lw√≥w‚ÄìWarsaw School began as a general philosophical school but steadily moved toward logic. The Lw√≥w‚ÄìWarsaw school of logic lay at the origin of Polish logic and was closely associated with or was part of the Warsaw School of Mathematics. According to Jan Wole≈Ñski, a decisive factor in the school's development was the view that the future of the Polish school of mathematics depended on the research connected with the new branches of the field such as set theory and topology, which are closely related to mathematical logic. The \\"philosophical branch\\" followed Twardowski's tradition and produced notable thinkers such as Bronis≈Çaw Bandrowski, who addressed the problem of induction and Tadeusz Kotarbinski, who is known for developing Reism. In the 1930s Alfred Tarski initiated contacts with the Vienna Circle. Tarski, the most prominent member of the Lw√≥w‚ÄìWarsaw School, has been ranked as one of the four greatest logicians of all time, along with Aristotle, Gottlob Frege, and Kurt G√∂del.Feferman & Feferman, p. 1 The school's work was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. Despite this, its members went on to fundamentally influence modern science, notably mathematics and logic, in the post-war period. Tarski's description of semantic truth, for instance, has revolutionized logic and philosophy. In contemporary Polish learning, the philosopher Jan Wole≈Ñski considers himself close to the School's heritage. In 2013 Wole≈Ñski was awarded by the Foundation for Polish Science for his comprehensive analysis of the work of the Lw√≥w‚ÄìWarsaw school and for placing its achievements within the international discourse of contemporary analytic philosophy. ==Members== Warsaw University Library.

It is bordered by New Springville to the south, Bloomfield to the west, Willowbrook to the east, Graniteville to the north, and Westerleigh to the north. The community received its name from an 18th-century tavern located at the intersection of Victory Boulevard and Richmond Avenue (the neighborhood's central point), from which a sign bearing a bull's head was displayed. The Bulls Head area was also known as Phoenixville. During the American Revolution, this tavern became the local headquarters of the faction loyal to the British crown, or Tories, as they were colloquially known. As recently as the early 1960s, Bulls Head and the surrounding neighborhoods, such as Willowbrook to the east and Graniteville to the north, were dominated by farmland. Dramatic change came soon after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened in 1964, opening up the area to residential development. Soon many Jewish families, mostly from the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, settled in Bulls Head and other west mid-island neighborhoods. A smaller number of Asian immigrants live in Bulls Head. Many of the residents are Italian Catholics served by Our Lady of Pity R.C. Church. Bulls Head's schools are the elementary school P.S. 60 and the intermediate school I.S. 72. Most of the residents are zoned for Port Richmond High School. The Todt Hill Library is nearby, at 2550 Victory Boulevard. Bulls Head is served by the local buses and the SIM4, SIM4C, SIM8, SIM8X, SIM32 and SIM33 express buses. As of the 2010 census, the demographics of Bulls Head were roughly 71.2% White, 2.3% Black, 15% Hispanic, 9.8% Asian, and 1.7% Other. This is defining Bulls Head as everything within the boundaries of Census Tracts 291.03, and 291.04, as well as the blocks north of Willowbrook Park in Tract 273.01. ==References== Category:Neighborhoods in Staten Island ","title":"Bulls Head, Staten Island"},{"id":"1426967","text":"The year 1975 in architecture involved some significant architectural events and new buildings. ==Events== * Planned residential development of Noak Bridge in the Borough of Basildon (England), designed by George Garrard and Maurice Naunton, begins. ==Buildings and structures== ===Buildings opened=== Fundaci√≥ Joan Mir√≥ in Barcelona, Spain * June 10 ‚Äì Fundaci√≥ Joan Mir√≥ in Barcelona, designed by Josep Llu√≠s Sert. * June 25 ‚Äì Addleshaw Tower at Chester Cathedral in England, designed by George Pace. * June 28 ‚Äì Sir Thomas White Building, St John's College, Oxford, England, designed by Philip Dowson of Arup Associates. * c.

It was originally designed and built as an interurban trolley tunnel (with a narrow loading gauge and height), with stations near the current Hunters Point Avenue and Grand Central stations. Planning for the tunnel began in 1885, but did not start until 1892 due to a lack of funds. The Steinway Tunnel was named for William Steinway, who provided the funding to start the initial construction. Steinway died in 1896 before the tunnel was completed, and the project sat dormant for several years, before the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) acquired the tunnel. The IRT resumed work in 1905 and completed the tubes in 1907 and was briefly opened for trolley service that September. Due to legal disputes, the tubes closed within a week and did not reopen for another eight years. After the Dual Contracts were signed in 1913, the IRT began converting the tubes to subway use, and the tubes opened as part of the Flushing Line in 1915. In subsequent years, specific rolling stock were ordered to navigate the narrow dimensions of the tubes, and the tunnel suffered from numerous floods and fires. ==Initial work== The East River Tunnel Railroad Company was founded on February 22, 1885, to construct a railroad tunnel crossing the East River. Its objective was to connect the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)'s tracks in Long Island City and the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad's tracks in the City of New York in the same tunnel. At that time period, movement through the New York metropolitan area was hampered by many large bodies of water such as the East River; there were no crossings across these water bodies, except for ferry service, which was not always possible or practical. In addition, plans to build the Blackwell's Island Bridge (later the Queensboro Bridge) were stagnant at the time. The East River Tunnel Railroad Company soon dissolved, and on July 22, 1887, Walter S. Gurnee and Malcolm W. Niven founded the New York and Long Island Railroad Company (NY&LIRR;), which began planning for the tunnel shortly afterward. The tunnel was to begin on the New York side near the Hudson River docks in Manhattan, from there it would go east along 42nd Street to Grand Central and carry straight on under the East River. In Long Island City, the tunnel portals were to be between 5th Street (now 49th Avenue) and 4th Street (now 50th Avenue). It would go under Jackson Avenue and finally Thomson Avenue, intersecting LIRR tracks at Hunterspoint Avenue. The total cost of the tunnel was to be US$11.7 million. The estimated total cost exceeded the financial capabilities of the company by far. In July 1891, piano maker William Steinway, a major landowner in Astoria, Queens, started to fund the tunnel. He became a major shareholder and became the new chairman of the company, so the tunnel was named after him. Steinway advised the company to utilize electricity to power the tunnel, believing that the construction of the tunnel would increase real-estate values within the vicinity. The route was finalized in the City of New York in 1890 and in Long Island City by 1891. Construction was started on June 7, 1892, as a NY&LIRR; project, and the bottom of the tunnel shaft was reached in December of the same year. However, soon after the start of construction, there were many complications. The project was difficult due to complex geological formations beneath the river, and there were frequent blowouts and floods. Construction was curtailed following an accident on December 28, 1892, during an attempt to heat frozen dynamite from an shaft at the corner of Vernon Boulevard, Jackson Avenue and 50th Avenue. An uncontrolled explosion killed five and injured fifty, and heavily damaged numerous surrounding houses. Due to high compensation claims, the company was financially ruined, and attempts to raise additional funds failed because of the stock market crash of 1893. Work was stopped as a result, and it was boarded up. Investors refused to fund the tunnel because they feared that it was unsafe. Attempts to resume construction were occasionally made until Steinway died in 1896. ==The Belmont era== The Steinway Tunnel's Queens portals at left; to the right are the East River Tunnels' portals In 1899, the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), headed by August Belmont Jr., was awarded the contract for construction and operation of the city's subway line and a takeover of Manhattan's elevated railways, thus gaining a monopoly on the city's rapid transit services. In February 1902, the IRT bought the New York & Long Island Railroad and tram operators New York and Queens County Railway for a similar monopoly in Queens. The IRT prepared surveys and plans from scratch. For the proposed tram service under the East River, the plans for the tunnel were modified for dedicated tram operation. The tunnel's trackbed was raised, the gradient increased, and the route shortened. The tunnel was to turn at a loop at the corner of 42nd Street and Park Avenue in Manhattan and go as far as Vernon Boulevard in Queens. There, the tram of the New York and Queens County Railway was to be connected via a ramp. These three underground stations were Lexington Avenue in Manhattan and Jackson Avenue and Van Alst Avenue in Queens. The total cost amounted to $8 million. The city objected to the tunnel project multiple times and after several disasters nearly stopped it. The westernmost of the four shafts for the tunnel was in Manhattan and was numbered #1, while the easternmost shaft, in Queens, was numbered #4. Construction began on July 14, 1905, when shaft #4 was sunk; shaft #2 on the opposite shore was sunk by September 1. Shaft #3 was sunk in the Man-O-War Reef, a granite outcrop in the East River that was expanded and renamed Belmont Island. Four workers were killed in a 1906 shaft accident under Belmont Island. The tunnel was holed through on May 16, 1907, and was completed in September of that year, after 26 months of construction. Buildings for the tunnel's construction had been erected on Belmont Island; these stayed up until at least 1918. Fifty tramcars were made available for operation through the tunnel. They possessed a -long and -wide all-steel superstructure with double-sided semi-open entrances at the ends. Power was drawn from an iron rail on the ceiling, to which the car roof's -high pantograph would attach. The cars were also fitted with rod pantographs for street operation. The first trolley trip in the Steinway Tunnel was scheduled for September 20, 1907, but was postponed due to a power failure. Shortly afterward, trolley cars ran through the tunnel as part of a demonstration run. On September 29, 1907, a short circuit on the overhead wires caused a small fire, and the tunnel was shut down. Belmont did not have a franchise to operate a transit line. The concession to operate the tunnel had expired on January 1, 1907, and the city of New York was unwilling to renew the contract. The city did not tolerate privately operated subways and legally prevented the IRT from operating the tunnel with the trams. For the next five years, the tunnel, with trolley loops on both the Manhattan and Queens sides, remained inoperative. In 1913, Belmont sold the tunnel to the city government after the IRT had signed the Dual Contracts, which included the Steinway Tunnel as part of the new Flushing subway line. ==Subway operation== Vernon Boulevard‚ÄìJackson Avenue station, one of three original subway stations in the Steinway Tunnel Initially, the IRT intended to use the tunnel for trolleys; however, it subsequently decided instead to use the tubes for a heavy-rail rapid transit line. After the IRT measured the tubes, the company found that third rail installation could be possible with small modifications. Regular subway cars could not use the loops and the ramp because of the tight radius of the loops and the steep 6% incline. The roadbed and the rail were determined to be usable for subway service, but even so, the duct banks in the tunnel were replaced. The platforms could be easily extended, and it was also found that the tunnel's width corresponded to the width specifications of the existing IRT subway's car fleet. Work began in 1913, and the tubes were modified to accommodate IRT subway cars in 1914. The work included removing part of the tunnel walls on the Manhattan side and building a cavern to create a track crossover between the tubes. The first IRT Steinway test train between Grand Central and Vernon Avenue (today's Vernon Boulevard‚ÄìJackson Avenue station) ran June 13, 1915, with a regularly scheduled shuttle service beginning June 22. The planned metro route was to go from Times Square through the tunnel over to Long Island City and from there continue towards Flushing. The IRT was to operate this line, with the trackage east of Queensboro Plaza to be shared by the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (later the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation, or BMT). Meanwhile, the construction work continued on the planned route. To the east of the tunnel, the Hunters Point Avenue subway station went up to the level of the Hunterspoint Avenue LIRR station. Immediately east of it was a ramp up to the elevated subway towards Queensboro Plaza. Hunters Point Avenue opened on February 15, 1916, and on November 5 of the same year, it was extended to Queensboro Plaza. Because the line did not have track connections to the rest of the IRT network, a provisional maintenance workshop was operated at the tunnel ramp until 1928. To the west, construction began in 1922. The tunnel was extended to Fifth Avenue on March 23, 1926, and Times Square on March 14, 1927. When Belmont modified the IRT Flushing Line to extend to Times Square and to Flushing, it was found that the loops could not be used for the extensions. The loops on the Queens side of the tunnel were obliterated in the wake of new construction. The loop on the Manhattan side, however, is intact and occupied by maintenance rooms, although the ceiling third rail still exists in the loop. The line from Times Square to Flushing was completed in 1928, when the station at Flushing opened. Since the tunnel ramps towards Queens were significantly steeper than normal IRT specifications, with a gradient of 4%, special rolling stock had to be procured for the Steinway Tunnel line. The \\"Steinway\\"-type subway car had the same dimensions as an ordinary subway cars of the IRT, but included modified gear boxes. Initially, twelve single-car consists were approved for the original shuttle. Because of additional construction to the route, another 126 cars were added to the fleet. The 50 \\"World's Fair\\"-type cars, used for the 1939 New York World's Fair, used the same type of gear boxes. With the 1948 introduction of four- motor subway cars of types R12 and R14, the need for a special drive was gone, as the Steinway Tunnel could now be driven by conventional railcars. In 1949, BMT services stopped operating on the Flushing Line east of Queensboro Plaza, and the IRT was assigned exclusive operation of the line. In subsequent years, the tubes of the Steinway Tunnel were difficult to maintain: they were prone to flooding, and the tube walls were much narrower than other tunnels in the subway system, with almost no clearance on each side of the train. After a train got stuck in the tunnel in 1971, a passenger died of a heart attack. A fire broke out on a train in the tunnel in 1973, killing one passenger and trapping over a thousand in the middle of the tunnel, after the collapse of an archway. In 1991, the tubes were flooded to after a water main broke on the Manhattan side. The next year, an electrical fire in the tunnel melted several feet of iron track, although the tunnel's exhaust fans were working properly. After Hurricane Sandy-related storm surges flooded the tunnel in 2012, the tubes were rebuilt in a $29 million project that took place between 2013 and April 2016. To protect the tunnel from future flooding, two retaining walls will be installed on either side of the tunnel portal in Queens, and flex gates would be installed to prevent water from entering the tunnel. The project is estimated to cost $15 million, and work will begin in May 2021. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ==Further reading== * IRT Corona/Flushing Line from nycsubway.org. * * * Category:Belmont family Category:Crossings of the East River Category:Long Island City Category:Midtown Manhattan Category:New York City Subway infrastructure Category:Railroad tunnels in New York City Category:Tunnels completed in 1915 Category:Tunnels in Manhattan Category:1915 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Steinway Tunnel"},{"id":"1426985","text":"The Drepanidae is a family of moths with about 660 species described worldwide.

Headquartered in Kabul, Afghan Wireless provides 4G LTE and other services, such as internet and mobile payments to about five million subscribers across Afghanistan's 34 provinces.\\"Tuition\\" AWCC The company has partnerships with 425 carrier networks in 125 countries. Founded in 2002 by Ehsan Bayat, Afghan Wireless is a joint venture of Telephone Systems International and the Afghan Ministry of Communications.NZ Herald ==History== ===Founding and licensing=== In 1998, Afghan-American telecommunications entrepreneur Ehsan Bayat won an exclusive license from Afghanistan's Taliban government to create a joint venture with the country's Ministry of Communications, which was given 20% ownership.Globe and Mail The deal had been negotiated by investors from the United States, Britain, and Sweden.The New York Times Afghan Wireless Communications Company, or AWCC, was established as a subsidiary of Telephone Systems International, and financial backing was provided by the British entrepreneurs Stuart Bentham and Lord Michael Cecil.Taipei Times In June 1999 the Taliban granted Afghan Wireless a 15-year monopoly on cell phone traffic in Afghanistan, and within the year Afghan Wireless had re-enabled Afghanistan's international country calling code. In 1999 and 2000 the company set up digital telephone exchanges in the cities of Kabul and Kandahar, replacing the outdated manual telephone switchboards that the country's telecommunications had long relied upon. Although the Taliban were overthrown by an American invasion in 2001, Afghan Wireless was nevertheless the first company licensed to provide GSM wireless service in Afghanistan. With the lifting of the trade embargo, Afghan Wireless brought in technology from American vendors including WorldCom, TECORE Wireless Systems, and AirNet Communications Corporation. Afghan interim leader Hamid Karzai publicly made the first phone call on April 6, 2002, calling and speaking with the Afghan ambassador to the United Nations in New York City. As the network went public using a pre-paid platform, phone booths were set up for those unable to afford cellphones. In June 2002, Argent Networks in New Zealand was contracted to help Afghan Wireless develop its GSM mobile network. The following year Argent also developed a billing system for the network, and competing companies such as Roshan started to appear. ===Growth and owner lawsuits=== In 2002 Bayat allegedly attempted to buy out Cecil and Bentham, but the offers were disregarded as \\"derisory.\\" Bayat and Afghan Wireless subsequently sued Cecil and Bentham for allegedly misappropriating money from the company. Cecil, Bentham, and two other founding investors counter-sued, claiming they had not received over ¬£250 million in due shares and alleging \\"fraud, deceit, breach of contract and conspiracy.\\" The case was dismissed from American courts and ultimately hidden from public records and dismissed in Bayat's favor in British courts in August 2011. Starting around 2006, Afghan Wireless was one of five companies with towers damaged and destroyed by the Taliban, with the Taliban demanding that telecommunications companies in the country limit service.Telegraph The attacks were reported stopped by 2009, with The Globe and Mail explaining that \\"public discontent with service disruptions overwhelmed religious or tribal affiliations.\\" By June 2008, Afghan Wireless reported to have 2 million subscribers across all 34 of Afghanistan's provinces. The company had around 5 million users by 2009. In 2011 Afghan Wireless remained partially owned by the Afghan Ministry of Communications, which maintains a 10-20% stake.Kabul Press ===Allegations of American intelligence links=== In a 2011 report by Vanity Fair contributing editor David Rose, it was alleged that Afghan Wireless was linked to an American intelligence project called Operation Foxden, a Federal Bureau of Investigation and National Security Agency endeavor to wiretap Afghan Wireless' infrastructure for intelligence gathering on the Taliban regime. Although allegedly authorized to proceed on September 8, 2001, Operation Foxden was rendered moot by the September 11 attacks and invasion of Afghanistan. Rose claimed that in the operation's planning stages, the FBI and NSA helped transfer ownership of Afghan Wireless to a shell company, Netmobile, in Liechtenstein, to circumnavigate the 1999 Executive Order 13129 ban on American citizens doing business with the Taliban. In response to the article, Bayat denied that American intelligence agencies were behind the change in ownership, and that \\"to the contrary, my application for an exemption from U.S. sanctions was denied by the U.S. government.\\" Bayat also denied that he or his companies had acted unlawfully, installed wiretaps, or acted as \\"an agent, informant or spy.\\" ==2010s== Afghan Wireless launched a mobile-money feature in 2012 involving biometrics.Biometric update In 2017, the Afghanistan Ministry of Finance gave Afghan Wireless a \\"Best Large Taxpayer\\" award. Afghan Wireless announced that it had launched the first 4G LTE service in Afghanistan in May 2017, claiming position as the country's largest private employer, with 8,000 employees. That year, the company also partnered with 425 wireless networks spread throughout 125 countries, with five million clients and coverage in all of Afghanistan's 34 provinces. In February 2018, Afghan Wireless announced that its mobile payment service could be used on electricity bills.AWCC The following month, the company signed a new license agreement with the Afghanistan Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (ATRA) for installation and operation of a fiber optic network., \\"Fiber Optics\\"AWCC By April 2018, Afghan Wireless remained the only mobile communications company in the country providing 4G LTE HD and, that month, increased pay assistance to its employees attending Kardan University and Rana University. In August 2018, AWCC launched Khazana, an SMS-based news and media subscription service. In October 2018, Afghan Wireless launched 4.75G+ service in Kandahar City, upgrading subscribers from 4G to its higher-speed service. As of December 2018, the AWCC My Money app was noted as the largest mobile payment service in Afghanistan. In January 2019, in cooperation with World Bank Group member, the International Finance Corporation (IFC)'s Lighting Afghanistan program; AWCC launched its pay-as-you-go (PAYG) electrical service, reported to be Afghanistan's first off-grid solar powered electrical service.\\"AWCC LAUNCHES PAYGO‚ÄîAFGHANISTAN‚ÄôS FIRST-EVER OFF-GRID SOLAR POWERED ELECTRICAL LIGHTING AND POWER SERVICE\\"; Afghan Wireless January 20, 2019.Asia launches PAYGO in Afghanistan\\"; Lighting Global.org; January 20, 2019. ===FIFA sponsorship=== AWCC was a sponsor of the 2018 FIFA World Cup held in Russia, which was then broadcast in Afghanistan for the first time by the Ariana Television Network. ==See also== *List of companies of Afghanistan *Communications in Afghanistan *List of telephone operating companies == References == ==External links== *Official website Category:Telecommunications companies of Afghanistan Category:Joint ventures Category:Mobile phone companies of Afghanistan ","title":"Afghan Wireless"},{"id":"1427023","text":"The Province of Canterbury, or less formally the Southern Province, is one of two ecclesiastical provinces which constitute the Church of England. The other is the Province of York (which consists of 12 dioceses). It consists of 30 dioceses, covering roughly two-thirds of England, parts of Wales, and the Channel Islands, with the remainder comprising continental Europe (under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe). Between the years 787 and 803, a third province, (of) Lichfield, existed. In 1871, the Church of Ireland became autonomous. The Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920 and therefore was no longer the state church; it consists of six dioceses and is an ecclesiastical province of the Anglican Communion. The province's metropolitan bishop is the Archbishop of Canterbury who also oversees the Falkland Islands, an extraprovincial parish.Islands (Extra-Provincial to Canterbury) The Church of Ceylon - Anglican Church in Sri Lanka has two dioceses - the Diocese of Colombo and the Diocese of Kurunegala which are extraprovincial dioceses under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Canterbury. ==Provincial chapter== Bishops of the southern province meet in chapter, in which the episcopal roles (those of Bishops) are analogous to those within a Cathedral chapter. In the 19th century, Edward White Benson, Archbishop of Canterbury, discussed with the Bishop of Winchester and others the role of the Bishop of Winchester within the Chapter. Lambeth Palace librarian Samuel Kershaw uncovered documents in which the Bishop of Winchester was Sub-Dean and the Bishop of Lincoln Chancellor, and others in which Winchester was Chancellor and Lincoln Vice-Chancellor. Benson ruled that the Bishop of Winchester would be Chancellor of the province and additionally Sub- Dean only during a vacancy in the see of London (Dean of the province).Benson, Edward White.

The monkey, apparently named Jizzle as a mis-pronunciation of Giselle, has the ability to draw portraits of anyone placed in front of her, and her new owner exploits this talent in the circus. Jealousy builds up between the monkey and the man's wife, culminating when the man finds a picture Jizzle has drawn of his wife apparently sleeping with his friend. After his wife leaves, as a result of the picture, the man begins to tire of Jizzle and mistreats her, eventually giving her away to another worker at the circus. A few days later the new owner appears with Jizzle and a picture she has drawn of the new owner's wife and the old owner in bed together. As the new owner exacts his revenge, Jizzle smirks. Alfred Hitchcock Presents filmed this story, retitling it Maria. ;Technical Slip: deals with the aftermath of a bureaucratic error by a demonic trader.

York was elevated to an archbishopric in AD 735: Ecgbert was the first archbishop. At one time the archbishops of York also claimed metropolitan authority over Scotland but these claims were never realised and ceased when the Archdiocese of St Andrews was established. The province's metropolitan bishop is the archbishop of York (the junior of the Church of England's two archbishops). York Minster serves as the mother church of the Province of York. ==Boundary changes since the mid-19th century== In 1836 the diocese of Ripon was formed (Ripon and Leeds from 1999), followed by further foundations: Manchester in 1847, Liverpool in 1880, Newcastle in 1882, Wakefield in 1888, Sheffield in 1914, Bradford in 1919, and Blackburn in 1926. The diocese of Southwell was a special case: in 1837 the archdeaconry of Nottingham, which until then had formed part of the diocese of York, was transferred to the diocese of Lincoln and hence to the province of Canterbury. In 1884 the counties of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire were merged to form the new diocese of Southwell. The diocese of Derby was created in 1927, removing Derbyshire from Southwell's jurisdiction, and in 1935 the diocese of Southwell was transferred back to the province of York. ==References== Category:Church of England ecclesiastical polity Category:Ecclesiastical provinces of the Anglican Communion in Europe Category:Northern England ","title":"Province of York"},{"id":"1427054","text":"The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is an agency of the European Union (EU) in charge of the evaluation and supervision of medicinal products. Prior to 2004, it was known as the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products or European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA).Set up by EC Regulation No. 2309/93 as the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, and renamed by EC Regulation No. 726/2004 to the European Medicines Agency, it had the acronym EMEA until December 2009. The European Medicines Agency does not call itself EMA either ‚Äì it has no official acronym but may reconsider if EMA becomes commonly accepted (see communication on new visual identity and logo ). The EMA was set up in 1995, with funding from the European Union and the pharmaceutical industry, as well as indirect subsidy from member states, its stated intention to harmonise (but not replace) the work of existing national medicine regulatory bodies. The hope was that this plan would not only reduce the ‚Ç¨350 million annual cost drug companies incurred by having to win separate approvals from each member state but also that it would eliminate the protectionist tendencies of sovereign states unwilling to approve new drugs that might compete with those already produced by domestic drug companies. The EMA was founded after more than seven years of negotiations among EU governments and replaced the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products and the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products, though both of these were reborn as the core scientific advisory committees. The agency was located in London prior to the United Kingdom's vote for withdrawal from the European Union, relocating to Amsterdam in March 2019. ==Operations== The EMA operates as a decentralised scientific agency (as opposed to a regulatory authority) of the European Union and its main responsibility is the protection and promotion of public and animal health, through the evaluation and supervision of medicines for human and veterinary use. More specifically, it coordinates the evaluation and monitoring of centrally authorised products and national referrals, develops technical guidance and provides scientific advice to sponsors. Its scope of operations is medicinal products for human and veterinary use including biologics and advanced therapies, and herbal medicinal products. The agency is composed of the Secretariat (ca. 600 staff), a management board, seven scientific committees (human, veterinary and herbal medicinal products, orphan drugs, paediatrics, advanced therapies and pharmacovigilance risk assessment) and a number of scientific working parties. The Secretariat is organised into five units: Directorate, Human Medicines Development and Evaluation, Patient Health Protection, Veterinary Medicines and Product Data Management, Information and Communications Technology and Administration. The Management Board provides administrative oversight to the Agency: including approval of budgets and plans, and selection of Executive Director. The Board includes one representative of each of the 28 Member States, two representatives of the European Commission, two representatives of the European Parliament, two representatives of patients' organisations, one representative of doctors' organisations and one representative of veterinarians' organisations. The Agency decentralises its scientific assessment of medicines by working through a network of about 4500 experts throughout the EU. The EMA draws on resources of over 40 National Competent Authorities (NCAs) of EU Member states. ==Centralised marketing authorisations== The centralised procedure allows companies to submit a single application to the agency to obtain from the European Commission a centralised (or 'Community') marketing authorisation (MA) valid in all EU and European Economic Area (EEA)-European Free Trade Association (EFTA) states (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralised procedure is compulsory for all medicines derived from biotechnology and other high-tech processes, as well as for human medicines for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases, and for veterinary medicines for use for growth or yield enhancers. It is also compulsory for advanced-therapy medicines such as gene- therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and for Orphan medicines (medicines for rare diseases). The centralised procedure is also open to products that bring a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or is in any other respect in the interest of patient or animal health. As a result, the majority of genuinely novel medicines are authorised through the EMA. For products eligible for or requiring centralised approval, a company submits an application for a marketing authorisation to the EMA. ==Committees== ===Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use=== A single evaluation is carried out through the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). If the Committee concludes that the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product is sufficiently proven, it adopts a positive opinion. This is sent to the European Commission to be transformed into a marketing authorisation valid for the whole of the EU. A special type of approval is the paediatric-use marketing authorisation (PUMA), which can be granted for medical products intended exclusively for paediatric use. The CHMP is obliged by the regulation to reach decisions within 210 days, though the clock is stopped if it is necessary to ask the applicant for clarification or further supporting data. ===Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use=== The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) operates in analogy to the CHMP as described above. ===Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products=== The Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) administers the granting of orphan drug status since 2000. Companies intending to develop medicinal products for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life- threatening or very serious conditions that affect not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union can apply for 'orphan medicinal product designation'. The COMP evaluates the application and makes a recommendation for the designation which is then granted by the European Commission. ===Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products=== The Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC) assists the harmonisation of procedures and provisions concerning herbal medicinal products laid down in EU Member States, and further integrating herbal medicinal products in the European regulatory framework since 2004. ===Paediatric Committee=== The Paediatric Committee (PDCO) deals with the implementation of the paediatric legislation in Europe Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 since 2007. Under this legislation, all applications for marketing authorisation of new medicinal products, or variations to existing authorisations, have to either include data from paediatric studies previously agreed with the PDCO, or obtain a PDCO waiver or a deferral of these studies. ===Committee for Advanced Therapies=== The Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) was established in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 on advanced-therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products. It assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of ATMPs, and follows scientific developments in the field. ===Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee=== A seventh committee, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) has come into function in 2012 with the implementation of the new EU pharmacovigilance legislation (Directive 2010/84/EU). ==Other activities== The Agency carries out a number of activities, including: *Pharmacovigilance: The Agency constantly monitors the safety of medicines through a pharmacovigilance network and EudraVigilance, so that it can take appropriate actions if adverse drug reaction reports suggest that the benefit-risk balance of a medicine has changed since it was authorised. *Referrals: The Agency coordinates arbitration procedures relating to medicinal products that are approved or under consideration by Member States in non-centralized authorisation procedures. *Scientific Advice: Companies wishing to receive scientific advice from the CHMP or CVMP on the appropriate tests and studies to carry out in the development of a medicinal products can request it prior to or during the development program. *Telematics projects: The Agency is responsible for implementing a central set of pan-European systems and databases such as EudraVigilance, EudraCT and EudraPharm. ==Relocation== Following the 2016 decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union (\\"Brexit\\"), the EMA chose to search for another base of operations. According to EU Law the European Commission had to decide on the fate of the EMA's location. The EU ministers met to vote on their preferred successor. The EU's Health Commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis said that the preferred choice would be a location where an \\"easy set up and guarantee of smooth operations\\" would be available. Member states who had expressed their bid for the new EMA location were Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden. It had also been speculated that the Strasbourg-based seat for the European Parliament could be moved to Brussels, in exchange for the city to host the EMA. Others speculated on the merits of Amsterdam, well before the final decision was made. The decision on the relocation was made on 20 November 2017, during the EU General Affairs Council meeting, after three voting rounds and finally drawing of lots. After the first round of voting, Milan (25 votes), Amsterdam (20 votes) and Copenhagen (20 votes) were the only contenders left. After the second voting round, two cities were left: Milan (twelve votes) and Amsterdam (nine votes). These two cities tied in the subsequent vote (thirteen votes each), after which a drawing of lots identified Amsterdam as the host city of EMA. It is unclear what future arrangements the United Kingdom proposes to make for its own medicinal evaluation after leaving the EU. Paul Workman, the president of the London- based Institute of Cancer Research, has suggested that pharmaceutical companies would naturally seek regulatory approval for new drugs in the biggest markets first, leaving the UK facing delays in approval if they set up independent arrangements. ==Criticism of the EMA process== The review process of the European Medicines Agency regarding medical issues has been criticized for its lack of transparency and issues of conflict of interest. In a rebuttal of an EMS review that included her work, Louise Brinth, a Danish physician, noted that \\"experts\\" reviewing data remain unnamed and seem to be bound to secrecy. Minutes are not released and diverging opinions are not reported suggesting that all the \\"experts\\" are of the same opinion. In her view the process is unscientific and undemocratic.Louise Brinth: Responsum to Assessment Report on HPV-vaccines released by EMA November 26th 2015., online (PDF; 1,3 MB) ==Comparison with other regulatory agencies== The EMA is roughly parallel to the drug part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but without centralisation. The timetable for product approval via the EMA's centralised procedure of 210 days compares well with the average of 500 days taken by the FDA to evaluate a product. == See also == * Ethics Committee * EudraCT * EudraGMP * EudraLex * EUDRANET * EudraPharm * EudraVigilance * European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership * European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network * European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations * European Forum for Good Clinical Practice (EFGCP) * ICH * Inverse benefit law * Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA, UK) * Qualified person * Regulation of therapeutic goods * Supplementary protection certificate (SPC) * European Banking Authority ==References== == Further reading == * ==External links== * * EMA Annual Report 2018 * Heads of Medicines Agencies * The Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union (EudraLex) * Health-EU Portal official public health portal of the European Union Category:1993 in the European Union Category:Agencies of the European Union Category:European medical and health organizations Category:Government agencies established in 1993 Category:International organisations based in the Netherlands Category:Medical and health organisations based in the Netherlands Category:National agencies for drug regulation Category:Organisations based in Amsterdam Category:Regulators of biotechnology products Category:Regulation in the European Union ","title":"European Medicines Agency"},{"id":"1427060","text":"Leicester South by-election may refer to: *2004 Leicester South by-election *2011 Leicester South by-election ","title":"Leicester South by-election"},{"id":"1427065","text":"The Linguistic Society of Hong Kong (LSHK) is a non-profit academic association, which was formally registered as a charitable organization in Hong Kong on 8 March 1986.

He graduated cum laude from Wesleyan University in 1858, and earned a law degree from Albany Law School in 1859. Following graduation, he moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin to establish the law firm of Palmer, Hooker, and Pitkin. In 1872, he resigned from the firm due to illness, and set sail for Europe in search of a cure. Returning to the United States in 1874, he settled in southwestern Colorado, where his health stabilized, and resumed his career as an attorney. In addition, he invested in the mining industry. Utilizing his contacts in the mining industry, he announced his candidacy for Governor of Colorado in 1878, and won. During his two terms as governor, he dealt with a number of crises including the railway feud involving the Atchison, Topeka- Santa Fe, and the Denver-Rio Grande rail companies.

The park is located inside a large traffic circle in the shape of an ellipse and bounded by the Elliptical Road and is the main park of Quezon City (which served as the official capital of the Philippines from 1948 to 1976). Its main feature is a tall mausoleum containing the remains of Manuel L. Quezon, the second official President of the Philippines and the first of an internationally recognized independent Philippines, and his wife, First Lady Aurora Quezon. This location will be the street alignment for the approved Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 7 named Quezon Memorial MRT Station and the station will be underground. \\"Circle\\", as locals call it, has been undergoing significant changes in order to lure in more tourists both local and foreign. Due to these beautification efforts of the local government the number of visitors is continuously increasing.Quick Tour in Quezon City Memorial Circle ==History== the City Hall. The site was originally intended as the grounds of the National Capitol to be built in Quezon City to house the Congress of the Philippines. The location was also part of a larger National Government Center located around Elliptical Road and the Quezon City Quadrangle (made up of the North, South, East, and West Triangles). The NGC was meant to house the three branches of the Philippine government (legislative, executive, and judicial). While the cornerstone for the structure was laid on November 15, 1940, only the foundations were in place when construction was interrupted by the beginning of the Second World War in the Philippines.Manila Bulletin - War aborts Capitol Building; 61st Anniversary of Quezon City.(Opinion/Editorial) by Isabelo T. Crisostomo After World War II in December 1945, President Sergio Osme√±a issued Executive Order No. 79 stipulating the creation of a Quezon Memorial Committee to raise funds by public subscription to erect a memorial to his predecessor, President Manuel L. Quezon. Former Quezon City Mayor Tomas Morato was instrumental to the selection of the site of the memorial park. Then President Elpidio Quirino proposed the relocation of the monument but this was opposed by Morato who resigned from his post as congressman representing Quezon province in 1949 due to disputes over the plan of then President Quirino. A national contest for the Quezon Memorial Project was held 1951. Filipino architect Federico S. Ilustre's design won the contest. Aside from the monument itself, a complex of three buildings, including a presidential library, a museum, & a theater, were also planned to be erected. In the 1970s the undeveloped grounds of the memorial circle was used for the mass celebrated by Pope Paul VI. Shortly after the People Power Revolution in 1986, the Quezon City Parks Development Foundation (QCPDF) was established during the term of then Quezon City Mayor, Brigido Simon Jr. Under a tripartite agreement between the Quezon City government, National Historical Institute (NHI, now the National Historical Commission of the Philippines) and the National Parks Development Administration (NPDA), the NPDA was given jurisdiction over the park except a one hectare area covering the Quezon Memorial Shrine which is under the NHI. The NPDA turned over the management of the park to the QCPDF and the city government gave the foundation authority to raise revenue for the maintenance of the park. In the 1980s, the architecture firm of Francisco Ma√±osa made a masterplan for the park sometime in the 1980s. On July 1, 2008, the QCPDF which has been managing the park from September 27, 1988, transferred management duties to the Quezon City government. During the COVID-19 pandemic the park was the site of makeshift dormitories for health workers employed in nearby hospitals and a testing site. ==Park lay-out== ===Quezon Memorial Shrine=== View of the Quezon Memorial Shrine. The Quezon Memorial Shrine is an art deco-themed monument was designed by Federico Ilustre and was built during the 1950s and serves as the centerpiece of the Quezon Memorial Circle. The shrine representing Quezon's age when he died from tuberculosis stands on a thirty-six hectare elliptical lot. It houses an observation deck that can accommodate sixty people at the top through a spiral staircase which gives the visitors a panoramic view of the city. Manuel Quezon and his wife Aurora located at Quezon Memorial Circle, Quezon City At the top of the pylons are three mourning angels holding sampaguita (the national flower) wreaths sculpted by the Italian sculptor Francesco Monti. The regional identity of each female angels figure could be discerned in the traditional costume they were clothed with. The winged figures atop the three pylons represented Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The three pylons would in turn circumscribe a drum-like two-story structure containing a gallery from which visitors could look down at Quezon's catafalque, modeled after Napoleon Bonaparte's in the Invalides. The gallery and the catafalque below are lit by an oculus, in turn reminiscent of Grant's Tomb. ===Museums=== Display at the Museo ni Manuel L. Quezon in 2012 The planned auxiliary structures (presidential library, museum, and theater) were never built. Two smaller museums, one containing the presidential memorabilia of Quezon, and the other containing items on the history of Quezon City, were installed within the Shrine itself. In the 1980s, missing, lost, or incomplete bas reliefs for the outside of the memorial were installed. A house of Manuel L. Quezon family in Gilmore, New Manila was transferred within the Quezon Memorial Circle and was made a museum. A city museum, the Quezon City Experience (QCX) was also opened within park grounds in late 2015. The Presidential Car Museum, housing the presidential cars of former Philippine presidents, was inaugurated on August 19, 2018. ===Recreation spaces=== Quezon City Circle also hosts the Circle of Fun, a small amusement park which has various rides such as the \\"Fun Drop\\" a drop tower ride and the \\"Sea Dragon\\", a pirate ship type of amusement ride. A separate attraction, the Pedal N Paddle offers go-kart rides, boat rides in a small pond, fish spa, a 4D theater and Skybike, where patrons ride modified bicycles attached on an elevated rail. A children's playground and a rental bicycles are also available which can be used on a bicycle track within the park. Dining outlets and a flea market are also situated within park grounds. Previously the park had a disco area near the Quezon Memorial Shrine but it has been closed down. Public facilities for events such as the Seminar Hall, Century Hall, People‚Äôs Hall, and a stage, as well as covered courts were introduced by the city government which took over administration of the park in 2008. A dancing fountain was also renovated by the city government which is illuminated with colors at night. ===Gardens, monuments, and markers=== Hardin ng Mga Bulaklak gate. World Peace Bell Manuel Quezon at Quezon Memorial Circle The elliptical park features smaller gardens and named green spaces within its grounds such as the Hardin ng Mga Bulaklak () and the Tropical Garden. The Quezon Memorial Circle also host a demo urban farm which in 2015 is occupying a . The urban farm inside the park is one of the several sites under the \\"Joy of Urban Farming\\" project of Vice Mayor, Joy Belmonte which was launched in 2010. In 2011, the Cactus and Succulent Garden designed by Serapion Metilla was opened to the public. Among the other areas of the park is the World Peace Bell. The bell installed not before 1994, was a donation of the World Peace Bell Association, a Japanese organization promoting awareness on the world peace movement. The Philippines was the first Southeast Asian nation to receive a bell from the association. The first bell was made from coins donated by the then 65 member countries of the United Nations, weighs , has a height of , and a diameter of . It was designed by the Quezon City Planning Office. The bell was turned over to then Quezon City Vice Mayor, Charito Planas by World Peace Bell Association Executive Chairman Tomojiro Yoshida at the Tsunamachi Mitsui Club in Tokyo on July 1, 1994. The bell was inaugurated by then President Fidel V. Ramos on December 10, 1994 who formally presented the bell to then Quezon City Mayor Ismael Mathay. A Peace Monument was also erected inside the grounds of the park by the Rotary Club. It marked Quezon City as a Rotary Peace City as part of the \\"Community Peace Cities/Towns\\" concept conceived by the Rotary Club of Wagga Wagga, Australia. Quezon City is the fifth Rotary Peace Community in the Philippines and 25th in the world. The peace monument was inaugurated on December 7, 1999. The Philippine‚ÄìIsrael Friendship Park is hosted within the larger Quezon Memorial Circle beside the Quezon Heritage House. The park had its groundbreaking in December 2017 and was inaugurated in August 2018. It commemorate President Manuel L. Quezon's efforts to accept 1,000 Jewish refugees in the Philippines during the World War II era and the Philippines' support for the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the establishment of the State of Israel. ===Transportation=== The Quezon Memorial Circle is totally engulfed by the Elliptical Road. A pedestrian underpass was opened in October 2007 which connects the lot occupied by the Quezon City Hall and the park. A second underpass connects the park to the Philcoa area near the Commonwealth Avenue amounted to and opened in December 2009. The park will also host an eponymous station of the Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 7 (MRT-7), which is under construction. ==Vendors and stalls== As of 2017, the Quezon Memorial Circle hosts five restaurants and 13 food stalls. There are also 19 kiosks, 39 plant stalls, as well as 21 stalls from Agri-Aqua Network International. 7 other establishments also has presence in the park including the TEC bike rental, Pedal n Paddle Inc., and Philippine Mango Seedling. Following a planned redevelopment of the park by Mayor Joy Belmonte some stall vendors and restaurants surrounding the park's children's playground vacated the park after their permit expired on June 30, 2019. Within the same year, Belmonte launched the Fresh Market, a weekly farmer-to-consumer program, that would allow farmers from nearby provinces to sell produce to residents within the park. ==Visitors== In 2012, it was reported that an average of 8,000 people visit the Quezon Memorial Circle daily. The average figures during the weekends were reportedly higher during the weekends amounting to 12,000 people. In December 2011, more than a million visited the park. ==See also== *List of parks in Manila *Manuel L.

He was the first Governor of Bihar and Orissa, first Indian Advocate-General of Bengal, first Indian to become a member of the Viceroy's executive Council and the first Indian to become a member of the British ministry. He is sometimes also referred as Satyendra Prasanno Sinha or Satyendra Prasad Sinha. ==Early life and education== Sinha was born on 24 March 1863 in Raipur, Birbhum in Bengal Presidency, British India (now in West Bengal, India). His ancestor, Lalchand Dey, a businessman, came from Midnapur in southern Bengal to Birbhum in south- western Bengal, sailing up the Ajoy, to Raipur, which is just south of Bolpur. Here he set up his new home, buying the zamindari of Raipur from the Chaudhuri of the village.

His legal practice in 1908 was so lucrative that accepting government's invitation meant a cut in his annual income of ¬£10,000. Sinha's first inclination was to turn down the viceroy's invitation, but Jinnah and Gokhale convinced him to accept the job. He also became the first Indian to enter the Viceroy's Executive Council in 1909. He was knighted in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1915.

Eaton was a founding officer of the Greeley Colony and was instrumental in the establishment of modern irrigation farming to Northern Colorado. A member of the Republican Party, he served as the fourth Governor of Colorado, from January 1885 to January 1887, with the nickname of the \\"farmer governor\\". He was one of the largest land owners in Weld and Larimer counties, at one time owning over ninety 160 acre (0.6 km¬≤) parcels, all watered from canals and reservoirs of his own construction. His projects were influential in helping turn the South Platte River valley into an important agricultural region in the state's economy. The town of Eaton, Colorado in western Weld County is named for him. Benjamin Harrison Eaton's sister, Mary Jane Eaton, married William S. Dickerson, also from Coshocton County, Ohio. They settled in Weld County, Colorado. Their daughter Adda Dickerson married Thomas Grant Cullison in Windsor Colorado on September 20, 1900. Thomas & Adda's grandson Tom Cullison, deceased, recently lived in the Greeley/Eaton Colorado area. Eaton is among Colorado's sixteen notable pioneers who are depicted in stained glass on the rotunda of the Colorado State Capitol Building. ==Early life== Eaton was born in Coshocton, Ohio, the second of eight children born to Hannah (n√©e Smith) and Levi Eaton. His maternal grandmother was Mary (n√©e Yarnall) Smith, whose great grandfather, Francis Yarnall, emigrated to the Penn Colony in 1683. Eaton went to school in West Bedford, Ohio and taught school there as well. In 1854, at the age of 21, he moved to Louisa County, Iowa, where he taught school for two years. He returned to Ohio in 1856 where he married Delilah Wolf. His wife died in 1857 after giving birth to a son, Aaron James Eaton. After emigrating to Colorado in 1858 during the Colorado Gold Rush he settled in Weld County In 1858 Eaton went to Iowa for the second time. The following year 1859, at the height of the Colorado Gold Rush, he went from Iowa to Colorado. He prospected for gold in Colorado and New Mexico, as well as working on farms. During the American Civil War, he served under Colonel Kit Carson, in the New Mexico Volunteers. In 1863, he built a farm on the present location of Windsor, Colorado. (Mike Peters, Greeley Tribune, \\"How Weld Towns Got Their Name\\"). He returned to Louisa County, Iowa in 1864 and married Rebecca J. Hill, his second wife. Together they crossed the Great Plains with his second wife that year and settled in Weld County along its western border with Larimer County, establishing a livestock raising operation. He was an early prominent citizen of Fort Collins, the nearest post office and trading point, and was a charter member of the Masonic Lodge there. In 1866, he was elected as Justice of the Peace, serving in that capacity for nine years. For six years, he served concurrently as a county commissioner. Eaton and Rebecca Hill had three children: Lincoln Eaton, Bruce Grant Eaton, and Jennie Bell Eaton. ==Later career== In 1870 Eaton met Nathan Meeker, whom newspaperman Horace Greeley had dispatched to Colorado to pick the Union Colony site. Eaton suggested the land southeast of his place, at the confluence of the South Platte and Poudre Rivers. Eaton promised to assist the ditch construction that would be critical to the colony's farms. Bankrolled by Horace Greeley, the Union Colonists secured 60,000 contiguous acres. On March 15, 1870, the executive committee named the town \\"Greeley.\\" Gophers continually thwarted the 35-mile Canal No. 1 but, according to Union Colony minutes, Eaton would not give up. Eaton expanded his operations from farming into contracting, specializing in the building of irrigation canals and reservoirs, a business he heavily promoted as a means of bringing growth and wealth to Larimer and Weld Counties. In 1873, in association with John C. Abbott, he built what later became known as Larimer County Canal No. 2, which watered large areas of land west, south, and southwest of Fort Collins. Competition for water between Fort Collins Agricultural Colony and the Greeley became desperate and in 1874 almost led to gunfire. Ben Eaton and a few others calmed Greeley colonists with a commitment to divide the water according to need and a promise to deliver it. The promise was not necessary because it rained. In 1878 he began construction of the Larimer and Weld Canal, once known as the Eaton Ditch. The Larimer and Weld Irrigation Company was incorporated on March 10, 1879. The company's board of directors were James Duff, Hyde Sparkes, Benjamin H. Eaton, Thomas B. Dunbar, and Aaron J. Eaton. The capital stock, $200,000, was divided into two thousand shares at $100 each. This was the largest and longest irrigation canal in the state, irrigating 50,000 acres. In 1879 he built the High Line Canal in Denver for a group of British investors. He later built the Windsor Reservoir near present-day Windsor, as well as many other smaller water projects throughout Larimer and Weld counties. He died in 1904 at Greeley. ==See also== History of Larimer County, Colorado, Ansel Watrous (1911). ==References== ==External links== *Colorado State Archives-Benjamin Harrison Eaton Collection Category:1833 births Category:1904 deaths Category:Governors of Colorado Category:Colorado Republicans Category:People from Coshocton, Ohio Category:People from Windsor, Colorado Category:Politicians from Fort Collins, Colorado Category:Republican Party state governors of the United States Category:Union Army officers ","title":"Benjamin Harrison Eaton"},{"id":"1427113","text":"Snowshill, showing the War Memorial in the Churchyard Snowshill ( , ) is a small Cotswolds village and civil parish in Gloucestershire, England, located near Broadway, Worcestershire.

Neighbouring towns include Ulm, Senden, Pfaffenhofen an der Roth, Holzheim, Nersingen and Elchingen. The population is 51,110 (30 June 2005). ==History== The modern history of Neu-Ulm began with the change of the sovereignty over the city of Ulm in 1810 from the Kingdom of Bavaria to the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. The Danube became the boundary between Bavaria and W√ºrttemberg. Land on the right bank of the Danube thus remained under Bavarian sovereignty. This was the beginning of Neu-Ulm's status as an independent town. At this time Neu-Ulm was very small with little more than a few houses, taverns, pieces of land, and the village of Offenhausen. It was still known as \\"Ulm am rechten Donauufer (Ulm on the right-hand side of the Danube). The name \\"Neu- Ulm\\" was first mentioned in records in 1814. The town's real growth began a few decades later in 1841, when the Frankfurter Bundesversammlung announced the building of the Federal Fort of Ulm, the Bundesfestung. Upon the wishes of King Ludwig I, Neu-Ulm was included within the fort and the building work in Neu-Ulm was overseen by Major Theodor von Hildebrandt.Description: The German federation and its fortresses After Neu-Ulm was connected to the railway line to Augsburg in 1853, soldiers arrived and a garrison was created there. The city began to blossom under Mayor Josef Kollmann at the end of the 19th century. A tram line connecting Ulm and Neu-Ulm was built in 1897 and in 1900 the water tower (still a landmark today) was built, guaranteeing Neu-Ulm's water supply. In 1906, Neu-Ulm expanded beyond the city walls for the first time. The first factories were built, and it continued to expand. After World War I, the garrison was closed. The population and wealth of the town grew, and it became a rich town. However, World War II left its mark; nearly eighty percent of the town was destroyed by Allied bombing, and all bridges across the Danube to Ulm were destroyed. Rebuilding began, and from the end of World War II up to the 1990s, the US Army were stationed in Neu-Ulm. In 1968 the 1st Battalion, 81st Field Artillery Regiment moved from Wackernheim to Wiley Barracks. It was initially equipped with eight Pershing 1 nuclear missiles and in 1969 replaced these with 36 Pershing 1a missiles, replacing these with Pershing II missiles in 1984. The battalion was inactivated in 1986 and reformed as the 1st Battalion, 9th Field Artillery Regiment. With the ratification of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty on 27 May 1988 the missiles were destroyed and the battalion was inactivated on 30 June 1991. The departure of the US Army had a large impact on the town's economy, and also left a large number of vacant army buildings. ==Coat of arms== In 1857, the town was given a coat of arms, although it was not legally a city at the time. It was first granted city status by King Ludwig II in 1869. The coat of arms consists of three horizontal bands of black, white and blue, with a tower in front. The tower symbolises the fort built around Neu-Ulm, the colours black and silver indicate the relationship with Ulm, and the colours white and blue show the association with Bavaria. ==Districts== Neu-Ulm is arranged into 14 districts, 9 of them added between 1972 and 1977. The districts are: Burlafingen, Finningen, Gerlenhofen, Hausen, Holzschwang (including Tiefenbach), Jedelhausen, Ludwigsfeld, Neu-Ulm, Offenhausen, Pfuhl, Reutti, Schwaighofen, Steinheim and Wiley. ==Politics== Neu-Ulm is currently controlled by the Christian Social Union (CSU). On 11 January 2004, the acting deputy mayor Gerold Noerenberg was elected mayor. He succeeded Dr Beate Merk, who had been appointed as Bavarian law minister by Edmund Stoiber on 14 October 2003. The town council is arranged into four parliamentary groups with eight different parties and citizens' initiatives (the number of seats are shown in brackets): * Christian Social Union (CSU) (16) * Green Party (11) * Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) (5) * Free Voters' Union (FWG) (4) * Pro Neu-Ulm (3) * Free Democratic Party (FDP) (2) * Young Union (2) * The Left (Germany) (1) ==Education and science== In 1994, the Neu-Ulm \\"Fachhochschule\\" (University of Applied Sciences) was founded. The School of Economics was first opened as a branch office of the Fachhochschule Kempten im Allg√§u, but has been independent since 1998. The \\"Fachhochschule Neu-Ulm\\" was initially located in the buildings of the former US base‚Äôs ‚ÄúWiley Barracks‚Äù, before expanding into two floors of the newly built \\"Edison Center\\" and then transferring to a new, larger building on the site of the former US base in summer 2008. ==Personalities== ===Born in Neu-Ulm=== * Otto Renner (1883‚Äì1960), botanist * Robert Wehgartner (1909‚Äì1974), politician, president of Bayernpartei Bavaria Party (1963‚Äì1966) * Otto Haxel (1909‚Äì1998), nuclear physician * Justus Herrenberger (1920‚Äì2014), architect and professor * Willi Habermann (1922‚Äì2001), Swabian poet who belonged in his youth to the Friends of the White Rose * Alfred Hans Zoller (1928‚Äì2006), composer of church songs, organ player * Gerold Noerenberg (born 1957), Lord Mayor of Neu-Ulm * Bine Br√§ndle (born 1975), designer * Edwin Jackson, (born 1983), American Major League Baseball pitcher for league record 14 teams * Hermann K√∂hl, (1888‚Äì1938), German flight pioneer.

He served as the sixth Governor of the State of Colorado from 1889 to 1891. ==Early life== Job Adams Cooper was born in Greenville, Illinois, to Charles and Maria Hadley Cooper, one of seven children. The future Governor attended Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, but took a leave of absence to fight in the American Civil War for the Union Army. Cooper enlisted as a sergeant in the 137th Illinois Volunteer Infantry, and was stationed in Memphis, Tennessee, during the Confederate raid on the city by troopers under the command of General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Following the war, he returned to complete his studies. Upon graduation from Knox College in 1867, he returned to his hometown of Greenville and was admitted to practice law in Illinois. That same year, he married Jane O. Barnes, the daughter of a prominent minister, and they had four children together. Leaving his family behind in 1872, he accompanied A. C. Phelps on a westward journey hoping to find entrepreneurial opportunities, and eventually settled in Denver, Colorado, where they started the law firm of Phelps and Cooper. In between 1872 and 1888, Cooper expanded his business interests to include insurance, banking, mining, and the cattle industry. ==Governor of Colorado== In 1888, Cooper was nominated for Governor, and went on to defeat Rocky Mountain News editor Thomas M. Patterson in the general election. Following his inauguration as the state's sixth Governor in January, 1889, he signed legislation that created thirteen new counties, including: Baca, Cheyenne, Kiowa, Kit Carson, Lincoln, Montezuma, Morgan, Otero, Phillips, Prowers, Rio Blanco, Sedgwick, and Yuma. Furthermore, he opened a state orphans home in Denver and a state reformatory in Chaffee County. ==Retirement== Cooper declined to seek reelection in 1890, and returned to his law practice. He later formed a construction business and built Denver's Cooper Building. From 1893 to 1897, he served as President of the local Chamber of Commerce. He died at 55 and is buried in Denver's Fairmount Cemetery. ==Family life== He had a daughter, Mary Louisa Cooper, wife of geologist and railroadman, Lucius Seymour Storrs.

He was significant in the development of early film technology. Woodville Latham was the father of Grey Latham and Otway Latham, owners of a kinetoscope parlor in New York City. In December 1894 Latham and his two sons formed the Lambda Company at 35 Frankfort Street, employing Eug√®ne Lauste, a former Thomas Edison employee, as well as motion picture pioneer William Kennedy Dickson. Dickson would not leave Edison's employ until April 1895 and initially lent his expertise to the Lathams in secret. The Eidoloscope was demonstrated for members of the press on April 21, 1895 and opened to the paying public on May 20, in a lower Broadway store with films of the Griffo- Barnett prize boxing fight, taken from Madison Square Garden's roof on May 4. It was the first commercial projection. In 1898 the Lathams abandoned motion pictures and soon lost their patents. Major Latham outlived his sons; by 1910 both Otway and Grey, who are said to have been hedonistic in nature, had died. Latham, aided by the collaboration of Dickson and Lauste, is notable for the invention of the Latham loop inside movie cameras and projectors, a significant development in the history of cinema because it allowed motion pictures to be continuously shot and projected for a much longer period than the one-minute films of Thomas Edison's kinetoscope.

The system is administered by Fulton County. The system is composed of the Central Library in Downtown Atlanta, which serves as the library headquarters, as well as the Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History, and 33 branch libraries. ==History== ===The Young Men's Library Association=== The origins of the public library system lie in the Young Men's Library Association (YMLA), a subscription library system established in 1867. The YMLA was open to the public, but only paying members could check out books. Membership was restricted to white men until 1873 when white women were allowed to join. The YMLA system remained the de facto library system of the city for the rest of the century. During the 1890s, however, the YMLA, Andrew Carnegie, and the City of Atlanta, started to work out the details of a new public library in Atlanta. ===The Carnegie Library=== Carnegie Library (1902‚Äì1977) On March 4, 1902, the first public library, the Carnegie Library, opened on the site of the current Central Library. When the library opened, only the basement, the stacks, and the children's room were completed. The Carnegie Library remained the main library of the system for most of the century. The library was renovated in 1950 and 1966 through city bond funding. Before 1950 the system was referred to as the Carnegie Library, but to commemorate the renovation of the central Carnegie Library the system was renamed the Atlanta Public Library in 1950. It was in this building that 20 gay men were arrested following a police stakeout in September 1953, an event known at the Atlanta Public Library perversion case. In 1977 the Carnegie Library was torn down to make way for the current Central Library. However, the building's architectural bays were preserved, and used to create the Carnegie Education Pavilion, a monument to higher education in Atlanta. ===Expansion of the library system=== The Carnegie Library was so successful that within a year after the opening of the library, Carnegie suggested he would give more money to open branch libraries. In 1906 Carnegie formally offered $30,000 for the construction of two branch libraries, as long as the city provided a site and arranged financial support for the library. The Anne Wallace Library, named in honor of the first Carnegie Library librarian, opened in 1909 on the corner of Luckie Street and Merritts Avenue in Northwest Atlanta. Many new branch libraries followed in the years to come. The Ragsdale branch, located in Oakland City, opened in 1912, and in 1913 the Uncle Remus Branch opened in the West End home of Joel Chandler Harris. Over the next century the library system has expanded from four branches in 1913 to the 34 branches operating today. By 1924 the library system had eight branches throughout the city, and by 1967 the system had 19 branches. ===City‚Äìcounty relationship=== In the first decades of the library system service was maintained for Atlanta residents only, and as a result Fulton County was left without library service. Using Works Progress Administration and city funds, the City of Atlanta and the Fulton County Board of Commissioners signed a contract in 1935 to provide library coverage throughout the county. In 1982, however, Georgia passed a constitutional amendment that allowed the city to transfer control of the system to the county, and in 1983 the system was turned over the county control. To reflect the change in control the system was renamed the Atlanta‚ÄìFulton Public Library System. ===Black Atlantans and the public library=== When the Carnegie Library opened in 1902, blacks were excluded from the library. Activist W. E. B. Du Bois led an unsuccessful campaign for black representation and equal use of the library, or at the very least a branch library for blacks, but the library board rebuffed his efforts. Carnegie had offered funds for a black branch library, but the library system did not use the money until 1921 when Tommie Dora Barker, the Director of the Carnegie Library School, opened the Auburn Avenue Branch Library, the first branch library for blacks, in the Sweet Auburn neighborhood. During segregation two other libraries were opened for the use of blacks. In 1959, Irene Dobbs Jackson, the mother of future Atlanta mayor Maynard Jackson requested a library card for the central library. After days of public furor, the library board voted to allow blacks full access to the library on 19 May 1959. Between 1966 and 1973 the library staff was desegregated. ===2008 bond referendum=== In 2008 Fulton County voters approved a $275 million library bond referendum, which provides money for renovation and construction of library facilities in Fulton County. The plan includes money for eight new libraries, a new central library, expansions of two libraries, and renovations of 23 branch libraries. Five libraries will be built in Alpharetta, Milton, Northwest Atlanta, Wolf Creek, and Stewart-Lakewood. The Alpharetta and Stewart-Lakewood libraries will replace existing libraries, the Northwest Atlanta library will replace three small branch libraries, and the Milton and Wolf Creek libraries will be completely new. A new library will be built in Palmetto/Chattahoochee Hill County, and two new libraries will be built in Southeast Atlanta and East Roswell. The Southeast Atlanta library will replace three small branch libraries. In the original Library Facility Master Plan $34 million was allocated to fully restore and upgrade the site. In the final referendum, however, $84 million was provided for the construction of a new central library. Finally, the Auburn Avenue Research Library and the South Fulton branch library will be expanded. ==Central Library== The Central Library The Central Library in Downtown Atlanta serves as the headquarters of the library system.\\"Central Library & Library System Headquarters.\\" Atlanta‚ÄìFulton Public Library System. Retrieved on June 29, 2017. Completed in 1980, it was the last building to be designed by Bauhaus-movement architect Marcel Breuer. The building, designed in the brutalist architectural style, is considered a \\"masterpiece\\" by architectural experts, such as Barry Bergdoll, the Chief Architectural Curator of the Museum of Modern Art, and is closely related to the Whitney Museum of Art building (currently the Met Breuer museum). Breuer was unable to attend the dedication ceremonies on May 25, 1980, and he died a year later on July 1, 1981 at the age of 81. The concept for the design dates back to 1969, but the contract was not awarded to Breuer until 1976, because of disputes between the library administration and city government over the bond referendum needed to raise the $18.9 million for construction of the library. Construction began in 1977, and when the structure was completed in 1980 it featured a 300-seat theater, six stories of library space, and a restaurant. The building was built for a capacity of 1,000 users and 1 million volumes. The structure consists of a steel frame and concrete slabs, and the exterior is composed of precast concrete panels that were bush-hammered for texture. Concrete was chosen as the material because concrete allowed for the most economical implementation of the special shapes required for the recessed windows and splayed reveals. The second, third, and fourth stories are connected by a monumental concrete staircase. Since 1980, however, the state-of-the-art facilities have deteriorated. The theater was closed during the mid-1990s after water from a leaking concrete planter above the theater collapsed parts of the ceiling, but has since been renovated due to recent interest in the building. Although the restaurant was busy and successful during the early years it was closed during the late 1990s. Furthermore, the brutalist architectural style of the library is not fully appreciated in Atlanta. In an effort to mute the harshness of the style, the system spent $5 million to renovate the building in 2002. The money was spent on a new carpet with colorful highlights and more colorful walls. A full renovation would have cost an estimated $34 million. Nonetheless, it still remains unclear as to what will happen to the Breuer building. However, a multi-year preservation effort led by artist, writer and historian, Max Eternity, ignited a renewed interest in the building, and the library was listed on the 2010 World Monuments Watch List of Most Endangered Sites. Various news outlets, including National Public Radio (NPR), reported in July 2016 that \\"the Fulton County Board of Commissioners voted unanimously...not to tear down the building.\\" ==Branches== ==Library systems in neighboring counties== *West Georgia Regional Library to the west. *Cobb County Public Library System to the west. *Sequoyah Regional Library System to the north west. *Forsyth County Public Library to the north east. *Gwinnett County Public Library to the east. *DeKalb County Public Library to the east. *Clayton County Library System to the south east. *Flint River Regional Library System to the south. *Coweta Public Library System to the south. ==References== ==External links== *Atlanta‚ÄìFulton Public Library System website *\\"One of Finest Libraries in South\\", Atlanta Georgian and News, December 24, 1909 from the Atlanta Historic Newspapers Archive in the Digital Library of Georgia.

Archeological findings show that the local population was hunting wild game: foxes, deer, badgers, wolves, bears, whose skins were later manufactured. The nobility would wear game skin shoes, the poorer ones would wear calf or swine skin. In the past the traditional shoes were handcrafted out of leather processed at home. The piece of leather had to be larger than the sole, with holes on the side so that a thin string of leather can be filled in and it wraps the piece of leather around the foot, giving it the form of some footwear. The puckered form gave it a sharp tip. They would be worn over wool stockings or white pieces of clothing. Nowadays they are often used as part of the traditional costume by folk dance groups and folk artists. Dacian moccasins as seen in a statue at Museum Capitolini. Until 50 years ago, they were usually worn in rural areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Romania and Serbia.Eliznik.org.uk, South East Europe costume, peasant sandals Nowadays, they are only used in folk costume, for folkloric dance ensembles, festivals, feast days or other cultural events.

The glacier was named after the geologist Samuel Franklin Emmons after his involvement in a survey of Mount Rainier in 1870. Starting at an elevation of over , the Emmons glacier flows down eastward. Near the Disappointment Cleaver at , the Emmons is joined by the Ingraham Glacier flowing to the south. The glaciers flow together and remain connected until they split up upon reaching the wedge of Little Tahoma Peak. As the Emmons flows northeast, the massive glacier descends until it reaches its rocky lower terminus at about in elevation. In the 1930s, the glacier was found to be receding quickly. However, in 1963, a rock fall from Little Tahoma Peak covered the lower glacier with rock debris. The debris cover insulated the ice from melting. As a result of decreased melting, the glacier advanced rapidly in the early 1980s. That advance was continuing by 1992, but at a slower rate; ice beneath the rock debris was melting irregularly and forming a vast hummocky area. By 2003, the glacier was again retreating. \\"In the past few decades the glaciers [in the American West] have been receding, continuing a trend from the Little Ice Age.\\" Emmons Glacier is often used as a route (the Columbia Crest route) to climb to the summit of Mount Rainier.

After his wife Frances died in November 1880, he moved to Aspen. In Aspen he started the local newspaper and was secretary of the local assembly of the Knights of Labor. He remarried to Celia O. Maltby (n√©e Crane) on January 8, 1885. They had one son, Frank Hanson Waite. ===Political career=== Waite had been elected to the Wisconsin Legislature as a Republican and had run a Republican newspaper in New York. In Colorado he edited the Union Era, a reform paper, and helped to organized the People's Party (Populists) national convention. In 1892 he was nominated as the Populist candidate for Governor of Colorado and he was inaugurated on January 10, 1893. A passionate supporter of the Populist's Omaha Platform, he was nicknamed \\"Bloody Bridles\\" for an 1893 speech, in which he proclaimed, \\"It is better, infinitely better that blood should flow to the horses' bridles rather than our national liberties should be destroyed.\\"Lawrence Goodwin, The Populist Moment: A Short History of the Agrarian Revolt in America. New York: Oxford University Press, 1978; pg. 185. His election coincided with the Panic of 1893 which hit the silver mining industry in Colorado particularly hard. In 1894, the Western Federation of Miners went on a five-month strike and Waite intervened on behalf of the union, ordering the deployment of the state militia to support and protect the miners.Holbrook, Stewart. The Rocky Mountain Revolution. New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1956. That same year Waite supported the American Railroad Union during the national Pullman Strike. As governor he was also instrumental in the passage of women's suffrage in Colorado, the second state to do so. ===1894 Denver \\"City Hall War\\"=== In 1893, a new municipal charter was given to Denver by the state legislature that decentralized much of the mayor's powers into six different administrative departments, two of which were elected, two appointed by the mayor, and the remaining two appointed by the governor. The municipal board members appointed by the governor had complete financial control over the police, fire, and excise departments. Governor Waite tried to overturn the corruption in Denver in 1894 by removing police and fire commissioners that he thought were shielding gamblers and prostitutes. The officials refused to leave their positions and were quickly joined by others who felt their jobs were threatened. They barricaded themselves in City Hall, and the state militia were sent to remove them. Federal troops were called in from nearby Fort Logan to intervene and quell the civil strife. Eventually Governor Waite agreed to withdraw the militia and allow the state Supreme Court to decide the case. The court ruled that the governor had authority to replace the commissioners, but he was reprimanded for bringing in the militia, in what became known as the \\"City Hall War\\". He was defeated for reelection in 1894, but continued to be active in the Populist movement until his death in 1901. ===Death and legacy=== Waite died on November 27, 1901 while preparing Thanksgiving dinner at his home in Aspen. His house on West Francis Street in Aspen has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. == Footnotes == ==Further reading== * David B.

Created in 1442 by King Afonso V of Portugal for his uncle Afonso, Count of Barcelos (natural son of John I of Portugal), it is one of the oldest fiefdoms in Portugal. After the accession of the House of Braganza to the Portuguese throne in 1640, following the House of Habsburg, the heir to the throne of Portugal was styled as the Duke of Braganza (see that article for further developments of the dukedom) together with Prince of Brazil, and later Prince Royal of Portugal. After the foundation of the Portuguese Republic in 1910, the tradition of the heir to the throne being titled Duke of Braganza was revived by some pretenders to signify their claims to the throne. ==History== The Duchy of Braganza, a Dukedom, was created in 1442 by king Afonso V of Portugal for his uncle Afonso, Count of Barcelos (natural son of John I of Portugal). Along with the duchies of Coimbra and Viseu created by John I for his sons Peter and Henry after their capture of Ceuta from the Moors in 1415, it is one of the first duchies of Portugal. By 1640, Portugal was on the verge of rebellion and a new Portuguese king had to be found. The choice fell upon the eighth duke, John II of Braganza, who had a claim both through his grandmother, Infanta Catherine, and through his great-great-grandfather, the 4th duke, nephew of King Manuel. The duke was a modest man without particular ambitions to the crown. Legend says that his wife, Leonor of Guzman, daughter of the duke of Medina-Sid√≥nia, urged him to accept the offer saying, I'd rather be Queen for one day than duchess for a lifetime. He accepted the leadership of the rebellion, which was successful, and was acclaimed John IV of Portugal on December 1, 1640. After the accession of the Braganzas to the throne, the duchy was linked to the Crown and the Duke of Braganza became the traditional title of the heir to the Crown, together with or alternate to Prince of Beira, much as Prince of Wales is in the United Kingdom. The fief itself became merged in the crown. ==See also== * List of Portuguese monarchs * Portuguese House of Burgundy * House of Aviz * House of Habsburg * House of Braganza * House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha * Timeline of Portuguese history ==External links== *Dukes of Braganza genealogy in a Portuguese genealogical site Category:Dukes of Braganza Category:Portuguese monarchy Category:Kingdom of Portugal de:Haus Braganza es:Dinast√≠a de Braganza fr:Dynastie de Bragance pl:Bragan√ßa (dynastia) pt:Dinastia de Bragan√ßa ","title":"Duchy of Braganza"},{"id":"1427237","text":"was a professor of engineering.

He became a professor in the Department of Civil Engineering in 1966 before his retirement in 1996, and also held an appointment in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Dr. Mura was appointed Walter P. Murphy Professor in the McCormick School of Engineering at Northwestern, was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in 1986 for his contributions to the field of micromechanics, and received many other accolades for his work. He was as much recognized for his academic achievement as his generosity in opening his home to visiting scholars and graduate students from Japan, where weekend gatherings were a regular occurrence. Dr. Mura was interested in the micromechanics of solids. Examples of micromechanics are theories on fracture and fatigue of materials, mathematical analysis for dislocations and inclusions in solids, mechanical characterization of thin films, ceramics and composite materials. Professor Mura was also interested in the inverse problems. His research aimed to predict inelastic damages in solids by knowing surface displacements on the surface of the solids, including prediction of earthquake by knowing the earth surface. The inverse problems play an important role in qualitative nondestructive evaluation of materials. Most of Professor Mura's research was mathematically oriented but cooperative with experiments in mechanics and materials science.

His father's side of the family was deeply religious and originally came from Ohio. Vernie graduated from Valparaiso University and was a teacher for 43 years. Vernie also owned a hardware store in Leiters Ford, was a trustee for Aubbeenaubbee Township, President of the Woodlawn Hospital Board of Trustees, and President of the Leiters Ford Merchants Association. His father was a Scottish Rite Freemason and a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. In 1915, Vernie married Pearl Irene Wright, whose family was also from Ohio and involved with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Otis Bowen is a distant relative of George H. W. Bush through two brothers who immigrated to New England from Somerset, England. Bowen received his elementary and high school education from local schools and went on to graduate from Indiana University Bloomington with an A.B. in 1939 and the Indiana University School of Medicine with an M.D. in 1942. At IU, he became a member of the Delta Chi fraternity as well as the Phi Beta Pi medical fraternity. He holds 30 honorary degrees including those from schools in his home state such as Indiana University, the University of Notre Dame, Ball State University, Valparaiso University, and Anderson University. In addition to an honorary degree, Bethel College also named their campus library in his honor. He married Elizabeth Anne Steinmann in 1939, who died shortly before his term as Indiana Governor expired in 1981. They had four children; Rick, Judy, Tim, and Rob. Following her death, he married Rose May Hochstetler in September 1981. In 1991, Rose died. In 1992, he married Carol Hahn, a marriage that lasted until his death. ==Career== President Gerald Ford in 1976 Bowen being sworn in as Secretary of Health and Human Services in 1985 Bowen began his career as an intern at Memorial Hospital in South Bend, Indiana, in 1942. From 1943 to 1946 he served in the Medical Corps of the United States Army, rising from the rank of 1st lieutenant to captain. On his return from World War II, he set up his own medical practice in his home town of Bremen, Indiana, which he discontinued in 1972. As a physician he was instrumental in helping establish a community hospital for Bremen in 1956. During this time, he also was a member of staff for various hospitals in Indiana and served as coroner for Marshall County, Indiana. In 1981 he took up the post of clinical professor of family medicine at Indiana University. During his medical and teaching career, Bowen also got into Republican Party politics, serving as a member of the Indiana House of Representatives from 1956 to 1958 and again from 1960 to 1972. He was speaker of the house from 1967 to 1972, Vice Chairman of the legislative council from 1967 to 1968, and Chairman until 1972. After his unsuccessful attempt in 1968, he was elected Governor of Indiana in 1972 and was re-elected for a second term in 1976, making him the first Governor to serve for eight consecutive years in Indiana since 1851. His campaign slogan, featured in huge letters on billboards, was \\"Otis Bowen. He Hears You\\". His tenure in Indiana's highest public office was marked by a major tax restructuring reducing reliance on property taxes, major improvements to state park facilities, development of a statewide emergency medical services system, and adoption of a medical malpractice law that was destined to become a national model. From 1978 to 1985, he also served on the board of trustees for Valparaiso University. Simultaneously, Bowen served as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, and the Midwestern Governors Association, and the National Governors Association. In 1980, he served as President of the Council of State Governments. Bowen continued teaching at Indiana University until he was appointed by President Reagan as Secretary of Health and Human Services and confirmed by the U.S. Senate on a vote of 93 to 2, making him the first medical doctor to serve in this position. At the time of his appointment, criticism was rising that the Reagan Administration was not doing enough to respond to AIDS. Although not as prominent in his advocacy for AIDS issues as then-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, Bowen did offer explicit warnings about the threats posed by the disease, including its risk to heterosexuals. By 1987, he warned that the threat posed by AIDS could rival deadly health disasters like the Black Death, smallpox, and typhoid if more was not done to combat the threat posed by the disease. The following year, after new studies were released showing that the spread of the disease was slowing within many population groups, he commented that \\"We do not expect any explosion into the heterosexual population.\\" It is said that as Secretary of Health and Human Services, he always had a prescription pad handy, recommending remedies to treat minor ailments for both colleagues and members of the press. He served in that position until 1989, when he retired to his home in Bremen, Indiana. ==Community involvement== Bowen at a community event in 2007 Bowen served on a number of committees and conferences, including the Education Commission of the States, and the President's Commission on Federalism. He was the chairman of the Paperwork Commission, Nursing Study Commission, and Medicare Study Commission. He also received various awards, including the George F. Hixson award from Kiwanis International. Bowen was a Lutheran and member of the American Medical Association, the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Alpha Omega Alpha, Phi Beta Pi, Delta Chi, and Kiwanis. The Bowen Center for Public Affairs was founded by Ball State University in honor of Bowen. He attended the Bowen Institute on Political Participation every year and provided a congratulatory address to the graduates of this two-day seminar. The Otis R. Bowen Museum, located on the campus of Bethel College, houses memorabilia and artifacts related to Dr. Otis Bowen's years as Governor of Indiana and Secretary of Health and Human Services. It also houses a copy of the Bust of Otis Bowen. ==Death== Bowen died May 4, 2013, at a nursing home in Donaldson, Indiana.

It is a widespread species which is a resident breeder in sub-Saharan Africa from Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya south to South Africa, and in The Gambia, Senegal, C√¥te d'Ivoire and Chad in west Africa. Considered Endangered in South Africa. This is a close relative of the widespread Asian and Australian black-necked stork, the only other member of the genus Ephippiorhynchus. ==Description== In flight This is a huge bird that regularly attains a height of , a length of and a wingspan. The male is larger and heavier than the female, with a range of , with a mean mass of . The female is usually between , with a mean mass of .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, 2nd Edition by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (2008), . It is probably the tallest of the storks (though not the heaviest), due in no small part to it extremely long legs (tarsus length is up to ). The long bill measures from .Hancock & Kushan, Storks, Ibises and Spoonbills of the World. Princeton University Press (1992), The sexes can be readily distinguished by the golden yellow irises of the female and the brown irises and dangling yellow wattles of the male. It is spectacularly plumaged; both the female and male appear identical when perched but the female shows much more white in the primaries in flight. The head, neck, back, wings, and tail are iridescent black, with the rest of the body and the primary flight feathers being white. Juveniles are browner grey in plumage. The massive bill is red with a black band and a yellow frontal shield (the \\"saddle\\"). The legs and feet are black with pink hocks. On the chest is a bare red patch of skin, whose colour darkens during breeding season. ==Behaviour== They are silent except for bill-clattering at the nest. Like most storks, these fly with the neck outstretched, not retracted like a heron; in flight, the large heavy bill is kept drooping somewhat below belly height, giving these birds a very unusual appearance to those who see them for the first time. To experienced birdwatchers on the other hand, this makes them easily recognizable even if seen from a distance. It has been suggested that due to the large size and unusual appearance in flight, this species is the basis for the \\"big bird\\" and kongamato cryptids. ===Habitat=== At the continental scale, saddle-billed storks preferred protected areas that have a higher extent of open water compared to areas without the storks. Some of these trends may, however, be due to a bias in coverage by ornithologists of safer areas such as national parks and protected swamps that afford easier accessibility and comforts. ===Breeding=== The saddle-billed stork breeds in forested waterlands and other floodlands in tropical lowland. It builds a large, deep stick nest in a tree, laying one or two white eggs weighing about each. It does not form breeding colonies, and is usually found alone or in pairs. The incubation period is 30‚Äì35 days, with another 70 ‚Äì 100 days before the chicks fledge. ===Food and feeding=== Fishing in Botswana The saddle-billed stork, like most of its relatives, feeds mainly on fish, frogs and crabs, but also on small birds and reptiles. They move in a deliberate and stately manner as they hunt, in a similar way to the larger herons. ==Relation to Ancient Egyptian culture== This bird is represented in an Ancient Egyptian hieroglyph (Gardiner G29) that had the phonetic value \\"bÍú£\\": G29 Its description is often erroneously given as \\"jabiru\\", which is a South American relative. The Third Dynasty pharaoh Khaba incorporated this hieroglyph in his name (Jim√©nez Serrano 2002). The first depictions of the species come from depictions during the Late Predynastic Period (pre-3150 B.C.), and trends in depictions have been useful to deduce a decline in the species' range from ancient Egypt likely due to intensifying urbanisation and an increasingly arid climate (c. 2686-2181 BC). ==References== *Barlow, Clive (1997): A field guide to birds of the Gambia and Senegal.

He had lost an eye in a childhood accident so could not be a soldier. Instead he was a journalist for Basque language newspapers. His actions caused him to be arrested after the Spanish Civil War and he was sentenced to death for his activities; legend has it that he escaped the firing squad only through an administrative oversight. Released, he returned to his studies in Vitoria and went on to take holy orders. Arizmendi wanted to continue his studies in Belgium but was assigned to a parish 30 miles from his own home town. He arrived in Arrasate (in Spanish, Mondrag√≥n) in February 1941, as a 26-year-old newly ordained priest to be assistant curate, to find a town still suffering from the aftermath of the Civil War and severe unemployment. Arizmendi did not impress his new flock. Their one-eyed priest read badly; one parishioner described him thus: \\"He spoke in a monotone with intricate and repetitive phraseology difficult to understand. He hardly ever [read] with grace.\\" They initially asked the Bishop to replace him. Nevertheless, he was determined to find a way to assist his congregation and realised that economic development - jobs - was the key to solutions to the town's other problems. Co-operatives appeared the best way to achieve this. Co-operatives, both consumer and worker, and self-help organisations had a long tradition in the Basque Country but had died away after the War. In his quest for community welfare, he started to focus his efforts on vocational training, such as the school providing Uni√≥n Cerrajera, a flagship factory of Arrasate. However, his attempts to enhance and expand the school were not welcomed by the management. He focused instead on creating another school, for which he relied on donations and popular subscription. In 1943, Arizmendi set up a Polytechnic School,Jose M¬™ Arizmendiarrieta. Mondragon Corporation. now the Mondrag√≥n University, a democratically administered educational centre open to all young people in the region. The Polytechnic School provided the springboard for students of different backgrounds to new jobs apart from the Uni√≥n Cerrajera. Now Arizmendiarrieta was intent on creating a company catering to the positions required by the students graduating from the School. That took the name of Ulgor, after the initials of the entrepreneurs embarking on the venture. It transformed soon on into Fagor. Arizmendi died in 1976 in Arrasate. ==See also== *Mondragon Corporation ==References== ==Sources== * Joxe Azurmendi: El hombre cooperativo * Azurmendi, Joxe 2016: \\"Pertsona kooperatzaileaz\\" in Gizabere kooperatiboaz, Donostia: Jakin * Iban Galletebeitia: \\"Ereiterik bada desertuan, J.M.

They applied to join the Yorkshire League for the following season, and after being advised that pub teams were not allowed in the league, adopted the name Garforth Miners. In 1978 Garforth were elected to Division Three of the Yorkshire League. They finished second-from-bottom of the table in their first season, but were Division Three runners-up in 1979‚Äì80, earning promotion to Division Two. When the league merged with the Midland League in 1982 to form the Northern Counties East League, the club were placed in Division One North. In 1985 they were renamed again, becoming Garforth Town. League reorganisation saw them placed in Division Two in 1985 and they went on to finish as runners-up, earning promotion to Division One. Although they were Division One runners-up in 1996‚Äì97, also winning the League Trophy, the club were not promoted to the Premier Division.

The series of six weekly episodes began broadcasting on 11 February 2005 on Channel 4. Described by his creator as a \\"meaningless strutting cadaver-in- waiting\\", the character originated on Brooker's TVGoHome ‚Äì a website parodying television listings ‚Äì as the focus of a fly-on-the-wall documentary called Cunt. ==Plot== Nathan Barley, played by Nicholas Burns, is a webmaster, guerrilla filmmaker, screenwriter, DJ and in his own words, a \\"self- facilitating media node\\". Whilst desperate to convince himself and others that he is the epitome of urban cool, Nathan is secretly terrified he might not be, which is why he reads Sugar Ape magazine, his bible of cool. Sugar Ape has been described as a spoof of Dazed & Confused and Vice, although Brooker has stated that \\"the SugarApe \\"Vice\\" issue from Ep5 wasn't an assault on Vice magazine I think it just (understandably) ended up looking that way\\". The website consists of stupid pranks caught on camera, photos of him with attractive women and famous figures (some of them digitally edited to insert himself), and photos of him standing on street corners in major cities around the world. The humour derives from the rapid rise of both the Internet and digital media, and the assumption by publishers and broadcasters that almost any such work is worthy of attention. Barley and his peers are often hired ahead of actual journalists and talented writers trying to make intelligent points, such as the earnest documentary filmmaker Claire Ashcroft (Claire Keelan), and her brother Dan (Julian Barratt), the series' two other central characters. Claire seeks to highlight the plight of the inner city's homeless and drug-dependent; Dan is a jaded, opinionated and apathetic hack who, having written an article for Sugar Ape entitled \\"The Rise of the Idiots\\", is appalled to find that \\"the idiots\\" in question ‚Äì Nathan and his contemporaries ‚Äì have adopted him as their spiritual leader, failing to see that they are the very people he was criticising. While Dan sees a clear distinction between himself and the \\"idiots\\", he's frequently forced to compromise his own ethics in order to earn a living, and seems to be fighting the dawning realisation that he may actually be the very thing he despises. At the same time, Claire, who clearly wants to see herself as socially responsible and philanthropic, is doggedly determined to further her own career. Other recurring characters include Nathan's idiot flatmate Toby (Rhys Thomas) and the staff at Dan Ashcroft's magazine, Sugar Ape: asinine chief editor Jonatton Yeah? (Charlie Condou), Ned Smanks (Richard Ayoade) and Rufus Onslatt (Spencer Brown), a pair of gormless graphic designers, and receptionist Sasha (Nina Sosanya). Barley has an inoffensive young assistant called Pingu (Ben Whishaw). The eccentric and ludicrous Doug Rocket, founder member of The Veryphonics, and played by comedian David Hoyle (a spoof of Dave Stewart of Eurythmics), also appears in several episodes. Dan Ashcroft's flatmate is a DJ called \\"Jones\\", who appears blissfully unaware of the antisocial cacophony he creates. Jones is played by Noel Fielding, Barratt's partner in comic duo The Mighty Boosh. ==Cast== *Nicholas Burns ‚Äì Nathan Barley *Julian Barratt ‚Äì Dan Ashcroft *Claire Keelan ‚Äì Claire Ashcroft *Richard Ayoade ‚Äì Ned Smanks *Ben Whishaw ‚Äì Pingu *Rhys Thomas ‚Äì Toby *Noel Fielding ‚Äì Jones *Spencer Brown ‚Äì Rufus Onslatt *Charlie Condou ‚Äì Jonatton Yeah? *David Hoyle ‚Äì Doug Rocket *Nina Sosanya ‚Äì Sasha *Kevin Eldon ‚Äì Nikolai the Barber *Julia Davis ‚Äì Honda Poppet *Benedict Cumberbatch ‚Äì Robin ==Production== ===Pilot=== In the pilot of the show, characters are different from those in the actual series. The character of Claire already knows Nathan and Pingu instead of meeting them in the first episode of the series. The character of Dan is decidedly darker and gets one up on Nathan and the idiots more often. Ned Smanks and Rufus Onslatt do not appear in the pilot, but Spencer Brown does play a minor character in the art gallery scene. Jonattan Yeah? makes a brief appearance and is largely the same. The pilot was never transmitted, but was included as an extra on the DVD. Story elements and some scenes shot for the pilot became used in the third, fourth and fifth episodes of the series, where the familiarity between the characters, and Dan Ashcroft's darker nature, make greater sense in context. ===Promotion=== The series was promoted across the UK with billboards of Barley ostensibly advertising a fictitious mobile telephone, the Wasp T12 Speechtool (\\"it's well weapon\\"). This device was advertised as being exceptionally loud, with several hugely annoying ringtones, a giant key for the number 5 (allegedly the most commonly used digit), a powerful projector, a business card printer and miniature turntables for scratching MP3s. Barley's now-defunct website, www.trashbat.co.ck, served as an official site for the television series. The DVD of the series was released in October 2005, featuring all six episodes, a number of extras (including the pilot), and a booklet written by Nathan featuring his artwork. The artwork in question is largely a parody of prolific graffiti artist Banksy by Shynola. ===Potential second series=== Though the show only aired for one series, in a 2017 interview, Julian Barratt says \\"We did do some work towards a second series back in the day. I think Nathan Barley was going to have a twin brother or something.\\" Charlie Brooker commented in 2016 that the planned storyline for the second series \\"moved away from the style magazine\\", focusing on Barley's \\"financial support being cut off [...] He was left adrift in a world where things were crumbling, and he was less certain of things\\". However, those involved with the show were busy with other projects; Barratt opines that if the show were to return, \\"they would need to approach it differently\\" as \\"everything from it kind of came true\\". == Reception == According to Digital Spy, Nathan Barley was \\"a flop when it originally aired, but a cult hit on DVD\\". It pulled in 700,000 viewers and a 3% share. Reviews were generally favourable,Cookdandbomd.co.uk though some criticised the show's jabs at the dot.com boom as lacking relevance, and believed that the portrayal and parody of the East London hipster was dated. However, the series is lauded today for predicting a future of memes, vloggers and hipsters, and the global influence of social media. Radio Times wrote \\"There are moments of Morris madness and it's a welcome comic oddity, though possibly one with limited appeal outside London's media maelstrom.\\" The Telegraph described the title character as \\"so laughable he makes you want to cry\\". ==Music== Music used in Nathan Barley includes \\"Einstein A Go-Go\\" by Landscape and \\"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\\" by Dead or Alive. ==See also== *Shoreditch Twat *Poe's law *The Booo Krooo *TVGoHome ==References*Trashbat.co.ck ‚Äì Official Website *BBC News: Anatomy of a backlash ‚Äì Nathan in the context of Internet hype *Text from press release for the Nathan Barley show *NTK reference First reference in NTK in Y2K Category:2005 British television series debuts Category:2005 British television series endings Category:2000s British sitcoms Category:Channel 4 sitcoms Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series by Endemol Category:Television series created by Charlie Brooker Category:Television shows set in London Category:2000s British workplace comedy television series Category:Television series created by Chris Morris ","title":"Nathan Barley"},{"id":"1427277","text":"Beckwith may refer to == Places == * Beckwith, North Yorkshire, England * Beckwith, Ontario, township in eastern Ontario, Canada * Beckwith, California, former name of Beckwourth, California * Beckwith, West Virginia == People == * Beckwith baronets, an English title from 1681 to 1796 * Abijah Beckwith (1785‚Äì1874), New York politician * Abijah Beckwith (Wisconsin politician) (1843-1897), Wisconsin politician * Andrew Beckwith (born 1995), American baseball player * Asahel C.

During the Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), Pi was a famous city. At the time of the Three Kingdoms Period, the city is known for the battle between L√º Bu and Cao Cao fought there. It is the location L√º Bu retreated to when under siege by Cao Cao at Xiaopei. He first moved his family there and then he himself after being advised by Chen Gong. It was here that L√º Bu was ultimately defeated at the Battle of Xiapi. During World War II, the Battle of Taierzhuang took place in Tengzhou. In the Chinese Civil War, it was the scene of the Huaihai Campaign. The area is relatively impoverished when compared to the rest of Jiangsu Province.

Bennett was a five-time Pro Bowler, being elected in 1988, and 1990‚Äì1993, and won the AFC Defensive Player of the Year award twice (1988 and 1991). ==Early years== Bennett was born in Birmingham, Alabama. He played halfback and several other positions while attending Ensley High School in Birmingham. Bennett was an excellent basketball and baseball player during his high school career. Bennett was an all-state performer for the football team his senior year, amassing over 1,000 yards on 101 rushes. Bennett was nicknamed \\"Biscuit\\" by friends because he always had room for one more. ==College career== Bennett played for the University of Alabama from 1983‚Äì1986. Bennett was a first selection on the College Football All-America Team three times (1984‚Äì1986). He is one of only two Alabama players to be named to three All-America teams, the other being fellow linebacker Woodrow Lowe. As a senior, he won the Lombardi Award, SEC Player of the Year honors, and finished 7th in the balloting for the Heisman Trophy. In his four seasons at the University of Alabama, Bennett recorded 287 tackles, 21¬Ω sacks, and 3 fumble recoveries. His most famous play was in 1986 when he leveled Notre Dame quarterback Steve Beuerlein, immortalized in a painting by artist Daniel Moore titled simply, ‚ÄòThe Sack.‚Äô In 2005, Bennett was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame. ==Professional career== After his college career, Bennett was selected by the Indianapolis Colts with the second pick of the 1987 NFL Draft. The 1987 draft class was deemed the \\"Year of Linebacker\\", but Bennett was considered to stand \\"head-and-shoulders above the rest.\\" Bennett was Alabama's highest draft selection since quarterback Joe Namath went 12th overall in 1965. Bennett and the Colts were unable to come to an agreement on a contract. Bennett was then dealt to the Buffalo Bills from the Colts in a three-way trade that also included Los Angeles Rams running back Eric Dickerson and Bills running back Greg Bell. This trade occurred in the fall of the 1987 season, just before the trade deadline, and has been called \\"the trade of the decade\\" by The New York Times. In the NFL, Bennett's talent at the left outside linebacker position helped the teams he played for to five Super Bowl appearances (four with Buffalo and one with Atlanta), but they lost them all (an NFL record he shares with offensive lineman Glenn Parker ). In his 14 NFL seasons, he recorded 71¬Ω sacks, 7 interceptions, 112 return yards, 31 forced fumbles, 27 fumble recoveries, 78 fumble return yards, and three touchdowns (one interception, one fumble return, and one blocked field goal return). At the time of his retirement, Bennett's 27 defensive fumble recoveries were the third most in NFL history. Bennett was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 2004. Bennett is a cousin of former New England Patriots defensive end, the late Marquise Hill. ==Personal life== On May 1997, Bennett committed \\"vicious acts\\" during a sexual assault of a woman at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Buffalo. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail for sexual misconduct. He was also placed on three years' probation, fined $500, ordered to perform 100 hours of community service, ordered to pay back $617 in medical bills for the woman, and ordered to undergo anger-management and substance- abuse counseling. Bennett lives in Hollywood, Florida, with his second wife, Kimberly Bennett. In May 2010, Bennett announced he will donate his brain for a study of long-term brain injuries resulting from football-related injuries. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:People from Ensley, Alabama Category:Sportspeople from Birmingham, Alabama Category:Players of American football from Alabama Category:African-American players of American football Category:American football outside linebackers Category:Alabama Crimson Tide football players Category:All-American college football players Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Indianapolis Colts players Category:Buffalo Bills players Category:Atlanta Falcons players Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players ","title":"Cornelius Bennett"},{"id":"1427322","text":"Bound Brook may refer to: *Bound Brook, New Jersey, a borough in Somerset County **Battle of Bound Brook **Bound Brook (NJT station), a railroad station in the above borough *Bound Brook (Raritan River), a tributary of Green Brook in central New Jersey *Bound Brook (Barnstable County, Massachusetts), a river located by Wellfleet, Massachusetts *Bound Brook (Massachusetts river), a small river flowing through South Shore (Massachusetts) ","title":"Bound Brook"},{"id":"1427327","text":"Crotale missile launchers of the French Air Force. The Crotale EDIR (Ecartom√©trie Diff√©rentielle InfraRouge, \\"InfraRed Differential Ecartometry\\") is an all-weather short-range anti-air missile, which can be used to intercept low-flight anti-ship missiles and aircraft. It has been developed by Thomson CSF Matra and exists in two versions, a mobile land-based version and a ship- launched one. == Development == Originally the Crotale R440 system was developed by Rockwell International and Thomson-Houston (and Mistral) in France for South Africa, where it was named Cactus. However, the achievements of the system impressed the French Armed Forces, who purchased the system both for the air force and for the navy. The firing system includes the main sensors of the ship, the firing system of the turret, and a central coordination system. The turret holds eight missiles ready for launch in watertight containers. The magazine behind the turret holds 18 missiles. The French army first utilised a 4x4 wheeled vehicle, armed with four launchers. In order to ensure higher mobility, it was decided to mount the system on the chassis of the French AMX-30 main battle tank. At the same time, the number of launchers were increased to six. In Finnish Army service, the Crotale NG system has been mounted on Sisu Pasi vehicles. Here the number of launchers is eight. The Crotale system has also been installed on various military ships. For instance the French Navy La Fayette class frigates have a Crotale 8-tubed launcher near the helicopter flight deck. == Crotale NG == A modernized version, the Crotale NG (New Generation), entered production in 1990. This version used the new VT-1 missile with Mach 3.5 speed, load factor to 35G, 11 km range, 13 kg warhead (8 m kill-zone) and 6,000 m ceiling. The system includes a S-band Pulse Doppler radar (20 km), Ku-band TWT tracking radar (30 km), Thermal camera (19 km), Daylight CCD camera (15 km), and an IR localiser. An early '90s proposal to fit the system (in its eight-round form) to a Leclerc tank chassis in order to provide a battlefield air defence vehicle for protecting armored formations on the move was not realised due to post-Cold War cutbacks. == K-SAM Pegasus == In 1999, the Republic of Korea Armed Forces awarded a contract to Samsung Thales to jointly develop a South Korean- augmented Crotale NG system for the K-SAM Pegasus short range air defense system. A new sensor system was jointly developed by Samsung and Thales to meet the required operational capability of the upcoming K-SAM Pegasus, as well as a new indigenous missile by LIG Nex1. The electronics and radars were developed by Samsung Electronics. Doosan DST integrated this modified Crotale NG system with a K200 vehicle. 48 units were initially produced for a price- tag of 330 million Euros. A second batch of 66 units was ordered in 2003, valued at 470 million Euros. == Multi-Shield 100 == Thales revealed an updated Crotale NG system with Shikra radar at the Paris Air Show in 2007. The system combines Crotale Mk3 VT-1 missile and Shikra multi-beam search radar, with 150 km (detection range). Thales has demonstrated that the system's VT-1 missile has extended range to 15 km. == Technology == The Crotale missile system consists of two components; a vehicle for transport, equipped with 2-8 launchers; a tracking radar is located between the launchers. A second vehicle carries the surveillance radar. The radar surveillance vehicle can be connected to several launcher vehicles, in order to achieve an effective air- defence system. The Crotale NG has incorporated both the launcher and the surveillance radar in one vehicle. The missile is driven by solid-propellant fuel. It can reach its maximum speed of Mach 2.3 within only two seconds and then follows the radar beam, until its infrared fuze senses that it is near its target and explodes. The surveillance radar and fire direction radar has a range of 20 km and the TV-link works up to 15 km. The TV-guidance system uses both regular and infrared cameras. The system can follow 8 targets simultaneously, and the guidance radar can follow both hovering helicopters as well as fighters exceeding speeds over Mach 2. The Crotale can also use surveillance data from other systems, data from optical surveillance and from the general aerial picture from the national air defence communications system. == Variants == Crotale R440 launchers aboard the frigate Tourville La Fayette class frigate Surcouf. ;R440 Crotale: The original Crotale SAM system, with both land and sea (Sea Crotale) systems. Over 330 systems and several thousand missiles were produced and exported to more than 15 countries. ;HQ-7: China developed the HQ-7 system partly from reverse- engineering Crotale. An improved version, the HQ-7A/FM-90, is known to exist. ;Shahab Thaqeb: In 2002 Iran revealed details concerning a domestically produced surface-to-air missile system, named Shahab Thaqeb. The system, mounted on a 4-wheel trailer, closely resemembled the Chinese HQ-7/FM-80/90 series which Iran had already received. It was unclear whether these systems were actually manufactured in Iran, or whether some portion of the assembly had been conducted domestically. The Ya Zahra air defense system was introduced in 2012. ;R460 SICA (Shahine): Thomson-CSF (now Thales) developed a specific version of the Crotale known as \\"Shahine\\" for Saudi Arabia. The system became operational in 1980. The main visible differences are mainly the carrier (an AMX 30 armoured carrier instead of the non protected classic carrier), and that it carries a six missile firing unit (instead of four). The purpose of the changes was to allow the Shahine firing and acquisition units to follow and protect the armoured units of the Saudi Armed Forces on the battlefield. The Shahine units were among the first vehicles to liberate Kuwait City in February 1991 ‚Äì a picture taken of the scene was widely publicised by Newsweek magazine. ;Liberty Forward Area Air Defense System: Developed in conjunction with LTV for the US Army's Line of Sight-Forward Heavy competition, the Liberty air defense system consisted of either 6 R460 SICA or 6 VT-1 missiles mounted on an M1A1 Abrams chassis along with a pair of 25mm cannonsArmor magazine, PB 17-96-6, dated November-December 1996 ‚Äî http://www.benning.army.mil/Armor/eARMOR/content/issues/1996/NOV_DEC/ArmorNovemberDecember1996web.pdf ;Crotale NG (VT-1) :An updated version, New Generation. Finland was the first operator of the system. The cost of the system is roughly 8 million euros (excluding the vehicle). Greece is another user, and paid 1 Billion French Francs in 1998 for 11 systems: 9 for the Hellenic Air Force and 2 for the Hellenic Navy. In 2002 euros, that would have amounted up to 12 million euros per unit. ;Crotale Mk.3 (system):In January 2008, France test-fired the new Crotale Mk.3 system at the CELM missile launch test center in Biscarrosse. The Crotale Mk.3 system's VT1 missile successfully intercepted a Banshee target drone at 970 metre altitude and 8 km range in 11 seconds on 15 January 2008. Later, on 31 January 2008, the system successfully intercepted another target drone at a 500-metre altitude and 15 km range in 35 seconds. == Operators == Map of Crotale operators in blue with former operators in red === Current operators === ; : Royal Bahraini Army ; : Egyptian Army (test in 1976) ; : The Finnish Army operates 21 Crotale NGs on Sisu XA-181 vehicles, designated ITO90M. ; : naval Crotale and land-based Crotale NG (12 systems) ; : Crotale NG, used by Hellenic Air Force (9 systems) and Hellenic Navy (2 naval systems). ; : Ya Zahra air defense system is an unlicensed Iranian-copy of an unlicensed Chinese-copy of Crotale missiles. ; : Crotale NG ; : Pakistan Air Force ; : K-SAM Pegasus (114 systems) ; : Shahine, Crotale ; ; : Royal Moroccan Army === Former operators === ; : Iraqi Air Force ; : First delivery in 1973. ; : Portuguese Army ; : delivered from 1971 to 1973 ; : Chilean Air Force == See also == * Roland missile (Franco-German surface-to-air missile) * LFK NG (the future surface-to-air missile of the German Army) == References == Category:Naval surface-to-air missiles of France Category:Surface-to-air missiles of France Category:Cold War military equipment of South Africa ","title":"Crotale (missile)"},{"id":"1427330","text":"Darryl Victor Talley (born July 10, 1960) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons during the 1980s and 1990s.

He started the season off with a win over Oklahoma and was named WVU's season MVP and was named All-American. He also played in the 1983 Hula Bowl. ===Legacy=== Talley's five tackles-for-a-loss against Penn State stand as a single-game record and his personal-best 15 tackles against Boston College won Sports Illustrated Player of the Week honors. For his career, he had 282 unassisted tackles (first all-time), 202 assisted tackles (second), 28 tackles-for-loss (second) and 19 sacks (fourth). During his four- year career, he recorded a school record of 484 career tackles; which has been passed by Grant Wiley. Talley was named to the 2008 College Football Hall of Fame ballot for nominees for induction, and was inducted in 20112008 College Football Hall of Fame ballot He is also a member of the West Virginia University Sports Hall of Fame. ==Professional career== Talley played in the National Football League for 14 seasons and played in four Super Bowls. He never missed a game in his 12-years with the Buffalo Bills. Jim Kelly, the Bills' Hall of Fame quarterback considers Talley his most underrated teammate and believes that Talley should also be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. ===Buffalo Bills=== Talley was selected in the second round of the 1983 NFL Draft by the Bills and played in Buffalo for 12 seasons. He is the Bills' all-time leading tackler with 1,137, and also recorded 38.5 sacks, 12 interceptions for 189 return yards and 3 touchdowns, and 14 fumble recoveries for 76 return yards. He averaged 120 tackles, 3.5 sacks and 6.2 takeaways per season and his mark of 188 regular season games played ranks fifth-most in team history. While with the Bills, Talley had multiple nicknames on the field as \\"The Duke of Awesome\\", \\"Spider-Man\\", and \\"The Hammer\\". His cheering section at Rich Stadium was known as the \\"Talley-Whackers\\". On November 4, 1990, playing against the Cleveland Browns in his hometown, Talley returned an interception for his first career touchdown. After the season, he received the Ed Block Courage Award. In 2003 Talley became the 20th member on the Wall of Fame in Ralph Wilson Stadium. ===Later career=== Talley left the Bills to play with the Falcons in the 1995 campaign and then with the Vikings. He left Atlanta on a less than stellar note when it was discovered that he played his last game in Atlanta with a loaded U-Haul truck in the parking lot. He had it so he could go home to spend the holiday with his family once the game was over. He ended his career after the 1996 season and won the Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. Distinguished Service Award in 2000. ==Personal life== On June 2, 2008 Talley commented that former Bills kicker Scott Norwood should be inducted onto the Bills' Wall of Fame. He stated; > \\"One thing I wish people would take a look at is out of all the things that > we accomplished we wouldn't have done a lot of them without Scott Norwood\\". > He continued on, \\"Everybody seems to have forgotten Scott. If you look back > in the early days we won a lot of games with special teams and him kicking > field goals.

He won All-Rookie Honors, after finding out a physical condition with his irregular heartbeat was not serious. In 1973 the Buffalo Bills rushing offense led the NFL in yards, yards per carry, as well as rushing touchdowns. He is also one of the first living NFL players to be tested and diagnosed with CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy). ==Playing career== DeLamielleure was perhaps the central figure in the \\"Electric Company,\\" the Bills' offensive line that paved the way for O. J. Simpson to rush for 2,003 yards in 1973, the first player ever to break that barrier, and the only player ever to do so in a 14-game schedule.Member profile The league leading rushing yardage mark of 3,088 yards is still the 14-game record. Only the 1978 New England Patriots have bettered that mark and did it in 16 games. Individually, Simpson led the NFL in all four major rushing categories. Joe also had the longest run in the NFL. The 2,003 yards Simpson rushed for is still the 14 game record (Eric Dickerson, Barry Sanders, Terrell Davis, Jamal Lewis, Chris Johnson and Adrian Peterson achieved their marks in 16 games). DeLamielleure was also on the kickoff return team that blocked for Wallace Francis, who led NFL with two return touchdowns. DeLamielleure played on the wedge of the kickoff return team his entire career in Buffalo. The following year, 1974, the Bills improved to 9‚Äì5 and made the playoffs. DeLamielleure was voted second-team All-Pro. In 1975 the Bills displayed one of the most potent offenses of the decade. They led the NFL in eleven categories, including total offense, rushing, rushing average, points, touchdowns and touchdown passes en route to an 8‚Äì6 record. The offensive line also allowed the fewest sacks in AFC. Simpson, behind the \\"Electric Company\\" achieved his second \\"quadruple crown\\" in three years and also had the longest run in NFL. Individually, DeLamielleure was named First-team All-Pro. *1976: Simpson again lead the NFL in rushing and DeLamielleure is named a First-team All-Pro. *1977: With Simpson injured at mid-season, the Bills pass more often, leading the NFL in passing yards and total passing attempts. *1978: With Simpson traded, Bills running back Terry Miller takes over and is 9th in the NFL in rushing. DeLamielleure was named an All-Pro six times and was named to the Pro Bowl six times. In 1975, DeLamielleure was named by the NFLPA as Offensive Lineman of the Year. In 1973, DeLamielleure was Co-Offensive Linemen of the Year as awarded by the 1000 Yard Rusher Club, Columbus, Ohio. In 1977, DeLamielleure received the Forrest Gregg Award as the NFL's Top Offensive Lineman for that season. In 1980, DeLamielleure was traded to the Cleveland Browns where he blocked for his 2nd NFL MVP, Brian Sipe. DeLamielleure became the first player ever to block for a 2,000 yard rusher and a 4,000 yard passer. Of those who have done it since, (Jackie Slater, Doug Smith, Irv Pankey, Kevin Glover, and Tom Nalen) only DeLamielleure's duo were NFL MVPs and the passer (Sipe) also won the NFL passing crown. Also, the 1980 Browns offensive line led NFL in allowing the lowest sacks percentage and blocked for a 1,000-yard runner (Mike Pruitt). During his five years with Cleveland, he played every game. In 1979, DeLamielleure was named to the NFL's All-Decade Team. He played his final year in the NFL, 1985, back with the Buffalo Bills.

DeLamielleure was a promoter of the All-American Football League, a spring league that hoped to fill a void of the now defunct NFL Europe. The AAFL planned to take collegiate players provided they've earned a four-year college degree. However, the league did not play a game. In 2009, DeLamielleure and his two former college teammates at Michigan State University embarked on a bicycle ride from East Lansing, Michigan to the site of \\"The City of the Children\\" orphanage in Mexico.

It is on the River Coln, a Thames tributary that rises in the same (Cotswold) District. The village centre is northeast of Cirencester. Arlington Row is a nationally notable architectural conservation area depicted on the inside cover of all British passports. It is a major destination for tourists visiting the traditional rural villages, tea houses and many historic buildings of the Cotswold District; it is one of six places in the country featured in Mini- Europe, Brussels. ==History== St Mary's Church, Bibury In the Domesday Book (1086), a record of survey done under William the Conqueror, the place is named Becheberie, and it is recorded that the lands and church in Bibury were held by St. Mary's Priory at Worcester, from whom it passed in 1130 to the Abbey of Osney, near Oxford: the Abbey continued to hold it until its dissolution in 1540. The Church of England Church of St Mary is very late Saxon with later additions and listed in the top of the three heritage/architecture categories, Grade I. Its main material is random (cobblestone) and coursed rubble limestone with a slate roof. It is formed of a nave with north and south aisles, south porch, north west tower and chancel, tower, arched doorways. The churchyard has been described as being \\"of special interest because of the remarkable survival of so many excellently carved table tombs with bale tops, and headstones with cherubs and symbolic figures of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\\". There is an early canonical sundial on the south wall. From AD 1130 until the English Reformation during the 16th century, the church was a peculier of Osney Abbey in Oxford. Adjacent to the church is the village primary school that was built in the 1850s. In 2015 the school had 43 pupils on its roll in two classes. On the Arlington (west) side of the village is Arlington Baptist Church, where a congregation has been meeting since the 1740s. Late in the 19th century George Witts recounted the discovery of the Bibury Roman villa: \\"In the year 1880 a Roman villa was accidentally discovered in the parish of Bibury, about six miles northeast of Cirencester. Some Roman pottery, coins, remnants of tesselated pavements, &c.;, were found, but as no examination has yet taken place, no description of the building can be given.\\"‚ÄîGeorge Witts, 1883. The site fills a small low meander downstream of the bridge on the Arlington, Bibury side.Scheduled Ancient Monument official listing. Bibury village proper, on the east bank, consists of approximately 40 homes and businesses, of which two are prominent hotels. ==Visitor attractions== Arlington Mill in Bibury in 2009 The 19th-century artist and craftsman William Morris called Bibury \\"the most beautiful village in England\\" when he visited it. The village is known for its honey-coloured 17th-century stone cottages with steeply pitched roofs, which once housed weavers who supplied cloth for fulling at nearby Arlington Mill. Until the 1980s, that building also housed the museum of Arlington Mill with a collection of period clothing, before it was shifted to Barnsley House. The Mill is now a private residence. The place where the wool was hung to dry after being washed in Arlington Row, was known as \\"Rack Isle\\". Today, this water meadow and marshy area, which is seasonally flooded and surrounded by water from three sides, is an important habitat for water-loving plants and birds including mallards, coots, and moorhens; it is also a National Trust Wildfowl Reserve. Bibury is particularly frequented by Japanese tourists. This is largely attributed to Emperor Hirohito having stayed in the village on his European tour.http://biburyshop.blogspot.co.uk/2010/05/japanese-and- english.html The largest building in Bibury is Bibury Court, built in 1633 in the Jacobean style. It is a Grade I listed building, and was recently a hotel. The hotel has now closed permanently with its future unknown. Previously it was inhabited by Lord Sherborne when in 2008 it was bought by John Lister, of Shipton Mill organic flour. The village has a tennis court downstream of where the main road turns away to the north-west, close to the church and Bibury Court. Ablington Manor, on Potlicker's Lane, was built in 1590, and is also a Grade I listed building. ===Arlington Row=== The picturesque Arlington Row cottages were built in 1380 as a monastic wool store. This was converted into a row of cottages for weavers in the 17th century. The cloth produced there was sent to Arlington Mill. Arlington Row is a popular visitor attraction, probably one of the most photographed Cotswold scenes, and was preserved by the Royal College of Arts. It has been used as a film and television location, most notably for the films Stardust and Bridget Jones's Diary.IMDB Website In 2017 the BBC reported that an \\"ugly\\" car parked by an elderly motorist had been vandalised, possibly by visitors who had repeatedly complained that it spoilt photographs. ==Geography== Grade II listed buildings in Bibury along the River Coln The Coln, a tributary of the Thames, flows in a very steep valley (in Thames Basin terms) southeastwards. It flows alongside the midsection of Bibury with Arlington's main street which doglegs to achieve this. Each side has a similar concentration and scale of development; each bank's development falls mainly in the Bibury conservation area which has an insightful district surveyor's statement for building owners and visitors.Documents related to Bibury Conservation Area Retrieved 27 January 2015 The parish is approximately rectangular and stretches far to the rolling, elevated, north. It includes on outlying settlement, Ablington, in the upper valley. Bibury Farm is from the village, above Ordnance Datum (AOD), which is a similar elevation to much of the north. The south rises to a maximum of on its periphery along Akeman Street, a Roman road, before ascending further in other more distant lands. The valley floor within the Bibury boundary, northwest and southeast, ranges from AOD. The Coln, along with the Bibury Spring, supplies Bibury Trout farm, founded in 1902 by the naturalist Arthur Severn, to stock the local rivers and streams with the native brown trout. The hatchery spawns up to six million trout ova every year. Three medieval clusters are all interspersed by substantial grass, making for a dense developed area compared to suburbs but not in terms of roads; a footbridge connects both sides (Arlington and Bibury) as well as various footpaths in all directions. Elevations vary widely even throughout the village parts, with the gentlest slope in the eastern escarpment of the Cotswold Hills for a mile or more in each direction taken by the main village road. ==Culture== The world's first horse racing club, The Bibury Club, was formed in 1681 and held race meetings on Macaroni Downs above the village until the early 20th century. ==Notable inhabitants== In 2000, Daniel Brennan KCSG, QC, barrister and judge, was made Lord Brennan and Bibury is his territorial designation as his home village. ==See also== * Grade I listed buildings in Gloucestershire * List of Roman villas in Gloucestershire ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== * *www.geograph.co.uk : photos of Bibury and surrounding area *BBC archive film of Bibury from 1986 *Bibury Primary School Website *Bibury Baptist Church Website *Bibury website *Bibury village Website *Storybook Small Towns in the United Kingdom Category:Cotswold District Category:Villages in Gloucestershire Category:Tourist attractions in Gloucestershire ","title":"Bibury"},{"id":"1427387","text":"Paynes Find is a former gold rush settlement approximately northeast of Perth in the Mid West region of Western Australia.

He served as the 69th Governor of Maine from 1975 to 1979, and was the first Independent to hold the office. In 1949, he married the former Helen Angela Walsh, who died on September 13, 2005. They had five children, including former Republican U.S. Representative James B. Longley Jr. (born 1951). Longley Sr., a graduate of Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, resided in Lewiston and Auburn, Maine. The owner of a successful insurance agency in Lewiston, Longley got his first opportunity in statewide politics when then- Governor Kenneth M. Curtis asked him to lead a state government commission called The Maine Management and Cost Survey Commission, which was intended to make government more efficient, and cut costs. After some initial reluctance, Longley accepted the position and pursued the job with vigor. Longley made several recommendations that were projected to save the state in excess of $24 million. One of his major proposals included restructuring the Maine university system, which he felt was grossly inefficient. His work at the commission gave him a prominent statewide profile, something he decided to try to turn into an electoral mandate when Governor Curtis retired in 1974. Longley had been a lifelong Democrat, but due to earning a maverick reputation acting in a non-partisan role on the cost-cutting commission and because he inadvertently missed the filing deadline for party candidates in the 1974 Maine gubernatorial election, he ran as an independent. Some Maine observers believed he knew he would be unable to beat both former Edmund Muskie adviser George J. Mitchell and state Senator Joseph E. Brennan in a Democratic primary, causing him not to file with the party. He ran on the slogan \\"Think About It,\\" a phrase he often used with insurance customers to get them to consider his products. He had been endorsed by the Bangor Daily News. As Governor, Longley issued 118 vetoes, a record that stood until Paul LePage vetoed 624 bills. Longley holds the record for having the most vetoes overridden by the Legislature in a single term (64). Longley is still notable in Maine politics for having a reputation for making off-the-cuff abrasive comments. He once referred to state legislators as \\"pimps\\". Other Maine governors who are seen as having a similar style are sometimes compared to Longley, such as LePage. Longley promised during his campaign that he would serve only one term, and he did not run for re-election in 1978. Longley died of cancer on August 16, 1980, and was interred at Mount Hope Cemetery in Lewiston. ==References== Category:1924 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Bowdoin College alumni Category:Governors of Maine Category:Maine Independents Category:Independent state governors of the United States Category:Politicians from Lewiston, Maine Category:Politicians from Auburn, Maine Category:20th-century American politicians ","title":"James B.

It was founded in the town of Mondragon in 1956 by graduates of a local technical college. Its first product was paraffin heaters. It is the tenth-largest Spanish company in terms of asset turnover and the leading business group in the Basque Country. At the end of 2014, it employed 74,117 people in 257 companies and organizations in four areas of activity: finance, industry, retail and knowledge. By 2019 81,507 people were employed. Mondragon cooperatives operate in accordance with the Statement on the Co-operative Identity maintained by the International Co- operative Alliance. ==History== In 1941, a young Catholic priest, Jos√© Mar√≠a Arizmendiarrieta settled in Mondrag√≥n, a town with a population of 7,000 that had not yet recovered from the poverty, hunger, exile, and tension of the Spanish Civil War.The Mondrag√≥n Experiment - Corporate Cooperativism (1980) FULL You Tube In 1943, Arizmendiarrieta established a technical college which became a training ground for managers, engineers and skilled labour for local companies, and primarily for the co-operatives. Arizmendiarrieta spent a number of years educating young people about a form of humanism based on solidarity and participation, in harmony with Catholic social teaching, and the importance of acquiring the necessary technical knowledge before creating the first co-operative. In 1955, he selected five young people to set up the first company of the co-operative and industrial beginning of the Mondragon Corporation. The company was called Talleres Ulgor, an acronym derived from the surnames of Usatorre, Larra√±aga, Gorro√±ogoitia, Ormaechea, and Ortubay, known today as \\"Fagor Electrodom√©sticos\\". In the first 15 years many co- operatives were established, thanks to the autarky of the market and the awakening of the Spanish economy. During these years, also with the encouragement of Don Jos√© Mar√≠a Arizmendiarrieta, the Caja Laboral (1959) and the Social Welfare Body Lagun Aro (1966) were set up that were to play a key role. The first local group was created, Ularco. In 1969, Eroski was founded by merging ten small local consumer co-operatives.Conosce Eroski una empresa diferente Eroski During the next 20 years, from 1970 to 1990, the dynamic continued, with a strong increase in new co-operatives promoted by Caja Laboral's Business Division, the promotion of co-operative associations, the formation of local groups, and the founding of the Ikerlan Research Centre in 1974.http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/76338 euskomedia.org With Spain scheduled to join the European Economic Community in 1986, it was decided in 1984 to set up the \\"Mondragon Co-operative Group\\", the forerunner of the current corporation. In-service training for managers was strengthened by creating Otalora, dedicated to training, and the dissemination of co- operatives. The Group consisted of 23,130 workers at the end of 1990. On the international stage, the aim was to respond to growing globalisation, expanding abroad by setting up production plants in a number of countries. The first was the Copreci plant in Mexico in 1990, followed by many others: up to 73 by the end of 2008, and 122 at the end of 2013. The goals were to increase competitiveness and market share, bring component supply closer to customers' plants, especially in the automotive and domestic appliance sectors, and to strengthen employment in the Basque Country by promoting exports of co- operatives' products by means of new platforms.

The culture is rooted in a shared mission and a number of principles, corporate values and business policies. Over the years, these links have been embodied in a series of operating rules approved on a majority basis by the Co-operative Congresses, which regulate the activity of the Governing Bodies of the corporation (Standing Committee, General Council), the Grassroots Co- operatives and the Divisions they belong to, from the organisational, institutional and economic points of view as well as in terms of assets. This framework of business culture has been structured based on a common culture derived from the 10 Basic Co-operative Principles, in which Mondragon is rooted: Open Admission, Democratic Organisation, the Sovereignty of Labour, Instrumental and Subordinate Nature of Capital, Participatory Management, Payment Solidarity, Inter-cooperation, Social Transformation, Universality and Education. This philosophy is complemented by four corporate values: Co- operation, acting as owners and protagonists; Participation, which takes shape as a commitment to management; Social Responsibility, by means of the distribution of wealth based on solidarity; and Innovation, focusing on constant renewal in all areas. This business culture translates into compliance with a number of Basic Objectives (Customer Focus, Development, Innovation, Profitability, People in Co-operation and Involvement in the Community) and General Policies approved by the Co-operative Congress, which are taken on board at all the corporation's organisational levels and incorporated into the four-year strategic plans and the annual business plans of the individual co-operatives, divisions, and the corporation as a whole. ===Wage regulation=== At Mondragon, there are agreed-upon wage ratios between executive work and field or factory work which earns a minimum wage. These ratios range from 3:1 to 9:1 in different cooperatives and average 5:1. That is, the general manager of an average Mondragon cooperative earns no more than 5 times as much as the theoretical minimum wage paid in their cooperative. For most workers, this ratio is smaller because there are few Mondragon worker- owners that earn minimum wages, because most jobs are somewhat specialized and are classified at higher wage levels. The wage ratio of a cooperative is decided periodically by its worker-owners through a democratic vote. Compared to similar jobs at local industries, Mondragon managers' wages are considerably lower (as some companies pay their best paid managers hundreds of times more than the lowest-paid employee of the company)Vincent Navarro, What About Cooperatives as a Solution? The Case of Mondragon, CounterPunch, 2014.04.30 and equivalent for middle management, technical and professional levels. Lower wage levels are on average 13% higher than similar jobs at local businesses. Spain's progressive tax rate further reduces any disparity in pay. These low wages make it very difficult to recruit managers from investor-owned firms. ==Business sectors== Mondragon Corporation operates in four areas: finance, industry, retail, and knowledge, with the latter distinguishing Mondragon from other business groups. In 2013, the corporation posted a total revenue of over ‚Ç¨12 billion (roughly US$16 billion), and employed 74,061 workers, making it Spain's fourth-largest industrial and tenth-largest financial group. ===Finance=== This area includes the banking business of Laboral Kutxa, the insurance company Seguros Lagun Aro, and the Voluntary Social Welfare Body Lagun Aro, which had an asset fund totalling ‚Ç¨5,566 million at the end of 2014. The yield obtained from this fund is used to cover long-term retirement, widowhood, and invalidity benefits, complementary to those offered by the Spanish social security system. ===Industry=== The corporation's companies manufacture consumer goods, capital goods, industrial components, products, and systems for construction, and services. The latter includes very diverse business groups such as Abantail: Adaptive design optimization, Alecop: Engineering training, LKS Consultores: Attorbeys etc., LKS Ingenier√≠a: Architects and engineers. MCCTelecom: Telecommunication engineering. Mondragon Lingua: Translation and language schools, Mondragon Sistemas: Automation, Industrial Computing and Telecommunications. Ondoan: Turnkey projects in the energy and environmental sector.

Mondragon also participated in 91 international R&D; projects.Tu Lankide,\\"Internationalisation consolidates Mondragon‚Äôs industrial business with sales abroad in excess of ‚Ç¨4bn\\", 17 June 2013. In 2014, the industrial cooperatives created 1,000 jobs, and internationalization continued with 125 production subsidiaries abroad - 3 more than the year before.Tu Lankide MONDRAGON cooperatives in industrial sector create 1.000 jobs in 2014 14 July 2015 ===Retail=== Mondragon runs Eroski, one of the leading retail groups all over Spain and in southern France, and maintains close contacts with the French group Les Mousquetaires and the German retailer Edeka, with whom it set up the Alidis international purchasing group in 2002. The worker-owners and consumer-members participate in the co-operative's decision-making bodies and management of Eroski. At the end of 2013, Eroski posted a turnover of ‚Ç¨6.6 billion, operating 2.069 stores made up of 90 Eroski hypermarkets, 1,211 Eroski/center, Caprabo, Eroski/city, Aliprox, Familia, Onda and Cash & Carry supermarkets, 155 branches of Eroski travel agencies, 63 petrol stations, 39 Forum Sport stores and 221 IF perfume stores.Datos destacados de 2014 Eroski In southern France Eroski had 4 hypermarkets, 16 supermarkets and 17 petrol stations, and 4 perfume stores in Andorra. Retail includes the food group Erkop, for catering, cleaning, stock- breeding, and horticulture with Auzo Lagun, a co-operative in group catering and cleaning of buildings and premises, and integrated service in the health sector. In 2008, worker-members voted to expand the cooperative transformation to the retail group as a whole, turning subsidiaries into co-operatives, and making salaried workers worker-members. This process was to be carried out over a number of years. ===Knowledge=== This area has a dual focus: education- training and innovation, which have both been key elements in the development of the corporation. Training-education is mainly linked to the dynamism of Mondragon University, the significant role that Politeknika Ikastegia Txorierri, Arizmendi Ikastola and Lea Artibai Ikastetxea play in their respective areas and the activity of the Management and Co-operative Development Centre Otalora. Mondragon University is a co-operative university, which combines the development of knowledge, skills, and values, and maintains close relations with business, especially Mondragon co-operatives. Technological innovation is generated through the co-operatives' own R&D; departments, the Corporate Science and Technology Plan, the corporation's 12 technology centers and the Garaia Innovation Park. The 15 technology centers play a fundamental role in the development of the sectors of focus. In 2009 they employed 742 people and had a budget of ‚Ç¨53.7 million. In 2013 its network of technology centers and R&D; units provided employment for 1,700 people and the commitment to R&D;&I; matters amounted to 136 million Euros, 8.5% of added value. Mondragon has 479 families of Patents for Inventions, which accounts for 25% patents in the Basque Country, participating in more than 30 R&D; cooperation projects at the European level. ==Reactions== In 2012 Richard D. Wolff, an American professor of economics, hailed the Mondragon set of enterprises, including the good wages it provides for employees, the empowerment of ordinary workers in decision making, and the measure of equality for female workers, as a major success and cited it as a working model of an alternative to the capitalist mode of production.Wolff, Richard (24 June 2012). Yes, there is an alternative to capitalism: Mondragon shows the way. The Guardian. In an April 2012 interview Noam Chomsky said that while Mondragon offers an alternative to capitalism, it was still embedded in a capitalist system which limits Mondragon's decisions:Talking With Chomsky, Laura Flanders, 30 April 2012 CounterPunch. Vincent Navarro wrote that from a business perspective, Mondragon is successful in matching efficiency with solidarity and democracy. However, he writes that the number of employees who are not owners has increased more rapidly than worker-owners, to a point that in some companies, for example in the supermarket chains owned by Mondragon, the first is a much larger group than the second. In Navarro's view, this establishes a two-tier system - for example, in terms of whom to save in the case the company collapses. In the collapse of Fagor, the relocation of employees to other companies belonging to Mondragon favored those who were worker-owners, which may affect labor relations: The Mondragon system is one of four case studies analyzed in Capital and the Debt Trap, which summarized evidence claiming that cooperatives tend to last longer and are less susceptible to perverse incentives and other problems of organizational governance than more traditionally managed organizations. The founders of Cooperation Jackson, a network of worker cooperatives in Jackson, Mississippi in the United States, cite Mondragon as a key inspiration. == Mondragon in fiction == In 2312, a science fiction novel by Kim Stanley Robinson, the Mondragon Corporation has evolved into a planned economy system called the Mondragon Accord.http://kimstanleyrobinson.info/node/445 The Mondragon Accord is controlled by means of a network of AIs running on quantum computers, and rules large parts of the Solar System, including Mercury and most of the moons of the gas giants; only part of Earth, and its colonies in space, retain remnants of capitalist economies, while Mars has withdrawn from the Accord in the century preceding the story. The Mondragon Corporation already appeared in Robinson's earlier Mars trilogy, as one of the Terran groups involved in the colonization and terraforming of Mars; the coop is also portrayed as the inspiration of both the bogdanovist movementhttp://kimstanleyrobinson.info/content/mars-trilogy-groups and the libertarian-leaning Praxis Corporationhttps://claecceity.wordpress.com/2015/03/04/a-rebuke-by-vlad- taneev-from-kim-stanley-robinsons-blue-mars/ two of the main forces leading the revolution for the independence of Mars. == See also == * Cecosesola, association of cooperatives in Venezuela * Distributism * Horizontalidad * John Lewis Partnership * List of worker cooperatives * Workers' self- management ==References== ==Further reading== * Azurmendi, Joxe 1984: El hombre cooperativo *Spanish white goods company Fagor seeks protection from creditors (October 2013) * Thousands of Fagor employees demand in Mondragon town to keep their jobs (October 2013) * White-goods giant Fagor goes into administration (October 2013) *Cooperation for Economic Success.

Health care in Ireland is two-tier: public and private sectors exist. The public health care system is governed by the Health Act 2004, which established a new body to be responsible for providing health and personal social services to everyone living in Ireland ‚Äì the Health Service Executive. The new national health service came into being officially on 1 January 2005; however the new structures are currently in the process of being established as the reform programme continues. In addition to the public-sector, there is also a large private healthcare market. In 2010 Ireland spent ‚Ç¨2,862 per capita on health, compared to a European Union average of ‚Ç¨2,172 per capita, of this spending approximately 79% was government expenditure. In 2017 spending was the seventh highest in the OECD: $5,500 per head. Overcrowding has been an issue at hospitals in Ireland, with over 118,000 patients having to wait for a bed in 2019. ==Health care system== Total health spending as a percentage of GDP for Ireland compared amongst various other first world nations from 2005 to 2008 All persons resident in Ireland are entitled to receive health care through the public health care system, which is managed by the Health Service Executive and funded by general taxation and subsidised fees for service. All maternity services and child care up to the age of six years are provided free of charge. Emergency care is provided at a cost of ‚Ç¨100 for a visit to the Accident and Emergency (A&E;) department, if one has not attended a GP first. The Medical Card ‚Äì which entitles holders to free hospital care, GP visits, dental services, optical services, aural services, prescription drugs and medical appliances ‚Äì is available to those receiving welfare payments, low earners, many retirees, and in certain other cases. The only medical conditions carrying automatic entitlement to a card are having thalidomide syndrome, having a surgical symphysiotomy, and children with cancer. Many political parties support extending the availability of the Medical Card to eventually cover every resident in Ireland ‚Äì they currently cover 31.9% of the population. Those on slightly higher incomes are eligible for a 'GP Visit Card' which entitles the holder to free general practitioner visits. Persons over 70 years who are not entitled to a medical GP visit card can instead receive an annual cash grant of ‚Ç¨400 up to a certain income. People who are not entitled to a Medical Card (i.e. 68.1% of the population) must pay fees for certain health care services. There is a ‚Ç¨100 A&E; charge for those who attend an accident and emergency department without a referral letter from a family doctor (a visit to which usually costs ‚Ç¨45‚Äì75, though some practices offer rates as low as ‚Ç¨25-35 for over-65s and students). Hospital charges (for inpatients) are a flat fee of ‚Ç¨80 per day up to a maximum of ‚Ç¨800 in any twelve-month period, irrespective of the actual care received. Specialist assessments and diagnostic assessments (such as X-rays, laboratory tests, physiotherapy, etc.) are provided free of charge. If a person cannot afford to pay hospital charges, the HSE will provide the services free of charge. Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, prescription drugs, individuals and families are eligible for subsidies for approved prescription drugs, medicines, and certain appliances, and pay only a maximum of ‚Ç¨124 per month per household. To qualify a patient must hold a Drugs Payment Scheme Card, for which everyone who does not hold a Medical Card is eligible. Everyone living in the country, and visitors to Ireland who hold a European Health Insurance Card, are entitled to use the public healthcare system. Under Common Travel Area (CTA) arrangements, British citizens do not require an EHIC card and can instead present their NHS number, NHS card, driving licence or other proof of residence within the CTA. Outpatient services are also provided without charge. The majority of patients on median incomes or above are required to pay subsidised hospital charges. ===Hospitals=== The Rotunda Hospital in Dublin is the world's oldest maternity hospital, founded in 1745. It is also one of its largest, dealing with over eight thousand births in 2007. Hospitals in Ireland generally offer a full range of healthcare including accident and emergency services. Many hospitals in Ireland, such as Connolly Hospital at Blanchardstown, are operated directly by the Health Service Executive. There are also hospitals run on a voluntary basis by organisations who receive public funding but operate with some degree of autonomy. Included in this latter group are teaching hospitals (such as University Hospital Galway) operated in conjunction with a university and hospitals with a long-standing religious ethos e.g. Tallaght University Hospital in Dublin. There are also many private hospitals. Ireland has a lower than OECD-average number of hospital beds according to the 2013 OECD Health at a Glance Report The same report also noted that Ireland has fewer doctors (2.7 doctors per 1,000 population) and more nurses (12.2 nurses per 1,000 population) than average in other OECD countries. Consultants in the publicly funded hospitals are allowed to spend some of their time (typically 20%, though there is little supervision) on private practice. ====Waiting lists==== Ireland has reduced its spending on health care by 6.6% since the onset of the Global Financial Crisis according to the OECD's 2013 Health Report. In consequence, waiting times for treatment have increased. According to the Euro health consumer index waiting times for emergency treatment, minor operations, and CT scans, in Irish hospitals in 2015 were the worst in Europe, though the Irish health system was ranked 21st out of 35 European countries. The Health Service Executive accepted that it lacked the capacity to provide sufficiently accessible health services. It was working to ensure that no one had to wait more than 18 months for an outpatient appointment, or inpatient treatment. According to the index, reports by patients on waiting times were considerably more pessimistic than official Irish waiting-time statistics. The Euro health consumer index 2018 report continues to rank the accessibility of Ireland's Health system as the worst in Europe, with the overall ranking as 22nd of 35. In 2007, 76% of inpatients were admitted to hospital for operations immediately, 11% had to wait up to one month, 4% had to wait up to three months, 1% had to wait up to six months and 4% had to wait for over six months for operations. Waiting times at the National Rehabilitation Hospital, the only such facility in the country, can be one year. For outpatients, 23% were seen on time, 44% were seen within 30 minutes, 18% waited more than an hour and 7% waited two hours. University Hospital Galway is one of Ireland's largest hospitals, dealing with over two hundred thousand patients in 2007. In 2007, for GP services, 31% were seen without an appointment, 38% received an appointment the same day, 28% received a next day appointment and 3% had to wait over two days to be seen. The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) was set up in 2002 for those waiting over three months for an operation or procedure, and as a result over 135,000 patients on waiting lists have been treated so far. The NTPF involves the government paying for public patients to be treated for free in a private hospital in Ireland, or sometimes abroad if necessary. The NTPF has reduced waiting times for procedures to an average of between two and five months (the average in 2009 is 2.4 months), compared to between two and five years in 2002. There are cases where essential care is needed urgently but not made available by the HSE under their NTPF, and contrary to relevant judgements by the European Court of Justice. HSE figures quoted in April 2012 show that at least 178,000 people in Ireland were on waiting lists to see specialists at an outpatient clinic, and that more than 300 patients had been waiting for over four years to be seen by a consultant after being referred by their GP. ===Health centres=== A BreastCheck centre in Galway. Health centres provide a wide range of primary care and community services in towns and villages throughout Ireland, and are run by the HSE. Services available at these clinics include GP services, public health nurses, social work and child protection services, child health services, community welfare, disability services, older people services, chiropody, ophthalmic, speech therapy, addiction counselling and treatment, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, psychiatric services, and Home Help. These services are available for free, or at a subsidised rate. In 2012 a programme of developing 35 primary care centres was announced. By July 2017 only one was operational. 14 are to be constructed by public-private partnerships. ====General practitioners==== Primary health care in Ireland is mostly provided by general practitioners (GPs), who generally operate as sole traders or in health centres with other GPs and sometimes nurses. Most GPs also offer house visits to their patients, with emergency \\"out-of-hours\\" GP services available in all parts of the country. GPs generally charge on a per-consultation fee basis, usually charging anything up to ‚Ç¨65, depending on the region. People with Medical Cards or GP Visit Cards are exempt from charges. About 60% of the population have to pay up-front in cash. Many GPs provide free services to those with hepatitis C and maternity and infant services. Those with private health insurance can, depending on their plan, have their GP costs paid or refunded, either fully or partially, by the insurance company. People can also claim tax relief for GP visit costs. ===Drugs=== Prescription drugs and medical appliances are available to all for a small fee (medical card holders), reduced cost (Drugs Payment Scheme) or in certain circumstances free (under the Long Term Illness Scheme) to residents of Ireland. The Drugs Payment Scheme ensures that every household has to pay no more than ‚Ç¨124 per calendar month for a month's supply of prescribed medicines and medical appliances, to be cut to ‚Ç¨114 from April 2020. Some private health insurance plans provide partial reimbursement up to the Drugs Payment Scheme threshold. Those who are entitled to a medical card pay a government levy for each item dispensed. The levy is ‚Ç¨2.00 up to a maximum of ‚Ç¨20 per family per calendar month. Those who are suffering from one of a list of 16 long-term illnesses do not have to pay for medicines or medical appliances related to their conditions. Ireland has below-average use of generic medication according to the OECD, despite being a major exporter. The levy was reduced to ‚Ç¨1.50 from April 2019 for medical card holders over the age of 70, and will be further cut to ‚Ç¨1 from April 2020. All immunisation vaccines for children are provided free of charge, in schools, health clinics and hospitals. Recovering heroin addicts can receive methadone treatment free of charge under the Methadone Treatment Scheme. ===Other services=== The HSE provide dental, optical (vision) and aural (hearing) health care. Medical Card holders and their dependents, Health Amendment Act Card holders and children get these services free. Other people can get these services free or at a reduced cost from the Treatment Benefit Scheme or private insurance. People who pay the full price to private practitioners can claim tax relief. The HSE also provide mental health services, and treatment and rehabilitation services for alcohol and drug addicts. The Irish healthcare system is often criticized for not providing sufficient services for those with mental health issues, leading to a rapidly growing suicide rate, and ineffective services delivered to young people. ===Payment schemes=== Those and their dependants without a Medical Card or private health insurance can receive medical services free or at a subsidised rate from the Treatment Benefit Scheme, which takes into account the compulsory Social Insurance Fund (PRSI) contributions they have made. People can also claim tax relief on medical expenses not covered by the State or by private health insurance. Those with private health insurance are provided with tax credits, which are passed directly to the insurance company and lower the customer's premium. Visitors to Ireland who hold a European Health Insurance Card do not have to pay for emergency treatment from a general practitioner or specialist, emergency dental, oral or aural treatment, inpatient or outpatient hospital treatment or prescription medicines. Those who need dialysis, oxygen therapy or other specialised treatments can arrange for them before their visit. ===Satisfaction with the health service=== A survey, commissioned by the HSE in 2007, found that patient satisfaction with the health service was quite high, with 90% of inpatients and 85% of outpatients saying they were satisfied with their treatment. In addition to this, 97% said they were satisfied with the care provided by their GP. The 2008 Health Consumer Powerhouse Euro Health Consumer Index report ranked Ireland's public healthcare system 11th out of 31 European countries. This is an improvement on the 2007 report which ranked Ireland 16th out of 29 countries, and a drastic improvement on the 2006 report, in which Ireland was ranked 26th out of 26 countries. ==Health Service Executive== The Health Service Executive (HSE) manages the delivery of the entire health service as a single national entity. There are four HSE administrative areas (HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster, HSE Dublin North-East, HSE South and HSE West), which are in turn divided into 32 Local Health Offices (LHOs). It is Ireland's largest employer with over 100,000 workers; and has an annual budget of ‚Ç¨16 billion, more than any other public sector organisation. ==Minister for Health== The Minister for Health has responsibility for setting overall policy with regard to the health service. ==Private health insurance== Private health insurance is available to the population for those who want it. Vhi Healthcare (which is part-owned by the government), Laya Healthcare, and Aviva provide health insurance, among other services. Quote Devil were set up in 2006 to provide health insurance amongst other insurance types. On 2 July 2012, GloHealth entered the market to become Ireland's fourth private health insurer. In 2005, 47.6% of people were covered by private health insurance. The regulatory body for private health insurance is the Health Insurance Authority. In 2015 the proportion of people buying private health insurance had fallen to 40%, but this is still the highest proportion of any European country. The average annual cost of basic health insurance was ‚Ç¨1,850 in 2017. Only 13% of the total Irish expenditure on healthcare was attributed to private insurance. ==History and reform== No√´l Browne attempted to introduce free state-funded healthcare for all mothers and children aged under 16 in 1948, but was defeated by Irish Medical Organization and the church, which objected to the expansion of \\"socialized medicine\\", so healthcare continued to be delivered by family doctors and in religious and charitable hospitals. The state concentrated on public health measures, and built hospitals which were still run by the church. Private hospitals benefit from tax reliefs and this has encouraged private for-profit operators into the system. The Voluntary Health Insurance Board was established in 1957. It is still a state-owned corporation which undermines the idea of a universal, single-tier public health service as laid out in the Sustainable Development Goals to which the government is committed or Sl√°intecare as advocated by the Social Democrats. The British NHS is said to outperform services in Ireland on key performance indicators. ==See also== * Health care system * Health in Ireland * Maev-Ann Wren, analyst and critic of Irish healthcare provision * Mental health in Ireland ==References== ==External links== *Health Service Executive *Department of Health *Citizens Information ‚Äì Health *Health Insurance Authority *European Health Insurance Card ‚Äì Ireland *Health Information and Quality Authority *Private Homecare Service provider throughout Dublin *HomeCarer Private Homecare Service provider throughout Dublin ","title":"Healthcare in the Republic of Ireland"},{"id":"1427441","text":" USS Wedderburn (DD-684), a Fletcher-class destroyer, was a ship of the United States Navy named for lieutenant (j.g.) Charles F. Wedderburn, a destroyerman who was killed during World War I. Wedderburn (DD-684) was laid down on 10 January 1943 at San Francisco by the Bethlehem Steel Co.; launched on 1 August 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Gertrude F. Wedderburn; and commissioned on 9 March 1944, Commander John L. Wilfong in command. == 1944 == Following shakedown training along the west coast and post-shakedown availability back at the Bethlehem Steel Co., Wedderburn departed San Francisco on 21 June in company with Fieberling (DE-640). The two warships arrived in Pearl Harbor six days later, and Wedderburn joined Task Unit (TU) 19.3.2 with which she served briefly on plane guard and anti-submarine duty. On 1 July, the destroyer continued her voyage west to Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands where she joined Task Force (TF) 53 for the second assault of the Marianas operation, the battle of Guam. She stood out of Eniwetok on 17 July in company with Task Group (TG) 53.4, the Southern Transport Group. She arrived off Guam on 22 July, the day after the initial assault on that island and, for the next three weeks, performed yeoman service protecting the invasion fleet--upon which the battle ashore depended--from the threat of Japanese submarine attack. Her service in the Marianas ended on 10 August when she shaped a course back to Eniwetok. Wedderburn reentered the lagoon at Eniwetok on 14 August. There, she was reassigned to the antisubmarine screen of a fast carrier task group, TG 38.2, built around Intrepid (CV-11), Hancock (CV-19), Bunker Hill (CV-17), Cabot (CVL-28), and Independence (CVL-22). She sailed from Eniwetok on 29 August in company with the entire fast carrier task force (TF 38) to conduct a major sweep of Japanese-held islands including the Philippines, the Palaus, and Yap Island. Wedderburn screened the carrier from enemy submarine attacks while they sent their planes against targets on Mindanao and Leyte and, later, the Visayas sub-group. They also provided initial aerial bombardment for the Palau invasion and for the Morotai operation. Those missions took up almost the entire month of September, and the destroyer did not enter a \\"port\\" until the 28th when TG 38.2 arrived at Saipan. On 1 October, she and TG 38.2 moved on to recently captured Ulithi where the ships arrived the next day. Wedderburn, however, soon returned to sea. Task Force 38 rendezvoused about 375 miles west of the Marianas on 7 October to open the preliminaries to the invasion of Leyte. Wedderburn continued her antisubmarine vigil while the carriers she protected launched their aircraft first against Okinawa, then Formosa, and finally Philippine targets, striking enemy air bases on Luzon and the Visayas to give the United States dominance in the air over Leyte when the invasion began on 20 October. Wedderburn continued to guard the fast carriers while they operated off the northeastern shore of Luzon providing distant air support for the Leyte invasion. By the 24th, it had become apparent that the Japanese planned to dispute the landing with some variety of naval force. The result was the four-phase Battle for Leyte Gulf. That same day, planes from Wedderburn-protected carriers opened the battle striking at the enemy's Center Force, commanded by Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita--while it traversed the Sibuyan Sea toward the San Bernardino Strait. Late that evening, after having sunk battleship Musashi and damaged other Japanese ships, the fast carriers raced northward to take the bait offered by a force of almost plane-less aircraft carriers which Vice Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa was using as a decoy force. Thus, Wedderburn was far north when the Surigao Strait and Samar phases were fought on the night of 24-25 October and the morning of the 25th, respectively. Instead, she participated in the final phase of the battle, against Ozawa's force, though her role remained one of support for the carriers which she screened against submarine attack while she rescued their downed aviators. After the Battle for Leyte Gulf, the destroyer continued to operate off Luzon with TG 38.2 while the carriers' planes provided additional air cover for the troops fighting to capture Leyte. That duty lasted until 5 November when engine trouble forced her to set a course for Ulithi. The warship arrived at that advanced base on 10 November, quickly completed repairs, and rejoined TG 38.2 off Luzon just after mid-month. Her return, however, proved brief; for, on 23 November, she received orders to return to Ulithi to join TG 38.1. At Ulithi, she conducted exercises until 10 December when she departed the atoll with TG 38.1 to support the landings on Mindoro. During that operation, TF 38 passed through the infamous typhoon of December 1944 which damaged many ships in the force and sank three. Wedderburn, however, suffered only minor damage and participated in the search for survivors of Hull (DD-350), Monaghan (DD-354), and Spence (DD-512) though she did not engage in any actual rescue operations. The damage caused by the typhoon necessitated a return to Ulithi for repairs. The destroyer and the other ships of TF 38 entered the lagoon on Christmas Eve and remained there six days, resuming operations on 30 December 1944. == 1945 == The return to sea brought TF 38 into active participation in support of the Luzon invasion at Lingayen. The fast carriers sought to keep Japanese reinforcements--airborne, naval, and land--from entering the fray against the invading forces by keeping enemy air-power grounded and by sinking as much of his shipping as possible. Thus, Wedderburn resumed her role as guardian of the carriers while their planes made up the offensive arm of the Third Fleet. On 3 and 4 January 1945, fast carrier aircraft hit air installations and shipping at Formosa and Okinawa. They went after targets on Luzon itself on the 6th and 7th and, on the 9th, the day of the initial landings, returned to Formosa for air suppression duty while troops were going ashore. Following that assignment, she moved through Bashi Channel with TF 38 for two weeks of air raids on Japanese-held southern China and French Indochina which included an anti-shipping sweep of the South China Sea. On the return voyage, TF 38 planes struck at the Nansei Shoto, a group of islands near Okinawa, on the 21st and 22d before reentering Ulithi Lagoon on the 25th. Soon thereafter, the Third Fleet became the Fifth Fleet when Admiral Raymond A. Spruance relieved Admiral William F. Halsey. The change in designation reflected the change of command only, and all else remained substantially as it was. Wedderburn continued to provide antisubmarine protection for her task group, redesignated TG 58.2. Early on 10 February, the fast carriers again stood out of Ulithi to provide air support for the assault on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands. On 16 February, they launched planes for a strike against air installations around Tokyo, the first air raid on the Japanese capital since 1942 when the Fast Carrier Task Force commander, Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher --then captain of Hornet (CV-8)--launched Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle's B-25 bombers on their famous raid. During the current two-day attack, the American planes made 138 sorties in which their pilots claimed to have sunk three picket boats and an escort carrier as well as to have destroyed over 700 enemy aircraft. Following the raid, Wedderburn escorted the carriers south to Iwo Jima where she participated in shore bombardments and patrolled against submarines in TF 51's transport area. On 23 February, she departed Iwo Jima and rejoined TG 58.2 as it headed off north with the rest of TF 58 for another round of strikes on the Japanese home islands. Foul weather, however, forced the cancellation of those strikes; and, after a refueling rendezvous, the carriers and their escorts reentered the lagoon at Ulithi on 4 March. After 10 days of refueling, rearming, and repairing, TF 58 left Ulithi and shaped a course for Japan. Their first targets were the airfields on Ky≈´sh≈´, located within striking range of Okinawa, the 5th Fleet's next objective. The carriers launched planes on 18 March, but the enemy struck back with fighters, bombers, and kamikazes. In the ensuing battle, near misses damaged Enterprise (CV-6), Yorktown (CV-10), and Intrepid (CV-11). The next day, Franklin (CV-13) received a direct bomb hit; and the enemy scored one on Wasp (CV-18) as well. However, on a more positive side, Wedderburn gunners claimed two of the attacking enemy planes. After TF 58 sustained the damage of 18 and 19 March, it was reorganized somewhat. Wedderburn's TG 58.2 became a task group made up of damaged carriers Enterprise, Franklin, and Wasp, and gave up a number of its screening units to the similarly reformed TG 58.1. Wedderburn was one of those escorts so reassigned and consequently remained with TF 58 while the task group of cripples retired to base. She continued to screen the carriers as they launched air strikes on Okinawa during the last week in March and the week following the 1 April landings. Throughout the entire period, the Japanese launched air attacks at them incessantly. It was not until the 6th, however, that sighting reports made it apparent that the enemy planned a suicidal surface attack with the remnants of their fleet. Superbattleship Yamato, screened by a cruiser and eight destroyers, started south to contest the landings. The fast carriers continued to steam on station off Okinawa protected by Wedderburn and her colleagues but, on 7 April, launched a series of search and attack sorties which ultimately sent the mighty Japanese battleship to the bottom along with light cruiser Yahagi and four of the escorting destroyers. After that scrape, TF 58 concentrated its efforts on supporting the troops ashore and defending itself and the invasion force from the final onslaught of Japanese air power. Wedderburn remained in the vicinity of the Ryukyu Islands for another 20 days until TG 58.1 headed for Ulithi on 27 April. On 18 May, the destroyer departed Ulithi to escort Missouri (BB-63) to Guam to pick up Admiral William F. Halsey who was scheduled to take command of the naval forces off Okinawa later that month. She then escorted Missouri back to the Ryukyus and reentered the fray at Okinawa at the beginning of the final week of May. Halsey took over from Admiral Raymond Spruance on 27 May; and--now that Admiral Halsey was back in overall command--Wedderburn and her associates became units of the 3d Fleet rather than of the 5th Fleet. For the remainder of World War II, she screened various task groups of TF 38 first while they continued support for the Okinawa operation and, later that summer, when they went on their final rampage in the Japanese home islands. The Japanese capitulation on 15 August found her in the screen of TG 38.4 while the carriers were preparing for yet another air strike--one which they did not launch. Immediately following the war, the destroyer served with the occupation forces around Tokyo Bay, escorting Japanese merchant ships, supervising mine-clearing operations, and making hydrographic surveys. On 31 October, she shaped a course back to the United States. After a stop at Pearl Harbor from 9 to 13 November, she resumed her voyage and arrived at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 19 November. Following repairs at Puget Sound, she was placed out of commission in March 1946 and was berthed at San Diego. == 1950 - 1953 == In August 1946, she returned to semi-activity when she began training naval reservists, until 21 November 1950 when she was recommissioned, Comdr. Richard B. Franklin in command. The newly recommissioned destroyer joined the Pacific Fleet Destroyer Force in January 1951; completed her reactivation work at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard; and, in May, finished underway training. On 18 June, she departed the west coast for her first tour of duty in the Korean War. Though assigned operationally to the Blockading and Escort Force (TF 95), she also served periodically as a plane guard for the fast carriers of TF 77 as well as on the Taiwan Strait patrol (TF 72). For the most part, though, her duties consisted of blockading the coastline of Korea and providing gunfire support for the United Nations troops operating ashore. She concluded her first tour of duty in the Far East with the Taiwan Strait patrol and returned to the United States in February 1952. After an overhaul at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard and several weeks of training, the warship headed back to Korea in August 1952. Once again, she divided her time between blockading and gunfire support missions along the Korean coast and escort duty with the fast carriers as well as short periods with the Taiwan Strait patrol. Wedderburn concluded her second Korean War deployment and returned to San Diego in March 1953. During the next seven months, the destroyer conducted normal west coast operations out of San Diego. The Korean War ended with the armistice of 27 July 1953 right near the midpoint of Wedderburn's seven months of 1st Fleet operations. When she returned to the Far East in October, she began the first essentially peacetime deployment of her career. == 1954 - 1964 == guns at a target drone aircraft, during exercises, 21 August 1964. In the decade between 1954 and 1964, the warship continued to alternate deployments to the western Pacific with tours of duty along the coast of southern California. For the most part, the seven tours she made to the Far East consisted of port visits and training exercises. During the 1958 deployment, she visited Sydney, Australia, in addition to her usual ports of call farther north and participated in the multinational SEATO exercise, Operation Ocean Link. That deployment also saw her on patrol in the Taiwan Strait during the American show of force over the Quemoy and Matsu bombardment by the Chinese communists. The remainder of her deployments were more routine in nature consisting of plane guard duty with TF 77, port visits, training exercises, and periods of time with the Taiwan Strait patrol. When not in the Orient, she conducted type training, upkeep, and periodic overhauls on the west coast. The warship departed San Diego on 5 August 1964 to begin her 11th deployment to the Far East. Four days before, the Gulf of Tonkin incident occurred, signaling a stepped-up American involvement in the strife in South Vietnam. That involvement dictated the nature of Wedderburn's 7th Fleet assignments for the remainder of her active career. During the fall of 1964, she operated off the Vietnamese coast as plane guard and escort for TF 77, duplicating her service during World War II and the Korean War. She departed the newly established combat zone in November for a SEATO weapons demonstration and then put into Subic Bay in the Philippines for upkeep. == 1965 - 1969 == After Christmas liberty at Yokosuka, Japan, she returned to active operations in the South China Sea in January 1965. At the conclusion of that duty, late in the month, she set course for home, arriving in San Diego on 6 February. She spent the remainder of 1965 in the eastern Pacific. After a month of post-deployment stand-down followed by four weeks of local operations out of San Diego, she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for a month-long availability. In June and July, she embarked NROTC midshipmen for their summer cruise, during which she visited San Francisco and the islands of Kauai and Oahu in Hawaii. Returning to San Diego on 4 August, the warship conducted three weeks of repairs and then resumed training operations which continued until she began preparations for another Far Eastern cruise in November. On 7 January 1966, Wedderburn departed San Diego in company with Worden (DLG-18), Richard B. Anderson (DD-786), and Bausell (DD-845). After stops at Oahu, Midway, and Guam, she arrived in Subic Bay on 28 January. On 1 February, she headed for the South China Sea where she became a unit of TG 77.5 and served as escort and plane guard for the carriers until 28 February. Following a brief return to Subic Bay, she visited Sasebo, Japan, and Okinawa early in March. She returned to the Vietnam combat zone on 12 March as a unit of TG 77.7 and again served as escort and plane guard for carriers conducting air strikes in North Vietnam. She continued in that role until 2 April when she was detached and reassigned to Task Unit (TU) 70.8.9 to conduct gunfire support missions near Danang and Quang Tri. On the 6th, the warship resumed her former assignment with TG 77.7. On 24 April, she joined a different unit, TU 77.0.3, to conduct trawler surveillance in the Gulf of Tonkin. On 2 May, she returned to gunfire support duty, this time near Chu Lai, until 8 May. On that day, the destroyer resumed duty with TF 77 as a search and rescue (SAR) vessel on the southern SAR station. On 15 May, she concluded her last combat assignment of the 1966 deployment. After a week's liberty call at Hong Kong and repairs at Yokosuka, Wedderburn headed home on 3 June and arrived in San Diego 10 days later. Following local operations, the destroyer entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 11 August for a three-month overhaul. She completed sea trials on 20 November and resumed normal operations on the 21st. During the first two months of 1967, Wedderburn conducted extensive refresher training exercises and, during March and early April, made preparations for overseas movement. On 8 April, she stood out of San Diego once more in company with Worden, Brush (DD-745), and Lyman K. Swenson (DD-729). She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 14 to 17 April and arrived in Yokosuka on the 27th. Three days later, she got underway for Okinawa whence she continued on to Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin where she conducted plane guard duty with TG 77.6. Five days later, she shifted to shore bombardment duty near the demilitarized zone (DMZ). That assignment lasted until 27 May when she returned to the carriers on Yankee Station. She left the combat zone on 5 June and arrived in Subic Bay two days later. She made repairs and embarked two NROTC midshipmen and then departed the Philippines on 10 June to return to the Gulf of Tonkin. There, she divided her time between plane guard duty for Hancock (CVA-19) and ASW exercises with Bronstein (DE-1037) and Catfish (SS-339). She visited Kaohsiung, Taiwan, from 25 June to 10 July and underwent repairs alongside Delta (AR-9). On her return to the coast of Vietnam, she rejoined TU 70.8.9 for a series of gunfire support missions in the I Corps zone of operations. Her guns helped the marines ashore complete Operation Bear Chain, an amphibious assault by Special Landing Force \\"Bravo\\" near Quang Tri City. On 21 July, she headed back to Subic Bay for a week of repairs and upkeep. She did not return to the Vietnamese coast for a month due to repairs to her evaporator system. However, on 20 August, she headed back to the combat zone where, on the 22d, she resumed gunfire support duty for troops in the II Corps zone. Relieved by Eaton (DD-510) on 26 August, she rejoined TF 77 in the Gulf of Tonkin and served as escort for the carriers until 3 September. She departed the Gulf of Tonkin late on the 3d and shaped a course for Okinawa, arriving there on the 7th. From there, she moved on to Yokosuka for a 10-day layover before getting underway for home on the 21st. Wedderburn reached San Diego on 6 October and began the normal post-deployment stand-down. In mid-November, she resumed normal operations in the southern California operating area. That routine continued until she began repairs at Long Beach on 19 April 1968. She returned to San Diego on 24 May and resumed normal operations out of her home port. Wedderburn embarked upon the final western Pacific deployment of her career on 30 September. Steaming in company with Hornet (CVS-12), she stopped at Oahu for nine days in mid-October and then continued her voyage to Yokosuka, where she arrived on the 27th. On the 30th, she accompanied Hornet out of Yokosuka, and together, they laid course for the Tonkin Gulf. They arrived in the gulf on 3 November; but, two days later, Wedderburn became an escort for Constellation (CVA-64) for two days. After that, she rejoined her old colleague, Hancock. On 17 November, a recurring sonar problem forced the destroyer to head for Subic Bay, where she remained until 9 December. She returned to duty in the Tonkin Gulf on 11 December but remained on station only until the 31st when steam leaks forced her back to Subic Bay. She completed repairs late in January 1969 and returned to the combat zone soon thereafter. The warship remained on station, dividing her time between gunfire support, carrier escort, and Soviet trawler surveillance, until mid-March. After a brief return to Subic Bay, she began her final tour of duty on the gunline on 22 March. Wedderburn served as a gunfire support ship for about a month before beginning her homeward voyage on 20 April. En route, she made stops at Yokosuka, Japan, and Buckner Bay, Okinawa; and arrived back in San Diego on 12 May. She remained in port throughout the summer of 1969 due to a casualty to her propulsion plant and, in September, received word that she was going to be decommissioned. On 1 October 1969, Wedderburn was placed out of commission at San Diego, and her name was struck from the Navy list. On 25 January 1972, she was sold to Dhon's Iron & Steel Co., Ltd., for scrapping. Wedderburn earned seven battle stars for World War II service, four battle stars for Korean War service, and six battle stars for service in the Vietnam War. == References == * == External links == * navsource.org: USS Wedderburn * hazegray.org: USS Wedderburn Category:World War II destroyers of the United States Category:Cold War destroyers of the United States Category:Korean War destroyers of the United States Category:Vietnam War destroyers of the United States Category:Ships built in San Francisco Category:1943 ships Category:Fletcher-class destroyers of the United States Navy ","title":"USS Wedderburn"},{"id":"1427442","text":"President and Mrs. Truman at the Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner, 1952 Jefferson‚ÄìJackson Day is the annual fundraising celebration (dinner) held by Democratic Party organizations in the United States.Obama sets sights on November battle It is named for Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, which the party calls its founders.

Second row: a diorite vase, a flint knife, a cosmetic palette. The prehistory of Egypt spans the period from the earliest human settlement to the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period around 3100 BC, starting with the first Pharaoh, Narmer for some Egyptologists, Hor-Aha for others, with the name Menes also possibly used for one of these kings. This Predynastic era is traditionally equivalent to the final part of the Neolithic period beginning c. 6000 BC and ending in the Naqada III period c. 3000 BC. The dates of the Predynastic period were first defined before widespread archaeological excavation of Egypt took place, and recent finds indicating very gradual Predynastic development have led to controversy over when exactly the Predynastic period ended. Thus, various terms such as \\"Protodynastic period\\", \\"Zero Dynasty\\" or \\"Dynasty 0\\" are used to name the part of the period which might be characterized as Predynastic by some and Early Dynastic by others. The Predynastic period is generally divided into cultural eras, each named after the place where a certain type of Egyptian settlement was first discovered. However, the same gradual development that characterizes the Protodynastic period is present throughout the entire Predynastic period, and individual \\"cultures\\" must not be interpreted as separate entities but as largely subjective divisions used to facilitate study of the entire period. The vast majority of Predynastic archaeological finds have been in Upper Egypt, because the silt of the Nile River was more heavily deposited at the Delta region, completely burying most Delta sites long before modern times. ==Paleolithic== Excavation of the Nile has exposed early stone tools from the last million or so years. The earliest of these lithic industries were located within a 30-metre (100 ft) terrace, and were primitive Acheulean, Abbevillian (Chellean) ( 600,000 years ago), and an Egyptian form of the Clactonian ( 400,000 years ago). Within the 15-metre (50 ft) terrace was developed Acheulean. Originally reported as early Mousterian ( 160,000 years ago) but since changed to Levalloisean, other implements were located in the 10-metre (30 ft) terrace. The 4.5- and 3-metre (15‚Äì10 ft) terraces saw a more developed version of the Levalloisean, also initially reported as an Egyptian version of Mousterian. An Egyptian version of the Aterian technology was also located. ===Wadi Halfa=== Aterian point from Zaccar, Djelfa region, Algeria. Some of the oldest known structures were discovered in Egypt by archaeologist Waldemar Chmielewski along the southern border near Wadi Halfa, Sudan in Arkin 8 site. Chmielewski dated the structures to 100,000 BC. The remains of the structures are oval depressions about 30 cm deep and 2 √ó 1 meters across. Many are lined with flat sandstone slabs. They are called tent rings, because the rocks supported a dome-like shelter of skins or brush. This type of dwelling provided a place to live, but if necessary, could be taken down easily and moved. They were mobile structures‚Äîeasily disassembled, moved, and reassembled‚Äîproviding hunter-gatherers with semi-permanent habitation. ===Aterian industry=== Aterian tool-making reached Egypt c. 40,000 BC. ===Khormusan industry=== The Khormusan industry in Egypt began between 42,000 and 32,000 BP. Khormusans developed tools not only from stone but also from animal bones and hematite. They also developed small arrow heads resembling those of Native Americans, but no bows have been found. The end of the Khormusan industry came around 16,000 B.C. with the appearance of other cultures in the region, including the Gemaian.Nicolas-Christophe Grimal. A History of Ancient Egypt. p. 20. Blackwell (1994). ===Late Paleolithic=== The Late Paleolithic in Egypt started around 30,000 BC. The Nazlet Khater skeleton was found in 1980 and dated in 1982 from nine samples ranging between 35,100 and 30,360 years. This specimen is the only complete modern human skeleton from the earliest Late Stone Age in Africa. ==Mesolithic== ===Halfan and Kubbaniyan culture=== Map of Egypt The Halfan and Kubbaniyan, two closely related industries, flourished along the Upper Nile Valley. Halfan sites are found in the far north of Sudan, whereas Kubbaniyan sites are found in Upper Egypt. For the Halfan, only four radiocarbon dates have been produced. Schild and Wendorf (2014) discard the earliest and latest as erratic and conclude that the Halfan existed c. 22.5-22.0 ka cal BP. People survived on a diet of large herd animals and the Khormusan tradition of fishing. Greater concentrations of artifacts indicate that they were not bound to seasonal wandering, but settled for longer periods. The Halfan culture was derived in turn from the Khormusan, which depended on specialized hunting, fishing, and collecting techniques for survival. The primary material remains of this culture are stone tools, flakes, and a multitude of rock paintings. ===Sebilian culture=== In Egypt, analyses of pollen found at archaeological sites indicate that the Sebilian culture (also known as the Esna culture) were gathering wheat and barley. The Sebilian culture began around 13,000 B.C and vanished around 10,000 B.C Domesticated seeds were not found (modern wheat and barley originated in Asia Minor and Canaan). It has been hypothesized that the sedentary lifestyle used by farmers led to increased warfare, which was detrimental to farming and brought this period to an end. ===Qadan culture=== The Qadan culture (13,000‚Äì9,000 BC) was a Mesolithic industry that, archaeological evidence suggests, originated in Upper Egypt (present-day south Egypt) approximately 15,000 years ago.Phillipson, DW: African Archaeology p. 149. Cambridge University Press, 2005.Shaw, I & Jameson, R: A Dictionary of Archaeology, p. 136. Blackwell Publishers Ltd, 2002. The Qadan subsistence mode is estimated to have persisted for approximately 4,000 years. It was characterized by hunting, as well as a unique approach to food gathering that incorporated the preparation and consumption of wild grasses and grains. Systematic efforts were made by the Qadan people to water, care for, and harvest local plant life, but grains were not planted in ordered rows.Darvill, T: The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology, Copyright ¬© 2002, 2003 by Oxford University Press. Around twenty archaeological sites in Upper Nubia give evidence for the existence of the Qadan culture's grain-grinding culture. Its makers also practiced wild grain harvesting along the Nile during the beginning of the Sahaba Daru Nile phase, when desiccation in the Sahara caused residents of the Libyan oases to retreat into the Nile valley. Among the Qadan culture sites is the Jebel Sahaba cemetery, which has been dated to the Mesolithic. Qadan peoples were the first to develop sickles and they also developed grinding stones independently to aid in the collecting and processing of these plant foods prior to consumption. However, there are no indications of the use of these tools after around 10,000 BC, when hunter- gatherers replaced them. ===Harifian culture=== The Harifians are viewed as migrating out of the Fayyum and the eastern deserts of Egypt during the late Mesolithic to merge with the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) culture, whose tool assemblage resembles that of the Harifian. This assimilation led to the Circum-Arabian Nomadic Pastoral Complex, a group of cultures that invented nomadic pastoralism, and may have been the original culture which spread Proto-Semitic languages throughout Mesopotamia. ==Neolithic== ===Lower Egypt=== ====Faiyum A culture==== Map of Lower Egypt, and location of the Fayum oasis Continued expansion of the desert forced the early ancestors of the Egyptians to settle around the Nile more permanently and adopt a more sedentary lifestyle during the Neolithic. The period from 9000 to 6000 BC has left very little in the way of archaeological evidence. Around 6000 BC, Neolithic settlements appear all over Egypt. Studies based on morphological, genetic, and archaeological data have attributed these settlements to migrants from the Fertile Crescent in the Near East returning during the Egyptian and North African Neolithic, bringing agriculture to the region. Jared Diamond, in a non-scholarly work, proposes other regions in Africa independently developed agriculture at about the same time: the Ethiopian highlands, the Sahel, and West Africa. Arrowheads from Al Fayum. Some morphological and post-cranial data has linked the earliest farming populations at Fayum, Merimde, and El- Badari, to Near Eastern populations.Smith, P. (2002) The palaeo-biological evidence for admixture between populations in the southern Levant and Egypt in the fourth to third millennia BCE. In: Egypt and the Levant: Interrelations from the 4th through the Early 3rd Millennium BCE, London‚ÄìNew York: Leicester University Press, 118‚Äì128Kemp, B. 2005 \\"Ancient Egypt Anatomy of a Civilisation\\". Routledge. p. 52‚Äì60 However, the archaeological data also suggests that Near Eastern domesticates were incorporated into a pre-existing foraging strategy and only slowly developed into a full-blown lifestyle, contrary to what would be expected from settler colonists from the Near East. Finally, the names for the Near Eastern domesticates imported into Egypt were not Sumerian or Proto-Semitic loan words, which further diminishes the likelihood of a mass immigrant colonization of lower Egypt during the transition to agriculture. Weaving is evidenced for the first time during the Faiyum A Period. People of this period, unlike later Egyptians, buried their dead very close to, and sometimes inside, their settlements. Merimde culture clay head, circa 5,000 BCE. This is one of the earliest known representations of a human head in Egypt. Although archaeological sites reveal very little about this time, an examination of the many Egyptian words for \\"city\\" provides a hypothetical list of causes of Egyptian sedentarism. In Upper Egypt, terminology indicates trade, protection of livestock, high ground for flood refuge, and sacred sites for deities. ====Merimde culture==== From about 5000 to 4200 BC the Merimde culture, so far only known from a large settlement site at the edge of the Western Delta, flourished in Lower Egypt. The culture has strong connections to the Faiyum A culture as well as the Levant. People lived in small huts, produced a simple undecorated pottery and had stone tools. Cattle, sheep, goats and pigs were held. Wheat, sorghum and barley were planted. The Merimde people buried their dead within the settlement and produced clay figurines. The first life-sized Egyptian head made of clay comes from Merimde. ====El Omari culture==== The El Omari culture is known from a small settlement near modern Cairo. People seem to have lived in huts, but only postholes and pits survive. The pottery is undecorated. Stone tools include small flakes, axes and sickles. Metal was not yet known. Their sites were occupied from 4000 BC to the Archaic Period. ====Maadi culture==== The prisoners on the Battlefield Palette may be the people of the Buto-Maadi culture subjected by the Egyptian rulers of Naqada III. The Maadi culture (also called Buto Maadi culture) is the most important Lower Egyptian prehistoric culture contemporary with Naqada I and II phases in Upper Egypt. The culture is best known from the site Maadi near Cairo, but is also attested in many other places in the Delta to the Faiyum region. This culture was marked by development in architecture and technology. It also followed its predecessor cultures when it comes to undecorated ceramics. Copper was known, and some copper adzes have been found. The pottery is simple and undecorated and shows, in some forms, strong connections to the southern Levant. People lived in small huts, partly dug into the ground. The dead were buried in cemeteries, but with few burial goods. The Maadi culture was replaced by the Naqada III culture; whether this happened by conquest or infiltration is still an open question.

Nabta Playa was once a large internally drained basin in the Nubian Desert, located approximately 800 kilometers south of modern-day Cairo or about 100 kilometers west of Abu Simbel in southern Egypt, 22.51¬∞ north, 30.73¬∞ east. Today the region is characterized by numerous archaeological sites. The Nabta Playa archaeological site, one of the earliest of the Egyptian Neolithic Period, is dated to circa 7500 BC. ====Tasian culture==== The Tasian culture was the next in Upper Egypt. This culture group is named for the burials found at Der Tasa, on the east bank of the Nile between Asyut and Akhmim. The Tasian culture group is notable for producing the earliest blacktop-ware, a type of red and brown pottery that is colored black on the top portion and interior. This pottery is vital to the dating of Predynastic Egypt. Because all dates for the Predynastic period are tenuous at best, WMF Petrie developed a system called sequence dating by which the relative date, if not the absolute date, of any given Predynastic site can be ascertained by examining its pottery. As the Predynastic period progressed, the handles on pottery evolved from functional to ornamental. The degree to which any given archaeological site has functional or ornamental pottery can also be used to determine the relative date of the site. Since there is little difference between Tasian ceramics and Badarian pottery, the Tasian Culture overlaps the Badarian range significantly.Gardiner, Alan, Egypt of the Pharaohs (Oxford: University Press, 1964), p. 389. From the Tasian period onward, it appears that Upper Egypt was influenced strongly by the culture of Lower Egypt.Grimal, Nicolas. A History of Ancient Egypt. p.35. Librairie Arth√©me Fayard, 1988. ====Badarian culture==== Ancient Badarian mortuary figurine of a woman, held at the Louvre The Badarian culture, from about 4400 to 4000 BC, is named for the Badari site near Der Tasa. It followed the Tasian culture, but was so similar that many consider them one continuous period. The Badarian Culture continued to produce the kind of pottery called blacktop-ware (albeit much improved in quality) and was assigned Sequence Dating numbers 21‚Äì29. The primary difference that prevents scholars from merging the two periods is that Badarian sites use copper in addition to stone and are thus chalcolithic settlements, while the Neolithic Tasian sites are still considered Stone Age. Badarian flint tools continued to develop into sharper and more shapely blades, and the first faience was developed.Grimal, Nicolas. A History of Ancient Egypt. p.24. Librairie Arth√©me Fayard, 1988 Distinctly Badarian sites have been located from Nekhen to a little north of Abydos.Gardiner, Alan, Egypt of the Pharaohs (Oxford: University Press, 1964), p. 391. It appears that the Fayum A culture and the Badarian and Tasian Periods overlapped significantly; however, the Fayum A culture was considerably less agricultural and was still Neolithic in nature.Newell, G.D. \\"A re-examination of the Badarian Culture\\" Academia.edu, 2012 ====Naqada culture==== Evolution of Egyptian prehistoric pottery styles, from Naqada I to Naqada II and Naqada III The Naqada culture is an archaeological culture of Chalcolithic Predynastic Egypt (ca. 4000-3000 BC), named for the town of Naqada, Qena Governorate. It is divided in three sub- periods: Naqada I, II and III. Amratian culture (Naqada I) Ovoid Naqada I (Amratian) black-topped terracotta vase, (c. 3800-3500 BC). The Amratian culture lasted from about 4000 to 3500 BC. It is named after the site of El-Amra, about 120 km south of Badari. El-Amra is the first site where this culture group was found unmingled with the later Gerzean culture group, but this period is better attested at the Naqada site, so it also is referred to as the Naqada I culture. Black-topped ware continues to appear, but white cross-line ware, a type of pottery which has been decorated with close parallel white lines being crossed by another set of close parallel white lines, is also found at this time. The Amratian period falls between S.D. 30 and 39 in Petrie's Sequence Dating system.Gardiner, Alan, Egypt of the Pharaohs (Oxford: University Press, 1964), p. 390. Newly excavated objects attest to increased trade between Upper and Lower Egypt at this time. A stone vase from the north was found at el-Amra, and copper, which is not mined in Egypt, was imported from the Sinai, or possibly Nubia. ObsidianGrimal, Nicolas. A History of Ancient Egypt. p. 28. Librairie Arth√©me Fayard, 1988 and a small amount of gold were both definitely imported from Nubia. Trade with the oases also was likely. New innovations appeared in Amratian settlements as precursors to later cultural periods. For example, the mud-brick buildings for which the Gerzean period is known were first seen in Amratian times, but only in small numbers.Redford, Donald B. Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times. Princeton: University Press, 1992, p. 7. Additionally, oval and theriomorphic cosmetic palettes appear in this period, but the workmanship is very rudimentary and the relief artwork for which they were later known is not yet present.Gardiner, Alan, Egypt of the Pharaohs. Oxford: University Press, 1964, p. 393.Newell, G. D., \\"The Relative chronology of PNC I\\" (Academia.Edu: 2012) Gerzean culture (Naqada II) A typical Naqada II pot with ship theme The Gerzean culture, from about 3500 to 3200 BC, is named after the site of Gerzeh. It was the next stage in Egyptian cultural development, and it was during this time that the foundation of Dynastic Egypt was laid. Gerzean culture is largely an unbroken development out of Amratian Culture, starting in the delta and moving south through upper Egypt, but failing to dislodge Amratian culture in Nubia.Redford, Donald B. Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times. (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 16. Gerzean pottery is assigned values from S.D. 40 through 62, and is distinctly different from Amratian white cross-lined wares or black-topped ware. Gerzean pottery was painted mostly in dark red with pictures of animals, people, and ships, as well as geometric symbols that appear derived from animals. Also, \\"wavy\\" handles, rare before this period (though occasionally found as early as S.D. 35) became more common and more elaborate until they were almost completely ornamental. Gerzean culture coincided with a significant decline in rainfall,Redford, Donald B. Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times. (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 17. and farming along the Nile now produced the vast majority of food, though contemporary paintings indicate that hunting was not entirely forgone. With increased food supplies, Egyptians adopted a much more sedentary lifestyle and cities grew as large as 5,000. It was in this time that Egyptian city dwellers stopped building with reeds and began mass-producing mud bricks, first found in the Amratian Period, to build their cities. Egyptian stone tools, while still in use, moved from bifacial construction to ripple-flaked construction. Copper was used for all kinds of tools, and the first copper weaponry appears here. Silver, gold, lapis, and faience were used ornamentally, and the grinding palettes used for eye-paint since the Badarian period began to be adorned with relief carvings. The first tombs in classic Egyptian style were also built, modeled after ordinary houses and sometimes composed of multiple rooms. Although further excavations in the Delta are needed, this style is generally believed to originate there and not in Upper Egypt. Although the Gerzean Culture is now clearly identified as being the continuation of the Amratian period, significant Mesopotamian influence worked its way into Egypt during the Gerzean, interpreted in previous years as evidence of a Mesopotamian ruling class, the so-called Dynastic Race, coming to power over Upper Egypt. This idea no longer attracts academic support. Distinctly foreign objects and art forms entered Egypt during this period, indicating contacts with several parts of Asia. Objects such as the Gebel el-Arak knife handle, which has patently Mesopotamian relief carvings on it, have been found in Egypt,Shaw, Ian. & Nicholson, Paul, The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, (London: British Museum Press, 1995), p. 109. and the silver which appears in this period can only have been obtained from Asia Minor. Naqada figure of a woman interpreted to represent the goddess Bat with her inward curving horns, c. 3500‚Äì3400 B.C.E. terracotta, painted, , Brooklyn Museum In addition, Egyptian objects are created which clearly mimic Mesopotamian forms, although not slavishly.Redford, Donald B. Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times. (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 18. Cylinder seals appear in Egypt, as well as recessed paneling architecture, the Egyptian reliefs on cosmetic palettes are clearly made in the same style as the contemporary Mesopotamian Uruk culture, and the ceremonial mace heads which turn up from the late Gerzean and early Semainean are crafted in the Mesopotamian \\"pear-shaped\\" style, instead of the Egyptian native style. The route of this trade is difficult to determine, but contact with Canaan does not predate the early dynastic, so it is usually assumed to have been conducted over water.Redford, Donald B. Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times. (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 22. During the time when the Dynastic Race Theory was still popular, it was theorized that Uruk sailors circumnavigated Arabia, but a Mediterranean route, probably by middlemen through Byblos, is more likely, as evidenced by the presence of Byblian objects in Egypt. The fact that so many Gerzean sites are at the mouths of wadis that lead to the Red Sea may indicate some amount of trade via the Red Sea (though Byblian trade potentially could have crossed the Sinai and then taken the Red Sea).Redford, Donald B. Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times. (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 20. Also, it is considered unlikely that something so complicated as recessed panel architecture could have worked its way into Egypt by proxy, and at least a small contingent of migrants is often suspected. Despite this evidence of foreign influence, Egyptologists generally agree that the Gerzean Culture is still predominantly indigenous to Egypt. Protodynastic Period (Naqada III) Bull palette, Naqada III. The Naqada III period, from about 3200 to 3000 BC, is generally taken to be identical with the Protodynastic period, during which Egypt was unified. Naqada III is notable for being the first era with hieroglyphs (though this is disputed by some), the first regular use of serekhs, the first irrigation, and the first appearance of royal cemeteries. The relatively affluent Maadi suburb of Cairo is built over the original Naqada stronghold. Kingscorpion.jpgThe Scorpion Macehead, Ashmolean Museum.

John Shortland, who discovered the Hunter River (New South Wales). A postage stamp design error is a mistake made during the design phase of the postage stamp production process. Design errors most commonly occur as minor mistakes, such as a missing letter in the binomial name of an organism depicted on the stamp, but some have been major gaffes, such as a map appearing to lay claim to another country's territory, or the depiction of the wrong person on the stamp. A design error caught during the production process may disappear quietly, with copies of the error only getting into the public's hands via unscrupulous employees (these are therefore not considered \\"real\\" stamps). Design errors are often caught during the distribution process, when large numbers of postal workers are scrutinizing the new stamp; although officials may elect to withdraw all the stamps at that point, it is very difficult to retrieve every one of them, and in these instances a few may end up being sold and used. The exact circumstance are important, because once the stamp is sold to a customer, whether or not against the postal service's rules, it is considered to be legitimate. The Legends of the West sheet was a particularly difficult case. Shortly before the release of this commemorative series (and after sheets had already been sent to post offices and found their way into collectors' hands), a claim was made that the image of Bill Pickett used for his stamp's painting was actually an image of his brother Ben. The United States Postal Service decided to recall the stamps and re-issue them later with Pickett's stamp based on an image known with certainty to be him. The USPS sold the entire run of erroneous stamps at face value by lottery.Hess Design Works.com US Stamps - Legends of the West. Retrieved February 13, 2009. Somewhat rarer is a design error that is first noticed by a member of the public. This usually happens within a few days of the stamp first going on sale, and usually ends up as the subject of newspaper articles. A recent example of this is the Maya Angelou stamp issued by the U.S. Postal Service on April 7, 2015. The stamp contains a quotation that had been frequently attributed to Ms. Angelou, but was really written by Joan Walsh Anglund. In this circumstance, the Postal Service was unaware of the real author until it was brought to their attention by The Washington Post. The response of postal officials may include withdrawal of all the stamps, or simply the suspension of printing and distribution, pending revision and reprinting. If the stamps are withdrawn, then the ones already out there become instant rarities, as happened with the PRC's \\"All China is Red\\" stamp of 1968. The withdrawn stamps may be destroyed or overprinted if the design can be repaired that way. Design errors occurring during chaotic times such as revolutions will simply become a topic of discussion for future philatelists. Similarly for errors occurring in highly technical aspects, such as the spelling of a scientific name of a plant or animal, and may not be noticed during the stamp's period of use. == Some notable design errors == An East German stamp in 1956 commemorated Robert Schumann, but the musical score in the background was actually by Franz Schubert (top stamp).

Sometimes called a \\"forced choice\\" scale, this contrasts Likert- type scales in which respondents score, often from 1 to 5, how much they agree with a given statement (see also Norm-referenced test). ==Psychology== While mean scores from Likert-type scales can be compared across individuals, scores from an ipsative measure cannot. To explain, if an individual was equally Extroverted and Conscientious and was assessed on a Likert-type scale, each trait would be evaluated singularly, i.e. a respondent would see the item \\"I enjoy parties.\\" and agree or disagree with it to whatever degree reflected his/her preferences. If the same traits were evaluated on an ipsative measure, respondents would be forced to choose between the two, i.e. a respondent would see the item \\"Which of these do you agree with more strongly? a) I like parties. b) I keep my work space neat and tidy.\\" Ipsative measures may be more useful for evaluating traits within an individual, whereas Likert-type scales are more useful for evaluating traits across individuals. Additionally, ipsative measures may be useful in identifying faking. However, ipsative measures may, especially among testing-na√Øve individuals exhibiting high levels of conscientiousness and/or neuroticism, decrease test validity by discouraging response and/or encouraging non-response. For example, a test's authors may force respondents to choose between \\"a) Animals chase me in my dreams\\" and \\"b) My dreams are nice\\" in an effort to see whether a given respondent is more inclined toward \\"faking bad\\" or toward \\"faking good.\\" When faced with such a question, a child frequently terrified by nightmares that rarely if ever involve animals, and especially one whose parents have taught him/her strict rules against lying, may simply refuse to answer the question given that for that respondent nearly all of the time both descriptions are inaccurate. Even a previously presented guideline \\"Choose the answer that [best/better] describes you\\" may be unhelpful in such a situation to responders who worry that endorsing one item or the other will still involve stating it to be accurate or \\"well\\"-descriptive to some positive degree. Only if the guideline is presented as \\"Choose the answer that more accurately or less inaccurately describes you\\" and the above-described responder is sophisticated enough to reason out his/her response in terms of \\"Despite the infrequency with which I have nice dreams, I have them [more frequently / less infrequently] than dreams in which animals chase me\\" (or, in theory, vice versa) will such a responder be willing to answer the question ‚Äî and phrasing the guideline in this way bears its own cost of making the question reveal less about the respondent's propensities because the respondent is no longer forced to \\"fake\\" one way or another. ==Education== In education, ipsative assessment is the practice of assessing present performance against the prior performance of the person being assessed. One place where this might be implemented is in reference to tests used with K-12 students in the United States, where value-added modeling of teacher performance is currently popular. Ipsative assessment can be contrasted with criterion-referenced assessment and norm-referenced assessment. Ipsative assessment is used in everyday life, and features heavily in physical education and also in computer games. Encouraging pupils to beat their previous scores can take peer pressure out of situations and eliminates the competitive element associated with norm- based referencing. It can be particularly useful for children with learning disabilities and can improve motivation. ==See also== * Concept inventory * Criterion-referenced assessment * Norm-referenced assessment * Psychological assessment * Psychometrics * Standardized test * Two-alternative forced choice ==References== ==Further reading== * Blinkhorn, S, Johnson, C and Wood, R.

In 2005, film critic David Kehr of The New York Times described \\"the hulking Tierney\\" as \\"not so much an actor as a frightening force of nature\\". ==Early life== Lawrence James Tierney was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Mary Alice (n√©e Crowley) and Lawrence Hugh Tierney. His father was an Irish-American policeman with the New York aqueduct police force. Tierney was a star athlete at Boys' High School, winning awards for track and field and joining Omega Gamma Delta fraternity. He earned an athletic scholarship to Manhattan College but quit after two years to work temporarily as a laborer constructing a section of the 85-mile-long Delaware Aqueduct, which supplies nearly half of New York City's water supply. He then bounced around the country from job to job, working for a time as a catalogue model for Sears Roebuck & Company. ==Career== After an acting coach suggested he try the stage, Tierney joined the Black Friars theatre group, moving on to the American-Irish Theatre. He was spotted there in 1943 by an RKO talent scout and given a film contract. In 1943 and 1944, Tierney was cast in several uncredited roles in RKO releases such as Gildersleeve on Broadway, Government Girl, The Ghost Ship for producer Val Lewton, The Falcon Out West, Seven Days Ashore, and Youth Runs Wild, also for Lewton. ===Dillinger and stardom=== Tierney's breakthrough role was starring as famous 1930s bank robber John Dillinger in 1945's Dillinger, made for the King Brothers and Monogram Pictures, which borrowed him from RKO. Advertised as a tale \\"written in bullets, blood, and blondes\\", Dillinger was initially banned from theaters in Chicago and other cities where the gangster had operated. A low-budget production that cost $60,000 to make, Dillinger nevertheless proved popular, with Tierney being characterized as \\"memorably menacing\\".McGilligan, Patrick. Backstory 2: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1940s and 1950s. Berkeley: University of California Press, c1991. http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft0z09n7m0/ Back at RKO, Tierney resumed his work there in small and supporting roles in Those Endearing Young Charms (1945), Back to Bataan (1945) (with John Wayne in one scene), Mama Loves Papa (1946), and in the Western Badman's Territory (1946) in which he portrays Jesse James. However, as ticket sales for Dillinger continued to rise and that film's financial success became apparent at RKO, the studio promoted Tierney in 1946 to star status in Step by Step, another film noir, one that portrays an ex-Marine being falsely accused of murder. He next starred as a reformed prison inmate in the 1946 release San Quentin. The next year he was cast as the lead in two more RKO productions that have since gained cult followings among film noir enthusiasts: The Devil Thumbs a Ride directed by Felix E. Feist and the more notorious Born to Kill directed by Robert Wise. In Feist's film, Tierney plays a homicidal hitch-hiker, while under Wise's direction he portrays a suave but murderous conman. Film critic Bosley Crowther of The New York Times condemned Born to Kill upon its release in 1947, professing that it was \\"not only morally disgusting but an offense to a normal intellect.\\" He decried Tierney \\"as the bold, bad killer whose ambition is to 'fix it so's I can spit in anybody's eye,'\\" being \\"given outrageous license to demonstrate the histrionics of nastiness.\\" Despite such negative contemporary reviews of the film, more recent critics and film historians have expressed admiration for Tierney's intense performance and identified the production as a quintessential example of film noir, in particular of RKO's approach to the genre. Tierney attacking Elisha Cook Jr. in the film noir Born to Kill (1947) Yet, in reflecting on his career, Tierney himself maintained he did not like playing such violent roles: Following Born to Kill, Tierney was periodically cast in more sympathetic roles. In RKO's 1948 release Bodyguard, based on a story co-written by Robert Altman and George W. George, he plays a man wrongly accused of murder. That year RKO also announced its intentions to star him in The Clay Pigeon, but Bill Williams was instead assigned the leading role. ===Post-RKO=== Tierney in 1950 was cast by Eagle-Lion Films to star in Kill or Be Killed, directed by Max Nosseck, who had also directed Dillinger. That same year, however, Tierney only received second billing in Joseph Pevney's Shakedown, although in 1951 he returned to a starring role in another film produced by Eagle Lion and directed by Nosseck: The Hoodlum. He then returned to RKO to play a supporting role, performing again as Jesse James in Best of the Badmen (1951). After co-starring in The Bushwhackers (1952), director Cecil B. DeMille cast him as the villain who causes a train wreck in the 1952 Best Picture Oscar-winner The Greatest Show on Earth. Tierney's supporting work in that film earned him a request by the director of Paramount Pictures to put him under contract, but that proposal was dropped by the studio when the actor was once again arrested for fighting in a bar. ===Additional supporting roles and return to the stage=== For the remainder of the 1950s, Tierney continued to work in supporting roles in The Man Behind the Badge, The Steel Cage (1954), and Singing in the Dark (1956). He did share top billing with Kathleen Crowley, John Carradine, and Jayne Mansfield in the low-budget film noir Female Jungle (1956), but as offers of further screen work steadily declined, he returned to the stage, playing Duke Mantee in a touring version of The Petrified Forest alongside Franchot Tone and Betsy von Furstenberg. Gary A. Smith, American International Pictures: The Golden Years, Bear Manor Media 2014 p 30. ===Television=== During the 1950s and 1960s, Tierney also had guest roles in many television series, including Naked City, The Detectives, New York Confidential, Man with a Camera, Adventures in Paradise, Peter Gunn, The Barbara Stanwyck Show, Follow the Sun, Bus Stop, The Lloyd Bridges Show, and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. Among his film roles were parts in John Cassavetes' A Child Is Waiting (1963), Naked Evil (1966), Custer of the West (1967), and Killer Without a Face (1968). After Child is Waiting he moved to France. After several years of living in France, Tierney returned to New York City, but his troubles with the law continued. In New York, he worked as a bartender and construction worker, and drove a horse-drawn carriage in Central Park.\\"Lawrence Tierney: Tough Guy Actor\\", obituary, Variety (Los Angeles, California), March 11-17, 2002, p. 51. ===1970-1982=== According to the book The Films of John Avildsen: Rocky, The Karate Kid and Other Underdogs,Garrett, Tom & Larry Powell. The Films of John Avildsen: Rocky, The Karate Kid and Other Underdogs, McFarland, 2013, Tierney was supposed to have played the role of Joe Curran in Avildsen's 1970 hit Joe but due to an incident two days before principal photography had begun, when he was arrested for assaulting a bartender who refused to serve him any more liquor, he was fired. He occasionally found film work, appearing in a bit part as a security guard in Otto Preminger's Such Good Friends (1971), in Joseph Zito's Abduction (1975), in Andy Warhol's Bad in 1976 (which he later described as \\"a terrible experience‚Äîunprofessional\\"), as well as small roles in Cassavetes' Gloria (1980) and Zito's The Prowler (1981). He was also in The Kirlian Witness (1980), Bloodrage (1980), and Arthur (1981). He was billed second in Midnight (1982). ===Return to Hollywood=== Tierney returned to Hollywood in December 1983, and over the next 12 years, resumed a fairly successful acting career in film and television. He guest-starred on a number of television shows such as Remington Steele, Fame, Hunter, L.A. Law, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and The Simpsons, where former show runner Josh Weinstein called Tierney's appearance \\"the craziest guest star experience we ever had\\".Marge Be Not Proud In 1984, Tierney appeared as part of a national campaign in an Excedrin TV commercial playing a construction worker. In 1985, he had a small speaking role as the chief of the New York City police in John Huston's Prizzi's Honor. Then between 1985 to 1987, Tierney made several guest appearances on the last two seasons of the police drama Hill Street Blues, portraying Desk Sergeant Jenkins working the precinct's night shifts. In fact, he spoke the last line of dialogue on the series' final episode when he answered the front desk phone, uttering \\"Hill Street.\\" Tierney had a more substantial supporting role as the father of protagonist Ryan O'Neal in Norman Mailer's film adaptation of his own novel Tough Guys Don't Dance (1987). He also played a baseball-bat wielding bar owner in the film adaptation of Stephen King's Silver Bullet. Tierney credited Tough Guys Don't Dance in particular with rejuvenating his career. In 1988, Tierney played Cyrus Redblock, a tough holodeck gangster in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"The Big Goodbye\\". Then, in February 1991, he guest-starred as Elaine Benes's gruff father Alton Benes in the Seinfeld episode \\"The Jacket\\". His performance was described as brilliant, and the series' producers contemplated making him a recurring character, but a disturbing incident during production scuttled any such plans. According the show‚Äòs principal cast members, Tierney was caught stealing a knife from a service table on set and hiding it under a trench coat lying over his shoulder. When Jerry Seinfeld confronted him about the theft, Tierney reportedly gestured with the knife toward the star in simulated but threatening manner. Such behavior made it clear to cast and crew that the veteran actor would not be invited back to reprise the role.Seinfeld (Season 02, Episode 04), minute 10:18 onward. ===Reservoir Dogs=== In 1991, Quentin Tarantino cast him in a supporting role as crime lord Joe Cabot in Reservoir Dogs. The success of the film bookended Tierney's career in playing gangsters. In an homage to his first starring role, Tierney reports that one of his henchmen was \\"dead as Dillinger\\". During production, Tierney's off- screen antics both amused and disturbed the cast and crew. Tarantino later referred to Tierney as \\"a complete lunatic\\" who \\"just needed to be sedated\\", observed him to be \\"personally challenging to every aspect of film-making\\", and said that at the end of his first week of directing Reservoir Dogs they \\"had a blow out and got into a fist fight\\". Despite his reputation as a brawler and being difficult to work with, Tierney remained in steady demand as a character actor in Hollywood until he suffered a mild stroke in 1995 which made him gradually slow his career (he had suffered a previous stroke in 1982). He turned to doing voiceover work on animated features and made occasional appearance in film and television (most of which feature him only sitting) as his health slowly deteriorated until his death. One of Tierney's later roles was an uncredited cameo appearance as Bruce Willis' invalid father in Armageddon (1998) in a short scene which ended up being deleted from the theatrical release version. The same year, his long-time agent, Don Gerler, recounted Tierney's continuing troubles with the law: \\"A few years back [in 1994] I was still bailing him out of jail. He was 75 years old and still the toughest guy in the bar!\\" His final acting role was a small part in the 2000 independent film Evicted, written and directed by his nephew Michael Tierney. ==Off-screen troubles== Tierney's numerous arrests for being drunk and disorderly and jail terms for assault on civilians and lawmen alike took a toll on his career. He was an admitted alcoholic who tried to go sober in 1982 after having a mild stroke, once observing during a 1987 interview that he \\"threw away about seven careers through drink\\". Between 1944 and 1951, Tierney was arrested over 12 times for brawling, frequently for drunkenness. He was jailed for brawling in 1947 and 1949 and drunkenness in 1949 and 1950. His legal troubles included a 90-day jail sentence he served from August to November 1951 for breaking a New York college student's jaw. That year, he was sent to a mental hospital after being found disheveled in a church. He was arrested for assault and battery in 1953 and again in October 1958 for resisting arrest and assaulting two police officers. At the time of his 1958 arrest outside a Manhattan bar, The New York Times reported that he had been arrested six times in California and five in New York on similar charges. In January 1973, he was stabbed in a bar fight on the West Side of Manhattan. Two years later, Tierney was questioned by New York City police in connection with the apparent suicide of a 24-year-old woman who had jumped from the window of her high-rise apartment. Tierney told police \\"I had just gotten there, and she just went out the window.\\" He never was arrested or charged with the young woman's death. The apparent suicide closely resembles the death of Rosa, played by Allene Roberts in the 1951 film The Hoodlum. Tierney‚Äôs Vincent Lubeck, the hoodlum of the title, is suspected of driving Rosa into throwing herself off a roof shortly after talking to Lubeck. During the filming of Reservoir Dogs, Tierney shot at his nephew in a drunken rage, and was arrested and bailed. He was released for a day from the jail to continue filming, as recounted by the film's director Quentin Tarantino in an interview. As a result, Tarantino never again worked with or hired Tierney to act in his films. ==Personal life and death== With much of his career and personal life repeatedly embroiled in legal problems and hampered by chronic alcohol abuse, Tierney elected to never marry. He did, though, father one child, Elizabeth Tierney of Park City, Utah. Both of Tierney's younger brothers preceded him in death, Edward dying in 1983 and Gerard (actor Scott Brady) in 1985. On February 26, 2002, at age 82, Lawrence died in his sleep of pneumonia in a Los Angeles nursing home, where he had been residing for nearly two years. ==Selected filmography== * Gildersleeve on Broadway (1943) as Cab Driver (uncredited) * Government Girl (1943) as FBI Man (uncredited) * The Ghost Ship (1943) as Seaman Louie Parker (uncredited) * The Falcon Out West (1944) as Orchestra Leader (uncredited) * Seven Days Ashore (1944) as Crewman (uncredited) * Youth Runs Wild (1944) as Larry Duncan * Dillinger (1945) as John Dillinger * Those Endearing Young Charms (1945) as Lt.

Volume 3: The Province of Baltimore and the Province of New York, Section 1: Comprising the Archdiocese of New York and the Diocese of Brooklyn, Buffalo and Ogdensburg Together with some Supplementary Articles on Religious Communities of Women.. (New York City: The Catholic Editing Company, 1914), p.294. Its primary mission is to form men for the priesthood in the Catholic Church. It educates men destined to serve within the Archdiocese and other archdioceses and dioceses both in the United States and abroad. Once called the \\"West Point of Seminaries\\" for its thorough education and strict discipline, St. Joseph's Seminary holds a reputation as one of the more prestigious and theologically orthodox Roman Catholic seminaries in the United States. As both a college and seminary, it has been accredited both through Middle States Commission on Higher Education and the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum), respectively. It can, thus, offer the degrees of Master of Divinity and S.T.B. to seminarians who have fulfilled the proper academic requirements. Those who maintain an acceptable grade point average and fulfill other academic requirements are eligible for a Master of Arts. Attached to the seminary is an Institute for Religious Studies which prepares candidates for the diaconate and offers non-seminarians, both laity and clergy, an opportunity to earn a M.A. With the inter-diocesan collaboration from the Diocese of Brooklyn and the Diocese of Rockville Centre, the formation of laity and permanent deacons, as well as the continuing education of priests will be through the Sacred Heart Institute, located at the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception, Huntington, Long Island, New York, beginning in September 2012. The seminary is about 16 miles north of the Cathedral of Saint Patrick in midtown Manhattan. ==History== The Archdiocese of New York had operated seminaries at Fordham (once affiliated with what is now Fordham University) staffed by diocesan and, later, Jesuit priests, and then Troy. In 1896, under Archbishop Michael Corrigan, the seminary was transferred to Yonkers under the charge of the Sulpicians.\\"Sulpicians in the United States\\", Catholic Encyclopedia Originally it was staffed by Sulpicians and diocesan priests. The Seminary hosted Pope John Paul II in 1995 and Pope Benedict XVI on April 19, 2008. They each led an afternoon prayer service and visited with the seminarians. ==Intellectual life== In addition to offering the degrees of M.Div., S.T.B., and M.A., the seminary, through its various chairs, hosts visiting scholars throughout the academic year. Seminarians are given the opportunity to take part in interreligious discussions with students of non-Catholic seminaries of the metropolitan area. Each spring, the seminary publishes The Dunwoodie Review, successor to the early 20th century New York Review (1905-1908). Previously published at least annually and bi-annually from 1961 until 1974, the journal has been annually published since 1990 as a student-managed theological journal whose content is provided by seminary faculty members and students. ==Seminary formation== The seminary's primary mission is to educate men studying for the priesthood. In doing so, it seeks to inculcate a structured schedule of public and private prayer. Besides four years of academic work, students are required to take part in charitable activities. Seminarians pray together three times a day, at Morning and Evening prayers and at Mass. From Monday through Thursday the Blessed Sacrament is exposed for two hours for private adoration by the seminarians. Each year, approved seminarians progress towards the Priesthood by receiving various ecclesiastical ministries and eventually Holy Orders. Those in first year are instituted as Lectors and often receive Candidacy in solemn rites. Those in the second year of study receive the official ministry of Acolyte. The beginning of the fourth year is usually when the order of Deacon is conferred. The archbishop himself ordains archdiocesan seminarians to the Priesthood at the Cathedral of Saint Patrick in May of the final semester. New priests are immediately assigned to serve in a parish. ==Seminary functions== The seminary's main building serves many other archdiocesan functions. The priest personnel board meets weekly. Pre-Cana conferences for those preparing for the sacrament of Matrimony are hosted monthly. Each year around Christmas, the archdiocesan choir performs in the chapel. On campus is one of the archdiocesan tribunals and the studio of ITV. Throughout the year, both days of prayer and days of further education are scheduled for the clergy of the archdiocese. On campus was also the St. John Neumann Seminary Residence and Hall, which in collaboration with St. John's University in Queens offered courses in philosophy equivalent to a B.A. for men studying for the priesthood. Students now attend the Diocese of Brooklyn's Cathedral Seminary House of Formation in Douglaston, Queens, New York. Beginning in August 2012, St. Joseph's Seminary has been the major seminary for the Archdiocese of New York, the Diocese of Brooklyn and the Diocese of Rockville Centre. ==Faculty== ===Rectors=== *Edward R.

An adjunct faculty member in Boston University's London graduate journalism programme, and co-editor of TheatreVoice,Boston University International Programs: Academic faculty including a brief biography of Aleks Sierz. Sierz uses in-yer-face theatre to describe work by young playwrights who present vulgar, shocking, and confrontational material on stage as a means of involving and affecting their audiences. According to Sierz, \\"The big three of in-yer-face theatre are Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill and Anthony Neilson\\"; in listing 14 \\"Other hot shots\\" in \\"Who?\\" on his website, Sierz adds the following qualification: \\"Of course, some writers wrote one or two in-yer-face plays and then moved on. Like all categories, this one can't hope to completely grasp the ever-changing reality of the explosive new writing scene.\\"Aleks Sierz, \\"Who?\\", In-Yer-Face Theatre website. Retrieved 9 June 2008. ==Literary-cultural origins== Simon Gray employs the colloquial slang term in your face to describe contemporary theatre dialogue in his play Japes, which premiered in London, in early February 2001.See Lizzie Loveridge, Review of Japes, CurtainUp, 8 February 2001. In the play, Michael Cartts, a middle-aged author, rages against a new kind of writing that he describes as \\"in your face\\". After watching a new play by a young playwright, Cartts describes the stage characters as follows: Appropriating the slang British spelling used by the band In Yer Face, extending the theatrical contexts exposed in Gray's play Japes, and, as the OED observes, employing the more-frequently-hyphenated adjectival form, Sierz used in yer face in his category \\"in-yer-face theatre\\" as defined in his book of that title. ==Process of critical categorising== The process of appropriating and applying such a pre-existing phrase or concept to describe new theatrical works provides a critical means of \\"categorizing\\" or \\"labelling\\", and some critics have stated, \\"pigeonholing\\", or \\"domesticating\\" (\\"taming\\") them.Susan Hollis Merritt, Pinter in Play: Critical Strategies and the Plays of Harold Pinter (1990; Durham and London: Duke UP, 1995) 5, 9, 225‚Äì28, 326, citing Wardle. The creation of in-yer-face theatre parallels the history of more-prevalently accepted literary-critical coinages by critics like Martin Esslin (Theatre of the Absurd), who extended the existential philosophical concept of the Absurd to drama and theatre in his 1961 book of that title,Martin Esslin, The Theatre of the Absurd, 3rd ed. With a new foreword by the author (1961; New York: Vintage [Knopf], 2004). and Irving Wardle (Comedy of menace), who borrowed the phrase from the subtitle of The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace, by David Campton, in 1958 reviews of productions of Campton's play and of The Birthday Party, by Harold Pinter, applying Campton's subtitle to Pinter's work.Irving Wardle, \\"The Birthday Party\\", Encore 5 (July‚ÄìAug. 1958): 39‚Äì40; rpt. in The Encore Reader: A Chronicle of the New Drama, ed.

In summarising the results of the conference, co-conveners Graham Saunders and Rebecca D'Mont√© observe that Sierz acknowledged that by 2002 \\"in-yer-face theatre\\" had already become an historical phenomenon (a trend of the past; hence, pass√©), going on to state: Another conference report, published by Writernet, states: \\"to be shackled to a specific era or genre places a responsibility on a play and creates expectations before a reading or performance. In essence, it disrupts the artistic integrity through preconceived notions of a play because of a simplified label. Plays and playwrights risk being annexed or 'ghetto-ised' when given a superficial monolithic focus.\\"\\"In-Yer-Face?

SASEs are used when communicating with companies, charities or celebrities (for fan post), in cases where each recipient can afford the cost of a single stamp and envelope, but it would be a burden on the organization to pay for the postage on all the letters it sends out. One of the most common uses is when companies are legally required to send something upon request, such as a \\"winners list\\" at the end of a sweepstakes; the company will require a SASE to be included with the request to avoid paying postage. SASEs are also vital in the hobbies of autograph collecting and amateur radio. An enthusiast will send an autograph request to a celebrity or athlete through the mail and include a SASE, which the celebrity or athlete will use to return the autographed item. In the case of amateur radio, operators will send a SASE when requesting another station's QSL card. ==Alternatives== In Japan, return postcards are used for similar purposes. SASEs cannot easily be used for international mail, since senders rarely have supplies of mint foreign stamps. Instead, international reply coupons (IRCs) can be purchased at post offices, although they are no longer sold in some countries, including the United States. Users of IRCs will often, as a courtesy, also send a self-addressed envelope to save the receiver the cost and time of buying and labeling an envelope. == See also == * Freepost, also called Reply paid or Business reply mail * Envelope stuffing == References == Category:Envelopes Category:Postal system ","title":"Self-addressed stamped envelope"},{"id":"1427502","text":"A tournament is a directed graph (digraph) obtained by assigning a direction for each edge in an undirected complete graph. That is, it is an orientation of a complete graph, or equivalently a directed graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a directed edge with any one of the two possible orientations. Many of the important properties of tournaments were first investigated by in order to model dominance relations in flocks of chickens. Current applications of tournaments include the study of voting theory and social choice theory among other things. The name tournament originates from such a graph's interpretation as the outcome of a round-robin tournament in which every player encounters every other player exactly once, and in which no draws occur. In the tournament digraph, the vertices correspond to the players. The edge between each pair of players is oriented from the winner to the loser. If player a beats player b, then it is said that a dominates b. If every player beats the same number of other players (indegree = outdegree), the tournament is called regular. == Paths and cycles == This implies that a strongly connected tournament has a Hamiltonian cycle (Camion 1959). More strongly, every strongly connected tournament is vertex pancyclic: for each vertex v, and each k in the range from three to the number of vertices in the tournament, there is a cycle of length k containing v., Theorem 1. Moreover, if the tournament is 4‚Äëconnected, each pair of vertices can be connected with a Hamiltonian path (Thomassen 1980). == Transitivity == A transitive tournament on 8 vertices. A tournament in which ((a \\\\rightarrow b) and (b \\\\rightarrow c)) \\\\Rightarrow (a \\\\rightarrow c) is called transitive. In other words, in a transitive tournament, the vertices may be (strictly) totally ordered by the edge relation, and the edge relation is the same as reachability. ===Equivalent conditions=== The following statements are equivalent for a tournament T on n vertices: # T is transitive. # T is a strict total ordering. # T is acyclic. # T does not contain a cycle of length 3. # The score sequence (set of outdegrees) of T is \\\\\\\\{0,1,2,\\\\ldots,n-1\\\\\\\\}. # T has exactly one Hamiltonian path. ===Ramsey theory=== Transitive tournaments play a role in Ramsey theory analogous to that of cliques in undirected graphs. In particular, every tournament on n vertices contains a transitive subtournament on 1+\\\\lfloor\\\\log_2 n\\\\rfloor vertices.. The proof is simple: choose any one vertex v to be part of this subtournament, and form the rest of the subtournament recursively on either the set of incoming neighbors of v or the set of outgoing neighbors of v, whichever is larger. For instance, every tournament on seven vertices contains a three-vertex transitive subtournament; the Paley tournament on seven vertices shows that this is the most that can be guaranteed . However, showed that this bound is not tight for some larger values of n. proved that there are tournaments on n vertices without a transitive subtournament of size 2+2\\\\lfloor\\\\log_2 n\\\\rfloor Their proof uses a counting argument: the number of ways that a k-element transitive tournament can occur as a subtournament of a larger tournament on n labeled vertices is :\\\\binom{n}{k}k!2^{\\\\binom{n}{2}-\\\\binom{k}{2}}, and when k is larger than 2+2\\\\lfloor\\\\log_2 n\\\\rfloor, this number is too small to allow for an occurrence of a transitive tournament within each of the 2^{\\\\binom{n}{2}} different tournaments on the same set of n labeled vertices. ===Paradoxical tournaments=== A player who wins all games would naturally be the tournament's winner. However, as the existence of non-transitive tournaments shows, there may not be such a player. A tournament for which every player loses at least one game is called a 1-paradoxical tournament. More generally, a tournament T=(V,E) is called k-paradoxical if for every k-element subset S of V there is a vertex v_0 in V\\\\setminus S such that v_0 \\\\rightarrow v for all v \\\\in S. By means of the probabilistic method, Paul Erd≈ës showed that for any fixed value of k, if V \\\\geq k^22^k\\\\ln(2+o(1)), then almost every tournament on V is k-paradoxical. On the other hand, an easy argument shows that any k-paradoxical tournament must have at least 2^{k+1}-1 players, which was improved to (k+2)2^{k-1}-1 by Esther and George Szekeres (1965). There is an explicit construction of k-paradoxical tournaments with k^24^{k-1}(1+o(1)) players by Graham and Spencer (1971) namely the Paley tournament. ===Condensation=== The condensation of any tournament is itself a transitive tournament. Thus, even for tournaments that are not transitive, the strongly connected components of the tournament may be totally ordered., Corollary 5b. ==Score sequences and score sets== The score sequence of a tournament is the nondecreasing sequence of outdegrees of the vertices of a tournament. The score set of a tournament is the set of integers that are the outdegrees of vertices in that tournament. Landau's Theorem (1953) A nondecreasing sequence of integers (s_1, s_2, \\\\cdots, s_n) is a score sequence if and only if : # 0 \\\\le s_1 \\\\le s_2 \\\\le \\\\cdots \\\\le s_n # s_1 + s_2 + \\\\cdots + s_i \\\\ge {i \\\\choose 2}, \\\\mbox{for }i = 1, 2, \\\\cdots, n - 1 # s_1 + s_2 + \\\\cdots + s_n = {n \\\\choose 2}. Let s(n) be the number of different score sequences of size n. The sequence s(n) starts as: 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 9, 22, 59, 167, 490, 1486, 4639, 14805, 48107, ... Winston and Kleitman proved that for sufficiently large n: :s(n) > c_1 4^n n^{-{5 \\\\over 2}}, where c_1 = 0.049. Tak√°cs later showed, using some reasonable but unproven assumptions, that :s(n) < c_2 4^n n^{-{5 \\\\over 2}}, where c_2 < 4.858. Together these provide evidence that: :s(n) \\\\in \\\\Theta (4^n n^{-{5 \\\\over 2}}). Here \\\\Theta signifies an asymptotically tight bound. Yao showed that every nonempty set of nonnegative integers is the score set for some tournament. == Majority relations == In social choice theory, tournaments naturally arise as majority relations of preference profiles.Brandt, Felix and Brill, Markus and Harrenstein, Paul, \\"Tournament Solutions\\". Chapter 3 in: Let A be a finite set of alternatives, and consider a list P = (\\\\succ_1, \\\\dots, \\\\succ_n) of linear orders over A. We interpret each order \\\\succ_i as the preference ranking of a voter i. The (strict) majority relation \\\\succ_{\\\\text{maj}} of P over A is then defined so that a \\\\succ_{\\\\text{maj}} b if and only if a majority of the voters prefer a to b, that is \\\\\\\\{ i \\\\in [n] : a \\\\succ_i b \\\\\\\\} > \\\\\\\\{ i \\\\in [n] : b \\\\succ_i a \\\\\\\\}. If the number n of voters is odd, then the majority relation forms the dominance relation of a tournament on vertex set A. By a lemma of McGarvey, every tournament on m vertices can be obtained as the majority relation of at most m(m-1) voters. Results by Stearns and Erd≈ës & Moser later established that \\\\Theta(m/\\\\log m) voters are needed to induce every tournament on m vertices. Laslier (1997) studies in what sense a set of vertices can be called the set of \\"winners\\" of a tournament. This revealed to be useful in Political Science to study, in formal models of political economy, what can be the outcome of a democratic process.Austen-Smith, D. and J.

Blasewitz, Loschwitz and Wei√üer Hirsch form the core of a bigger city area which is known as Germany's largest coherent urban territory architecturally dominated by historic villas. As well as nearby quarters as Wachwitz and Kleinzschachwitz, they were all struck in World War II by the allied bombings but much less than others located closer to the city center. The destruction of whole streets ended at the street Fetscherstra√üe, which denotes the beginning of the described villa area. It is the biggest but not the only one of its kind in Dresden. Schillerplatz and Blue Wonder, around 1910 Blasewitz was first mentioned in 1349. The village of fishermen and wine- growers developed into a suburb of Dresden in the Gr√ºnderzeit. Reasonably low taxes made it a popular residence for the wealthy until its incorporation. Its main square is Schillerplatz, site of a movie theatre and Schillergalerie mall. Nearby is the Heilig-Geist-Kirche parish church, which was built in Neo- Gothic style in 1893 according to plans by Karl Emil Scherz. Friedrich Schiller eternalized Blasewitz in his play Wallensteins Lager where Justine Renner says: \\"Was der Blitz, das ist ja die Gustl von Blasewitz!\\" (Like the lightning that is the Gustl from Blasewitz). The Gymnasium Kreuzschule which was first mentioned in 1216, and is thus almost as old as Dresden, has been located in Striesen/Blasewitz since 1945. The Carl Maria von Weber Gymnasium and the Dresden International School are in Blasewitz as well, as was the Martin Andersen Nexoe Gymnasium high school until it moved to Striesen in 2008. The Waldpark municipal forestry park provides recreational facilities with tennis courts. The quarter on the river is home to the rowing center of TU Dresden. There are a number of hostels and restaurants accompanied with a station of S√§chsische Dampfschiffahrt. The areas in proximity to the river, particularly east of the Blue Wonder/ Blaues Wunder bridge, were badly affected by so far all-time record floods which hit Dresden and surroundings in 2002. Purported due to large-scale flood protection measures Dresden largely and Blasewitz almost completely escaped the high tide of the Elbe in 2013.

He completed his academic training in Strasbourg and Basel. After working as a teacher in the Cistercian convent of St. Urban, he returned to Basel, where he worked as a proofer in the shop of Johann Froben, the most important Basel printer of the early 16th Century. In addition, he taught at the Basel Latin school from 1526. After 1537 Oporinus taught Greek at the University of Basel. In 1542 he resigned his academic post to devote himself full-time to his printing workshop. In addition, he completed a medical studies and was temporarily famulus to the iconoclastic physician Paracelsus. He is said to have married the widow of the publisher Johan Hervagius the younger (died 1564).H. Klemm, Beschreibender Catalog des Bibliographischen Museums (H. Klemm's Verlag, Dresden 1884), pp. 232-33. He died deeply in debt. His manuscript collection and his extensive correspondence are preserved in the Basel University Library. == Publications == After a Latin version of Gesta Danorum in 1534, entitled Saxonis grammatici Danorum historiae libri XVI, in 1542/43 he made the first edition of the Latin Koran edited by Theodor Bibliander (the first printed Koran worldwide) from a translation made by Robert of Ketton in Spain between 1142 and 1143 by command of Peter the Venerable, which caused Oporinus serious difficulties. The Basel city council wanted to prevent the publication but yielded due to the intervention of Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon. The most important publication of his workshop was the anatomical atlas De humani corporis fabrica by the humanist physician Andreas Vesalius, in 1543. In October 1546 a book on the assassination of the Spanish Protestant Juan D√≠az, entitled Historia vera de morti sancti viri Ioannis Diazii Hispanics [...] by Claudium Senarclaeum, was published by his workshop, which is attributed to Francisco de Enzinas. In addition, his press published numerous polemical theological works, classics, and historiographical works. His fine knowledge of ancient languages served the quality of consistently correct textual editions. Oporinus later printed a work on church history by Matthias Flacius Illyricus: Catalogus testium veritatis (1556) and the first eleven (1559‚Äì1567) of Wigand's thirteen Magdeburg Centuries. In 1559 he published the complete editio princeps of Diodorus Siculus' Bibliotheca historica. == Oporinus' mark == Looking at title page or at colophon of an Oporinus edition, the printer's device is striking. It shows the mythological lyre player Arion of Lesbos, which is supported by a Dolphin on the sea. There are more variant forms of it.

A normally open (') contact pair is open (in a non-conductive state) when it, or the device operating it, is in a deenergized state or relaxed state. ==Contact form== The National Association of Relay Manufacturers and its successor, the Relay and Switch Industry Association define 23 distinct forms of electrical contact found in relays and switches.Section 1.6, Engineers' Relay Handbook, 5th ed, Relay and Switch Industry Association, Arlington, VA; 3rd ed, National Association of Relay Manufacturers, Elkhart Ind., 1980; 2nd Ed. Hayden, New York, 1966; large parts of the 5th edition are on line here . Of these contact forms, the following are particularly common: ===Form A contacts=== Form A contacts (\\"make contacts\\") are normally open contacts. The contacts are open when the energizing force (magnet or relay solenoid) is not present. When the energizing force is present, the contact will close. An alternate notation for Form A is SPST-NO. ===Form B contacts=== Form B contacts (\\"break contacts\\") are normally closed contacts. Its operation is logically inverted from Form A. An alternate notation for Form B is SPST-NC. ===Form C contacts=== A small relay using a Form C contacts Form C contacts (\\"change over\\" or \\"transfer\\" contacts) are composed of a normally closed contact pair and a normally open contact pair that are operated by the same device; there is a common electrical connection between a contact of each pair that results in only three connection terminals. These terminals are usually labelled as normally open, common, and normally closed (NO-C-NC). An alternate notation for Form C is SPDT. These contacts are quite frequently found in electrical switches and relays as the common contact element provides a mechanically economical method of providing a higher contact count. ===Form D contacts=== Form D contacts (\\"continuity transfer\\" contacts) differ from Form C in only one regard, the make-break order during transition. Where Form C guarantees that, briefly, both connections are open, Form D guarantees that, briefly, all three terminals will be connected. This is a relatively uncommon configuration. ===Form K contacts=== Form K contacts (center-off) differ from Form C in that there is a center-off or normally-open position where neither connection is made. SPDT toggle switches with a center off position are common, but relays with this configuration are relatively rare. ===Form X contacts=== Toggle switch with one Form X contact. When actuated, the moving contact swings left to bridge the gap between the two fixed contacts. Form X or double-make contacts are equivalent to two Form A contacts in series, mechanically linked and operated by a single actuator, and can also be described as SPST-NO contacts. These are commonly found in contactors and in toggle switches designed to handle high power inductive loads. ===Form Y contacts=== Form Y or double-break contacts are equivalent to two Form B contacts in series, mechanically linked and operated by a single actuator, and can also be described as SPST-NC contacts. ===Form Z contacts=== Form Z or double-make double-break contacts are comparable to Form C contacts, but they almost always have four external connections, two for the normally open path and two for the normally closed path. As with forms X and Y, both current paths involve two contacts in series, mechanically linked and operated by a single actuator. Again, this is also described as an SPDT contact. ===Make break order=== Types of make and break Where a switch contains both normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC) contacts, the order in which they make and break may be significant. In most cases, the rule is break-before-make or B-B-M; that is, the NO and NC contacts are never simultaneously closed during the transition between states. This is not always the case, Form C contacts follow this rule, while the otherwise equivalent Form D contacts follow the opposite rule, make before break. The less common configuration, when the NO and NC contacts are simultaneously closed during the transition, is make-before-break or M-B-B. ==Electrical ratings== Contacts are rated for the current carrying capacity while closed and the voltage breaking capacity when opening (due to arcing) or while open. Opening voltage rating may be an A.C. voltage rating, D.C. voltage rating or both. ==Arc snuffing== Contacts of a high-voltage switch employing open air as an insulating medium When relay contacts open to interrupt a high current with an inductive load, a voltage spike will result, striking an arc across the contacts. If the voltage is high enough, an arc may be struck even without an inductive load. Regardless of how the arc forms, it will persist until the current through the arc falls to the point too low to sustain it. Arcing damages the electrical contacts, and a sustained arc may prevent the open contacts from removing power from the system being controlled. In AC systems, where the current passes through zero twice for each cycle, all but the most energetic arcs are extinguished at the zero crossing. The problem is more severe with DC where such zero crossings do not occur. This is why contacts rated for one voltage for switching AC frequently have a lower voltage rating for DC.Chapter 4, Volume IV, Lessons in Electric Circuits, EETech Media, retrieved June 2017. ==Materials== Contacts can be produced from a wide variety of materials. Typical materials include: * Silver alloys * Gold * Platinum-group metals * Carbon ==Electrical contact theory== Ragnar Holm contributed greatly to electrical contact theory and application. Macroscopically smooth and clean surfaces are microscopically rough and, in air, contaminated with oxides, adsorbed water vapor, and atmospheric contaminants. When two metal electrical contacts touch, the actual metal-to- metal contact area is small compared to the total contact-to-contact area physically touching. In electrical contact theory, the relatively small area where electrical current flows between two contacts is called the a-spot where \\"a\\" stands for asperity. If the small a-spot is treated as a circular area and the resistivity of the metal is homogeneous, then the current and voltage in the metal conductor has spherical symmetry and a simple calculation can relate the size of the a-spot to the resistance of the electrical contact interface. If there is metal-to-metal contact between electrical contacts, then the electrical contact resistance, or ECR (as opposed to the bulk resistance of the contact metal) is mostly due to constriction of the current through a very small area, the a-spot. For contact spots of radii smaller than the mean free path of electrons \\\\lambda, ballistic conduction of electrons occurs, resulting in a phenomenon known also as Sharvin resistance. Contact force or pressure increases the size of the a-spot which decreases the constriction resistance and the electrical contact resistance. When the size of contacting asperities becomes larger than the mean free path of electrons, Holm-type contacts become the dominant transport mechanism, resulting in a relatively low contact resistance. ==See also== * Contact bounce * Latching relay * Wetting current * Wetting voltage * Electrical splice ==References== ==Further reading== * (NB.

View from the meadow, looking across the Merton Field sports fields towards Christ Church Cathedral. Christ Church Meadow is a well-known flood-meadow, and popular walking and picnic spot in Oxford, England. Roughly triangular in shape, it is bounded by the River Thames (the stretch through Oxford being known as \\"The Isis\\"), the River Cherwell, and Christ Church. The meadow provides access to many of the college boat houses which are on an island at the confluence of the two rivers. The lower sections of the meadow, close to the Thames, are grazed by cattle, while the upper sections have sports fields. Broad Walk is at the northern edge with Merton Field to the north and Merton College, dominated by the tower of Merton College Chapel, beyond that. Christ Church Meadow is owned by Christ Church, and is thus the private property of the college, however access is allowed during the day. Access starts very early to allow rowers to go to the boathouses. Eights Week and Torpids, Oxford University's two main rowing events, and Christ Church Regatta are held on the Thames here. In past times, ornamental wooden barges were moored on the river here to store boats and house spectators. However these have all now been replaced by boathouses. The meadow can be accessed from St Aldate's to the northwest via Broad Walk through the Christ Church War Memorial Garden, from the north in Merton Street via Grove Walk and Merton Walk, and from the eastern end of the High Street via Rose Lane near the Oxford Botanic Garden to the northeast. There is also lesser used access from near the Head of the River public house by Folly Bridge on the River Thames to the southwest, connecting to Poplar Walk (created by Henry Liddell in 1872) and the path by the river. All entrances are via railinged gates that are locked at night. James Sadler made the first ascent in a balloon by an Englishman from the Meadow on 4 October 1784. The balloon rose to a height of around 3,600 feet and landed six miles away near the village of Wood Eaton near Islip to the north-east of Oxford. A plaque notes the event. The Meadow was also the location where the medieval royal pretender, John Deydras, claimed to have been persuaded by the devil to impersonate Edward II in 1318. Postwar development planned for central Oxford included a relief road passing through the meadow and joining the district of St Ebbe's. The proposal was finally defeated in 1971 after vigorous opposition. ==Gallery== File:The Christ Church Meadow adjacent to the Meadow Building.jpgThe Meadow Building of Christ Church as seen from Broad Walk on the far northwestern corner of the Christ Church Meadow.

It is the capital of the district of Pinneberg and has a population of 42,301 inhabitants. Pinneberg is located 18 km northwest of the city centre of Hamburg. Near Pinneberg is the transmission site for the maritime weather radioteletype and radiofax service DDH47, working on 147.3 kHz. A T-aerial is used, strung between two guyed masts. ==History== When a castle was first built in Pinneberg around the year 1200 AD, the site had already been used as a Germanic Thingst√§tte for several centuries. In 1370 the castle was captured by Count Adolf VIII of Schauenburg and Holstein-Pinneberg. In 1397 Pinneberg was first mentioned in official documents as a seat of courts. In 1472 a Renaissance castle was built in place of the old castle. It was heavily damaged in the years 1627 and 1657 and was finally torn down in 1720. Between 1765 and 1767 the Drostei was built for the Drost Hans von Ahlefeldt. This brick building, which was probably erected by Ernst Georg Sonnin, is the most important example of Baroque architecture in the district of Pinneberg. After some servants and craftsmen had settled in the vicinity of the castle, the settlement expanded slowly, only receiving municipal rights in 1875, although it had been the seat of the Danish ‚ÄòLanddrost‚Äô since 1640 and seat of the Prussian district administrator since 1866 within the Province of Schleswig-Holstein. In 1905 the settlement of ‚ÄòPinneberger Dorf‚Äô was incorporated and in 1927 the villages of Thesdorf and Waldenau followed. After World War II the number of inhabitants of Pinneberg doubled because of the forced immigration of expellees, predominantly from East Prussia.

It was introduced into service in 1918 by the German Army during World War I as the primary weapon of the Sturmtruppen, assault groups specialized in trench combat. Although MP 18 production ended in the 1920s, its design formed the basis of most submachine guns manufactured between 1920 and 1960. ==History== Theodor Bergmann trade mark What became known as the \\"submachine gun\\" had its genesis in the early 20th century and developed around the concepts of fire and movement and infiltration tactics, specifically for the task of clearing trenches of enemy soldiers, an environment within which engagements were unlikely to occur beyond a range of a few feet. In 1915, the German Rifle Testing Commission at Spandau decided to develop a new weapon for trench warfare. An attempt to modify existing semi- automatic pistols, specifically the Luger and C96 Mauser failed, as accurate aimed fire in full automatic mode was impossible due to their light weight and high rate of fire of 1,200 rounds per minute. The Commission determined that a completely new kind of weapon was needed. Hugo Schmeisser, working for the Bergmann Waffenfabrik was part of a team composed of Theodor Bergmann and a few other technicians. They designed a new type of weapon to fulfill the requirements, which was designated the Maschinenpistole 18/I. It is not clear whether the 'I' stands for the number 1 or the letter I, although its successor, the MP28, was designated the Maschinenpistole 28/II (suggesting the former). Full-scale production began in early 1918. Though technically not the world's first submachine gun, being beaten by the double-barreled Italian Villar-Perosa of 1915, in modern usage of the term the MP 18 is considered the world's first submachine gun since the Villar Perosa had been designed to be used as a light machine gun on aircraft before it was adapted to infantry use as a single-barreled shoulder-fired weapon (the Beretta SMG) in late 1918. ===Service history=== A German soldier with an MP 18 in Northern France, 1918 The MP 18 served in the final stages of World War I in 1918, especially in the Kaiserschlacht offensive. More than 25,000 were produced, until the Treaty of Versailles banned production of military SMG in 1920. The MP 18 proved to be an excellent weapon. Its concept was well-proven in trench fighting. The basic design directly influenced later submachine gun designs and showed its superiority over the regular infantry rifle in urban, mobile, and guerrilla warfare. The MP 18 served with German police and paramilitary forces after the end of the war. It was widely used in combat by the Freikorps Von Epp against the Spartacus League in Bavaria and by other Freikorps in Berlin, where its efficiency in urban combat was demonstrated. All the limited conflicts between 1920 and 1940 saw an increasing use of this new class of weapons, first in South America during the Chaco War, then in Europe during the Spanish Civil War, and in China during the Warlord Era and the Japanese invasion, where its use by well-trained Chinese troops was costly for the invaders as in the Battle of Shanghai. It was also used during World War II by various partisans and resistance forces. Since the treaty allowed the Weimar Republic to keep a small quantity of submachine guns for police use, a few hundred MP 18.1s were modified to accept Schmeisser's original 20-round magazine design. This modification, conducted by Haenel Waffenfabrik, required removal of the existing magazine well collar, and replacement with a different one. These weapons were overstamped with the date \\"1920\\" on the receiver and magazine well to show they were legitimate weapons owned by the Weimar Republic and not war bringbacks or clandestine weapons. Bergmann sold the licence of the MP 18. 1 to SIG Switzerland; the Swiss made model was known as SIG Bergmann 1920. It existed in .30 Luger and 7.63 mm Mauser. The Bergmann MP 18.1 represents a milestone both in terms of armament technology and warfare tactics. It opened the way for a whole new class of weapons and triggered the research for lighter automatic firearms to be used by mobile troops. Its first direct competitors did not see service in World War I, but most of them saw use in all the limited conflicts taking place in the inter-war period. ===Evolution=== A French-made STA Mod√®le 1924 The French, despite being moderately interested by this class of armament because they had designed and introduced in service many semi-automatic and automatic weapons, immediately launched studies based on captured MP 18s. The design of the STA 1922 was adopted and the MAS 1924 or 9mm STA Mod√®le 1924 entered service and was used in colonial conflicts in Morocco. Around 1,000 were produced and these rifles, as well as ex-German captured MP 18, saw limited service during World War II. Tsing Tao, China, 1927 The Chinese produced a modified MP 18 in Tsing Tao with the assistance of Heinrich Vollmer. The MP 28 was produced by C. G. Haenel under the supervision of Hugo Schmeisser. The MP 28 was produced under license by Etablissements Pieper in Belgium. It was copied by the Second Spanish Republic under the codename Naranjero. The Naranjero was chambered in 9mm Largo. The Austrian Steyr MP 34 was created by a team of technicians led by Louis Stange who designed a submachine gun for Rheinmetall in 1919 and used Bergmann's MG 15 to design the MG 30. The SIG Bergmann 1920 was used by Finland, Japan, and Estonia, it was the inspiration for the Estonian Tallinn 1923, the Japanese Type 100 submachine gun and the Finnish Suomi model 31, which in turn inspired Degtyarev for his PPD 34. Emil Bergmann, Theodor Bergmann's son designed the MP 32 that evolved into the MP34 as adopted by Denmark before to receive the MP35 name when adopted by nascent Wehrmacht in 1935. This submachine gun is often mistaken with the Mitraillette 34, a MP28 made in Belgium by Pieper Bayard, former Bergmann licensed manufacturer or with the MP34 made by Steyr. It is easy to identify the Bergmann MP 32/34/35 or its final version 35/1 since the cocking lever works exactly like a rifle bolt. In 1940, with a pressing need for individual automatic weapons, the British copied the MP 28 and developed the Lanchester submachine gun for the Royal Navy. Solidly built with the use of brass for the magazine well, and a bayonet mount, it entered service in 1940. The magazine and the bolt of the MP 28 could be used in the Lanchester. The British Sten used the side-mounted magazine configuration and a simplified version of the open-bolt firing operating system of the MP28. The OVP 1918, an offspring of Revelli's Villar Perosa 1915, inspired Heinrich Vollmer for his telescopic bolt used in the VPM 1930, EMP, MP 38, MP 40 and MP 41. The MP 18 remained in limited service with the German armed forces during the Second World War, specifically with the Sicherheitsdienst, later eastern foreign divisions of the Waffen SS and also with Kriegsmarine coastal artillery units. The Soviet Union made a similar use of MP 28 design in their PDD-34 sub machine gun in 1934. Further development of the PPD-34 led to the simplified PPD-40 and PPSh-41. ==Design details== The MP 18 was a heavy weapon, weighing over when fully loaded. The receiver tube was very thick (~3 mm), compared with later World War II submachine guns with half that thickness or less, such as the Sten gun or MP 40. TM 08 magazine for Bergmann MP 18.1 Though Schmeisser designed a conventional 20-round-capacity \\"box\\" magazine for the weapon, the Testing Commission, for practical reasons, insisted that the MP 18 be adapted to use the 32-round TM 08 Luger \\"snail\\" drum magazine that was widely used with the long-barreled version of the Luger pistol. Ladeger√§t (loading appliance) for the TM 08 magazine Like many other open-bolt designs, the MP 18 was prone to accidental discharge. If the buttstock of a loaded gun was given a hard knock while the bolt was fully forward, the gun could accidentally fire because of the bolt overcoming the action spring resistance and moving rearward enough to pick up a round, chamber it and fire. Soldiers liked to leave the bolt of their firearm in this closed or forward position, so dirt and debris would not enter the barrel and chamber. This 'Bolt-closure' practice acted as a dust cover for the weapon's chamber, preventing a malfunction from occurring because of the presence of foreign debris, but making accidental discharge more likely. post World War I MP 18 with universal safety The German police asked for an external safety on their MP 18s, and a universal bolt-locking safety was added on all the submachine guns used by the police. Later submachine gun designs like the Sten and the MP 40 were modified to allow the cocking handle to be pushed inwards to lock the closed bolt to the tubular receiver casing. This design change prevented accidental discharges when the bolt was left forward and a loaded magazine was inserted. ==Operation== loading a TM 08 The MP 18 submachine gun is a simple blowback operated weapon firing from the open bolt. The original MP 18.1 was designed to use the snail drum magazine of the Luger Artillery model pistol. This rotary design type of magazine holds 32 rounds of 9 mm Parabellum, the user having to load the magazine with a proprietary loading tool. A special sleeve was required when the snail drum was used on the MP 18 to stop the snail drum from being inserted too far in the magazine well. After 1920, the MP 18 was modified to use a straight magazine similar to those used in the later developed MP 40 submachine gun. The MP 18 could only fire in the fully automatic mode. Its successor, the MP 28/2, received a modified mechanism with a selector for single shot or fully automatic fire. == Users == Members of the Alberta Provincial Police in Canada with an MP18 and Lewis gun (1920s) *: MP-28 produced under license and adopted as MI-34 (Mitraillette Mod√®le 1934) *: MP-28 *: Some evidence that captured MP 18s in use with Alberta Provincial Police *: Used Swiss-made SIG M/20 in 7.63√ó25mm Mauser and used against the Chinese *: 1,523 SIG M/20s in 7.65√ó21mm Luger were bought between 1922 and 1940 * * *: ex-Japanese Swiss-made guns * *: Used locally made versions of the MP 18, MP 28 and Swiss-made SIG Bergmann 1920 in 7.63√ó25mm Mauser *: Korean Liberation Army used in Second Sino-Japanese War received by National Revolutionary Army * *: The Assault Group of the Norwegian Police Service acquired 26 SIG Bergmann 1920 submachine guns in 1937 * *: in 7.65mm *: Large numbers of MP 28/II submachine guns were supplied to the Iron Guard by the Sicherheitsdienst, used by the army after the Iron Guard Rebellion *: MP 28s produced under license *: Used by the police after WWI. ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * ==Further reading== * Clinton Ezell, Edward.

He was schooled in Roskilde and studied from 1496 at the University of Greifswald. He received a baccalaureate degree in 1498 and from 1505 was a canon at Lund Cathedral. He studied at the University of Paris from 1508 to 1515, where in 1511 he received a Master of Arts degree. During his stay in Paris he developed an interest in writing, translating and publishing. At that time Paris was the undisputed capital of the still-new printing press. While considering writing a new Latin-Danish lexicon, he wrote a replacement for the 300-year-old Latin grammar, Doctrinale, written in 1199 by Alexander of Villedieu,Nauert, Charles Garfield, \\"Humanism and the Culture of Renaissance Europe\\" (Cambridge University Press 2006), p.45 and still used as standard in the schools of Denmark at that time. In 1510 he published his new Latin-Danish lexicon, called Vocabularium ad usum Dacorum. ==Gesta Danorum== Title page of Danorum Regum heroumque Historiae, Paris 1514 He wanted to publish the huge 300-year-old chronicle of Denmark, Gesta Danorum, written by Saxo Grammaticus, but he had difficulty in gaining access to a manuscript of the work. At that time the most knowledge of this work came from a summary called Compendium Saxonis located in Chronica Jutensis, dated about 1342. Undoubtedly this is also how Pedersen knew of it. Pedersen began to send letters to friends all over Denmark, trying to locate a manuscript, but they either did not have one or did not want to release it to him. He finally travelled to Denmark to search through libraries and monasteries, but still could not find one. Unexpectedly a letter arrived from Archbishop Birger Gunnersen of Lund stating that he had found a copy in his district and it would be made available to Pedersen. With the help of Jodocus Badius Ascensius (also known as Jodocus Van Asche Badius), whose relationship with Pedersen had now grown to more than just a professional one, they published this first edition, editio princeps, of the Gesta Danorum, titled Danorum Regum heroumque Historiae, 15 March 1514, in Paris. This is today the oldest known complete copy of Saxo‚Äôs Gesta Danorum. ==The later years== In 1516, Pedersen returned to Lund and worked for Archbishop Birger Gunnersen. In 1522, he became Kanzler under the new Archbishop, Johann Wess. However, during the reign of the next Archbishop, Aage Sparre, Pedersen was accused of treason, among other things, resulting in Pedersen leaving for Germany. As he was loyal to King Christian II, he followed him in exile to the Netherlands in 1526, after meeting him in Berlin, where he spent the next five years in the then-Dutch city of Lier. In 1529, he renounced his Catholicism (and his canon status) and became Lutheran. Consequently, Margaret of Austria, Regent of the Low Countries asked Christian II to dismiss him, but the exiled king ignored her request.Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh√°sz, Guido Latr√© (eds.), Tyndale's Testament, Turnhout: Brepols, 2002, , pp. 136-137. He did not return to Denmark before 1532, and got permission to settle in Malm√∏, where he opened a printing press shop. His continued loyalty towards King Christian II gained him no friends among the nobility, and it did not get better when later he actively participated in the Civil War (Grevens Fejde) on the losers' side. He married Else Jacobsdatter in 1534 in Malm√∏, who died during childbirth in 1539. Pedersen sold his printing press shop and moved to Copenhagen in 1541. During these years he translated the Bible to Danish. This was to become his life's work, which sometimes earns him the title \\"the father of Danish literature\\". Finished in 1543, but first published in 1550, this work, Biblia, was not only a masterpiece of translation, but also technically excellent, with good-quality graphics and woodcuts. This is the first complete Danish Bible translation. 3000 copies were printed by Ludwig Dietz. Pedersen was ill during the last 10 years of his life, but he continued to work until his death in 1554, while he was living with relatives in Helsinge. ==Publications== Pedersen's notable works include: *1510, Vocabularium ad usum Dacorum (A Latin-to-Danish Lexicon) *1514, Danorum Regum heroumque Historiae (publishing of Saxo's Gesta Danorum) *1515, \\"J√¶rtegnspostil\\" *1529, \\"Det Ny Testamente\\" (A translation of the New Testament) *1533, \\"N√∏ttelig Legebog faar Fattige och Rige Unge och Gamle\\" (A medical book) *1534, \\"Karl Magnus Kr√∏nike\\" (A free re-write of Charlemagne legends) *1534, \\"Kong Holger Danskes Kr√∏nike\\" (A free re-write based on the French 15th century 'Ogier le Dannoys') *1550, \\"Biblia - Christian d.3.s Bibel\\" (Translation of the Bible,- this is the first complete Danish Bible translation) Additionally, a revised edition of the Danish \\"Rimkr√∏niken\\" and a Danish translation of Saxo‚Äôs \\"Gesta Danorum\\" were produced. It was never published and was lost in the library fire at Copenhagen University in 1728. He has published and/or written many other smaller works. ==References== *Apoteker Sibbernsens Saxobog, C. A.

For a given reaction mechanism, the prediction of the corresponding rate equation (for comparison with the experimental rate law) is often simplified by using this approximation of the rate-determining step. In principle, the time evolution of the reactant and product concentrations can be determined from the set of simultaneous rate equations for the individual steps of the mechanism, one for each step. However, the analytical solution of these differential equations is not always easy, and in some cases numerical integration may even be required.Steinfeld J. I., Francisco J. S., Hase W. L. Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics (2nd ed., Prentice-Hall 1999) ch. 2. The hypothesis of a single rate-determining step can greatly simplify the mathematics. In the simplest case the initial step is the slowest, and the overall rate is just the rate of the first step. Also, the rate equations for mechanisms with a single rate-determining step are usually in a simple mathematical form, whose relation to the mechanism and choice of rate- determining step is clear. The correct rate-determining step can be identified by predicting the rate law for each possible choice and comparing the different predictions with the experimental law, as for the example of and CO below. The concept of the rate-determining step is very important to the optimization and understanding of many chemical processes such as catalysis and combustion. ==Example reaction: + CO== As an example, consider the gas- phase reaction + CO ‚Üí NO + . If this reaction occurred in a single step, its reaction rate (r) would be proportional to the rate of collisions between and CO molecules: r = k[][CO], where k is the reaction rate constant, and square brackets indicate a molar concentration. Another typical example is the Zel'dovich mechanism. ===First step rate-determining=== In fact, however, the observed reaction rate is second-order in and zero-order in CO,Whitten K. W., Galley K. D., Davis R. E. General Chemistry (4th edition, Saunders 1992), p. 638‚Äì639. with rate equation r = k[]2. This suggests that the rate is determined by a step in which two molecules react, with the CO molecule entering at another, faster, step. A possible mechanism in two elementary steps that explains the rate equation is: # + ‚Üí NO + (slow step, rate- determining) # + CO ‚Üí + (fast step) In this mechanism the reactive intermediate species is formed in the first step with rate r1 and reacts with CO in the second step with rate r2. However can also react with NO if the first step occurs in the reverse direction (NO + ‚Üí 2 ) with rate r‚àí1, where the minus sign indicates the rate of a reverse reaction. The concentration of a reactive intermediate such as [] remains low and almost constant. It may therefore be estimated by the steady-state approximation, which specifies that the rate at which it is formed equals the (total) rate at which it is consumed. In this example is formed in one step and reacts in two, so that : \\\\frac{d\\\\ce{[NO3]}}{dt} = r_1 - r_2 - r_{-1} \\\\approx 0. The statement that the first step is the slow step actually means that the first step in the reverse direction is slower than the second step in the forward direction, so that almost all is consumed by reaction with CO and not with NO. That is, r‚àí1 ‚â™ r2, so that r1 ‚àí r2 ‚âà 0. But the overall rate of reaction is the rate of formation of final product (here ), so that r = r2 ‚âà r1. That is, the overall rate is determined by the rate of the first step, and (almost) all molecules that react at the first step continue to the fast second step. ===Pre-equilibrium: if the second step were rate-determining=== The other possible case would be that the second step is slow and rate-determining, meaning that it is slower than the first step in the reverse direction: r2 ‚â™ r‚àí1. In this hypothesis, r1 ‚àí r‚àí1 ‚âà 0, so that the first step is (almost) at equilibrium. The overall rate is determined by the second step: r = r2 ‚â™ r1, as very few molecules that react at the first step continue to the second step, which is much slower. Such a situation in which an intermediate (here ) forms an equilibrium with reactants prior to the rate-determining step is described as a pre- equilibriumPeter Atkins and Julio de Paula, Physical Chemistry (8th ed., W. H. Freeman 2006) p. 814‚Äì815. . For the reaction of and CO, this hypothesis can be rejected, since it implies a rate equation that disagrees with experiment. If the first step were at equilibrium, then its equilibrium constant expression permits calculation of the concentration of the intermediate in terms of more stable (and more easily measured) reactant and product species: :K_1 = \\\\frac{\\\\ce{[NO][NO3]}}{\\\\ce{[NO2]^2}}, :[\\\\ce{NO3}] = K_1 \\\\frac{\\\\ce{[NO2]^2}}{\\\\ce{[NO]}}. The overall reaction rate would then be :r = r_2 = k_2 \\\\ce{[NO3][CO]} = k_2 K_1 \\\\frac{\\\\ce{[NO2]^2 [CO]}}{\\\\ce{[NO]}}, which disagrees with the experimental rate law given above, and so disproves the hypothesis that the second step is rate-determining for this reaction. However, some other reactions are believed to involve rapid pre-equilibria prior to the rate-determining step, as shown below. ==Nucleophilic substitution== Another example is the unimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN1) reaction in organic chemistry, where it is the first, rate-determining step that is unimolecular. A specific case is the basic hydrolysis of tert- butyl bromide () by aqueous sodium hydroxide. The mechanism has two steps (where R denotes the tert-butyl radical ): # Formation of a carbocation R‚àíBr ‚Üí + . # Nucleophilic attack by hydroxide ion + ‚Üí ROH. This reaction is found to be first-order with r = k[R‚àíBr], which indicates that the first step is slow and determines the rate. The second step with OH‚àí is much faster, so the overall rate is independent of the concentration of OH‚àí. In contrast, the alkaline hydrolysis of methyl bromide () is a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction in a single bimolecular step. Its rate law is second-order: r = k[R‚àíBr][]. ==Composition of the transition state== A useful rule in the determination of mechanism is that the concentration factors in the rate law indicate the composition and charge of the activated complex or transition state. For the ‚ÄìCO reaction above, the rate depends on []2, so that the activated complex has composition , with 2 entering the reaction before the transition state, and CO reacting after the transition state. A multistep example is the reaction between oxalic acid and chlorine in aqueous solution: + ‚Üí 2 + 2 + 2 . The observed rate law is :v = k \\\\frac{\\\\ce{[Cl2][H2C2O4]}}{[\\\\ce{H+}]^2[\\\\ce{Cl^-}]}, which implies an activated complex in which the reactants lose 2 + before the rate-determining step. The formula of the activated complex is + ‚àí 2 ‚àí + , or (an unknown number of water molecules are added because the possible dependence of the reaction rate on was not studied, since the data were obtained in water solvent at a large and essentially unvarying concentration). One possible mechanism in which the preliminary steps are assumed to be rapid pre-equilibria occurring prior to the transition state is : + HOCl + + : + :HOCl + ‚Üí + + 2 ==Reaction coordinate diagram== In a multistep reaction, the rate-determining step does not necessarily correspond to the highest Gibbs energy on the reaction coordinate diagram.Keith J. Laidler. Chemical Kinetics (3rd ed., Harper and Row 1987) p. 283‚Äì285. . If there is a reaction intermediate whose energy is lower than the initial reactants, then the activation energy needed to pass through any subsequent transition state depends on the Gibbs energy of that state relative to the lower-energy intermediate. The rate-determining step is then the step with the largest Gibbs energy difference relative either to the starting material or to any previous intermediate on the diagram. Also, for reaction steps that are not first-order, concentration terms must be considered in choosing the rate-determining step. ==Chain reactions== Not all reactions have a single rate-determining step. In particular, the rate of a chain reaction is usually not controlled by any single step. ==Diffusion control== In the previous examples the rate determining step was one of the sequential chemical reactions leading to a product. The rate-determining step can also be the transport of reactants to where they can interact and form the product. This case is referred to as diffusion control and, in general, occurs when the formation of product from the activated complex is very rapid and thus the provision of the supply of reactants is rate-determining. == See also == * Product-determining step ==References== * ==External links== * The Rate- Limiting Enzyme regulation database (RLEdb) Category:Chemical kinetics ja:ÂèçÂøúÈÄüÂ∫¶#ÂæãÈÄüÊÆµÈöé ","title":"Rate-determining step"},{"id":"1427662","text":"Bohicon is a city in Benin, and a conurbation of Abomey lying 9 kilometres east of the city on the railway line from Cotonou to Parakou and on Benin's main highway RNIE 2 which joins the RNIE 4.

Bohicon is an important in communications in Benin and branches to the various departments of the country, including to the north of Benin and on to Niger or Burkina Faso and even Togo or Nigeria. Bohicon is a relatively new city compared to Abomey and Allada and was founded in the 20th century with the installation of the railway station on the Cotonou-Parakou railway and the central market. ==Cityscape and economy== Bohicon traders of textiles such as cushions and matresses Bohicon Mosque The city has a mosque and the Jehovah's Witnesses also have a church in Bohicon.

Bohicon Railway Station is located in the city centre and the main hotel worth mentioning is the Jardin de l'Hotel de Ville De Bohicon which is set in a garden park with a restaurant. Given the excellent road and rail networks that connect to Bohicon, it is an important trade centre that is the third largest in the country after Cotonou and Parakou. Trade is the primary activity of the city and its real name \\"Gboxicon\\" derives from the extensive sheep marketing that takes places in the city, literally meaning \\"market sheep\\". The market is of considerable size and there is a notable drum shop located in Bohicon. The Maquis Malodie market is also known for its cuisine with a number of stalls serving omelette and coffee in the mornings and stacks of pepper and attracts thousands of traders from all over Benin. A speciality sold in the market is afitin (soy dawa-dawa/soy iru), which is traditionally and somewhat famously in Benin made by women in the region. It is a protein-rich fermented food widely used in West Africa as a seasoning. After sheep marketing and the processing of food, industrial handcraft is also important in the local economy including textiles. Thousands of craftsmen and craftswomen produce in the privacy of their workshop products for export. In the surrounding area in Bohicon commune, a number of agricultural crops are produced in subsistence farming including maize, cotton, peanuts and oil, yams, sorghum and cassava many of which are cultivated in plantations. There are also small livestock farms with cattle and goats. In short, trade and transportation alone occupy more than 40% of the population. As an economic effect though, Bohicon faces serious problems with the environment and sanitation due to industrial waste. ==Climate== ==Administration== Bohicon Railway Station Bohicon is one of the 77 official Communes of Benin.

On June 25, 1993, Bosio made the only non-pitching appearance of his career, entering a game against the Chicago White Sox as a pinch runner for Bret Boone; he did not have a plate appearance. Manager Lou Pinella inserted Bosio in the game to qualify as an appearance, so Bosio could subsequently start serving a pending suspension for his involvement in a brawl.

The Rainiers were 2001 co- champions of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and Bosio led their pitching staff to the lowest earned run average in the PCL, working with future-Major Leaguers Brian Fuentes, Brett Tomko, and Joel Pi√±eiro. He also had the most valuable pitcher in Denny Stark, who went 16‚Äì2 with a 2.43 ERA. Bosio also served as an advanced scout for the Mariners during their 116-win season.

On November 2, 2017, Bosio was named the pitching coach for the Detroit Tigers under their new manager, Ron Gardenhire, for the 2018 season. Bosio's contract with the Tigers was terminated on June 27, 2018, due to \\"insensitive comments that violated Club policy and his Uniform Employee Contract.\\" Bosio claimed that the offending comment was referring to relief pitcher Daniel Stumpf, who is white, as a \\"spider monkey\\"‚Äîdue to the faces he makes while lifting weights‚Äîwhich was overheard and misunderstood by an African American clubhouse attendant. However, follow-up reports by the Detroit Free Press and The Athletic contained accounts from multiple eyewitnesses who contradicted Bosio's claim, and Stumpf himself claimed that he had never heard the nickname. ==Personal life== Bosio has two kids, Jensen and Jace. With his ex wife Suzanne; Bosio married Heather Compeau on May 12th 2016.

It is situated west of Coventry, east of Solihull and to the southeast of Birmingham, to which it serves as a prosperous commuter village. It is currently undergoing gradual suburbanisation and is increasingly considered as a small town in terms of its population. The name ‚ÄúBalsall‚Äù comes from the Anglo Saxon word ‚ÄúBaelle‚Äù meaning corner (or angle) of land, and ‚ÄúHeale‚Äù meaning a sheltered place The village is split between the civil parishes of Balsall, which also includes Balsall Street, Temple Balsall, and Fen End, and had a population of 7,039 according to the 2011 census. It also lies on the Heart of England Way. The village is of recent origin; most of the houses and shops were built in the 20th century. Previously, the village consisted of a couple of hamlets of about six to twelve houses each and a few scattered cottages - as shows. In the 1930s, there began the development which linked these isolated buildings, but it was not until after World War II that the village really began to grow. With its close proximity to the village of Meriden away, which until recently was long-believed to be the geographic centre of England, Balsall Common is perceived to be one of the furthest places from the UK coastline. In fact, Coton-in-the-Elms in south Derbyshire holds this designation, situated 23.5 miles (37.8 km) to the north. Nevertheless, Balsall Common's secondary school is named the Heart of England School. The local primary school is named Balsall Common Primary School. It is served by Berkswell railway station (actually in Balsall Common) on the Coventry-Birmingham line, and by bus to Solihull (service S2A/S2C). Other nearby towns and villages include Knowle, Kenilworth, Warwick, Hampton-in- Arden, Berkswell, Barston, Honiley and Hatton. Since the late-1990s, plans for a bypass, a large national supermarket and larger swathes of new housing have so far been circumvented. This is mainly due to Balsall Common being situated at the heart of the West Midlands green belt area known as the Meriden Gap, between Solihull and Coventry, and is thus subject to strict planning regulations. Therefore, the village/town has so far not witnessed rapid growth given its location, as residents had long-feared that the village would act as a population overspill centre for Coventry, Solihull and Birmingham. A new Tesco Metro store opened in December 2014 on Station Road. ==Notable residents== Several Premiership and Championship footballers live (and have lived) in Balsall Common, especially those playing with Birmingham City, Aston Villa and Coventry City. These include John Sillett, Trond Egil Soltvedt, Trevor Francis in the late 1970s, Lee Carsley and Robbie Keane. Other famous sporting residents include, former England cricket captain Bob Wyatt and Wimbledon ladies single champion Maud Watson. Former England international goalkeeper Peter Shilton briefly lived in the village from late-1995 to early 1996, before moving to nearby Burton Green.. Another notable resident is Paddy Doyle, who formerly held numerous fitness and endurance world records.

Khasidei Ashkenaz; \\"German Pietists\\") were a Jewish mystical, ascetic movement in the German Rhineland during the 12th and 13th centuries. ==Background== The leaders of the community of the Ashkenazi Hasidim movement were descended from the Kalonymos family of northern Italy, a family that had immigrated to Germany in the 10th century; and the Abun family of France, among others, according to the sacred books they wrote at the close of the 10th century. Ashkenazi Hasidicism was a social movement known for its strict asceticism and mystical doctrine who radically reimagined Jewish ethics, holding themselves accountable to Din Shamayim (an unwritten Law of Heaven) instead of traditional halachah. Some posit that its theology fits into the general canon of Jewish mysticism. It certainly parallels other Jewish mysticism; however in other ways it was very original. The extent of this community's effect and influence during Middle Age German Judaism has not been studied. ==Prominent members== The line of thought that developed into Ashkenazi Hasidicism traces its roots to the Gaonic scholar Abu Aaron and extended to the three seminal thinkers of the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, Judah the Pious, Samuel the Pious, and Ele√†zar of Worms. Rabbi Judah the Pious (Rav Yehuda Ha-Hassid) of Regensburg was the foremost leader of the Ashkenazi Hasidim. His book Sefer Hasidim (Book of the Pious) is the most significant relic of this movement. He was born in 1150 in Speyer and died in 1217. He was a strong Talmudist and attended Tosafist schools. His experiences as a Tosafist may have contributed to his desperate plea to focus on the practical aspects of the Talmud, the Halacha. He was taught the Kabbala at a young age by his father, Samuel of Speyer (Samuel the Pious). Samuel the Pious is said to have contributed some of the sections in Sefer Hasidim, and as the father and teacher of Judah the Pious, he directly contributed to much of this movement's thought. He authored the Shir Hakavod (\\"Song of the Glory\\"), which poetically describes Ashkenazi Hasidic theology, namely, the presence of the divine glory (kavod ◊õ◊ë◊ï◊ì). He also authored the Book of the Fear of God (Sefer Hayirah) and Book of Repentance (Sefer Hateshuva). Rabbi Eleazar of Worms was a leading Talmudist and Kabbalist in the 13th century and was the prime disciple of Judah the Pious. He is best known for his work, Sefer HaRokeah (Book of the Perfumer), a halakhic guide to ethics and Jewish law for the common reader. His prediction of coming of the messianic age to begin in 1226 and come to fruition in 1240 spread far and wide in Jewish communities. He was the last major member attributed to this movement and died in 1230. ==Theology== The Hasidim's most central tenets concerned the ‚ÄúWill of the Creator‚Äù. They are obligated to follow the Din Shamayim, ‚ÄúLaw of Heaven‚Äù. Their devotion were expressed in both esoteric and perfectionist ways. Their esoteric expression was in their dedication to prayer. They believed that you may rise spiritually toward communion with God through the knowledge of prayer. The theology of the Ashkenazi Hasidim is certainly independent and unique; however, it does contain meaningful similarities to the theologies of both the early kabbalists and of Saadia Gaon. Saadia, in his Book of Beliefs and Opinions (◊ê◊û◊ï◊†◊ï◊™ ◊ï◊ì◊¢◊ï◊™) grapples with the following conundrum: throughout the Tanakh, Prophets frequently describe their visions of the divine realm. These descriptions include majestic images of God sitting on His heavenly throne, surrounded by the heavenly host. Since believing that God has perceivable, physical features is blasphemous for Saadia, he concludes that the visions do not portray God, but rather portray God's created glory. This glory is God's created messenger, his exalted angel, created to give the prophets something concrete to visualize. The torat hakavod (Hebrew ◊™◊ï◊®◊™ ◊î◊õ◊ë◊ï◊ì) of the Ashkenazi Hasidim echoes Saadia's theory, but with a fundamental difference. For the latter, the glory was not created by God, but emanated from God in a similar manner to the way that light emanates from the sun. What emerged is a tripartite system composed of God, the higher Kavod, and the lower Kavod. God is beyond human comprehension and impossible for man to relate to. The higher Kavod emanates from God, and is still very distant from man, but slightly more accessible. And finally, the lower Kavod is the element that man can access. It is at the lower Kavod that man can attempt to understand. This description of God and His divine realm directly parallels the kabbalistic ten-headed sefirotic system, with Ein Sof (Hebrew ◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊°◊ï◊£) beyond knowledge on the top, and the ten sefirot emanating downward; the lower the sefira, the more relatable it becomes. Just as the unity of the sefirot is an indispensable concept in Kabbala, the inter-connectedness of the lower Kavod and higher Kavod is crucial for the Chassidei Ashkenaz. The lower Kavod is not separate from the higher Kavod but instead emanates from it. As in Kabbala, there are many symbols and descriptions used to explain and refer to the Kavod. For example, in various Ashkenazi Hasidic works, the Kavod is referred to by the names of Demut Yakov Chakuk al Kisai HaKavod, Tiferet Yisrael, Kruv, Kisai Hakavod, Atara, Shin, Bas, and Sod. Many of these references are present in \\"Shir Hakavod\\" by Rabbi Samuel the Pious, a poem written in praise of the Kavod. ==Major work== Sefer Hasidim, by Rabbi Judah the Pious, is the most important work of the Chassidei Ashkenaz. The themes depicted within it most significantly portray the religious ideology of the Chassidei Ashkenaz. Sefer Hasidim contains over two thousand stories. Sefer Hasidim are told to individuals gathered around a leader and this leader was called a hasid bakhamor a Pietist Sage. The Pietist, as an individual but even more as a Sage, was existentially responsible for the transgressions of his fellows, indeed for the transgressions of Jewish society as a whole Samuel's son Judah went farther and depicted him as the head of a sect. Two versions of the Sefer Hasidim exist, the Bologna Edition and the Parma MS Edition, and a debate about which one represents an earlier version persists. ==Major themes== The central idea of Sefer Hasidim its that there is a hidden will of God (\\"Ratzon Haborei\\") for his followers well beyond what is prescribed in the written and oral Torah, and the true worshiper of God seeks to fulfill the Ratzon Haborei. ‚ÄúWe have not found it (the Torah) of ample strength (Job 27:23): - the Torah did not express the will of the creator, nor did it address itself to the needs of man.‚Äù Thus, there are an abundance of novel directives present in Sefer Hasidim, each one representing Ratzon Haborei. In fact, Rabbi Judah the Pious stipulates in the introduction to the book that one of his primary goals in writing Sefer Hasidim was to make this hidden will of God accessible to those who wish to find it: > [This book] is written for those who fear God and are mindful of His name. > There is a Hasid whose heart desires, out of love for his creator do His > will, but he is unaware of all these things [i.e. demands]- which thing to > avoid and how to execute profoundly the wish of the Creator. For this > reason, the Sefer Hasidim was written so that all who fear God and those > returning to their Creator with an undivided heart may read it and know and > understand what is incumbent upon them to do and what they must avoid. The quest to fulfill the Ratzon Haborei was not just a commendable, optional one; rather, as the introduction to the book details, it was a requisite aspect of proper divine service: > And we find in the Torah that anyone who was capable of understanding [a > demand] even though he was not [explicitly] commanded is punished for not > realizing [the requirement] on his own. ‚ÄúAnd Moses was angry with the > officers of the army . . . who had come from the service of the war. And he > said to them, ‚ÄòHave you let all the women live?‚Äô‚Äù (Num. 31: 14-15). Why did > they not reply, ‚ÄúYou did not command us, for you did not tell us to kill the > women‚Äù? But Moses knew that they were wise and perspicacious enough to infer > [this command] on their own. For this reason I set myself to writing a book > for the God-fearing, lest they be punished and think [it is] for no reason. > Far be it from God to do such a thing! (Gen. 18:25). . . . Therefore I have > set forth this Book of Fear so that those who fear the word of God can take > heed. ‚ÄúMore than these, my son, must you take heed‚Äù (Eccl. 12:12). Sefer Hasidim is replete with edicts that illuminate this theme of searching beyond the revealed instructions of the written and oral Torah and searching for the Ratzon Haborei. A specific example of this type of statute in Sefer Hasidim is the law of Chelev. Even though the oral law states clearly that one is permitted to derive benefit from Chelev, the Sefer Hasidim posits that if not for man's weaknesses it would have been forbidden, and thus it is forbidden to derive benefit from Chelev for any pious person. The elitism of this group of Hasidim was another theme present in Sefer Hasidim. The Hasid is assertive, elitist, and in certain senses extreme in his efforts to impose his system upon his surroundings. The Hasid did not view his religious observance as merely admirable; he viewed it as the standard duties of any Jew. Therefore, integral to the Hasid's divine worship was an aspiration to positively influence others. In part, Sefer Hasidim is sated with praise for those who serve the public and equally filled with admonition for those who cause others to stumble. Acting for the common good became a leitmotif in Sefer Hasidim, and failure to take a public stand against wrongdoing is perceived as a grave sin. It was the Hasid's goal to enlighten those who needed enlightenment. On the flip side, those who did not adhere to the \\"proper\\" lifestyle proscribed by Sefer Hasidim were constantly labeled as \\"Reshaim\\" (wicked ones). The \\"wicked\\" or the \\"unrighteous ones\\" were not to be called to the Torah, be given honors in the services, blow the ram's horn, or be a sandek at a circumcision. It is clear from Sefer Hasidim itself that this class of people was \\"wicked\\" simply from the perspective of the Hasidim. From the non-Hasid perspective, these often were scholars who make serious contributions to Halachic thought and give influential rulings on religious matters. \\"Wicked\\" to the Hasidic mind meant someone who did not live up to their austere standards. Other themes include penance and Lilmod al Mnat Lkayem (Learn in order to fulfill). ==Extent and influence== There has been much debate regarding the extent and influence that this movement had on the Middle Ages and beyond. Scholars debate whether or not this pious community described in Sefer Chassidim existed beyond the imagination of Rabbi Judah the Pious. For instance, Joseph Dan posits that Sefer Chassidim was an individual work by Rabbi Judah the Pious, not a \\"national work\\" of Ashkenazic Jewry. He concludes that the community depicted within Sefer Chassidim was merely a blueprint for a structure that was never built. Rabbi Judah's plans were never carried out. Many proofs motivated this approach. First, there is no reference in any Ashkenazic literature to any of its particular ideas. Additionally, there is no external proof of existence for Pietistic communities. A controversial movement such as this one, which castigated much of the broader community, labeling them reshaim (wicked), would certainly have been referenced by contemporary literature. However, others such as Isaiah Tishby maintain that Sefer Chassidim is an \\"enormous anthology, reflecting the work of generations of Ashkenazi Hasidic leaders\\". This led him to formulate this phenomenon as a movement which existed for generations and had a distinct group of leaders.Joseph Dan: Ashkenazi Hasidim, 1941‚Äì1991: Was There Really a Hasidic Movement in Medieval Germany?. In: Peter Sch√§fer, Joseph Dan: Gershom Scholem‚Äôs Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism 50 Years After. T√ºbingen: Mohr 1993, p. 95. Ivan G. Marcus raised support for the community's historicity by pointing out references to Chassidei Ashkenaz practices in Arba'ah Turim and Sefer ha-Manhig. He further admitted that all of the points questioning its existence do raise questions, but the questions raised by Dan and Gruenwald \\"do not prove that the pietist world as described in SH [Sefer Hasidim] did not exist\\", and \\"the existence of the hasidim per se and the influence of their customs are attested in non-pietist rabbinic sources\\".Ivan G.

Tishby also postulates that the fact that they considered all other Jews resha (iniquitous) and other anti-social tendencies (asceticism), is the reason they are not mentioned by anyone other than the Baal Tur and the Safer Haminhag, both of which only mention them but do not give them respect, rather than a reason they would be counted by their contemporaries, and the Jewish community, precisely opposing what Israeli scholar Joseph Dan holds. Prior to Dan no one questioned their existence over the centuries in which the book was studied. ==Outside sources== Though there may be earlier printed mentions that still exist, the book Yu·∏•asin by Abraham Zacuto, of which two original texts exist from the early 16th century (1500-1503) at Jewish museums, on leaf 221 mentions 'Eleazar Ben Yehudah Ben Kalonymous Of Worms', the son of Judah the Pious. It then takes a page to discuss his book Yera'i El (Fear of God) which is clearly a successor to the Pious of Ashkenaz book of this article. The book discusses many ideas including ideas of the three parts of God, etc. (not to be confused with Christianity; it makes clear, as all Judaism does, that God is not human and has no body). Secular philosopher Martin Buber twice stated that he was influenced by the books of the Hassidei Ashkenaz, once in a letter to Jewish Nietzschean story-teller Mica Josef Berdiczewsky, and a second time in his 1906 book Die Geschichten des Rabbi Nachman, which connects these ancient Jews to the 18th century Hassidism of Nachman of pre-Holocaust Breslev in Eastern Europe. ==References== ==Sources== * Joseph Dan, ‚ÄúAshkenazi Hasidim 1941-1991‚Äù in Major Trends of Jewish Mysticism 50 Years Later 1992 * T.

Homogeneous catalysis refers to reactions where the catalyst is in the same phase as the reactants, principally in solution. In contrast, heterogeneous catalysis describes processes where the catalysts and substrate are in distinct phases, typically solid-gas, respectively. The term is used almost exclusively to describe solutions and implies catalysis by organometallic compounds. Homogeneous catalysis is established technology that continues to evolve.P. W. N. M. van Leeuwen and J. C. Chadwick \\"Homogeneous Catalysts: Activity - Stability - Deactivation\\" Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2011. Online . An illustrative major application is the production of acetic acid.Enzymes are examples of homogeneous catalysts.. ==Examples== A constrained geometry complex. Such precatalysts are used for the production of polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene. ===Acid catalysis=== The proton is a pervasive homogeneous catalystR.P. Bell \\"The Proton in Chemistry\\", Chapman and Hall, London, 1973. because water is the most common solvent. Water forms protons by the process of self-ionization of water. In an illustrative case, acids accelerate (catalyze) the hydrolysis of esters: :CH3CO2CH3 \\\\+ H2O CH3CO2H + CH3OH At neutral pH, aqueous solutions of most esters do not hydrolyze at practical rates. ===Transition metal-catalysis=== Mechanism for the hydrogenation of an alkene catalyzed by the homogeneous catalyst Wilkinson's catalyst. ;Hydrogenation and related reactions A prominent class of reductive transformations are hydrogenations. In this process, H2 added to unsaturated substrates. A related methodology, transfer hydrogenation, involves by transfer of hydrogen from one substrate (the hydrogen donor) to another (the hydrogen acceptor). Related reactions entail \\"HX additions\\" where X = silyl (hydrosilylation) and CN (hydrocyanation). Most large-scale industrial hydrogenations - margerine, ammonia, benzene-to- cyclohexane - are conducted with heterogeneous catalysts. Fine chemical syntheses, however, often rely on homogeneous catalysts. ;Carbonylations Hydroformylation, a prominent form of carbonylation, involves the addition of H and \\"C(O)H\\" across a double bond. This process is almost exclusively conducted with soluble rhodium- and cobalt-containing complexes. A related carbonylation is the conversion of alcohols to carboxylic acids. MeOH and CO react in the presence of homogeneous catalysts to give acetic acid, as practiced in the Monsanto process and Cativa processes. Related reactions include hydrocarboxylation and hydroesterifications. ;Polymerization and metathesis of alkenes A number of polyolefins, e.g. polyethylene and polypropylene, are produced from ethylene and propylene by Ziegler-Natta catalysis. Heterogeneous catalysts dominate, but many soluble catalysts are employed especially for stereospecific polymers.Elschenbroich, C. ‚ÄùOrganometallics‚Äù (2006) Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. Olefin metathesis is usually catalyzed heterogeneously in industry, but homogeneous variants are valuable in fine chemical synthesis. ;Oxidations Homogeneous catalysts are also used in a variety of oxidations. Is the Wacker process, acetaldehyde is produced from ethylene and oxygen. Many non-organometallic complexes are also widely used in catalysis, e.g. for the production of terephthalic acid from xylene. Alkenes are epoxidized and dihydroxylated by metal complexes, as illustrated by the Halcon Process and the Sharpless dihydroxylation. ===Enzymes (including metalloenzymes)=== Enzymes are homogeneous catalysts that are essential for life but are also harnessed for industrial processes. A well-studied example is carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzes the release of CO2 into the lungs from the bloodstream. Enzymes possess properties of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. As such, they are usually regarded as a third, separate category of catalyst. Water is a common reagent in enzymatic catalysis. Esters and amides are slow to hydrolyze in neutral water, but the rates are sharply affected by metalloenzymes, which can be viewed as large coordination complexes. Acrylamide is prepared by the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of acrylonitrile. US demand for acrylamide was as of 2007. ==Advantages and Disadvantages== ===Advantages=== ‚Ä¢ Homogeneous catalysts are generally more selective than heterogeneous catalysts. ‚Ä¢ For exothermic processes, homogeneous catalysts dump heat into the solvent. ‚Ä¢ Homogeneous catalysts are easier to characterize precisely, so their reaction mechanisms are amenable to rational manipulation.G. O. Spessard and G. L. Miessler \\"Organometallic Chemistry\\", Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 1997, pp. 249-251. ===Disadvantages=== ‚Ä¢ The separation of homogeneous catalysts from products can be challenging. In some cases involving high activity catalysts, the catalyst is not removed from the product. In other cases, organic products are sufficiently volatile than they can be separated by distillation. ‚Ä¢ Homogeneous catalyst have limited thermal stability compared to heterogeneous catalysts. Many organometallic complexes degrade <100 ¬∞C. Some pincer-based catalysts, however, operate near 200 ¬∞C. ==See also== * Concurrent tandem catalysis ==References== Category:Catalysis ","title":"Homogeneous catalysis"},{"id":"1427721","text":"Zion's Camp was an expedition of Latter Day Saints led by Joseph Smith, from Kirtland, Ohio, to Clay County, Missouri, during May and June 1834 in an unsuccessful attempt to regain land from which the Saints had been expelled by non-Mormon settlers. In Latter Day Saint belief, this land is destined to become a city of Zion, the center of the millennial kingdom; and Smith dictated a command from God ordering him to lead his church like a modern Moses to redeem Zion \\"by power, and with a stretched-out arm.\\"D&C; 103:15-18. Receiving word of the approaching Latter Day Saints, the Missourians formed militias, which outnumbered Smith's men. Smith then dictated another revelation stating that the church was presently unworthy to \\"redeem Zion\\" because of its lack of commitment to the United Order, or law of consecration.LDS D&C; 105:2-5. They were told they must \\"wait a little season\\" until its elders could receive their promised endowment of heavenly power.D&C; 105:9-13. The expedition was disbanded on July 25, 1834, during a cholera epidemic, and a majority of survivors returned to Ohio. Nevertheless, the failed expedition permitted Smith to determine the most faithful Latter Day Saints among the group, and most Latter Day Saint leaders of the following years were selected from among these men. ==Background== A fundamental tenet of Latter Day Saint theology is that the biblical New Jerusalem will be built in the Americas,LDS Articles of Faith 10. a belief established by 1829 and included in the Book of Mormon.Book of Ether chapter 13. On July 20, 1831, Smith identified the location of this New Jerusalem as Jackson County, MissouriLDS D&C; 57:1-3. and began sending Latter Day Saint settlers there to establish a City of Zion, which was to be a Latter Day Saint millennial kingdom. By the summer of 1833, there were about 1,200 Latter Day Saints in Jackson County,. and older settlers felt threatened by their political and economic power, a fear exacerbated by rumors that Latter Day Saints favored abolitionism.. Forming militia groups, the \\"old settlers\\" as they were called, organized attacks against the Latter Day Saints during the summer of 1833. A revelation dictated by Smith in August 1833 discouraged immediate retaliationBushman at 235; LDS D&C; 98 but permitted Latter Day Saints to retaliate after the fourth act of aggression and \\"unto the third and fourth generation.\\"; LDS D&C; 98 The Saints initially attempted to regain their lands through political and legal means, enlisting four Missouri attorneys to communicate with the court and the Missouri government.. This decision to engage lawyers and fight the issue in court likely sparked further violence in late October 1833.. When the Missourians attacked the Saints the fourth time, they fought back as allowed by Smith's revelation.. By the end of 1833, Latter Day Saint homes, as well as the church's print shop, had been destroyed, and nearly all church members had fled the county. Latter Day Saint refugees settled temporarily in neighboring counties, including Clay County to the north, across the Missouri River from Jackson County. In December 1833, Smith dictated another revelation about the \\"redemption of Zion.\\"LDS D&C; 101:43. It commanded Missouri settlers to seek redress through the courts or the political processLDS D&C; 101:76-88; . but warned that a military solution would become necessary should those efforts fail. (letter by Joseph Smith stating that if the government fails to restore the Missouri Saints to their land, then God \\"will come with ten thousand of His Saints, and all his adversaries shall be destroyed with the breath of His lips\\"). The revelation predicted that God would soon command SmithThe revelation refers to \\"the servant,\\" whose identity as Smith was revealed in a later revelation dated February 24, 1834. See D&C; 103:21. to gather warriors of the church to \\"get ye straightway unto my land; break down the walls of mine enemies; throw down their tower, and scatter their watchmen.\\"LDS D&C; 101:55-57. Further, should the Missourians oppose the Saints, the latter would \\"avenge me of mine enemies, that by and by I may come with the residue of mine house and possess the land.\\"LDS D&C; 101:58. The legal and political efforts appeared futile, although after the security of a February 24, 1834 court hearing was threatened by Missourian protesters, it was postponed until late 1834.. ==Formation of the camp== At the headquarters of the Latter Day Saints in Kirtland, Ohio, Smith received a revelation from God, calling for an expedition to be raised in Kirtland, which would then march to Missouri and \\"redeem Zion.\\"Bushman, 236; D&C; 101:75: \\"There is even now already in store sufficient, yea, even an abundance, to redeem Zion, and establish her waste places, no more to be thrown down, were the churches, who call themselves after my name, willing to hearken to my voice.\\" About 200 men and a number of women and children volunteered to join this expedition which became known as \\"Zion's Camp.\\" ==The march== Smith and his volunteers left Kirtland on May 4, 1834. By June 4, they had marched across Indiana and Illinois, reaching the Mississippi River, which they crossed, entering Missouri. They crossed most of the state by the end of June, and news of their approach caused some alarm among non-Mormons in Jackson and Clay Counties. Attempts to negotiate a return of the Latter Day Saints to Jackson County proved fruitless, but Smith decided to disband Zion's Camp rather than attempt to \\"redeem Zion\\" by force. Many members of the camp believed they should fight and criticized Smith. Subsequently many contracted cholera. The 900 mile march failed in its objective, and fourteen participants died. ==Aftermath== Smith encountered increased hostility when he returned to Kirtland. Nevertheless, many of the participants in Zion's Camp became committed loyalists to the movement.\\"Zion's Camp was Joseph Smith's second major failure....Far from being a second Moses, he had left the exiled colony still outside the promised land and had returned with little except consoling words for the families of the fourteen dead. Kirtland met him with a hostility that exceeded his worst fears, for Sylvester Smith had rushed back with a dismal story of defeat without honor.\\" Brodie, 159-160. Bushman says, \\"Nothing that Joseph aimed to accomplish came about. Several hundred men spent three months walking two thousand miles; fourteen of them never came home. Nothing the camp did improved the situation in Jackson County.... Was Zion's Camp a catastrophe? Perhaps, but it was not the unmitigated disaster that it appears to be. Most camp members felt more loyal to Joseph than ever, bonded by their hardships. The future leadership of the Church came from this group.\\" (247) When Smith returned to Kirtland, he organized the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the First Quorum of the Seventy, choosing primarily men who had served in Zion's Camp.Bushman, 247. The Latter Day Saints failed to achieve their goal of returning to Jackson County, and although the Missouri legislature approved a compromise which set aside the new Caldwell County specifically for their settlement in 1836, two years later, Missourians drove the Saints across the Mississippi into Illinois.Bushman, 247. Long after Smith's death, members of what is now known as the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) became the first members of the Latter Day Saint movement to return to Jackson County in an attempt to redeem Zion. ==See also== *List of Zion's Camp participants ==Notes== ==References== * (see Wikipedia article). * * *. *. *. * *. *.

It is an important market town. The commune covers an area of 3,966 square kilometres and as of 2002 had a population of 181,895 people. ==General information== The city of Djougou is the capital city of the department of the Donga, and is considered to be the commercial capital of the Atacora-Donga region, with Natitingou acting as the seat of government and the primary tourist city. Djougou has a population of over 237,000 according to 2009 recensement . While Dendi is the primary language and ethnic group in Djougou,Zima, Petr. 1994. Lexique dendi (songhay): Djougou, B√©nin: avec un index fran√ßais-dendi. (Westafrikanische Studien 4). K√∂ln: R√ºdiger K√∂ppe. there are also a number of Fulani, Pull, Yoruba, Bariba, as well as transplanted Fon from the South. Like most of Benin, Djougou has a young and growing population. Large families and multiple wives are common‚Äîleading to a large number of young and school-aged children and pregnant women. There are many different neighborhoods throughout the city, but they are fairly amorphous. People are quicker to identify where they live not by the name of their neighborhood, but by which main road it lies on or by a nearby landmark or mosque. The population of Djougou is predominantly Muslim, with each neighborhood boasting at least one mosque. Muslims in Djougou range from the very conservative to the fairly liberal. It is relatively common to see women completely veiled in black, including their faces. More often, however, Muslim women wear a headscarf and a few wear no veil of any kind. This wardrobe decision is made by following family tradition until marriage, after which she follows the traditions of her husband‚Äôs family. Conservative Muslim men refrain from alcohol, but most are not opposed to drinking. Nearly all Muslims abstain from eating pork and observe the calls to prayer. There is a considerable Catholic presence in Djougou as well with a large cathedral, a convent, seminary, and Catholic school system that runs through secondary school. Religion is important to the people of Djougou and it is common to be asked your religious affiliation when meeting someone new. This is done out of curiosity, not prejudice, and there appears to be a considerable amount of religious tolerance here. Christian and Muslim holidays are both celebrated. ==Transportation and communication== Djougou is a major hub of transportation and communication. It acts as a crossroads of trade and travel, and is easily accessible during the entire year. There are four major roads that intersect to form the city‚Äôs center‚Äîthe roads to Cotonou, Parakou, Natitingou, and the Ouake/Togolese border. As a relatively wealthy city, there are members of the community who own private cars. Many families in the community have at least one moto that they use as their primary means of transportation. In addition, Z√©midjan are easy to find throughout the city. Cell phone communication is very consistent in Djougou, and all major carriers have service in the area pretty much all of the time. Internet communication is also available in the cyber cafes and in some office buildings, although the connection is not always reliable. ==Safety and security== The primary safety concern cited by community members is petty theft and community members take precautions by keeping valuables under lock and key. Instances of theft are rarely solved by the police, but are instead resolved by community pressure or occasionally physical, public retribution. There are two major gendarmerie (police) offices in Djougou in addition to a military camp near Taifa. These security forces make the city safe not to add the plenty public lights and the influx of solar-based system for public lighting. ==Water and sanitation== People in Djougou obtain their water from several sources. Many homes and places of work have running tap water. Other concessions have a communal well from which people draw their water. There is a lake bordering Djougou on the southern side, but community members do not fetch water directly from it and access has been recently restricted after the drowning of child playing near the dam in 2009. While people here do not boil their drinking water, they agree that tap water is healthier than well water. The water supply is consistent, and few experience problems with access of some kind. Concessions all have private latrines and some homes with running water also have toilets. Latrines are covered and almost always set an adequate distance from the school, restaurant, etc. for sanitation reasons. Most animals are well-maintained. Even if they are not confined, they are usually guarded by someone and kept within a certain area or distance. There is both natural and plastic trash in Djougou‚Äîboth of which people usually dump by the side of the road or into large areas of tall grass. This trash is then burned with the grass during the Harmatton season. The city as a whole is fairly clean. The air quality is better than expected for the size of the city, and most public areas such as schools and restaurants are kept clean, especially in comparison to larger southern cities like Porto Novo. A trial program began in November 2010 for trash collection. ==Food and supplies== The grand march√© in Djougou is held every 4 days, but the market area is open every day. Djougou hosts the largest market in the area. On a daily basis in the market one can find grains, salt, bread, sugar, fish, wagasi, eggs, tomatoes, onions, peppers, meat, lettuce, soy cheese, dried pasta, tomato paste, garlic, oil, cabbage, oranges, citrons, bananas, plantains, and, seasonally, pineapples and avocados. Wagasi which local made cheese out of fresh cow milk is the region delicacy and one should always try to eat it before leaving. In addition to the open market, there are also several boutiques where one can find more expensive items like jelly, butter, spices, cookies, coffee, powdered milk, Lipton tea, wine, and liquor. These boutiques also sell toiletry items such as toilet paper, facial tissues, soap, razors, and toothpaste. There is a supermarch√© that recently opened where all of these items can be found in addition to tissue, cooking utensils, PEB mattress items, purses, fake flowers, perfume, and brassieres! People generally eat three meals a day‚Äîtwo of rice and beans (watchi) with wagasi or pate/akassa, and one of yam pil√©e. The first meal is eaten around 8 or 8:30 in the morning, the second around noon or 1 pm, and the third as the sun sets around 8 or later, 9pm. When certain fruits, such as pineapples or avocados, are only available during certain seasons, there is no discernible 'hungry season' in Djougou where food is not as available. People report that, 'for the very poor, it is always the hungry season, for those with enough money, one can always find food.' ==Income, business, and money== All manner of work is done in Djougou. People spend their money on food, supplies, household items, and gasoline for their cars and motos. People say they try to save money for travel, families with children save money for school fees, and everyone complains that the most expensive thing they constantly need to buy is phone credit. There are many groupements and associations centered around different trades in Djougou, including tissage and shea butter. There are several tailors, carpenters, boutique owners, etc. throughout Djougou, but community members usually just go to the one in closest proximity to their homes. There is no concept of business competition and 'shopping around' to get the best price, even though people will bargain extensively with their local tailor or carpenter. It is seen as disrespectful to one's neighborhood to solicit the services of someone further away, even if the quality or price may be better. There are many artisans in Djougou. One local artisan makes jewelry boxes and other small items out of animal skins. There is a groupement of artisans that make high class tissage/ They have a new production center, donated by a Swiss NGO, and are in the process of figuring out how to market their high end product to a community that cannot always afford it. They are currently attempting to get space at the artisans market in Cotonou. Most artisans say that they would like to find some way to market their products their products in America. Because Djougou is a major crossroads for the Atacora-Donga region, many people also work in transportation and travel, as truck drivers, chauffeurs, mechanics, or for one of the major bus lines. There are also two hotels. In cooperation with the mayor's office, those who work in transportation and hospitality are also interested in developing the tourist industry in Djougou‚Äîmodeling it after the more successful tourist businesses in Natitingou and Tanguieta. ==Schools== There are three CEGs in Djougou, two that have classes for all grade levels‚Äî6ieme through terminale, and one that has classes just through the first cycle‚Äî6ieme through 3ieme. There is also a Catholic primary and secondary school. In the CEGs, teachers report class sizes of 40 and 50. Students must pay for their uniforms and books in order to attend. In the first cycle classes, there is generally a balance of male and female students, but in the upper classes, 3ieme through terminale, there begins to be more male students than female. Several reasons are cited for children stopping school; including being needed to work at home, the need to send another child to school instead, and for girls, teenage pregnancy. For extracurricular activities, the CEGs have girls' clubs and Amour et Vie clubs to promote health, but they are voluntary and not directly related to school activities. Boys also stay after school to play football. ==Recreation== Young children mainly play in their concessions and in their neighborhoods. There is a major sports stadium in Djougou where football games, cultural events, and concerts are held. There are also several football fields throughout the city where boys gather on the weekends to play pick-up games. Children also play football at the CEGs. There is a Maison de Jeunesin the center of town, with a big screen TV that shows football games throughout the day. Small children who do not have the 150 francs stand outside and watch and cheer through the windows. This venue also hosts other events and presentations and there is a well ventilated and attended cyber caf√©with relatively reliable internet connection for 400 francs. Most recreational activities are geared toward men and boys, with women expected to be helping out with household chores during their free time. Women spend a lot of their free time multi-tasking, making yam pile or selling a good at the march√© while gossiping simultaneously or listening to music on their cell phones. ==Health facilities== Djougou has two major public health centers and one private hospital. Each of these facilities is run by at least one physician; the private hospital has at least two on duty at any given time. There are also several private facilities run by and midwives which perform births and do maternal and child healthcare specifically. There is also a fixed HIV testing and counseling center on the campus of the regional health center that does testing and HIV counseling on Wednesdays. As the majority of health personnel are government employees, many health workers are in Djougou by contractual obligation for a number of years; and few see it as an ideal post. Many would prefer to work down south, specifically in Cotonou, and many have left family behind in the south and plan to return as soon as possible. This may contribute to issues of motivation and work ethic. Both the public health centers and private hospital keep regular hours, and supplies are generally available when needed. Health workers cited that a major problem is getting people to come to the health center‚Äîonce they are there adequate care can usually be provided. Transportation to the health centers is particularly challenging, particularly for members of smaller villages and communities surrounding the city whose health centers do not offer comprehensive care. Mosquito nets are available at the health centers for children under 5 and pregnant women, and can also be purchased at a subsidized price from the pharmacy and other local vendors. Condoms are also widely available. Health facilities are kept fairly clean‚Äîeach has running water and latrines that are far removed from areas of patient care. Hazardous waste material is separated from regular trash and disposed of separately. Most patients at the health center are pregnant women and children under 5. Pregnant women come to the health center for prenatal consultations, births, or if they suspect they have malaria. Children under 5 are brought for pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria. Health workers agree that malnutrition is a problem among many children in Djougou, but that mothers rarely identify this as the reason for bringing their children to the health center. The health centers are much busier during malaria season‚Äîpatient loads can more than double during this time, and one can see men and young adults at the clinic as well. The health centers each have an ambulance to provide emergency transportation. This is usually done in the case of labor complications in women who choose to give birth at home or in a smaller birthing facility. However, use of the ambulance is rare‚Äîin most cases family members will transport even patients in crisis situations themselves. There is a quiet presence of traditional healers in Djougou. These gueriseurs give out powders and prayers in their homes for headaches and other simple maladies and they do not have any formal training. Many of these healers do not speak French and charge a small fee. The people of Djougou are relatively well educated and are slightly embarrassed by visiting such healers, but for cultural reasons, traditional healers are persistent and cause little harm. For small issues, it is often easier, cheaper, and more familiar than going to the health care center centre de sant√© and does not appear to cause any problems or restrict utilization of western medicine when time and money allow. ==International relations== ===Twin towns and sister cities=== Djougou is twinned with: * Al Wakrah (2014) ==References== Category:Arrondissements of Benin Category:Populated places in Benin Category:Communes of Benin ","title":"Djougou"},{"id":"1427725","text":"Malanville is a city, arrondissement and commune in the Alibori Department of northeastern Benin, located across the River Niger from Niger. It is known as a centre of cross-border trade and has a major market. Malanville is also a centre for rice-growing. The commune covers an area of 3016 square kilometres and as of 2013 had a population of 168,006 people. ==History== Malanville has an extremely diverse population consisting of a large Muslim community, large Christian community, French speakers and speakers of local languages, as well as several practitioners of local religions. The cuisine is a mixture of African and European. Despite the differences that exist between these groups, they live side-by-side in peace and share public and private sector responsibilities. ==Geography== Malanville is located in B√©nin's northern region, along the B√©nin/Niger border, located 733 kilometres from Cotonou. It is connected to the city of Gaya, Niger via a bridge over the Niger River. It resides approximately 35 km down the Niger River from Karimama which it is indirectly connected to via road. The terrain and climate are desert-like, arid, and sunny, and have little water. Communally, Malanville is bounded to the north by Niger, the south by Kandi and S√©gbana, to the west by Karimama and to the east by Nigeria. ==Administrative divisions== Malanville is subdivided into five arrondissements; Malanville, Garou, Gu√©n√®, Mand√©cali and Tomboutou . They contain 20 villages and 12 urban districts. ==Economy== The population of Malanville engages primarily in agricultural activities, followed by trade, transportation and handicrafts.

The commune covers an area of 3045 square kilometres and as of 2013 had a population of 104,010 people. ==History== The town was founded by the Waama ethnic groups but is populated with Ditammari, Dendi, Nateni, Fulani, Fon, and many other ethnic groups. The town takes its name from the word Nantibatingou, from the Waama root \\"Nanto\\" meaning to crush, as the local people were renowned growers of sorghum which was native to the area and later millet. Natitingou is evenly divided between Christians and Muslims and, like the rest of Benin, is notable for its ethnic and religious tolerance. The mountains surrounding the region to the east and west sides are important in local animists, who believe them to be inhabited by spirits. Certain people subscribe to the idea that during the evening these spirits emit sounds similar to those produced by stones which women uses to crush cereal grains. Adherents do not crush cereals in the evening, so as not to confuse the two sounds. European missionaries visited Natitingou in the 19th century and early 20th century. ==Geography== The main road running through Natitingou The town of Natitingou belongs to the Department of Atakora in northwestern Benin. It lies in a semi-valley, formed by the two mountain ridges that surround it. Natitingou is located 645 km from the economic capital of Cotonou and 100 km from Porga at the entrance of the Pendjari National Park. The commune is bounded on the north by Toucountouna, south and east by Kouand√© and to the west by the commune of Boukomb√©. The climate in Natitingou is drier than in the south, particularly during the Harmattan season in December/January, when humidity can be as low as 10% and night temperatures can be as low as 17 degrees Celsius. ===Climate=== ==Administrative divisions== Natitingou is subdivided into nine arrondissements; four of them urban: Natitingou I, Natitingou II, Natitingou III and Natitingou IV (P√©poriyakou) and five of them rural:Kotapounga, Kouaba, Koundata, Perma and Tchoumi-Tchoumi. They contain 39 villages and 26 urban districts. ==Demographics== The commune has a population of 75,620 inhabitants according to the 2002 census (57,153 in 1992) with 37,388 men and 38,223 women. The density is 56 inhabitants per km¬≤. The population is predominantly young. A multitude of ethnic groups reside here speaking a variety of languages. The main ethnic groups are the Ditammari, Waama and Dendi. Other than traditional animism, Christianity and Islam are the main religions practised, and there are a number of churches and mosques in the area. However, many local Christians and Muslims often simultaneously believe in animist practices and join in traditional events in Natitingou. ==Economy== People in the urban districts of Natitingou are mostly civil servants, craftsmen and merchants. Natitingou has an important administrative function and has some of the most important administrative bodies and services in the Atakora Department. Agriculture is the backbone to the rural economy, and farmers produce sorghum, maize, yams and, more recently, cotton as a commercial product. The manufacture and marketing of the local drink known as Tchoucoutou is also very important, and is produced by housewives and is their main source of income. The drink is sold to nightclubs where there are many consumers. Tchoucoutou is made from the grain sorghum and is a form of malt beer. ==Tourism== A marketplace in Natitingou Natitingou is about 50 km from Benin's Pendjari National Park, where tourists can see West African wildlife during the months of December through June.Butler, Stuart (2019) Bradt Travel Guide - Benin, pgs. 161-64 The Kota and Tanougou waterfalls, the great mud castles of the Betammaribe known as the Tata Somba are also within an hour or two of the town by car. Within the town itself can be found the Regional Museum of Natitingou, as well as two marketplaces. ==Notable people== Villanova University Men's Basketball player Mouphtaou Yarou is a native of Natitingou. He was ranked #9 in 2009 among high school basketball prospects in America. Charles Thiebaut, a promoter of African music and culture in France, is a native of Natitingou.

Population: ==History== Olonets is the oldest documented settlement in Karelia, mentioned by Novgorodian sources as early as 1137. Its history is obscure until 1649, when a fortress was built there to protect the Grand Duchy of Moscow against the Swedes. The same year it was granted town privileges. Until the Great Northern War, Olonets developed as a principal market for Russian trade with Sweden. To the south from the town, there sprawled a belt of fortified abbeys, of which the Alexander-Svirsky Monastery was the most important. In the 18th century, Olonets' importance shifted from trade to ironworking industries. In 1773, it was made the seat of Olonets Governorate. Eleven years later, however, the seat was moved to Petrozavodsk and Olonets started to decline. Modern Olonets is classified as a historical town of the Republic of Karelia and is the only town in the republic where Karelians are in majority (over 60% ). ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, Olonets serves as the administrative center of Olonetsky District, under which it is directly subordinated.Law #871-RZK As a municipal division, the town of Olonets, together with eight rural localities, is incorporated within Olonetsky Municipal District as Olonetskoye Urban Settlement.Law #813-RZK ==Notable people== * Walery Mroczkowski (1840-1889) was born in Olonets.

Best known for his photographs of endangered species of birds, he was chief photographer of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Luther was born in Washington, D.C., on November 2, 1909. He was fortunate in his younger years to learn nature lore from his father, Edward A. Goldman, an eminent naturalist. In teenage summer months he served as camp boy on research expeditions in Arizona, trapping and preparing specimens of mammals, his early interest, and also gaining field experience with the Predator and Rodent Control Branch of the Bureau of Biological Survey of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. At the University of Maryland he earned a degree in biological sciences and lettered as a football first-string lineman. Three years of field work followed: in Mexico (two winters) for biological investigations of wintering waterfowl, as a member of a party in Baja California to collect mountain sheep (a new subspecies), in Florida, as assistant in Arthur H. Howell‚Äôs fauna research, and in Arizona for mammal research on the north rim of the Grand Canyon. In 1939, he married his college sweetheart, Mary Elizabeth (Betty) Mulligan. That year, too, was the beginning of his 20-year career as manager of national wildlife refuges at the new Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge in California. Luther's intense interest in ornithology and in wildlife photography developed early as a result of living in remote areas with poor access to good film developing and printing sources. He took up his own darkroom work and began documenting required narrative reports to the Washington D.C office with 8\\" x 10\\" prints. His illustrations attracted immediate attention, and copies of his photographs began to appear on the covers of Bureau reports and elsewhere. In 1941, he attended the first in Training School on Bureau procedures and activities at Patuxent Research Refuge in Laurel, Maryland. He spent months on a one-man biological reconnaissance prior to establishment of the Imperial and Havasu National Wildlife Refuges on the lower Colorado River in Arizona. Development plans for the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge were put on hold due to unstable conditions of the Sea's water table. In 1942, Luther transferred to New Mexico to manage the Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge. Along with normal refuge activities was an engineering project to change the course of the Pecos River for control of bank erosion. At night, only the bright lights of the far off German prisoner-of-war camp could be seen. Entering active duty in the U.S. Army in 1943, Luther served for three years as entomologist. Upon his return to civilian life he was offered three choices in wildlife refuge management. He seized the opportunity to research and develop the two new national wildlife refuges on the Texas-Mexico border in the Rio Grande Valley‚Äîthe Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge and the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge. The next 12 years (1947‚Äì59) were filled with excitement and challenges. In Wild America, co-authored with Roger Tory Peterson after their birding expedition around North America, James Fisher wrote of him, \\"Luther is one of the best field men I have ever encountered.‚Äù After the aforementioned 20 years on western refuges (including Army service), Luther accepted a position in the Washington Office as assistant chief, Section of Wildlife Management in the Branch of Wildlife Refuges. He, Betty, and their son, Edward, moved to College Park, Maryland. He served on many panels and teams, including Secretary Udall's Eagle Survey Team, which resulted in new restrictions on poisoning, trapping, and aerial hunting of eagles in the U.S. Later, his abilities in wildlife photography led to his appointment as the Bureau's chief photographer and curator of the extensive photo files, for which he photographed endangered species and field activities. He received a certificate of commendation for his photography in the publication of Interior's Birds in Our Lives. Through these years, his many other biological and photographic duties included consultation on scientific matters and representing the Division of Wildlife Refuges at the Mountain Sheep Conference in Hermocillo, Mexico. In cooperation with the National Aeronautical Space Administration and the Atomic Energy Commission, Luther photographed wildlife on Amchitka Island, Alaska, to determine the effect of subterranean atomic bomb blasts on surface fauna and wildlife on the Kenai Peninsula. With Dr. Donald Aldrich and artist Bob Hines, he selected and arranged the annual showing of Duck Stamp art entries for judges‚Äô selection of the contest winner. On the U.S.-Canadian team to secure whooping crane eggs from the Northwest Territories, Canada, Luther photographed the operation from the air and on the ground and wrote an account for the Bureau publication In-Sight (40,000 copies reprinted for wide distribution). He made a second trip for team egg-pickup in 1974. With Dr. Aldrich, he made a six-year study and photographic record of the bald eagle from nestling to adult to determine its age when acquiring complete white head and tail feathers. Prior to the California condors‚Äô disappearance in the wild, in cooperation with the National Wildlife Federation, Luther photographed them in the mountains of Sespe National Sanctuary, northeast of Los Angeles. He created slide shows concerning endangered species for use by the Regional and Washington Offices, as well as on loan to the general public. His photographs have hung in the U.S. Capitol, State Department, museums in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the library of Peter Scott at Slimbridge, and are widely used in publications of the federal government and National Geographic Society and in books by conservation authors. Retiring in 1974 after 35 years of government service, he led many natural history tours, both in the National Capitol area as well as abroad, including such places as Trinidad & Tobago. He was honored by both the Montgomery County Chapter of the Maryland Ornithological Society and the Prince George's County Audubon Society, highlighting the contributions he made to them and to the cause of wildlife preservation in general. He was elected to membership in the Washington Biologists‚Äô Field Club in 1960 and was chairman of Books and Photographs Committee. When The Members and History of the Washington Biologists‚Äô Field Club was revised in 1984 and the Supplement in 1993, Luther supplied the photographs, printing many from old negatives (some glass plates) and developing and printing new ones. In 1996, he was selected to become an honorary member. Luther lived with his wife, Betty. for many years in their home in College Park, Maryland, until her death in 2002. He continued to live alone and be very active with birding projects. Luther died at age 95 in Lanham, Maryland, on January 12, 2005, after a short illness. Luther was one of the most popular and active members of the Washington Biologists‚Äô Field Club and attended an oyster roast on Plummers Island on October 30, 2004, just three days before his 95th birthday. ==External links== *http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/resshow/perry/bios/GoldmanLuther.htm Category:1909 births Category:2005 deaths Category:American naturalists Category:20th- century American photographers Category:University of Maryland, College Park alumni Category:People from Washington, D.C.

It is situated in the New Forest on the western shore of the Solent, approximately 7 miles (11 kilometres) south of Southampton. Fawley is also the site of Fawley Refinery, operated by ExxonMobil, which is the largest facility of its kind in the United Kingdom. The decommissioned Fawley Power Station is also located less than a mile to the south east of the village. ==The village of Fawley== A settlement has existed at Fawley for many centuries, and the village itself was recorded in the Domesday Book. Other areas in the parish can boast remains from the Stone Age and Roman occupation. A church at Fawley apparently existed in 971. The present church (All Saints) was built between 1170 and 1340. This church still exists and is the parish church of much of the surrounding area. The arrival of the Esso oil refinery in 1921 transformed a sparsely populated agricultural area into an industrial centre with a population of around 14,500. Modern Fawley is smaller and less populous than its more recently founded neighbours, Holbury and Blackfield, but remains the administrative centre of the parish. Other villages within the parish of Fawley include Hardley (a suburb of Holbury), Langley (a suburb of Blackfield), Ashlett, and Calshot. Calshot possesses shingle beaches and attracts significant numbers of tourists and local visitors during the summer months. Near Calshot is Luttrell's Tower, an 18th-century Gothic folly.Hampshire Treasures, Volume 5 (New Forest), Page 125 ==History== The origin of the name \\"Fawley\\" is uncertain. It might mean \\"fallow(-coloured) wood/clearing\\" or \\"clearing with land broken in for arable\\".Fawley, Old Hampshire Gazetteer In Domesday Book of 1086 Fawley is listed among those lands which were held by the Bishop of Winchester for the support of the monks of Winchester.Domesday Map - Fawley In 1284 the monks gave up all their rights in Fawley to the bishop.Victoria County History, (1912), A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 5, Fawley There seems to have been a close connexion between Fawley Manor and the manor of Bitterne, which also belonged to the bishops of Winchester. In 1546 John Skullard was tenant at Fawley Manor, which remained in the hands of that family until 1681. In 1705 the manor was conveyed to Edward Peachey, and a family settlement concerning Fawley Manor was made by William and Erlysman Peachy in 1765. In 1801 the manor was conveyed to Robert Drummond of Cadlands. Fawley thus became annexed to the neighbouring manor of Cadlands. The manor of Cadlands was in the 13th century attached to the lordship of the Isle of Wight until the end of the century when the overlordship was sold to the Crown. The manor was held from 1241 onwards by Titchfield Abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Sometime after 1560 the manor was combined with the estates of Holbury and Langley, and it subsequently fell into two moieties. One moiety was in the possession of the Stanley family from 1693 onwards, the other moiety passed to Lady Mary Talbot, and thence after 1772 into Drummond family. The Cadland estate, which stretched down the coast of Southampton Water for nearly eight miles, was the residence of the Drummond family, who owned most of the land in the parish. Cadland house was built in 1773, but was greatly enlarged in 1836; it burnt down in 1916 but was rebuilt in 1935.Fawley - southernlife.org.uk It was subsequently demolished with the growth of Fawley oil refinery which is built over much of the old Cadlands estate. Three other estates in the parish are those of Ower, Stanswood, and Stone, all of which are recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, and still exist as farms in the south of the parish. With a size of 37 households, Stanswood was in fact the largest settlement in the area in 1086.Domesday Map - Stanswood ===Notable people=== *Edward Unwin (1864‚Äì1950), recipient of the Victoria Cross * Revd William Gibson (1804‚Äì1862), parish priest, father of: ::Arthur Sumner Gibson (1844‚Äì1927), England rugby union international, born in Fawley ::Edgar Charles Sumner Gibson (1848‚Äì1924), Bishop of Gloucester, born in Fawley ::John Sumner Gibson (1833‚Äì1892), English clergyman and cricketer ==Sport and leisure== Fawley has a Non-League football club Fawley A.F.C., which plays at the Waterside Sports & Social Club. The formerly known Waterside Sports and Social Club (casually known as the Esso club) suffered financial difficulties, however ExxonMobil and Holbury Community Sports Association (HCSA) plan to refurbish the site and keep the changing rooms, tennis courts, and other facilities still running. Fawley also has a Rugby union team, Fawley RFC, who play out of Newlands Park close to Fawley as of 2016 having left their former home ground at the Esso club. ==Fawley oil refinery and chemical works== A refinery at Fawley was first established in 1921 by the Atlantic Gulf and West Indies Company. It was acquired by Esso in 1925, and it was rebuilt and extended in 1951. It is the largest oil refinery in the United Kingdom with a capacity of 330,000 barrels a day.Fawley refinery, ExxonMobil ==References== ==External links== * Fawley Parish Council * Community website for Fawley * Fawley Churches * Welcome to Fawley - an introduction to Fawley's oil refinery from Exxon Mobil Fawley Category:Ports and harbours of Hampshire Category:Populated coastal places in Hampshire ","title":"Fawley, Hampshire"},{"id":"1427779","text":"The President, Dr. A.P.J.

The aim was to provide aid during the Polish- Soviet War (1919‚Äì1921), and to create a strong Polish military to serve as a useful ally against Germany. It was an advisory body consisting of about 400 French officers attached to staffs of Polish units at various levels. Although the French mission was small numerically, its effect was substantial in improving the organisation and logistics of the Polish army. It worked in parallel with the smaller British Military Mission to Poland. It existed from 1918 to 1939. Its first commander was French General Paul Prosper Henrys, previously the commander of French forces in the Balkans. The French mission, composed of 400 officer-instructors, met with much respect. The instructors, many of them centered on the Polish General Staff, were crucial in training the emerging Polish officer corps. The French effort was vital in improving the organisation of the newly formed Polish army, which up till 1919 used various manuals, organisation structures and equipment, mostly from the former partitioners armies. Among the French officers was the future President of France, Charles de Gaulle. This mission should not be confused with the Interallied Mission to Poland, an improvised effort launched by David Lloyd George on July 21, 1920, at the height of the crisis before the Battle of Warsaw. The purpose of that mission was to send a number of high level personages from Britain and France to Poland in an attempt to influence Polish policy, possibly through effecting a change in government. They included French diplomat, Jean Jules Jusserand, Maxime Weygand, chief of staff to Marshal Ferdinand Foch (the Supreme Commander of the victorious Entente), and the British diplomat, Lord Edgar Vincent D'Abernon. The crucial Battle of Warsaw was won in the early days of August, before the mission could achieve anything of importance. The only tangible result was the installation of Weygand as an advisor to the Polish General Staff, where his role was negligible. Nevertheless, soon after the battle and for various political reasons, a myth arose that Weygand was the author of the Polish victory at Warsaw. ==See also== * Blue Army * Western betrayal Category:Polish‚ÄìSoviet War Category:Military history of France Category:Second Polish Republic Category:France‚ÄìPoland military relations Category:France‚ÄìSoviet Union relations ","title":"French Military Mission to Poland"},{"id":"1427800","text":"Phyllida Ann Law (born 8 May 1932) is a Scottish actress, known for her numerous roles in film and television. ==Early life== Law was born in Glasgow, the daughter of Megsie \\"Meg\\" and William Law, a journalist.

Capybaras are the largest living rodents in the world. The genus name is derived from the Greek ·ΩïŒ¥œâœÅ (h√Ωdor, water) plus œáŒøŒØœÅŒøœÇ (cho√≠ros, pig). == Characteristics == Capybaras are semiaquatic, found in and near lakes, rivers, swamps, and flooded savanna. Their diets are dominated by grasses. Adults weigh up to . The gestation period is 130‚Äì150 days, with two to eight (most commonly four) young born to females. == Behavior == Capybaras are highly social, living in groups of up to 100 and communicating through a variety of vocalizations.Rowe and Honeycutt, 2002 Breeding is polygynous, with males forming harems. == Phylogeny and taxonomy == Molecular results have consistently suggested Hydrochoerus is most closely related to Kerodon (the rock cavies), and the two evolved from within the Caviidae. This led Woods and Kilpatrick to unite the two into the subfamily Hydrochoerinae within the Caviidae. Based on use of a molecular clock approach, Hydrochoerus appears to have diverged from Kerodon in the late Middle Miocene (about 12 million years ago).

It is one of the largest medical organizations in the United States, with 134,600 members in 50 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam, as well as internationally. The AAFP was instrumental in establishing family medicine - a derivative of classical general practice - as medicine's 20th primary specialty. The AMA's Council on Medical Education and the independent American Board of Medical Specialties granted approval to a certifying board in family medicine on February 8, 1969. The AAFP is headquartered in Leawood, Kansas. ==Mission== The mission of the AAFP is to improve the health of patients, families and communities by serving the needs of members with professionalism and creativity. ==Strategic Objectives== To fulfill its mission, the AAFP's strategic objectives include: * Support and sustain comprehensive family medicine practices by advocating for models of payment reform that result in greater investment in family medicine. * Reduce administrative complexity by reducing point-of-care administrative functions that detract from patient care activities, or do not add value. * Equip members with clinical expertise to improve individual and population health by providing broad scope, personalized learning opportunities for members and other learners through relevant educational venues and formats. * Grow a diverse family physician workforce by raising awareness around the importance of family medicine. The AAFP also provides patients with free educational resources on its consumer health site. ==Structure== The AAFP is governed by a Congress of Delegates composed of two delegates from each of its 55 constituent chapters, as well as from resident and student groups, new physicians, and the special constituencies (women, minorities, international medical graduates, and LGBTQs). The Congress meets annually immediately prior to the Academy's Family Medicine Experience (FMX) event (formerly known as Scientific Assembly) and has sole power to establish policies and define principles. These policies are carried out between annual meetings by the Board of Directors and a number of standing and special commissions and committees. Delegates to the Congress of Delegates elect the Board, which in turn appoints commission and committee members. Constituent chapters are organized similarly. ==Publications== *AAFP News \\\\- the official news publication of the American Academy of Family Physicians *American Family Physician - an editorially independent official peer-reviewed, clinical review medical journal for physicians and other health care professionals. *Family Practice Management \\\\- a peer-reviewed, practice improvement journal dedicated to offering practical ideas for better practice, better patient care, and a better work life for family physicians. *Annals of Family Medicine - a collaborative effort with six family medicine organizations ==See also== *Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics (ALSO) *American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM) *American Osteopathic Board of Family Physicians (AOBFP) *American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians *World Organization of Family Doctors (Wonca) ==References== ==External links== * *American Family Physician - a journal by the AAFP *Family Practice Management - a journal by the AAFP *Annals of Family Medicine - a collaborative journal of the six family medicine organizations *familydoctor.org - The AAFP's patient education site.

Following on from his previous band Random Task, Ben Jorgensen taught himself guitar and later recruited additional members to form Armor for Sleep. With some buzz, and the addition of manager Gabe Saporta, the band recorded their debut album with Ariel Rechtshaid at two studios in California: El Barrio (in Van Nuys) and Standard Electrical (in Venice Beach). Dream to Make Believe mixed the space rock of Hum with the emo pop of the Get Up Kids; it tackled the topics of dreaming, time-travel and space. Armor for Sleep formally announced they had signed to independent label Equal Vision Records in early 2003, and went on two tours following this. Dream to Make Believe was released on June 3, where it was met with a generally positive reaction from music critics, with some finding it a highly enjoyable listen. Exclaim! included it at number seven on their list of the best punk albums of the year. The album was promoted with four US tours, continuing into mid-2004. Music videos were released for the title-track and \\"My Town\\" in early and mid-2004 respectively. ==Background and production== Influenced by local acts Lifetime and Saves the Day, Ben Jorgensen formed the punk rock act Random Task with friends from school. Though he was initially a drummer, he started playing guitar when his bandmates would leave their instruments at his mom's home. The group attracted attention from two record labels, however, the members' parents were \\"too scared at the time to let us do anything like that.\\" Before Jorgensen started college, he spent the preceding season writing material and taped two songs at a local studio. He wished to record more, but felt daunted by the track of playing every instrument by himself, he recruited bassist Anthony Dilonno, drummer Nash Breen and guitarist PJ DeCicco (the latter two were cousins of Jorgensen). They soon began attracting buzz; they were due to appear on a Victory Records compilation, though were later taken off. In April 2002, it was rumored that the band would be releasing their debut album through independent label Equal Vision Records later in the year. Gabe Saporta of Midtown became the group's manager; Saporta viewed Jorgensen as a younger brother-type of figure and wanted to help him avoid issues in the music industry that he experienced with Midtown. After the producer the band enlisted for their debut went missing, Saporta put them in contact with Ariel Rechtshaid. They recorded their debut album in August at El Barrio in Van Nuys, California and Standard Electrical Recorders in Venice Beach, California. Rechtshaid acted as the producer and handled engineering, with additional engineering from Chris Fudurich. Chris Knight served as the assistant at Standard Electrical. Rechtshaid mixed the recordings, before they were mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood, California. ==Composition== Musically, the sound of Dream to Make Believe mixed space rock in the vein of Hum with emo pop in the style of the Get Up Kids. Comparisons were drawn musically and lyrically to Jimmy Eat World and Further Seems Forever, while Jorgensen's vocals were compared to Legends of Rodeo frontman John Ralston. DeCicco said they were attempting to differ themselves from their contemporises with the space rock sound, they \\"wanted to almost bring like Thursday meets Radiohead and put it somewhere in between, and just kind of give it a little more.\\" The album is based on one theme, which evolved out of a poetry class Jorgensen took while in college. Though he disliked the class, he realized \\"since you're forced to write in one specific way your originality can come through.\\" Jorgensen's lyrics were centered around inspection, with elements of darkness and melancholy,Hinke 2003, p. 75 and tackling the topics of dreaming, space and time-travel. Rechtshaid contributed synthesizers to the recordings. The opening track is an instrumental titled \\"Armor for Sleep\\", which lasts for 45 seconds. ==Release== Demos of songs that would feature on the album were hosted on the group's website,Sciarretto 2003, p. 21 namely of the songs \\"All Warm\\", \\"Being Your Walls\\", \\"The Wanderers Guild\\" and \\"Slip Like Space\\". Armor for Sleep formally announced their signing to Equal Vision on January 18, 2003. In February and March, the group went on tour with Hey Mercedes. In May and June, the group went on tour with A Static Lullaby, Time in Malta and the Bled, and performed at The Bamboozle festival. Dream to Make Believe was released through Equal Vision on June 3; a release show was held for a crowd of 500 people. The Japanese edition, released in early 2005, included the bonus track \\"Pointless Forever\\". In November and December, the group supported Vendetta Red on their headlining US tour. On March 8, a music video for \\"Dream to Make Believe\\" was posted on MTVu.com. In March, the group went on the Equal Vision Records Tour with Bane and Silent Drive. Between late April and early June, the group went on a US tour with Midtown and Your Enemies Friends. They were supported on select dates by Time and Distance, the Working Title, Stars Hide Fire, Vise Versa, Emanuel and Lance's Hero. On July 1, a music video for \\"My Town\\" was posted online. The video was directed by Andrew Paul. In July and August, the group went on tour with Fall Out Boy, Bayside, the Academy Is... and Name Taken. Also in August, the group performed at Krazyfest. ==Reception== Exclaim! ranked it at number seven on their Best Punk Album of the year list. Dream to Make Believe received generally positive reviews from music critics. In Music We Trust writer Vinnie Apicella opened his review by calling it \\"an amazing record\\" by \\"talented musicians\\". The release set itself apart from other works by its thematic choice; it saw the group incorporate \\"edgy and quick minor chording technique accentuated by mild harmonic runs, lingering resonance, and Ben Jorgensen's thoughtful croon.\\" Exclaim! Jasamine White-Gluz said it was a \\"beautifully\\" crafted record, encapsulating \\"a sort of naive innocence that probably wouldn't be possible\\" if Jorgensen was \\"old enough to drink.\\" She complimented the group for coming up with \\"the perfect emo record without being too cheesy or clich√©\\". Kaj Roth ofMelodic said despite the members' ages, they made \\"quite a good debut\\", delivering \\"good songs in a good performance.\\" AllMusic reviewer Kurt Morris said the release \\"showcases another band partaking in the propagation of the emo movement\\" with \\"slight variations have been made to the sound so as to distinguish them\\" from their peers. Though he clarified, \\"[t]hat's not to say that what's here isn't good\\", the usage of \\"hooks and some good lyrics are key and come in at the right places\\". Punknews.org staff member Megan said only the pre-release demos our the only highlights on the alum, with the rest being \\"a slow drudge of songs that don't really evoke any emotion.\\" She criticized Jorgensen's voice as \\"often sound[ing] whiny and nasal\\", and since they are the \\"focal point of the music, they shouldn't sound so horrid. It's almost like nails on a chalkboard.\\" LAS Magazine writer Jonah Flicker bluntly said the group \\"isn't doing anything new, and not much good either.\\" As \\"excuses and half-assed endorsements a good record do not make. Let Armor for Sleep take a nice long nap.\\" ==Track listing== All songs written by Ben Jorgensen. ==Personnel== Personnel per booklet.

The bay and the settlement were renamed Sovetskaya Gavan in 1922. During World War II, construction was begun on a railway from the right bank of the Amur River near Komsomolsk-on-Amur to the Pacific coast, with Sovetskaya Gavan chosen as the endpoint. Sovetskaya Gavan was granted town status in 1941; the railway reached the town in 1945. This section of railway was the first section to be completed of what would later become the Baikal-Amur Mainline. From 1950 until 1954, the town was the site of the prison camp Ulminlag of the gulag system. In 1958, the town's northern neighborhood, on the Vanino Bay, was separated into a separate urban-type settlement of Vanino. In 1963-1964, six sounding rockets of \\"Kosmos 2\\"-type were launched.

He was one of the Eight Witnesses of the Book of Mormon's golden plates. Whitmer was also the first official Church Historian and a member of the presidency of the church in Missouri. ==Biography== Whitmer was born in York, Pennsylvania, to Peter Whitmer, Sr. and Mary Musselman. By the 1820s, the Whitmer family had moved to a farm in Fayette, in New York's Finger Lakes area. ===Foundation of the Latter Day Saint movement=== Whitmer's brother David and his entire family became early believers in Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. Whitmer was baptized into the movement by Oliver Cowdery in June 1829, nearly a year prior to the formal organization of the Church of Christ. In that same month, Whitmer became one of eight men who signed a testimony that they had handled and been shown the golden plates. Known as the \\"Testimony of the Eight Witnesses\\", the statement was printed in the first edition of the Book of Mormon and has been included in almost every subsequent edition. The church was formally organized on April 6, 1830. Whitmer was one of the earliest members and he was ordained an elder of the church on June 9. The next year, on March 8, 1831, Smith said that he received a revelation from God, calling Whitmer to \\"write and keep a regular history\\" of the church. This revelation was printed by Latter Day Saints as Book of Commandments 50, and in the Doctrine and Covenants (originally section 63, the revelation is now section 47 of the LDS Church edition). ===Leader of the church in Missouri=== Later in 1831, Whitmer joined the growing number of Latter Day Saints in Jackson County, Missouri. Local opposition to Mormon settlement in the county resulted in the expulsion of most of the Latter Day Saints by the summer of 1833. Whitmer, along with many of the others, took refugee in neighboring Clay County. At a July 3, 1834, conference of the church, Whitmer's brother David was called to be the president of the church in Missouri. John Whitmer and W. W. Phelps were called as David's counselors. Because David returned to Kirtland, John Whitmer and Phelps were left to preside in his absence. Whitmer wrote several petitions to Missouri's governor, Daniel Dunklin, asking that the Latter Day Saints be allowed to return to their lands in Jackson County. Working with sympathetic non-Mormon residents in Clay County, including Alexander Doniphan, Whitmer and Phelps began to purchase land northeast of Clay in what became a new county, set aside for Mormon settlement. Together with Phelps, Whitmer purchased land for the church in his name in what became Caldwell County and founded the town of Far West. ===Whitmer's excommunication=== Problems at church headquarters in Kirtland relating to the Kirtland Safety Society bank caused Smith and Sidney Rigdon to relocate to Far West in early 1838. A brief leadership struggle ensued, which led to the excommunication of the entire Whitmer family as well as Oliver Cowdery, Phelps, and others. These men continued to live in Far West for a time and became known as the \\"dissenters\\". Sidney Rigdon, in his \\"Salt Sermon\\", warned the dissenters to leave the county and his words were soon followed up by perceived threats from the newly formed Mormon confraternity known as the Danites. The Whitmer family moved to Richmond in neighboring Ray County, Missouri. Their complaints and those of the other dissenters are sometimes cited as one of the causes of the 1838 Mormon War. This conflict between Latter Day Saints and their neighbors in northwestern Missouri ended with the expulsion of the former, who eventually relocated to a new headquarters at Nauvoo, Illinois. ===Whitmer returns to Far West=== Whitmer's parents and his brother David remained in Richmond for the rest of their lives, but John and his own family returned to Far West. Emptied of the Latter Day Saints, Far West became a ghost town. Many of its houses were moved off to other settlements, and Far West lost the county seat to nearby Kingston. Whitmer continued to live in Far West, buying up land (including the proposed temple site) and eventually amassing a large farm. He occasionally gave visitors tours of the former settlement. After Smith's death in 1844, several leaders asserted their claims to be his rightful successor. Among these was Whitmer's brother David. In 1847, Whitmer was briefly part of a renewed Church of Christ (Whitmerite). Whitmer died in Far West. He is buried in Kingston Cemetery in nearby Kingston. ==Whitmer's manuscript== After his call as Church Historian, Whitmer began to write a record entitled The Book of John Whitmer, Kept by Commandment. His book begins with an account of events leading up to the relocation of the church's headquarters from New York to Kirtland, Ohio. He discusses many of the troubles experienced by the Latter Day Saints in Missouri and ends the work with an account of his own excommunication in March 1838. Afterwards, a continuation tells of the mistreatment he felt he and the other dissenters had received at the hands of Smith and Rigdon. Whitmer's manuscript is now in the archives of the Community of Christ. == John Whitmer Historical Association == On September 18, 1972, historians and scholars associated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church) founded the John Whitmer Historical Association (JWHA) as \\"an independent scholarly society composed of individuals of various religious faiths who share a lively interest in ... Latter Day Saint history, especially the history of the Community of Christ.\\" The association publishes two academic journals (John Whitmer Historical Association Journal and Restoration Studies) and a newsletter as well as holding conferences and lecture series and giving awards.http://www.jwha.info/ == References == *Bruce N.

Bromobenzene is used to introduce a phenyl group into other compounds. One method involves its conversion to the Grignard reagent, phenylmagnesium bromide. This reagent can be used, e.g. in the reaction with carbon dioxide to prepare benzoic acid. Other methods involve palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions such as the Suzuki reaction.

The two sides had arrived at something of a stalemate, with the Union army half-encircling Atlanta and the Confederate defenders staying behind their fortifications. ==The battle== Map of Lovejoy's Station Battlefield core and study areas by the (American Battlefield Protection Program). While Confederate Cavalry commander Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler was absent raiding Union supply lines from North Georgia to East Tennessee, Union Army commander Major General William T. Sherman sent cavalry Brigadier General Judson Kilpatrick to raid Confederate supply lines. Leaving on August 18, Kilpatrick hit the Atlanta & West Point Railroad that evening and disabled a small area of the track. Next, he proceeded for Lovejoy's Station on the Macon & Western Railroad. In transit, on August 19, Kilpatrick's men attacked the Jonesborough supply depot on the Macon & Western Railroad, burning great amounts of supplies. On August 20, they reached Lovejoy's Station and began their destruction. Confederate Infantry Dan Reynolds's Arkansas Brigade appeared and the raiders were forced to fight into the night, finally fleeing to prevent being surrounded. Although Kilpatrick had destroyed supplies and track at Lovejoy's Station, the railroad line was back in operation in two days. ==Other Lovejoy's Station actions== The National Park Service considers the August 20 action to be a battle, but there were three other military actions at Lovejoy in 1864: Brig. Gen. Edward M. McCook's cavalry raid of July 29 and July 30,the September 2 to September 6 action, and the November 16 cavalry action.Pfisterer, pp. 186, 190, 198. Historical archeology in 2010 documented unexplored portions of the battlefield that existed along McDonough-Jonesboro Road, east of U.S. Highway 41. ==The Battlefield Today== The area of this historic battle has mostly been lost due to suburban sprawl of Clayton and Henry Counties, Georgia. The last on the Henry County side are the site of a battle of another kind. Local citizens, preservationists, and historians are fighting to stop the development of this rural farmland. The local community has offered to buy back the land to develop a historic park to commemorate the Civil War battle. Henry County, Georgia announced the official opening of the Nash Farm Battlefield Park, which was the scene of Kilpatrick's Raid on August 20 and the Infantry action from September 2 to September 6, 1864. Plans for the battlefield include converting the farmhouse into a museum and renovating the barn into a public meetings and event facility, as well as walking trails throughout the property. The museum, called the Nash Farm Battlefield Museum, was closed permanently on June 1, 2017.http://www.henryherald.com/news/nash-farm-battlefield-museum-to-close- after-commissioner-requests- removal/article_3a80ebfb-c5e6-55e3-9079-3abcd22dbfa9.html A survey, \\"Summary Report of History and Archeology of the Nash Farm Battlefield\\", was completed in August 2007. On March 12, 2008, Lovejoy Station was placed for the second time on the Civil War Preservation Trust's List of Most Endangered Civil War Battlefields. In 2010, the National Park Service published a revised assessment of the Civil War battles in Georgia, in which the Battle of Lovejoy was reassessed in terms of its military significance and its geographic extent (ABPPABPP) Contemporary sources (such as Four Years in the Saddle, by William Leontes CurryCurry, pp. 183-184.), state that fighting on August 20 was continuous from Lovejoy to Walnut Creek. ==See also== * Atlanta in the Civil War ==References== *National Park Service battle description * Phisterer, Frederick, Statistical Record of the Armies of the United States, Castle Books, 1883, . * Elliott, Daniel T., and Tracy M.

Widely regarded as one of the originators of the Dutch trance sound, the group have produced a number of dancefloor hits since their conception. Although the two members of the group (Benno de Goeij and Piet Bervoets) had worked together before, Rank 1 (a name first used in 1999) was their first project with commercial success. ==History== The first Rank 1 release was an EP containing \\"The Citrus Juicer\\" and \\"Black Snow\\". Their biggest hit commercially was the 1999 track that followed up to that EP called \\"Airwave\\", which reached No. 10 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 25 in the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. This was later re-released by Rank 1 remixed with added vocals as \\"Breathing (Airwave 2003)\\", Ran3k 1 followed it up 11 years later with a modern style remix of Airwave in 2014 bringing the trance juggernaut into the 21st century. They also provided the base for a mash up with Donna Williams, as \\"True Love Never Dies\\", which was later vocally re-recorded using Kelly Llorenna, by Flip & Fill. In 2011, Airwave was voted the number 1 Trance Classic of all time in the Trance Top 1000 poll. In 2013, Airwave reached number 7. In September 2000, they performed the track \\"Many Miles Too Soon\\" live at Trance Energy as a tribute to the late Miles Stutterheim, younger brother to Duncan Stutterheim, one of the founders of the Dutch event organiser ID&T.; A year later this track was released as \\"Such Is Life\\", with added vocals by Shanokee and chosen as the anthem of Sensation 2001, the first edition where visitors were asked to appear dressed in white. A year later they released \\"Awakening\\" as the single preceding their debut album \\"Symsonic\\". The album was released with a CD containing downtempo versions of Airwave and Such Is Life as well as a some brand new tracks including the title track, a short version of \\"The Citrus Juicer\\", \\"T.T.C.\\", \\"Passage To The Unknown\\", \\"Still In My Mind\\" and more. The album also included a DVD with a few videoclips of their singles up till then as well as their live performance at Trance Energy 2002. 2003 saw the re-release of Airwave with vocals by Aino Laos which were written by Jan Lochel. In a recorded interview, Benno explained that Breathing was released to back up the album release in Germany. By the end of the year, Rank 1 finally released their single Symsonic under the new title \\"It's Up To You\\", with added vocals by Shanokee. Unlike the classically inspired Album version, these mixes were produced in the more typical 4x4 driven uplifting Trance style, especially the \\"Instrumental Dub\\" and \\"Dub Vocal Mix\\". The next year saw the release of the Symsonic album sampler titled \\"Unreleased Tracks\\" which contained extended mixes of \\"Conspiracy\\", \\"Cosmomatic\\" and \\"Down From The Deep\\". Shortly thereafter, Rank 1 radically changed their trademark euphoric sound and released an EP containing \\"Beats At Rank-1 Dotcom\\", a brand new Tech Trance record which ID&T; would later pick up as the Trance Energy 2005 Theme. The flipside contained \\"After Me\\", a breaks driven string-laced track. The male vocals on this track were rumored to have been performed by Benno de Goeij himself. This would be the start of Rank 1's radical sound shift every few years which would lead to some genre-blending releases. In February 2005, Rank 1 performed live at Trance Energy for the third time. During this live show they performed a track which was only made for the event. However, the crowd's reaction to it was so immense that Piet and Benno decided to release it as an official track called \\"Top Gear\\". This would happen over the summer with another two-track EP: \\"Opus 17\\" was present at the flipside and was a moody Trance track unlike its unique heavy Techno-Techtrance influenced B-side. In February 2006, Piet was interviewed for a WiLDCHiLD event. In this interview he stated that their second album was in progress and that they had made quite some diverse tunes for it, including a breaks track with the potential title \\"2 Drunk 2 Funk\\". As of 2017, this track has not been revealed yet. Piet also clarified about the mysterious unreleased and untitled \\"Rank 1 vs. Marco V\\" collaboration track that was also mentioned in the FAQ section of their old website. There were no official single releases during 2006 but in 2007 both \\"This World Is Watching Me\\" (with Armin van Buuren and Kush) and \\"Life Less Ordinary\\" (with Alex M.O.R.P.H.) were released. Both tracks mixed Electro-driven beats with Trancey strings and saw yet another sound shift from Rank 1. Life Less Ordinary also received an experimental Rank 1 interpretation in the guise of \\"A Less Ordinary Rank 1 Remix\\". Early 2008 saw them release another Electro-style collaboration, this time it was a collaboration with Jochen Miller, titled \\"And Then...\\". Rank 1 made an own version of the track which they titled \\"Rank 1's Minimal Progressive Techno Electro Trance Mix\\". It was darker and heavier than the original and had a more Techno-driven twist. The duos' track: \\"L.E.D There Be Light\\", was chosen as the Trance Energy 2009 Anthem, as well as the background track to the 2009 Electric Daisy Carnival commercial. This track combined the soft-loud synth dynamic from And Then with sweeping strings and more Trancey elements. It leaked out in late 2008, which led to the early release of the \\"Special Download Mix\\". The track was officially released in February 2009, with remixes by Wippenberg, Marcel Woods as well as an alternative \\"Laserlight Rework\\" by Rank 1 themselves. In 2010, the song was formally remixed by Cold Blank. It is the most successful remix to date, reaching No. 10 on Beatport's Top 100 Electro House Chart. It also landed a release on Ministry Of Sound's Trance Nation 2010 compilation. There were also released some another remixes by tyDi & Trent McDermott, Yvan & Dan Daniel and LoKo. Their next track, \\"Symfo,\\" was the self-titled Sunrise Festival Theme 2009 and was released only five months after L.E.D. There Be Light. This track received remixes by Marcus Schossow and The Prime Sins, as well as a more House-driven \\"Rank 1's That Side Mix\\". In 2010, Rank 1 and Miller released another collaboration which was chosen as the theme to the Polish Entrance 2010 event called \\"The Great Escape\\". Armin van Buuren even played it during his short satellite-connection gig during Trance Energy 2010. On February 11, Benno tweeted there would be an alternative non-Trance Rank 1 Remix of The Great Escape but as of 2017, this version has not been revealed yet. Whether it has been cancelled or not remains unclear. Two weeks later, Benno tweeted that they would start their own radioshow. Indeed, April 6 saw the start of their monthly one-hour radioshow \\"Rank 1's Radio Rush\\" on Afterhours FM, which is aired every first Tuesday of the month between 20:00 - 21:00 CET. A forum on the Rank 1 Hyve contains an updated track list of all the episodes, as well as a list of the (old) Rank 1 Classics played so far. As the summer approached, another collaboration saw the light of day, this time Rank 1 teamed up with Nic Chagall and Wippenberg to release \\"100\\", the self- explanatory track to celebrate High Contrast Recordings reaching the 100th milestone release. The vinyl release of the track was a limited edition pressed on gold. Similar to 2006, 2011 saw no official single releases. The two singles to follow this \\"radio silence\\" were released in February and March respectively, with the Trouse driven \\"Wild And Perfect Day\\" providing their third collaboration with Jochen Miller (with vocal support by Sarah Bettens) whilst \\"Witness\\" was their vocal Trance collaboration in tandem with Cerf, Mitiska & Jaren. On April 23 the guys announced they had almost finished a brand new track, so far without vocals. After various cryptic Facebook and Twitter updates alike, on the 15th of October they finally revealed that their third 2012 release would be a Rank 1 solo track called \\"7 Instead Of 8\\". The single's title refers to its 7/8 time signature. On December 21, they revealed a 30-second snippet of their collaboration 'Elements Of Nature' with Belgium Trance artist M.I.K.E.. This collaboration was initiated by a Twitter user under the name 'Ramballo'. This single was released by the end of January 2013 and received much positive feedback for its Classic Trance vibe and was even rated an 8.5/10 by the DJ Mag. On March 13, Conjure One revealed that a Rank 1 Remix for his new single \\"Under The Gun\\" would debut during Rank 1's set at ASOT #600 in Mumbai. Just one day later, Rank 1 themselves announced a brand new single 'Floorlifter' to debut on the very same event. A month later the Rank 1 Remix for Italian Trance artist Giuseppe Ottaviani's single 'Love Will Bring It All Around' was released. Over the course of the summer, Rank 1 announced to be working on a third single. As October passed by, they revealed their new single titled '13.11.11' which combined the track's duration with its release date and tempo./photo/1 Their first 2014 single was released on March 17, a collaboration with the German producer Dennis Sheperd titled 'Freudenrausch'. On August 8, their track Airwave was re-released in a modern 129 BPM rework to celebrate 15 years of the Rank 1 project: 'Airwave (21st Century Mix)' peaked at #4 in the BeatPort Trance Top 100 chart. On December 16, DI.FM aired the 56th Radio Rush episode, which was also the radioshow's finale. Early 2015 saw M.I.K.E. share an instagram picture of a project he was working on: the title of the project read \\"MIKEPush vs Rank1 - #JUNO Tracks\\". On June 18, this collaboration was revealed as the guys' newest collaboration \\"Juno\\". It debuted on episode #718 of Armin van Buuren's A State Of Trance Radioshow as 'Tune Of The Week'. On September 13 both Rank 1 and M.I.K.E. tweeted the same cryptic message: a google search of the sentences they both used seemed to be referring to zenith. A couple of weeks later it turned out that the guys had indeed teamed up again for a third collaboration which they named \\"Zenith\\": it was premiered by Markus Schulz on his Global DJ Broadcast radioshow. It would go on to garner massive support from Markus throughout the next few months. At the end of May 2016, Rank 1 used a cryptic tweet to reveal a new single: it merely read \\"03.06.2016\\" and was accompanied by coverart depicting a highway at dawn. In the following days, they revealed they had finished a brand new rework of their old 2000 Remix for Cygnus X - Superstring. Armin van Buuren granted them Tune Of The Week status once more on ASOT #766 and during the episode, Benno gave a short background story on the track: the piano they used in Superstring was the same one that Armin used to play as a child. A month later, Torsten Stenzel, better known as York, released his album Traveller which featured a collaboration with Rank 1 titled \\"This World Is So Amazing\\", alongside vocals by Lola Grover, The collaboration was officially released on November 1. The package included remixes by Maglev and Dreamy alongside the original mix. A few silent months followed. Then, on July 7, 2017, Rank 1 revealed that they would be part of the Dreamstate SoCal line-up, a multi-day Trance event that would take place in the final weekend of November. On Saturday November 25th their first live performance in 4,5 years time took place and the guys seized the opportunity to showcase four brand new tracks alongside the untitled track they performed over various festivals during summer '12. As of December 9, no new material has been released. On July 27 2018, Cosmic Gate released their remix of L.E.D. There Be Light, but other than that there were no new releases that year. When 2019 had got underway, the guys released a brand new single at last: for this occasion they finally delivered a collaboration with Marco V which they titled \\"We Finally Met\\". It was premiered on ASOT episode #902 on February 21 and was made Tune Of The Week by Armin. It was the only release they put out in 2019. For the celebration of the 950th episode of his radioshow, Armin decided he wanted to do something special so he asked Piet & Benno if they were interested in doing a liveshow at the Jaarbeurs to which they agreed. Two and a half years onward from Dreamstate the guys went live again, albeit this time they combined the live playing with some mega-mixing tricks to fit 11 tracks into 30 minutes: they played two brand new untitled tracks, as well as two tracks from their Dreamstate show. On July 31st, the live set was released on Spotify and with it, the previously untitled tracks finally received names. In order of appearance, these were: \\"Transatlantic Communication\\", \\"Predictive Memory\\", \\"No Name\\" and \\"Paris Nice Cannes\\". ==Discography== ===Albums=== * 2002 Symsonic including \\"Symsonic\\", \\"Cosmomatic\\", \\"Conspiracy\\", \\"T.T.C.\\", \\"Down From The Deep\\", \\"Equilibrium\\", \\"Passage To The Unknown\\" and \\"Still In My Mind\\" * 2020 Live at ASOT 950 including \\"Transatlantic Communication\\", \\"Predictive Memory\\", \\"No Name\\" and \\"Paris Nice Cannes\\" ===Singles=== ===As Rank 1=== * 1999 \\"Black Snow / The Citrus Juicer\\" * 1999 \\"Airwave\\" (Innercity Theme 1999) * 2000 \\"Untitled\\" (with Marco V) (Unreleased) * 2001 \\"Such Is Life\\" (with Shanokee) (Sensation Anthem 2001) * 2002 \\"Awakening\\" (with Olga Zegers) * 2003 \\"Breathing (Airwave 2003)\\" (with Aino Laos) * 2003 \\"It's Up To You (Symsonic)\\" (with Shanokee) * 2004 \\"Beats At Rank-1 Dotcom (Trance Energy Anthem 2005) / After Me\\" * 2004 \\"Unreleased Tracks From The Album Symsonic\\" (inc.

In 2001, the parish had a population of 263, increasing to 284 in the 2011 Census. Flecknoe is the largest settlement in the parish. The old village of Wolfhampcote is west of the A45 road near Braunston in Northamptonshire, and can be reached by a track from the main A45 road, or by a lane from Flecknoe. The village was abandoned sometime in the late 14th century and is classified as a deserted medieval village. Local legend suggests that the village was wiped out by the Black Death brought in by refugees from London, but there is no evidence to support this. It is much more likely that a few cottages still remained after the great plague and after struggling to maintain their land the villagers drifted off to more prosperous places leaving the Lord of the Manor to clear the land for sheep grazing as best he could. The village is shown as Wulfencote on the Christopher Saxton map of 1637. Today the only remains of the village are a cottage, a farmhouse, and the old vicarage, located some distance away. The most notable surviving feature of the village is the Church of St Peter, which stands apparently in the middle of nowhere in a field. The church has been restored on several occasions, most recently in the 1970s by an organisation called the Friends of Friendless Churches. The church is today managed by the Churches Conservation Trust and is used only once or twice a year. The area around the old village is rich in industrial archaeology. The Oxford Canal passes to the north of the site, but this section is the result of a straightening-out dating from the 1830s, the more southerly original route (constructed in the 1770s) having followed a much more winding course, remains of which can still be traced through the area. There are also the remains of two abandoned railway lines, the first being the old Weedon to Leamington Spa (via Daventry) railway, part of the London and North Western Railway (later the LMS), which closed to passengers in September 1958 and to freight in December 1963, and the second being the Great Central Main Line, which closed to all traffic in September 1966.

He made his d√©but in 1998 with a collection entitled Of the Square Man, containing of fifty-odd highly individualistic poems. This debut won him the 1999 C. Buddingh‚Äô poetry prize. As well as a poet, Pfeijffer was for some time a Greek scholar on the staff of Leiden University. He wrote a dissertation on the poetry of Pindar and published a history of classical literature for the general reader. Regarding his own poetry he has outspoken views, not just in his oft-quoted programmatic opening poem \\"Farewell Dinner,\\" in which he dismisses the hermetic Hans Faverey and calls for \\"butter-baked images / and bulimic verse\\". Pfeijffer's poetic polemics leave no room for doubt as to what kind of poetry he prefers. He feels akin to Lucebert, and he abhors the paper verse of introverted hermetics and meek-hearted dreamers (\\"stumble, stiff romantic, mumble on\\"). Poetry should have life, and preferably, in Lucebert‚Äôs words, \\"life in full\\".

The date of his birth is unknown, but probably not much earlier than c. 1290. He died as a monk in exile before 1330. Ivan II succeeded his father Smilets as emperor in TƒÉrnovo in 1298. The new ruler was a child, and the government was in the hands of his mother, the unnamed daughter of sebastocrator Constantine Palaiologos and niece of Michael VIII Palaiologos called simply \\"Smiltsena\\" (\\"wife of Smilets\\"). The widowed empress apparently defeated Smilets' brothers Radoslav and Voysil (Vojsil), who sought refuge in the Byzantine Empire and entered into Byzantine service. To meet this threat and the invasion of the Mongol prince Chaka, Ivan II's mother sought an alliance with Aldimir (Eltimir), the brother of the former ruler George Terter I. Aldimir was accordingly married to Smilets' daughter Marina (Marija) and, if this had not happened earlier, was given the title of despotƒìs and invested with an extensive landholding around KrƒÉn. In 1299 the Bulgarian government attempted unsuccessfully to make an alliance with Serbian King Stefan Milutin to the exclusion of the latter's projected alignment with the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos. The regents of Ivan II were unable to strengthen their position, and abandoned TƒÉrnovo to Chaka, who installed himself as emperor in 1299. Ivan II and his retinue settled in the possessions of Aldimir, where they may have remained even after the accession of Aldimir's nephew Theodore Svetoslav to the throne in 1300. In 1305 Ivan II's mother was negotiating with the Byzantine government in Constantinople on behalf of either Aldimir or her son, but with Aldimir's subjugation by Theodore Svetoslav in the same year, the family disappears into obscurity. Ivan II spent the remainder of his life as an exile in Byzantium, under the name I≈çannƒìs Komnƒìnos Doukas Angelos Branas Palaiologos, and shortly before his death he became a monk under the name Joasaph.

In 1889, he was elected to Brantford City Council as an alderman and was elected mayor in 1899. In 1906 he was president of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association. He fought during World War I with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In the 1917 federal election he ran unsuccessfully as an independent candidate in the riding of Brant. He lost to the Government candidate, John Harold. In 1921, he was appointed lieutenant-governor of Ontario and served as King George V's representative until 1927. From 1929 to 1944, he served as chancellor of the University of Western Ontario. In 1934, he retired as president of the Cockshutt Plow Company and became chairman of the board, which he held until his death. In 1896, he married Isabelle Rolls.

It is similar to the third-order intercept point in electrical systems. Four-wave mixing can be compared to the intermodulation distortion in standard electrical systems. It is a parametric nonlinear process, in that the energy of the incoming photons is conserved. FWM is a phase-sensitive process, in that the efficiency of the process is strongly affected by phase matching conditions. == Mechanism == Energy level diagram for a non-degenerate four- wave mixing process. The top energy level could be a real atomic or molecular level (resonant four-wave mixing) or a virtual level, far detuned off- resonance. This diagram describes the four-wave mixing interaction between frequencies f1, f2, f3 and f4. When three frequencies (f1, f2, and f3) interact in a nonlinear medium, they give rise to a fourth frequency (f4) which is formed by the scattering of the incident photons, producing the fourth photon. Given inputs f1, f2, and f3, the nonlinear system will produce : \\\\pm f_{1} \\\\pm f_{2} \\\\pm f_{3} From calculations with the three input signals, it is found that 12 interfering frequencies are produced, three of which lie on one of original incoming frequencies. Note that these three frequencies which lie at the original incoming frequencies are typically attributed to self-phase modulation and cross-phase modulation, and are naturally phase-matched unlike FWM. ===Sum and Difference frequency generation=== Two common forms of four-wave mixing are dubbed sum frequency generation and difference frequency generation. In sum frequency generation three fields are input and the output is a new high frequency field at the sum of the three input frequencies. In difference frequency generation, the typical output is the sum of two minus the third. A condition for efficient generation of FWM is phase matching: the associated k-vectors of the four components must add to zero when they are plane waves. This becomes significant since sum and difference frequencies generation is often enhanced when resonance in the mixing media is exploited. In many configurations the sum of the first two photons will be tuned close to a resonant state. However, close to resonances the index of refraction changes rapidly and makes addition four co-linear k-vectors fail to add exactly to zero‚Äîthus long mixing path lengths are not always possible as the four component lose phase lock. Consequently, beams are often focused both for intensity but also to shorten the mixing zone. In gaseous media an often overlooked complication is that light beams are rarely plane waves but are often focused for extra intensity, this can add an addition pi-phase shift to each k-vector in the phase matching condition. It is often very hard to satisfy this in the sum frequency configuration but it is more easily satisfied in the difference frequency configuration(where the pi phase shifts cancel out). As a result, difference frequency is usually more broadly tunable and easier to set up than sum frequency generation, making it preferable as a light source even though it's less quantum efficient than sum frequency generation. The special case of sum- frequency generation where all the input photons have the same frequency (and wavelength) is Third-Harmonic Generation (THG). === Degenerate four-wave mixing === Four-wave mixing is also present if only two components interact. In this case the term : f_{0} = f_{1} + f_{1} - f_{2} couples three components, thus generating so-called degenerate four-wave mixing, showing identical properties to the case of three interacting waves. == Adverse effects of FWM in fiber-optic communications == FWM is a fiber-optic characteristic that affects wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) systems, where multiple optical wavelengths are spaced at equal intervals or channel spacing. The effects of FWM are pronounced with decreased channel spacing of wavelengths (such as in dense WDM systems) and at high signal power levels. High chromatic dispersion decreases FWM effects, as the signals lose coherence, or in other words, the phase mismatch between the signals increases. The interference FWM caused in WDM systems is known as interchannel crosstalk. FWM can be mitigated by using uneven channel spacing or fiber that increases dispersion. For the special case where the three frequencies are close to degenerate, then optical separation of the difference frequency can be technically challenging. : f_{ijk} = f_{i} + f_{j} - f_{k}, \\\\mathrm{where}\\\\, i, j eq k == Applications of FWM == FWM finds applications in optical phase conjugation, parametric amplification, supercontinuum generation, Vacuum Ultraviolet light generation and in microresonator based frequency comb generation. Parametric amplifiers and oscillators based on four-wave mixing use the third order nonlinearity, as opposed to most typical parametric oscillators which use the second-order nonlinearity. Apart from these classical applications, four-wave mixing has shown promise in the quantum optical regime for generating single photons, correlated photon pairs, squeezed light and entangled photons. ==See also== * Optical phase conjugation, phase conjugate mirror * Supercontinuum generation * Kerr frequency comb * Optical Kerr effect *Lugiato‚ÄìLefever equation ==References== ==External links== * Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology Category:Optics Category:Nonlinear optics Category:Photonics Category:Optical fiber Category:Frequency mixers ","title":"Four-wave mixing"},{"id":"1427976","text":"Lytton Commission members in Shanghai (Lord Lytton wearing a coat in center of photo) are the findings of the Lytton Commission, entrusted in 1931 by the League of Nations in an attempt to evaluate the Mukden Incident, which led to the Empire of Japan's seizure of Manchuria. The five-member commission headed by Victor Bulwer-Lytton of Great Britain announced its conclusions on October 1932. It stated that Japan was the aggressor, had wrongfully invaded Manchuria and that it should be returned to the Chinese. It also argued that the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo should not be recognized, and recommended Manchurian autonomy under Chinese sovereignty. The League of Nations General Assembly adopted the report, and Japan quit the League. The recommendations went into effect after Japan surrendered in 1945. == The Commission == The Lytton Commission, headed by Lytton, included four other members, one each from the US (Major General Frank Ross McCoy), Germany (Dr. Heinrich Schnee), Italy (Luigi Aldrovandi Marescotti), and France (General Henri Claudel).Five Wise Westerners Time Magazine 10 Oct 1932 The group spent six weeks in Manchuria in spring 1932 (despite having been sent in December 1931) on a fact-finding mission after they had met government leaders in the Republic of China and in Japan. It was hoped that the report would defuse the hostilities between Japan and China and thus help maintain peace and stability in the Far East. == The Lytton Report == Lytton Commission, investigating the blast point of the railway. The Lytton Report contained an account of the situation in Manchuria before September 1931, when the Mukden Incident took place as the Japanese army (without authorization from the Japanese government) seized the large Chinese province of Manchuria.Robert H. Ferrell, \\"The Mukden Incident: September 18‚Äì19, 1931.\\" Journal of modern history 27.1 (1955): 66-72. in JSTOR The Report described the unsatisfactory features of the Chinese administration and giving weight to the various claims and complaints of Japan. It then proceeded with a narrative of the events in Manchuria subsequent to September 18, 1931, based on the evidence of many participants and on that of eyewitnesses. It devoted particular attention to the origins and development of the State of Manchukuo, which had already been proclaimed by the time the Commission reached Manchuria. It also covered the question of the economic interests of Japan both in Manchuria and China as a whole, and the nature and effects of the Chinese anti-Japanese boycott. Soviet Union interests in the region were also mentioned. Finally, the Commission submitted a study of the conditions to which, in its judgment, any satisfactory solution should conform, and made various proposals and suggestions as to how an agreement embodying these principles might be brought about. However, the report did not directly address one of its chief goals: the cause of the Mukden Incident. Instead, it simply stated the Japanese position (that the Chinese had been responsible), with no comment as to the truth or falsity of the Japanese claims.The Mukden Incident by Thomas Ferrell, Journal of Modern History March 1955 (see page 67), Although there was no doubt as to Japan's guilt among the five commission members,Memo from the US Ambassador in Japan to the US Secretary of State, 16 July 1932, Foreign Relations of the United States, Japan 1931-1941 (see pages 93-94), Claudel (the French delegate) insisted that Japan not be portrayed as the aggressor.Myopic Grandeur by John E. Dreifort (see pages 80-83) In spite of care to preserve impartiality between the conflicting views of China and Japan, the effect of the Report was regarded as a substantial vindication of the Chinese case on most fundamental issues. In particular, the Commission stated that the operations of the Imperial Japanese Army following on the Mukden incident could not be regarded as legitimate self-defence. Regarding Manchukuo, the Report concluded that the new State could not have been formed without the presence of Japanese troops; that it had no general Chinese support; and that it was not part of a genuine and spontaneous independent movement. Still, the report held that both China and Japan had legitimate grievances. Japan, it states, took advantage of questionable rights, and China obstructed by the exercise of her undoubted rights. The Geneva correspondent of the \\"Daily Telegraph\\" says: \\"The report, which was approved unanimously, proposes that China and Japan shall be given three months in which to accept or reject the recommendations. It is hoped that the parties will agree to direct negotiations.\\" The \\"Daily Telegraph\\" French correspondent says: \\"The report insists on the withdrawal of Japanese troops within the South Manchuria railway zone, and recommends the establishment of an organisation under the sovereignty of China to deal with conditions in Manchuria, taking due account of the rights and interests of Japan, and the formation of a committee of negotiation for the application of these and other recommendations.\\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16953340 == Consequences == In September 1932, even before the official announcement of the findings of the Lytton Report on October 2, 1932, was made public, the Japanese government extended official diplomatic recognition to the puppet government of Manchukuo. When the findings of the Report were announced before the General Assembly of the League of Nations, and a motion was raised to condemn Japan as an aggressor in February 1933, the Japanese delegation led by ambassador Yosuke Matsuoka walked out. Japan gave formal notice of its withdrawal from the League of Nations on March 27, 1933.

In the U.S., they range through southeastern California, southern Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico. ==Description== On alt= The back and wings of this bird are spotted and barred with a black and white zebra-like pattern. The neck, throat, belly and head are greyish-tan in color. The male has a small red cap on the top of the head. Females and juveniles are similar, but both lack the red cap of the adult male. White wing patches are prominent in flight. The dark tail has white bars on the central tail feathers. They range from in length. This woodpecker's voice is a rolling churr sound. It also makes a yip yip yip sound and a kee-u, kee-u, kee-u sound. Its drum is long and steady. ==Distribution & habitat== This woodpecker's habitat consists of low desert scrub typical of the Sonoran Desert. == Behavior and ecology == === Breeding === They build nests in holes made in saguaro cacti or mesquite trees. Cavities excavated by these woodpeckers in saguaro cacti (known as a \\"boot\\") are later used by a variety of other species, including the elf owl. There, they typically lay 3‚Äì4 white eggs, although as many as 6 or 7 have been noted. 23 broods are laid a year. Both sexes incubate and feed eggs. === Feeding === As a woodpecker, its diet is composed greatly of insects, which it gains from drilling into bark. Gila woodpeckers are omnivorous, and do take fruits, nectar, seeds, as well as lizards, eggs, worms, and even young chicks of small birds. They are even known to hang on human placed hummingbird feeders and sip up the nectar. == Status == The IUCN rates the species as least concern. It is an endangered species in California, where populations have suffered notably. Arizona populations remain strong. It was once found in Nevada, but has been extirpated from its range there. The effects of climate change could severely reduce available habitat. ==Gallery== File:Melanerpesuropygialis.JPGIn Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico File:Melanerpesuropygialisdrinking.JPGA Gila woodpecker drinking water ==References== * Robbins, C.S., Bruun, B., Zim, H.S.; Birds of North America.

These dates mark the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The 1939 season had below normal activity, with only six tropical storms, of which two became hurricanes and one became a major hurricane, equivalent to Category 3 status or higher on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The first tropical cyclone formed on June 12, and the last dissipated on November 6. All of the storms affected land to some extent. The first two cyclones of the season made landfall along the coast of the United States, collectively causing only minor damage. Hurricane Five, the strongest of the year, took a northeastern path through the western Atlantic, striking Bermuda on October 16. The fifth and final storm was a minimal hurricane that wrought damage throughout the western Caribbean Sea, most notably in Jamaica and Cuba.

Reports of the storm first came from the Mexican Weather Service office in Chetumal, Quintana Roo, and during the afternoon of June 12, vessels just offshore recorded squally conditions and choppy seas. The cyclone moved northward, parallel to the coast of Belize, before moving over the northeastern corner of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. It continued steadily northward through the Gulf of Mexico, slowly strengthening to a peak of on June 14 with a minimum central pressure of . An area of high pressure to the north caused the storm to execute a counter-clockwise loop. A trough of low pressure turned it back to the north, and the cyclone made landfall near Mobile, Alabama, as a minimal tropical storm on June 16. Turning to the northwest, it quickly weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated on June 17 over Mississippi. In advance of the system, officials issued storm warnings for coastal areas of Alabama and western Florida, and residents in low-lying areas were advised to seek higher ground. Damage associated with the cyclone was generally minor, and only one life was lost when a boy fell into the swollen waters of a river and drowned. ===Hurricane Two=== On August 7, a tropical storm formed north of the Leeward Islands, likely from a tropical wave. It tracked to the west-northwest, slowly strengthening to a hurricane as it moved through the Bahamas on August 11. Later that day, it met the east coast of Florida, and crossed the state in around 15 hours. After weakening to a tropical storm, it quickly re-strengthened upon emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, and made another landfall near Apalachicola, Florida, on August 13. Over land, the cyclone slowed considerably and quickly deteriorated. By August 14, the storm had weakened to a tropical depression as it drifted through Alabama. The depression turned to the northeast, and remained a tropical depression until it dissipated over New York on August 20. Due to timely reports and warnings, the storm was reportedly forecast with \\"exceptional accuracy\\". In Florida, damage was minor, amounting to uprooted trees, broken windows, moderate crop damage, and downed power lines. A few flimsy structures and small watercraft also sustained damage. Along the Florida Panhandle, the storm's winds impacted power, telephone, and telegraph lines, and inflicted $2,000 worth of damage to a dock warehouse. A man in Cedar Key, Florida, drowned after rough surf overturned his rowboat, and at least two other people suffered minor storm-related injuries. Torrential rain fell in Alabama as a result of the storm's slow forward movement, leading to severe flooding. Further inland, the storm spawned a tornado in North Carolina which caused one death. As the depression continued heading inland, it dropped heavy precipitation throughout the Mid-Atlantic States, exceeding in Tuckerton, New Jersey, and in Manahawkin, New Jersey. ===Tropical Storm Three=== An operationally unnoticed tropical storm developed on August 15\\\\. At its peak, sustained winds were 65 mph (100 km/h) and the minimum pressure of . By August 19, the storm dissipated. ===Tropical Storm Four=== An area of disturbed weather over Central America organized into a tropical storm in the Bay of Campeche on September 23. Uneventfully, it moved generally north-northeastward through the Gulf of Mexico and its winds strengthened to a peak of . The storm made landfall on south-central Louisiana on September 26, and dissipated later that day. The Weather Bureau office in New Orleans posted numerous advisories, although the effects from the storm were minimal. ===Hurricane Five=== On the afternoon of October 9, reports from the Leeward Islands of low pressures and unsettled weather indicated that a storm was forming in the vicinity. The disturbance strengthened into a tropical storm on October 12 to the northeast of Puerto Rico. The quickly escalating storm tracked northwestward before turning towards the northeast, away from a high pressure area building in from the west. Early on October 15, the storm attained hurricane intensity and continued to mature until October 16, when it reached its peak at a strength corresponding to Category 4 status on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. That same day it passed just east of Bermuda. It weakened as it accelerated to the northeast, and became extratropical near Newfoundland a couple of days later. Numerous ships encountered the hurricane along its course. On the President Harding, en route to New York, one crew member drowned due to the rough conditions and 73 crew and passengers suffered injury, of various severity, requiring a call for emergency medical supplies. The ship itself sustained a bit of damage. As the storm passed near the island of Bermuda, it generated strong winds‚Äîgusting to ‚Äîand heavy precipitation. Damage was fairly significant; the winds uprooted trees, shattered windows, and disrupted public utilities. ===Hurricane Six=== On October 29, the fifth and final known tropical cyclone of the season developed in the western Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave. It initially moved northwestward, but turned toward the east shortly thereafter. Drifting due eastward, the storm grew into a minimal hurricane on October 31 while passing over the Cayman Islands. The hurricane's center passed just north of the island of Jamaica later that day as it weakened back into a tropical storm. Eventually, the storm turned abruptly northeastward and crossed the eastern tip of Cuba. By November 3, it had emerged into the Atlantic and entered the southern Bahamas. Beginning to accelerate, the tropical storm passed to the west of Bermuda before becoming extratropical on November 6. At Grand Cayman, winds from the storm reached with a minimum pressure of . According to press reports, the hurricane inflicted considerable damage on the Cayman Islands. In northern Jamaica, property damage was also widespread. The hurricane brought heavy rainfall, high winds, and pounding surf to the island, leaving one dead. Another death was reported in Cuba, where the torrential rains also caused extensive flooding and losses to livestock and crops. ==See also== * List of tropical cyclones * Atlantic hurricane season ==References== ==External links== * Monthly Weather Review Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines Category:1939 meteorology Category:1939 natural disasters ","title":"1939 Atlantic hurricane season"},{"id":"1428004","text":"Konstantin Yegorovich Makovsky (; ‚Äî) was an influential Russian painter, affiliated with the \\"Peredvizhniki (Wanderers)\\". Many of his historical paintings, such as Beneath the Crown (1889) also known as The Russian Bride's Attire and Before the Wedding, showed an idealized view of Russian life of prior centuries. He is often considered a representative of Academic art. ==Biography== Christmastide Divination. Historic paintings of Russian peasant life made Konstantin Makovsky popular in Russia Children of the Artist, 1882 Konstantin Makovsky was born in Moscow. His father was the Russian art figure and amateur painter, Yegor Ivanovich Makovsky. His mother was a composer, and she hoped her son would one day follow in her footsteps. His younger brothers Vladimir and Nikolay and his sister Alexandra also went on to become painters. In 1851 Makovsky entered the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture where he became the top student, easily getting all the available awards. His teachers were Karl Bryullov and Vasily Tropinin. Makovsky's inclinations to Romanticism and decorative effects can be explained by the influence of Bryullov. Although art was his passion, he also considered what his mother had wanted him to do. He set off to look for composers he could refer to, and first went to France. Before, he had always been a classical music lover, and listened to many pieces. He often wished he could change the tune, or style of some of them to make them more enjoyable. Later in his life it came true. In 1858 Makovsky entered the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg. From 1860 he participated in the Academy's exhibitions with paintings such as Curing of the Blind (1860) and Agents of the False Dmitry kill the son of Boris Godunov (1862). In 1863 Makovsky and thirteen other students held a protest against the Academy's setting of topics from Scandinavian mythology in the competition for the Large Gold Medal of Academia; all left the academy without a formal diploma. Makovsky's Ophelia Makovsky became a member of a co-operative (artel) of artists led by Ivan Kramskoi, typically producing Wanderers paintings on everyday life (Widow 1865, Herring-seller 1867, etc.). From 1870 he was a founding member of the Society for Traveling Art Exhibitions and continued to work on paintings devoted to everyday life. He exhibited his works at both the Academia exhibitions and the Traveling Art Exhibitions of the Wanderers. A significant change in his style occurred after traveling to Egypt and Serbia in the mid-1870s. His interests changed from social and psychological problems to the artistic problems of colors and shape. In the 1880s he became a fashionable author of portraits and historical paintings. At the World's Fair of 1889 in Paris he received the Large Gold Medal for his paintings Death of Ivan the Terrible, The Judgement of Paris, and Demon and Tamara. He was one of the most highly appreciated and highly paid Russian artists of the time. Many democratic critics considered him as a renegade of the Wanderers' ideals, producing (like Henryk Siemiradzki) striking but shallow works, while others see him as a forerunner of Russian Impressionism. Makovsky was killed in 1915 when his horse-drawn carriage was hit by an electric tram in Saint Petersburg. ==Selected works== File:A Boyar Wedding Feast (Konstantin Makovsky, 1883) Google Cultural Institute.jpgA Boyar Wedding Feast File:Konstantin Makovsky - The Bulgarian martyresses.jpgThe Bulgarian martyresses File:MakovskiyKE PocelObry.jpgKissing Ceremony File:The Russian Bride's Attire - Konstantin Makovsky.jpgBeneath the Crown/The Russian Bride's Attire/Before the Wedding File:Konstantin Makovsky - Escogiendo la novia.jpgBride-show File:Konstantin Makovsky, The Murder of False Dmitry.jpgThe Murder of False Dmitry File:Konstantin Makovsky - The Toilet of Venus, 1910.jpgThe Toilet of Venus File:Happy Arcadia by Konstantin Makovsky.jpgHappy Arcadia File:Konstantin Makovsky - The Judgment of Paris, 1889.jpgThe Judgement of Paris File:S.L.Stroganova by K.Makovsky (1864).jpgPortrait of S.

Its wide diet and ability to thrive in urban areas has made it a highly invasive species with established colonies in places such as Florida,http://ufwildlife.ifas.ufl.edu/frogs/cubantreefrog.shtml the Hawaiian island of Oahu, and the Caribbean Islands. These tree frogs can vary in size from 2 to 5.5 inches (5 to 12.7 cm) in length. Due to their large size, Cuban tree frogs can eat a wide variety of things, particularly native tree frogs, and their removal has shown to result in an increase in the amount of native tree frogs in an area. The tadpoles of Cuban tree frogs also heavily compete with native frog tadpoles, which can cause negative effects in body mass, size at metamorphosis, and growth rates for the native tadpoles. == Description == Cuban tree frogs are the largest tree frogs in North America, ranging from 2 to 5.5 inches or (5 to 12.7 cm) in length. Cuban tree frogs are mostly gray, brown, or green, with young frogs having more green coloration than adults. These frogs have rough, warty skin with blotchy or mottled patterning. Cuban tree frogs have the ability to change their color and pattern to camouflage themselves. The inner thighs of these frogs are bright yellow, which helps to confuse a predator when the frog jumps and reveals the color. The skin on their heads is fused to the skull; if the head of an adult frog is rubbed (between the eyes), the skin does not move. This special adaptation prevents water loss, since fewer blood vessels occur in the \\"co- ossified\\" (fused) area. Cuban tree frogs are able to secretes a toxic mucus from their skin which can cause a fiery sensation if it makes contact with a person's eyes. == Behavior == Cuban tree frogs are mainly nocturnal and sleep during the day, preferring to hunt and breed when the sun goes down. Being very voracious, this tree frog will eat almost anything large enough to fit in its mouth, including smaller frogs. Their foraging will occasionally take them up utility poles, where they can cause short-circuits of utility switches, causing costly power outages. Cuban tree frogs will sometimes sleep on palm trees or in potted plants, which can aid in their spread. == Life cycle == As with most frogs, female Cuban tree frogs are larger than males. During the breeding season, the male will have a black nuptial pad on his hand or wrist that helps him hold onto the female during amplexus. Cuban tree frogs breed year round depending on the conditions, preferring to breed during the wetter months. Optimal conditions are considered to be with high humidity (97.8%) and rain. A female can lay several hundred eggs to over a thousand in a single clutch. Eggs can hatch in under 30 hours and tadpoles can fully develop in one month. They have wide caudal fins and two rows of labial teeth on the top of their mouths and four rows on the bottom. Tadpoles survive on algae and will occasionally eat other tadpoles, and on rare occasions, recently metamorphosed juveniles. After metamorphosis, froglets are between long. == Distribution == South West Florida The Cuban tree frog is native to Cuba, the Bahamas, and the Cayman Islands. This large frog has been introduced in Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and the British Virgin Islands. Whether the species was native to the Key West region of Florida is debated, or if it was introduced to the area. First discovered in the 1930s, these frogs arrived via cargo ships in the 1800s. They can survive in brackish water, which may have helped the species to spread to various islands. The Cuban tree frogs' progressive colonization into the mainland of Florida is believed to be abetted by use of State Road A1A construction during the 1940s. The species is now established in southern Florida and parts of the panhandle region, and can be found as far north as South Carolina. The Cuban tree frog is known to hitchhike on shipments of potted plants, vegetation, packaging, boats, and other motorized vehicles. Once in a new location, the frogs become an invasive species. In Puerto Rico, they have become a predator of the endemic coqu√≠ frog.Rana depredadora del coqu√≠ campea por su respeto en Puerto Rico(in Spanish) They have several good colonizing traits, such as high fecundity, short generation time, a diverse diet, good competitive ability, and the ability to coexist with humans. In addition, they also secrete a toxic mucus from their skin which helps to limit the number of natural predators. Cuban tree frogs are known to inhabit a variety of habitats, including estuaries, low-density suburban development, small towns, agricultural areas, particularly ones with exotic plants, and lowland forests and swamps. Within their habitats, they can be found in damp, shady areas, particularly around shrubs and trees, by cisterns, rain barrels, and buildings. They like to be near medium and large sized trees and prefer conditions where the temperature lies above 10 degrees celsius. ==Conservation== This large frog directly impacts native ecosystems by eating native frogs, lizards, and snakes, and poses a threat to the biodiversity of the areas into which it spreads by causing native tree frog populations to decline. These effects are most noticeable in urban and suburban areas, where native tree frogs, such as the American green tree frog (Hyla cinerea) and the squirrel treefrog (Hyla squirella) are rapidly disappearing. It has spread throughout peninsular Florida, and is also commonly found in isolated populations as far north as southern Georgia. It is inadvertently carried on vehicles or ornamental plants, spreading to new areas, and has been transported as far north and west as Saskatchewan, Canada. Because of its effects on the biodiversity, some experts have recommended killing the animal when it is found in a new habitat. This can be done, most humanely, through the application of Orajel to the abdominal skin, waiting fifteen minutes for the frog to be fully anaesthetized, and then placing it in a freezer for a few hours. ==In captivity== Cuban tree frogs are commonly available in the pet trade within the United States. They are inexpensive, and when cared for properly tend to live five to ten years. They feed readily on any animal they can fit in their mouths, which can result in cannibalistic behavior if frogs housed together have a significant size difference. Their toxic mucus can burn the eyes and trigger an allergic (or asthmatic) reaction; as a result, this species is not an ideal pet species, especially for children. The Cuban tree frog's colonization of Oahu is believed to be a result of accidental or deliberate release of pets. Therefore, the species is now banned from sale in Hawaii. Conviction of importation of a Cuban tree frog carries a maximum fine of $25,000 and a year in jail. ==References== ==Further reading== *Behler JL, King FW. 1979.

Smith, \\"Samuel H. Smith: Faithful Brother of Joseph and Hyrum\\", Ensign, August 2008, pp. 44‚Äì51. Smith was baptized by Oliver Cowdery, who had become the first baptized Latter Day Saint on May 15, 1829 (Joseph Smith had been baptized immediately after Cowdery). At the end of June 1829, Samuel, along with his brother Hyrum, his father, and several men of the Peter Whitmer Sr. family, signed a joint statement declaring their testimony of the golden plates that Joseph Smith said he translated into the Book of Mormon. The witnesses stated that \\"we did handle [the golden plates] with our hands; and we also saw the engravings thereon\\". This \\"Testimony of the Eight Witnesses\\" was printed as the final page of the Book of Mormon and is still included in the preface of most current editions. Smith became one of the first six members of the Church of Christ when it was formally organized on April 6, 1830.Joseph Smith (B. H. Roberts (ed.), History of the Church 1:76, footnote. ==Latter Day Saint missionary== At the next church conference, Smith was ordained one of the church's earliest elders. Smith was a successful missionary and served a number of missions. His first mission involved going to Mendon, New York, where he gave John P. Greene a copy of the Book of Mormon, which not only led to Greene joining the church, but also Greene's brother-in-law, Brigham Young. In December 1830, Smith went on a mission to Kirtland, Ohio, to follow up on the success Cowdery and Parley P. Pratt had teaching there.Andrew Jenson. Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia. Vol. 1, pp. 278‚Äì82. Smith later went on a mission with Reynolds Cahoon in which they traveled to Missouri in 1831. During this mission they taught and baptized William E. McLellin. This mission also involved some of the first Latter Day Saint missionary work in Indiana, involving preaching at Unionville, Madison and Vienna.2006 Deseret News Church Almanac (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret News, 2005) p. 208. In June 1832, Smith and Orson Hyde were the first Latter Day Saint missionaries to preach in Connecticut.2006 Deseret News Church Almanac (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret News, 2005) p. 190. During the same month, Smith and Hyde went to Boston. As a result of their efforts, branches were established in both Boston and New Rowley, Massachusetts.2006 Deseret News Church Almanac (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret News, 2005) p. 218. In July 1832, Smith and Hyde went to Providence, Rhode Island; they baptized two people, but in response to threats of violence left the state after being there only twelve days.2006 Deseret News Church Almanac (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret News, 2005) p. 249. In September 1832, Smith and Hyde were the first Latter Day Saint missionaries to preach in Maine.2006 Deseret News Church Almanac (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret News, 2005) p. 215. On this 1832 mission, Smith and Hyde also baptized people in Spafford, New York. ==High council and other church service== When the first high council of the church--at the time the chief judicial and legislative body of the church--was organized on February 17, 1834, Smith was one of twelve men chosen as a member. Later that year, Smith married Mary Bailey, his first wife, with whom he had four children. In 1835, Smith was made a general agent for the firm in charge of publishing a Latter Day Saint hymnal and school books for children, thus working closely with Emma Smith and W. W. Phelps. Smith moved with his family to Far West, Missouri, in 1838 and took part in the subsequent Mormon War that took place in northwestern Missouri that year. At the Battle of Crooked River, Smith fought next to apostle David W. Patten, who subsequently died from wounds received in the skirmish. As a result of the conflict, the Latter Day Saints were expelled from Missouri and Smith moved with the main body to their new headquarters in Nauvoo, Illinois. Due to his role in the Battle of Crooked River, Smith fled Missouri almost immediately, along with Lorenzo D. Young, Benjamin L. Clapp and Charles C. Rich. In 1839 Smith settled in the general vicinity of Macomb, Illinois. Smith's wife, Mary, died in Nauvoo in 1841 and he married Lavira Clark later that year. Smith and Lavira had three children together. ==Death== Smith's brothers, Joseph and Hyrum, were killed by a mob on June 27, 1844, while being held in Carthage Jail, in Illinois. Samuel was attacked by mobbers, while traveling toward Carthage after hearing rumors of trouble, and is said to have developed some kind of stitch in his side evading them, which may have contributed to his subsequent deathThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. After evading the mobbers, he traveled to the jail (said to have been the first Latter-day Saint after the mobbers left), and retrieved his brothers' bodies. Some church members assumed that Samuel would succeed Joseph as the president of the Latter Day Saint church (see lineal succession (Latter Day Saints)). However, Samuel fell ill shortly after their deaths and died just one month later. Smith's official cause of death was \\"bilious fever\\", which is an archaic and inexact term for any disease accompanied by a fever and the evacuation of bile, such as typhoid fever or malaria. Lucy Mack Smith later suggested Smith had become ill because of the fatigue and shock occasioning by his experience of the death of his brothers.Anderson, Lavina Fielding (2001), Lucy's Book: A Critical Edition of Lucy Mack Smith's Family Memoir, Salt Lake CIty: Signature Books., p. 750 & n.122. Soon after his death, rumors circulated that Smith was poisoned by Hosea Stout on orders from Willard Richards.Anderson, p. 750 n. 122.Jon Krakauer (2003). Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith (New York: Doubleday) p. 194.D. Michael Quinn (1994). The Mormon Hierarchy: Origins of Power (Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books) pp. 152‚Äì153.William Smith, \\"Mormonism: A Letter from William Smith, Brother of Joseph the Prophet\\", New York Tribune, 1857-05-19. In a meeting on July 10, 1844, Smith had been in a meeting with Richards in which Smith reminded the group that he was Joseph's designee as president if both Joseph and Hyrum had died. Richards, however, had wanted to delay the decision on succession until Brigham Young and other prominent missionaries had returned to Nauvoo. Stout was suspected in part because, as reported by Smith's wife, Stout had been administering a white powder to Smith daily as treatment for his illness. Smith's mother does not appear to have considered him to have been murdered, and though his sole remaining brother, William Smith, later charged Richards and Stout with foul play, he did not bring forward his own evidence in support of that accusation until 1892. William Smith's charges were not pursued by legal authorities. ==See also== * Latter Day Saint martyrs ==Notes== ==References== *LaRene Porter Gaunt and Robert A. Smith, \\"Samuel H.

(630-668 AD).Obv Lion left Rev Name of Narasimhavarman with solar and lunar symbols around Narasimhavarman I or Narasimha Varma I was a king of the Pallava dynasty who ruled South India from 630‚Äì668 AD. He shared his father Mahendravarman I's love of art and completed the work started by Mahendravarman in Mamallapuram. During his reign famous Pancha Rathas Temple was constructed which is Rock Cut Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage site. He avenged his father's defeat at the hands of the Chalukya king, Pulakeshin II in the year 642 AD . Narasimhavarman I was also known as Mahamalla (great wrestler), and Mamallapuram (Mahabalipuram) was named after him. It was during his reign, in 640 AD, that the Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang visited Kanchipuram. Narasimhavarman I was a devotee of Shiva. The great Nayanar saints like Appar, Siruthondar and Tirugnanasambandar lived during his reign. Narasimhavarman I was succeeded by his son Mahendravarman II in the year 668 AD. ==Military conquests== Narasimhavarman I is claimed to be one of the 12 Indian kings who never lost on the battlefield to their enemies, the others being Ajatashatru, Chandragupta Maurya, Karikala Chola, Cheran Senguttuvan, Sri krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagar empire, Chola king Rajasuyam Vaetta Perunarkilli (575 BC), who successfully completed military Rajasuyam sacrifice, Pandyan Nedunchezhian of the Sangam age, Samudragupta, great Pallava Nayanmar saint Rajasimha, Rajaraja Chola I, his great warrior son Rajendra Chola . ===War with the Chalukyas=== Pulakeshin II, a deccan king, had previously raided various northern Pallava provinces and forts. However, he was unable to capture the Pallava capital of Kanchipuram.Keay, John, India: A History, p170 This led to a long conflict between the Chalukyas and the Pallavas. Pulakeshin II again attempted to seize the Pallava capital and undertook another expedition several years later. However, the Pallava reign had moved on to Narasimhavarman I by then. Narasimhavarman defeated the Chalukyas in several battles, including one at Manimangalam 20 miles to the east of Kanchipuram. The king states that he could see the back of his dreaded enemy as he tore apart his army. Encouraged by this victory, Narasimhavarman led his army along with his general Paranjothi and invaded Vatapi, successfully defeating and killing the Chalukya king Pulakeshin II in 642 CE. The city was never a capital again.KAN Sastri, A History of South India, p136 He returned victorious to Kanchipuram, and was given the title Vatapikondan (one who conquered Vatapi).Keay, John, India: A History, p172 His general Paranjothi (a Vikrama Kesari, also known as paradurgamarddana) was known very well for his devotion to Lord Siva and as one of the 63 Nayanmar saints, is said to have indeed personally destroyed the city of Vatapi under the command of Narasimhavarman I. Sekkizhaar's work 12th tirumurai credits this siruttondar of having destroyed the evil kali as manifested by the deccan enemy of pallavas. He is also known as 'Siruthonttar', a dutiful warrior and a practicing medic who had \\"mastered several treatises in medicine\\". This vikramakesari had at the insistence of Lord Sivan sacrificed his child without any qualms. There was a confusion as to whether the Ganesha at a temple in Chengattankudy could have been a result of this invasion. Many grants refer to this event as: \\"kilisayoneriva vimattita vathapi\\" or the one who destroyed Vatapi, the same way Sage Agastya had killed a demon by that name long ago.(**) ===Influence on Sri Lankan politics=== The Sinhalese prince Manavarma lived at the court of Narasimhavarman and had helped him crush his enemy Pulakeshin II. In return, Narasimhavarman had helped Manavarma twice with an army to invade Sri Lanka. The second attack was successful. Manavarma occupied Sri Lanka, over which he is supposed to have ruled from A. D. 691 to 726. The Kasakudi copper plates refer to Narasimhavarman's conquest of Sri Lanka. The Mahavamsa also confirms these facts. ==Narasimhavarman in literature== Kalki Krishnamurthy's work, Sivagamiyin Sabadham, is based on Narasimhavarman's early years and his battles with the Chalukyas. Kalki Krishnamurthy's Parthiban kanavu is based on the later years of Narasimhavarman's rule. ==Notes== ==References== * * (**) Ancient India, R. C.

Diminea≈£a said of this play that it \\"does not have a subject in the conventional sense of the word\\" but is instead \\"the dream of a cold night\\", moving smoothly between the world of the living and that of the dead.

Tudor Arghezi, who did not speak Yiddish, praised Sternberg highly for the production, and for the structure of the performance, whose blend of \\"order and disorder\\" he described as \\"inexplicable, like Beethoven's music\\". Arghezi also remarked of A Night in the Old Town, \\"you are either open to this, or you are not\\". Many were not. Barbu LƒÉzƒÉreanu, a prominent Jewish intellectual and ethnologist, said that BITS \\"altered the Peretz's work into an orgy of orori osifere [roughly, 'graveyard horrors'] and monosyllabism that creates an unstoppable impression of the lugubrious and hyper-transcendental.\\" Their subsequent production of Sholom Aleichem's Der Farkishefter Shnayder (The Bewitched Tailor) was described by the Literarishe Bleter of Warsaw, Poland as \\"a unified and enchanting spectacle of prose, poetry, and song\\" incorporating new songs \\"full of hope\\", but also music from the synagogue and popular song, \\"but on all this it embroiders a sad mirth, realist-simple and demented-symbolist comedy, which ends with optimistic rhymes -- the moral of the comedy -- sung by the comedians themselves.\\" ==References== * Bercovici, Israil, O sutƒÉ de ani de teatru evreiesc √Æn Rom√¢nia (\\"One hundred years of Yiddish/Jewish theater in Romania\\"), 2nd Romanian-language edition, revised and augmented by Constantin MƒÉciucƒÉ.

In wrestling a pin is achieved by holding an opponent's shoulders to the mat for a three count. Pinfall is the term used in professional wrestling which is a way to win the match for that person or team. ==Background== A pinfall is a victory condition in various forms of professional wrestling that is met by holding (pinning) an opponent's shoulders on the wrestling mat, usually until the referee counts to three. In professional wrestling, a pinfall is a common method of winning a match. The count is broken (a near- fall) if the opponent manages to raise one or both of their shoulders off the mat, commonly by kicking out (throwing their legs up to cause their shoulders to rise from the mat). In some positions, a wrestler may bridge (arching their back so that only their feet and the top of their head are touching the ground) to put more of their weight on the pinned opponent or to prop themselves up from being pinned. Sometimes, an attacking wrestler may (illegally, within the context of the fictional match---the move is scripted with the participants' consent throughout) hook the opponent's tights for extra leverage. Another popular illegal tactic of heel wrestlers is to attempt a pin close to the ring ropes so they can prop their legs (or on rare occasions, arms) up on the ropes to gain additional leverage, putting more weight on the opponent. On the other hand, a pinfall attempt cannot occur in the first place when one rolls out of the ring if falls do not count anywhere, or if the opponent lies on their stomach upon impact, so it would take extra effort to roll the opponent over, even when they are knocked out cold, due to the body being effectively a dead weight. ==Pinning techniques== === Backslide=== A backslide pin The Undertaker pinning Bray Wyatt with his signature variation pinfall crossing the opponent's arms across their chest after his finishing move, the Tombstone Piledriver, also called the \\"Rest In Peace\\" pin. The attacking wrestler stands back-to-back with their opponent and hooks both of the opponent's arms. They then lean forward and drop to their knees, sliding the opponent down their back so that their shoulders are against the mat and their chin is against their chest. The attacker holds the opponent's arms down with their own arms for the pin. ===Cover=== Also known as a lateral press, cross press, or simply as the basic pin. With an opponent lying face-up on the mat, the attacking wrestler lies face-down across the opponent's chest to hold them down. Sometimes, when both wrestlers are exhausted or badly hurt the attacking wrestler will cover with just an arm or lie down face up rather than face down. The term floatover (when in reference to a pin) refers to an attacking wrestler using the momentum of a throw or slam they are performing to propel themselves over the opponent into the lateral press position. A variation commonly used by The Undertaker sees the wrestler cross the opponent's arms across their chest, similar to a corpse. This is sometimes called a \\"Rest In Peace\\" pin, though there is no official name. ===Cradle=== The attacking wrestler lies across the opponent's chest and hooks a leg with the arm on the opposite side (left leg with right arm or right leg with left arm). Holding the leg gives the attacker greater leverage and thus makes it harder for the opponent to kick out. This was derived from the inside cradle and outside cradle in amateur wrestling. ===Crucifix=== An attacking wrestler hooks the arms of an opponent by grapevining their legs around one arm and their arms around the other. This positions the attacking wrestler horizontally across the back of the opponent and forces the opponent's arms out like a crucifixion. The attacking wrestler then lowers their bodyweight so that the opponent is brought down to the mat backwards and is forced onto their own shoulders in a pinning position, with their legs in the air. A variation on the standard crucifix, the crucifix bomb or crucifix driver, sees an attacking wrestler violently force their bodyweight downwards to throw the opponent into the mat with greater impact. ===Delfin Clutch=== The Delfin Clutch has an attacking wrestler crossing the arms of the opponent across their own chest while they're lying on their back on the mat. The attacking wrestler then kneels down on one knee on the opponent's arms, pinning the opponent's shoulders down to the mat. The attacking wrestler then grabs the opponent's legs, crosses them, and places them under one of their armpits, bending the opponent to a pinning predicament. Innovated by Super Delfin. ===Gannosuke Clutch=== The Gannosuke Clutch has an attacking wrestler facing the opponent, grabbing their arm, twisting it into a modified hammerlock and then performing a front somersault while holding the trapped arm in place as well as legsweeping the opponent's near leg, rolling the opponent backwards while the attacking wrestler keeps the hammerlock applied while also holding the opponent's near leg down with their own leg. This move is also known as an arm trap somersault cradle. This was innovated and popularized by Mr. Gannosuke, who named it after himself. ===Gedo Clutch=== The Gedo Clutch has an attacking wrestler sit kneeling on the back of an opponent who is lying face down and facing the same way. The attacking wrestler then grabs the opponent's arms and lifts them over their thighs, similar to a camel clutch. The attacker then grabs hold of the opponent's head and pushes it down and forward between their legs, while the wrestler leans forward onto their stomach, flipping the opponent over onto their shoulders, with the attacker's legs pinning the opponent down to the mat. This hold is technically known as a double leg nelson. It was innovated by Gedo and used by Taichi as Taichi-shiki Gedo Clutch, Taichi-Style Gedo Clutch or Taichi Clutch. ===Jackknife hold=== The hold has the opponent wrestler lying on their back. Standing at the feet of the opponent, the attacking wrestler then lifts the opponent's legs from behind the knees. Still gripping the opponent's legs, the attacking wrestler then flips forward, over the opponent, and plants their feet on the mat while bridging the back to add leverage. A variation of the jackknife hold, known as the figure four pin, has the attacker placing the opponent's legs in a figure four position before executing the bridge. European Clutch The hold is an Inverted Jacknife Pin that is used with a double pumphandle arm wringer. It is a pinning variation that is usually used after a iconoclasm. Zack Sabre uses it as his Finisher. ===La magistral=== Also referred to as la casita or as bandito, this move's technical name is arm-wrench inside cradle pin, and it is performed with the opponent on their hands and knees. From this position, the attacking wrestler stands next to the opponent's hip, grabs one arm, and applies an armbar. The attacking wrestler then steps over the arm with their inside leg so that they facing away from the opponent. The attacking wrestler continues the turning motion and dives forward over the opponent, rolling onto their side. The barred arm acts as a lever, flipping the opponent over the attacker and onto their back. The attacker hooks one or both legs as the opponent goes over and holds for the pin. ===Mousetrap=== A modified version of La Magistral, the attacking wrestler wrenches the opponent's arm to get behind the opponent. While holding the arm, the attacker steps through the opponent's inside leg and puts the wrenched arm between the attacker's and opponent's legs. The attacker falls forward, making the opponent flip onto their back and neck in a crucifix. This leaves the opponent's inside leg and both arm hooked in the pin. This pin has been popularized by Orange Cassidy as his finishing hold. ===Oklahoma roll=== Not to be confused with the O'Connor roll, which is a roll-up. The attacking wrestler stands to the side of the opponent, who is on their hands and knees. The attacker hooks one arm around the opponent's neck and one between the legs, and rolls over the opponent. The attacker lands on their back or side, and the opponent is flipped so that their shoulders are pressed against the mat. ===Prawn hold=== Similar to a rana, except that the attacking wrestler is standing, bent over the opponent with both legs hooked, pressing their weight down, it also exist of a variation with the attack wrestler bridging while the count is on. This pin is typically the result of a powerbomb. ===Rana=== Implementation of a rana pin. Also known as the double leg cradle (from the original Spanish rana, meaning Frog), is the technical term for the pinning position which results from a sunset flip or a hurricanrana. In the sunset flip version, the opponent is lying shoulders down on the mat, almost completely flat on their back, while the wrestler applying the pin sits below the legs of the opponent and uses their own legs to cover the opponent's shoulders or arms, then hooks both legs around the opponent's thighs to force their weight down to the mat. The other variation, which usually results from a hurricanrana, sees the one performing the hurricanrana sit on the opponent's chest and hook the opponent's legs behind them while hooking the opponent's arms with their legs. This variation is the same hold, just with the attacking wrestler on top. This interchangeability often sees a spot where the wrestlers change their weight distribution to move from one pinning hold to the other for a succession of near falls. It is the pin after the West Coast Pop, used by Rey Mysterio. ===Roll-up=== Not to be confused with a schoolboy pin or a backslide pin. The attacking wrestler holds their opponent from behind in a waistlock. The attacking wrestler then performs a backward roll while holding the waistlock. The opponent ends up on their shoulders with the attacking wrestler sitting on top of their legs holding the opponent down. This move is often done when the opponent is leaning on the ropes facing out of the ring and the attacking wrestler would first push forward into the ropes with the waistlock in order to generate faster backward motion. A common heel tactic is to grab the back of the opponents clothing or tights while sitting on top of them or to use the ropes for leverage, thus making the pin illegal. It is sometimes called the O'Connor roll, after Pat O'Connor's usage of the move; but O'Connor himself dubbed the move a \\"reverse rolling cradle\\". Bob Backlund also performed this move and additionally bridged over the opponent at the end of the move. ===Schoolboy=== Not to be confused with a roll-up. The schoolboy sweep sees the attacking wrestler drop down behind the opponent and put one arm up between the opponent's legs to pull the opponent over the attacking wrestler so that they fall flat on their back. At this point, the attacking wrestler would stack the fallen opponent on their shoulders for the pin. Often when female wrestlers use this move, commentators will refer to it as a schoolgirl. An inverted version like the regular version instead lays sideways on the butt/thigh area in a form of a bridge. ===Sitout pin=== The attacking wrestler sits down with the legs of the opponent hooked over their shoulders so that the legs and lower body of the opponent are elevated while their shoulders and upper back are in contact with the mat. The arms of the opponent are sometimes pinned beneath the legs of the attacker. This hold results from numerous throws, including the sitout powerbomb, the spin-out powerbomb, and the sunset flip. Japanese wrestler, Manami Toyota, popularized a modified pin that usually ended on a sitout position; She called it the Manami Roll. ===Small package=== The small package‚Äîor inside cradle‚Äîis a pinning maneuver where the attacking wrestler puts the opponent into a front face lock and pulls the opponent's near arm over their head, like a suplex. Then, the attacking wrestler hooks their opponent's far leg with the opposite leg and the opponent's other leg with their hand. The attacker will then fall back, pinning the opponent. Used by Toru Yano as finishing move. A variation preceded by an arm wrench, before delivering the small package is used by Hirooki Goto as Goto Ni Shiki. ===Split leg=== In this pinning maneuver, the attacking wrestler has the opponent on their back and grabs both the opponent's legs, puts them above the opponent's head, jumps up in the air, opens their legs, and falls on the opponent's legs, trapping them into a pinning situation. ===Straddle=== In this pinning technique, the attacking wrestler stands with their feet on either side of an opponent who is lying face-up on the mat. Then the attacker kneels across the opponent's chest facing their head, with each knee beside the chest. Sometimes the attacker sits on the opponent's chest for greater pressure. There is also a reverse variation in which the attacker is facing the opponent's feet. The shoulder straddle pin is typical variation of the straddle pin. It sees the attacker kneeling on the opponent's shoulders facing the head, pinning them on the mat. In another variation, the attacker sits on the neck or face of the opponent with or without the knee on the shoulder. Primarily called a facesit, it is used mostly by heels or in mixed professional wrestling to demonstrate dominance and entertain the crowd. ===Sunset flip=== This pin commonly sees an attacking wrestler dive over an opponent who is facing them, usually bent over forwards, catching the opponent in a waistlock from behind and landing back- first behind the opponent. From that position the wrestler rolls forward into a sitting position, pulling the opponent over backwards and down to the mat so that they land on their back into a sitout pin position. While being held on the shoulders of an attacking wrestler in a position where this second wrestler is straddling the head of the attacking wrestler while facing in the other direction. One variation is the split-legged (used by some known wrestlers like Alicia Fox and the retired Christy Hemme), in which a cornered wrestler, as a counter to an oncoming opponent, jumps and splits their legs, sits on the top turnbuckle in a straddle position, then rolls forward to catch the opponent in a waistlock to roll into a usual sunset flip. ===Victory roll=== The attacking wrestler jumps onto the opponent's shoulders from behind and rolls forward. As the attacker flips over, they hook the opponent's shoulders with their legs, flipping the opponent over onto their shoulders. The attacker hooks both of the opponent's legs to hold them in place for the pin. ===Wheelbarrow victory roll=== A slight variation of the victory roll, which sees the wrestler being wheelbarrowed by the opponent. The wrestler then \\"counters\\" the wheelbarrow by the opponent, flipping forward into a pin, with both of the opponent's legs hooked to complete the pin. The slight difference between the two variations is that the wrestler in the normal victory roll is over the opponent's shoulders, while in the wheelbarrow variation the wrestler is scissoring the opponent's body under the shoulders. The latter is more effective. ==See also== *Near-fall *Pin (amateur wrestling) ==Footnotes== ==References== * The Professional Wrestlers' Workout & Instructional Guide - Harley Race, Ricky Steamboat, Les Thatcher, and Alex Marvez pg. 76 Category:Professional wrestling slang Category:Professional wrestling moves ja:„Éï„Ç©„Éº„É´ÊäÄ ","title":"Pin (professional wrestling)"},{"id":"1428047","text":"Pinedjem I was the High Priest of Amun at Thebes in Ancient Egypt from 1070 to 1032 BC and the de facto ruler of the south of the country from 1054 BC.

Herihor instead intervened to assume this office. After Herihor's death, Pinedjem I finally claimed this office which had once been held by his father Piankh. This interpretation is supported by the decorations from the Temple of Khonsu at Karnak where Herihor's wall reliefs here are immediately followed by those of Pinedjem I with no intervening phase for Piankh and also by the long career of Pinedjem I who served as High Priest of Amun and later as king at Thebes. pectoral of the High Priest Pinedjem I. He inherited a political and religious base of power at Thebes. Pinedjem strengthened his control over both Middle and Upper Egypt and asserted his kingdom's virtual independence from the Twenty-first Dynasty based at Tanis. He married Duathathor-Henuttawy, a daughter of Ramesses XI, to cement his relations with the other powerful families of the period. Their son, Psusennes I, went on to become Pharaoh at Tanis, thereby removing at a stroke the gap between the two families. In practice, however, the 21st dynasty kings and the Theban high priests were probably never very far apart politically since they respected each other's political autonomy. Around Year 15 or 16 of Smendes, Pinedjem I proclaimed himself pharaoh over Upper EgyptTaylor, p.1148 and his priestly role was inherited by his two sons Masaharta and Menkheperre. His daughter, Maatkare, held the position of Divine Adoratrice of Amun. Pinedjem's mummy was found in the cache at Deir el-Bahri. ==Family== Ushabti of Pinedjem I, from Deir el-Bahari, now in Brooklyn Museum.

Duathathor-Henuttawy, the daughter of Ramesses XI bore him several children: the future pharaoh Psusennes I, the God's Wife of Amun Maatkare, Princess Henuttawy and probably Queen Mutnedjmet, the wife of Psusennes.Dodson & Hilton, p.200 Another wife was Isetemkheb, Singer of Amun.

The faculty includes a Nobel laureate and three National Academy of Sciences members. In 2006, the faculty collected a combined $38.5 million in peer-reviewed federal funding, and annually generates over $5 million in indirect cost return for Texas A&M.; The Chemistry Department ranks 15th nationally in the National Research Council rankings, the highest ranking of any Texas A&M; department, and ranks as the seventh-largest chemistry department in research and development expenditures among all American universities. The Department of Mathematics ranks 13th nationally among other public university Mathematics departments in research funding, and is one of only five nationwide that has both Vertical Integration of Research and Education in the Mathematical Sciences (VIGRE) and Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) National Science Foundation grants. The Mathematics Departments also offers one of the nation's only fully online master's degrees in mathematics. The Physics Department is one of eight partners in the $500 million Giant Magellan Telescope. ==History== When Texas A&M; was founded as a land-grant agricultural college in 1876, the school consisted of only two faculty, one of whom taught agricultural chemistry and scientific agriculture. The Texas State Legislature had mandated that science and mathematics existed only to supply instruction to applied fields, and pure scientific study or research was not encouraged. It was not until 1924 that the college established a School of Arts and Sciences, which taught liberal arts, business administration, preparation for teaching, and science. Courses in chemistry and physics were offered in the School of Engineering. Following World War II and the advent of the atomic bomb, more students clamored for training in pure and natural sciences versus applied science. In 1944 the college had established the Texas A&M; Research Foundation, further encourage scientifically minded young people to attend A&M.; Between 1948 and 1958 the proportion of students in the School of Arts and Sciences grew much more rapidly than those in the Schools of Agriculture and Engineering, and by 1957 comprised 25% of the student body. Texas A&M; was elevated to university status in 1963, and three years later the College of Science was born, offering the departments of biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. The Cyclotron Institute, which conducts research in the nuclear aspects of chemistry, physics, biology, and engineering was placed under the administration of the College of Science in 1971, and in 1984 the Institute of Statistics was renamed to the Department of Statistics. In 2009, the Department of Physics became the Department of Physics and Astronomy to reflect the membership in the Giant Magellan Telescope Project in 2004, and the inclusion of an Astronomy Program in 2006.

Situated along the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, the state line crosses the gap, as does Newfound Gap Road (which overlaps U.S. Route 441 through the park and ends at the park's boundaries near Gatlinburg, Tennessee and Cherokee, North Carolina). The Appalachian Trail also traverses the gap, as do a small number of other hiking trails. Newfound Gap is also home to the Rockefeller Memorial, a popular destination within the national park and the site from where former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt formally dedicated the park on September 2, 1940.http://www.nps.gov/grsm/gsmsite/welcome.html According to the National Weather Service, Newfound Gap has around 19 snowy days per year. From 1991 to 2005, annual snowfall ranged from to .http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mrx/skywarn/awareness/wwaw2008.pdf ==History== Prior to the development of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Newfound Gap was an undiscovered pass two miles east of what was long thought to be the lowest mountain pass over the Great Smoky Mountains, Indian Gap. Indian Gap Road, an unpaved, arduous trail frequented by traders, farmers, and even by the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, was completed in 1839 and named after the old Cherokee Indian trail that the road paralleled. Newfound Gap itself was not recognized as the lowest gap over the mountains until 1872, when Arnold Guyot measured many of the mountains in the area and determined the \\"Newfound Gap\\" to be a lower, more accessible mountain pass. ==Newfound Gap Road== With the development of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park came the construction of a newer, more modern highway from Tennessee to North Carolina, completed in 1932 - this time crossing Newfound Gap, replacing the now-defunct Indian Gap Road. North of the park, it is now known as Great Smoky Mountains Parkway. The Gatlinburg Bypass, originally intended to be a part of the Foothills Parkway, extends out from the park to connect Newfound Gap Road south of town to the parkway north of town. Despite its heavy winter snows, the pass is kept open all year, except during and just after winter storms. When closed, the snow route is a long detour around the east-northeast end of the park, using U.S. 321 and Interstate 40. The Tennessee side typically has heavier snow because of its north and northwestern exposure. Even when valley roads are clear and there is little snow in Gatlinburg (and almost none in Cherokee), Newfound Gap may have far deeper snow, and will be closed for several hours after significant snowfall ends. Additionally, being in a national park, Newfound Gap Road is only treated by snowplows and a gravel- sand mix, as no chemicals can be used for snow removal due to their harm to the environment. The road was closed for days after the Great Blizzard of 1993, when of snow fell, and snowdrifts piled up to twice that. ==ReferencesGreat Smoky Mountains National Park Category:Great Smoky Mountains National Park Category:Mountain passes of North Carolina Category:Mountain passes of Tennessee Category:Landforms of Sevier County, Tennessee Category:Landforms of Swain County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Sevier County, Tennessee Category:Transportation in Swain County, North Carolina Category:U.S. Route 441 ","title":"Newfound Gap"},{"id":"1428084","text":"Norfolk County, Virginia (from 1895 map), existed from 1691-1963, now extinct Bower's Hill is a community located in the independent city of Chesapeake, Virginia (formerly Norfolk County) in the United States. It is located in the South Hampton Roads region at the northeastern edge of the Great Dismal Swamp, an area consisting of generally low-lying sandy terrain of the coastal plain. Popular legend has that it was named for an early highway overpass on the Military Highway which was built around 1943. However, maps dating from the early 19th century show a place named \\"Bower's Hill\\". Other information in archives at the Library of Virginia also dates the name to a time long prior to the construction of the Military Highway. In any event, the area now justifies its name with an elaborate interchange of overpasses at the juncture of three Interstate highways and three arterial (U.S.) highways. Bower's Hill is also the possible location of a future high-speed rail passenger station. ==History== Bower's Hill, which was in now-extinct Norfolk County near the northeastern edge of the Great Dismal Swamp, became a crossroads as highways and railroads were built through the area in the 20th century. The natural terrain of the coastal plain of the Tidewater area is very flat and sandy. The combination of U.S. Highway 13, U.S. Highway 58, and U.S. Highway 460, known as the Military Highway, was a 4-lane undivided highway that was built about 1943. A large s-shaped highway overpass was constructed to carry the traffic across the Seaboard Air Line Railroad tracks to eliminate an at-grade crossing and to allow an interchange with Airline Boulevard. The highway there originally was 4-lane undivided with a 45-mph S-curve as the highway passed on a bridge over the railroad, and with short approach fills with considerable grades to the bridge. Although the name Bower's Hill was attached to the area as early as the 19th century, as one of the highest features for miles around, the newly created overpass at Bower's Hill became something of a landmark for travelers in the 1950s and 1960s before creation of the U.S. Interstate Highway System beginning in 1956. Many people concluded (incorrectly) that the new overpasses were the source of the name. Others speculated that the hill was named after Chey \\"Lost an Argument\\" Bowers. In 1963, the voters of Norfolk County and the independent city of South Norfolk chose to consolidate into a new city, and Chesapeake was formed. Still-rural Bower's Hill became a borough of the new city. It is bordered to the north by another borough, Western Branch. ==Hampton Roads Beltway== In January 1997, the 56-mile-long I-64/I-664 loop was designated by the Virginia Department of Transportation (and signed) as the Hampton Roads Beltway. The beltway has the clockwise direction (as looking down at a map of the area) signed as the Inner Loop, and the counter- clockwise direction signed as the Outer Loop. ==South Hampton Roads High Speed Rail== The Virginia General Assembly commissioned several studies of the possibility of establishing high-speed passenger rail service between Richmond and South Hampton Roads. The under-utilized former Virginian Railway main line through the area (now owned by Norfolk Southern, was identified as a feasible corridor. The Bower's Hill area was named as the preferred location for the site of a suburban passenger rail station, with the only other station to be in downtown Norfolk. While those plans are only in a study-phase, in the 21st century, Bower's Hill may become even more of a transportation hub. ==External links== *Roads to the Future website *Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) Hampton Roads official website *Virginia Dept. of Rail and Public Transportation official website Category:Chesapeake, Virginia communities ","title":"Bower's Hill, Virginia"},{"id":"1428087","text":"Location of Ladner, British Columbia Barber Island, Duck Island, Gunn Island and Port Guichon in the Fraser River Estuary Ladner is a part of the City of Delta, British Columbia, Canada, and a suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia. It was created as a fishing village on the banks of the Fraser River. Named for Thomas and William Ladner, who came to the area in 1868 and began large farming and fishing operations, it developed as a centre for these operations. A series of ferries, culminating in the Ladner Ferry, allowed for access across the river to Richmond. The George Massey Tunnel provided a permanent connection in 1959. ==History== Like many areas around the Fraser River on what is now Greater Vancouver the area on the south side of the south arm of the Fraser was named for the original Europeans to settle there. First called Ladner's Landing, the area was settled by Thomas Ellis Ladner (1837‚Äì1922) and William Henry Ladner (1826‚Äì1907). The History of Metropolitan Vancouver's Hall of Fame They had travelled from their home in Cornwall, UK to pursue the gold rush in California and later on the Fraser River. Settling on the area of the Fraser River Delta either side of the Chilukthan Slough in 1868, both turned to farming and fishing.Ladner britishcolumbia.com ==Location and features== Ladner is bound to the west by the Strait of Georgia, the south by Tsawwassen, to the east by North Delta, and north by the Fraser River. Ladner is bisected by Highway 17A, which runs north-south from Highway 99 to the BC Ferries terminal. The term East Ladner is often applied to the portion of the community east of Highway 17A. The major east-west artery is called Ladner Trunk Road - which, if traveled far enough east, turns into Highway 10. West of Arthur Drive, a north-south road that connects it with Tsawwassen, it is simply called 47A Avenue. Ladner ferry dock, at the end of Ferry Road, in Captain's Cove. River Road runs east from the north end of Highway 17A along the Fraser River into North Delta and Surrey. The area between Highway 17A and North Delta is referred to as Tilbury and is one of the major industrial centres of the Lower Mainland, with many large warehouses, industrial parks and factories. Lying to the south of the delta of the Fraser River, there are numerous islands just off the mainland that are part of Ladner. Most are small and only reachable by boat, with exceptions like Westham Island, which hosts a large bird sanctuary and is dedicated to protecting and preserving the numerous bird species found in the area, especially bald eagles and various owl species. Westham Island is a fairly large island and a popular destination for its numerous organic farms, especially its berry farms. Captain's Cove Marina in north LadnerA major feature of Ladner is the portion called Ladner Village, which is in the section of the town north of Ladner Trunk Road and west of Arthur Drive. This is a heritage community with wide, boulevarded sidewalks, open-air cafes and local shops. There are some heritage residences in this area, mostly built in the 1930s, but apartment complexes replaced many of them some decades back. The Delta Museum and Archives are in the centre of Ladner Village, along with a town clock that is amongst the oldest in the Lower Mainland. On Ladner Trunk Road, east of Arthur Drive, two malls with supermarkets, major restaurants and other modern shops and services are found. The town is experiencing a boom of condominium development in this area, and the population is growing accordingly. Numerous parks are found throughout the community, especially along the canals which used to be used for transport through the area. No longer passable for boats, today they are still clean and fresh enough to allow fishing along their banks. Ladner is home to two public swimming pools, one of which is an older outdoor facility located near the public library and community centre. A much larger pool is located on Harvest Drive next to the Municipal Hall in the Ladner Leisure Centre. This indoor pool features a large 25m main pool, a smaller leisure pool, a swirl pool, sauna and rock climbing wall. Also located in this facility is a skating rink and a gymnasium partially funded by Vancouver's Junior Hockey Team, the Vancouver Giants. Ladner is the location of the Delta Municipal Hall, police station, and the Delta Hospital. Public education is administered by School District 37 Delta. Schools include Delta Secondary School and K-7 elementary schools including Hawthorne, Holly, Ladner, Port Guichon and Neilson Grove Elementary School. Independent K-7 schools Sacred Heart and Delta Christian also serve local students. On March 1, 2006, Ladner made national headlines when an out-of-control house party resulted in hospitalization of the 13-year- old host for alcohol poisoning and nearly CA$70,000 in damage. A 13-year-old boy was also hospitalized with injuries to his head, with temporary memory loss.Edmonton Sun, March 1, 2006 ==Holidays and attractions== Each spring Ladner hosts the Ladner Pioneer May Days (commonly referred to by residents simply as May Days), the longest-running festival in Delta, which was first celebrated in 1896. It is held on the weekend following the holiday commemorating Queen Victoria's birthday. It includes a parade, a carnival, and many other local events. Every other Sunday during the summer months the major streets in the village are reserved for Ladner Village Market, a farmer's market featuring live music, food, entertainment, fresh local produce and homemade arts and crafts. Vendors from as far away as Kelowna and Vancouver Island, along with many local farmers and artisans, set up stalls selling hand-crafted and locally grown products. This market has become a major draw to the community, attracting thousands of out-of-town visitors each market day. In September 2008 Ladner and Delta hosted Delta Rivermania, a celebration of the 200th anniversary of Simon Fraser's journey down the Fraser River. It was a weekend long event that lasted from September 26‚Äì28, 2008. It included theatrical performances, a pancake breakfast, clam chowder cookoff, midnight market and street entertainment. It was the final weekend of BC Rivermania celebrations, part of the BC 150. ==Telecommunications== Delta is serviced by Telus and Eastlink, which acquired Delta Cable, for television, Internet, and telephone services, one of the very few areas in Canada not serviced by Rogers Cable nor Shaw Cable. Telephone services are run primarily by Telus. Within area code 604, the central office code servicing Ladner for years was 946 but, as the population expanded, new exchanges ‚Äî 940 in the early 1990s and 952 recently ‚Äî were added. ==Ladner in film== The Ladner Village area is popular with film crews for its \\"Main Street USA\\" feel, quaint coastal fishing settings, and heritage church buildings. The general South Delta area also provides open landscapes of farmland, ocean beaches, forest and wetlands, all within a few kilometres of each other. These features make the area a popular location for movie productions such as the Air Bud series, Final Destination, Along Came a Spider, 3000 Miles to Graceland, Josie and the Pussycats, Deck the Halls, X-Men: The Last Stand, Shooter, Home Is Where The Hart Is, A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner!, 50/50, and Fifty Shades of Grey, as well as various television productions such as Smallville, The X-Files, Stargate SG-1, Supernatural, The Sandlot trilogy, Three Moons Over Milford, Impastor, The Secret Circle, and Bates Motel. It has recently been the main filming location for A Dog's Way Home, and a show based on Stephen King's The Stand is currently filming in Ladner. ==Notable residents== * Will Sasso, a comedic actor most famous for his casting on the hit sketch comedy series Mad TVhttps://www.imdb.com/name/nm0766005/ * Enuka Okuma, actress, appeared in Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye and Madisonhttp://suethomasdvd.com/th_gallery/enuka-okuma/ * Doreen Patterson Reitsma, Wren in the Royal Canadian Navyhttp://www.whoislog.info/profile/doreen-patterson-reitsma.html * Bill Vander Zalm, 28th Premier of British Columbiahttp://talkdigitalnetwork.com/author/bill-van-der-zam/ * Marie Warder, writer and founder of the Canadian Hemochromatosis Societyhttp://www.abcbookworld.com/view_author.php?id=4441 * James Paxton, Major League Baseball pitcher for the New York Yankees * Ivan Decker, Stand-up comedian and radio personality heard on hit CBC radio program The Debaters and Netflix Comedians of the World Series https://www.straight.com/arts/365926/ivan-deckers-mean-clean-laugh-machine * Manoj Sood, actor, most famous for the role of Baber Siddiqui in \\"Little Mosque on the Prairie\\" * Linus Sebastian, YouTube personality and host of LinusTechTipshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvL3Pyg5lRE&t;=26s ==References== ==External links== *The Corporation of Delta *Ladner - britishcolumbia.com Category:Neighbourhoods in Delta, British Columbia Category:Populated places on the Fraser River Category:Fishing villages ","title":"Ladner, British Columbia"},{"id":"1428088","text":"The pseudorange (from pseudo- and range) is the pseudo distance between a satellite and a navigation satellite receiver (see GNSS positioning calculation) ‚Äîfor instance Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. To determine its position, a satellite navigation receiver will determine the ranges to (at least) four satellites as well as their positions at time of transmitting. Knowing the satellites' orbital parameters, these positions can be calculated for any point in time. The pseudoranges of each satellite are obtained by multiplying the speed of light by the time the signal has taken from the satellite to the receiver. As there are accuracy errors in the time measured, the term pseudo-ranges is used rather than ranges for such distances. ==Pseudorange and time error estimation== Typically a quartz oscillator is used in the receiver to do the timing. The accuracy of quartz clocks in general is worse (i.e. more) than one part in a million; thus, if the clock hasn't been corrected for a week, the deviation may be so great as to result in a reported location not on the Earth, but outside the Moon's orbit. Even if the clock is corrected, a second later the clock may no longer be usable for positional calculation, because after a second the error will be hundreds of meters for a typical quartz clock. But in a GPS receiver the clock's time is used to measure the ranges to different satellites at almost the same time, meaning all the measured ranges have the same error. Ranges with the same error are called pseudoranges. By finding the pseudo-range of an additional fourth satellite for precise position calculation, the time error can also be estimated. Therefore, by having the pseudoranges and the locations of four satellites, the actual receiver's position along the x, y, z axes and the time error \\\\Delta t can be computed accurately. The reason we speak of pseudo-ranges rather than ranges, is precisely this \\"contamination\\" with unknown receiver clock offset. GPS positioning is sometimes referred to as trilateration, but would be more accurately referred to as pseudo- trilateration. Following the laws of error propagation, neither the receiver position nor the clock offset are computed exactly, but rather estimated through a least squares adjustment procedure known from geodesy. To describe this imprecision, so-called GDOP quantities have been defined: geometric dilution of precision (x,y,z,t). Pseudorange calculations therefore use the signals of four satellites to compute the receiver's location and the clock error. A clock with an accuracy of one in a million will introduce an error of one millionth of a second each second. This error multiplied by the speed of light gives an error of 300 meters. For a typical satellite constellation this error will increase by about \\\\textstyle{\\\\sqrt 2} (less if satellites are close together, more if satellites are all near the horizon). If positional calculation was done using this clock and only using three satellites, just standing still the GPS would indicate that you are traveling at a speed in excess of 300 meters per second, (over 1000 km/hour or 600 miles an hour). With only signals from three satellites the GPS receiver would not be able to determine whether the 300m/s was due to clock error or actual movement of the GPS receiver. If the satellites being used are scattered throughout the sky, then the value of geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) is low while if satellites are clustered near each other from the receiver's vantage point the GDOP values are higher. The lower the value of GDOP then the better the ratio of position error to range error computing will be, so GDOP plays an important role in calculating the receiver's position on the surface of the earth using pseudoranges. The larger the number of satellites, the better the value of GDOP will be. == References == * Peter J. G.

Bobcaygeon was incorporated as a village in 1876, and became known as the \\"Hub of the Kawarthas\\". Its recorded name bob-ca-je-wan-unk comes either from the Mississauga Ojibway word baabaagwaajiwanaang \\"at the very shallow currents\\", giishkaabikojiwanaang \\"at the cliffed cascades\\" or obaabikojiwanaang \\"at currented rocky narrows\\", or from the French beau bocage \\"beautiful hedged farmland\\". The first lock in the Trent-Severn Waterway was built in Bobcaygeon in 1833. The town is situated on three islands, along with the main land. Bobcaygeon's chief industry is tourism, particularly related to recreational fishing. Bobcaygeon is a hub for the region, providing many of the services unavailable in the smaller neighbouring communities. ==History== Samuel de Champlain passed through Bobcaygeon with a band of Hurons during his 1615 military expedition. By the early 1830s, the government of Upper Canada had completed its survey of the Township of Verulam and the area began to attract settlers. Thomas Need, who arrived in 1832 is recognized as one of the earliest settlers of the Township of Verulam and is the founder of Bobcaygeon. With his purchase of 3000 acres (12 km2) of land, Need built a sawmill, gristmill, and the first store. In 1833, the government began construction of a lock and canal at the narrows between Sturgeon and Pigeon Lakes. This was the first lock constructed on the Trent‚ÄìSevern Waterway. Soon a community began to develop around the lock and the Thomas Need's sawmill and gristmill. In the 1850s, the economic development of Bobcaygeon was stimulated by Mossom Boyd's lumbering business. The government had reserved and surveyed a town site on the north bank of Bobcaygeon River between Sturgeon and Pigeon Lakes, which was named Rokeby by visiting Lieutenant Governor Sir John Colborne. Need laid out streets and plotted lots on the island, which was named Bobcaygeon. Today, Bobcaygeon designates both sides of the Bobcaygeon River, after the post office was established on the island by the first postmaster, Thomas Need. In 1844, Thomas Need sold his profitable business interests to Mossom Boyd, and returned to England. Boyd and his sons built up a logging enterprise that was recognized as the third largest logging operation in Upper Canada. In addition to timbering, the Boyds also operated a system of steamboats under the name Trent Valley Navigation Company as well as an experimental beefalo herd on Boyd Island. Descendants of this herd remain in Alberta. By 1869, Bobcaygeon was a village with a population of 800 in the Township of Verulam County, Victoria County.

A group of local businessmen worked for many years to bring a railway into Bobcaygeon. Sir Sam Hughes sat on the board of the Lindsay, Pontypool & Bobcaygeon Railway. The line was leased to the Canadian Pacific Railway on completion. In July 1904 the first passenger train steamed into town. The service lasted until 1957, the railway lands becoming the Beach Park. The village government joined with the Township of Verulam in 1999. In 2000, it was amalgamated with the other municipalities of Victoria County by the provincial government following the recommendations of the Victoria County Restructuring Commission, led by commissioner Harry Kitchen. Now Bobcaygeon exists as a community within the City of Kawartha Lakes. == Education == *Bobcaygeon Public School ==Media== *The Bobcaygeon Independent was the local newspaper, established in 1869.

Doug, Rawle D. Lewis, Malik Yoba, and John Candy. The film was released in the United States on October 1, 1993. It was Candy's last film to be released during his lifetime. It is loosely based on the true story of the Jamaica national bobsleigh team's debut in competition during the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The film received generally positive reviews. The film's soundtrack also became popular with Jimmy Cliff's cover of \\"I Can See Clearly Now\\" reaching the top 40 as a single in nations such as the United States, Canada, France, and the UK. ==Plot== In November 1987, Jamaican sprinter Derice Bannock, a top 100m runner and popular town figure, trains one morning with locals for the upcoming Olympic Trial for the 1988 Summer Olympics, which has been a long-time dream of his. He later meets his best friend, Sanka Coffie, a six-time pushcart champion, at the Annual Pushcart Derby, where Sanka hopes to win his record seventh race. During the race, Sanka smart-talks past the others and wins, but is then pushed off the track by a nearby racer and crashes. Later at the Olympic Trial, Derice fails to qualify when a fellow younger runner trips and falls, taking Derice and another runner - who is bald and more muscular - down with him. While complaining to the President of the Jamaican Olympic Committee, Mr. Barrington Coolidge, and urging him to allow a restart of the race, Derice notices a picture on the wall of Coolidge's office: it is his own father Ben Bannock, who was also a sprinter, standing next to a gold-medal-wearing Caucasian man. Asking Coolidge who the other man in the picture is, he learns that he is Irv Blitzer, an old Olympian friend of Ben who had a plan to recruit sprinters to create a Jamaican bobsled team years ago, and was a two- time American bobsled Gold Medalist at the 1968 Winter Olympics. He finished first in two events again during the 1972 Winter Olympics but was disqualified from the latter for cheating and retired in disgrace to Jamaica, where he leads an impoverished life as a bookie. Intrigued at the idea of getting to the Olympics via bobsledding for Jamaica, Derice leaves Coolidge's office to seek out Blitzer. Before meeting with Blitzer, Derice first seeks out Sanka to get him to join his bobsled team, successfully convincing Sanka after he mentions possible fame on a Wheaties box. They both then go to seek out Blitzer at a nearby Billiards Club. Blitzer is initially hostile and refuses to speak to them; after repeated attempts, Derice finally manages to tell him that he's Ben Bannocks' son and reminds him of his former Olympic dreams, which eventually convinces Blitzer. Hosting a recruitment meeting shortly after, Irv, Derice, and Sanka are disappointed when all the recruits leave after a presentation; however at the end, two familiar men show up - the other runners who fell alongside Derice in the earlier Olympic qualifying race. Both men agree to join the team, although the bald and muscular one, with the unlikely name of Yul Brenner, is still upset over being tripped by the younger runner, Junior Bevil. Over the next several weeks, the four train under Blitzer's guidance, using a wheeled bobsled that they ride down on hillsides; overtime, they improve both their speed and sled coordination. Blitzer eventually tries to talk to Mr. Coolidge to fund them the $20,000 needed to go to the Winter Olympics, but Mr. Coolidge refuses as he thinks the team's inexperience will embarrass the nation. Undeterred, the four sledders try to find various ways to earn money to get in the Olympics, but no sponsor takes the idea seriously and their various fundraisers such as busking and a kissing booth all fail. Junior eventually gets the money by selling his car, and the team heads off to Canada. In Calgary, Blitzer officially registers the team and manages to acquire a practice sled from an old bobsledding teammate Roger, as the Jamaicans have never been in an actual bobsled nor practiced on ice. In the following weeks, they observe ice skaters and hockey players as they practice walking on ice, and workout intensely to gain strength and cold endurance. Derice is particularly inspired by the Swiss Bobsledders' technique and watches their practice runs. In their own practice runs, with their unadorned practice sled, the Jamaicans initially do poorly and are looked down upon by other countries; the East German team is particularly annoyed with them, and their arrogant leader, Josef Grool, tells them to go home, resulting in a bar fight. At the hotel room, Derice and Blitzer reprimand Sanka, Yul, and Junior for their behavior, and Blitzer reminds Sanka, Yul, and Junior what is at stake for the team if they do not start listening to him and Derice. The team resolves to view the contest more seriously, continuing to train and improve their technique, while Yul and Junior begin showing mutual respect for one another over their respective dreams and struggles. The team successfully qualifies for the finals, but are subsequently disqualified due to a technicality which the Olympic committee trotted out as retribution for Blitzer's prior cheating scandal. Frustrated, Blitzer butts in on the committee meeting and confronts his former coach from the 1972 Olympic Winter Games, Kurt Hemphill, now a primary judge of the 1988 Olympic Winter Games. He takes responsibility for embarrassing his country with the scandal and implores the committee to punish him for his mistake, but not punish the Jamaican team, as they had nothing to do with his cheating scandal. Blitzer reminds them that the Jamaicans deserve to represent their country by competing in the Winter Games as contenders. That night at their hotel, the team gets a phone call informing them that the committee has reversed its decision and allows the Jamaicans to compete once again. After attending the Olympics opening ceremony, the team receives a visit from Junior's father, Mr. Bevil, who wants to bring Junior back home, but Junior stands his ground that he must forge his own path in life, earning Yul's respect. The Jamaicans' first day on the track results in more embarrassment and a last place finish. Sanka identifies the problem as Derice trying to copy the Swiss team which he idolizes and convinces him that the best they can do is bobsled \\"Jamaican\\". Once the team develops their own style and tradition, the second day improves; the Jamaican team finishes with a fast time which puts them in eighth position. Derice asks Blitzer about why he decided to cheat despite his gold medals and prestige. He tells Derice he aspired to make winning his whole life, citing that \\"a gold medal is a wonderful thing, but if you're not enough without it, you'll never be enough with it;\\". Blitzer says that when the Olympics are over, Derice will know if he can think of himself as a champion, medal or no medal. For the first half of the final day's race, it looks as though the team will push into medal contention, until, due to the sled being old, one of the sled's blades detaches from a loosening screw, causing it to flip onto its side as it comes out of a turn, leaving the team meters short of the finish line. Determined to finish the race, the team lift the sled over their shoulders and walk across the finish line to rousing applause from spectators, including Grool, Hemphill, and Junior's father. The team, at the end, feel accomplished enough to return in four years to the next Olympics. A photographer takes a photo of the team, which Mr. Coolidge is seen later adding to his wall photograph collection in his office, adding it just above the photo of Blitzer and Ben Bannock taken 20 years earlier. A brief epilogue states the team returned to Jamaica as heroes, and upon their return to the Winter Olympics four years later, they were treated as equals. ==Cast== * Leon Robinson as Derice Bannock * Doug E.

It wasn't funny enough, the key elements were lacking, and it just wasn't working. It was meant to happen when it happened.\\" Leon, Doug E. Doug and Malik Yoba have all confirmed in their interview with Empire that it was originally meant to have been a serious sports drama film. The film's working title was Blue Maaga. Before Jon Turteltaub was officially hired, Jeremiah S. Chechik was slated to direct until he moved on to do Benny & Joon (1993) instead. Brian Gibson was also considered to direct, but he dropped out to do What's Love Got to Do with It (1993) instead. Turteltaub used actual ABC sports footage from the 1988 Olympics and incorporated it into the film. ===Casting=== According to Leon, \\"The script has been following me around for 3 years.\\" Leon signed on when Gibson was then the director at the time. Leon told The Seattle Times, \\"I was signed more than a year before we actually started.\\" Doug got involved with the film in 1990: \\"I found Cool Runnings three years ago, when my agent had it on his desk. I knew about the actual event it's based on, the Jamaican bobsled team that went to the '88 Olympics, and even though it's based pretty loosely I thought it made a great yarn.\\" At the time of Doug's audition, Chechik was attached as the director. Doug told The Baltimore Sun: \\"I got the offer to play Sanka, the guy I'd wanted to play from the very beginning.\\" Lewis had very little experience and was not even allowed to audition at first. He told The Seattle Times, \\"I was hired to read lines to auditioning actors for just one day. That turned into three weeks. At first they told me they were looking for names, big stars, so I wouldn't be considered, but then they asked me to do a screen test.\\" He also told The Baltimore Sun, \\"I came in to this film at first to coach the players in the authentic accents.\\" Lewis was officially hired in November 1992. When asked by Empire how he got involved with the film, Yoba was introduced to the casting director, Jackie Brown, by \\"a gentleman by the name of Jamal Joseph.\\" At the time of Yoba's official casting, Gibson was still slated to direct. Yoba later told Entertainment Weekly that he wrote the Jamaican bobsled song for his audition. Lewis claimed that the executives at Disney wanted Kurt Russell for the role of Coach Blitzer. However, John Candy personally insisted on portraying the coach and agreed to take a pay cut to do the movie. According to Yoba, Scott Glenn was also considered for the role. Cuba Gooding, Jr., Jeffrey Wright, and Eriq La Salle were each considered for a role as one of the four Jamaican bobsledders. ===Filming locations=== The film was shot in Calgary and Jamaica in February and March 1993. The cast and crew filmed in Calgary first, to take advantage of the snow. Then they filmed at the Jamaican parishes of Discovery Bay and Kingston. Dawn Steel was on the set every day in Calgary and Jamaica. According to Leon, \\"(Steel) worked on the second unit for a while, and she said 'Never again. I never want to direct. ==Music== A soundtrack album with 11 tracks was released by Sony in 1993 on compact disc (Columbia Chaos OK 57553). In some European countries, the soundtrack album was released by Sony with a 12th (bonus) track being \\"Rise Above It\\" performed by Lock Stock and Barrel (Columbia 474840 2). Songs from the soundtrack also featured in a little known musical \\"Rasta in the Snow\\", which was based on events of the real Jamaican sled team. ==Reception== The film received positive reviews, including one from Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times which referred to the film as \\"a sweet-natured, high-spirited comedy, that rare movie that plays effectively to all ages. Even rarer, it celebrates genuine sportsmanship, placing the emphasis back on how the game is played in the face of the winning-is-everything philosophy that permeates every aspect of contemporary life.\\" Richard Harrington of The Washington Post wrote \\"a wholesome, engaging, frequently hilarious, ultimately inspirational film.\\" Cool Runnings has received a rating of 76% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 41 reviews, with 31 positive and 10 negative, and also received an 81% rating from users. The site's consensus states \\"Cool Runnings rises above its formulaic sports-movie themes with charming performances, light humor, and uplifting tone.\\" The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2006: AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers ‚Äì Nominated * 2008: AFI's 10 Top 10: ** Nominated Sports Film ===Box office=== The film debuted at . The film had total domestic earnings of $68,856,263 in the United States and Canada, and $86,000,000 internationally (with $416,771 earned in Jamaica), for a total of $154,856,263 worldwide. ==Differences between real life and film== Cool Runnings was loosely based on real life events surrounding the formation of the Jamaican bobsled team. The movie is mainly composed of fictional characters. Some of the incidents that occurred in the film were real, such as the favorites to win the four-man event beating the Swiss team (which they did), and the crash that eliminated the Jamaicans from further competition. However, there were several creative liberties taken by the filmmakers in order to complete the story. ===Characters=== The members of the team in the film are fictional characters, although the people who conceived the idea of a Jamaican bobsled team were inspired by pushcart racers and tried to recruit top track sprinters. However, they did not find any elite sprinters interested in competing and instead recruited four sprinters from the Air Force for the team. Irving \\"Irv\\" Blitzer is a fictional character. The real team had several trainers, none of whom were connected to any cheating scandal. At the time of the movie's release, the United States had not won a gold medal in bobsleigh at the Winter Olympics in the four man event since 1948, and did not win the gold again until 2010. In the film, the team is formed by Jamaican sprinters after failing to qualify for the 1988 Summer Olympics. The Jamaican Summer Olympic Trials would have occurred following the Winter Olympics in Calgary. ===Organization=== A fictional all-encompassing winter sports governing body, the \\"International Alliance of Winter Sports\\", appears in the film. In reality, each Winter Olympic Sport has its own governing body, and bobsledding falls under the jurisdiction of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (or FIBT, the initials of its French name). The International Olympic Committee (IOC) did temporarily disqualify the Jamaicans, but it was not an appeal by the coach that led the IOC to reverse this decision. Prince Albert of Monaco was among those who made the successful appeal. ===Competition=== One of the most fictionalized parts of Cool Runnings is the competition itself. The bobsled competition in the film consists of three individual runs held on three consecutive days, whereas in reality, the Olympic bobsled competition consists of four runs - two runs a day held over two consecutive days. In the film, the Jamaicans are regarded as unwelcome outsiders to the Games by other countries (particularly East Germany) and ridiculed. In reality, the Jamaicans were treated as equals and there was no real animosity between the team and their competitors; in fact, the Jamaicans were aided by the United States team who lent them one of their backup sleds so they could qualify, so they did not have to buy another team's spare sled. While the Jamaicans did crash their bobsled on their fourth and final run, the film implied the team was a medal contender, having run a world record pace prior to the crash. In reality, they were in 24th place (out of 26) after their first run was completed in 58.04. Their second run was completed in 59.37, which was the next-to-worst time (25th). On the third run, they had the worst time (1:03.19, good for 26th place), which was almost five seconds behind the 25th fastest run. Of the 103 runs that were completed in the four- man competition, nobody else posted a time over one minute. So going into the final run, the Jamaicans were in 26th (last) place with a cumulative time of 3:00.60 after three runs. This placed them 3.23 seconds behind Portugal for 25th place, and 10.19 seconds behind the USSR team that was in third-place heading into the final run. They would have had to complete a world-record shattering time under 48.00 seconds to bring home a medal. ===Crash=== In the film, the crash happens on the third run and is depicted to have been caused by a mechanical failure in the front left blade of the sled. As the driver steers, a nut and bolt on the control column work loose, eventually causing a loss of control as the bobsleigh comes out of a turn and subsequently crashes. In reality, the crash happened in the fourth and final run, and it was deemed that driver inexperience, excess speed, and regressing the turn too high caused the sled to become unstable and top-heavy seconds prior to it toppling onto its left side. Real TV footage of the actual crash was used in the film but was heavily edited to fit in with the film's version of the crash. Both the run and the high speed crash were disorienting: team member Nelson Chris Stokes \\"felt a bump\\" when they tipped but did not realize they had turned over until he started to smell his helmet (which was fiberglass) friction-burning on the ice, \\"which is something that stays with you for many years afterward.\\" After the crash, the film depicted the Jamaicans carrying their sled on their shoulders to the finish to a slow-building standing ovation. In reality, they did not carry the sled but walked next to it. When the sled tipped, they were doing 80 miles per hour (130 km per hour), and their helmets scraped against the wall for until they came to a stop. They also received somewhat sporadic applause, less than the crescendo response in the movie, but the real bobsled driver Dudley Stokes cites the spectator applause as the reason the run turned from tragedy to triumph for him. ===Four-man sled vs two-man sled=== The film also gives the impression that the Jamaicans were the only team from Central America and the Caribbean. This was the case in the four-man sled competition, which the movie focuses on. However, in the two-man competition there was also a bobsled team from Netherlands Antilles which finished 29th (one place ahead of Jamaica's two-man sled team) and two teams from United States Virgin Islands which finished 35th and 38th. The film focuses entirely on the four- man bobsled team, which crashed their sled and finished last out of the 26 teams, as all 25 other teams were able to complete all four runs. However, it ignores the fact that two members of the team (Dudley Stokes and Michael White) also competed in the two-man sled competition and successfully completed all four runs, finishing in 30th place out of 38 teams that finished all runs, with three other teams which did not finish. The remaining members of the four man sled team were Devon Harris and Chris Stokes (Dudley's younger brother). In fact the whole formation of the bob-sleigh project as depicted in the film is incorrect. The film depicts them as forming the team as a four-man bobsleigh team right from the start. However, in reality, they started the project intending to compete in the two-man bobsleigh event only. They only decided to compete in the four-man event after having already completed the two-man event in Calgary. ===Other differences=== In the movie, the weather is depicted as bitterly cold with a temperature of . Actual temperatures in Calgary during the Games were well above normal, including some daytime highs above .https://adiabat.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/winter-olympics-weather-in- context/ ==Home media== On November 11, 1994, the film was released on VHS and laserdisc by Walt Disney Home Video in the United States.

Anti-icing is understood to be the application of chemicals that not only de-ice but also remain on a surface and continue to delay the reformation of ice for a certain period of time, or prevent adhesion of ice to make mechanical removal easier. == Approaches == De-icing can be accomplished by mechanical methods (scraping, pushing); through the application of heat; by use of dry or liquid chemicals designed to lower the freezing point of water (various salts or brines, alcohols, glycols); or by a combination of these different techniques. === Trains and rail switches === Ice build up in train brakes jeopardizes braking efficiency. Trains and rail switches in arctic regions have large problems with snow and ice build up. They need a constant heat source in cold days to assure functionality. On trains it is primarily the brakes, suspension and couplers that require heaters for de-icing. On rails it is primarily the switches that are sensitive to ice. These high-powered electrical heaters efficiently prevent ice formation and rapidly melt any ice that forms. The heaters are preferably made of PTC material, e.g. PTC rubber, to avoid overheating and potentially destroying the heaters. These heaters are self-limiting and require no regulating electronics; they cannot overheat and require no overheat protection.2012 Autumn & Winter Season (Drivers' Briefing). London, UK: First Capital Connect. September 2012. === Aircraft === A U.S. Gulfstream G550 gets de-iced before departing Alaska in January 2012 A WestJet 737-700 deicing in Toronto On the ground, when there are freezing conditions and precipitation, de-icing an aircraft is commonly practiced. Frozen contaminants interfere with the aerodynamic properties of the vehicle. Furthermore, dislodged ice can damage the engines. De-icing fluids typically consist of a glycol-water solution containing a dye and agents to protect the metal surface. A range of glycols are employed. Thickeners are also used to help the deicing agent adhere to the airplane body. Ethylene glycol (EG) fluids are still in use for aircraft de-icing in some parts of the world because it has a lower operational use temperature (LOUT) than propylene glycol (PG). However, PG is more common because it is less toxic than ethylene glycol. When applied, most of the de-icing fluid does not adhere to the aircraft surfaces, and falls to the ground. Airports typically use containment systems to capture the used liquid, so that it cannot seep into the ground and water courses. Even though PG is classified as non-toxic, it pollutes waterways since it consumes large amounts of oxygen as it decomposes, causing aquatic life to suffocate. (See Environmental impacts and mitigation.) ==== Infrared heating de-icing ==== Direct infrared heating has also been developed as an aircraft de-icing technique. This heat transfer mechanism is substantially faster than conventional heat transfer modes used by conventional de-icing (convection and conduction) due to the cooling effect of the air on the de-icing fluid spray. One infrared de-icing system requires that the heating process take place inside a specially-constructed hangar. This system has had limited interest among airport operators, due to the space and related logistical requirements for the hangar. In the United States, this type of infrared de-icing system has been used, on a limited basis, at two large hub airports and one small commercial airport. Another infrared system uses mobile, truck-mounted heating units that do not require the use of hangars. Report prepared for Transport Canada. The manufacturer claims that the system can be used for both fixed wing aircraft and helicopters, although it has not cited any instances of its use on commercial aircraft. === Airport pavement === De-icing operations for airport pavement (runways, taxiways, aprons, taxiway bridges) may involve several types of liquid and solid chemical products, including propylene glycol, ethylene glycol and other organic compounds. Chloride-based compounds (e.g. salt) are not used at airports, due to their corrosive effect on aircraft and other equipment. Urea mixtures have also been used for pavement de-icing, due to their low cost. However, urea is a significant pollutant in waterways and wildlife, as it degrades to ammonia after application, and it has been largely been phased out at U.S. airports. In 2012 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prohibited use of urea-based deicers at most commercial airports. === Roadways === In 2013, an estimated 14M tons of salt were used for deicing roads in North America. De-icing of roads has traditionally been done with salt, spread by snowplows or dump trucks designed to spread it, often mixed with sand and gravel, on slick roads. Sodium chloride (rock salt) is normally used, as it is inexpensive and readily available in large quantities. However, since salt water still freezes at , it is of no help when the temperature falls below this point. It also has a strong tendency to cause corrosion, rusting the steel used in most vehicles and the rebar in concrete bridges. Depending on the concentration, it can be toxic to some plants and animals, and some urban areas have moved away from it as a result. More recent snowmelters use other salts, such as calcium chloride and magnesium chloride, which not only depress the freezing point of water to a much lower temperature, but also produce an exothermic reaction. They are somewhat safer for sidewalks, but excess should still be removed. More recently, organic compounds have been developed that reduce the environmental issues connected with salts and have longer residual effects when spread on roadways, usually in conjunction with salt brines or solids. These compounds are often generated as byproducts of agricultural operations such as sugar beet refining or the distillation process that produces ethanol. Other organic compounds are wood ash and a deicing salt called calcium magnesium acetate made from roadside grass or even kitchen waste.The alternatives to salt for battling ice: cheese, beets and ash Additionally, mixing common rock salt with some of the organic compounds and magnesium chloride results in spreadable materials that are both effective to much colder temperatures () as well as at lower overall rates of spreading per unit area. Solar road systems have been used to maintain the surface of roads above the freezing point of water. An array of pipes embedded in the road surface is used to collect solar energy in summer, transfer the heat to thermal banks and return the heat to the road in winter to maintain the surface above . This automated form of renewable energy collection, storage and delivery avoids the environmental issues of using chemical contaminants. It was suggested in 2012 that superhydrophobic surfaces capable of repelling water can also be used to prevent ice accumulation leading to icephobicity. However, not every superhydrophobic surface is icephobic and the method is still under development. === Chemical de-icers=== All chemical de-icers share a common working mechanism: they chemically prevent water molecules from binding above a certain temperature that depends on the concentration. This temperature is below 0 ¬∞C, the freezing point of pure water. Sometimes, there is an exothermic dissolution reaction that allows for an even stronger melting power. The following lists contains the most- commonly used de-icing chemicals and their typical chemical formula. ;Inorganic salts * Sodium chloride (NaCl or table salt; the most common de- icing chemical) * Magnesium chloride (, often added to salt to lower its working temperature) * Calcium chloride (, often added to salt to lower its working temperature) * Potassium chloride (KCl) ;Organic compounds * Calcium magnesium acetate () * Potassium acetate () * Potassium formate () * Sodium formate (HCOONa) * Calcium formate () * Urea (), a common fertilizer * Agricultural By-Products (generally used as additives to sodium chloride) ;Alcohols, diols and polyols (these are antifreeze agents and scarcely used on roads) * Methanol () * Ethylene glycol () * Propylene glycol () * Glycerol () === Fluid types === An aircraft being de-iced at upright=1.2 An aircraft being de-iced at Birmingham Airport with an orange-colored anti-icing fluid There are several types of aircraft de-icing fluid, falling into two basic categories: # De-icing fluids: Heated glycol diluted with water for de-icing and snow/frost removal, also referred to as Newtonian fluids (owing to their viscous flow similar to water) # Anti-icing fluids: unheated, undiluted propylene glycol based fluids that has been thickened (imagine half-set gelatin), also referred to as non-Newtonian fluids (owing to their characteristic viscous flow), applied to retard the future development of ice or to prevent falling snow or sleet from accumulating. Anti-icing fluids provide holdover protection against the formation of ice while the aircraft is stationary on the ground. However, when subjected to shearing force such as the air flow over the fluid surface, when an aircraft is accelerating for takeoff, the fluid's entire rheology changes and it becomes significantly thinner, running off to leave a clean and smooth aerodynamic surface to the wing. In some cases both types of fluid are applied to aircraft, first the heated glycol/water mixture to remove contaminants, followed by the unheated thickened fluid to keep ice from reforming before the aircraft takes off. This is called \\"a two-step procedure\\". Methanol de-ice fluid has been employed for years to de-ice small wing and tail surfaces of small to medium-sized general aviation aircraft and is usually applied with a small hand-held sprayer. Methanol can only remove frost and light ground ice prior to flight. Mono- ethylene, di-ethylene and propylene glycol are non-flammable petroleum products and similar products are most commonly found in automotive cooling systems. Glycol has very good de-icing properties and the aviation grade is referred to as SAE/ISO/AEA Type I (AMS 1424 or ISO 11075). it is usually applied to contaminated surfaces diluted with water at using a cherry picker on a truck containing for on-ramp or departure runway entry point application. Colour-dyed fluid is preferred as it can be confirmed easily by visual observation that an aircraft has received a de-ice application. Runoff of Type I fluid appears to turn slush a pink tinge, hence the term \\"pink snow.\\" Otherwise, all Type I fluids are orange. In 1992, the Dead Sea Works began marketing a de-icer based on salts and minerals from the Dead Sea.Dead Sea product melts snow. (Dead Sea Works markets snow melting compound) == In- flight aircraft de-icing == === Pneumatic systems === Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. The black strips on the leading edges of the tail, stabilizers and wing are de-icing boots made of rubber. In-flight ice buildups are most frequent on the leading edges of the wings, tail and engines (including the propellers or fan blades). Lower speed aircraft frequently use pneumatic de- icing boots on the leading edges of wings and tail for in-flight de-icing. The rubber coverings are periodically inflated, causing ice to crack and flake off. Once the system is activated by the pilot, the inflation/deflation cycle is automatically controlled. In the past, it was thought such systems can be defeated if they are inflated prematurely; if the pilot did not allow a fairly thick layer of ice to form before inflating the boots, the boots would merely create a gap between the leading edge and the formed ice. Recent research shows ‚Äúbridging‚Äù does not occur with modern boots.aopa.org pdf file === Electric systems === Some aircraft may also use electrically heated resistive elements embedded in a rubber sheet cemented to the leading edges of wings and tail surfaces, propeller leading edges, and helicopter rotor blade leading edges. This de-icing system was developed by United States Rubber Company in 1943.for Airplane Propeller is Made of Electric Rubber\\" Popular Mechanics, December 1943 Such systems usually operate continuously. When ice is detected, they first function as de-icing systems, then as anti-icing systems for continued flight in icing conditions. Some aircraft use chemical de-icing systems which pump antifreeze such as alcohol or propylene glycol through small holes in the wing surfaces and at the roots of propeller blades, melting the ice, and making the surface inhospitable to ice formation. A fourth system, developed by NASA, detects ice on the surface by sensing a change in resonance frequency. Once an electronic control module has determined that ice has formed, a large current spike is pumped into the transducers to generate a sharp mechanical shock, cracking the ice layer and causing it to be peeled off by the slipstream. === Air bleed systems === Many modern civil fixed-wing transport aircraft use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above 0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F), preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions. == Environmental impacts and mitigation == De-icing salts such as sodium chloride or calcium chloride leach into natural waters, strongly affecting their salinity. Ethylene glycol and propylene glycol are known to exert high levels of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) during degradation in surface waters. This process can adversely affect aquatic life by consuming oxygen needed by aquatic organisms for survival. Large quantities of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the water column are consumed when microbial populations decompose propylene glycol. Sufficient dissolved oxygen levels in surface waters are critical for the survival of fish, macroinvertebrates, and other aquatic organisms. If oxygen concentrations drop below a minimum level, organisms emigrate, if able and possible, to areas with higher oxygen levels or eventually die. This effect can drastically reduce the amount of usable aquatic habitat. Reductions in DO levels can reduce or eliminate bottom feeder populations, create conditions that favor a change in a community's species profile, or alter critical food-web interactions. In one case, a significant snow in Atlanta in early January 2002 caused an overflow of such a system, briefly contaminating the Flint River downstream of the Atlanta airport. Some airports recycle used de-icing fluid, separating water and solid contaminants, enabling reuse of the fluid in other applications. Other airports have an on-site wastewater treatment facility, and/or send collected fluid to a municipal sewage treatment plant or a commercial wastewater treatment facility. The toxicity of de-icing fluids is another environmental concern, and research is underway to find less toxic (i.e. non- glycol-based) alternatives.U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.

It was based on the literary character Simon Templar created by Leslie Charteris in the 1920s and featured in many novels over the years. He was played by Roger Moore. Templar helps those whom conventional agencies are powerless or unwilling to protect, often using methods that skirt the law. Chief Inspector Claud Eustace Teal is his nominal nemesis who considers Templar a common criminal, but often grudgingly tolerates his actions for the greater good. NBC picked up the show as a summer replacement in its evening schedule in 1966 because of the strong performance in the United States of the first two series in first-run syndication. The programme, therefore, ended its run with both trans-Atlantic primetime scheduling and colour episodes. It also proved popular beyond the UK and US, eventually airing in over 60 countries, and made a profit in excess of ¬£350m for ITC.Television Haven overview of The Saint Time magazine article from 18 April 1969 detailing the premiere of the fifth series of The SaintThe Guardian Robert S Baker obituary, paragraph 3 With almost 120 episodes, the programme is exceeded only by The Avengers as the most productive show of its genre produced in the UK. As with The Avengers, the colour episodes were originally broadcast in the UK in black and white before the advent of colour transmissions on ITV. ==Series overview== Roger Moore had earlier tried to buy the production rights to the Saint books himself, and was delighted to be able to play the part. Moore eventually became co-owner of the show with Robert S. Baker when the show moved to colour and the production credit became Bamore Productions. Most of the wardrobe Moore wore in the series was his own. He was reportedly offered the role of James Bond at least twice during the run of the series, but he had to turn it down both times due to his television commitments. In one early episode of the series (titled \\"Luella\\"), another character actually mistakes Templar for Bond. Moore accepted the Bond role after The Saint ended its run. Moore had a few recurring co-stars, especially Ivor Dean, who played Templar's nemesis, Inspector Teal. In three early episodes, Teal had been played by Campbell Singer, Norman Pitt, and Wensley Pithey; Dean featured from the episode \\"Iris\\" (7 November 1963) onward. Teal's relationship with Templar was broadly similar to that depicted in the novels, but in the series, he is often depicted as bungling, rather than merely Charteris's characterisation of him as an officious, unimaginative policeman. When in France, Templar had a similar relationship with Colonel Latignant (Arnold Diamond). Latignant is depicted as being even less competent than Teal, and is even keener than Teal to find Templar guilty, though Templar repeatedly helps him solve the case. Unlike Teal, Latignant did not appear in Charteris's novels. In all, Inspector Teal featured in 26 episodes and Colonel Latignant in six. The Saint began as a straightforward mystery series, but over the years adopted more secret agent- and fantasy-style plots. It also made a well-publicised switch from black-and-white to colour production midway through its run. The early episodes are distinguished by Moore breaking the fourth wall and speaking to the audience in character at the start of every episode. With the switch to colour, this was replaced by simple narration. The pre-credit sequence usually ended with someone referring to (and/or addressing) the Saint by name ‚Äì \\"Simon Templar\\"; at this point, an animated halo appeared above Templar's head as the Saint looked at the camera (or directly at the halo). Some episodes, such as \\"Iris\\", broke away from this formula and had Templar address the audience for the entire pre-credit sequence and referring to himself by name, setting up the story that followed. Many episodes were based upon Charteris's stories, although a higher percentage of original scripts were used as the series progressed (\\"Queen's Ransom\\" was both the first colour episode and the first episode not to be based on a Charteris work). The novel Vendetta for the Saint, credited to Charteris but written by Harry Harrison, was one of the last Saint stories to be adapted. Some of the later scripts were novelised and published as part of the ongoing series of The Saint novels, such as The Fiction Makers and The People Importers. The first of these books, which gave cover credit to Charteris, but were actually written by others, was The Saint on TV, and the series of novelisations continued for several years after the television programme had ended. The Saint's car used in the series Templar's car, when it appeared, was a white Volvo P1800 with the number plate ST1. This model Volvo is still often referred to as \\"the Saint's car\\", with miniature versions made by Corgi which have proved popular. Volvo was pleased to supply their recently introduced car in 1962 for its promotional value, after Jaguar Cars had rejected a request from the producers to provide an E-type. Moore and guest star Earl Green in \\"Interlude in Venice,\\" 1966 Unlike its contemporary rival, The Avengers, The Saint was shot entirely on film from the beginning, whereas the first three series of the other series (broadcast between 1961 and 1964) were videotaped, with minimal location shooting. All episodes of The Saint were syndicated abroad. The black-and-white series were first syndicated in the US by NBC affiliate stations in 1967 and 1968, and 32 of the 47 colour episodes were broadcast by NBC from 1968 to 1969, and have since played in syndication in the US for many years after (the '70s sequel Return of the Saint aired to high ratings on CBS in 1979‚Äì80). Most series are available on DVD in North America. Two two-part episodes from series 6, \\"Vendetta for the Saint\\" and \\"The Fiction Makers\\", were made into feature films and distributed to theatres in Europe, and often show up on late-night television in America. They are also available on DVD. In the UK, ITV4 has broadcast colour episodes. In the US, FamilyNet and RTV have aired both the black-and-white and colour episodes. Me-TV has also broadcast the series. In March 2015, the CBS-owned Decades digital cable network aired a \\"Series Binge\\" marathon of the show as part of \\"Countdown to Decades\\", a soft-launch prelude to the network's official launch in May 2015. The marathon featured every episode of the series aired back to back. The marathon began on 30 March at 5 pm Eastern Time and ended on 3 April at 11 pm. The broadcast network This TV has been running three or four episodes in a block on Saturday evenings since April 2018, starting at either 11:00pm or midnight (depending on the running time of the movie scheduled to air ahead of it). In October 2018, This TV added a two- episode-per-weekday run at 7:00am, independently sequenced of the continued Saturday night airings. Neither includes the two-part episodes referenced in the previous paragraph. ==Filming locations== In the TV series, the Saint lives in London, though the exact address is never revealed, (53 Grosvenor Mews is his stated address in series 2 episode 2) and he is seen travelling to locations across London, the UK, and around the world. The whole series was shot at Associated British Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, with very few scenes shot on location elsewhere. This was achieved by making extensive use of the sets at Elstree, early blue-screen technology to simulate different locations in the background, painted or projected backdrops, and revolving painted backdrops for moving scenes. A few exceptions exist, such as the extensive location shoot on the island of Malta for \\"Vendetta for the Saint\\". Look-alikes were used for location shoots where the Saint is seen in the distance entering a well-known building or driving past the camera at speed.UK Colour Series DVD Release, disk 8, special feature documentary \\"The Saint Steps In...To Colour\\", narrated by Roger Moore Where it was not possible to do it in the studios, some scenes were shot in North London, such as the block of flats Embassy Lodge in Regents Park Road NW3, which is shown in 5-15 The Persistent Patriots. ==Fan club== The Saint and its books have a fan club created originally by Leslie Charteris for the fans of the series. The club fell under the control of honorary chairmen, Sir Roger Moore (prior to his death) and Ian Ogilvy (who played Templar in the 1970s revival series, ‚Äò‚ÄôReturn of the Saint‚Äô‚Äô). The club marks events such as the publication of books or other information on the series. ==Episodes== The black-and-white episodes of The Saint were made in two production runs, the first, of 39 episodes, was split into two separate series on transmission, and the second, of 32 episodes, again split into two series on transmission. Series five, the first to be produced in colour, consisted of a production run of 32 episodes. The second colour production run consisted of 15 episodes, and has a revamped theme tune, marking it out from the first batch of colour episodes. \\"The Fiction Makers\\" from series five was edited into a two-parter using the revamped theme for inclusion in series six, as was \\"Vendetta for the Saint\\". However, during transmission of series five, transmission of the episodes caught up with production, meaning repeats of some of the black-and-white episodes had to be slotted into the schedule to slow the broadcast of new episodes (this had little impact on viewers, as the colour episodes were being broadcast in black and white anyway). This series started transmission halfway through production, leading to only 26 of the episodes being screened. The three unscreened episodes plus \\"The House on Dragon's Rock\\", which in some regions was not broadcast because it was thought unsuitable for children, were then mixed in with series six for transmission. ==Home releases== A&E; Home Entertainment, under licence from Carlton International Media Limited, released all the episodes of this 1960s British cult spy suspense thriller on DVD in Region 1. They have released two sets of monochrome episodes, the first with three discs, the second with four. Each disc contains four complete, unedited, uncut original broadcast episodes, meaning only 28 of the monochrome episodes are available. Each episode has been completely restored from the original 35MM film prints and digitally remastered in full colour, and was presented in its original UK broadcast presentation and their original US broadcast order. All of the colour episodes have been released in seven two- disc sets, as well as in one 14-disc \\"megaset\\". The two-part episodes are only in movie form. These are currently out of print. A&E; Home Entertainment also released the original monochrome episodes on Region 1 DVD, entitled The Saint: The Early Episodes, in which A&E; had remastered and restored all the black- and-white episodes of the series from the original film elements. On 26 May 2015 Timeless Media Group released The Saint: The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1 for the first time. The 33-disc set features all 118 episodes of the series, as well as bonus features.Official Shout!/TMG Press Release for 'The Complete Series' Set They subsequently released seasons one and two on DVD in a separate 10-disc collection on 13 October 2015.A Timeless Release of 'Seasons 1 and 2,' Starring Roger Moore!

The colour set includes the theatrical versions of the two double-length stories, as well as the original 48-minute two-part versions. Also included are a 40-minute documentary and isolated music tracks. Prior to this, Carlton Video had released four separate discs, the first one with the first two episodes, and the rest with four episodes each. Also, a ten-disc set repackages the previous four discs alongside six more, containing the first 39 monochrome episodes. The monochrome and colour sets are the best out there, in terms of picture, audio quality, and special features. In France, TF1 Vid√©o has released five multidisc sets, containing all the 118 episodes, in French and in English. In Region 4, Umbrella Entertainment released the entire series in Australia, in five boxed sets of six discs each. These are in PAL format, but with no region code. The boxsets feature numerous extras including a series of audio commentaries recorded in 2004 with surviving members of the cast and crew, ranging from guest stars to Roger Moore. ==Revivals/remakes== *In 1978, the series was revived as Return of the Saint, starring Ian Ogilvy as Templar. *Two further attempts were made to revive The Saint on television. In 1987, a 46-minute U.S. TV pilot, \\"The Saint in Manhattan\\", was made starring Australian actor Andrew Clarke; and in 1989, London Weekend Television in the UK made a series of six film-length episodes starring Simon Dutton. *Roger Moore never played the role again after 1969, though he is heard speaking on a car radio during the 1997 film The Saint, starring Val Kilmer as Templar. The final film bore little resemblance to the books or TV series, and carried no credit for Leslie Charteris. The producers bought the rights to use the character's name from Robert S. Baker, who held the rights and had developed and produced both The Saint and Return of the Saint. *In September 2009, it was announced that The Saint was to be remade for television by Vancouver-based studio Brightlight Pictures. Scottish actor Dougray Scott was lined up to play Simon Templar.Broadcastnow.co.uk However, no series eventuated. It was later reported James Purefoy would play The Saint in a remake, production of which was scheduled to begin in July 2011. This project also failed to materialise. *In December 2012, it was announced that Roger Moore would produce a new series, which would star Adam Rayner as Simon Templar and Eliza Dushku as his girlfriend Patricia Holm. In a promotion that was later released, it was also shown that Moore would star in the new series, as would his successor in Return of the Saint, Ian Ogilvy. Production of a pilot episode was completed by early 2013. As of summer 2014, it was awaiting a broadcast time in the U.S. However, the piece underwent reshoots for the ending and add an extra prologue in November 2015, and the pilot episode was retooled as a TV film, The Saint, getting an online release on 12 July 2017, two months after Moore's death. ==References== ==Further reading== *Barer, Paul.

The SRC is responsible for representing students' interests to the management of the University and to local and national government, and for health and welfare issues. Under the Universities (Scotland) Acts, all students of the University automatically become members of the SRC. However, they are entitled to opt out of this. Unlike at other Scottish Universities, the SRC is one of four student bodies on campus, with it being the only representative body sitting on university level committees. It organises numerous events and campaigns during the year including freshers' fair and other freshers' week activities, welfare initiatives, as well as funding over 300 hundred clubs and societies. Since 1968, all of the SRC's offices have been located in the McIntyre Building on University Avenue. ==History== The SRC was founded on 9 March 1886 by a body of students whose primary focus was raising funds to build the GUU. Prior to this the only official representation to the university had been carried out through the office of Rector and rectorial clubs such as the Peel Club formed in 1836. The McIntyre Building, in which the SRC is based, had been built in 1890 to house the then newly formed GUU. In 1932, the GUU obtained its own building at the foot of University Avenue and the McIntyre Building became home to the Queen Margaret Union. At this time, the SRC was housed in rooms in Pearce Lodge, the former gatehouse of the University's old site on the High Street which had been reassembled at Gilmorehill. However, it moved into the John McIntyre Building when new premises were built for the QM in 1969. The dedication refers to John McIntyre, a physician who donated five thousand pounds (equal to around ¬£300,000 in 2010http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/results.asp#mid) for its construction, in memory of his wife Anne. The John McIntyre building has since been renamed simply the McIntyre building. ===Notable former officers=== *Jamie Hepburn, Member of the Scottish Parliament (Senior Vice-President) *Angela Constance, Member of the Scottish Parliament (President, 1991‚Äì92) *Alasdair Allan, Member of the Scottish Parliament (Senior Vice-President, 1991‚Äì92) *Ron Donachie, actor (President, 1976-1977) (as Ronald Porter) *John Lamberton Bell, minister and hymn-writer, Rector of the University (President, 1974‚Äì75) *Donald Dewar, First Minister of Scotland (Honorary Secretary, 1959‚Äì60) *Sir William Kerr Fraser, civil servant, Chancellor of the University (President, 1951‚Äì52) *Robert Gibson, Lord Gibson, Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Scottish Land Court (President, 1910‚Äì11) *Sir Robert Horne, Chancellor of the Exchequer (President, 1892‚Äì93) *Liam Fox, Member of Parliament (General Representative, 1981-82) *John Nicolson, Member of Parliament (General Representative, 1982-83) *Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland (General Representative) == Representation == The SRC comprises 47 representatives, four of whom are general representatives and two of whom are first-year representatives.

The four sabbatical officers are also accorded membership of the Senate, while the President and a Court Assessor (elected by the Council) are entitled to sit on the University Court. The Council also elects representatives to numerous university committees, including the Health, Safety & Well-being Committee, the Library Committee and the Academic Dress Committee. The SRC is also home to the Rector of the University, elected by the students to represent them. This is achieved primarily through the Rector's role as chair of the University Court. The position of Rector is currently vacant, with the scheduled March 2020 Rectorial election being postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The most recent Rector was human rights Lawyer Aamer Anwar, whose term ended on the 31st of March 2020. Glasgow University SRC is represented at a national level by the Coalition of Higher Education Students in Scotland (CHESS), the National Postgraduate Committee (NPC), and the Aldwych Group. == Services == The SRC provides the following non-representative services to students at the University: * Advice Centre - free and confidential advice * GU Volunteering - opportunities for students * Jobshop - a job vacancies service * Secondhand Bookshop - students can buy and sell course texts * Nightline - an anonymous, confidential telephone support and information service * Photocopying - photocopying service available for students at the University Until 2004 the SRC ran a shop selling stationery, newspapers, snacks and University merchandise. It was housed in the \\"HUB\\" building beside the University library, now refurbished as the Fraser Building. == Media == The SRC also partly funds and houses four student media groups. They retain editorial independence from the SRC whilst benefiting from its support. Many of those involved in the SRC's student media have won awards for their work and gone on to find a career in the media. These groups are: * Glasgow University Guardian - fortnightly newspaper * Glasgow University Magazine (GUM) - termly magazine * Glasgow University Student Television (GUST) - broadcast online and via screens around campus * Subcity Radio - internet radio station The SRC previously referred to the media as \\"publications\\" and until 2004 the SRC website glasgowstudent.net was run as a fifth media group. There are other student run media groups at the University, housed within the unions, including G-YOU, published by the Glasgow University Union, and qmunicate, published by the Queen Margaret Union. ==References== * Archives relating to the Glasgow University Students' Representative Council are maintained by the Archives of the University of Glasgow. == External links == * Glasgow University SRC * CHESS * NPC Category:1886 establishments in Scotland Category:19th century in Scotland Students' Representative Council Category:Students' unions in Scotland ","title":"Glasgow University Students' Representative Council"},{"id":"1428218","text":"Casting call for black cats, Los Angeles, 1961. The studio was seeking cats for the Roger Corman film Tales of Terror. In the performing arts industry such as theatre, film, or television, a casting (or casting call) is a pre- production process for selecting a certain type of actor, dancer, singer, or extra for a particular role or part in a script, screenplay, or teleplay. This process is typically utilized for a motion picture, television program, documentary, music video, play, or television advertisement, etc. This involvement in a dramatic production, advertisement, and or industrial video is intended for an audience, or studio audience. ==Cast types== Actors are selected to play various types of roles. Main cast or starring roles consist of several actors whose appearances are significant in film, theatre, or television. The largest role who plays protagonist is called a leading actor (or leading actress for a woman). When there is no a single leading actor, the main roles are called ensemble cast which comprises multiple principal actors and performers who are typically assigned roughly equal amounts of screen time. A supporting actor is an actor who performs a role in a play or film below that of the leading actor(s). Supporting roles are above that of a bit part which is direct interaction with the principal actors and no more than five lines of dialogue, often referred to as a five-or-less or under-five in the United States, or under sixes in British television. When a well-known actor or other celebrity appears in a bit part, it is called cameo appearance. ==Casting process== The casting process involves a series of auditions before a casting panel, composed of individuals within a theatrical production such as theatrical producer, and theater director. However, within a given television production a casting panel can consist of a television producer, or within film production a casting panel could contain a film producer, film director, and/or choreographer. Usually, in nearly all areas of show business, a casting director is on this panel as well. In the early stages of this process performers often may present, or are presented with prepared audition pieces such as monologues, songs, choreography, scripts and or sides. These audition pieces are usually video taped, typically in the form of screen tests and then attached with resumes, as well as head shots and or viewed online via websites such as IMDb, then shared with film producers, film directors and or studio executives. Later stages may involve groups of actors both union, (SAG- AFTRA) and non union depending on the size and scope of the production, attempting to read material from the work under consideration, paired off in various combinations of two, three or more. With each of the actor's overall motivational choices evaluated, the casting panel considers both the individual actor, and the chemistry created from either one of the combinations set forth within the read-through, such as boy meets girl, etc. Within the production of a prestigious work under consideration for film or television, and depending on the difficulty in finding a lead or supporting actor for the role, such as with the casting of the biopic films Notorious, Straight Outta Compton and All Eyez on Me, casting calls may go out into the general public at large, this is referred to as a Cattle Call (typical for community theater), to professional and semi-professional local actors where a similar process is followed (for supporting roles in theater and film) or for specifically selected actors (for leading roles, especially in films). Casting character breakdowns, not to be confused with script breakdowns, are often provided by production agents who submit their clients to casting, which provides a brief summary of character (age, gender, race or ethnicity, situations they may be involved in). A more robust version of this painstaking task can be made through the Breakdown Services, which was founded by former actor Gary Marsh over 40 years ago. This was due to the difficult logistics issues for agents to get their actors submitted for acting roles from major film studios and casting directors. This casting breakdown service provides a complete character breakdown of various scripts and projects from production companies for film, television, modeling, commercials etc., to only agencies and managers who meet certain criteria. These agents and managers are positioned all over the world, and subscribe to this service that literally has an entire suite of services for just about every aspect of the breakdown, for a monthly service subscription fee. This suite includes services such as Breakdown Express, which offer representatives, casting and those who subscribe, a quicker way to post projects themselves. Another more limited version of the breakdown service, also for a monthly subscription fee is called Actors Access where acting can subscribe to what is only made available to them, more like an entry-level acting position, like under-five, or a bit part, a great tool for the actor whom is without an agent or manager. An actor may go through several casting calls before receiving a part, and even though well known actors or actresses oftentimes still go through this very necessary process, some are privileged enough to have well known writers, screenwriters and or directors /producers pitch a project for their intent to be cast in a role. The well known actor or actress oftentimes negotiates producer credit as well as very lucrative monetary compensation. Independent casting studios like Film Independent who hosts the annual Independent Spirit Awards and the Los Angeles Film Festival are often utilized for casting calls so that auditions can take place in one location, as well as possible affiliated various locations saving valuable time, energy and money. ===Casting directors=== For some major productions, the process of selecting actors for sometimes hundreds of speaking parts and roles, may often require a specialized staff. While the last word remains with the people in charge such as the director, producer, artistic departments and overall production team, a casting director or \\"CD\\" (and sometimes the casting associate) is in charge of most of the daily work involved in this process during pre-production. A casting director is sometimes assisted by a casting associate; productions with large numbers of extras may have their own extras casting director as well, however in all aspects of a film or television production's budget, they are all a part of the above-the-line, answering to the director as part of his or her staff. The \\"CD\\" remains as a liaison between director, actors and their agents/managers and the studio/network to get the characters in the script cast. Some casting directors build an impressive career working on numerous Hollywood productions such as Marion Dougherty, Mary Jo Slater, Mary Selway, Lynn Stalmaster, April Webster, Tammara Billik, Marci Liroff, Avy Kaufman, Mindy Marin, and Robi Reed. At least in the early stages of casting and or extras casting, the process may be decentralized geographically, often in conjunction with actual shooting planned in different locations. Another reason may be tapping into each home market in the case of an international co-production. However, for the top parts, the choice of one or more beautiful people, whose presence is of enormous commercial importance, may rather follow strictly personal channels, e.g. direct contact with the director. During this time known as the \\"attachment phase\\" of a film, the casting director's job is to send out copies of the current script to agents for what is known as coverage. Coverage is when a script yet to be cast is read, summarized into a one-pager, and a brief set of character descriptions established. At this time, if an agency agrees to give coverage to a film, they will submit a list of ideas to the casting directors of actors available, capable, and in the price range of the film. Also, casting directors create their own idea lists and can \\"check avails\\" or call the actor representation to see if they are available and interested in taking on potential projects. If an idea that is generated from a casting director and a subsequent avail check or from an agent's recommendation is \\"approved\\" by the director, producers, and financiers (or studio), the casting director sends out what is called an \\"Offer.\\" The offer, usually contains a letter to the actor's representative explaining the role in question, a copy of the script, why the actor has been selected, the length of time commitment, the approximate start date of filming, the filming location, and the proposed salary offering. If the actor does not respond to the material or for whatever reason cannot accept the job, they respond to casting with what is called a \\"pass.\\" If they accept the offer, the agent engages the casting director and a deal memo is sent from casting to the representative. It is at this time when negotiations between agency and production happen to finalize any deal points before the entertainment lawyers step in and draw up the attachment contracts. If this process happens very early on in the development of a movie but the official shoot dates and details are not yet known, a Letter of Intent or \\"LOI\\" is drafted, to indicate, if and when the project is \\"green lit\\" or begins active production, the actor is already hired to portray that particular role. After the attachment phase is complete (which depends on many factors‚Äîincluding but not limited to: financial backers, studio heads, availability of other above the line personnel), the physical auditions begin for all of the remaining roles. During this time, depending on the budget of the film, they could have what is called \\"pre-screens\\" where you audition only for a casting director (or associate) to see if the actor is right for the material. After pre-screens would be a \\"director session\\", during this time the actor comes in and auditions (usually with the same material) and now performs for the casting director and the film director. If there is a next step, it is usually a \\"callback\\" or producer session, where anyone who has decision making power is in the room for your audition. In television, this phase is referred to as a \\"screen test\\" and Network Executives would also be in attendance. Once actors are selected from the pool of available actors, the same booking process that happens in the attachment phase takes place for any actor except extras. The resulting list of actors who were selected to play a character for a production, is called a cast list, which is incorporated into a production company's daily call sheet, and reflected in the projects title sequence especially with film and television. === Casting office personnel === Readers: This person reads all other character's lines opposite the actor who is currently auditioning. A good reader is someone who has acting skills, but who has no interest in booking a role through that casting director's office at that time. A reader will know how to give and take and play with other actors without ever outshining the auditioning actors. Interns: Interns are more common to commercial casting offices which host as many as a dozen different casting directors holding different auditions per day. While some commercial casting offices hold permanent casting space, many rent out studios on a project to project basis. A key intern will work with many busy casting directors sorting mail, copying sides and transcribing them onto \\"cue cards\\" or large boards to be read off of as prompts in the casting room, help actors sign in, and keep the flow of actors going in and out of the casting room as smooth as possible. Casting Assistants: This is the entry-level position in the field of casting. These people go above and beyond the call of duty of your typical office assistant. They do everything from covering phones, to making copies, setting up audition (aka \\"session\\") equipment like lights, the camera, sound equipment, etc. They sometimes can be found in the office relaying audition appointments, checking actors avails, or in the casting room making sure the recording software is running smoothly so the Casting Director can focus on each actor's performance. Casting Associates: Associates is the second chain of command in a casting office. Once a casting associate has worked for two years in the field of casting, they can apply for membership in Casting Society of America. Typically, the work under a Casting Director running pre-read sessions, prepping deal memos, and doing any calls to agents. Many associates begin to take on smaller scale projects so they can amass enough credits to move up in rank in CSA to a full-fledged Casting Director. Casting Director: Their job is to know a lot about a lot of actors, so that they can advise and present to the director the best of the existing possibilities. Casting directors are highly influential and is usually on the project because the director trusts their judgements. They are also the ones who decides who the director does see. Good casting directors \\"discover\\" actor by carefully setting it up so that the director and producer will feel as if they've made the discovery of the new actor. On the occasion when the director or producer does not respond to the actor presented, they must keep in mind that they aren't directing the production, the director is the one who's going to have to work with that actor‚Äîtherefore, it is casting's responsibility to delicately balance between showcasing the actor available to them and the director and producer's sensibilities, tastes, and expectations. ===Casting Society of America (CSA)=== The significant organization of professional screen, television, reality, and theater casting in the US is the Casting Society of America (CSA), but membership is optional. Casting directors organized in 2005 and became members of a collective bargaining unit, the Hollywood Teamsters Local 399 and New York Teamsters Local 817. === Casting director workshops === A common practice of many casting directors and casting associates have been casting director workshops. The types of workshop practices vary, but typically aspiring actors pay to perform in front of a casting professional who gives back feedback on the performance. Actors and industry professionals against workshops argue that casting directors are paid to find talent, not have talent pay to be seen by them. Supporters of the workshops argue that the workshops have classroom like settings and are a good source of feedback and networking.https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/casting-directors- gatekeepers-success-635/ Because of their mixed reception, casting director workshops have not been met without controversy. Former Criminal Minds casting director Scott David was fired after The Hollywood Reporter published a story about his casting director workshops.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/criminal-minds-casting- director-hollywood-880495 In February 2017, five casting director workshops were charged with criminal charges for charging actors to audition for projects.https://deadline.com/2017/02/hollywood-casting-workshop-scams-city- attorney-1201907052/ In January 2018, Lindsay Chag, the casting director of films like Robin Hood: Men in Tights and Dracula: Dead and Loving It, was convicted guilty of violating the Talent Scam Prevention Act for her role in casting director workshops.https://deadline.com/2018/01/casting-director- scandal-lindsay-chag-guilty-talent-scam-prevention-act-1202275794/ ===Awards=== ==== United States ==== The highest honor a casting director can receive in the United States is the Artios Award, awarded by their peers in the Casting Society of America. Artios comes from the Greek word meaning \\"perfectly fitted.\\" The Artios award excellence in casting for all genres of casting except commercials. The Artios are currently held mid-January annually with ceremonies in New York, Los Angeles, and (beginning in 2018) London. Since their incarnation in 1985, they were held in November but were moved in the 2013‚Äì2014 season to align with the rest of the film and television industry's awards season. The Artios is awarded to those CSA members who receive primary screen (or program) credit for casting on the winning project. Location Casting Directors, Casting Executives and Department Heads who are CSA members and who receive credit on winning projects also receive an Artios Award. CSA Associates on those projects are recognized in the press and with a certificate. The Emmy Awards has a category for casting directors. As of 2017, Junie Lowry-Johnson has won the most casting Emmys as an individual, all in the drama category. She has six awards for her work on NYPD Blue, Six Feet Under, True Blood and Homeland. The only shows to win casting Emmys three times were 30 Rock and Veep, both in the comedy category. In 2017, at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences introduced the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for a Reality Program. ==== United Kingdom ==== In 2020, the British Academy Film Awards introduced the BAFTA Award for Best Casting. ====Canada==== The national Canadian Screen Awards present an annual award for casting in television, but do not currently present an award for casting in film. The Prix Iris, the regional Canadian film awards for Quebec, introduced the Prix Iris for Best Casting in 2017. ==See also== * Audition website * Backstage (a casting publication) * Casting By * Casting couch * Character actor * Dramatis personae * Ensemble cast * Extra (actor) * Fach, the German opera casting system * Stock character * Stunt casting * Stunt coordinator ==References== ==External links== * CastingSociety.com: The Casting Society of America (CSA), the largest professional association of * \\"casting\\", the Internet Movie Database Glossary * The Casting Directors' Guild (UK & Ireland) Category:Performing arts Category:Theatre Category:Television terminology ","title":"Casting (performing arts)"},{"id":"1428238","text":"Marvin E. Pratt (born May 26, 1944) is an American politician who served as acting mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 2004 and as interim Milwaukee County Executive in 2011. He was the first African-American to serve as mayor of Milwaukee. ==Early life== Pratt was born on May 26th, 1944 to Leon Pratt, Sr., a United States Naval officer, and Mildred Joyce Pratt in Dallas, Texas. While living in Dallas, he attended a local Catholic school with his twin sister, Marielle, until his family moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1959, following the death of his father in a car accident in 1949. He has two sisters, Gwen and Reba, and a brother, Leon Jr.. Pratt graduated from North Division High School in 1962 and immediately joined the United States Air Force. He was stationed in the Libyan desertduring the Vietnam War and was honorably discharged in the mid 60s. When he returned to Milwaukee after his service, he enrolled in Marquette University and gained a degree in political science in 1972. Pratt became an intern for mayor Henry Maier and began climbing a ladder of local government jobs. ==Political life== Pratt ran for an aldermanic seat in 1984, a tense time for race relations in the city. During this year, there was a racial divide over whether or not to rename what was then known as North 3rd Street to Dr. Martin Luther King Drive. Despite his loss to Roy B. Nabors in 1984, he ran for the same seat and won in a 1986 special election. Upon his election in 1986, Pratt was appointed to the Finance and Personnel Committee, where he continuously served as member and eventually chairman from 1996 to 2000. One of his notable victories while serving on the Common Council was the creation of the Resident's Preference Program in 1991, which is described on the official website of the City of Milwaukee website as, \\"The RPP certification is designed to promote the use of city residents as part of a contractor‚Äôs or developer's workforce on certain city-funded construction and private development projects. Contractors bidding on public works projects and development projects financed with public tax dollars must hire a percentage of RPP-certified City of Milwaukee residents to work on these projects.\\"This program is still in effect today, and has been expanded to include private businesses. In 2000, Pratt was elected the president of the Common Council, \\"...he was motivated to run after seeing so many vacant boarded up houses never changing in Milwaukee neighborhoods. The city was divided and the city workforce and federal departments didn't represent Milwaukee's population.\\". When mayor John Norquist stepped down in 2004 three months before his term expired, Pratt became acting mayor. He was the first African-American to serve as mayor of Milwaukee. Pratt ran in a primary election for the Mayoral seat and finished first from a field of thirteen candidates during the primary. He lost his bid to retain the job to Tom Barrett in the 2004 general election.Masse, Ryan. \\"Milwaukee mayor race reveals city's racial divide\\" Badger Herald April 19, 2004; updated January 12, 2007 On February 4, 2011, Pratt was sworn in as interim Milwaukee County Executive. Appointed by County Board Chairman Lee Holloway, he filled the unexpired term of former Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker, who was elected governor of Wisconsin, until the special Spring Election held on April 5, 2011. Upon swearing in, Pratt became the first person to serve as both Milwaukee Mayor and Milwaukee County Executive. On April 5, 2011, Chris Abele defeated Republican challenger Jeff Stone, capturing over 61% of the vote and succeeded Pratt to serve out the remainder of then-County Executive Scott Walker's original term.Schultze, Steve (2011-04-06). Abele defeats Stone for Milwaukee County executive. Journal Sentinel, 6 April 2011.

They have five grandchildren. Pratt was a major in the United States Army Reserves. In October 2015, the Milwaukee Public School Board passed a resolution to rename Silver Spring Elementary after Pratt. In 2016, the school was officially renamed Marvin E.

For women, fertility medication is used to stimulate follicle development of the ovary. There are very few fertility medication options available for men. Agents that enhance ovarian activity can be classified as either gonadotropin releasing hormone, estrogen antagonists or gonadotropins. Treatment decision-making involves four major factors: efficacy, burden of treatment (such as frequency of injections and office visits), safety, and financial costs. ==Female== ===Main techniques=== The main techniques involving fertility medication in females are: *Ovulation induction, with the aim of producing one or two ovulatory follicles for fertilization by sexual intercourse or artificial insemination *Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, which is generally part of in vitro fertilization, and the aim is generally to develop multiple follicles (optimally between 11 and 14 antral follicles measuring 2‚Äì8 mm in diameter), followed by transvaginal oocyte retrieval, co-incubation, followed by embryo transfer of a maximum of two embryos at a time. *Final maturation induction of follicles, also triggering a predictable time of ovulation. ===Gonadotropin-releasing hormone=== Either gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or any gonadotropin- releasing hormone agonist (such as Lupron) may be used in combination with luteinizing hormone (LH) using an infusion pump to simulate endogenous hormone production. GnRH stimulates the release of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) from the anterior pituitary in the body. This set of therapy is reserved for a subset of women with infertility and have produced ovulation rates of 90% and pregnancy rates of 80% or higher. ===Antiestrogens=== Antiestrogens inhibit the effects of estrogen, which include selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) and aromatase inhibitors. Hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis in females, with estrogen exerting mainly negative feedback on FSH secretion from the pituitary gland. ====Selective estrogen receptor modulators==== Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). It is the most widely used fertility drug. Other medications in this class include tamoxifen and raloxifene, although both are not as effective as clomiphene and are thus less widely used for fertility purposes. They are used in ovulation induction by inhibiting the negative feedback of estrogen at the hypothalamus. As the negative feedback of estrogen is inhibited, the hypothalamus secretes GnRh which in turn stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete LH and FSH which help in ovulation. Between 60 and 85% of women, mostly with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), ovulate successfully in response to clomiphene with a cumulative pregnancy rate of 30 to 40%. ====Aromatase inhibitors ==== Although primarily a breast cancer treatment, aromatase inhibitors (generic Letrozole) are also used in ovulation induction. Aromatase inhibitors are a common fertility treatment to treat women with PCOS. A meta-analysis analyzing live birth rates for women with PCOS treated with clomiphene compared to letrozole found that letrozole resulted in higher live birth rates. However, ovulation induction remains an off-label indication which affects use. ===Gonadotropins=== Gonadotropins are protein hormones that stimulate the gonads (testes and ovaries). For medication, they can be extracted from urine in postmenopausal women or through genetic modification and bacterial recombination. Examples of recombinant FSH are Follistim and Gonal F, while Luveris is a recombinant LH. FSH and recombinant FSH analogues are mainly used for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation as well as ovulation induction. There has been some controversy over the efficacy between extracted and recombinant FSH for ovulation induction; however, a meta-analysis of 14 trials among 1726 women found that there were no differences in clinical pregnancy or live birth outcomes. Chemotherapy treatment in premenopausal women can compromise ovarian reserve and function, with gonadotoxic effects ranging from temporary to permanent infertility and premature ovarian failure (POF). Proposed mechanisms for chemotherapy-induced ovarian damage include apoptosis of growing follicles, fibrosis of stromal cells, and injury to blood vessels resulting in ischemia. First-line options for fertility preservation include embryo and oocyte preservation before starting chemotherapy, though these methods do not contribute to the preservation of gonadal function. GnRH agonist therapies have been associated with relatively low risk, time, and cost. There is evidence that chemotherapy cotreatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) can increase the probability of spontaneous menses and ovulation resumption. However, this cotreatment has not shown an improvement in pregnancy rates. ===Human chorionic gonadotropin=== Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), also known as the ‚Äúhormone of pregnancy‚Äù is a hormone that is normally produced during pregnancy and plays an integral role throughout reproduction. It is crucial in maintaining pregnancy, from the stages of placentation through to early embryo development. It is also used in assisted reproductive techniques as it can be used to replace LH in final maturation induction. === Other Medications === Although metformin has been used off- label to treat oligomenorrhea and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in women with PCOS, metformin is no longer recommended as infertility treatment per the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) in 2017. Its use to treat anovulatory infertility was based on an association of insulin resistance in non-obese women with PCOS. While metformin may increase ovulation in women with PCOS, there is no evidence of increased pregnancy rates or live-birth rates, and the combination therapy of metformin and clomiphene citrate did not provide a significant benefit compared to clomiphene citrate alone. First-line therapy for ovulation induction in women with PCOS remains the anti-estrogen clomiphene citrate or the aromatase inhibitor letrozole. ==Male== Testosterone therapy (TTh), which aims to restore testosterone levels to mid-normal ranges in men diagnosed with late- onset hypogonadism (LOH), is an approved treatment. Treatment for oligospermia is centered around underlying causes, such as endocrine and systematic disorders that can cause hypogonadism. Typically, other assisted reproductive technologies are used. Although there is no FDA indication for use of aromatase inhibitors improving spermatogenesis, testolactone has been shown to be effective when compared to placebo. Though there is no FDA indication for the use of clomiphene in male infertility, it has been prescribed since the 1960s. As of 2013, there is not substantial evidence to suggest that clomiphene can treat male infertility. Combinations of vitamins and minerals, including selenium, co-enzyme Q10, L-carnitine, folic acid, zinc, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to improve male infertility, but due to the low amounts of studies and participants, more clinical studies are needed. Folate in combination with zinc supplementation was shown to have a statistically significant effect on sperm concentration and morphology when compared to placebo. There is evidence suggesting a significant association between vitamin D serum concentrations and the quality of sperm in men, characterized by the sperm's motility and progress motility. Because the quality of men's sperm is influenced by genetics, results should be interpreted cautiously. There is little evidence that supplementation with antioxidants, such as pentoxifylline will increase male fertility. As of September 2017, mesenchymal stem cell therapy for infertility has been studied in animals, but has not entered clinical trials. Stem cells collected from bone marrow and umbilical cord have shown the most ability to rehabilitate fertility in animals, but more studies are needed to determine efficacy. ==Adverse effects== === Cancer === Since infertility increases the risk of ovarian cancer, fertility drugs have been used to combat this but the cancer risks are still not completely known. As of 2019, there have been studies that have shown the risk of developing ovarian cancer is higher when taking fertility medications however due to the low number of studies, lack of follow-up time and other contribution factors, the risk is unclear. Most studies conducted have shown that fertility drugs do not increase the risk of other gynecologic cancers (cervical and endometrial) or other malignant cancers (thyroid, colon, melanoma, breast). The validity of these data may be affected by patient-reported biases, small subject numbers, and other confounding variables. === Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome === Estrogen antagonists and gonadotropins may stimulate multiple follicles and other ovarian hormones leading to multiple birth and possible ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Development of OHSS is dependent on the administration of hCG and is mediated through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). OHSS is characterized as cystic enlargement of the ovaries. Multiple birth is especially deleterious due to compounding risks including premature delivery and low birthweight, pre-eclampisa, and increased risk of neonatal mortality. While triplet births have been declining in ART, multiple births remain over 50% of births from IVF.

His father was a fisherman. His parents immigrated to the United States in 1909. He was raised on Manhattan's West Side where his father owned a fish shop on 41st Street and 9th Avenue. ==Professional career== ===Name=== Corrara was given his ring name in 1910 by his former manager, Scotty Montieth, of Dundee, Scotland. Corrara retained the name for 22 years, even when he fought under new manager, Jimmy Johnston. Sports writer, and cartoonist, Hype Igoe, also bestowed the lasting moniker, \\"The Little Bar of Iron,\\" on Corrara, in homage to his durability. ===Early career=== Dundee fought his first fight at Sharkey Athletic Club, on 65th Street and Broadway. He fought under the name \\"Young Marino.\\" His opponent was \\"Skinny Bob.\\" In 1913, Dundee earned a world title fight in his 87th fight. He fought 20 rounds against World Featherweight champion, Johnny Kilbane in Vernon, California. The fight ended in a draw. Dundee would not be afforded an opportunity to fight for the 126-pound featherweight title again for another 10 years. ===Junior Lightweight and Featherweight champion=== Johnny Dundee y Benny Leonard en 1923. Dundee's loss (in a 15-round decision) to Joe Welling was the first bout to be held after New York enacted the Walker Law, which renewed legal professional boxing, set a 15 round maximum for fights, and created the various weight classes for bouts. Welling Beats Dundee to Open Gotham Boxing\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, September 18, 1920, p12 In 1921, Dundee won the junior lightweight championship when his opponent, George \\"KO\\" Chaney, was disqualified in the fifth round. The win made Dundee the first universally recognized junior lightweight champion in history. A year later, Dundee knocked out Danny Frush. Following the win, he was recognized, in New York State, as the featherweight champion of the world. On July 6, 1922, Dundee defeated \\"Little\\" Jackie Sharkey by unanimous decision in a fifteen-round Junior Lightweight title bout at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. Sharkey was briefly down in the fourth round, and again in the fifteenth. Though the fight was close Dundee won \\"by a shade\\".\\"Buff Makes Sharkey Go Limit to Win By Shade\\", Reading Times, Reading, Pennsylvania, pg. 15, 17 January 1920 He was criticized for the fight with the New York Evening World writing that Dundee was \\"losing his fighting fire\\" by allowing the bout to go fifteen rounds.Van Every, Ed, \\"Dundee Scores Easy Victory Over Sharkey\\", New York Evening World, New York, New York, pg. 14, 7 July 1922 Dundee successfully defended his junior lightweight crown three times before losing it to Jack Bernstein on May 30, 1923. They fought at the Coney Island Velodrome, in front of a crowd of 15,000. Dundee was expected to win; however, he lost a unanimous fifteen round decision despite knocking Bernstein down in the third round knockdown. Less than two months later, Dundee was given the opportunity to fight featherweight champion, and war hero, Eugene Criqui. He lost 28 pounds in four weeks in order to fight him, making 126 pounds on the days of the fight. Criqui had beaten Johnny Kilbane two days after Dundee's fight with Bernstein, with a sixth round knockout. However, part of the contract for this fight required that he give Dundee a shot at the title within sixty days. Fifty-four days later, on July 26, 1923, Dundee fought Criqui. He knocked him down four times and beat him by a fifteen-round decision. ====Controversial decision==== On December 17, 1923, Dundee fought Jack Bernstein again at Madison Square Garden. The fight ended in a Split Decision. Several newspapers, including the New York Times, wrote that the judges made the wrong decision. Author Ken Blady wrote that several of the judges may have been influenced to vote against Bernstein. The Milwaukee Sentinel echoed by printing \\"By probably the worst decision in local boxing history, Johnny Dundee of Jersey City regained his Junior Lightweight championship from Jack Bernstein.\\"The Jewish Boxer's Hall of Fame, Blady, Ken, (1988) Shapolsky Publishers, Inc., New York, NY, pg.137\\"Dundee is Champ Again, Wins Over Jack Bernstein\\", The Milwaukee Sentinel, pg. 25, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 18 December 1923.\\"Dundee Again Champ of 130-Pound Boxers\\", The Milwaukee Journal, pg. 14, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 18 December 1923. In contrast, the Milwaukee Journal noted that Dundee finished strong in the bout, and agreed with the decision. The paper also noted \\"the sentiment of the crowd, based on the fighters' round by round showing, was that Bernstein had won easily.\\" With the win, Dundee had unified the featherweight title and the junior lightweight title. ===Later career=== Less than a year after unifying the title, Dundee lost the junior lightweight title to Steve \\"Kid\\" Sullivan on June 20, 1924. He then relinquished the featherweight crown, on August 10, 1924, at his manager's urging because he had outgrown (in weight) the 126 pound weight limit. The last significant fight of his career was in 1927 when he challenged featherweight champion Tony Canzoneri, but lost a 15-round decision. After a three year retirement, Dundee tried to stage a comeback in 1932. However, two fights into it, he officially retired after posting a six- round decision win over Mickey Greb, and a 10th round lost to Al Dunbar. ===Style=== In 1965, Al del Greco wrote that Dundee was regarded as a \\"good southpaw craftsman.\\" Local New York boxing legend, Johnny Martin, said of Dundee: ===Record=== Dundee fought 321 fights. He won 35 percent of his fights, 6 percent ended in knock outs, 10 percent were losses and five percent were draws. Fifty percent (159) were No Decisions. In 1957, Dundee was voted into the Boxing Hall of Fame. ==Personal life== Dundee married a woman named, Lucille, on June 26, 1912. They lived at 301 W. 40th Street and had a daughter, also named Lucille, born in 1913. After beating Frankie Callahan over 10 rounds, on March 16, 1915, the next day, Dundee filed a petition to divorce Lucille, claiming she \\"beat him up\\": Several days later, his wife countersued on the grounds of his \\"uncontrollable temper.\\" His wife claimed he knocked her unconscious six months into their marriage, and would often hit himself in the head with a pair of shoes, to the point of drawing blood. She also claimed he was a philanderer, and that when he left her he gave her a \\"farewell beating.\\" ==Death== On April 9, 1965, Dundee was admitted to East Orange General Hospital in New Jersey. He died thirteen days later of a respiratory infection complicated by pneumonia. Dundee, who had become a successful businessman after boxing, left an estate valued at $300,000 ($2.4 million in 2018). ==Legacy== Dundee faced many great fighters in the featherweight, junior-lightweight, and lightweight divisions of his era including Benny Leonard (nine times), Lew Tendler (three times), and lightweight champions Freddie Welsh and Willie Ritchie. Dundee was knocked out only twice in his career ‚Äì in 1917, he was knocked out in the first round by Willie Jackson in Philadelphia, and in 1929, he was knocked out in Montreal by Al Foreman in the 10th round. Dundee was regarded as a skillful boxer with great footwork. Though he had little knockout power, he was widely regarded as being highly skilled at fighting off the ropes. Statistical boxing website BoxRec lists Dundee as the #3 ranked featherweight of all time, while The Ring Magazine founder Nat Fleischer placed him at #4. The International Boxing Research Organization rates Dundee as the 5th best featherweight boxer ever and boxing historian Bert Sugar placed him 32nd in his Top 100 Fighters catalogue.All-Time Featherweight Rankings IBROresearch.com Retrieved on 2014-04-29 During his career he had 331 bouts. Only two fighters in history, Len Wickwar (463) and Jack Britton (350), had more fights. Dundee was known to be highly regarded among the boxing community and his peers: Dundee was elected to the Ring Magazine Hall of Fame in 1957 and the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1991.Cyber Boxing Encyclopedia - Johnny Dundee CyberBoxingZone.com Retrieved on 2014-04-30 == Notable bouts ==  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" colspan=\\"7\\" - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#e3e3e3;\\"  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Result  style=\\"border- style:none none solid solid; \\"Opponent  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Type  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Rd., Time  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Date  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Location  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"NotesJohnny Dundee's Professional Boxing Record.

His first important work (1882) was a statue of Miles Morgan, the Puritan, for Springfield, Massachusetts. Among his other works are the Daguerre Memorial in Washington; Thomas K. Beecher, Elmira, New York, and Alfred the Great, Appellate Division Courthouse of New York State. He devoted himself particularly to the making of portrait busts, in which he attained high rank. In 1881 he became a member of the National Academy of Design. He sculpted three of the nine busts around the front of the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress in Washington, DC. His Nathaniel Hawthorne, often mistaken for Mark Twain, has pride of place in the ornate west front gallery of the original Library of Congress building, finished in 1897. He also sculpted the Washington Irving and the Ralph Waldo Emerson. The Emerson bust is an exact likeness, as Hartley, and especially his supervisor, Ainsworth Rand Spofford, knew how prominent Emerson's nose actually was. ==Gallery== File:Daguerre After Dark (Washington, DC).jpg File:Bust of Nathaniel Hawthorne by Jonathan Scott Hartley.jpg == Further reading == *Durante, Dianne, Outdoor Monuments of Manhattan: A Historical Guide (New York University Press, 2007), Essay 2. == References == * == External links == Category:1845 births Category:1912 deaths Category:Artists from Albany, New York Category:20th-century American sculptors Category:19th-century American sculptors Category:American male sculptors Category:Sculptors from New York (state) ","title":"Jonathan Scott Hartley"},{"id":"1428247","text":"Ardoyne area as viewed from Oldpark Road Ardoyne () is a working class and mainly Catholic and Irish republican district in north Belfast, Northern Ireland. It gained notoriety due to the large number of incidents during The Troubles. ==Foundation== The village of Ardoyne was founded in 1815 when businessman Michael Andrews moved his Damask factory from Little York Street. In addition to the factory he built a large house for himself and thirty houses for employees to live in. More mills were built around the growing village and by 1850 there were three additional mills in the area, providing jobs and houses for a growing population. The house in which Andrews lived in is no longer there. It is now the site of the Crumlin Star Social Club, located in Balholme Drive at the top of Ardoyne. ==The Troubles== ==Crumlin Road== Holy Cross Church, Crumlin Road. The main Roman Catholic place of worship for Ardoyne Ardoyne is bordered on the west by the Crumlin Road, an area which has for the most part a majority Protestant population and forms an interface area. For many years, on the Twelfth and during the rest of the marching season parades held by the Orange Order have led to conflict between the two communities. Controversy has been sparked by the differing attitudes of the two communities to the marches, with the Orange Order and their supporters arguing that they are following traditional parade routes, whilst their nationalist critics argue that the marches are triumphalist and not wanted in their area.Cracks in the Orange Order BBC News, 15 July 2008Loyalist parade sparks riots in Catholic area The Guardian, 13 July 2004 Crumlin Road roundabout, with the Ardoyne shops on the left of the picture For the most part the Parades Commission has given permission for the Twelfth marches to go past the flashpoint Ardoyne shops, close to the Crumlin Road roundabout which also leads on to the Woodvale Road.Parade Will Pass Ardoyne Flashpoint One particular cause of conflict was that, in the past, marchers had carried flags associated with the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association (paramilitary Loyalist organisations), and played loyalist songs. In 2010, however, the Shankill Star flute band was banned from carrying a controversial banner depicting UVF member Brian Robinson. Since there are only two exits from the estate, residents on the opposite side of the Crumlin Road (Mountainview) are barricaded into their street by the police and Army for several hours throughout the day: in the morning when the march goes by; and in the evening when it returns. Local residents believe this to be a breach of their human rights. The Police Ombudsman concurs with this assessment but is of the opinion that the barriers are necessary for security reasons. Unionists have highlighted the part republican organisations have played in protests including prominent convicted IRA men such as Sean Kelly who was arrested after violent protests during a parade. Despite the local community group, the Ardoyne Parades Dialogue Group, and representatives of the march, the North and West Belfast Parades Forum, reaching an accommodation which imposed conditions on the march, golf balls and stones were thrown by protesters being kept back by stewards. Riots that broke out following the 2010 marches were blamed by Sinn F√©in's Gerry Kelly on Real IRA members orchestrating tension in the area. ==Holy Cross dispute== The Holy Cross Girls' School, a Catholic primary school which serves the Ardoyne area but is located in the neighbouring loyalist Upper Ardoyne/Glenbryn area was the sign of tension of 2001 to 2003. Loyalists made claims about harassment by republicans and regarding the use of the school run as a cover for IRA intelligence gathering missions, leading to crowds of protesters blocking the access of pupils to the school.Holy Cross school, Belfast: two years on, Beatrix Campbell, The Guardian, 1 December 2003, retrieved 4 August 2009 The protests, which included violence directed by loyalist protesters at parents and children alike, were widely covered by the world's media and during the autumn of 2001 sparked a series of sectarian clashes in not only Ardoyne but also the interface between the loyalist Tiger's Bay area and the republican Newington and New Lodge districts. ===July 12 rioting=== During the Holy Cross dispute period rioting also took place in Ardoyne on 12 July after an Orange Order parade. ==Ardoyne's murals== Like most working class areas in Belfast, and others in the rest of Northern Ireland, Ardoyne's walls feature a number of murals related to politics and culture, although republican topics have been de-emphasised since 2009. Most of these murals were done by Michael Doherty, an Ardoyne resident. A mural on Ardoyne Avenue depicted victims of the famine with the legend \\"An Gorta Mor (The Great Hunger) ‚Äì They buried us without shroud nor coffin\\" although this has since been removed. Another depicting a mass rock is still extant on the same street, although a further mural on Ardoyne Avenue showing Cuchulainn and a hound with the legend \\"Ard-Eoin Fleadh Cheoil\\" has also been removed. A mural demanding the truth about the killings of Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson is also gone. A mural on the street recalling the Holy Cross dispute and comparing it to the Little Rock Nine is recorded by CAIN as still in existence, although it too has been removed. A mural commemorating the Flight of the Earls was one of four painted in the area in 2009 to cover up those of a republican nature. A number of other murals have also been painted on nearby Berwick Road. A Sinn F√©in youth emblem with demands to disband the RUC and free republican prisoners has been removed, along with a portrait of James Connolly. A representation of the Virgin Mary remains in existence. It is close to a mural commemorating the 1916 Easter Rising. ==Culture in Ardoyne== ===Sport=== Football is a widely played and followed sport in the area. Ardoyne is close to the home ground of Irish Football League club Cliftonville, and as such the club enjoys a wide following in the area. Ardoyne itself is home to Crumlin Star F.C., an intermediate club that currently plays in Northern Amateur Football League Premier Division. However, despite originating in Ardoyne and having their headquarters in the area they do not have a home ground locally and for the 2013‚Äì14 season play their matches at the Cliff in Larne. Crumlin Star's social club is also a Celtic supporters club, with the Glasgow club enjoying strong popularity in the area and amongst the nationalist community in general. The Gaelic Athletic Association is also represented in the area through local club Ardoyne Kickhams, who are affiliated to the Antrim GAA.Ard Eoin Kickhams website ===Music=== The area is home to the annual \\"Ard Eoin Fleadh Cheoil\\" (Ardoyne Music Festival). The festival attracts some of the most famous Irish musical acts, including the Wolfe Tones. The Ardoyne Fleadh committee is chaired by Eddie Copeland. In recent years the Ardoyne Fleadh came under fire from Unionists in Belfast after a 'hate speech' was made by a member of headlining bands 'The Druids'. A video from the event shows a member of the band telling the audience that British soldiers in Ireland \\"should get together with their Orange comrades\\" and go back to England. ==Ardoyne in popular culture== Ardoyne is the setting in which Anna Burns' novel No Bones takes place. In this novel she describes a girl growing up in Ardoyne during the Troubles.Anna Burns: No Bones, 2001 ==See also== *The Night We Burned Ardoyne == References == Category:Geography of Belfast Category:Electoral wards of Belfast ","title":"Ardoyne"},{"id":"1428255","text":"Legislative Assembly election results of Chhattisgarh, India. ==2003== { - bgcolor=\\"efefef\\"  Party  Candidates fielded  Candidates elected  No. of votes  % of total -  Bharatiya Janata Party  90  50  3 789 914  39.26% -  Bahujan Samaj Party  54  2  429 334  4.45% -  Communist Party of India  18   103 776  1.08% -  Communist Party of India (Marxist)  6   27 521  0.29% -  Indian National Congress  90  37  3 743 754  37.71% -  Nationalist Congress Party  89  1  677 983  7.02% -  Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation  5   4 888  0.05% -  Janata Dal (United)  18   16 657  0.17% -  Jharkhand Mukti Morcha  8   10 008  0.10% -  Shiv Sena  2   2 087  0.02% -  Samajwadi Party  52   91 905  0.95% -  Akhil Bharatiya Bharat Mata ‚Äì Putra Paksha  1   2 655  0.03% -  Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha  3   1 384  0.01% -  Akhil Bharatiya Jan Sangh  1   1 462  0.02% -  Akhil Bharatiya Manav Adhikar Dal  1   74  0.00% -  Apna Dal  7   12 749  0.13% -  Chhattisgarh Mukti Morcha  8   37 335  0.39% -  Chhattisgarhi Samaj Party  20   18 284  0.19% -  Gondvana Gantantra Party  41   154 446  1.60% -  Jai Prakash Janata Dal  4   3 995  0.04% -  Lok Janshakti Party  12   8 059  0.08% -  Lokpriya Samaj Party  2   1 115  0.01% -  Loktantrik Samajwadi Party  11   8 365  0.09% -  Republican Party of India  5   5 411  0.06% -  Republican Party of India (Athvale)  6   2 540  0.03% -  Shoshit Samaj Party  1   406  0.00% -  Samajwadi Janata Party (Rashtriya)  3   679  0.01% -  Yuva Gantantra Party  7   9 843  0.10% -  Independents  254   686 942  7.12% -  Total:  819  90  9653571  } ==References== Category:State Assembly elections in Chhattisgarh Category:Results of State Assembly elections in India ","title":"Assembly election results of Chhattisgarh"},{"id":"1428265","text":"The American College of Physicians (ACP) is a national organization of internists, who specialize in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of adults.Sokanu - \\"What is an Internist?\\".

After obtaining a practical knowledge of forestry from his uncle at Harzburg, he studied from 1781 to 1783 at the University of Giessen, which had commenced a course of instruction in forestry just a few years earlier, in 1778. == Career == In 1786, Hartwig was appointed as Manager of Forests for the Prince of Solms-Braunfels at Hungen, in the Wetterau, Hesse. While in this position, he founded a school for the teaching of forestry, one of the first dedicated schools of forestry in Europe. After a decade in Hungen, in 1797, he received an appointment as Inspector of Forests to the Prince of Orange-Nassau and moved to Dillenburg, continuing his school of forestry there. Attendance increased considerably in Dillenburg. On the dissolution of the principality by Napoleon I of France in 1805 he lost his position. In 1806, Hartig went to Stuttgart as Chief Inspector of Forests. Five years later, in 1811, he was called to Berlin in a similar capacity. There he reestablished his school once again, succeeding in connecting it with the University of Berlin. Hartwig received an appointment as Honorary Professor at the University of Berlin in 1830. He died at Berlin on 2 February 1837.

Camus, c. 1890. Ernest Guiraud (; 23 June 18376 May 1892)Macdonald 2001; Wright 1992; NY Times 1892. gives his birthdate as 26 June 1837. was a French composer and music teacher born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He is best known for writing the traditional orchestral recitatives used for Bizet's opera Carmen and for Offenbach's opera Les contes d'Hoffmann (The Tales of Hoffmann). ==Biography== Guiraud began his schooling in Louisiana under the tutelage of his father, Jean-Baptiste-Louis Guiraud, who had won the Prix de Rome in 1827. At age 15, he set a full-length libretto about King David to music that he and his father had found on a trip to Paris. The result was David, an opera in three-acts, which had a resounding success at the Th√©√¢tre d'Orl√©ans in New Orleans in 1853, sealing his future. In December of the same year, Guiraud sailed back to France to continue his musical education. He studied piano under Marmontel and composition under Hal√©vy at the Paris Conservatoire. Remarkably gifted as a student, he was awarded first prize for piano in 1858. He won the Prix de Rome the next year, notably, the only instance of both father and son obtaining this prize. He became close friends with Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, Emile Paladilhe, Th√©odore Dubois, and especially Georges Bizet. Guiraud entered his profession by writing one-act stage works that served as \\"curtain raisers\\" for evenings of theatrical entertainment. His first important stagework, Sylvie, which premiered at the Op√©ra Comique in 1864, was a popular success and established his reputation in Paris. In August 1870, the impact of the Franco-Prussian War hit Paris while his op√©ra-ballet Le Kobold was only 18 days into its run. All of the theaters closed their doors. Guiraud enlisted in the infantry and fought for France to the war's end in 1871. Although Guiraud's primary interest was the composition of operas, most of them were not a success. Madame Turlupin (1872) was a succ√®s d'estime, but it was hampered by an old- fashioned libretto. Piccolino, his three-act op√©ra comique first performed in 1876, represents the peak of his career. An appealing sorrentino sung by C√©lestine Mari√©, known as Galli-Mari√©, and a brilliant and effective ballet entitled Carnaval (a movement from his \\"First Orchestral Suite\\") enabled the work achieve a long run. However, the opera was never revived. After Bizet's death, Guiraud collected Bizet's original scores and arranged the frequently performed L'Arl√©sienne Suite No. 2. He also arranged twelve numbers from Bizet's opera Carmen into two Carmen Suites. Guiraud is perhaps most famous for constructing the recitatives‚Äîboth beloved and criticized‚Äîthat replaced the spoken dialogue in performances of Carmen for more than a century. He also wrote the recitatives and completed the score of Jacques Offenbach's masterpiece Les contes d'Hoffman (The Tales of Hoffmann) which was left unfinished at Offenbach's death. Guiraud's version was very popular but it was not exclusively performed because Offenbach left an enormous number of sketches that various composers and arrangers have used to make their realisations of the opera. The amount of Guiraud's own musical output is small, probably due to his desire to help his friends as well as demands from his teaching career. Of his compositions in other forms, his ballet Le Forgeron de Gretna Green, given at the Salle Le Peletier of the Paris Op√©ra (5 May 1873), Caprice for violin and orchestra (1885), and Chasse fantastique, a symphonic poem (1887), are best known. (He also made a popular piano arrangement, for four hands, of Saint-Sa√´ns's Danse macabre.) Beginning in 1876, Guiraud taught at the Paris Conservatoire. He was a founding member of the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique and the author of a treatise on instrumentation. In 1891, Guiraud was elected member of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts and was appointed professor of composition at the Conservatoire to replace Victor Mass√©. Guiraud's teaching methods for harmony and orchestration were highly respected and recognized in musical circles. His musical theories had a strong and beneficial influence on Claude Debussy, whose notes were published by Maurice Emmanuel in his book devoted to Pell√©as et M√©lisande. Andr√© Bloch, M√©lanie Bonis, Paul Dukas, Achille Fortier, Andr√© Gedalge and Erik Satie are also counted among his students. Guiraud devoted the years 1891 and 1892 to completing the orchestration for Kassya, a five-act opera by L√©o Delibes. However, it was left unfinished due to his own death in Paris at age 54. ==Operas== * David, op√©ra (3 acts, after A. Soumet & F.

Set in the land of Tolemac (\\"Camelot\\" spelled backwards), the game follows a non-traditional Zelda-saves-Link storyline, in which Link has been captured by the evil lord Ganon, and Zelda must collect the seven celestial signs in order to rescue him. Released nearly 8 months after the first two Zelda CD-i games, Zelda's Adventure uses a different game engine from Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon. Whereas the first two CD-i games were patterned on the side-scrolling Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Zelda's Adventure took the top-down The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, and Link's Awakening as its models. Zelda's Adventure is the only Legend of Zelda game to feature live-action cutscenes. Reception for the game was negative, and whereas some critics have given more nuanced reviews of the first two games, modern criticism for Zelda's Adventure is one of the worst video games. ==Gameplay== Gameplay screenshot. Unlike the previous two CD-i Zelda games, which take the side-scrolling view from Zelda II, Zelda's Adventure is played with the overhead view found in The Legend of Zelda. Playing as Princess Zelda, the aim is to fight through the Seven Shrines of the Underworld to collect the celestial signs, and bring the land of Tolemac to an Age of Lightness. Unlike the other two games, Zelda's Adventure was created by Viridis, an entirely different company, with a change in style and gameplay. Level design is very much like the original The Legend of Zelda and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, with an overworld that allows access to individual dungeons. The FMV sequences that present the plot are live action instead of animated. == Plot == Ganon has kidnapped Link and stolen the seven celestial signs, creating an \\"Age of Darkness\\" in the kingdom of Tolemac. Princess Zelda is recruited by the court astrologer Gaspra (played by Mark Andrade) to collect the signs to defeat Ganon and save Link. Guided by the words of Shurmak, Zelda must first travel through the forest to the Shrine of Rock, where she encounters Llort, a greedy minion of Ganon who protects the first celestial sign. Gaspra appears to congratulate Zelda and direct her to the Shrine of Illusion where she faces Pasquinade to earn the second celestial sign. Guided by the inhabitants of Tolemac, Zelda then makes her way to the mountains to conquer the Shrines of Air and Destiny before crossing the great south sea to challenge Agwanda at the Shrine of Water for the fifth sign. Gaspra directs Zelda once more to the Shrine of Power in the southeast where her strength is tested, before travelling to the Shrine of Fire where she will face Warbane. As Zelda reaches to collect the final celestial sign Ganon's claw stops her, and she is drawn into his lair for the final battle. In the game's final scenes, peace returns to Tolemac. Link is revealed to be safe, holding hands with Zelda where the entrance to Ganon's lair once stood, the land now thriving with new growth. == Development == In 1989, Nintendo signed a deal with Sony to begin development of a CD-ROM-based system known as the \\"Nintendo PlayStation\\" or the SNES CD to be an add-on to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System that would allow for FMV and larger games. However, Nintendo broke the agreement and instead signed with Philips to make the add- on, which caused Sony to spin off their add-on into its own console called the PlayStation. Witnessing the poor reception of the Sega Mega-CD, Nintendo scrapped the idea of making an add-on entirely. As part of dissolving the agreement with Philips, Nintendo gave them the license to use five of their characters, including Link, Princess Zelda, and Ganon, for games on Philips's console called the CD-i, after the partnership's dissolution. Contracting out to independent studios, Philips subsequently used the characters to create three games for the CD-i, with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give input on the look of the characters based on the artwork from Nintendo's original two titles and that of their respective instruction booklets.The Making of... Zelda: 'Wand of Gamelon' & 'Link: Faces of Evil'. Retro Gamer. Issue 27. p. 52-57. August 2006. Philips insisted that the development studios utilize all aspects of the CD-i's capabilities including FMV, high-resolution graphics, and CD-quality music. Because the system had not been designed as a dedicated video game console, there were several technical limitations, such as laggy controls (especially for the standard infrared controller), and numerous problems in streaming-audio, memory, disc access, and graphics. The backgrounds for Zelda's Adventure were created from videos of scenery near Santa Monica Boulevard in West L.A., footage of Hawaii taken from a helicopter, and the developers' vacation photos. This decision was responsible for much of the game's RAM usage, causing backgrounds to scroll slowly and causing extreme frustration to the game's developers. The CD-i's technical abilities were so limited that the use of one or two kilobytes of system RAM caused arguments amongst the developers. Photos of the characters were shot using mirrors mounted on the ceiling, which was so low it precluded mounting the camera. All of the game's human characters were played by the in-office staff. The characters sprite walking animations were done by having the actors walk on a motorized treadmill. The game's music composer Mark Andrade also played the part of Gaspra in the game's cutscenes, while his voice was provided by Hal Smith. Zelda in the game's cutscene was played by office receptionist Diane Burns, while her sprite was played by Annie Ward. The houses and interiors built for the cut scenes were built as scale models. The model artist was Jason Bakutis, who had worked in Hollywood on movies like Critters 3 and Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. Developers have stated they were not influenced by the first two CD-i Zelda games. Zelda's Adventure spent two years in testing, longer than it took to develop the game. Much more music was composed for the game than was used. Developers had difficulty making sure all the areas of the game had proper background masking. There were plans at one point to hire Echo & the Bunnymen to do the music. Intending to push the capacities of the CD-i to its limits, development initially progressed with a goal of 600 screens and 160 NPCs. At this early stage, Viridis president Lee Barnes suggested that playthrough time might take as much as 300 hours.\\"New Nintendo Titles are in the Pipeline.\\" CDi Magazine. Pg.4. These development figures were reduced in the final product which had only a handful of NPCs and whose playthrough time has been placed by one commentator at only 12 hours.Szczepaniak, John. Your Weekly Kusoge #03 - Zelda's Adventure - CDi (1995). HardcoreGaming101. 2011. The majority of the game's programming was done by one person - Randy Casey. Randy was responsible for programming all of the game and all associated tools. Additional programming for the inventory system and game progress tracking, dubbed \\"FRP engine\\" was done by Gavin James. There is conflicting information about the game's budget‚Äîone developer claims there was \\"no budget at all\\" while Bakutis claims (possibly facetiously) it had \\"at the time, the biggest budget ever for a video game\\". ==Reception== Zelda's Adventure was widely panned by critics. The graphics of Zelda's Adventure were called \\"blurry and digitized\\". Wired magazine said that the graphics were some of the worst ever encountered. The game's acting was criticized as unprofessional. Another flaw that has been identified is that the game could not produce both sound effects and music at the same time. Scott Sharkey of 1UP.com called the box art of Zelda's Adventure one of the 15 worst ever made. Zelda's Adventure was released as the Philips CD-i was being discontinued and has become very rare over time, as have the first two Philips Zelda games; Zelda's Adventure is regularly sold for over $100. Zelda's Adventure appeared in a bracket poll of \\"The Greatest Legend of Zelda Game\\" along with Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon. It lost in the first set of rounds to The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Despite giving positive reviews for Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon neither Danny Cowan of 1UP.com nor RetroGamer John Szczepaniak would extend them to Zelda's Adventure, which Szczepaniak described as demonstrating arbitrary and illogical design, sloppy visuals, nearly non-existent music, excruciatingly high difficulty and cumbersome loading and controlling. Gameplay for Zelda's Adventure has also been portrayed as a trial-and-error effort to guess which items can be used to defeat which enemy.The Making of... Zelda: 'Wand of Gamelon' & 'Link: Faces of Evil' - Deserving Damnation. Retro Gamer. Issue 27. p. 57. August 2006. Cowan called Zelda's Adventure \\"practically unplayable\\" due to the jerky frame rate, unresponsive controls and long load times, summarizing his review with a warning to \\"avoid this game at all costs.\\" In discussing the popular online conception that Zelda's Adventure is superior to Wand of Gamelon and Faces of Evil, RetroGamer pointed to the top-down perspective as fomenting misinformation regarding the game's similarities to the original Zelda when, according to RetroGamer, the game is actually not worth playing. ==References== Category:1994 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:CD-i games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Nintendo CD-i games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Single-player video games Category:The Legend of Zelda spin-off games ","title":"Zelda's Adventure"},{"id":"1428304","text":"Kaira or KAIRA may refer to: ==Places== * Kaira (Lydia), a town of ancient Lydia, now in Turkey ===In India=== * Kheda, also known as Kaira, a town in Gujarat, India ** Kaira district ** Kaira Agency, a former administrative unit ** Kaira (Lok Sabha constituency) == People with the name == * Mulaza Kaira (born 1984), Zambian musician * Qamar Zaman Kaira (born 1960), Pakistani politician * Tanveer Ashraf Kaira (born 1960), Pakistani politician * Kaira Gong (born 1981), Singaporean singer == Other uses == *The Gayiri people of central Queensland, also spelt Kaira * Kaira (spider), a genus of spiders * KAIRA, a astronomical observatory in Finland == See also == * Khaira (disambiguation) * Keira (disambiguation) * Les Ka√Øra, a 2012 French film ","title":"Kaira"},{"id":"1428311","text":"Holbury is a village in Hampshire, England. It is part of the parish of Fawley. ==Overview== Historically a small and scarcely populated village, Holbury and the adjoining hamlet of Hardley now has a sizeable population and a considerable number of shops and businesses.Holbury Virtual High Street This growth has been principally due to the influence of the Esso oil refinery at Fawley and the area's proximity to the city of Southampton. It is served by a number of schools, including Manor Infant School for children aged 4 to 8,Manor Infant School Cadland Primary School (formerly Holbury Infant School and Holbury Junior School) for children aged 4 to 11,Cadland Primary School and New Forest Academy for students aged 11 to 16.New Forest Academy The school also has an incorporated sixth form college for students aged 16 to 18.

Four years later Henry VIII granted it to Robert Whyte in exchange for a manor and lands in Middlesex. Some time before 1560 the manor fell into the hands of Thomas Pace. After the death of Thomas Pace, Holbury Manor was combined with the estates of Cadlands (now beneath Fawley Refinery) and Langley. In 1641 Peter Cardonell, a Norman merchant from Caen, leased the estates from Nicholas Pescod, and Holbury is mentioned as a whole manor when Nicholas Pescod granted a lease of the site to Adam de Cardonell, probably the son of Peter. Henceforth the combined estates were divided, and that part which corresponds to Holbury Farm passed into the Stanley family in 1693. Holbury manor house is a 17th/18th century recasing in red brick of an earlier building, originally a Tudor mansion.Hampshire Treasures, Volume 5 (New Forest), Page 125 Next to it is a moated site, perhaps the site of the monastic manor and associated buildings.

He was educated for the Church, and at Leiden actually preached a sermon as a candidate for the pastorate. But he abandoned theology for more secular studies, especially that of ancient history, in which his learning attracted the notice of the Prince of Orange, who promised him a vacant professorship at Utrecht. On his arrival, however, he found that another scholar had been elected by the local authorities, and he thereupon sought and obtained a commission in the Dutch army. He made the campaigns of 1747-48 in the Low Countries. In the peace which followed, his combined military and classical training turned his thoughts in the direction of ancient military history. His notes on this subject grew into a treatise, and in 1754 he went over to England in order to consult various libraries. In 1757 his M√©moires militaires sur les Grecs et les Romains appeared at the Hague, and when Carlyle wrote his Frederick the Great it had reached its fifth edition. Coming back, with English introductions, to the Continent, he sought service with Ferdinand of Brunswick, who sent him on to Frederick the Great, whom he joined in January 1758 at Breslau. The king was very favourably impressed with Guichard and his works, and he remained for nearly 18 months in the royal suite. His Prussian official name of Quintus Icilius was the outcome of a friendly dispute with the king (see Nikolai, Anekdoten, vi. 129-145; Carlyle, Frederick the Great, viii. 113-114). Frederick in discussing the battle of Pharsalia spoke of a centurion Quintus Caecilius as Q. Icilius. Guichard ventured to correct him, whereupon the king said, \\"You shall be Quintus Icilius,\\" and as Major Quintus Icilius he was forthwith gazetted to the command of a free battalion. This corps he commanded throughout the later stages of the Seven Years' War, his battalion, as time went on, becoming a regiment of three battalions, and Quintus himself recruited seven more battalions of the same kind of troops. His command was almost always with the king's own army in these campaigns, but for a short time it fought in the western theatre under Prince Henry. When not on the march he was always at the royal headquarters, and it was he who brought about the famous interview between the king and Gellert (see Carlyle, Frederick the Great, ix. log; Gellert, Briefwechsel mit Demoiselle Lucius, ed. Ebert, Leipzig, 1823, pp. 629‚Äì631) on the subject of national German literature. On January 22, 1761 Quintus was ordered to sack the castle of Hubertusburg (a task which Major- General Saldern had point-blank refused to undertake, from motives of conscience), and carried out his task, it is said, to his own very considerable profit. The place cannot have been seriously injured, as it was soon afterwards the meeting-place of the diplomats whose work ended in the Treaty of Hubertusburg, but the king never ceased to banter Quintus on his supposed depredations. The very day of Frederick's triumphant return from the war saw the disbanding of most of the free battalions, including that of Quintus, but the major to the end of his life remained with the king. He was made lieutenant-colonel in 1765, and in 1773, in recognition of his work M√©moires critiques et historiques sur plusieurs points d'antiquit√©s militaires, dealing mainly with Julius Caesar's campaigns in Spain (Berlin, 1773), was promoted colonel. He died at Potsdam in 1775. ==References== ;Attribution * Category:1724 births Category:1775 deaths Category:German Calvinist and Reformed Christians Category:German military personnel of the Seven Years' War Category:Huguenots Category:Prussian Army personnel Category:People from Magdeburg Category:German male writers ","title":"Karl Gottlieb Guichard"},{"id":"1428315","text":"Menkheperre, son of Pharaoh Pinedjem I by wife Duathathor-Henuttawy (daughter of Ramesses XI by wife Tentamon), was the High Priest of Amun at Thebes in ancient Egypt from 1045 BC to 992 BC and de facto ruler of the south of the country., p.207 ==Biography== Menkheperre's eldest full brother Masaharta followed their father Pinedjem I as High Priest.

A major figure in Brazilian Pre-Modernism, he is famous for the novel Triste Fim de Policarpo Quaresma, a bitter satire of the first years of the Rep√∫blica Velha in Brazil. ==Life== Lima Barreto was born on 13 May 1881 in the bairro of Laranjeiras in Rio de Janeiro. He was born on a Friday the 13th, considered superstitiously to be an unlucky day, but which he personally considered to bring good luck. His date of birth would also be marked seven years later by the signing of the Golden Law, which abolished slavery in Brazil. His father, Jo√£o Henriques de Lima Barreto, was a typographer and a monarchist who had close connections to Afonso Celso de Assis Figueiredo, the Viscount of Ouro Preto, who would later become Lima Barreto's godfather. Barreto's mother, Am√°lia Augusta, died when he was very young, and he was subsequently sent to study at a private school run by Teresa Pimentel do Amaral. Soon after, he entered at the Liceu Popular Niteroiense, after the Viscount of Ouro Preto decided to pay for his studies. He graduated in 1894, and in the following year, he would enter the famous Col√©gio Pedro II. Soon after he graduated, he entered the Escola Polit√©cnica do Rio de Janeiro, but was forced to abandon it in 1904 in order to take care of his brothers, since his father's mental health was starting to deteriorate. Barreto used to write for newspapers since 1902, but he achieved fame in 1905, writing a series of articles for the Correio da Manh√£ regarding the demolition of Castle Hill. In 1911 he founded, alongside some friends, a periodical named Floreal. Although it only lasted for two issues, it received a warm reception from the critics. In 1909 he published his first novel, Recorda√ß√µes do Escriv√£o Isa√≠as Caminha, a scathing and semi-autobiographical satire of the Brazilian society. However, his masterpiece is generally considered to be Triste Fim de Policarpo Quaresma, which was published in 1911, under feuilleton form, being re-released under hardcover form in 1915. During the last years of his life, Barreto was attacked by heavy bouts of depression, which led him to alcoholism and many visits to different psychiatric hospitals and sanatoriums. He died of a heart attack in 1922. ==Style== Barreto was a very satirical author. His favoured target of criticism was the perceived mediocrity of the Brazilian people, mainly the government and the commercial/military authorities. One of his works that best represents this style is Os Bruzundangas, a collection of tales he published in newspapers during a period of 20 years. The author also heavily criticized the baroque and difficult writing style which was popular among Brazilian authorities as a symbol of \\"intelligence\\" and \\"high social status\\". Due to his feelings on this issue, Barreto adopted a more simple style in his books which was more accessible to a majority of the Brazilian people. This provoked an increasing number of criticisms against the author, who was persecuted by the Brazilian elite for his non-classical style. Barreto also explored the psychological conditions of his characters, although he is not as well known for this as other prominent Lusophone writers like the Brazilian Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis or the Portuguese Jos√© Maria de E√ßa de Queiroz. His books often explore the curious beliefs and thoughts of his characters: for example, Policarpo Quaresma (Barreto's most legendary creation) was a radical and almost utopian patriot, and his beliefs led him to a tragic end. Policarpo was also innocent enough to believe the Brazilian \\"original nature\\" could be restored. Exaggerated innocence had also condemned the character Clara dos Anjos to a life of dishonor. As for the antagonists, Barreto explores their hypocrisy, ignorance and indifference to the suffering of others. Psychopathy is presented in his posthumous book Clara dos Anjos through the antagonist, Cassi Jones, who has typical habits of a social psychopath: absence of care for other people's feelings, selfishness and cold calculation to achieve his goals, no matter how vile they are. == Major works == ===Triste Fim de Policarpo Quaresma=== Triste Fim de Policarpo Quaresma (in English: The Tragic Fate of Policarpo Quaresma) is Barreto's magnum opus, first published in 1911. It tells the story of Policarpo Quaresma, a radical Brazilian patriot. Policarpo's dearest dream is to see Brazil as one of the world's most powerful nations. He notices many problems in the political and social structure of his country, realizing that Brazilian people love European culture more than their own country's and tries to change this reality. The story, then, can be divided in three distinct parts: ; The cultural reform: Policarpo Quaresma tries to change the Brazilian official language (Portuguese) to Tupi, a Native American language. He sends a letter to the Government, asking for the Tupi language to be adopted as the official language of Brazil. His curious request soon becomes news, and Policarpo is ridiculed by the local press. Quaresma then retreats to the town of Curuzu, in rural Rio de Janeiro, where he begins a new activity; ; The agricultural reform: Policarpo constructs, with the help of an old black man, a little farm and tries to sell his products to the capital. His desire is to make people see how valuable could be the Brazilian lands. Unfortunately, a plague invades his field and he begins a little war against the ants and the vermin. A local politician then arrives in his home praying for electoral support, but Policarpo refuses the offer. Then, by revenge, the politician starts to damage Policarpo's farm. At this moment, Brazil has sunken into chaos due to popular revolutions, and Policarpo is recruited to the Revolta da Armada war; ; The military reform: While trying to defend a fort, Policarpo sees many problems in the Brazilian military structure and sends a letter to the president, Floriano Peixoto, a rude and ignorant man, praying for better conditions for the war prisoners and the other soldiers of the fort. Floriano, when reads the letter, considers Policarpo a revolutionary man and condemns him to death. At the end of the story, Policarpo Quaresma is killed for high treason. === Os Bruzundangas === A collection of tales that Lima Barreto published in newspaper during the period of 20 years, approximately. It tells the life and customs of the People of Bruzundanga, an imaginary country that represents Brazil. In the book, tale by tale, Barreto tells of the corruption present in every sector of the Bruzundanga's life, from politics to education. Lima Barreto decided to create a new country to represent Brazil in order to escape from politician and any other authority's persecution. In fact, The Bruzundangas itself is a great allegory to Brazilian famous personalities and public institutions. A notorious example can be found in the book's first chapter, which is called \\"Special Chapter\\": the narrator teaches about Bruzundanga's literature, which is conduced by the elitist school of the \\"Samoiedas\\". In this literary school, the students get satisfied \\"only with shallow literary appearances and an ordinary simulation of notoriety, sometimes because of their intellectual incapacity and some other times by a vicious and careless instruction\\", as Barreto himself wrote. In this case, the \\"Samoiedas' school\\" is an allegory to the Brazilian classical writing style, which was still heavily influenced by the Parnassianism and Symbolism. ===Clara dos Anjos=== This posthumous novel presents the character Clara dos Anjos, a girl from a poor family that lives in the suburb of Rio de Janeiro. The story is about Clara's passion for Cassi Jones, an unscrupulous boy and son of a richer family. Cassi, who has made an uncountable number of women pregnant and abandoned them all, seduces Clara for his libidinous purposes. Clara, who is innocent due her parents' severe protectionism, ends up pregnant. At the end, Cassi flees and Clara finds herself abandoned and \\"dishonored\\". In his book, Barreto intends to show how disgraced is the destiny of poor women in Brazil, as he demonstrates in Clara's last quote: \\"We are nothing in this life\\". More than that, however, the author also shows the hypocrisy of rich people (mainly represented by Cassi's mother, who constantly protects her son) and the absurd selfishness of the Brazilian youth (represented by the character Cassi Jones). === Other works === * O Subterr√¢neo do Morro do Castelo (1905) * Recorda√ß√µes do Escriv√£o Isa√≠as Caminha (1909) * O Homem que Sabia Javan√™s e outros contos (1911) * Vida e Morte de M.

Headed by Seymour Marco, an optometrist, the company started to grow and, after a few years, Marco bought out the New York owners so he could significantly grow the business. During the 1970s, he developed a new material (etafilcon A) and began making soft lenses at Frontier. In 1981 he sold the company to Johnson & Johnson. J&J; renamed Frontier Contact Lenses to Vistakon. With the acquisition of a very manual process - every employee on the production line, whether they were lathing, polishing or inspecting, handled the lenses - scaling up the business was very limited, so Vistakon decided to invest into a new production process. Utilizing Stabilized Soft Molding (SSM) technology, Vistakon undertook a major overhaul in its production processes. As a result Acuvue was introduced to the market in 1986. The lens was originally indicated for seven-day extended wear and later became a daily wear lens. Today, there is a line which ranges from the 1-day wear to two-week lenses such as the Acuvue 2 and Oasys and the Vita monthly lens. Today, all of Vistakon's manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, with the exception of one plant located in Limerick, Republic of Ireland. ==Family of Acuvue brands== Daily Disposable Contact Lenses: *1-Day Acuvue - hydrogel material (available for astigmatism) *1-Day Acuvue Moist - hydrogel material (available for astigmatism and presbyopia) *1-Day Acuvue TruEye - first silicone hydrogel daily disposable released 2008 in European Markets and 2010 in North America. *1-Day Acuvue Define - hydrogel material (UK release solely in Boots and D&A; opticians in 2010) *1-Day Acuvue Define Accent - hydrogel material (Far East markets) *1-Day Acuvue Oasys with HydraLuxe - silicone hydrogel material (available for astigmatism) Two Week Disposable: *Acuvue 2 - hydrogel material *Acuvue Advance - silicone hydrogel material (available for astigmatism) *Acuvue Oasys - silicone hydrogel material (available for presbyopia in US and astigmatism in most other markets) Monthly Disposable: *Acuvue Vita - Methyl ether cellulose With INFINITY EDGE‚Ñ¢ design and HydraMax‚Ñ¢ Technology.

The decoration is awarded to any member or contributor to the National Intelligence Community, either civilian or military, who distinguishes themselves by meritorious actions to the betterment of national security in the United States of America, through sustained and selfless service of the highest order. The National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal was once considered junior to the older National Security Medal.Director of Central Intelligence Directive 7/1 With the establishment of the National Intelligence Awards (NIA) Program by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal was the highest decoration in the program. An update to the NIA program added awards and changed precedence, with the NIDSM being succeeded by the Intelligence Community Medal for Valor in the order of precedence. As an authorized U.S. non-military decoration on U.S. military uniforms, the National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal is worn after U.S. military unit awards and before U.S. military campaign and service awards. ==Appearance== The National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal is a gold colored medal across. The obverse design consists of a white 16 pointed star surmounted by a gold heraldic rose. In the center of the rose is a dark blue disc bearing an eight pointed compass rose in gold. The reverse bears the words NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE, one word on each line, all in gold. The medal's ribbon, which is from the original, is wide. The ribbon is white with blue stripes at both edges. In the center is a scarlet stripe flanked by yellow stripes. Symbolically, the heraldic rose is a symbol of secrecy and confidence, referring to the term sub rosa which is Latin for \\"under the rose.\\" That symbol has traditionally been used to describe something to be kept secret and not repeated elsewhere. Blue represents loyalty, and is taken from the seal of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The compass rose in the center of the medal symbolizes the world-wide mission of the organization, while the points of the white star also allude to compass points. The white color represents honesty, truth and optimism. ==Known recipients== == Recipients gallery == File:Barack Obama James L Jones and James R Clapper 20101020.jpgBarack Obama and James R.

Oxford: Architectural, 2011. 154. Print. is a traditional woodworking hand tool used to shape wood by removing shavings. It consists of a blade with a handle at each end. The blade is much longer (along the cutting edge) than it is deep (from cutting edge to back edge). It is pulled or \\"drawn\\" (hence the name) toward the user. The drawknife in the illustration has a blade although much shorter drawknives are also made. The blade is sharpened to a chisel bevel. Traditionally, it is a rounded, smooth bevel. The handles can be below the level of the blade (as in the illustration) or at the same level.American Woodworker May‚ÄìJune 1990, No 14. 72 pages pp:39 == Purpose == Using a drawknife in making a flatbow A drawknife is commonly used to remove large slices of wood for flat faceted work, to debark trees, or to create roughly rounded or cylindrical billets for further work on a lathe, or it can shave like a spokeshave plane, where finer finishing is less of concern than a rapid result. The thin blade lends itself to create complex concave or convex curves. Unlike a spokeshave, it does not have a closed mouth to control chip formation, and so lacks the spokeshave's superior cutting and shaving precision.Underhill, Roy. The Woodwright's Shop: a Practical Guide to Traditional Woodcraft, University of North Carolina Press: 1981, , 202 pages, pp. 39-40 They are also a vital piece of equipment in hand-made cricket bats, being used to shape the curve of the bat. === Operation === The drawknife ideally is used when the operator is in a seated position astride a traditional shaving horse, which safely grips the working stock, and they can also use their legs for additional pulling power. The ideal working stock has the grain of the wood running parallel to the shaving horse, and perpendicular to the blade of the drawknife, so that the drawknife shaves away the entire wood fibre and does not cut against it. It is best not pulled with blade perfectly perpendicular to the wood stock, but pulled slightly upward toward them in a skewed (blade at a slight diagonal) or slithering fashion, aiming not to take off as much wood as possible, but gradually \\"shave\\" the work. The operator gently levers the blade to \\"bite\\" into the wood and then controls the depth of the cut by raising or lowering the handles as they pull the drawknife towards them.American Woodworker Dec 1995: No.49, New Track Media, pp: 43‚Äì45. Draw shaves are often used with shaving horses. Use of a drawknife and shaving horse from De Re Metallica, a sixteenth-century work on mine technology === Straight cuts === One works from the centre of the piece to the end, not the entire length all at once. The operator then reverses the piece in the shaving horse or vise and works from near centre to trim the \\"fatter\\" end to match the centre and just finished original \\"skinny\\" end. Final work can be done by spokeshave, sanding block or lathe. *When operated conventionally, that is blade bevel-side upward the drawknife takes deeper cuts and some novices may find it has a tendency to \\"dive\\" (cut unintentionally deep). *When operated bevel-side down there is the advantage of removing less stock, but the blade dulls more rapidly, requiring frequent honing. === Convex === The operator applies little leverage from centre and most leverage, so the blade \\"bites\\" deeper, thus removing more wood as they approach the end grain. === Concave === The operator applies minimal, then most, then least force on the handles from centre toward the end grain. The work stock is reversed and same method repeated this time commencing a tiny distance away from centre so as to leave a coarse raised section. The coarse raised section where the two concave curves meet can be finished with a rasp, file, spokeshave or other tool.American Woodworker Dec 1995: No.49, New Track Media, , pp: 43‚Äì45. === Splitting === For very rapid and rough removal of stock, the blade is drawn toward the user and rapidly levered into the wood to make as deep a cut as possible. The operator immediately stops pulling, and uses the drawknife blade to lever upward so as to \\"flick\\" the splinter or splice out of the worked piece. This technique is advanced and may damage the worked piece and drawknife blade if due care is not observed. Traditionally, the waste shavings, which are particularly durable, are used for basket weaving or for kindling. They also make excellent compost and plant bed material. Large drawknives can be used to dress logs, and small sizes for carving and shaving. A common use of a drawknife is to create a roughly cylindrical billet of wood for turning on a pole lathe. === Similar tools === A pushknife is a similar tool, used by pushing, rather than pulling. An inshave is a similar tool with a blade curved out to the side between the two handles. It is used to shave wood to form a hollowed out surface, such as the top of a chair seat. It is also called a scorp. There are also versions with a single handle. ==See also== * Spokeshave ==References== ==External links== * Green Woodwork * Craftsmanspace Free Shaving Horse Plan * Internet Archive PDF of Craftsmanspace Shaving-Horse plans * Paleo Planet Shaving Horse Plans Category:Green woodworking tools Category:Green woodworking Category:Woodworking hand tools ","title":"Drawknife"},{"id":"1428417","text":"Star transits (Reticle 2¬∞, magnif. ~10, two stars passing the vertical thread).

She was the fourth of the five famous Mancini sisters, who, along with two of their female Martinozzi cousins, were known at the court of King Louis XIV of France as the Mazarinettes. ==Early life, family and marriage== One of five sisters noted for their great beauty, she was born Ortensia in Rome to Baron Lorenzo Mancini, an Italian aristocrat. After his death in 1650, her mother, Girolama Mazzarini, brought her daughters from Rome to Paris in the hope of using the influence of her brother, Cardinal Mazarin, to gain them advantageous marriages. Hortense's four famous sisters were: * Laure (1636‚Äì1657), who married Louis de Bourbon, duc de Vend√¥me and became the mother of the famous French general Louis Joseph de Bourbon, duc de Vend√¥me, * Olympe (1638‚Äì1708), who married Eug√®ne-Maurice of Savoy-Carignano and became the mother of the famous Austrian general Prince Eugene of Savoy, * Marie (1639‚Äì1715), who married Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna and was the first romantic love of King Louis XIV of France, * Marie Anne (1649‚Äì1714), who married Godefroy Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon, a nephew of the famous field marshal Turenne. The sisters' cousins, the Martinozzis, also moved to France at the same time, for the same goal (to marry well). The elder, Anne Marie Martinozzi, married Armand de Bourbon, Prince de Conti. The younger, Laura, married Alfonso IV d'Este, duke of Modena and became the mother of Mary of Modena, second wife of James II of England. The Mancini also had three brothers: Paul, Philippe, and Alphonse. ===Marriage proposals=== Charles II of England, the first cousin of Louis XIV, proposed to Hortense in 1659, but his offer was rejected by Cardinal Mazarin who believed the exiled king to have little in the way of prospects. Mazarin realised his mistake when Charles was reinstated as King of England only months later. Mazarin then became the supplicant and offered a dowry of 5 million livres, but Charles refused. While a marriage did not materialise, the two were to cross paths later. Hortense's hand was also requested by Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy, another first cousin of Louis XIV, but arrangements fell through when Cardinal Mazarin refused to include the stronghold-castle of Pignerol in her dowry. For similar reasons, an offer made by the Duke of Lorraine was broken off as well. ===Failed marriage=== Hortense Mancini by Jacob Ferdinand Voet On 1 March 1661, fifteen-year-old Hortense was married to one of the richest men in Europe, Armand Charles de La Porte de La Meilleraye. Upon marriage to Hortense, he was granted the title of duc Mazarin. On the death of Cardinal Mazarin soon after, he gained access to his wife's huge inheritance, which included the Palais Mazarin in Paris, home to many pieces of fine art. The marriage was not a success. Hortense was young, bright, and popular; Armand- Charles was miserly and extremely jealous, not to mention mentally unstable. His strange behaviour included preventing milkmaids from going about their job (to his mind, the cows' udders had strong sexual connotations), having all of his female servants' front teeth knocked out to prevent them from attracting male attention, and chipping off and painting over all the \\"dirty bits\\" in his fantastic art collection. He forbade his wife to keep company with other men, made midnight searches for hidden lovers, insisted she spend a quarter of her day at prayer, and forced her to leave Paris and move with him to the country. Despite their differences, Hortense and her husband had four children: * Marie Charlotte de La Porte Mazarin (28 March 1662 ‚Äì 13 May 1729), who married Louis Armand de Vignerot du Plessis, comte d'Ag√©nias, duc d'Aiguillon, * Marie Anne de La Porte Mazarin (1663 ‚Äì October 1720), who became an abbess, * Marie Olympe de La Porte Mazarin (1665 ‚Äì 24 January 1754), who married Louis Christophe Gigault, marquis de Bellefonds et de Boullaye, * Paul Jules de La Porte, duc Mazarin et de La Meilleraye (25 January 1666 ‚Äì 7 September 1731), who married F√©lice Armande Charlotte de Durfort. ===Flight from marriage=== Leaving her small children behind, Hortense finally made a bid to escape from her hellish marriage on the night of 13 June 1668, with help from her brother, Philippe, Duc de Nevers, who procured horses and an escort to help her travel to Rome, where she counted on being able to take refuge with her sister Marie Mancini, now the Princess Colonna. ==Under the protection of Louis XIV and of the Duke of Savoy== The French king Louis XIV declared himself her protector and granted an annual pension of 24 thousand livres. Her former suitor, Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy, also declared himself her protector. As a result, Hortense retired to Chamb√©ry in Savoie and established her home as a meeting place for authors, philosophers, and artists. After the death of the duke, though, she was turned out by his widow, Marie Jeanne Baptiste of Savoy- Nemours, due to Hortense's romantic involvement with her husband. ==Charles II== Portrait of Hortense Mancini, duchesse de Mazarin, 17th century After the death of Savoy, Hortense had no source of income; her husband froze all of her income, including the pension from Louis XIV. The English ambassador to France, Ralph Montagu, aware of Hortense's desperate situation, enlisted her help in increasing his own standing with Charles II. He hoped she would replace the king's current mistress, Louise de Kerouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth. Hortense was willing to try. In 1675, she travelled to London under the pretext of a visit to her young niece, Mary of Modena, the new wife of Charles II's younger brother, James, Duke of York. She was dressed as a man; her penchant for cross-dressing is thought to be an outward expression of her bisexuality. ===Ma√Ætresse en titre=== By mid-1676, Hortense had fulfilled her purpose; she had taken the place of Louise de Kerouaille in Charles's affections. He provided her a pension of ¬£4,000, which considerably lightened her financial troubles. Montagu recounted: > I went to see Madame de Portsmouth [Louise de Kerouaille]. She opened her > heart to me‚Ä¶ explained to me what grief the frequent visits of the King of > England to Madame de Sussex [Hortense Mancini] cause her every day. ===Fall from favour=== Such state of affairs might have continued had it not been for Hortense's promiscuity. She was dubbed as the 'Italian Whore' in England. Firstly, there was her almost certainly sexual relationship with Anne, Countess of Sussex, the king's illegitimate daughter by the Duchess of Cleveland. This culminated in a very public, friendly fencing match in St. James's Park, with the women clad in nightgowns, after which Anne's husband ordered his wife to the country. There she refused to do anything but lie in bed, repeatedly kissing a miniature of Hortense. Secondly, she began an affair with Louis I de Grimaldi, Prince de Monaco. Charles remonstrated with her and cut off her pension, although within a couple of days he repented and restarted the payments. However, this signified the end of Hortense's position as the king's favourite. Though she and Charles remained friends, the Duchess of Portsmouth returned to her role as ‚Äômaitresse en titre‚Äô. The introduction to Aphra Behn's \\"The History of the Nun\\" has been taken as a suggestion that Behn too had romantic relations with Hortense during this same time. It reads: > to the Most Illustrious Princess, The Dutchess of Mazarine...how infinitely > one of Your own Sex ador'd You, and that, among all the numerous Conquest, > Your Grace has made over the Hearts of Men, Your Grace had not subdu'd a > more intire Slave; I assure you, Madam, there is neither Compliment, nor > Poetry, in this humble Declaration, but a Truth, which has cost me a great > deal of Inquietude, for that Fortune has not set me in such a Station, as > might justifie my Pretence to the honour and satisfaction of being ever near > Your Grace, to view eternally that lovely Person, and here that surprising > Wit; what can be more grateful to a Heart, than so great, and so agreeable, > an Entertainment? And how few Objects are there, that can render it so > entire a Pleasure, as at once to hear you speak, and to look upon your > Beauty? Hortense, however, maintained good relations with the king until his death. The Sunday before, the diarist John Evelyn wrote: > the King sitting and toying with his concubines, Portsmouth, Cleveland, and > Mazarin [Hortense Mancini being the Duchesse Mazarin]... Six days after, all > was in dust. ==After Charles II's death== Details of the painting Three Nieces of Cardinal Mazarin: Marie (left), Olympia (center), and Hortense (right) c. 1660s Following the death of Charles II, Hortense was well-provided for by James II, possibly because of her kinship with the new queen, Mary of Modena. Even when James fled England and William III and Mary II came to power, she remained in place, albeit with a much reduced pension. During this time, she presided over a salon of intellectuals. Charles de Saint-√âvremond, the great poet and epicurean, was a close friend and brought to her door all the learned men of London. Evelyn recorded her eventual death in 1699: > June 11th, 1699. Now died the famous Duchess of Mazarin. She had been the > richest lady in Europe; she was niece to Cardinal Mazarin, and was married > to the richest subject in Europe, as was said; she was born at Rome, > educated in France, and was an extraordinary beauty and wit, but dissolute, > and impatient of matrimonial restraint, so as to be abandoned by her > husband, and banished: when she came to England for shelter, lived on a > pension given her here, and is reported to have hastened her death by > intemperate drinking strong spirits. She has written her own story and > adventures, and so has her other extravagant sister, wife to the noble > family of Colonna. With the exception of Marguerite de Valois, Hortense and her sister, Marie Mancini, were the first women in France to put their memoirs into print. Both women were partly motivated by the help that producing a body of evidence would bring to the cause of separation from their abusive husbands. Hortense may have committed suicide. Her husband managed to continue the drama after her death; he carted her body around with him on his travels in France, before finally allowing it to be interred by the tomb of her uncle, Cardinal Mazarin. ==Descendants== Hortense's son, Paul Jules de La Porte, duc Mazarin et de La Meilleraye, had two surviving children. His daughter, Armande F√©lice de La Porte Mazarin (1691‚Äì1729), married Louis de Mailly, marquis de Nesle et de Mailly, Prince d'Orange in 1709. Through this marriage, she became the mother of five daughters, four of whom would become mistresses of King Louis XV of France: * Louise Julie de Mailly, Mademoiselle de Mailly, comtesse de Mailly (1710‚Äì1751), * Pauline F√©licit√© de Mailly, Mademoiselle de Nesle, marquise de Vintimille (1712‚Äì1741), * Diane Ad√©la√Øde de Mailly, Mademoiselle de Montcavrel, duchesse de Lauraguais (1714‚Äì1769), * Hortense F√©licit√© de Mailly, Mademoiselle de Chalon, marquise de Flavacourt (1715‚Äì1763), * Marie Anne de Mailly, Mademoiselle de Monchy, marquise de La Tournelle, duchesse de Ch√¢teauroux (1717‚Äì1744). The only one of the de Nesle sisters not to become one of Louis XV's mistresses was the marquise de Flavacourt. Louise Julie was the first sister to attract the king followed by Pauline F√©licit√©, but it was Marie Anne, the youngest and prettiest one, who was the most successful in manipulating him and becoming politically powerful. Armande F√©lice also had an illegitimate daughter, Henriette de Bourbon (1725‚Äì1780), Mademoiselle de Verneuil, from her relationship with the duc de Bourbon, the chief minister of Louis XV from 1723 to 1726. Paul Jules' son, Guy Jules Paul de La Porte, duc Mazarin et de La Meilleraye (1701‚Äì1738), married Louise Fran√ßoise de Rohan in 1716. Their great-granddaughter, Louise F√©licit√© Victoire d'Aumont, duchesse Mazarin et de La Meilleraye (1759‚Äì1826), married Honor√© IV, Prince of Monaco in 1777. From this marriage, the present Sovereign Princes of Monaco, including Prince Albert II of Monaco, are descended. ==References== ==Further reading== *Rosvall, Toivo David (1969) Mazarine Legacy: The Life of Hortense Mancini, Duchess Mazarin, Viking Press *Conway, Alison (2010) The Protestant Whore: Courtesan Narrative and Religious Controversy in England, 1680-1750, University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division *Goldsmith, Elizabeth (2012) The Kings' Mistresses: The Liberated Lives of Marie Mancini, Princess Colonna, and Her Sister Hortense, Duchess Mazarin, Public Affairs * Williams, H.

The Ashley River, as seen from Drayton Hall. Map of the Charleston Harbor watershed showing Ashley River. The Ashley River is a blackwater and tidal river in South Carolina, rising from the Wassamassaw and Great Cypress Swamps in western Berkeley County. It consolidates its main channel about five miles west of Summerville, widening into a tidal estuary just south of Fort Dorchester. The river then flows for approximately 17 miles along the historical banks of the City of North Charleston before reaching peninsular Charleston. The much wider Ashley joins the Cooper River off the Battery in Charleston to form Charleston Harbor before discharging into the Atlantic Ocean. the land around the Ashley River (or in Ashley Barony, as the original land grant was called) is mostly undeveloped. The river was named for Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury and chief Lord Proprietor of the Carolina Colony by explorer Robert Sandford.Robert Sandford, ‚ÄúA Relation of a Voyage on the Coast of the Province of Carolina, 1666,‚Äù in Salley, AS, ed [1911], 1967, ‚ÄúNarratives of Early Carolina, 1650-1708, Vol. 4 of ‚ÄúOriginal Narratives of Early American History,‚Äù Edited by J.

This settlement was the ‚Äúfirst permanent European settlement‚Äù in South Carolina and today Albemarle Point is known as Charles Towne Landing. The settlement would be moved to its current peninsular location across the river ten years later and is well known as Charleston. The land closest to the river was developed by plantation owners throughout the eighteenth century. During the Revolutionary War the British occupied the plantations from 1780 to 1782. The major crops grown along the Ashley River included rice, indigo, and cotton. After the Civil War much of the region began to be used predominately for hunting and tourism. The Ashley River area contains 26 separate sites listed in the National Register of Historic Places with 22 miles being designated a State Scenic River, extending from Sland's Bridge (US Highway 17-A) near Summerville to the Mark Clark expressway (I-526) bridge in Charleston. Within this segment, a visitor can experience a blackwater swamp, the tides of the Atlantic, and the history of South Carolina.

In the stage directions he is referred to as \\"Ghost\\". His name is also Hamlet, and he is referred to as King Hamlet to distinguish him from the Prince. He is loosely based on a legendary Jutish chieftain, named Horwendill, who appears in Chronicon Lethrense and in Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum. According to oral tradition, the Ghost was originally played by Shakespeare himself.Sylvan Barnet, \\"Shakespeare: An Overview,\\" in Macbeth, ed. Sylvan Barnet, A Signet Classic, 1998, p. ix. == In Hamlet == The Ghost appears three times in the play: in Act I, Scene i; in the continuum of Act I, Scenes iv and v; and Act III, Scene iv. The Ghost arrives at 1.00 a.m. in at least two of the scenes, and in the other scene all that is known is that it is night. The Ghost first appears to a duo of soldiers‚ÄîBernardo and Marcellus‚Äîand Hamlet's friend, Horatio. The men draw their swords and stand in fear, requesting that Horatio, as a scholar, address the Ghost. Horatio asks the Ghost to speak, and reveal its secret. It is about to do so when the cock crows, signalling morning, and the Ghost instead disappears. In this scene, the Ghost is clearly recognised by all present as the King, dressed in his full armour. Marcellus notes that the Ghost had appeared to the castle guards twice before. Talk of spectral visitations has unsettled the night watch. Francisco, who Bernardo relieves on guard duty says, \\"For this relief much thanks; 'tis bitter cold,/And I am sick at heart.\\"Egan, Maurice Francis. The Ghost in Hamlet and Other Essays in Comparative Literature. Chicago: A. C. McClurg & Co, 1906. pp. 11‚Äì47 Seeing the Ghost arrayed in a military aspect, and aware that the Norwegian crown prince Fortinbras is marshalling his forces on the frontier, Horatio recognises that the appearance of the Ghost must portend something regarding matters of state. Horatio then persuades Prince Hamlet into staying up with the guards to see if the Ghost returns. At midnight, it appears, and beckons Hamlet to follow. Once alone, the Ghost describes his wanderings on the earth, and his harrowing life in Purgatory, since he died without receiving last rites. He tells the young Hamlet that he was poisoned and murdered by his brother, Claudius, the new King of Denmark, and asks the prince to avenge his death. He also expresses disgust at his wife, Gertrude, for marrying Claudius, but warns Hamlet not to confront her, but to leave that to Heaven. Later, Prince Hamlet returns to his friends and has them swear on his sword to keep what they have seen a secret. When they resist, the Ghost utters the words \\"Swear\\" and \\"Swear on the sword\\", from below the stage, until his friends agree. Prince Hamlet, fearing that the apparition may be a demon pretending to be King Hamlet, decides to put the Ghost to the test by staging a play that re-enacts the circumstances that the spirit claims led to his death. Claudius' reaction is one of guilt and horror, and Prince Hamlet is convinced that the Ghost is, in fact, his father. In the third appearance, Hamlet is confronted by the Ghost in his mother's closet, and is rebuked for not carrying out his revenge and for disobeying his instruction by talking to Gertrude. Hamlet fearfully apologises. Gertrude, however, cannot see the Ghost, and thinks Hamlet is mad, asking why he stares and talks to nothing. In this scene, the Ghost is described as being in his nightgown. He is never mentioned again. King Hamlet is described by the few characters who mention him‚Äîbasically Hamlet, Horatio and the guards‚Äîas a warrior, as he led Denmark's forces to victory against Norway, and personally defeated its King Fortinbras in hand-to-hand combat. Hamlet respects him, saying Claudius pales in comparison to him, and frequently reflecting on him in an endearing manner. ==Interpretations== prompt book from an 1874 staging of Hamlet by English actor and manager Henry Irving (1838‚Äì1905), in which he experimented with using limelight (burning calcium oxide) to represent the ghost. The Ghost in Hamlet is fundamental to the plot, and has been the subject of a variety of interpretations. Shakespeare scholar W. W. Greg was of the opinion that the Ghost was a figment of Hamlet's overwrought imagination.Greg, W.W., \\"Hamlet's Hallucinations\\", Modern Language Review, XII, 1917, 393‚Äì421 Shakespeare scholar J. Dover Wilson and others have argued that in having the Ghost appear a number of times to others before appearing to Hamlet, Shakespeare makes clear that the apparition is not a mere illusion. ==Performances== About a hundred years after Shakespeare died, the poet Nicholas Rowe reported that he had heard an anecdote that Shakespeare himself had played the Ghost, starting a story that is still given credence. Modern actors who have portrayed the Ghost include Laurence Olivier,Barker, Felix (1953) The Oliviers (\\"...the actor playing the ghost [was] Olivier himself...\\" p259) Paul Scofield, Patrick Stewart,Interview with Sir Patrick Stewart and Brian Blessed. ==See also== *Ghosts in the arts *Ghost story ==References== ==External links== *The Importance of The Ghost in Hamlet (1910).

Over a period of many months a number of alternatives were negotiated with no result.

The party group in Brno (the biggest regional organisation) rejected the negotiated solution and asked for the resignation of Kalousek and of the whole presidium of KDU- ƒåSL. Other organisations made similar demands. Some members of parliament declared that they would refuse to support such a government. On the evening of the same day the country-wide committee of KDU-ƒåSL refused the proposal by an overwhelming majority and Kalousek resigned. He has claimed his negotiation with Ji≈ô√≠ Paroubek was part of a plan to prevent a government coalition of ƒåSSD and the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), which otherwise seemed to be the most likely scenario. That goal in fact came to pass when ODS refused to participate in a \\"grand coalition\\" and created its own government with minority support in the Parliament. In 2007, Kalousek was appointed as a Finance Minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Mirek Topol√°nek, a position he held until 2009 when Topol√°nek's cabinet lost a vote of no-confidence. In 2009, Kalousek and Karel Schwarzenberg co-founded a pro-European, center-right and conservative political party, TOP 09, that found success in the 2010 legislative election and the party formed a coalition government with the Civic Democrats (ODS) and Public Affairs (VV), a move that secured the Ministry of Finance for Kalousek for the second time.

In 2017, its population was 278,445 inhabitants in a total area of . Santa Maria is the 5th biggest municipality in the state, and the largest in its micro-region. Santa Maria is often referred to as the \\"heart of Rio Grande\\" (from Portuguese: \\"Cora√ß√£o do Rio Grande\\"), because the city is located in the geographical center of the State. ==History and Importance== The first inhabitants of Santa Maria were the Minuano Indigenous People, who lived in a region of the municipality known as Coxilha do Pau Fincado, and the Tapes, who lived in the hills. With the arrival of Spanish and Portuguese colonizers this border region was witness to innumerable battles between rival groups. Finally, in 1797 the border between the two colonies was established by a commission (1¬™ Subdivis√£o da Comiss√£o Demarcadora de Limites da Am√©rica dat lit Meridional). This commission set up camp on the site of present-day Santa Maria. The camp was known as Acampamento de Santa Maria, later adding Boca do Monte to the name. 1828 saw the arrival of the 28th Battalion of Foreigners, made up of hired Germans to fight against the inhabitants of present-day Uruguay in the Cisplatine War. After the war many of the soldiers decided to stay in Santa Maria, beginning the cycle of German colonization. In 1857, Santa Maria was separated from Cachoeira do Sul and elevated to town (vila) status. The municipality was created on 16 December 1857 and installed on 17 May 1858.Prefeitura Municipal de Santa Maria Since 1910, the city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Santa Maria, and annually hosts an important Roman Catholic festival dedicated to Nossa Senhora Medianeira, called \\"Romaria da Medianeira\\" (Medianeira or Mediatrix is a name of Our Lady that was created in Venice, Italy).

The chips were round, made of white corn and had an authentic \\"Mexican\\" flavor. Part of achieving this authenticity occurred after research discovered that Mexicans, after cooking corn with inorganic lime, did not rinse the corn completely and so the resulting stone-ground corn masa has a higher content of lime and lower pH. When the calcium hydroxide reacts with oil, it gives the chips this specific taste. After successful test marketing in 1979, Tostitos Traditional Flavor and Tostitos Nacho Cheese Flavor went into national distribution in 1980 in the United States and reached sales of $140 million, making it one of the most successful new product introductions in Frito-Lay history. The chips are often eaten with a dip like salsa or nacho cheese, both of which the company also produces. == Varieties == Tostitos white corn \\"Scoops\\" There are many varieties of Tostitos chips: * Tostitos Gold (and bite size Gold) - a thicker and larger version of the original, advertised to hold the thickest of dips; the bite size chips are smaller. Initially very popular, this variety has been quietly discontinued.Goodguide.com * Tostitos Hint of Jalape√±o - a version with jalape√±o pepper flavoring added. * Tostitos Hint of Lime - a version with lime flavoring added. * Tostitos Hint of Pepper Jack - a version with pepper jack cheese flavoring added. * Tostitos Spicy Quesadilla - artificial cheese and other spicy flavors added. * Tostitos Hint of Multigrain - a version with whole wheats and grains flavoring added. * Tostitos Flour Tortilla - made with flour (instead of just corn) for a milder flavor for dipping with a broader range of dips beyond Mexican-style dips (salsa, queso/cheese dip, etc.). * Tostitos Restaurant Style - A much larger triangular style chip, similar to what is used in traditional Mexican-style restaurants. Also available in Light, advertised to be made with olestra, reducing fat and calories. * Tostitos Scoops - a tortilla chip molded into the shape of a bowl that allows for easier scooping of salsas and dips. Also available in Baked, advertised to have half the fat of normal tostitos scoops.

There are several varieties of Cantina chips, including Cantina Thin & Crispy, and Cantina Traditional. *Tostitos Salsa Verde Some Frito-Lay brand seasoned products, including some flavors of Tostitos, contain pork enzymes in addition to herbs, cheese and other seasonings. Frito-Lay's web site states that they use enzymes from pigs (porcine enzymes) in some of their seasoned snack products to develop \\"unique flavors\\". The presence of pig-derived ingredients makes them unsuitable for vegetarians, vegans, as well as non-kosher and non-halal. ==Fiesta Bowl== Starting in 1995, Tostitos became the title sponsor of the Fiesta Bowl, one of the four American college football games that would make up the Bowl Championship Series, the former unofficial national championship of the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A). The game was played at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona through 2006 before moving to University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona in 2007. Following the 2006 season, Tostitos was the title sponsor for the BCS National Championship Game, a new game matching the number one and two teams in the final BCS standings. The title sponsor for the championship game rotated depending upon which site is hosting the 1 vs. 2 matchup.

Modern versions all share those common features. Traditionally, a bow saw is a woodworking tool used for straight or curved cuts. A bow saw is a type of frame saw. Its thin blade is held in tension by a frame. In English and American vocabulary it denotes a toothed blade suspended between two long narrow handles called \\"cheeks\\" that are supported and separated by a thin stretcher in the center of the handles, making a wide H shape (the cheeks form the uprights of the H, the stretcher the crossbar of the H). The blade is kept in tension with a turnbuckle or a twisted cord that runs parallel to the blade between the two cheeks but on the opposite side of the stretcher. If a cord is used, the cord is twisted with a toggle attached to one loop of the cord, adding tension. The toggle hits the stretcher, which keeps the cord from untwisting.

The earliest film selected was The 39 Steps (1935), and only two other 1930s films made the list. * David Lean, with seven films, is the most-represented director in the list, followed by Michael Powell (five films, of which four were collaborations with Emeric Pressburger). Powell and Pressburger (\\"The Archers\\") and John Schlesinger had four films each, while Alexander Mackendrick and Tony Richardson each had three. Seven of the films were produced by Ealing Studios during the years 1949‚Äì55. * The most-represented actor is Alec Guinness, with nine films, three being in supporting roles. Michael Caine is the most represented living actor, starring in seven films. * Julie Christie is the most represented actress, with six films on the list. ==Full list== { class=\\"sortable \\" - !

From the 1340s to the 19th century, excluding two brief intervals in the 1360s and the 1420s, the kings and queens of England (and, later, of Great Britain) also claimed the throne of France. The claim dates from Edward III, who claimed the French throne in 1340 as the sororal nephew of the last direct Capetian, Charles IV. Edward and his heirs fought the Hundred Years' War to enforce this claim, and were briefly successful in the 1420s under Henry V and Henry VI, but the House of Valois, a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty, was ultimately victorious and retained control of France. Despite this, English and British monarchs continued to prominently call themselves kings of France, and the French fleur-de-lis was included in the royal arms. This continued until 1801, by which time France no longer had any monarch, having become a republic. The Jacobite claimants, however, did not explicitly relinquish the claim. ==Overview== The title was first assumed in 1340 by Edward III of England, the Kingdom of England being ruled by the French Plantagenet dynasty at the time. Edward III claimed the throne of France after the death of his uncle Charles IV of France. At the time of Charles IV's death in 1328, Edward was his nearest male relative through Edward's mother Isabella of France. Since the election of Hugh Capet in 987, the French crown had always passed based on male-line relations (father to son until 1316). There was no precedent for someone succeeding to the French throne based on his maternal ancestry, nor had there been a need to. There had been no shortage of sons for more than three centuries from the inception of the House of Capet until the early 14th century, when new precedents concerning female inheritance finally had to be introduced. On the death of Philip IV the Fair's son Louis X in 1316, immediately followed by that of his son John I the Posthumous, it had to be decided whether his young daughter Joan or his brother Philip would succeed to the throne. Philip arranged for his coronation, and became Philip V of France. He was challenged by the supporters of the Princess Joan, daughter of Louis X, on the basis of his right to the throne. In response, he convened an assembly of prelates, barons, and burgesses at Paris, who acknowledged him as their lawful king, and declared that \\"Women do not succeed to the throne of France.\\" This was later said to have been based on the 5th century Salic law, but it is now known that the Salic Law was only rediscovered later and used by the lawyers of the Valois kings to fortify their masters' title with an additional aura of authenticity.. At the time of Charles's death in 1328, there was once again a dispute over the succession. Although it had come to be accepted that a woman could not possess the French throne in her own right, Edward III, the nephew of the deceased king and thus the nearest adult male relative, based his claim on the theory that a woman could transmit a right of inheritance to her son. This claim was rejected by French jurists under the principle Nemo plus juris ad alium transfere potest quam ipse habet (no one can transfer a greater right to another than he himself has), and the throne was given to the male line heir, Philip, Count of Valois, a first cousin of the deceased king. At the time, Edward paid homage to Philip VI for his Duchy of Aquitaine. In 1337, however, Edward, in his capacity as Duke of Aquitaine, refused to pay homage to Philip. The French king's response was to confiscate what was left of lands in English-held Aquitaine, namely Gascony, thus precipitating the Hundred Years' War and Edward's revival of his claim to the throne and title of King of France in 1340. The decision to assume the title of \\"King of France\\" was made at the solicitation of his Flemish allies, who had signed a treaty that they would no longer attack the French king. They said that if Edward took the French royal title, then the Flemish would be able to keep their honour, since they would not be attacking the \\"true King of France\\" (Edward III). Edward continued to use this title until the Treaty of Br√©tigny on 8 May 1360, when he abandoned his claims in return for substantial lands in France. After the resumption of hostilities between the English and the French in 1369, Edward resumed his claim and the title of King of France. His successors also used the title until the Treaty of Troyes on 21 May 1420, in which the English recognised Charles VI as King of France, but with his new son-in-law King Henry V of England as his heir (disinheriting Charles VI's son, the Dauphin Charles). Henry V then adopted the title Heir of France instead. Henry V and Charles VI died within two months of each other in 1422, and Henry V's infant son (Charles VI's grandson) Henry VI became King of France. He was the only English king who was de facto King of France, rather than using the style as a mere title of pretense. By 1429 Charles VII, with the support of Joan of Arc, had been crowned at Reims and begun to push the English out of northern France. In 1435, an end to the French civil war between Burgundians and Armagnacs allowed Charles to return to Paris the following year, and by 1453 the English had been driven out of their last strongholds in Normandy and Guyenne. The only French territory left to the English was Calais which they held until 1558. Nonetheless the kings and queens of England (and, later, of Great Britain) continued to claim the French throne for centuries, through the early modern period. The words \\"of France\\" was prominently included among their realms as listed in their titles and styles, and the French fleur-de-lys was included in the royal arms. This continued until 1801, by which time France had no monarch, having become a republic. ==Original claimants== ===\\"Kings of France\\" (1340)=== Arms of Edward III, with the English lions and the French fleur-de-lys. The arms of France are in the 1st and 4th quarter as France was considered the senior kingdom. *Edward III, King of England (reigned, first term 24 January 1340 ‚Äì 8 May 1360). ===\\"Kings of France\\" (title resumed 1369)=== Coat of arms of the kings of England after 1405, with the French quarterings updated to the modern French arms, three fleurs-de-lis on a blue field. *Edward III, King of England (reigned, second term 1369 ‚Äì 21 June 1377). *Richard II, King of England (reigned 21 June 1377 ‚Äì 29 September 1399). *Henry IV, King of England (reigned 30 September 1399 ‚Äì 20 March 1413). *Henry V, King of England (reigned 20 March 1413 ‚Äì 21 May 1420). ===Heir of France de jure (1420)=== *Henry V, King of England (term 21 May 1420 ‚Äì 31 August 1422) *Henry VI, King of England (term 31 August ‚Äì 21 October 1422). Succeeded as King of France upon the death of Charles VI, according to the Treaty of Troyes. Royal Arms of England during Henry VI's reign ===Kings of France (1422)=== *Henry VI, King of England (reigned, from England, 21 October 1422 ‚Äì 4 March 1461; 31 October 1470 ‚Äì 11 April 1471) was de jure king of France (although in reality only king of northern France) according to the Treaty of Troyes, ruling formally as Henry II of France (crowned at Paris, 16 December 1431). The English continued to hold significant portions of France until 1449, after which nearly all English-held territory was seized by his Capetian rival. That rival was the de facto king of southern France, Charles VII, who claimed the succession of his father in 1422, although he was not crowned until the recapture of Reims in 1429. After 1453, the only remaining English holding in France was Calais. Henry, though deposed in England by Edward IV on 4 March 1461, continued to be recognised as king by supporters of the House of Lancaster, and was briefly restored to the English throne in 1470. ==Rulers of Calais== Following a year-long episode of catatonia on the part of Henry VI of England in 1453 and the subsequent outbreak of the Wars of the Roses (1455‚Äì87), the English were no longer in any position to pursue their claim to the French throne and lost all their land on the continent, except for Calais. Calais was ruled by eight more English Kings and Queens of France until 1558: *Edward IV (4 March 1461 ‚Äì 30 October 1470; 11 April 1471 ‚Äì 9 April 1483). *Edward V (9 April ‚Äì 25 June 1483). *Richard III (26 June 1483 ‚Äì 22 August 1485). *Henry VII (22 August 1485 ‚Äì 21 April 1509). *Henry VIII (21 April 1509 ‚Äì 28 January 1547). *Edward VI (28 January 1547 ‚Äì 6 July 1553). *Jane (6/10 ‚Äì 19 July 1553), de facto monarch. *Mary I (19 July 1553 ‚Äì 7 January 1558). *Philip (jure uxoris; 25 July 1554 ‚Äì 7 January 1558). ==Tudor claimants== Ill feeling between the two nations continued well into the 16th century. Calais was captured by French troops under Francis, Duke of Guise on 7 January 1558. Mary and Philip continued, however, to be styled Queen and King of France for the rest of her reign, as did Mary I's half-sister and successor Elizabeth I, despite her abandonment of her claims to Calais in the Treaty of Cateau-Cambr√©sis of 1559. Elizabeth I revived England's claims to Calais and took the French port of Le Havre in 1561. French forces ejected the English in 1563, and the Treaty of Troyes (1564), recognised French ownership of Calais, in return for payment to England of 120,000 crowns. *Mary I and Philip of England (7 January ‚Äì 17 November 1558) *Elizabeth I of England (17 November 1558 ‚Äì 24 March 1603) ==Stuart dynasty claimants== Elizabeth died childless. Her successor was her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots‚Äô son James VI of Scotland. The thrones of England and Scotland were joined in a dynastic union until 1707. The seven monarchs of this period continued to use the style King/Queen of France, though their claim was merely nominal. None of them was willing to engage in military campaigns for France against the actual Kings of France Henry IV, Louis XIII and Louis XIV of France. Indeed, Charles I married a sister of Louis XIII, and his son Charles II spent much of his exile during the Interregnum in France (at which time, even if not formally abandoning his claim for its throne, he certainly did not emphasise it). *James I of England and VI of Scotland (24 March 1603 ‚Äì 27 March 1625). *Charles I of England and Scotland (27 March 1625 ‚Äì 30 January 1649). *Charles II of England and Scotland (30 January 1649 ‚Äì 6 February 1685). *James II of England and VII of Scotland (6 February 1685 ‚Äì 12 February 1689). *Mary II of England and Scotland (13 February 1689 ‚Äì 28 December 1694). *William III of England and II of Scotland (13 February 1689 ‚Äì 8 March 1702). *Anne of England and Scotland (8 March 1702 ‚Äì 1 May 1707). ==Claimants of Great Britain== The Act of Union 1707 declared the joining of the Kingdom of England with the Kingdom of Scotland to a new Kingdom of Great Britain. The Kingdom had four Monarchs until 1801. They also styled themselves Queen/King of France; however, none of them made any official move to depose Louis XIV and his successors, Louis XV and Louis XVI: *Anne, Queen of Great Britain (1 May 1707 ‚Äì 1 August 1714). *George I of Great Britain (1 August 1714 ‚Äì 11 June 1727). *George II of Great Britain (11 June 1727 ‚Äì 25 October 1760). *George III of Great Britain (25 October 1760 ‚Äì 31 December 1800). File:Coat of Arms of Great Britain (1714-1801).svgGeorge III coat of arms used from 1760 to 1801 as King of Great Britain, with the French fleurs-de-lys File:Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (1801-1816).svgGeorge III coat of arms used from 1801 to 1816 as King of the United Kingdom ==Ending the claim== The French Revolution overthrew and abolished the monarchy on 21 September 1792 and replaced it with the French Republic. In the War of the First Coalition British‚ÄìFrench negotiations were held in Lille from July to November 1797. The French demanded dropping the title; James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury was prepared to omit it from the king's signature to the envisaged peace treaty but had not conceded further by the time the talks collapsed.Cobbett 1818 cc.925‚Äì6; In the Commons' discussion of the negotiations, Sir John Sinclair called the demand \\"frivolous\\" and \\"hardly worth contending for\\";Cobbett 1818 c.988‚Äì9 William Pitt the Younger called the title \\"a harmless feather, at most, in the crown of England\\";Cobbett 1818 c.1009 French Laurence called it an \\"ancient dignity\\" the ceding of which would lose honour and bring disgrace.Cobbett 1818 c.1021 In 1800, the Act of Union joined the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland to a new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. George III chose this opportunity to drop his claim to the now defunct French throne, whereupon the fleurs de lis, part of the coat of arms of all claimant Kings of France since the time of Edward III, was also removed from the British royal arms. Britain recognised the French Republic by the Treaty of Amiens of 1802. The change was not acknowledged by Jacobite claimant Cardinal Henry Benedict Stuart. He continued to formally style himself King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland until his death on 13 July 1807. Although the fleurs-de-lys were completely removed from the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, they were later included in the arms of Canada, the British dominion, where they symbolise the heritage of the French Canadians, rather than the former British claim to the French throne. While the position of King of France was restored in 1814 (and later abolished for the final time in 1848) subsequent British monarchs did not pursue the claim to the French throne. ==Jacobite pretenders== The Jacobite pretenders were James II of England and his successors, continuing to style themselves \\"Kings of England, Scotland, France and Ireland\\" past their deposition in 1689. All four pretenders continued to actively claim the title King of France as well as that of King of England, Scotland and Ireland from 1689 until 1807: *James II and VII (12 February 1689 ‚Äì 16 September 1701). *James Francis Edward Stuart (16 September 1701 ‚Äì 1 January 1766), styled James III and VIII, also known as the Chevalier de St. George or as the Old Pretender. *Charles Edward Stuart (1 January 1766 ‚Äì 31 January 1788), styled Charles III, also known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, the Young Chevalier, or as the Young Pretender. *Henry Benedict Stuart (31 January 1788 ‚Äì 13 July 1807), styled Henry IX and I. James II for the last twelve years of his life and his son, the Old Pretender, until the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, were actually pensioners of Louis XIV at the very time they were claiming his title. ===Jacobite successors=== The Jacobite succession has continued since 1807 but none of the eight subsequent holders of the claims has actively pursued them. They continue to be customarily known as \\"King (or Queen) of France\\" by the Jacobites. *Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia (13 July 1807 ‚Äì 6 October 1819), descended from the youngest daughter of Charles I. *Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia (6 October 1819 ‚Äì 10 January 1824), his brother. *Maria Beatrice, Princess of Sardinia and later by marriage Duchess of Modena (10 January 1824 ‚Äì 15 September 1840), his daughter. *Francis V, Duke of Modena (15 September 1840 ‚Äì 20 November 1875), her son. *Maria Theresia, Princess of Modena and later Queen consort of Bavaria (20 November 1875 ‚Äì 3 February 1919), his niece. *Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria (3 February 1919 ‚Äì 2 August 1955), her son. *Albrecht, Duke of Bavaria (2 August 1955 ‚Äì 8 July 1996), his son. *Franz, Duke of Bavaria (since 8 July 1996), his son. The heir presumptive of the Jacobite claim is Franz's younger brother * Prince Max, Duke in Bavaria; then his daughter ** Sophie, Hereditary Princess of Liechtenstein; and then her eldest son *** Prince Joseph Wenzel of Liechtenstein, born 24 May 1995 in London ‚Äì the first heir in the Jacobite line born in the British Isles since James III and VIII, The Old Pretender, in 1688. ==Failed claimants== In addition two failed claimants to the throne of England were also styled King of France. They are usually omitted from regnal lists. *Lambert Simnel, impersonating Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick. Styled \\"Edward VI, King of England and France\\" (24 May ‚Äì 16 June 1487). Captured in the Battle of Stoke Field by Henry VII. *James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth. Styled \\"King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland\\" (20 June ‚Äì 6 July 1685). Captured after the Battle of Sedgemoor by James II/VII, and was subsequently beheaded for high treason. ==See also== *Mary, Queen of Scots & Francis II of France (Auld Alliance claim compounding the English claim) *Style of the British sovereign *Salic law *France ‚Äì United Kingdom relations *Franco-British union ==References== ===Sources=== * ===Citations=== ==External links== * .

The A-scan provides data on the length of the eye, which is a major determinant in common sight disorders. The most common use of the A-scan is to determine eye length for calculation of intraocular lens power. Briefly, the total refractive power of the emmetropic eye is approximately 60. Of this power, the cornea provides roughly 40 diopters, and the crystalline lens 20 diopters. When a cataract is removed, the lens is replaced by an artificial lens implant. By measuring both the length of the eye (A-scan) and the power of the cornea (keratometry), a simple formula can be used to calculate the power of the intraocular lens needed. There are several different formulas that can be used depending on the actual characteristics of the eye. All the information here is not valid for medical purposes. The other major use of the A-scan is to determine the size and ultrasound characteristics of masses in the eye, in order to determine the type of mass. This is often termed quantitative A-scan. Instruments used in this type of test require direct contact with the cornea, however a non-contact instrument has been reported. Disposable covers, which come in actual contact with the eye, have also been evaluated. ==See also== *B-scan ultrasonography *Ultrasonography ==References== *Santodomingo-Rubido, J.; Mallen, E.A.H.; Gilmartin, B.; and Wolffsohn, J.S.

Composed 1843, it was long used as an unofficial national anthem of the United States, in competition with other songs. Under the title \\"Three Cheers for the Red, White, and Blue,\\" the song is mentioned in Chapter IX of MacKinlay Kantor's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \\"Andersonville\\" (1955). It was also featured in the 1957 musical The Music Man. In 1969, \\"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean\\" was the music performed by a U.S. Navy Band embarked aboard USS Hornet as one of the ship's helicopters recovered the Apollo 11 astronauts from their capsule named Columbia after a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. The melody of \\"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean\\" is identical to that of the British patriotic song \\"Britannia, the Pride of the Ocean\\" and there is disagreement as to which song was adapted from the other. ==History== The origins and authorship of \\"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean\\" have been the source of some uncertainty. It is believed that Thomas A'Becket, Sr., a British musician and longtime resident of Philadelphia who performed at that city's Chestnut Street Theater, wrote the lyrics ‚Äì and possibly the melody ‚Äì at the request of David Shaw for the latter's performance at a benefit concert, probably in the autumn of 1843.Paul Holsinger, editor, War and American Popular Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, p. 67 That year, the copyright for the song was registered by the Philadelphia publishing house of George Willig under the name \\"Columbia, the Land of the Brave\\". Shaw subsequently published the song under his own name, though A'Becket later claimed sole authorship and presented an original handwritten composition as proof. The song invokes the historic informal name \\"Columbia\\" for the United States and borrows and modifies the phrase \\"land of the free and the home of the brave\\" from Francis Scott Key's earlier \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" as \\"the home of the brave and the free\\". \\"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean\\" with vocals, performed by the Robert Shaw Chorale (sample) ===\\"Britannia, the Pride of the Ocean\\"=== There has been some controversy as to whether \\"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean\\" is an appropriation of a similar, British patriotic song, \\"Britannia, the Pride of the Ocean\\" or whether the latter song is, in fact, an appropriation of \\"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean\\". Both songs have occasionally been referred to by the alternate name \\"The Red, White and Blue\\". In a 1919 analysis of the song's lyrics, Arthur Johnston stated that \\"Britannia, the Pride of the Ocean\\" had come first, \\"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean\\" being adapted from it. Johnston claimed that \\"the phrase, 'the service united' referred to the United Service Club, for which the song was written, the members of which belong both to the army and the navy\\". Johnston also opines that, to refer to the United States as \\"the gem of the ocean\\" would be \\"an absurdity\\" and the phrase more likely was an original reference to Great Britain. W. H. Grattan Flood also arrived at Johnston's conclusion of the British provenance of the song. He stated that Irish journalist Stephen Joseph Meany penned the lyrics to Britannia, the Pride of the Ocean in 1842 which he then showed to a friend in London, Thomas E. Williams, who composed the accompanying melody. In 1915 Flood recalled speaking to an elderly relative of his who claimed to have heard the song performed in Dublin in 1842 as a 12-year-old boy. However, the earliest printed version of either song was the 1843 copyright version registered by American George Willig. The first printed version of the song in the United Kingdom (\\"Brittania, the Pride of the Ocean\\") did not appear until 1852, in a filing with the British Museum by T.E. Purday. Further, that version credits the song to David Shaw. Additionally, Meany ‚Äì the Irishman whom Flood credits with the lyrics to \\"Britannia, the Pride of the Ocean\\" ‚Äì was a Fenian who would eventually be imprisoned by the British government. Citing the dates of printing, William Studwell concludes that \\"the song was probably created in the United States\\". ==Cultural use== According to William Studwell, \\"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean\\" is the \\"oldest well-known song of entirely American origin which could, by style or content, qualify as a national anthem\\". In the mid-1800s, \\"Columbia the Gem of the Ocean\\" vied with other songs in the American \\"Patriotic Big Five\\" (also including \\"Hail, Columbia\\", the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\", \\"Yankee Doodle\\", and \\"My Country Tis of Thee\\") for use as a national anthem, the United States at the time having no song officially designated as such. \\"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean\\" used as an interval signal during a 1962 Voice of America broadcast from Tangier, Morocco \\"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean\\" reached a height of popularity during the presidency of Abraham Lincoln and subsequently became a staple in the repertoire of the United States Marine Band. The tune was later used repeatedly by the composer Charles Ives, featuring notably in his Second Symphony (1897‚Äì1902) and Holiday Symphony (1897‚Äì1913) as well as in his Piano Sonata No. 2 (1911‚Äì15). In the 1957 musical The Music Man ‚Äì set in 1912 ‚Äì a full-cast rendition of \\"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean\\" is performed during the scene depicting the town's Independence Day celebration and, from the post-World War II era through to the 1960s, the first few chords of \\"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean\\" were used as an interval signal during Voice of America broadcasts, until ultimately replaced by \\"Yankee Doodle\\". During the recovery of the Apollo 11 astronauts after splashdown of the flight's command capsule (named Columbia) in the Pacific Ocean, President of the United States Richard Nixon ‚Äì then embarked aboard the aircraft carrier USS Hornet ‚Äì ordered the Band of the COMNAVAIRPAC (Commander, Naval Air Forces Pacific) to perform \\"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean\\". In the 1957 Charles Mingus album The Clown, the title track contains a narrative story spoken by Jean Shepherd about a clown - who suffers a fall from grace - having \\"a seal follow him up and down a step ladder blowing Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean on a B-flat Sears-Roebuck model 1322a plastic bugle. A real cute act.

Sometimes, it overlapped Upper Egypt stretching to the First and Second Cataracts (the region known to Greco-Roman geographers as Triakontaschoinos), so roughly until Aswan. A great deal of Upper Egypt and northern Lower Nubia were flooded with the construction of the Aswan High Dam and the creation of Lake Nasser. However the intensive archaeological work conducted prior to the flooding means that the history of the area is much better known than that of Upper Nubia. Its history is also known from its long relations with Egypt. ==History== Lower Nubia lies mainly between the first and second cataracts with some historical overlappings. During the Middle Kingdom Lower Nubia was occupied by Egypt, when the Egyptians withdrew during the First Intermediate Period Lower Nubia seems to have become part of the Upper Nubian Kingdom of Kerma. The New Kingdom occupied all of Nubia and Lower Nubia was especially closely integrated into Egypt, but with the Second Intermediate Period it became the centre of the independent state of Kush based at Napata at some point. Perhaps around 591 BC the capital of Kush was transferred south to Meroe and Lower Nubia became dominated by the Island of Meroe. With the fall of the Meroitic Empire in the fourth century AD the area became home to X-Group, also known as the Ballana culture who were likely the Nobatae. This evolved into the Christian state of Nobatia by the fifth century. Nobatia was merged with the Upper Nubian state of Makuria, but Lower Nubia became steadily more Arabized and Islamicized and eventually became de facto independent as the state of al-Maris. Most of Lower Nubia was formally annexed by Egypt during the Ottoman conquest of 1517, and it has remained a part of Egypt since then, with only the south being Sudan. ==Language== Linguistic evidence indicates that Cushitic languages were spoken in Lower Nubia, an ancient region which straddles present day Southern Egypt and part of Northern Sudan, and that Nilo-Saharan languages were spoken in Upper Nubia to the south (by the peoples of the Kerma culture), with North Eastern Sudanic languages from Upper Nubia later replacing the Cushitic languages of Lower Nubia. Julien Cooper (2017) states that in antiquity, Cushitic languages were spoken in Lower Nubia (located in the northernmost part of modern day Sudan): > \\"In antiquity, Afroasiatic languages in Sudan belonged chiefly to the phylum > known as Cushitic, spoken on the eastern seaboard of Africa and from Sudan > to Kenya, including the Ethiopian Highlands.\\" Julien Cooper (2017) states that in antiquity, Cushitic languages were spoken in Lower Nubia (the northernmost part of modern day Sudan): > \\"In antiquity, Afroasiatic languages in Sudan belonged chiefly to the phylum > known as Cushitic, spoken on the eastern seaboard of Africa and from Sudan > to Kenya, including the Ethiopian Highlands.\\" Julien Cooper (2017) also states that Eastern Sudanic speaking populations from southern and west Nubia gradually replaced the earlier Cushitic speaking populations of this region: > \\"In Lower Nubia there was an Afroasiatic language, likely a branch of > Cushitic. By the end of the first millennium CE this region had been > encroached upon and replaced by Eastern Sudanic speakers arriving from the > south and west, to be identified first with Meroitic and later migrations > attributable to Nubian speakers.\\" In Handbook of Ancient Nubia, Claude Rilly (2019) states that Cushitic languages once dominated Lower Nubia along with the Ancient Egyptian language. Rilly (2019) states: > \\"Two Afro-Asiatic languages were present in antiquity in Nubia, namely > Ancient Egyptian and Cushitic.\\" Rilly (2019) mentions historical records of a powerful Cushitic speaking race which controlled Lower Nubia and some cities in Upper Egypt. Rilly (2019) states: > \\"The Blemmyes are another Cushitic speaking tribe, or more likely a > subdivision of the Medjay/Beja people, which is attested in Napatan and > Egyptian texts from the 6th century BC on.\\" On page 134: > \\"From the end of the 4th century until the 6th century AD, they held parts > of Lower Nubia and some cities of Upper Egypt.\\" He mentions the linguistic relationship between the modern Beja language and the ancient Cushitic Blemmyan language which dominated Lower Nubia and that the Blemmyes can be regarded as a particular tribe of the Medjay: > \\"The Blemmyan language is so close to modern Beja that it is probably > nothing else than an early dialect of the same language. In this case, the > Blemmyes can be regarded as a particular tribe of the Medjay.\\" In Upper Egypt and Northern Lower Nubia was present a series of cultures, the Badarian, Amratian, Gerzean, A-Group, B-Group, and C-Group. Linguistic evidence indicates that Cushitic languages were spoken in Lower Nubia, an ancient region which straddles present day Southern Egypt and Northern Sudan, before the arrival of North Eastern Sudanic languages in the Middle Nile Valley.Cooper, Julien (2017) \\"Toponymic Strata in Ancient Nubia Until the Common Era,\\" Dotawo: A Journal of Nubian Studies: Vol. 4 , Article 3.

It was first created as an independent township in 1974 through the amalgamation of Mount Hope, Binbrook, Glanford, and other nearby communities. In 2001, Glanbrook became a dissolved municipality after it was amalgamated with Hamilton, Stoney Creek, Dundas, Ancaster and Flamborough to become the present city of Hamilton. The population of Glanbrook as of the 2006 census was 15,293, a 25% increase from the 2001 census figure of 12,145, and making it the fastest growing part of Hamilton. It contains the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport. ==History== ===Before 1938=== Glanford Township highlighted in green on an 1818 map Glanford and Binbrook Townships were surveyed as part of Upper Canada in the 1790s, and originally formed part of Lincoln County. They became part of Wentworth County when the latter was created in 1816. After being deforested by pioneer settlers, Glanbrook was suitable for grain cultivation and mixed agriculture. However, its harsher climate did not make it nearly as suitable for growing fruit as its counterparts on the Niagara Peninsula. A local married couple gained fame in a popular song in the 19th century. Margaret \\"Maggie\\" Clark was born in Glanford Township in 1841. She was taught at public school by George W. Johnson, who was born in Binbrook Township in 1839.George W. Johnson They married in 1864, but she died shortly after of typhus. In 1866, Johnson had his friend J.C. Butterfield and a poem about his now deceased wife he published around the time of his marriage to music. \\"When You and I Were Young, Maggie\\" was debuted by his sister-in-law, and became popular worldwide.\\"When You and I Were Young, Maggie\\" Johnson remarried twice and died in 1917. Due to the barrier presented by the Niagara Escarpment, settlement was slower and sparser than that of its neighbours to the north in Saltfleet and Barton Townships (later Stoney Creek and Hamilton). Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the townships remained placid agrarian backwaters, far removed from the bustling heavy industry growing only a dozen miles away in Hamilton. Politically, the townships‚Äô local governments were neither active nor intrusive nor controversial. As part of the Wentworth (and later Wentworth East) provincial and federal ridings, voters in the townships helped elect largely non-descript and conservative members of the Ontario legislature and Canadian parliament. ===1939-1974=== During the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Air Force built an airfield in Glanford Township. It opened in 1940 to as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, and successively hosted Nos. 10 Elementary Flying Training School, 33 Air Navigation School and 1 Wireless School. The graves of 13 Britons and a Jamaican are still maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in the churchyard where they were buried. After a long, gradual decline in its military use, the RCAF Station Mount Hope was declared surplus and the airport was wholly given over to civil aviation in 1963. It developed slowly in fits and starts as a cargo, light aircraft, charter, regional commuting and international airport. Since 1971, a dam at Binbrook Conservation Area near the source of the Welland River has created a reservoir to control flooding downstream. The conservation area is operated by the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority, and hence the reservoir is called Lake Niapenco. Binbrook Conservation Area offers opportunities for fishing, boating, hiking and birding. In 1974, the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth was created. Glanford and Binbrook were amalgamated to form the Township of Glanbrook as one of the region's six second tier municipalities which were responsible for such things as fire services. ===1975-2019=== Beginning in the early 1970s, a small group of enthusiastic volunteers with an interest in military aviation history helped create Canadian Warplane Heritage. Their small collection of Second World War-era aircraft flew at such events as the Canadian National Exhibition Air Show in Toronto and the Hamilton International Air Show. As the CWH's warplane collection grew, the first paid employees were hired and it expanded to occupy two hangars at Mount Hope Airport. Unfortunately, in 1993, a fire there destroyed five aircraft including a rare Spitfire and Hurricane of the Victory Flight, but sparing a Lancaster. The airport itself was privatized in 1995. The following year, aided by provincial grants, a replacement hangar for the CWH was built and a proper static museum opened on the site. The airport was renamed for John Munro, former MP for Hamilton East and a former transport minister, in 1998. In 2001, over the vocal objections of most of its 10,000 inhabitants and its elected representatives, Glanbrook was amalgamated with Stoney Creek, Dundas, Flamborough, Ancaster and Hamilton to form the new City of Hamilton. ==References== ==External links== * Glanbrook Conservation Committee ecological group Category:Former township municipalities in Ontario Category:Neighbourhoods in Hamilton, Ontario Category:Niagara Escarpment Category:Populated places disestablished in 2001 ","title":"Glanbrook, Hamilton, Ontario"},{"id":"1428713","text":"Leomil may refer to: *Leomil (Almeida), a civil parish in the municipality of Almeida *Leomil (Moimenta da Beira), a civil parish in the municipality of Moimenta da Beira ","title":"Leomil"},{"id":"1428718","text":"Blood and Chocolate is a 1997 paranormal romance novel for young adult readers by Annette Curtis Klause. It is set in the contemporary United States. ==The Loups-garoux== In Klause's novel, the loup-garoux are a separate species from humans and wolves, but with elements of both in behavior and anatomy - referring to themselves as Homo lupus. There are two differing accounts of their origins alluded to in the book; some believe they are descended from a prehistoric breed of canine which absorbed protean matter from a meteorite which enabled them to shape-shift into humans, others that they were a tribe of ancient human hunters blessed by the moon goddess Selene. Most loup-garoux follow the latter account and thus worship Selene as their patron and mother. Loups-garoux are portrayed as glorious beasts who revel in their dual nature, but do not reveal this truth to humans at the risk of violent backlash. In keeping with the traditional werewolf lore, silver is poisonous when introduced into the bloodstream, often proving fatal, and death is a real danger in that \\"anything that will sever the spine will do\\". Loup-garou is the French word for \\"werewolf\\". Its plural form is loups-garous. A faux-French plural could be loups-garoux. ==Synopsis== Vivian is a sixteen-year-old loup- garoux who has just started high school in a new town, she explains the circumstances that brought her there; formerly, she and her pack lived in another town, the teenage pack members started to become more feral, using their wolf forms to scare humans, one day, a loup-garoux named Axel lost control, killed a human girl and was witnessed changing back from wolf to human form. While Axel was in prison, the other teenage loups-garoux killed another human to make it look like the \\"real\\" killer was still on the loose and Axel was released. Vivian's father, the pack leader, killed Axel for endangering the pack, but Vivian pleaded with him to spare the lives of the other teenagers. Not long after, suspicious neighbors set fire to the pack's house. Vivian's father and a few others were killed, and the pack had to relocate. In the new town, Vivian has no friends because of her reserved and secretive nature; many girls she attends school with find her intimidating and are jealous of her beauty. However, she is intrigued by a boy named Aiden who has written a poem about werewolves that is surprisingly accurate with regards to their transformation. She at first suspects Aiden might be a werewolf himself, but soon figures out that he is a pure-blooded human. She is still attracted to him and pursues a relationship with him, despite her mother, Esm√©'s disapproval. Esm√© doesn't want Vivian to date a human and fears that Vivian might reveal the secret of the pack. Meanwhile, the pack is restless in their new location, and the pack's five teenage males - Rafe, Finn, Willem, Ulf and Gregory - are getting out of control. Rafe's father, Lucien, has a drinking problem. To Vivian's embarrassment, her mother and Ulf's mother, Astrid are constantly fighting over a 24-year-old man named Gabriel, even though both women are in their 40s with teenage children. Vivian dislikes Gabriel because he seems the most likely candidate to take over her father's position as alpha male; furthermore, Gabriel is attracted to Vivian and doesn't listen to her rejections. He often visits Esm√©'s house, but really it is with the intention of seeing Vivian. This seems to drive Vivian closer to Aiden. When Astrid, Lucien and a few other pack members run around near the suburbs in their wolf skins, it becomes evident that the pack badly needs a leader. Since there is no agreement over who it should be, they decide to elect the leader via Ordeal; a free-for-all brawl where any male who is of age can participate, anyone who has blood drawn is disqualified, and the last two can fight to the death or if one surrenders to the other. Afterwards, the pack females will participate in the Bitch's Dance, a fight to determine who will be the new leader's mate. Gabriel wins the Ordeal and Astrid instantly attacks Esm√©, seemingly with the intent to kill. Without realizing what she's doing, Vivian leaps in to save her mother's life, she seriously wounds Astrid, taking out one of her eyes. After defeated Astrid, Vivian is declared the alpha female and Gabriel's mate; horrified, Vivian runs back to her home, terrified of being both the alpha female and Gabriel's mate. The next day, Gabriel declares that he'll wait as long as Vivian needs, but eventually she'll come around to him. The rest of the pack agrees with Gabriel's assessment. However, Vivian is stubborn and continues to reject Gabriel while pursuing Aiden with even more effort. Vivian and Aiden are close to the point where they might have sex and she decides she wants him to know the truth about her before they get intimate. She reveals her beast form to Aiden; he crouches in a corner in fear and starts to throw things at her to chase her away. Hurt and afraid of losing her self-control, she jumps out of his window and into the night. Vivian wakes up in her own bed the next morning, with human blood on her nails and no memory of what happened after revealing herself to Aiden. Later on, she sees a tv news story about a man who has been killed by a \\"wild animal.\\" Vivian starts experimenting with alcohol and in the following days she tries to get Aiden alone to explain what she is and ease his fears, but he avoids her and uses his human friends as buffers. In an attempt to get Aiden back, she attends a concert that they had planned to attend together, but his friends confront her with the lies that Aiden told them were the reason he broke up with her. Shocked and hurt that he would say such awful things about her, Vivian breaks down, whereupon Gabriel suddenly appears and takes Vivian home. Gabriel tries to comfort her, hinting that he once revealed himself to a human and like her, came to regret it. Another murder occurs. Again, Vivian wakes up with no memory of the incident, but finds a human hand on the floor of her bedroom. Convinced that she is the murderer, Vivian decides to commit suicide for the sake of the pack. She douses herself in kerosene, but before she can light the match, she is apprehended by Gabriel, Willem and Ulf. Ulf admits that his mother, Astrid and her new lover, Rafe were setting Vivian up for the murders: Astrid still holds a grudge against Vivian for winning Gabriel and ripping out her eye in the process and, Rafe was mad at her for dating a human instead of him. They committed the murders and planted the blood on Vivian, knowing she was experiencing a great deal of stress from keeping her wolf nature controlled around Aiden. Aiden sends Vivian a note asking her to meet him \\"for the sake of what we used to have.\\" Vivian realizes that Astrid and Rafe must have found the note, which was carried by Aiden's friend and the killers' latest victim. Vivian goes to meet Aiden and try to get him out of danger, while Gabriel, Willem and Ulf go to gather the pack so they can be there when Judgment is passed on Astrid. When Vivian gets to the meeting place, Aiden points a gun at her, explaining he has a silver bullet made from his pentagram necklace. Vivian tries to explain that she isn't the killer, but since Aiden doesn't know there are other werewolves, he refuses to believe her. Just as he's about to shoot her, Astrid and Rafe show up in their hybrid forms, Astrid says that they're going to kill both Aiden and Vivian, and pretend they \\"did what they had to do.\\" She also explains that it's mainly because of her grudge over Gabriel that she wanted to do this to Vivian. Rafe didn't realize that she meant to kill Vivian and he's hurt when she mentions she wanted Gabriel and, the two of them start arguing. In the middle of it, Vivian tells Aiden to shoot Rafe while she leaps for Astrid. Aiden's shot works and Rafe falls dead. Just as Vivian and Astrid's fight start to get serious, Gabriel steps in and two other pack members apprehend Astrid. Gabriel explains that they have no prisons and no jailers; there is only one sentence for endangering the pack. He snaps Astrid's neck, killing her. Aiden is terrified from seeing so many werewolves and shoots at Gabriel, but Vivian leaps in front to take the bullet. Gabriel forbids Aiden from ever coming into contact with Vivian or any other pack member and, says that they will watch him for the rest of his life to ensure he never tells anyone about the pack; Aiden runs away in terror. The pack's healer manages to get the bullet out of Vivian, but she ends up stuck in her hybrid form, neither human nor wolf and unable to fully change into either one. Two weeks later, Gabriel enters Vivian's bedroom, where she is grieving being trapped between forms as well as her heartache, he finally tells her his story - that he had once loved a human woman and like Vivian, had been convinced that she would accept and love him regardless of what he was. He admits that when he had been making love to the human woman he had to suppress the urge to shift and says that dating humans isn't merely inadvisable - it is impossible and dangerous. Gabriel accidentally shifted in front of his human girlfriend and when both panicked, he accidentally killed her. Gabriel's raw sadness and honesty makes Vivian realize that she had been in love with the idea of Aiden's acceptance of her, not because he was the mate that she needed. Vivian and Gabriel share a kiss and, Vivian is finally able to transform again. Gabriel takes Vivian outside for the first time in days and they run off into the woods together in their wolf forms - a black and silver wolf respectively. Vivian accepts her place in the pack as alpha female and Gabriel's mate and, reflects on the joy she has in being a werewolf and having someone who now finally and completely understands her. ==Awards and nominations== Blood and Chocolate won the 1998 YALSA Award for Best Books for Young Adults. ==Film adaptation== The novel was adapted into a film in 2007 and released January 26. By the end of its run, a little over two months later, the film had grossed $3,526,847 domestically and $2,784,270 overseas for a worldwide total of $6,311,117. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 11% rating based on 63 reviews. On Metacritic, the film has a 33 out of 100 rating from 16 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Very little of Klause's original storyline, characters and plot points are maintained in the adaptation. This has often led to criticism from the fans of the novel that the film's director and production team took too many artistic liberties with the source material. ===Variation From Novel=== The film adaptation is significantly different from the book in many aspects. All characters are portrayed as older than the novel versions, Vivian and Aiden are scaled up to be 19 years old and Gabriel is portrayed to be in his late 30s. In the film Vivian's background story is drastically changed including the death of her family, in the film Esm√© does not appear. Rafe is also made to be Gabriel's and Astrid's son rather than the temporary love interest of Astrid. Both Gabriel and the pack as a whole are portrayed drastically different. Gabriel is depicted as a cruel, harsh and aggressive alpha of the pack who has set his sights on Vivian as his next \\"mate\\" according to a tradition in the pack for the leader to take a new mate every few years. Reasons behind this change were not explained. In the film Gabriel is the main antagonist who delights in directing his pack to ritualistically hunt down and kill humans every full moon - he orders Aiden to be hunted by the pack for having a relationship with Vivian. Additionally in the movie the relationship between Aiden and Vivian has a drastically different outcome. Instead Aiden discovers the existence of werewolves from Rafe, not Vivian and he does not reject her for what she is. After rescuing Aiden from being hunted by the pack they take off to hide, heal Vivian from the silver poison and escape the city as well as the pack and start a life together elsewhere. In the end of the film Aiden and Vivian end up together after killing Gabriel together and flee the city - the future of the pair and whether Vivian takes place as alpha is hinted at but uncertain. ==References== Category:1997 American novels Category:Werewolf novels Category:American young adult novels Category:American fantasy novels adapted into films Category:American romance novels Category:Novels set in Maryland Category:1997 British novels Category:British novels adapted into films ","title":"Blood and Chocolate (novel)"},{"id":"1428721","text":"Blood & Chocolate is the eleventh studio album by the British rock singer and songwriter Elvis Costello, released in the United Kingdom as Demon Records XFIEND 80, and in the United States as Columbia 40518. After his previous album King of America with producer T-Bone Burnett and different musicians, this album reunited him with producer Nick Lowe and his usual backing group the Attractions. It peaked at No. 16 on the UK Albums Chart, and No. 84 on the Billboard 200.The Billboard 200 20 December 1986 The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In 2000 it was voted number 475 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. The recording of Blood & Chocolate was troubled, as the relationship between Costello and the Attractions had deteriorated during sessions for King of America. The album was recorded at concert level volume in a way Costello felt suited the material. ==Background and recording== Six months after the Los Angeles sessions for King of America, Costello returned to the studio with the Attractions to work on the songs for this album.Costello, Elvis. Blood & Chocolate. Rhino Records R2 78355, 2002, liner notes, p. 5. Costello reported the band's relationship as having 'soured', and after the album's completion and one more tour, Costello would not work again with the Attractions for another eight years until Brutal Youth.Costello, p. 12. Costello explained, \\"It was recorded just over six months after the Hollywood sessions for King of America. The Attractions' sole contribution to that album, 'Suit of Lights,' had been made during our least successful and most bad-tempered days in the studio. The air of suspicion and resentment still lingered as King of America was released and we entered Olympic Studios, London, to make what proved to be our last record together for eight years\\". Recording at Olympic Studios in London, several songs were re-workings from those earlier L.A. sessions, including \\"Blue Chair\\", \\"I Hope You're Happy Now\\", and \\"American Without Tears No. 2\\". An outtake from these sessions, a cover of the 1959 hit by Little Willie John \\"Leave My Kitten Alone\\", had also been an outtake for the Beatles during the sessions for Beatles for Sale. Blood & Chocolate was recorded in a single large room at high volume, with the band listening to each other on monitor speakers and playing at stage volume, an unusual practice in the studio for its time.Costello, p. 6. As Costello recalled, \\"Nick Lowe was producing us for the first time in five years and together with engineer Colin Fairley, agreed to an approach that would get the music recorded before the band and I fell out completely. Olympic's control room still contained some of the Bakelite switches and other arcane features left over from the days when it had hosted sessions by Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones. The live room was big enough for a full orchestra, so we filled it with our live monitor system and played at something approaching stage volume. Although it is commonly thought that high volume in the studio creates an uncontrollable sonic picture, this approach seemed to suit the material entirely\\". ==Packaging== As on his previous album, Costello uses three different names to credit himself: his given name of Declan MacManus; his stage name of Elvis Costello; and the nickname Napoleon Dynamite, his alter ego as master of ceremonies for the Attractions' spinning songbook tour.Costello, p. 4. The name \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" would later be used for a 2004 cult film by Jared Hess, who denies that the title was inspired by Blood & Chocolate. The album uses Esperanto to list musician credits and LP sides. The line in Tokyo Storm Warning \\"Japanese God-Jesus robots telling teenage fortunes\\" refers to a real toy made by Bandai.photo of toy on Engrish.com. Accessed on 12/13/10. Elvis Costello created the cover of the album himself. ==Release== The album was released initially on vinyl, CD and cassette in 1986, with a reissue, courtesy of Rykodisc Records in the U.S. and Demon Records in the U.K., arriving nine years later with six bonus tracks, including the 1987 single version of \\"Blue Chair\\" recorded during the King of America sessions. A 10,000 copy limited edition version of this release came with a bonus disc entitled An Overview Disc, consisting of a 78-minute interview with Peter Doggett, conducted on 21 July 1995, in which Costello and Doggett discuss his career and releases up to 1986. Five of the six Rykodisc bonus tracks, minus \\"A Town Called Nothing\\", along with ten others appeared as the second disc to the double-disc Rhino Records reissue in 2002. These reissues are out of print, the album was reissued again by Universal Music Group after its acquisition of Costello's complete catalogue in 2006. The tracks \\"Tokyo Storm Warning\\", \\"I Want You\\", and \\"Blue Chair\\" were all released as singles. The \\"Blue Chair\\" single was not the recording from the album, but an earlier one made with T-Bone Burnett during the King of America sessions with the Confederates band. \\"Tokyo Storm Warning\\" peaked at No. 73 on the UK Singles Chart but missed the Billboard Hot 100. The other two singles did not chart in either nation. Except for a compilation released in the UK, Out of Our Idiot, this album would be the final release on his Demon/Columbia contract, Costello signing with Warner Brothers for his next LP, Spike. The UK CD included an alternative mix of \\"Uncomplicated\\" which \\"lacks the anvil sound after the 'horse that knows arithmetic' line and a guitar part from the guitar break near the end\\". This version is also available on the CD-only release of Girls + Girls + Girls. == Content == === Musical style === Will Birch likened the record's sound to the then-embryonic grunge style, proclaiming it to be \\"six or eight years ahead of its time\\". Similarly, Blood & Chocolate was illustrated by Goldmine Magazine as a \\"brash, grungy\\" effort on 7 April 1989, and in September 2007 as \\"ferocious and grungy\\" by Q Magazine. AllMusic cataloged Blood & Chocolate a \\"straight-ahead rock & roll\\" album, while acknowledging lesser elements of folk and country. === Lyrical themes === Alluding to Blood & Chocolate's lyrical content, Blender detailed \\"blistering songs about sexual despair and disgust\\". == Critical reception == In a 4 out-of 5 star AllMusic review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine lauded Blood & Chocolate \\"lively\\" and \\"frequently compelling\\". Blood & Chocolate was graded A- by Armond White of Entertainment Weekly in 1991, and praised as a \\"blistering\\" and \\"wildly infectious\\" effort. ==Track listing== All tracks written by Declan MacManus (Elvis Costello) except as noted; track timings taken from Rhino 2002 reissue. ===1995 bonus tracks=== # \\"Seven Day Weekend\\" (with Jimmy Cliff) (Costello, Cliff) ‚Äì 2:39 released on the soundtrack to Club Paradise # \\"Forgive Her Anything\\" ‚Äì 3:51 session outtake # \\"Blue Chair\\" ‚Äì 3:41 single version # \\"Baby's Got a Brand New Hairdo\\" ‚Äì 3:26 b-side to the \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\" single # \\"American Without Tears No. 2\\" ‚Äì 3:35 twilight version released as b-side to the \\"Blue Chair\\" single # \\"A Town Called Big Nothing (Really Big Nothing)\\" ‚Äì 5:44 session outtake # \\"Return to Big Nothing\\" ‚Äì 2:54 unlisted track ===2002 bonus disc=== Tracks 1‚Äì6 are session outtakes; tracks 11‚Äì15 are solo demo recordings. # \\"Leave My Kitten Alone\\" (Little Willie John, James McDougal, Titus Turner) ‚Äì 3:24 # \\"New Rhythm Method\\" ‚Äì 2:30 # \\"Forgive Her Anything\\" ‚Äì 3:51 different take to the 1995 reissue version # \\"Crimes of Paris\\" ‚Äì 4:38 # \\"Uncomplicated\\" ‚Äì 3:06 # \\"Battered Old Bird\\" ‚Äì 4:24 # \\"Seven Day Weekend\\" (with Jimmy Cliff) (Costello, Cliff) ‚Äì 2:39 released on the soundtrack to Club Paradise # \\"Blue Chair\\" ‚Äì 3:41 single version # \\"Baby's Got a Brand New Hairdo\\" ‚Äì 3:26 b-side to the \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\" single # \\"American Without Tears No. 2\\" ‚Äì 3:35 twilight version released as b-side to the \\"Blue Chair\\" single # \\"All These Things\\" (Allen Toussaint) ‚Äì 3:04 # \\"Pouring Water on a Drowning Man\\" (Drew Baker, Dani McCormick) ‚Äì 2:35 # \\"Running Out of Fools\\" (Richard Ahlert, Kay Rogers) ‚Äì 2:35 # \\"Tell Me Right Now\\" (Joe Tex) ‚Äì 3:06 # \\"Lonely Blue Boy\\" (Ben Weisman, Fred Wise) ‚Äì 2:04 ==Personnel== * Elvis Costello ‚Äì electric guitar, acoustic guitar, vocals, harmonium, tambourine, bellows, canes, knives, bass, Vox Continental electric organ * Steve Nieve ‚Äì piano, organ, harmonium * Bruce Thomas ‚Äì bass, electric guitar, saxophone * Pete Thomas ‚Äì drums, alto saxophone ===Additional personnel=== * Nick Lowe ‚Äì acoustic guitar * Cait O'Riordan ‚Äì vocals on \\"Crimes of Paris\\" and \\"Poor Napoleon\\" * Jimmy Cliff ‚Äì vocals on \\"Seven Day Weekend\\" * Mitchell Froom ‚Äì organ on \\"Blue Chair\\" single version * Tom \\"T-Bone\\" Wolk ‚Äì electric guitar, bass on \\"Blue Chair\\" single version * Mickey Curry ‚Äì drums on \\"Blue Chair\\" single version ==Cover versions== Los Lobos covered \\"Uncomplicated\\" on their 2004 EP Ride This.

Population: 34,000 (1970). ==History== The town was founded in 1152 by Prince Yury Dolgoruky (also the founder of Moscow) as a large fortress on the Volga River, the first Russian fortress in today's Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. It was a starting point for numerous campaigns of the princes of Vladimir and Suzdal against Volga Bulgaria. In 1216, Yury II of Vladimir was dethroned by his brother and exiled here. In 1239, the town was burned to the ground by Batu Khan's army. Folk tradition identifies Gorodets with Little Kitezh, a legendary town destroyed by the Mongols. In 1263, Alexander Nevsky died in Gorodets on his way back to Novgorod from the Golden Horde. His son, Andrey, made the town his chief residence. A famous medieval icon-painter, Prokhor, was born there. In the mid-14th century, the town was overshadowed by the neighboring Nizhny Novgorod but continued as the third largest town of Nizhny Novgorod Principality until 1408, when Edigu razed it to the ground. For two following centuries the town was known as Gorodets Pustoy (i. e., \\"Gorodets the Empty\\"). Some chronicles state that its entire population moved slightly downstream and resettled at Salt-on-Gorodets (today's Balakhna). By the 19th century, Gorodets was revived as a prosperous village settled by Old Believer merchants and reputed for its decorative handicrafts, such as wood carving and painting. In 1875, the Nizhny Novgorod writer A. S. Gatsisky described Gorodets as a major center of trade in grain and wooden kitchenware.A Guide to Nizhny Novgorod and Nizhny Novgorod Fair Alexander Gatsisky, 1875. In 1922, Gorodets becomes a town again, as well the administrative center of Gorodetsky Uyezd (later, Gorodetsky District). Between 1948 and 1959, the dam of Gorky Hydroelectric Station (now Nizhny Novgorod Hydroelectric Station) was built a few kilometers upstream from Gorodets, and along with the station a new industrial town, Zavolzhye, was built on the right side of the Volga. In the past, the town was also sometimes referred to as Gorodets-Radilov (), or simply Radilov. ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, Gorodets serves as the administrative centre of Gorodetsky District.Order #3-od As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Gorodetsky District as the town of district significance of Gorodets. As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Gorodets is incorporated within Gorodetsky Municipal District as Gorodets Urban Settlement.Law #114-Z ==Architecture and culture== The chief historic monuments of Gorodets‚Äîthe Trinity Cathedral (1644), St. Nicholas Church (1672), and Feodorovsky Monastery, associated with the famous icon of the same name‚Äîwere destroyed by the Communists. The oldest surviving structure is a rather plain church (1707‚Äì1712), built over the site of an earlier church where the town's best known ruler, Andrey of Gorodets, was interred in 1304. There are several museums in the town, including the Gingerbread Museum and the Samovar Museum, the latter housing a large collection of tea kettles. ==Economy== Besides sharing the Nizhny Novgorod Hydroelectric Station with Zavolzhye, Gorodets has a shipbuilding industry. Traditional local crafts‚Äîwoodworking, embroidery, honey bread baking‚Äîare still pursued in Gorodets, but in a more industrial way, at several local factories, whose products are available at souvenir shops all over the country. ===Transportation=== The electric railroad branch from Nizhny Novgorod ends in Zavolzhye; but there is a road connection over the hydro dam, which provides the only fixed crossing across the Volga between Nizhny Novgorod and Kineshma. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * * Category:Cities and towns in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast Category:Populated places on the Volga Category:1152 establishments in Europe Category:12th-century establishments in Russia ","title":"Gorodets, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast"},{"id":"1428746","text":"150px French Carmel () is a neighbourhood of Haifa (Israel), located on the western slopes of Mount Carmel.

A species with terrestrial habit and growing in clumps of several individuals, it displays showy pink to purple flowers up to wide. It is currently considered a critically endangered species by the IUCN, due to overcollection in the wild. == Description == A terrestrial orchid, Phragmipedium kovachii grows in clumps. The short stems have up to nine leaves each, which are linear- lanceolate in shape, glossy green, and up to long and up to wide. They are thick and have an acute tip; the primary vein is prominent beneath. The flower stalk is 20‚Äì52 cm (8‚Äì20.5 in) tall with a solitary flower that is 10‚Äì20 cm (4‚Äì8 in) wide. The sepals are broadly elliptic in shape and covered with golden-brown hairs externally, and whitish to rose-pink internally. The petals are pink to dark purple, broadly elliptic to obovate in shape, up to long, with recurved margins; except for the cup-shaped lip or labellum, which can be up long and wide, and is purple to fuchsia in colour. The fruits are capsules up to 10.5 cm (4.1 in) long and up to 0.9 cm (0.4 in) in diameter. 272x272px == Taxonomy == The first published description of this species was made in June 2002 by John Atwood and Stig Dalstr√∂m of Marie Selby Botanical Gardens, and Ricardo Fernandez from the San Marcos National University Herbarium (USM). An independent description prepared by orchid taxonomist Eric Christenson was published just afterwards in July 2002, using the name Phragmipedium peruvianum, which thereby became a synonym of P. kovachii. It was initially assigned to subgenus Micropetalum; however, it was later moved to its own subgenus Schluckebieria. === Controversy === Michael Kovach, an American orchid collector who bought the live type specimen of P. kovachii from a roadside vendor in Peru, had smuggled the plant into the US and taken it to the Selby Botanical Gardens. According to a report in the journal Nature, Selby Botanical Gardens knew that Eric Christenson would publish the same species in a forthcoming issue of the journal Orchids, so they rushed to publish their description in a supplement of the Selby Gardens' journal, Selbyana. Orchids in genus Phragmipedium are protected under the CITES treaty, so any trade or possession that doesn't comply with CITES standards is deemed illegal. An investigation led by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and assisted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Customs Service and the then CITES authority in Peru (INRENA) among others, brought Kovach to trial. Kovach was sentenced to 2 years probation and a fine of $1000. While Selby Botanic Gardens saw its CITES permit revoked, was sentenced to a fine of $5000, and staff member Wesley Higgins received a 6-month restriction order. A nomenclatural proposal was put forward in 2006 to declare the name Phragmipedium kovachii invalid and to add its original ad hoc publication \\"Selbyana vol. 23 Supplement\\" to the ‚Äúopera utique oppressa‚Äù (ICN Appendix VI). Counterarguments were presented in several articles. The Nomenclature Committee for Vascular Plants declined to accept the proposal, stating \\"if all names based on specimens illegally collected or named after persons who have acted unwisely ... were to be rejected, we might have some major nomenclatural instability.\\" == Distribution and habitat == Phragmipedium kovachii at The Pacific Orchid Exposition, San Francisco, CA. 2011. P. kovachii is known only from a small area of five localities in the regions of Amazonas and San Mart√≠n, Peru. It grows in primary montane forest, at 1600‚Äì1950 (‚àí2000) m of elevation, on limestone cliffs. The habitat of this species provides constant rainfall, organic matter and calcareous soil, with a pH of 6.8‚Äì7.1 (‚àí7.9). Temperature in the area has an average of 26 ¬∞C in summer and 18 ¬∞C in winter; precipitation average is in the range of 1000‚Äì1500 mm (40‚Äì60 in). == Ecology == P. kovachii grows in clumps of 15 to 20 individuals on cretaceous limestone cliffs facing south, in east-west oriented valleys. It is apparently a soil specialist since, unlike other Phragmipedium species, it prefers calcareous soils with an 85.7% of calcium carbonate content. Pollinators of this species are still unknown to science, but thought to be larger than in other Phragmipedium species, due to the bigger size of the lip. It is also hypothesized that the color pattern of the flowers mimics that of Tibouchina species, and helps attract pollinators that are sensitive to color. == Conservation == Overcollecting is a major threat to the survival of P. kovachii in the wild as it was found that one locality of P. kovachii was depleted of plants, possibly even before the scientific publication in Selbyana. Following the publication, other three localities were also overcollected. It is estimated that 5000 plants or more have been extracted from the wild. Despite its inclusion in Appendix I of CITES, there's criticism on the measure, as it is believed that it is an ineffective tool against smuggling as it slows the introduction of wild species in the legal market. The Peruvian government, in an effort to officialize the trade of P. kovachii and reduce its illegal extraction, licensed some plant nurseries for the propagation of this species. Due to the reduction of its population by overcollection and its small area of extent, Phillip Cribb (orchid expert from Kew Gardens) and the IUCN have assigned Phragmipedium kovachii the critically endangered conservation status. == Cultivation == P. kovachii will thrive in any moist growing medium with calcium content similar to the soil of its habitat, always watching for the pH levels. Fertilizers must be applied carefully especially in young plants, as fertilizers contain salts. Light requirements are medium, avoiding intense light especially when young; mature individuals can tolerate more light. Being an orchid of high elevations, temperature must be in the range of its natural habitat. == References == == Further reading == * *Damian, M. L., Williams, N. H., Whitten, W. M. (2005).

It is the state tree of Pennsylvania. == Description == A line drawing of the leaves and cones from Britton and Brown's 1913 Illustrated flora of the northern states and Canada The eastern hemlock grows well in shade and is very long lived, with the oldest recorded specimen, found in Tionesta, Pennsylvania, being at least 554 years old. The tree generally reaches heights of about , but exceptional trees have been recorded up to . The diameter of the trunk at breast height is often , but again, outstanding trees have been recorded up to . The trunk is usually straight and monopodial, but very rarely is forked. The crown is broadly conic, while the brownish bark is scaly and deeply fissured, especially with age. The twigs are a yellow-brown in color with darker red- brown pulvini, and are densely pubescent. The buds are ovoid in shape and are very small, measuring only in length. These are usually not resinous, but may be slightly so. The leaves are typically in length, but may be as short as or as long as . They are flattened and are typically distichous, or two-ranked. The bottom of the leaf is glaucous with two broad and clearly visible stomatal bands, while the top is a shiny green to yellow-green in color. The leaf margins are very slightly toothed, especially near the apex. The seed cones are ovoid in shape and typically measure in length and in width. The scales are ovate to cuneate in shape and measure in length by in width. The apex is more or less rounded and is often projected outward. Twenty-four diploid chromosomes are present within the trees' DNA. == Wood == The wood is soft, coarse-grained, and light buff in color. Air-dried, a cubic foot weighs 28 lbs. The lumber is used for general construction and crates. Because of its unusual power of holding spikes, it is also used for railroad ties. Untreated, the wood is not durable if exposed to the elements. As a fuel, it is low in value. The wood is also a source of pulp for paper manufacturing.Collingwood, C.H. and Warren D.

It ranges from northeastern Minnesota eastward through southern Quebec and into Nova Scotia, and south in the Appalachian Mountains to northern Georgia and Alabama. Disjunct populations occur in the southeastern Piedmont, western Ohio and into Illinois, as well as eastern Minnesota.Farjon, A. (1990). Pinaceae. Drawings and Descriptions of the Genera. Koeltz Scientific Books . In Canada, it is present in Ontario and all provinces to the east except Newfoundland and Labrador. Its range completely overlaps that of the closely related Tsuga caroliniana. It is found primarily on rocky ridges, ravines, and hillsides with relatively high levels of moisture. === Climate === Eastern hemlock is generally confined to areas with highland climates, with cool and humid conditions. Precipitation in the areas where it grows is typically to more than per year. The lower number is more typical of northern forests that receive heavy snowfall; the higher number is common in southerly areas with high summer rainfall. Near the Atlantic coast and in the southern Appalachians where the trees often reach their greatest heights, annual rainfall often exceeds . In the north of its range, the temperatures in January average , while in July they average only . In these areas, the frost-free season can last fewer than 80 days. In contrast, the southern end of the range experiences up to 200 days without frost and January temperatures as high as . Hemlock boughs in the autumn, shedding older foliage == Hemlock woolly adelgid == Shoot infested with hemlock woolly adelgid The species is currently threatened by the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), a sap-sucking bug introduced from East Asia to the United States in 1924, and first found in the native range of eastern hemlock in the late 1960s. The adelgid has spread very rapidly in southern parts of the range once becoming established, while its expansion northward is much slower. Virtually all the hemlocks in the southern Appalachian Mountains have seen infestations of the insect within the last five to seven years, with thousands of hectares of stands dying within the last two to three years. Attempts to save representative examples on both public and private lands are on-going. A project named \\"Tsuga Search\\", funded by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, is being conducted to save the largest and tallest remaining eastern hemlocks in the Park. Through Tsuga Search, hemlocks have been found with trunk volumes up to 44.8 m¬≥ within the park, making it the largest eastern evergreen conifer, eclipsing in volume both eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). The tree is currently listed as a near threatened species in the IUCN Red List, but this is based largely on its wide distribution and because the adelgid populations have not reached the northern areas of its range. A 2009 study conducted by scientists with the U.S. Forest Service Southern Research Station suggests the hemlock woolly adelgid is killing hemlock trees faster than expected in the southern Appalachians, and rapidly altering the carbon cycle of these forests. According to Science Daily, the pest could kill most of the region's hemlock trees within the next decade. According to the study, researchers found \\"hemlock woolly adelgid infestation is rapidly impacting the carbon cycle in [hemlock] tree stands,\\" and \\"adelgid-infested hemlock trees in the South are declining much faster than the reported 9-year decline of some infested hemlock trees in the Northeast.\\"Hemlock Trees Dying Rapidly, Affecting Forest Carbon Cycle Closeup of bark In a 2009 case study, entomologists from the U.S. Forest Service, Cornell University, and the University of Massachusetts-Amherst released 900 Laricobius nigrinus beetles into a stand of adelgid-infested hemlocks near Lansing, New York. L. nigrinus, which is native to the Pacific Northwest, naturally preys on the hemlock wooly adelgid. The particular site near Lansing was chosen because its hemlocks are only lightly infested with the woolly adelgid, and enough trees are found to sustain a long-term study. The site will be left untreated with pesticides for 10 years to study how well the L. nigrinus beetles become established; if the experiment proves successful, researchers expect the population will take two to three years to build to levels where they can be readily detected.Predator Beetle to Battle Hemlock Pest ==Ecology== The tree can be found living in association with many forest mushrooms, such as Ramaria flavosaponaria. == Paleoecology == The mid-Holocene decline of hemlock populations is a much- studied phenomenon. From its foundation in the early Holocene (around 16,000 BP) in what is now the southeastern US, T. canadensis expanded rapidly and successfully into its potential range. However, palynological analyses show the hemlock population experienced a pronounced decline approximately 5,500 BP that lasted for about 1,000 years. Continued research points to other, though less dramatic, dips in Holocene hemlock populations. Pathogens, insects, and climatic change, and a combination of these, have all been proposed to explain these anomalies. The eastern hemlock increased again after the major decline, but did not recover its former place as a dominant species. == Exceptional trees == Due to its being a long-lived tree, several very large or otherwise impressive trees exist along the east coast of North America. One organization, the Eastern Native Tree Society (ENTS), has been particularly active in discovering and measuring these trees. In the southern Appalachians, many individuals reach tall, and one tree has been measured in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to tall, though this tree is now dead from hemlock woolly adelgids; the tallest now surviving, the \\"Noland Mountain tree\\", is tall. Altogether, ENTS has confirmed four trees to heights of or more by climb and tape drop. In the Northeast, the tallest accurately measured tree is . This tree, named the Seneca hemlock, grows in Cook Forest State Park, PA. Above 43¬∞N latitude, the maximum height of the species is less, under . In New England, ENTS has measured hemlocks to , although trees above 39 m are extremely rare in New England. By 44¬∞N, the maximum height is probably not more than . Diameters of mature hemlocks range from , with trees over in diameter being very rare. In New England, the maximum diameter is . Trunk volume is the third dimension to receive attention by ENTS. Many eastern hemlocks have been modeled to over 30 m¬≥ trunk volume, and the largest has been calculated to be 44.8 m¬≥, making it the largest natural evergreen conifer in the eastern United States. The center of maximum size development for the species is the southern Appalachians, especially the Great Smoky Mountains. == Cultivation == Tsuga canadensis has long been a popular tree in cultivation. The tree's preference for partial shade and tolerance of full shade allows it to be planted in areas where other conifers would not easily grow. In addition, its very fine-textured foliage that droops to the ground, its pyramidal growth habit, and its ability to withstand hard pruning make it a desirable ornamental tree. In cultivation, it prefers sites that are slightly acidic to neutral with nutrient-rich and moist but well-drained soil. It is most often used as a specimen, for a screen, or in small group plantings, though it can also be trained as a dense formal hedge. It should not be used on roadsides where salt is used in winter, as its foliage is sensitive to salt spray. It is also poorly adapted as a windbreak tree, as wind exposure causes dieback in winter. It has several drawbacks, such as a fairly low tolerance of urban stress, intolerance for very wet or very dry soils, and susceptibility to attack by the hemlock woolly adelgid, though this is treatable. Its tendency to shed needles rapidly after being cut down renders it unsuitable as a Christmas tree. It was introduced to British gardens in 1736.Mitchell, A. F. (1974). A Field Guide to the Trees of Britain and Northern Europe. Collins In the UK, it is encountered frequently in gardens both large and small, as well as some parks, and is most common in the eastern areas of the country. It is sometimes employed as a hedge, but is considered inferior for this usage compared to Tsuga heterophylla (western hemlock); it is not well adapted to the UK climate and as a consequence often has a poorly developed, forked and sinuous trunk there.Mitchell, A. F. (1972). Conifers in the British Isles. Forestry Commission Booklet 33. In Germany, it is the most frequently seen hemlock in cultivation, and is also used in forestry.

Population: 23,000 (1974). ==History== It was founded by Yury Dolgoruky in 1152. First part of its name derives from Yury's patron saint, St. George. The second part is derived from the word polsky meaning \\"in the fields\\". This specification was needed in order to distinguish the town from the earlier established fortress of Yuryev (nowadays Tartu), at the time located in the woods in what is now Estonia and then the biggest Russian settlement in the territory of the Chuds. Upon Vsevolod III's death in 1212, the town was assigned to one of his youngest sons, Svyatoslav. It was that prince who personally designed the town's chief landmark, the Cathedral of St. George (1230‚Äì1234). It is the latest pre-Mongol construction in Russia, unprecedented in abundance of stone sculptures, and also the model for first stone churches in the Moscow Kremlin. In the 1460s, the cathedral's dome collapsed, thus burying most of unique sculptures which had adorned the cathedral walls. The collapsed roof was sloppily restored by a well-known Muscovite artisan, Vasili Yermolin, in 1471. St. George's Cathedral (1230-1234) was the last stone church built in Russia before the Mongol invasion The great Battle of Lipitsa was fought near the town in 1216. In 1238, Yuryev was sacked by the Mongols. A century later, it was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The chief monument of the Muscovite period is the walled Monastery of Archangel Michael, founded in the 13th century and containing various buildings from the 17th and 18th centuries. Several miles from Yuryev, on the bank of the Yakhroma River, stands the Kosmin Cloister, whose structures are typical for the mid-17th century. ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, Yuryev- Polsky serves as the administrative center of Yuryev-Polsky District, to which it is directly subordinated.Resolution #433 As a municipal division, the town of Yuryev-Polsky is incorporated within Yuryev-Polsky Municipal District as Yuryev-Polsky Urban Settlement.Law #55-OZ ==Twin towns ‚Äì sister cities== Yuryev-Polsky is twinned with: * H√Ænce»ôti, Moldova ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * * ==External links== * Unofficial website of Yuryev-Polsky *Picture of Kosmin Cloister Category:Cities and towns in Vladimir Oblast Category:Yuryevsky Uyezd (Vladimir Governorate) Category:Golden Ring of Russia Category:1152 establishments in Europe Category:12th-century establishments in Russia ","title":"Yuryev-Polsky (town)"},{"id":"1428793","text":"Contemporary hit radio (also known as CHR, contemporary hits, hit list, current hits, hit music, top 40, or pop radio) is a radio format that is common in the United States, Brazil, United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Trinidad and Tobago, and South Africa, that focuses on playing current and recurrent popular music as determined by the top 40 music charts. There are several subcategories, dominantly focusing on rock, pop, or urban music. Used alone, CHR most often refers to the CHR-pop format. The term contemporary hit radio was coined in the early 1980s by Radio & Records magazine to designate top 40 stations which continued to play hits from all musical genres as pop music splintered into adult contemporary, urban contemporary and other formats. The term \\"top 40\\" is also used to refer to the actual list of hit songs, and, by extension, to refer to pop music in general. The term has also been modified to describe top 50; top 30; top 20; top 10; hot 100 (each with its number of songs) and hot hits radio formats, but carrying more or less the same meaning and having the same creative point of origin with Todd Storz as further refined by Gordon McLendon as well as Bill Drake. The format became especially popular in the mid-sixties as radio stations constrained disc jockeys to numbered play lists in the wake of the payola scandal. ==Variations== ===Mainstream CHR=== Also known as CHR/pop or teen CHR. Plays pop, and dance, and sometimes urban, alternative, rock, and country crossover as well. Often referred as \\"top 40\\"; in terms of incorporating a variety of genres of music, CHR/pop is the successor to the original concept of top 40 radio which originated in the 1950s. Examples of CHR/pop stations in the United States, Brazil and the Philippines include WHTZ in New York City, KIIS-FM and KAMP-FM in Los Angeles, Jovem Pan And Jovem Pan FM in Brazil, KLUC in Las Vegas, KRBE in Houston, KXXM and KTFM in San Antonio, WIOQ in Philadelphia, WXKS-FM in Boston, WKSC-FM and WBBM-FM in Chicago, WFLZ in Tampa/St. Petersburg, WHYI in Miami, WNCI in Columbus, Ohio, WZPL in Indianapolis, KDWB in Minneapolis/St. Paul, and DWFO, DWTM and DWRT-FM in Manila, Philippines. ===Adult CHR=== These stations typically are hybrids of the contemporary hit radio (CHR/pop) and hot AC formats. This format contains a strong focus on current chart, contemporary and recurrent hits as well as placing a minority of older, classic hits from the 2000s and early to mid 2010s onto the playlist. Adult CHR stations play pop-friendly rhythmic, dance and hip hop titles from artists such as Rihanna, Post Malone, Khalid, Lizzo, Black Eyed Peas, The Weeknd, Doja Cat and Blackbear All Access Hot AC chart, https://www.allaccess.com/mediabase/q/report/sevenDay/format/A2/panel/R/detail/C/reportType/R alongside standard mainstream pop and pop rock fare. Examples in the U.S. include WKRQ in Cincinnati, WWMX in Baltimore, WTIC-FM in Hartford, WMXZ in Charleston, and KZZO in Sacramento. United Kingdom (UK) media regulator Ofcom states: \\"where a format requires a contemporary and chart music service, the main diet must be of modern music, reflecting the charts of today and recent months. Older, classic tracks would not be out of place, but only as spice to the main offering.\\"Ofcom About radio formats The adult CHR format is sometimes utilized by stations which are heritage Top 40/CHR outlets in their respective markets which have been in the format since the 1970s or 1980s or FM successors to former AM top 40s. See also: Adult Top 40, a US Billboard chart. ===Rhythmic CHR=== Also known as CHR/rhythmic, or CHR/urban. These stations focus on hip-hop and dance-pop. There are differences between CHR/rhythmic and the urban contemporary format; urban stations will often play R&B; and soul songs that CHR/rhythmic stations will not, and CHR/rhythmic stations, despite playlists heavy with urban product, sometimes have white disc jockeys and will include EDM and rhythmic pop music that urban outlets will not play. KYLD in San Francisco, WQHT in New York, and KPWR in Los Angeles are among the most successful CHR/rhythmic stations in the U.S. and among the pioneers of the format. === Bilingual CHR === Bilingual Spanish CHRs (such as WPOW in Miami, KHHM in Sacramento, California, KKPS and KBFM in Brownsville, Texas, WKAQ and WXYX in San Juan, Puerto Rico, KBHH in Fresno, California WRUM-HD2 in Orlando, Florida and KLLI-(FM) in Los Angeles combine current and recent mainstream and rhythmic CHR hits with recent Latin pop hits, targeting young Latina listeners. Similarly, bilingual French CHRs (such as CKOI-FM in Montreal) are common in many Canadian markets, and combine anglophone and French pop hits. ===CHR/dance=== Playing dance remixes of popular songs with perhaps some current hits from the dance charts. Pure dance-music radio stations (as opposed to CHR/rhythmic and rhythmic AC formats such as MOViN) are not very common but tend to have loyal audiences in the markets where they do exist. Examples include KDHT-FM in Denver, WPTY on Long Island, NY and KNHC in Seattle. See also: Dance/Mix Show Airplay ===CHR/rock=== Stations with this format are similar in some ways to the adult CHR and mainstream CHR/pop formats, but also incorporate modern rock and modern AC titles in an upbeat presentation. Examples include KSXY in Santa Rosa, California and KKCK in Marshall, Minnesota. An early version of rock- leaning CHR is Rock 40, which was popular in the late 1980s. This format, developed by Joint Communications who servicemarked the name in 1987, is a young-male-targeted hybrid of CHR and album-oriented rock (AOR) that combines the formatics of the former with the music mix of the latter. After a short period of successful ratings, the Rock 40 format began to decline because it was too similar to conventional AOR yet lacked appeal among CHR fans who desired less emphasis on rock. According to Lee Abrams, a pioneer of the AOR format, Rock 40 was \\"too wimpy for the real rockers and too hard for the mainstream people\\". Stations that previously broadcast the format include KEGL in Dallas, KQLZ (Pirate Radio) in Los Angeles, KRZR in Fresno, California, KXXR in Kansas City, and WMMS in Cleveland. Rock 40 stations eventually segued to CHR or an AOR spinoff format such as active rock or modern rock. ===Other variations=== There are also ethnic variations, such as CHR/espa√±ol (Latin pop), and CHR/Tejano (Tex-Mex and Tejano) which are commonly found in Arizona, Texas, California, and Mexico. In Greater China (People's Republic of China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong), there is also Mandopop and Cantopop which are the top 40 variants in that language. ==Key contributors== ===Todd Storz=== Credit for the format is widely given to Todd Storz, who was the director of radio station KOWH-AM in Omaha, Nebraska in 1951. At that time typical AM radio programming consisted largely of full-service \\"block programming\\": pre- scheduled, sponsored programs of a wide variety, including radio dramas and variety shows. Local popular music hits, if they made it on the air at all, had to be worked in between these segments. Storz noted the great response certain songs got from the record-buying public and compared it to the way certain selections on jukeboxes were played over and over. He expanded his domain of radio stations, purchasing WTIX-AM in New Orleans, Louisiana, gradually converted his stations to an all-hits format, and pioneered the practice of surveying record stores to determine which singles were popular each week. Storz found that the more people heard a given song on the radio or from the jukebox, the more likely they were to buy a copy; a conclusion not obvious in the industry at the time. In 1952 he purchased what was then WLAF- AM in Lafayette, Indiana and constructed WAZY-AM/FM which is still the longest running top 40 FM station in existence to this day. In 1954, Storz purchased WHB-AM, a high-powered station in Kansas City, Missouri which could be heard throughout the Midwest and Great Plains, converted it to an all-hits format, and dubbed the result \\"top 40\\". Shortly thereafter WHB debuted the first \\"top 40 countdown\\", a reverse-order playing of the station's ranking of hit singles for that week. Within a few years, top 40 stations appeared all over the country to great success, spurred by the burgeoning popularity of rock and roll music, especially that of Elvis Presley. A 1950s employee at WHB, Ruth Meyer, went on to have tremendous success in the early to mid-60's as program director of New York's premiere top 40 station at that time, WMCA. Storz Broadcasting Company consisted of six AM radio stations, all featuring top 40 in the sixties. ===Gordon McLendon=== Although Todd Storz is regarded as the father of the top 100 format, Gordon McLendon of Dallas, Texas, is regarded as the person who took an idea and turned it into a mass media marketing success in combination with the development in that same city of PAMS jingles. McLendon's successful Mighty 1190 KLIF in Dallas, along with his two other Texas Triangle stations, 610 KILT (AM) Houston and 550 KTSA San Antonio, which went top 40 during the mid to late 1950s, soon became perhaps the most imitated radio stations in America. With careful attention to programming, McLendon presented his stations as packages to advertisers and listeners alike. It was the combination of top 40 and PAMS jingles which became the key to the success of the radio format itself. Not only were the same records played on different stations across America, but so were the same jingle music beds whose lyrics were resung repetitively for each station to create individual station identity. To this basic mix were added contests, games and disc jockey patter. Various groups (including Bartell Broadcasters) emphasized local variations on their top 40 stations. Gordon McLendon would operate approximately a dozen and a half AM, FM and TV stations at various times, experimenting with formats other than top 40 (including beautiful music and all-news). ===Rick Sklar=== In the early 1960s Rick Sklar also developed the top 40 format for radio station WABC in New York City which was then copied by stations in the eastern and mid-western United States such as WKBW and WLS. ===Bill Drake=== Bill Drake built upon the foundation established by Storz and McLendon to create a variation called \\"Boss Radio\\". This format began in California in early 1961 at KSTN in Stockton, then expanded in 1962‚Äì63 to KYNO in Fresno, in 1964 to KGB in San Diego, and finally to KHJ in Los Angeles in May 1965; it was further adapted to stations across the western US. Boss Radio was later broadcast by American disc jockeys as a hybrid format on pirate radio station Swinging Radio England, broadcasting from onboard a ship anchored off the coast of southern England in international waters. At that time there were no commercial radio stations in the UK, and BBC radio offered only sporadic top 40 programming. Other noteworthy North American top 40 stations that used the Drake approach included KFRC in San Francisco; CKLW in Windsor, Ontario; WRKO in Boston; WHBQ in Memphis; WOLF in Syracuse, New York; and WOR-FM in New York City. Most listeners identified Boss Radio with less talk, shorter jingles and more music. ===Mike Joseph and hot hits=== Mike Joseph's \\"hot hits\\" stations of the late 1970s and early 1980s attempted to revitalize the format by refocusing listeners' attention on current, active \\"box-office\\" music. Thus, hot hits stations played only current hit songs‚Äîno oldies unless they were on current chart albums‚Äîin a fast, furious and repetitive fashion, with fast-talking personalities and loud, pounding jingles. In 1977, WTIC-FM in Hartford, CT, dropped its long-running classical format for Joseph's format as \\"96 Tics\\" and immediately became one of the top radio stations in the market. The first Joseph station to use the term \\"hot hits\\" on the air was WFBL (\\"Fire 14\\", which played its top 14 hits in very tight rotation) in Syracuse, NY, in 1979. Then WCAU-FM in Philadelphia switched to hot hits as \\"98 Now\\" in the fall of 1981 and was instantly successful. Other major-market stations which adopted the hot hits format in the early 1980s included WBBM-FM Chicago, WHYT (now WDVD) Detroit, WMAR-FM (now WWMX) Baltimore, which we might add was not successful against market leader WBSB B104, KITS San Francisco, and WNVZ Norfolk. ===Don Pierson=== Don Pierson took the formats of Gordon McLendon, boss radio and PAMS jingles to the UK in the form of Wonderful Radio London, (a pirate radio ship) and subsequently revolutionized the popular music format. On 14 August 1967 The Marine Offences Act was introduced in the UK and the pirate stations were shut down. The British Broadcasting Corporation were chosen by the UK government to come up with a station to replace the pirates, and so in 1967 BBC Radio 1 started broadcasting, employing many of the DJ's from the pirate stations (Tony Blackburn, Kenny Everett and John Peel etc.) and obtaining re-sings of the PAMS jingles. In fact it was Tony Blackburn who played the first pop record on Radio 1, The Move's \\"Flowers In The Rain\\". ==Countdowns, shows and personalities== *List of number-one hits (United States) *Rick Dees Weekly Top 40 *Ryan Seacrest *Sean ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù Hamilton *The Official Big Top 40, Global Radio's nationally syndicated chart show in the United Kingdom.

The group is composed of Troy Sanders (bass/vocals), Brent Hinds (lead guitar/vocals), Bill Kelliher (rhythm guitar/backing vocals), and Brann Dailor (drums/vocals). Mastodon has released seven studio albums, as well as a number of other releases. The band's 2002 debut album, Remission, garnered significant critical acclaim for its unique sound. Mastodon's second full- length release, Leviathan, is a concept album based on the novel Moby-Dick by Herman Melville. Three magazines awarded the record Album of the Year in 2004: Revolver, Kerrang! and Terrorizer. The song \\"Colony of Birchmen\\" from the band's third album (released in 2006), Blood Mountain, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2007. Blood Mountain was followed in 2009 by Crack the Skye, and in 2011 by The Hunter, which debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 chart and achieved major commercial success in the United States. The Hunter features the song \\"Curl of the Burl\\", which was nominated for a Grammy for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance in 2012. Mastodon's 2014 album, Once More 'Round the Sun, peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 chart and features the band's third Grammy-nominated song, \\"High Road\\". The band's seventh album, Emperor of Sand, was released on March 31, 2017, and features the band's most commercially successful song to date, \\"Show Yourself\\", which peaked at No. 4 on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart in June 2017. The followup single, \\"Steambreather\\", peaked at number 18 on the same chart in October 2017. The album's opening track, \\"Sultan's Curse\\", earned the band their first Grammy award. Emperor of Sand was the band's first album to receive a Grammy nomination; it was nominated for Best Rock Album. ==History== ===Formation, early years and Remission (2000‚Äì2003)=== Mastodon was formed on January 13, 2000, after drummer Brann Dailor and guitarist Bill Kelliher moved to Atlanta from Victor, New York, and met bassist/singer Troy Sanders and guitarist/singer Brent Hinds at a High on Fire show. They discovered they had a mutual appreciation of sludge metal bands Melvins and Neurosis, heavy metal legends Iron Maiden, and 1970s hard rockers Thin Lizzy, and shortly thereafter formed Mastodon. In an interview in 2009, Kelliher revealed that the first time Hinds attended a practice with the band, he \\"showed up so wasted he couldn't play\\". The band recorded a demo in 2000, which featured Eric Saner on vocals. Saner left the band for personal reasons after just a couple of months. After recording a four-song demo and a 7-inch picture disc through Reptilian Records, Mastodon landed a record deal with Relapse Records in 2001. Mastodon released the EP Lifesblood in 2001, and its first full-length album, Remission, in 2002, with the singles \\"March of the Fire Ants\\" and \\"Crusher/Destroyer\\" (which was also featured on Tony Hawk's Underground). On each of Mastodon's first three full-length albums, the last track was an instrumental composition with a title that related to the Elephant Man. ===Leviathan and Call of the Mastodon (2004‚Äì2005)=== Brent Hinds, Troy Sanders and Brann Dailor in 2004 The band's second full-length album, Leviathan, was released in 2004. It is a concept album loosely based on Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick. The band received critical acclaim for Leviathan and the record was named album of the year by Kerrang! and Terrorizer. \\"Blood and Thunder\\", which featured Clutch vocalist Neil Fallon, was chosen as one of the most important recordings of the decade by National Public Radio in November 2009, and that the entire album epitomizes \\" a phenomenal decade for metal\\". Leviathan also ranked second in a list by Metal Hammer of the best albums of 2004. The band went on tour in support of the album, playing throughout North America and Europe in The Unholy Alliance tour along with Slayer and Lamb of God and later on with Slipknot. \\"Iron Tusk\\", the fifth track on the album, can be found on the soundtrack of the skateboarding video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and in 2K Sports video game NHL 2K9. \\"Blood and Thunder\\" is featured in the video games Need for Speed: Most Wanted, Project Gotham Racing 3, and Saints Row. \\"Blood and Thunder\\" was added as a playable track on all instruments in Guitar Hero: Metallica and was featured in Japanese music games Drummania V2 and Guitarfreaks V2. Specific HTML frames at and It has also been released as downloadable content for Rock Band 3, with Pro Guitar support also available at extra cost. Leviathan was followed by the 2006 release of Call of the Mastodon, a remastered collection of the band's first nine songs, and a DVD of interviews and concert footage called The Workhorse Chronicles that includes material from the band's early days as a five-piece. The band has stated that they consider \\"Call of the Mastodon\\" to be their first studio album even though it was the third to be released. These two releases were the band's last for Relapse Records, as they would later go on to sign with Warner Bros. Mastodon also recorded a cover version of Metallica's \\"Orion\\" for a 2006 Kerrang! tribute album marking the twentieth anniversary of the release of Master of Puppets. ===Blood Mountain (2006‚Äì2008)=== Their third studio album, Blood Mountain, was released on September 12, 2006, followed by a tour to support the album along with Tool in Europe and Slayer in Australia and New Zealand. The Mars Volta frontman Cedric Bixler-Zavala lent his vocals to the track \\"Siberian Divide\\". Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme contributed vocals for the song \\"Colony of Birchmen\\". Mastodon live at Roskilde Festival 2007 The band performed the song \\"Colony of Birchmen\\" on NBC's Late Night with Conan O'Brien on November 1, their first appearance on network television, to a viewing audience of around 2.4 million people. This song was also featured in the video games Saints Row 2 and Rock Band 2. The band's first single off Blood Mountain, \\"Capillarian Crest\\", was ranked number 27 in Rolling Stone Magazine's Top 100 Songs of 2006. The album itself was ranked 9th in the magazine's best albums of the year chart. The UK's Metal Hammer voted it the best album of 2006 in its end of year critic's poll. The album was voted in at No. 5 by Kerrang! in their end of year list, No. 6 on PopMatters' Best Albums of 2006, and No. 1 on The Best Metal Albums of 2006. About.com rated it the top metal album of 2006. Blood Mountain was also named best album of 2006 in the 10th anniversary birthday edition (issue 119) of Bizarre. It also came in at No. 2 on Revolver magazine's list of the top albums of 2006. The band was named Artist Of The Month for March 2007 at Gametap.com. The band had been touring and playing numerous shows during this time. Mastodon joined Against Me!, and Cursive for a North American tour, with Planes Mistaken for Stars opening for one leg and These Arms Are Snakes the other. A performance in Milwaukee had to be canceled due to illness on the part of Brent Hinds. Mastodon would play the Hove Festival in Norway as well as on the Main Stage of the Download Festival and then the Pitchfork Music Festival. During this time the band opened for Metallica on the Sick of the Studio tour. The band also played at the 2007 Dubai Desert Rock, the 2008 Bonnaroo Music festivals, and the inaugural Mayhem Festival. Mastodon then toured with Slayer, Trivium, Lamb of God and several other metal bands in 2008 for The Unholy Alliance tour 2008. The band performed \\"Colony of Birchmen\\" at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards live with Josh Homme. After the televised performance, Brent Hinds was reported to have sustained a severe head injury. Blabbermouth.net initially reported that it was the result of a brutal assault, but the police report later suggested that an inebriated Hinds had started a fight with System of a Down bassist Shavo Odadjian and vocalist William Hudson, also known as Reverend William Burke of Achozen. \\"Sleeping Giant\\" was made available as a downloadable song for Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, \\"Colony of Birchmen\\" was included on Harmonix's Rock Band 2 and also volition's Saints row 2, and \\"Divinations\\" was featured in Madden NFL 10 and Saints Row: The Third. Mastodon contributed a cover version of Harry Nilsson's \\"One\\" to the video game Army of Twos advertisement campaign. The band members are fans of Aqua Teen Hunger Force and in 2007, Mastodon performed the opening song of Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters, \\"Cut You Up with a Linoleum Knife\\". ===Crack the Skye and Live at the Aragon (2009‚Äì2010)=== Brent Hinds performing in 2009. Crack the Skye was released on March 24, 2009, as a normal version and a deluxe version (which includes all songs in instrumental versions as well as their normal versions) and entered the Billboard 200 at number 11 a week later. The album is produced by Brendan O'Brien and Scott Kelly of Neurosis returns as a guest musician on the title- track. In a MusicRadar interview, guitarist Bill Kelliher confirmed the album is about an \\"out-of-body experience\\", and looks at the concepts of astral travel, wormholes, Stephen Hawking's theories and the spiritual realm. The album follows a quadriplegic who learns astral projection. On his journey he flies too close to the sun, burning his umbilical cord which connects him to his body, and flies into oblivion. At the same time in Czarist Russia, Rasputin and his cult were channeling spirits and brought the quadriplegic to their time. He explains his situation and foretells the assassination of Rasputin. Inevitably Rasputin is assassinated and Rasputin guides him back to his body. The band had debuted three new tracks at the Bonnaroo Music Festival, but did not play any more live shows before the album's release, due to fears of internet distribution and wanting to play the songs to the right audience. Drummer Brann Dailor sings lead vocals for the verses of the song \\"Oblivion\\". Mastodon was a headliner at the Scion Rock Fest on February 28, 2009, performing a set containing three tracks from Crack the Skye, the first time these songs were played since being finalized and recorded. On May 15, 2009, Mastodon performed a shortened version of \\"Oblivion\\" on the Late Show with David Letterman. Bill Kelliher live at Sonisphere Festival in 2009 In order to support their new album, Mastodon toured with Metallica on the latter part of the 2009 European leg of their World Magnetic Tour. In Fall of 2009, they embarked with Dethklok on the \\"Adult Swim Presents\\" tour along with Converge and High on Fire. On October 17, 2009, they recorded a DVD documenting the tour at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago. Mastodon played the alternative music festival Big Day Out, touring across Australia and New Zealand in January and February 2010. On October 29, 2009, they performed \\"Divinations\\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. On November 4, 2009, Mastodon released their second EP, entitled Oblivion. Teaming up with bands Deftones and Alice in Chains, Mastodon went on tour in September 2010 in the United States and Canada. The tour was called Blackdiamondskye, a portmanteau of the three bands' latest albums (Black Gives Way to Blue, Diamond Eyes, and Crack the Skye). Film director Jimmy Hayward contacted the band during their 2009 tour of Europe and expressed how much listening to Blood Mountain had helped his creative process while finishing a screenplay, and he offered Mastodon a chance to score the film he had been working on - Jonah Hex. In an interview with Paste magazine, bassist Troy Sanders said that Hayward \\"called us out of the blue as a fan. It was the most beautiful, authentic way to collaborate.\\" Mastodon used scenes from the film as inspiration during the writing and recording process, and the instrumental soundtrack, Jonah Hex: Revenge Gets Ugly EP, was released on June 29, 2010, through Reprise Records. In 2010, the band was confirmed as being part of the soundtrack for Namco Bandai Games' 2010 remake of Splatterhouse. The game's protagonist can also be seen wearing a Mastodon T-shirt in certain flashback cutscenes. On March 15, 2011, Mastodon released their first live DVD/CD entitled Live at the Aragon through Reprise. The recording features the entire performance of their fourth studio album, Crack the Skye, along with songs from their previous records. ===The Hunter (2011‚Äì2012)=== Troy Sanders with Mastodon at Sonisphere, Stockholm in 2011 The Hunter, Mastodon's fifth studio album, was recorded at Doppler Studios in Atlanta with producer Mike Elizondo. The first hints of the new album were given by the band via Facebook in January 2011. Drummer Brann Dailor revealed during interviews the title of the band's new album and described the new material as not so much proggy as riff-oriented and \\"a little more stripped down\\". Meanwhile, the band performed in many major summer festivals. On June 28, 2011, Mastodon released through Adultswim.com a leftover track from the Crack the Skye sessions called \\"Deathbound\\". The first taste of The Hunter came in July 2011 where Mastodon released via YouTube the song \\"Black Tongue\\", set to a video of AJ Fosik creating the sculpture used for the album cover. By August 12, the band had revealed the track listing from The Hunter and debuted \\"Curl Of The Burl\\", the first official single from the new album. Mike Elizondo was chosen to produce the album which marks his first time working with the band. It was also announced that a deluxe edition would be released. It featured the two bonus tracks \\"The Ruiner\\" and \\"Deathbound\\" and a different cover. On September 6, Mastodon released a third song from The Hunter, \\"Spectrelight\\", featuring Scott Kelly of Neurosis. On September 16, the band released a 53-minute custom visualizer with all of the album tracks, 11 days prior to the release of The Hunter. In support of the album a North American headline tour was announced. The album was very well received by fans and the media. It also performed strongly on the official charts, rising to number ten on the Billboard 200. On October 5, 2011, they performed \\"Curl of the Burl\\" on the Late Show with David Letterman. On October 12, a UK tour was announced that will run through February 2012 with fellow bands The Dillinger Escape Plan and Red Fang as support acts. They were at Later... with Jools Holland, where they performed \\"Black Tongue\\" and \\"Curl of the Burl\\". A seventeen-date European tour was announced that featured dates in Scandinavia, Germany, France, Spain, Belgium, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands and Latvia. On December 1, \\"Curl of the Burl\\" was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category Best Metal/Hard Rock performance. It is the band's second nomination with the first being for \\"Colony of Birchmen\\" in 2007. The record was named \\"Album of the Year\\" by Metal Hammer, Classic Rock and Rock Sound. In January 2012 it was announced that Mastodon and Swedish prog metal band Opeth will tour together in a joint tour across North America. It was named the \\"Heritage Hunter Tour\\" after both bands latest releases, The Hunter and Heritage. The bands took turns in the headlining spot. Support came from the Swedish heavy metal band Ghost. On February 11, 2012, the band performed a sold-out show at the Brixton Academy in London, it was the band's biggest headline show ever. Dry Bone Valley\\" was released on February 13 as the third single of the album. A music video for the song was also released.

Mastodon covered Feist's \\"A Commotion\\" and Feist covered Mastodon's \\"Black Tongue\\". The pair also released a one of a kind interactive, crossfading music video for the song 'A Commotion'. The second release was a cover of The Flaming Lips' \\"A Spoonful Weighs a Ton\\". The band spent the summer performing at festivals across Europe and South America. It was the last tour in support of The Hunter. ===Once More 'Round the Sun (2014‚Äì2015)=== Mastodon began recording again in early 2013. Guitarist Brent Hinds described the new music as \\"really eerie\\" and \\"very spooky-sounding\\", and stated that he has written three new songs. On December 3, 2012, the band announced via their Twitter page that they were writing a song for the film Monsters University. However, the song used in the film was the previously released \\"Island\\". They were also part of the 2013 Rockstar Energy Mayhem Festival. On May 6, 2013, the band stated that they are \\"...Very busy writing and putting songs together for the next studio Mastodon album...\\" In an interview on July 26, Brann Dailor was reported as saying that the band would \\"probably [go into the studio] end of September\\". The band also played at the 2014 Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival. Brent Hinds (left) and Troy Sanders (right) in May 2014 On February 27, Brann Dailor told in the interview that their sixth album would be released in summer of 2014, and he also stated that the band would release an EP in winter of 2014. Some of the confirmed tracks were: \\"Tread Lightly\\", \\"Buzzard's Guts\\", \\"Scent of Bitter Almonds\\", \\"High Road\\" and \\"Aunt Lisa\\". In an interview with Troy Sanders in Paste magazine released on April 3, he revealed the album was called Once More 'Round the Sun and had 15 tracks. He also confirmed that Mastodon recorded 90 minutes of material, but only 60 minutes of it will be present on the album; the unreleased material possibly might be released on an EP later in 2014. A few more tracks that have been confirmed are: \\"Diamonds in the Witch House\\" (which has Scott Kelly from Neurosis on a guest vocal appearance), and \\"Ember City\\". In an interview on April 11, Dailor revealed the album will be released in June. On April 17, the first single \\"High Road\\" was made available for streaming. On 26 April, Bill Kelliher revealed the title of the second single \\"Chimes at Midnight\\". As of June 16, 2014, the entire album is streaming on iTunes. The album was released on June 24, 2014 through Reprise Records. The album sold around 34,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release to land at position No. 6 on The Billboard 200 chart making it the band's first consecutive top 10 debut, with their previous album, The Hunter, peaking at No.10 after opening with 39,000 copies in 2011. ===Emperor of Sand and Cold Dark Place (2017‚Äìpresent)=== On January 18, 2015, it was reported that Brent Hinds was working on a new Mastodon album, showing a picture with him playing the 13 string pedal steel. The same report was later confirmed by Troy Sanders, who stated: \\"Every record that we do is gonna sound different, because we always want to evolve and create our own musical path. And every record will be different. We do not wanna write the same record twice.\\" On March 12, 2015, Mastodon released a new track called \\"White Walker\\", which appears on the Game of Thrones: Catch the Throne Vol. 2 mixtape to promote the fifth season of the HBO TV series Game of Thrones. Dailor, Hinds, and Kelliher also appeared in episode 8 of the season as wildlings. This mixtape will also feature songs by various other acts, ranging from Killswitch Engage to Snoop Dogg. Hinds and Kelliher once again returned to Game of Thrones as wights among the White Walker army for the season 7 finale episode, \\"The Dragon and the Wolf\\". The band's seventh studio album, Emperor of Sand, was released on March 31, 2017. The theme for the album was cancer, inspired by Troy's wife who was diagnosed with cancer, and Bill's mother who lost her life to cancer. It details the story of a traveller banished to the desert by an emperor, in effect giving him a death sentence. The story is a metaphor for someone diagnosed with terminal cancer. The first single, \\"Show Yourself\\", was released in February, and had peaked at number 4 on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart in June, making it the band's highest charting song to date. The second single, \\"Steambreather\\", peaked at number 18 on the same chart in October. Mastodon also released an EP titled Cold Dark Place on September 22 of the same year. It was a four-song EP, featuring three songs recorded during the Once More 'Round the Sun sessions, and one track recorded during the Emperor of Sand sessions. The first single for the EP, \\"Toe to Toes\\" was released on September 1, 2017. Brent Hinds stated that the inspiration behind some of the songs recorded for Cold Dark Place, which he wrote, were inspired by a nasty breakup that he had endured. Describing the sound of the record, Hinds stated that \\"I wrote some pretty dark, beautiful, spooky, funky, ethereal, melancholy music, which also sounds like the Bee Gees a little bit.\\" On December 1, the band released a revised version of the 12-part \\"The Making of Emperor of Sand\\" documentary via their official YouTube channel. Mastodon were announced to be on a co-headlining Summer 2018 Tour with Primus spanning across North America lasting from May to July. On July 31, 2020, Mastodon released a new song titled \\"Fallen Torches\\" and announced the release of Medium Rarities, a compilation album with rare tracks, set for September 11, 2020. ==Characteristics== ===Musical style=== Brann Dailor's (pictured) fill-heavy drumming style is influenced by jazz and progressive rock, characterized by complex, atypical rhythmic structures (including irregular stopping and starting). He also attributes his style to band practice as a teenager, claiming that practicing with the guitarist instead of the bassist influenced his style. Mastodon has been described as a heavy metal band, along with more specific genres such as progressive metal, sludge metal, alternative metal, stoner rock, psychedelic metal, experimental metal, and groove metal. James Christopher Monger of AllMusic describes Mastodon as \\"one of the more notable new wave of American heavy metal acts, a genre spawned in the mid-'90s\\" and says that \\"Mastodon's innovative, lyrically astute blend of progressive metal, grindcore, and hardcore helped position the band as one of the preeminent metal acts of the early 21st century.\\" Bassist Troy Sanders stated about their musical style: Scott Kelly of Neurosis has appeared to perform guest vocals on a track on every Mastodon album excluding Remission. Mastodon's musical style has evolved much from their earliest pre-Remission releases to The Hunter. Their early work is significantly heavier and more abrasive than their later work, primarily or exclusively using harsh vocals, more distorted instruments, and more atypical song structures; this is especially prominent in their earliest work. The release of Mastodon's third studio album, Blood Mountain, which incorporates both clean and harsh vocals, marked a shift in the vocal styles used, with subsequent albums favouring clean vocals almost exclusively. ===Lyrical themes=== Over its first four albums, Mastodon had specific concepts in mind, specifically the classical elements of fire, water, earth, and aether. Remission does not deal with a particular theme but it is loosely based on the theme of fire. Songs like \\"Crusher Destroyer\\", \\"Where Strides the Behemoth\\" and \\"Ol'e Nessie\\" deal with the theme of fictional creatures. Leviathan is about the novel Moby-Dick. It centers around the main characters and their thoughts during the story. Blood Mountain is about a man who is searching for the \\"Crystal Skull\\", which is on top of the \\"Blood Mountain\\". According to bassist Troy Sanders, \\"It's about climbing up a mountain and the different things that can happen to you when you're stranded on a mountain, in the woods, and you're lost. You're starving, hallucinating, running into strange creatures. You're being hunted. It's about that whole struggle.\\" Crack the Skye deals with many different themes. The title, as well as some lyrical content, is a tribute to Skye, the younger sister of drummer Brann Dailor, who committed suicide at the age of fourteen. Themes touched on within the album include \\"dark magic(k), astral travelling and the role of Rasputin in the downfall of Czarist Russia\\". The Hunter does not deal with an entire concept like their earlier work. The title is a tribute to Hinds' brother, Brad Hinds, who died of a heart attack on December 4, 2010 while hunting. Once More 'Round the Sun, like its predecessor, is not a concept album. It features themes such as relationships, struggles and hardships. The album was based on the various events that took place in each band member's lives the year before the album release. Emperor of Sand mainly deals with the themes of death and survival and is about a desert wanderer faced with a death sentence. The lyrics were inspired by the friends and family members of the band who were diagnosed with cancer. ==Visual art== ===Artwork=== A Mastodon backdrop in 2006, showcasing an elaborate painting, using the Leviathan artwork by the painter Paul Romano Artist Paul Romano was responsible for all of the band's album art and backdrops up to 2011. The artwork for the band's fifth studio album The Hunter was made by AJ Fosik, a woodcarver who was also responsible for the backdrop the band used live at the time. Oakland-based artist Skinner, who, in his own words, specializes in \\"psychedelic nightmare paintings\\", has taken the reins on Once More 'Round the Sun. \\"It's going to be a work of art for sure. It's going to be very eye- opening\\", said bassist Troy Sanders before the album's release. \\"Very striking. It's from another dimension, and a lot of our music is geared toward that idea‚Äîtaking you to another planet on songs. It's out there, and I think it's incredible.\\" ===Live presentation=== Following their first tours in the early 2000s, Mastodon have performed at many major festivals such as Download, Roskilde, Coachella, Bonnaroo, Big Day Out, Rock Werchter, Pinkpop, Metaltown, Ottawa Bluesfest, Sonisphere and Soundwave.

In Canada, there was some level of debate over participation in the U.S. missile defense program. Many Canadians felt that the program would do great damage to international peace and security by creating a new arms race among the great powers. This viewpoint was shared by many who feared the increasingly aggressive U.S. foreign policy under George W. Bush, and who resented the suggestion that Canada may not have an independent foreign policy. Many also opposed the system because of the doubts of some physicists about the effectiveness of the system. In his first visit to Canada shortly after winning his second U.S. election, President Bush surprised Prime Minister Paul Martin by making a speech calling on Canada to join the program and invoking the memory of former Prime Minister W.L. Mackenzie King's response to Nazi Germany. The Canadian Department of National Defence had mixed feelings about participation in the program. It wished to retain the current level of Canadian involvement in North American air defence through NORAD, but was reluctant to see scarce military funds spent on a single large research and development project of dubious practical value. There was a widespread feeling in Canada that failure to participate in the program would mean being shut out of American defense planning, something that would not be in the Canadian national interest. Others feared that rejection of the plan would lead to a cooling of Canada-U.S. relations, and might even lead to reprisals. Thus, while some Canadians were unsure about the viability of the system, many supported joining for diplomatic reasons. Opponents of involvement replied that Canada must have the courage to oppose the system on moral grounds, even if this decision proved to have negative consequences. They contended that it was important for Canada to reestablish its voice in the international arena by pushing for global disarmament and a revitalization of the United Nations. ==External links== * The Problem With Canada‚Äôs Ballistic Missile Defence Debate, by Andrea Berger, Matt Korda, Canadian International Council, Oct 4, 2017 *Canada funds Europe-based missile defence program but won't join one at home.

Originally built in 1915 for the firm Wittenberg and Son. The factory system is a method of manufacturing using machinery and division of labour. Because of the high capital cost of machinery and factory buildings, factories were typically privately owned by wealthy individuals who employed the operative labour. Use of machinery with the division of labour reduced the required skill level of workers and also increased the output per worker. The factory system was first adopted in Britain at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the late eighteenth century and later spread around the world.Walker 1993, pp. 187‚Äì88. It replaced the putting-out system (domestic system). The main characteristic of the factory system is the use of machinery, originally powered by water or steam and later by electricity. Other characteristics of the system mostly derive from the use of machinery or economies of scale, the centralization of factories, and standardization of interchangeable parts. ==Characteristics== The defining characteristics of the factory system are: * The factory system is considered a form of production. The operative labour generally does not own a significant share of the enterprise. The capitalist owners provide all machinery, buildings, management and administration, raw or semi-finished materials and are responsible for the sale of all production, as well as any resulting losses. * Use of unskilled labour ‚Äì Before the factory some systems had many products such as shoes and muskets were made by skilled craftsmen who usually custom-made an entire article. In contrast, factories practiced division of labour, in which most workers were either low skilled labourers who tended or operated machinery, or unskilled labourers who moved materials, semi-finished and finished goods. There were a few skilled mechanics. Division of labour was also practiced by the putting out system in which, for example, pieces of leather were cut off- site and brought to a central shop to be made into shoes or other articles. * Economies of scale ‚Äì Factories produced products on a much larger scale than the putting out or crafts systems. Because factories could oversupply local markets, access to transportation was important so that goods could be widely distributed. Factories used far less manpower per unit of production and therefore lowered product cost. * Location ‚Äì Before the widespread use of steam engines and railroads, most factories were located at water power sites and near water transportation. Railroads became widespread (itself a consequence of steam power becoming more efficient and affordable), so factories could be located away from water power sites but nearer railroads. * Centralization ‚Äì The cost and complexity of machinery, especially that powered by water or steam, was more than cottage industry workers could afford or had the skills to maintain. The exception was the sewing machine, which allowed putting out of sewing to continue for decades after the rise of factories. Home spinning and weaving were displaced in the years following the introduction of factory production, especially as distribution became easier. :Workers and machines were brought together in a central factory complex specially designed to handle the machinery and flow of materials. Although the earliest factories were usually all under one roof, different operations might be done on different floors. (Multi-story buildings were common because they facilitated transmission of power through line shafts.) In large factories, such as Baldwin locomotive works, different processes were performed in different buildings. :Foundry and blacksmith operations were normally kept in a separate building for reasons of safety, cleanliness and health.* 0:The efficiency of steam engines increases with size. Because of this, the smallest steam engines were about 2 horsepower, which was larger than needed by most workshops. Consequently until electrification in the 1910s and 1920s most workshops relied on manual power or rented space in power buildings which provided a centrally powered line shaft. * Standardization and uniformity ‚Äì Components were made to standard specifications, such as soles, heels and uppers for shoes themselves made to uniform sizes. Uniformity was mainly due to the precision possible from machinery, but also, quality was overseen by management. The quality of many machine operations such as sewing was superior to hand methods. Near the end of the nineteenth century metal interchangeable parts became widely used. * Guarantee of supply ‚Äì Factories were able to produce and distribute a steady supply of goods. Workers were paid either daily wages or for piece work, either in the form of money or some combination of money, housing, meals and goods from a company store (the truck system). Piece work presented accounting difficulties, especially as volumes increased and workers did a narrower scope of work on each piece. Piece work went out of flavor with the advent of the production line, which was designed on standard times for each operation in the sequence, and workers had to keep up with the work flow. ==History== New Lanark mill ===Mills=== One of the earliest factories was John Lombe's water-powered silk mill at Derby, operational by 1721. By 1746, an integrated brass mill was working at Warmley near Bristol. Raw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into pans, pins, wire, and other goods. Housing was provided for workers on site. Josiah Wedgwood in Staffordshire and Matthew Boulton at his Soho Manufactory were other prominent early industrialists, who employed the factory system. ===Cotton spinning=== The factory system began widespread use somewhat later when cotton spinning was mechanized. The first use of an integrated system, where cotton came in and was spun, bleached dyed and woven into finished cloth, was at mills in Waltham and Lowell, Massachusetts. These became known as Lowell Mills and the Waltham-Lowell system. The Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company's Bridgewater Foundry, which began operation in 1836, was one of the earliest factories to use modern materials handling such as cranes and rail tracks through the buildings for handling heavy items. ===Arkwright=== Cromford mill as it is today. Richard Arkwright is the person credited with being the brains behind the growth of factories and the Derwent Valley Mills. After he patented his water frame in 1769, he established Cromford Mill, in Derbyshire, England. The factory system was a new way of organizing labour made necessary by the development of machines which were too large to house in a worker's cottage. Working hours were as long as they had been for the farmer, that is, from dawn to dusk, six days per week. Overall, this practice essentially reduced skilled and unskilled workers to replaceable commodities. ===Machine tools and interchangeable parts=== An early instance of transition from skilled craftsmen to machine tools began in the late eighteenth century. In 1774, John Wilkinson invented a method for boring cannon barrels that were straight and true every time. He adapted this method to bore piston cylinders in the steam engines of James Watt. This boring machine has been called the first machine tool.. Reprinted by McGraw-Hill, New York and London, 1926 (); and by Lindsay Publications, Inc., Bradley, Illinois, (). Mass production using interchangeable parts was first achieved in 1803 by Marc Isambard Brunel in cooperation with Henry Maudslay, and Simon Goodrich, under the management of (with contributions by) Brigadier-General Sir Samuel Bentham, the Inspector General of Naval Works at Portsmouth Block Mills at Portsmouth Dockyard, for the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic War. By 1808 annual production had reached 130,000 sailing blocks......... (copies available from the British Thesis service of the British Library).. This method of working did not catch on in general manufacturing in Britain for many decades, and when it did it was imported from America, becoming known as the American system of manufacturing, even though it originated in England. ==Societal effects== Much manufacturing in the 18th century was carried out in homes under the domestic or putting-out system, especially the weaving of cloth and spinning of thread and yarn, often with just a single loom or spinning wheel. As these devices were mechanized, machine made goods were able to underprice the cottagers, leaving them unable to earn enough to make their effort worthwhile. Other products such as nails had long been produced in factory workshops, increasingly diversified using the division of labour to increase the efficiency of the system. Factory workers typically lived within walking distance to work until the introduction of bicycles and electric street railways in the 1890s. Thus the factory system was partly responsible for the rise of urban living, as large numbers of workers migrated into the towns in search of employment in the factories. Many mills had to provide dormitories for workers, especially for girls and women. The transition to industrialisation was not without difficulty. For example, a group of English workers known as Luddites formed to protest against industrialisation and sometimes sabotaged factories. They continued an already established tradition of workers opposing labour saving machinery. Numerous inventors in the textile industry such as John Kay and Samuel Crompton, suffered harassment when developing their machines or devices. The Soho Manufactory in 1800. In other industries the transition to factory production was not so divisive. Until the late nineteenth century it was common to work 12 hours a day, six days a week in most factories; however long hours were also common outside factories. Debate arose concerning the morality of the system, as workers complained about unfair working conditions prior to the passage of labour laws. One of the problems was women's labour; in many cases women were paid not much more than a quarter of what men made. Child labour was also a major part of the system. However, in the early nineteenth century, education was not compulsory and in many families having children work was necessary due to low incomes (Samuel Slater employed children but was required to provide basic education). Children commonly did farm labour and produced goods for the household. Besides working in factories children worked in mines. Automation in the late 19th century is credited with displacing child labour, with the automatic glass bottle blowing machine (c. 1890) cited as an example, having been said to do more to end child labour than child labour laws. Years of schooling began to increase sharply from the end of the nineteenth century. Some industrialists themselves tried to improve factory and living conditions for their workers. One of the earliest such reformers was Robert Owen, known for his pioneering efforts in improving conditions for workers at the New Lanark mills, and often regarded as one of the key thinkers of the early socialist movement. Karl Marx worried that the capitalist system would eventually lead to wages only sufficient for subsistence due to the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Subsistence wages were indeed the case in parts of England. The British Agricultural Revolution had been reducing the need for labour on farms for over a century and these workers were forced to sell their labour wherever they could. Conditions were particularly bad during the depression years of the late 1830s to early 1840s. The depression was immediately followed by the Irish famine of 1845‚Äì50 which brought large numbers of Irish immigrants to seek work in the English and American factories. One of the best known accounts of factory workers‚Äô living conditions during the Industrial Revolution is Friedrich Engels' The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844. By the late 1880s, Engels noted that the extreme poverty and lack of sanitation he wrote about in 1844 had largely disappeared.Preface to the later editions (post 1887) of Conditions of the Working Class in England in 1844 ==See also== * Adam Smith * Arnold Toynbee * Assembly line * Mass production * Mechanization * Productivity improving technologies (historical) ==References== * Category:Industrial Revolution Category:History of manufacturing ","title":"Factory system"},{"id":"1428812","text":"Porkhov () is a town and the administrative center of Porkhovsky District in Pskov Oblast, Russia, located on the Shelon River, east of Pskov, the administrative center of the oblast.

The timber fortress was sacked by Algirdas (Olgierd) in 1356 and fell in flames in 1387. The Novgorod Republic immediately rebuilt its fortifications in limestone downstream. In 1428, Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas destroyed the western wall by artillery fire and entered Porkhov. Two years later, the Novgorodians augmented the fortress and rebuilt its walls. After the fall of Novgorod to the Muscovites in 1478, the fortress lost its military importance. Porkhov was the second most important town of Shelon Pyatina, after Russa.

Yasgur (December 15, 1919 ‚Äì February 9, 1973) was an American farmer. He was the owner of the 600-acre dairy farm in Bethel, New York, at which the Woodstock Music and Art Fair was held between August 15 and August 18, 1969. ==Personal life and dairy farming== Yasgur was born in New York City to Russian Jewish immigrants Samuel and Bella Yasgur.U.S. Census, January 1, 1920, State of New York, County of New York, enumeration district 701, p. 8-A, family 200. He was raised with his brother Isidore (1926-2010) on the family's farm (where his parents also ran a small hotel) and attended New York University, studying real estate law. By the late 1960s, he was the largest milk producer in Sullivan County, New York. His farm had 650 cows, mostly Guernseys. At the time of the festival in 1969, Yasgur was married to Miriam (Mimi) Gertrude Miller Yasgur (1920‚Äì2014) and had a son, Sam (1942‚Äì2016) and daughter Lois (1944‚Äì1977). His son was an assistant district attorney in New York City at the time. In later years, it was revealed that Yasgur was in fact a conservative Republican who supported the Vietnam War. Nevertheless, he felt that the Woodstock festival could help business at his farm and also tame the generation gap. Despite claims that he showed disapproval towards the treatment of the counterculture movement, this has not been confirmed. Woodstock promoter Michael Lang, who considered Yasgur to be his \\"hero,\\" stated that Yasgur was \\"the antithesis\\" of what the Woodstock festival stood for. Yasgur's early death prevented him from answering questions about why the festival took place. == Woodstock Festival== After area villages Saugerties (located about from Yasgur's farm) and Wallkill declined to provide a venue for the festival, Yasgur leased one of his farm's fields for a fee that festival sponsors said was $10,000. Soon afterward he began to receive both threatening and supporting phone calls (which could not be placed without the assistance of an operator because the community of White Lake, New York, where the telephone exchange was located, still utilized manual switching). Some of the calls threatened to burn him out. However, the helpful calls outnumbered the threatening ones. Opposition to the festival began soon after the festival's relocation to Bethel was announced. Signs were erected around town, saying, \\"Local People Speak Out Stop Max's Hippie Music Festival. No 150,000 hippies here\\" and \\"Buy no milk\\" Yasgur was 49 at the time of the festival and had a heart condition. He said at the time that he never expected the festival to be so large, but that \\"if the generation gap is to be closed, we older people have to do more than we have done.\\" Yasgur quickly established a rapport with the concert-goers, providing food at cost or for free. When he heard that some local residents were reportedly selling water to people coming to the concert, he put up a big sign at his barn on New York State Route 17B reading \\"Free Water.\\" The New York Times reported that Yasgur \\"slammed a work- hardened fist on the table and demanded of some friends, 'How can anyone ask money for water?'\\" His son Sam recalled his father telling his children to \\"take every empty milk bottle from the plant, fill them with water and give them to the kids, and give away all the milk and milk products we had at the dairy.\\" At the time of the concert, friends described Yasgur as an individualist who was motivated as much by his principles as by the money. According to Sam Yasgur, his father agreed to rent the field to the festival organizers because it was a very wet year, which curtailed hay production. The income from the rental would offset the cost of purchasing thousands of bales of hay. Yasgur also believed strongly in freedom of expression, and was angered by the hostility of some townspeople toward \\"anti-war hippies\\". Hosting the festival became, for him, a \\"cause\\". On the second day of the festival, just before Joe Cocker's early afternoon set, Yasgur addressed the crowd: His speech was met with a massive cheer from the audience. == After Woodstock == Many of his neighbors turned against him after the festival, and he was no longer welcome at the town general store, but he never regretted his decision to allow the concert on his farm. On January 7, 1970, he was sued by his neighbors for property damage caused by the concert attendees. However, the damage to his own property was far more extensive and, over a year later, he received a $50,000 settlement to pay for the near-destruction of his dairy farm. He refused to rent out his farm for a 1970 revival of the festival, saying, \\"As far as I know, I'm going back to running a dairy farm\\". In 1971, Yasgur sold the farm, and moved to Marathon, Florida, where, a year and a half later, he died of a heart attack at the age of 53. He was given a full-page obituary in Rolling Stone magazine, one of the few non-musicians to have received such an honor. In 1997, the site of the concert and surrounding it was purchased by Alan Gerry for the purpose of creating the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts. In August 2007, the parcel that contains Yasgur's former homestead, about three miles from the festival site, was placed on the market for $8 million by its owner, Roy Howard. ==In popular culture== *Joni Mitchell's song \\"Woodstock\\", made famous by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (also covered by Matthews Southern Comfort, Richie Havens, James Taylor, Eva Cassidy, and Brooke Fraser), sings about \\"going down to Yasgur's Farm\\". *In addition, Mountain (who were also at the festival) recorded a song shortly after the event entitled \\"For Yasgur's Farm\\". *The Beastie Boys 1989 album Paul's Boutique samples Yasgur's Woodstock speech on the track 'Car Thief'. *The progressive rock band Moon Safari has a song titled \\"Yasgur's Farm\\" on their album Blomljud. *Yasgur is portrayed by Eugene Levy in Ang Lee's film Taking Woodstock.

He also represented the sixth district of Maryland in the U.S. House of Representatives. Born in Cumberland, Maryland to a father and mother from Hesse and Bavaria, respectively, Wellington attended a German school with some private instruction. He went on to be a clerk in the Second National Bank of Cumberland in 1870 and later was a teller. From 1882 to 1888 and 1890, Wellington was treasurer of Allegany County, Maryland. He unsuccessfully ran for Comptroller of Maryland in 1889, but was chosen as the assistant treasurer of the United States at Baltimore, Maryland from 1890 to 1893. Wellington was unsuccessful in his campaign to be elected to the 53rd Congress in 1892, but two years later, in 1894, was elected as a Republican to the 54th Congress. After serving one term, he was elected to the United States Senate in 1896, serving one term from 1897 to 1903, choosing not to run for re-election in 1902. As senator, he was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee to Establish a University of the United States (55th and 56th Congresses). On September 4, 1900, Wellington formally withdrew from the Republican Party and supported Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan (who was running against Pres. William McKinley for the second consecutive time). The September 5, 1900 edition of The New York Times described it thus: \\"CUMBERLAND, Maryland, Sept 4.‚ÄîIn a Speech delivered here to-night, in the presence of William J. Bryan, who afterward spoke from the same platform. United States Senator George L. Wellington of this State announced his opposition to the present Republican Administration, and his determination to support Mr. Bryan. He said he had taken this position against the party which had elected him Senator because of his views upon the Spanish war and its consequences, and because of his opposition to imperialism. Senator \\"Wellington was listened to with interest, and was frequently applauded, although at times there were very pronounced hisses. In the course of his speech he said: 'As the Governmental policy of President McKinley was developed I was compelled to differ from it at several points and gave evidence of my disagreement in the speeches delivered by me during the last three years vpon the floor of the Senate, touching the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican war, the Philippine Islands, Porto Rico, and the South African affairs. I am here to-night to reiterate the convictions I voiced in the Senate and record my opposition to the principles of President McKinley as evidenced in his foreign policy and protest against the violation of the principles upon which our Government is founded, against the desecration of the Constitution, and the reversal of the policy which has given us a century and a quarter of National life.'\\" In 1913, Wellington again sought election as senator, but as a member of the Progressive Party. He was not elected and, following the election, he engaged in civic activities. He became president of two banks and held an interest in the electric railways and electric companies in his hometown of Cumberland. Wellington died in Cumberland, and is buried at Rose Hill Cemetery. ==References== Category:1852 births Category:1927 deaths Category:People from Cumberland, Maryland Category:American people of German descent Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives from Maryland Category:Republican Party United States senators from Maryland Category:Maryland Progressives (1912) Category:Burials at Rose Hill Cemetery (Cumberland, Maryland) ","title":"George L.

The official Star Trek website defines canon as comprising the television series and feature films of the franchise. ==Television series== As a rule, all Star Trek television series that aired are considered part of the canon. This policy does not make clear which version of the series is the canonical one. For example, the remastered episodes of the original series, released in 2006, present several visual differences from the episodes originally aired. ===Roddenberry's impact=== Gene Roddenberry was something of a revisionist when it came to canonicity. People who worked with Roddenberry remember that he used to handle canonicity not on a series-by-series basis nor an episode-by-episode basis, but point by point. If he changed his mind on something, or if a fact in one episode contradicted what he considered to be a more important fact in another episode, he had no problem declaring that specific point not canonical. Additionally, David Gerrold, in an interview about Star Trek: The Animated Series, commented on Roddenberry's parsimony and how it originally affected the Star Treks canon: ===From non-canon to canon=== Occasionally, writers will draw from non-canonical works in creating new canon. Such is the case of the first names for Hikaru Sulu and Nyota Uhura, which were first used in the novel The Entropy Effect and the reference book Star Trek II Biographies, respectively. Several concepts that first appeared in The Animated Series, which was considered to be non-canon for a couple of decades (1980s-2000s),\\"Do you think the Animated series should be considered canon? Or even more so, IS the Animated Series canon?\\" \\"We don't consider it canon, but it's kinda cool to throw in the odd reference here and there.\\" - Ronald D. Moore, AOL's \\"Ask Ron D.

URL retrieved June 16, 2007. ===Unreadable text=== One final issue comes from text that appears on props such as computer displays, but is not legible during the episode, except in modern HDTV broadcasts. The transcript of the text can often be obtained through behind-the-scenes pictures and interviews. This leads to the question of whether material that is in the episodes but cannot be seen clearly should be considered canon. Often, this material tends to be inside jokes inserted by the production staff. Other kinds of information, such as the biographical information seen on a computer display in the Enterprise episode \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\", has been stated to not be \\"hard canon\\".\\"I wouldn't really consider any of this 'hard canon,' so take it all with a grain of salt. Both bios were slapped together hastily and weren't approved by the exec producers.\\" - Mike Sussman, Enterprise Producer, TrekBBS posts, April 30, 2005. ==Films== All official Star Trek feature films are also considered canonical. While not explicitly stated, the most complete released version of the films, including scenes missing from the theatrical version of a film but included in home releases or director's cuts, appear to be canonical. One scene, deleted from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, revealed Peter Preston as the nephew of Scotty.\\"The \\"Director's Edition\\" version of the film is not substantively longer than the original theatrical release, as he pointed out during last week's gala premiere at Paramount. But there were certain short scenes that Meyer felt needed to be restored. A couple of those scenes involve Midshipman Peter Preston in Engineering, with dialog establishing Preston as Scotty's nephew (\\"my sister's youngest\\").\\" Spotlight: Meyer Speaks Proudly of \\"Khan\\" article at the official Star Trek website. URL retrieved June 16, 2007. Peter Preston is included in the canon database at StarTrek.com.Peter Preston entry at the official Star Trek website. URL retrieved March 31, 2013. Adding confusion to the issue is the fact that Roddenberry is quoted as saying he disliked the films, and \\"didn't much consider them canon\\". There exists no definitive list of which films in particular Roddenberry disliked, or what elements in them he did not consider canonical. For example, the reference book Star Trek Chronology states that Roddenberry considered elements of Star Trek V and Star Trek VI to be apocryphal, but it does not specify which particular elements in the films Roddenberry objected to. The canonicity of extra features found on home DVD releases, such as deleted scenes, has never been explicitly addressed. ===\\"Reboot\\" films (Kelvin Timeline)=== Star Trek (the 2009 film), Into Darkness and Beyond occur in a separate timeline from the rest of the series. In June 2016, for the computer game Star Trek Online, CBS has named this the Kelvin Timeline, named after the USS Kelvin which was attacked and destroyed in the opening scene of Star Trek. Former names for this universe have included the alternate timeline and the reboot series. ==Publications== ===Original tie-in novels=== Many of the original novels published by Pocket Books are not considered part of the canon. This was a guideline set early on by Gene Roddenberry, and repeated many times by people who worked with him. > And as long as Gene Roddenberry is involved in it, he is the final word on > what is Star Trek. So, for us here ‚Äì Ron Moore, Jeri Taylor, everybody who > works on the show ‚Äì Gene is the authority. And when he says that the books, > and the games, and the comics and everything else, are not gospel, but are > only additional Star Trek based on his Star Trek but not part of the actual > Star Trek universe that he created... they're just, you know, kinda fun to > keep you occupied between episodes and between movies, whatever... but he > does not want that to be considered to be sources of information for > writers, working on this show, he doesn't want it to be considered part of > the canon by anybody working on any other projects.‚Äî Richard Arnold, 1991 However, even this rule is not without rare exceptions. Two Voyager novels written by Jeri Taylor (co-creator and then producer of Voyager), Mosaic and Pathways, were written early on in Voyagers run and detailed the background of the series' main characters. These were meant to be canon, and to be used as references by the series' writers when fleshing out the characters. These two novels are sometimes named as exceptions to the \\"no book is canon\\" rule.\\"Only the reference books (tech manual, encyclopedia, etc...) and two books by Jeri Taylor are considered canon outside the TV show and movies.\\" - Harry Lang, Senior Director of Viacom Consumer Products Interactive division, posts on StarTrek.com forum, January 2005. However, as some of the background information mentioned in those books was never referenced in an episode of Voyager, or was contradicted in episodes written after they were published, their status as canon is still open to debate. ===Novelizations=== The novelizations of episodes and movies are not considered canon. This is a tradition that also goes back to Roddenberry himself. His novelization of Star Trek: The Motion Picture includes many tangents and new information. It reveals, for instance, that the woman who dies in the transporter accident was Kirk's former spouse. While this novel filled in many gaps left in the movie, Roddenberry is quoted as saying it should not be considered canon.\\"The novelization that Gene wrote himself, of Star Trek: the Motion Picture, he does not consider canon either, because he also went off on tangents, that he said that it's okay for individual writers to do that, and he certainly had some fun with it himself, filling in parts of the puzzle that he never would've been able to do on film, it would've been a ten-hour movie, but he doesn't want even that used for canon, because otherwise, where do you draw the line? Which books are accepted and which aren't?\\" - Richard Arnold, Star Trek: The Next Generation research consultant and Star Trek archivist, 1991 interview with Tim Lynch. ===Reference books=== There are conflicting messages concerning \\"non-fiction\\" reference books such as The Star Trek Encyclopedia, Star Trek Chronology, Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual. Unlike the novels and novelizations, these reference manuals have never been explicitly named as non-canon, and the fact that they were officially sanctioned by Paramount and given to episode writers as guides serves to give them an aura of credibility. Roddenberry himself considered it part of the \\"background\\" of Star Trek.\\"Documents such as this Technical Manual help give some background to the vision we work so hard to create on Star Trek. Rick and Mike have obviously had a lot of fun filling in the gaps and trying to find technical 'explanations' for some of our mistakes.\\" - Gene Roddenberry, Introduction to the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual Meanwhile, Michael Okuda and Rick Sternbach, artists and technical consultants since Star Trek: The Next Generation and the authors of several of these reference books, considered their work \\"pretty official\\".\\"How 'official' is this stuff? Well, this is the first technical manual done by folks who actually work on Star Trek. It's closely based on source material we've developed in conjunction with our writers and producers in our role as technical consultants for the series. In that sense it can be considered pretty 'official'.\\" - Mike Okuda and Rick Sternbach, Introduction to the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual However, they stop short of naming the books canon, leaving the debate open. Star Trek writer and co-producer Ronald D. Moore dismisses such official material as \\"speculation\\", and says that the writing staff did not consider it canon.\\"You have to remember that things like CD-ROMs and the various \\"official\\" manuals put out by Paramount are not done in conjunction with the writing/producing staffs and that the authors are usually simply extrapolating information based on what's actually been seen on screen.\\" - Ronald D. Moore, AOL's \\"Ask Ron D. Moore\\" message board, July 1998\\"We do use things like the Encyclopedia, the Chronology, the Technical Manual etc. for reference, but unless it was explicitly mentioned on screen, we won't feel bound by anything stated even in those books.\\" - Ronald D. Moore, Star Trek Continuum message board posting, September 1998. However, CBS Corporation, the parent company of Paramount, seems to believe differently. In a series of posts to the official Star Trek website's forums, Viacom Senior Director Harry Lang left no doubt that he considers the reference books as canon.\\"The tech manuals are written by ST production staff, same as the Encyclopedia (Mike Okuda). Since their contents report on what is canon, they are technically canon.\\" - Harry Lang, Senior Director of Viacom Consumer Products Interactive division, posts on StarTrek.com forum, January 2005. ===Other publications=== Star Trek comic books and magazines are generally not considered part of the canon. Regarding IDW Publishing's comic book tie-ins to the 2009 film and its sequel, screenwriter Roberto Orci felt that the background information conveyed in those books could be considered canonically accurate. Using rules similar to the ones that governed Star Wars canon at the time, he acknowledged that the extended universe material he oversees could remain part of the accepted canon unless contradicted by future films or television series.Exclusive: Orci Says Star Trek TV Talks Getting Real + Declares Movie Tie-in Comics & Game As Canon. TrekMovie. Retrieved on May 10, 2014. ==Other material== Nothing that takes place in Star Trek games, the Star Trek: The Experience attraction, Star Trek fan productions or Trekdom is considered part of the canon. ===Roddenberry-approved material=== Based on the amount of creative control Roddenberry exerted over the first seasons of Star Trek, some people argue that only Roddenberry-approved material should be considered canonical.\\"Gene rewrote virtually every Star Trek script for the first two seasons, often working around the clock, days at a time, to produce scripts that conformed to his view of what Star Trek was and could be. It was not unusual for Gene to be walking out of the studio in the morning as the actors were arriving. As Gene used to say, 'It isn‚Äôt Star Trek until I say it‚Äôs Star Trek.' This ability to synthesize and improve input from others, adding his own special insights and touches, is best illustrated in the famous opening that set the tone for the series.\\" - David Alexander, Star Trek Creator: The Authorized Biography of Gene Roddenberry, 1994. Such an approach would eliminate from the canon anything Roddenberry disliked, as well as everything made after his death, including seven movies and multiple television series. However, Roddenberry himself preemptively rebuked such an attitude. He had hoped that Star Trek would go on after his death.\\"I would hope there are bright young people, growing up all the time, who will bring to [Star Trek] levels and areas that were beyond me, and I don't feel jealous about that at all. [...] It'll go on, without any of us, and get better and better and better, because that's the... that really is the human condition. It's to improve and improve.\\" - Gene Roddenberry, The Star Trek Saga: From One Generation to the Next, 1988. As Star Trek was constantly improved by each following generation, he expected people to look back upon its humble beginnings as just that, the simple beginnings of something much bigger and better.\\"There's a good chance that when I'm gone, others will come along and do so well that people will say, 'Oh, that Roddenberry. He was never this good.' But I will be pleased with that statement.\\" - Gene Roddenberry, Los Angeles Times TV Times, article \\"Star Treks New Frontier\\", 1993. Roddenberry clearly never intended Star Trek to be limited to his work, but to include all the hopefully superior work of future generations. === Klingon language === The Klingon language was first conceived by James Doohan for the movie Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and consisted only of a few words. Later, Marc Okrand proceeded to flesh out the sparse vocabulary into a real language, complete with grammar rules and phonology, and went so far as to publish The Klingon Dictionary (1985, revised edition 1992); the Klingon Language Institute was created soon thereafter.About the Klingon Language article at the Klingon Language Institute.

Okrand has developed the language in an important way in two audio- courses: Conversational Klingon (1992) and Power Klingon (1993), and in two books: The Klingon Way (1996) and Klingon for the Galactic Traveller (1997). Despite these facts, however, Ronald D. Moore stated in 1997: \\"Whether or not [Trek writers] use the language as spelled out in Marc's dictionary is up to the individual writer,\\" and that he \\"find[s] the dictionary cumbersome and usually find[s] it easier to make [the language] up phonetically.\\" Ron D.

It was nationally syndicated throughout the United States in 1988 with reruns airing until 1990. In the show, a dinosaur hatches from a petrified egg in modern times, and is befriended by a group of teenagers. Episodes often focused on issues of conservation, ecology, and greed. The show ran for two seasons, as the dinosaur boom that had followed The Land Before Time waned until Jurassic Park in 1993, causing viewership to drop. The series received a recommendation from the National Education Association. A CG-animated reboot which originally went under the name Denver and Cliff premiered on M6 on August 27, 2018. The new series is produced by Zagtoon. ==Plot== The show revolves around the adventures of Denver, the eponymous last dinosaur, who was released from his egg by a group of California teens: Jeremy, Mario, Shades, Wally, and Casey, along with tag- along older sister, Heather. The kids taught Denver the finer points of skateboarding and other pastimes while protecting him from rock concert promoter Morton Fizzback who wanted to use the dinosaur to make money. The series begins when Jeremy, while preparing for his Natural History test, and his friends visit the La Brea Tar Pits ‚Äì a place in Los Angeles which contains a large collection of extinct animal and plant fossils - and go to the Museum there. At the museum, the friends encounter a gang of bullies. The friends escape the bullies by hiding behind a fence near the tar pits. Behind the fence they find a pit that contains a large prehistoric egg. As the friends are playing with the egg it suddenly cracks and a green friendly dinosaur emerges who, inexplicably, understands English. The kids name him Denver after they spot an advertisement for the city of Denver on a passing bus. The children decide to keep Denver and to keep his existence a secret. Denver is first hidden in a pool house at Wally's home. After Wally's sister discovers Denver they move Denver to the old school gym. After a while, Denver gets kidnapped by the manager Morton Fizzback, who puts Denver on a stage in front of an audience to become rich. When the children confront Morton about his abduction, he becomes paranoid that someone might find out that Denver is a real dinosaur. At the end, Denver is sold to a scientist named Professor Funt, who wants to examine and experiment on him, and use him to become famous. Eventually, Denver gets to return to the gang and rescue them from Nick and his thugs. In addition to his natural skills and abilities, Denver can also, with the help of a piece from the shell of his egg, take the gang with him back to the time whence he came. ==Characters== ===Main characters=== *Denver the Last Dinosaur is the main protagonist of the show and a close friend of the gang.

Petroleum products are materials derived from crude oil (petroleum) as it is processed in oil refineries. Unlike petrochemicals, which are a collection of well-defined usually pure chemical compounds, petroleum products are complex mixtures. The majority of petroleum is converted to petroleum products, which includes several classes of fuels.Walther W. Irion, Otto S. Neuwirth, \\"Oil Refining\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. According to the composition of the crude oil and depending on the demands of the market, refineries can produce different shares of petroleum products. The largest share of oil products is used as \\"energy carriers\\", i.e. various grades of fuel oil and gasoline. These fuels include or can be blended to give gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, heating oil, and heavier fuel oils. Heavier (less volatile) fractions can also be used to produce asphalt, tar, paraffin wax, lubricating and other heavy oils. Refineries also produce other chemicals, some of which are used in chemical processes to produce plastics and other useful materials. Since petroleum often contains a few percent sulfur-containing molecules, elemental sulfur is also often produced as a petroleum product. Carbon, in the form of petroleum coke, and hydrogen may also be produced as petroleum products. The hydrogen produced is often used as an intermediate product for other oil refinery processes such as hydrocracking and hydrodesulfurization. == Specialty and By products == A breakdown of the products made from a typical barrel of US oil.U.S. Energy Information Administration > Petroleum > Navigator > Refinery Yield Oil refineries will blend various feedstocks, mix appropriate additives, provide short-term storage, and prepare for bulk loading to trucks, barges, product ships, and railcars. *Gaseous like propane, methane are stored in the petroleum . *Liquid fuels blending (producing automotive and aviation grades of gasoline, kerosene, various aviation turbine fuels, and diesel fuels, adding dyes, detergents, antiknock additives, oxygenates, and anti-fungal compounds as required).

A serious health concern is that toluene may have an effect on your nervous system (brain and nerves). Nervous system effects can be temporary, such as headaches, dizziness, or unconsciousness. However, effects such as incoordination, cognitive impairment, and vision and hearing loss may become permanent with repeated exposure, especially at high levels associated with intentional solvent abuse. High levels of toluene exposure during pregnancy, such as those associated with solvent abuse, may lead to developmental effects, such as retardation of mental abilities and growth in children.

McCammon, first published in the 1984 collection Masques. ==Plot== State trooper Dennis Wells takes shelter from a downpour at a roadside diner. As other customers arrive during the storm, he describes a massacre that he is investigating that occurred at a local motel. The diner patrons witness a near-collision between two cars on the road outside, and a Vietnam veteran named Price enters the diner. While Price is having coffee, he asks for a cold beer but the cook Bob tells him that the diner does not have a liquor license. When Price laments how a cold beer would taste good, a can of beer appears in his hand; when he comments that beer would only make him sleepy, it vanishes. Wells strikes up a conversation with Price, lamenting that he wishes he could have gone to Vietnam. Price is compelled to describe how he fled and abandoned his unit during the war, condemning all of them to die in the jungle, and he relays that he often dreams a reoccurring nightmare in which his unit, \\"The Nightcrawlers,\\" are hunting him down to exact revenge. Price explains that he and the other soldiers were sprayed with some kind of chemical that gave them the power of mind over matter, which he demonstrates by materializing a t-bone steak on the grill. The trooper, who suspects Price is a dangerous troublemaker, who may be responsible for the motel massacre, pulls his gun on Price but Price melts it with his mind. Wells then knocks Price unconscious. The diner patrons and staff then begin to experience Price's nightmare: ghost- like soldiers materialize, destroy vehicles in the parking lot, and then force their way inside the diner killing Wells. Price regains consciousness and finds a spotlight has been cast upon him. He then calls out \\"Charlie's in the light!\\" and the soldiers react by firing their rifles and killing him, thus ending the attack. As Bob the cook is being taken away in an ambulance, he reminds the others that Price said there were still four more soldiers out there who had the same ability. ==Production== \\"Nightcrawlers\\" was based on a short story by Robert R. McCammon. It was scored by Merl Saunders and the Grateful Dead, featuring Huey Lewis on harmonica.

It was completed in 1979,Mark Duguid \\"Long Good Friday, The (1979)\\", BFI Screenonline but because of release delays, it is generally credited as an 80s film. The storyline weaves together events and concerns of the late 1970s, including mid-level political and police corruption, IRA fund-raising, displacement of traditional British industry by property development, UK membership of the EEC, and the free-market economy. The film was voted at number 21 in the British Film Institute's list of the \\"BFI Top 100 British films\\" list, and provided Bob Hoskins with his breakthrough film role. In 2016, British film magazine Empire ranked The Long Good Friday number 19 in their list of \\"The 100 best British films\\". ==Plot== A man named Colin delivers money to an unknown destination in Belfast, taking some of the cash in the process. The recipients realise that money is missing but are then attacked. Soon afterwards, the delivery driver is kidnapped and killed. Later, Colin is murdered whilst swimming. Harold Shand, a London gangster, is aspiring to become a legitimate businessman and is trying to form a partnership with the American Mafia, with a plan to redevelop London Docklands. Shand's world is suddenly destabilised by the murders. He and his henchmen try to uncover his attackers' identities whilst simultaneously trying not to worry their visitors, fearing the Americans will abandon him if they think he's not in full control. Shand's girlfriend, Victoria, tells the Mafia representatives he is under attack from an unknown enemy, but assures them Shand is working to quickly resolve the crisis. She starts to suspect Shand's right hand man, Jeff, knows more about who is behind the attacks than he claims. After some investigation, Shand confronts Jeff, who confesses he sent Shand's friend Colin to Belfast to deliver money raised by Irish Navvies to the IRA. He explains that three of the IRA's top men were killed on the same night after discovering some of the money had been stolen. Shand realises the IRA have come to the conclusion that he sold them out to the security forces and pocketed the missing cash for himself. Vowing to destroy the terrorist organisation in London, Shand loses his temper and kills Jeff in a frenzy. Shand sets up a meeting with the IRA's London leadership. He ostensibly offers them ¬£60,000 in return for a ceasefire but double crosses them and has them shot as they are counting the cash. Believing his enemies are dead, Shand travels to the Savoy Hotel to triumphantly inform his Mafia partners only to find the Americans preparing to leave, having been spooked by the carnage. In response to their derisory comments about the UK, Shand berates them for their arrogance and dismisses them as cowards. Leaving the hotel, Shand steps into his chauffeur-driven car only to find it has been commandeered by IRA assassins. As the car speeds to an unknown destination, Shand contemplates the inevitability of his fate. ==Cast== * Bob Hoskins as Harold Shand * P. H.

Under the title \\"The Paddy Factor\\",Bloody Business: The Making of The Long Good Friday, documentary film, 2006 the original story had been written by Keeffe for Hanson when the latter worked for Euston Films, a subsidiary of Thames Television. Euston did not make the film, but Hanson bought the rights from Euston for his own company Calendar Films. Although Hanson designed the film for the cinema and all contracts were negotiated under a film, not a TV agreement, the production was eventually financed by Black Lion, a subsidiary of Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment for transmission via Grade's ATV on the ITV Network. The film was commissioned by Charles Denton, at the time both Programme Controller of ATV and Managing Director of Black Lion. After Grade saw the finished film, he allegedly objected to what he saw as the glorification of the IRA. The film was scheduled to be televised with heavy cuts on 24 March 1981. Because of the planned cuts, in late 1980, Hanson attempted to buy the film back from ITC to prevent ITV screening the film. The cuts, he said, would be \\"execrable\\" and added up to \\"about 75 minutes of film that was literal nonsense\\". It was also reported at the same time that Bob Hoskins was suing both Black Lion and Calendar Films to prevent their planned release of a US TV version in which Hoskins' voice would be dubbed by English Midlands actor David Daker. Before the planned ITV transmission the rights to the film were bought from ITC by George Harrison's company, Handmade Films, for around ¬£200,000 less than the production costs. They gave the film a cinema release.Robert Sellers, Always Look on the Bright Side of Life: The Inside Story of HandMade Films, Metro, 2003, pp. 56‚Äì70. ==Reception== As of July 2020, the film holds a rating of 96% from 28 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus: \\"Bob Hoskins commands a deviously sinister performance in The Long Good Friday -- a gangster flick with ferocious intelligence, tight plotting and razor-edged thrills.\\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_long_good_friday ==Sequel== Barrie Keeffe wrote a sequel, Black Easter Monday, set twenty years after the events of the first film. It opened with Bob Hoskins's character; Harold Shand, escaping from the IRA after the car was pulled over by police. Shand would retire to Jamaica, then return to stop the East End being taken over by the Yardies. However, the film was never made. ==References* * *The Long Good Friday an essay by Michael Sragow at the Criterion Collection Category:1980 films Category:1980s crime drama films Category:1980s mystery films Category:British films Category:British crime drama films Category:British mystery films Category:Edgar Award-winning works Category:British gangster films Category:Films about the Irish Republican Army Category:Films directed by John Mackenzie (film director) Category:Films set in London Category:HandMade Films Category:Murder in films Category:1980s gang films Category:1980 drama films ","title":"The Long Good Friday"},{"id":"1428877","text":"Botero is a surname of Spanish language origin common in Colombia.
