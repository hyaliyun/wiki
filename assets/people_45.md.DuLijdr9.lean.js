Their goal is to work for freedom and human rights, improve educational opportunities, and try to be helpful to those in need of a voice and a friend. == History== Restore International was founded in 2003 by Bob Goff after a trip to India where he witnessed extreme human rights violations. Restore India started with efforts to free those in bonded labor, human trafficking, or otherwise exploited. In 2006, they began working in Uganda in human rights and education. In March 2014 they launched a program in Somalia to improve educational opportunities, safety care for women and children, and feeding programs. In September 2014, Restore opened a school in Iraq as well as an orphanage in Nepal. In 2016, they rebranded to '\\"Love Does\\"' and continue to further their work in these countries. == Activities== The work of Love Does are divided into two major areas: education and human rights. Love Does activities include education, fighting human trafficking through investigations, surveillance, brothel raids, working with local law enforcement, and providing safety for women and children. Love Does works in India to prevent the sale and trafficking of underage children. It has helped stop forced prostitution in India by arresting over 80 criminals and placing the children in safe houses. In addition, Love Does also works in Northern Uganda,Speak With Your Life: A Witch Doctor, The White House and Charlie, Huffington Post a country that Goff holds the position of Honorary Consul. Seattle Times Love Does work in Uganda is focused around educating and empowering children. Love Does founded a school, Restore Leadership Academy, in Gulu, Uganda in 2007. Restore Leadership Academy first began with 30 students and expanded to over 500 students with 30 teachers. Love Does has been noted by Nicholas Kristof in his book A Path Appears , Random House in regards to their work in Uganda Restore International. Love Does hosted two Love Does conferences in Austin, Texas and Tacoma, Washington where 100% of the proceeds went to efforts in Uganda and India. ===Uganda=== Love Does has been working in Uganda since 2006, primarily to promote human rights and education. They started by asking Ugandans what the biggest need was at the time. Their answer was human rights and education, so Love Does got busy trying to be helpful in those areas. The educational aspect is not the only need addressed as Love Does has a safe house in Kampala,Uganda that has over 25+ girls living there. Love Does also holds weekly classes for more than 70 traditional healers to teach them basic literacy and anti human trafficking. Lastly, Love Does supports a program that sends 35 graduates of Restore Leadership Academy on to University. Restore Leadership Academy In 2007, Love Does started a secondary school in Gulu, Uganda. Many of the students were previous child soldiers, rescued from lives of forced sex trafficking, orphans, or from backgrounds of extreme poverty. From a tiny beginning, the school thrived on the vision to give these kids hope, a home and a fighting chance at success. As of 2017, there are 500+ students and 30 staff members in primary, middle and high school and Restore Leadership Academy is one of the top schools in Northern Uganda for its academic performance and sports teams. Soon after opening, Love Does added more grade levels so that the levels spanned from Senior One to Senior Six, which is the U.S. equivalent of junior high and high school. They added dorms so that the children could live at the school and they also introduced a program of family cells, so that the students could thrive in a safe, caring and family-like environment with assigned mentors. They kept the cost of tuition to less than half of the normal rate, and put many students on scholarship so that they could continue to attend. In 2011, they were able to build a school campus on land that they had purchased for their students. A couple of years later, in March 2013, they opened a primary school in order to provide more opportunities for education at all ages. In the summer of 2017, they began building a new primary school campus across the street from Restore Leadership Academy, so that the primary school can continue to grow! Also in 2017, they wired the school buildings with electricity so the campus always has power! In addition to academics, they have focused on a holistic approach to student development by providing extracurricular actives and community building programs such a sport teams, boy and girl scouts, group studies, and music programs. ===India=== India Restore International Throughout the world, 29 million people each year are enslaved. That is the highest number in the history of the world. India has been noted to have more than half of the world slave population. Love Does has been working in India since 2002 to investigate and perform surveillance to find children being enslaved in brothels or other forms of bonded labor. They work with police to do raids, rescue the children, and arrest the traffickers. The children are then taken to homes to be cared for and hopefully returned home to their families, depending on their situation. The perpetrators are prosecuted and hopefully prevented from enslaving more children. ===Somalia=== Somalia is a country torn by war and struggling to recover from years of famine, war, unrest, and violence. Unfortunately, the biggest victims are the women and children. It's estimated there are over a million displaced people in the country right now, and the vast majority of these people struggle to meet the basic needs of survival, let alone to pursue education and livelihoods. Love Does is working on improving educational opportunities for the youth, and safety and care for women and children. The Mogadishu Safe House was opened in September 2014 for women and children who had been victims of gender based violence. The home is a place for them to come for safety, medical attention, counseling and therapy, and then job training skills to help build their lives back. ===Iraq=== Love Does has been working in Iraq since the summer of 2014, when ISIS took control of vast areas of Northern Iraq and displaced almost a million people. During this time they have zeroed in on the refugee crisis, providing emergency supplies and aid, and then focusing their efforts on a school for refugee children. The Love Does School is now home to almost 300 refugees. The school is made up of Yazidi kids from Sinjar Mountain, Shabak kids from Mosul, and Arab kids from the Anbar province. All of their students are able to attend classes 5 days a week, and they bus all children living in IDP camps to the school. The Love Does Village is in progress and will consist of 20 homes for Syrian Refugee families. These families have been living in makeshift homes made up of tarps and shells of buildings. Love Does knows how important it is to have a safe place to live and grow families, and they are honored to be able to build them these homes. In the fall of 2017, they will begin building the Love Does Hospital to serve the refugee community. The hospital will be located within walking distance of the village and the school, and will be able to provide services to hundreds of refugees. ===Nepal=== Love Does wanted to open a home for young, orphaned girls to experience what it's like to be welcomed into a family and loved like one as well. In September 2014, they opened the Love Does Nepal Orphanage, which is now home to six incredible little girls. The girls are cared for by an amazing couple who live in the home. The girls all attend a private school nearby the home, so that they can receive an excellent education. In 2015 Love Does went on relief trips to Nepal after the earthquake that struck in April. After seeing the need there, they decided to open an after school program for kids whose homes were destroyed by the earthquake. It's called the Love Does School and they have more than 40 amazing kids attending. They come to the center after they get out of school and get a meal, tutoring, help with homework, and a safe place to spend time. == Child Sponsorship == Love Does pairs students with friends in the States or around the world who want to help out financially and be a friend to the kids for encouragement and support. Sponsorship enables Love Does to continue operating the schools in Uganda and Somalia by subsidizing the expenses each month, and it also allows them to provide scholarships, reduce tuition, and other benefits to the children. Love Does is dedicated to restore hope, invest in the future leaders, and change a few lives for the better. The cost of the sponsorship \\"engage\\" program is $1 USD per day which provides over 700 children with a home, meals, and an education. ==References== Category:Non-profit organizations based in the United States Category:Human rights organizations based in the United States Category:Organizations that combat human trafficking ","title":"Restore International"},{"id":"42012280","text":"Petiet may refer to: *Claude Louis Petiet (1749‚Äì1806), a French man, commissioner of war in 1778, elected to the elected to the Council of Elders in 1795, appointed Minister of War on 8 February 1796 and a Senator in 1806 *Paul Petiet (1770‚Äì1849), a French adjutant-general during the Napoleonic Wars *Auguste-Louis Petiet (1772‚Äì1858), a French brigadier general and a politician. *Jules Petiet (1813‚Äì1871), a French mechanical engineer who worked on the early development of the French railway ","title":"Petiet"},{"id":"42012294","text":"The 2014 Uzbekistan Cup was the 22nd season of the annual Uzbek football Cup competition.

It hosts the Grand Canyon Antelopes of the Western Athletic Conference. The field is named for Dr. Dave Brazell, considered to be \\"the founder and developer of Canyon baseball.\\" As the coach of the Lopes for 28 seasons, Brazell put together an impressive record of 728-385-8. The playing surface is composed complete of natural grass, save for infield foul territory where AstroTurf was installed in 2018. An inning-by-inning digital scoreboard is visible in left-center field. ==HistoryField established=== In 1962, the program's facility was relocated from a more centralized location on the campus to the west end with the left field fence running parallel to 35th Avenue. The layout of the field remains largely unchanged from its 1962 debut. In 1970, the field was named Brazell Field. ===Brazell Stadium era=== With the addition of bleacher seating, the facility transitioned from Brazell Field to Brazell Stadium in 1987. Gold-colored bleachers wrapped around the home plate area, extending to each team's dugouts on either side. The stadium featured lights, making night games possible. In the off-season prior to the 2014 baseball season, large shades were added over the stands. The official capacity for the venue was 1,500. Improvements over the years at Brazell Stadium included replacement of wood bleachers, backstop improvements and the awning. On February 21, 2014, the Grand Canyon Antelopes baseball team hosted the inaugural game in which the Lopes were a full member of the WAC Conference. The Lopes defeated the Hofstra Pride in convincing 8‚Äì1 fashion behind a complete game from starting pitcher Jorge Perez. After spending four seasons in Division I for baseball only from 1995‚Äì1998, the entire athletic department made the jump to NCAA Division I for the fall of 2013. Since the return to Division I for the baseball program, the Lopes boasted a 35‚Äì13 record at Brazell Stadium through the 2015 season. ===Birth of GCU Ballpark=== In August 2016, the university announced its 10-in-2 initiative to build 10 new athletic facilities in two years to coincide with the final stages of GCU's full Division I membership. Among these 10 facilities was a new baseball stadium, later named GCU Ballpark. The new name of the facility was announced as Brazell Field at GCU Ballpark on January 22, 2018. Demolition of the former stadium including the press box, grandstands, and dugouts began on May 22, 2017, following the conclusion of the home portion of the team's schedule. The new facility delivers several new amenities for the program: chairback seating for over 3,000 fans, a multi-room press box, an upgraded sound system, an entertainment patio in right field, berm seating for fans in right field, an on-site concession stand and a team store. ==See also== * List of NCAA Division I baseball venues ==References * GCU Baseball Website Category:Grand Canyon Antelopes baseball Category:College baseball venues in the United States Category:Baseball venues in Arizona Category:1962 establishments in Arizona Category:Sports venues completed in 1962 ","title":"Brazell Field at GCU Ballpark"},{"id":"42012375","text":"Tubney is a small village in Oxfordshire, England (in Berkshire until 1974).

The abbey retained the overlordship of the manor throughout the Middle Ages. In 1479, the manor was granted to William Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester, for the foundation of Magdalen College, his new college at Oxford. The college has retained the manor ever since. The medieval settlement was over a mile northeast of the modern village, near the village of Appleton. The medieval settlement was deserted by the 16th century. The site is marked by the remains of a medieval moat at Tubney Manor Farm. Nothing remains of the medieval church, although its graveyard could still be seen in the early 20th century. Although there was no parish church, the parish had a parson, to whom Magdalen College was paying a stipend of ¬£44 a year in the 17th century. In the 18th century it was reported that the incumbents were inducted under a hawthorn bush. The modern site of Tubney was settled from the 17th century. A new church, designed by A. W.

Constructed in 1907 by Youngferdorf & Son the building was the city hall for St. Johns, Oregon. When the town was annexed in 1915, the city hall was turned over to Portland officials who designated it the Portland Police Bureau's North Precinct until 2009. It now houses the Bureau's Traffic Division. ==HistoryCity of St. Johns (1905‚Äì1915)=== By 1905, the St. Johns City Council was planning to build a new city hall building. In January 1906, amid financial woes, the city was facing the prospect of selling of their land for which they intended to erect the new municipal building. The land was purchased by Charles Olhouse for $3,500 ($ adjusted for inflation). By January, with one month remaining on their payment deadline, the council had only put-up $200 ($ adjusted for inflation) total. M. L. Holbrook gave the town $2,000 ($ adjusted for inflation) and W. M. Killingsworth contributed $1,000 ($ adjusted for inflation) to the project with the promise that it would be returned in due time. One member of the city council who was adamant in his disapproval of the proposed city hall was Alderman S. C. Norton, who claimed the council was purposely misleading the public and acting against their will. Norton claimed that the proposed $10,000 ($ adjusted for inflation) to build a new city hall was a made-up figure. Ultimately a $7,953 ($ adjusted for inflation) contract was granted to Youngferdorf & Son, who would be responsible for the building's foundation, outside and inside walls, roof, gas piping, and flooring. The city hall contract was to be completed in just two months, November and December 1906. But Youngfedorf & Son failed to meet the deadline, causing the city to step in and take over the operation. The contractors were paid just $2,000 ($ adjusted for inflation), with $800 ($ adjusted for inflation) worth of work to still be done on the building. This alarmed Alderman S. C. Norton, who said there was a \\"conspiracy\\" between the contractors and Alderman, and hoped to get to the bottom of it. Norton sharply questioned City Recorder Thorndyke about the haste placed on the construction of the building. He and City Attorney Green, as well as councilmen W. H. King, felt that Norton was grasping at straws. The building's architect, W. W. Goodrich, explained in a letter to the council that the contract was not completed due to poor weather and failed shipments. Eventually, Goodrich won the favor of Mayor Hinman, who called for the contact be restored to Youngfedorf & Son. A week later the architect was dead. Goodrich's son took the project over. It was scheduled to be completed and ready for use by July 1, 1907. The two-story brick building on concrete foundation had offices for the mayor, city recorder, city attorney, chief of police and the fire department, as well as a gymnasium and a records room on the first floor. The second floor had the council's chambers which encompassed most of the floor. Smaller rooms were also on the second floor, to be used as committee and jury rooms. The basement featured jail cells. The city hall photographed from the St. Johns Bridge. After it was voted that St. Johns would be annexed into the City of Portland the mayor of St. Johns made his final order, that the prison's lone inmate be freed. The keys were turned over to Portland officials on July 8, 1915, along with $292.69 ($ adjusted for inflation) from the treasury. It was noted that there was a balance of $6019.10 ($ adjusted for inflation) on the books just a week prior, prompting Portland officials to launch an investigation. ===City of Portland (1915‚Äìpresent)=== After St. Johns was annexed in 1915, the City of Portland used the building to house members of Portland Fire & Rescue and the Portland Police Bureau. In 1954, a new fire station was built in St. Johns leaving the police as the lone tenant in the city hall. In 1976, the building was temporarily closed for improvements which was a part of an urban renewal plan spearheaded by mayor Neil Goldschmidt. In the late 1970s, the Portland Police Bureau allowed the St. John Booster Club to use the conference room. Plans to close the precinct were announced in 1994, but canceled at the urging of St. Johns residents and mayor Vera Katz. Budget cuts forecasted the need to close the building in 1997, but again mayor Katz led the effort to save the precinct which was ultimately successful. It was again defended by Katz during 2002 budget cuts. By 2007, the Portland Police Bureau lowest volume of calls came from the north precinct. In 2009, Portland Police Chief Rosie Sizer announced the consolidation of Portland's five police precincts into three, combining North and Northeast into one larger North Precinct which would be headquartered out of the former Northeast precinct building located at NE Emerson and MLK Jr. Blvd. The old North precinct building has since been home to PPB's Traffic Division. ==References== Category:Government buildings completed in 1907 Category:City halls in Oregon City Hall Category:Portland Police Bureau Category:Government buildings in Oregon Category:Defunct fire stations in Oregon Category:Jails in Oregon Category:Georgian architecture in Oregon Category:Portland Historic Landmarks ","title":"St. Johns City Hall"},{"id":"42012453","text":"Quakers is the debut studio album by Quakers, a hip hop supergroup consisting of producers Fuzzface (Geoff Barrow), 7-Stu-7, and Katalyst.

The heptagrams forming the tiling are of type {7/2}, 40px. The overlapping heptagrams subdivide the hyperbolic plane into isosceles triangles, 14 of which form each heptagram. Each point of the hyperbolic plane that does not lie on a heptagram edge belongs to the central heptagon of one heptagram, and is in one of the points of exactly one other heptagram. The winding number of each heptagram around its points is one, and the winding number around the central heptagon is two, so adding these two numbers together, each point of the plane is surrounded three times; that is, the density of the tiling is 3\\\\. In the Euclidean plane, a heptagram of type {7/2} would have angles of 3/7 at its vertices, but in the hyperbolic plane heptagrams can have the sharper vertex angle 2/7 that is needed to make exactly seven other heptagrams meet up at the center of each heptagram of the tiling. == Related tilings== It has the same vertex arrangement as the regular order-7 triangular tiling, {3,7}. The full set of edges coincide with the edges of a heptakis heptagonal tiling. The valance 6 vertices in this tiling are false-vertices in the heptagrammic one caused by crossed edges. :160px160px It is related to a Kepler-Poinsot polyhedron, the small stellated dodecahedron, {5/2,5}, which is polyhedron and a density-3 regular star-tiling on the sphere: :240px ==References== * John H.

Located in Bear Brook State Park, in Allenstown, the camp's facilities have been adaptively reused to provide space for park administration and a small museum. It is located in the northwestern portion of the park, south of Deerfield Road. It is also believed to be one of the few relatively intact CCC camps in the nation. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. ==Description and history== The United States Forest Service purchased the lands that make up much of Bear Brook State Park in 1935, as part of a jobs plan for acquiring and adapting lands of marginal agricultural value for recreational purposes. The 1123rd Company of the Civilian Conservation Corps was established in those lands in 1935 to undertake the process of building out infrastructure for recreation. The crew was housed in a camp that included thirteen structures, built out of relatively inexpensive materials in a rapid period of time, to standardized designs developed by the United States Army. The buildings were framed in southern pine, with walls and roofs of pine wallboard covered in tarpaper. They were built without foundations, the sills set directly on the ground, as they were intended to be temporary structures. The camp at Bear Brook operated from 1935 until 1942, when the CCC program was terminated. It was used for one year as a recreational facility for United States Navy personnel on leave from ships docked in nearby coastal harbors, and was then turned over to the state. The camp complex was adapted for use as a maintenance and residence facility for park staff. Buildings were given more durable exteriors (now generally asphalt shingle roofing and wooden shingle siding), and their interiors were altered for these new uses. Of the roughly fifteen buildings erected in the camp, eight survive, as do many of the trees planted in the campground by the CCC, which have matured and provide shade to the area. One of the buildings now houses a small museum devoted to local CCC history. The camp is the only one to survive in any significant form in the state (out of 26 built), and is one of a small number in the nation to retain as many buildings as it has. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Merrimack County, New Hampshire *New Hampshire Historical Marker No. 205: Bear Brook CCC Camp 1935‚Äì1942 ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Merrimack County, New Hampshire Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:Civilian Conservation Corps in New Hampshire Category:Allenstown, New Hampshire ","title":"Bear Brook State Park Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Camp Historic District"},{"id":"42012994","text":"Delta (also called \\"Delta\\" in the original language) is a 2008 Hungarian drama film directed by Korn√©l Mundrucz√≥ and starring violinist F√©lix Lajk√≥ in a non- musical acting role and actress Orsi T√≥th.The Hollywood Reporter - Volumes 404-405 2008 - Page 105 DELTA (Hungary, Germany: drama) Director: Kornel Mundruczo; cast: Orsi Toth.

After attending the public school in Andover, Frye was apprenticed as a machinist in Davis & Furber's machine shops in North Andover, where he worked until he joined Eddy. He moved with his family to Lawrence in the early 1860s. When he was 26 years old, Calvin married Ada E. Brush of Lowell, who was visiting in Lawrence, and who attended the same church. She died one year after the marriage, and Frye moved back in with his family. Calvin and his widowed sister, Lydia Roaf, first became interested in Christian Science through a sister-in-law, Mrs. Oscar Frye. Calvin took a course of instruction under Eddy, after which he, as well as his sister, became practitioners in Lawrence, although he would only be there about a year. Calvin joined Eddy in Boston in 1882, shortly after the death of her husband Asa Eddy. Lydia followed Calvin, and for some time did Eddy's housework. Lydia later returned to Lawrence. Frye lived in Eddy's homes at 569 Columbus Avenue, Boston, and later at Pleasant View, Concord, New Hampshire, and Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. He worked as Eddy's secretary, managing her personal affairs, and dealing with her official correspondence.Gillian Gill, Mary Baker Eddy, De Capo Press, 1998, 396, 400. He was reportedly with her practically every day from August 1882, when he joined her household as her chief aide, until she died in December 1910.Robert Peel, Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Trial, Christian Science Publishing Society, 1971, 136, cited in Caroline Fraser, God's Perfect Child, Metropolitan Books, 1999, p. 83; according to Gill, xxxii, 399‚Äì400, Frye spent four nights apart from Eddy. Frye became known locally during his lifetime for taking Eddy for a daily ride in a horse-drawn carriage, with Frye dressed in a uniform and top hat sitting next to the coachman.Gill, 393. Among critics of the church he is known chiefly for the diary he left behind, which details Eddy's domestic life. Caroline Fraser, the most famous modern critic, called his notebooks \\"mysterious\\" in 1999, and claimed that at the time of writing, no outside scholars had been allowed to see the originals.Fraser, 84. In the hours following Frye's death, John V. Dittemore, a former member of the church's Board of Directors who had become estranged from them, entered Frye's house and removed sections from Frye's diary which he considered most incriminating, he then transcribed, photographed, and burned the originals.Gill, 576 He later used the copies to write a critical biography of Eddy with Ernest Sutherland Bates in 1932. Frye is buried in the West Parish Garden Cemetery in Andover, Massachusetts (Plot 02-123f). ==Notes Category:1845 births Category:1917 deaths Category:Christian Science Category:American Christian Scientists Category:Converts to Christian Science ","title":"Calvin Frye"},{"id":"42013168","text":"is a Japanese comedy manga series written and illustrated by Masahiro Hirakata. It was serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from November 2012 to May 2013. Shueisha compiled its 24 individual chapters into three tank≈çbon volumes. The series focuses on the comedic adventures of Kiruko Otonashi and Haruki Anj≈ç, two rookie policemen in the k≈çban of the small rural town of , and their chief, Kanj≈´r≈ç Tsutsui. ==Plot== Haruki Anj≈ç is a police officer eagerly anticipating the arrival of his first junior in the rural and uneventful town of where he works. However, he certainly didn't expect the rookie to be ex-mercenary Kiruko Otonashi, a green-haired young woman without any common sense who has the unfortunate habit of hilariously failing every single task she tries, often causing more harm than good. And thus, Haruki must take the responsibility of teaching Kiruko the ways on how to be a proper policewoman, while covering up and fixing all the trouble she stirs. ==Characters== ; :The main and title character of the series. A former mercenary with considerable experience on the battlefield, she later became a policewoman and got assigned to the Nagashima police station (which officers not wanted by other stations are often sent). Kiruko is depicted as an average-sized young woman who is distinct for having bright green hair and orange eyes (one covered by an eyepatch). Kiruko is considered attractive by many of the other characters, and is also noted for her large bust size, which her colleagues (especially Haruki) often bring up or reference to during everyday conversation. She is energetic and enthusiastic about her new job in the police, though often gets carried away, and ends up doing more harm than good. :Due to her extensive training in the military, Kiruko often fails to apply common sense and greatly overreacts to everyday scenarios, or applies military strategies (such as proposing to clear a road with grenades before crossing). Though wanting to do good, Kiruko is oftentimes inexperienced and escalates or overreacts to normal issues (much to the annoyance of Haruki). Kiruko wields two Tonfa Blades, which she carries with her all the time, and is capable of inflicting great damage with them (despite being repeatedly warned by Haruki not to).

Depicted an ordinary in most ways, with reddish-brown hair and yellow eyes, Haruki is sometimes lazy and tries to avoid doing work when on duty. He is the colleague and mentor of Kiruko, being with her most of the time while carrying out their duties and policemen, and as a result, is responsible for her mistakes and accidents (a running gag being that he gets punished whenever Kiruko screws up, often in form of getting his pay deducted). :Unlike Kiruko, Haruki has much more experience in the police force, and is also much calmer (though panics when his plans fail). He confesses himself to be very perverted, often wanting to touch Kiruko's breasts, and would (inadvertently) tell his desires to other characters. Despite his numerous shortcomings, however, Haruki is shown to be generally helpful and competent, often trying his best at helping Kiruko on the job (though he may only being doing this to avoid further pay deductions) or taking the initiative to support others. ; :The chief of Nagashima station.

The area has been farmed since the 1730s, when Henniker was laid out, and has been in the Bennett family for over a century. It is the oldest surviving farmstead in the rural community, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. ==Description and history== The Bennett Farm consists of of land in eastern Henniker, roughly bounded by Elm Street, Bennett Road (aka Old Route 114), and New Hampshire Route 114. A narrow strip of cleared farmland lies north of Bennett Road, as does the main house. Additional cleared land is southwest of the Bennett Road/Elm Street junction, with the balance of the land wooded. The farmstead includes a number of buildings, the oldest of which is the c. 1780 main house. This building, a five-bay two-story wood frame with a large central chimney, was used as a tavern until the mid-19th century, when the property was converted to exclusively agricultural uses. The most unusual building on the property is the barn, which was originally built in 1834 as a religious meeting house, was moved to its present location in 1860 and then converted for use as a barn. Its steeple was blown off in 1937, leaving a cupola-like top. The land making up the farm was first granted to John Clark in 1733. This property was purchased in 1779 by John Goodenow, who established a tavern the following year, and is the likely builder of the house. The property continued in use as a tavern until 1848, after which it was used exclusively for agricultural purposes. It has been owned since 1902 by the Bennett family, which originally had a diversified farm operation, including the raising of poultry and dairy cattle. In recent years the land has been farmed by neighbors. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Merrimack County, New Hampshire ==References== Category:Farms on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:Houses in Merrimack County, New Hampshire Category:Farms in New Hampshire Category:National Register of Historic Places in Merrimack County, New Hampshire Category:Henniker, New Hampshire ","title":"Bennett Farm (Henniker, New Hampshire)"},{"id":"42013252","text":"Candelario Garcia, Jr. (February 26, 1944 - January 10, 2013) was a United States Army veteran of the Vietnam War, and a recipient of the Medal of Honor. \\"Biography\\" or \\"Citation\\" tabs. ==Biography== Garcia was born in Corsicana, Texas, Feb. 26, 1944, and was of Mexican American descent.http://www.dallasnews.com/news/news/2015/09/16/latino-cultural-center- pays-homage-to-mexican-american-veterans He enlisted in the U.S. Army on May 28, 1963, and his actions on December 8, 1968 while serving in Vietnam caused him to receive the Medal of Honor, posthumously, in 2014.

It was built in the fourteenth century as a Franciscan abbey church and has been a listed monument since 1973. == History and architecture == Decorated gable View of the choir View of the organ On the site of the modern church in the eastern part of the old city, in Schnoor, the Franciscans erected a monastery with a basilica in 1225. The monastery grew rapidly and the church was soon too small. As a result, a vaulted Hall church with three aisles was built in its place in 1380. The money for this came mostly from the many funerary endowments resulting from the Black Death in Europe, which killed seven thousand in Bremen.Faltblatt der Katholischen Propsteigemeine St. Johann, Bremen o.J. In 1528, during the Reformation, the monastery was closed and Bremen's first hospital and mental asylum was built on the site of the monastery in 1538, with the approval of the monks. Church and monastery served different purposes; the church was used as a hospital church and sometimes served Protestant congregations when their churches were being renovated or repaired. From 1684 religious services of the Hugenots and later of Belgian religious refugees were held in the church. Until the middle of the seventeenth century, the monastery continued to serve as Bremen's hospital. At that point it became a retirement home, in which the possessors of prebends lived - citizens who had secured a permanent right of residence for themselves in exchange for a payment of a sum. From 1802 only the choir was used in religious services. The nave was meant to be converted into a warehouse, but, due to the Napoleonic invasion of Bremen, this never occurred. The catholic community which was officially recognised again in 1806 acquired the church at the impetus of the council and rededicated it as a Catholic church on 17 October 1823, after restoration work. Using the rubble from the destruction of the monastery for hygiene reasons in 1834, the level of the streets around the church was raised by two meters to avoid floods; within the church, the floor level was raised by three metres. As a result, a large cellar was created, which was rented commercially in order to offset debt until 1992 when it became the crypt. Raising the floor level of the church meant that the ceiling height is three metres lower than it used to be. The reconstruction of 1822/3 can be most easily be discerned from the lower part of the choir windows which have been bricked up. St John is the only surviving monastery church in the city. Only Catherine's Passage (Katharinenpassage) in the city centre testifies to the existence of the earlier Dominican monastery and its church of St Katherine. St Paul's monastery in front of the city gates was destroyed in 1546 by military action. The church building is a particularly clear example of the Brick gothic style. All three naves were covered by a single especially large pitched roof. The west gable's extraordinary form and size derives from this design. It is divided into three stories, which each contain pointed arch windows arranged in pairs. The base line of these windows is a line of ornamental brickwork. At the apex of the gable is a cruciform window with a star of David. This has been in place since 1878, when the roof was repaired and the new gable installed, surmounted by a stone cross. The star of David was probably included as a result of horror vacui. No other symbolic significance at all is attested in church documents. One can, however, suggest that the star of David is symbolic of the Old Testament and the cruciform shape is symbolic of the New Testament. The two belong together and form the foundation of the church. The building did not include a tower originally, in line with the rules of the Franciscan order, though it did have a Fl√®che. === St John's Abbey === The former St John's Abbey of the Franciscan order, which stood next to the church, no longer survives. It existed from 1258 to 1528. === Provost of St John === In 1965 a series of two story red stone houses, designed by Bernhard Wessel for the Provost of St John (Propstei St. Johannis), were built at Hohe Stra√üe 2-7/Franziskanerstra√üe 7 on the monastery grounds. Since 1973 the buildings are among Bremen's listed heritage sites. == Community == The parish of St John and the parish of St Elisabeth in Hastedt (Bremen) were combined as the provostship of St John on 1 January 2007. 10,500 Catholics from more than a hundred nations belong to the new congregation. The provostship has its office at Hohe Stra√üe 2-7. St John's kindergarten (Kolpingstra√üe 2), St John's elementary school (Tiefer 12), St John's secondary school I and II (Dechanatstra√üe 9) and Birgittenkloster (Convent of Saint Birgitta) are a few of many provostship buildings in the municipal area. Dr Hermann Lange was chaplain and pastor of the church from 1911 to 1931. == Organ == The organ of St John's was built in 1965 by the organ firm Franz Breil (Dorsten). The instrument has 47 registers in three manuals. The playing system is mechanical, but the register system is electronic.More detailed information on the Organ of St John's == See also == *Roman Catholic Diocese of Osnabr√ºck == Bibliography == *Wilhelm Tacke.

Private First Class Leonard's platoon was reduced to eight men as a result of blistering artillery, mortar, machinegun, and rifle fire. Private First Class Leonard led the survivors in an assault over a hill covered by trees and shrubs which the enemy continuously swept with automatic weapons fire. Ignoring bullets which pierced his pack, Private First Class Leonard killed two snipers at ranges of fifty and seventy-five yards and engaged and destroyed a machinegun nest with grenades, killing its two-man crew. Though momentarily stunned by an exploding bazooka shell, Private First Class Leonard relentlessly advanced, ultimately knocking out a second machinegun nest and capturing the roadblock objective.

In the 1930 census, Alfred and his brothers are in a foster home in Harrison, New York. By 1940, Alfred had left high school after two years and had been working as a machinist in Nassau County, Long Island. On October 5, 1940, he enlisted in the United States Army in Jamaica, Queens, New York.WWII Army Enlistment Records It is not clearly known if Nietzel immediately joined the Army's 16th Infantry Regiment then posted in New York City at Fort Jay on Governors Island, or if he served in other units prior to November 1944. By late November 1944, Nietzel was a sergeant in Company H, 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, as U.S. First Army's move across France, Belgium and Germany had been in heavy, grueling, combat for nearly seven straight weeks since September. Alfred died in combat during the Battle of H√ºrtgen Forest, along the Belgium-German border on November 18, 1944. The H√ºrtgen Forest was hard-fought and the longest battle ever waged by the U.S. Army. The battle's heavy losses and questionable objectives were soon overshadowed by the desperate circumstances of the Battle of the Bulge a month later, leaving the H√ºrtgen Forest offensive largely forgotten. In an intense day of fighting for a hill and the town of Heistern, Germany, several 16th Infantry soldiers were awarded the Silver Star and Distinguished Service Cross. Nietzel's original 1945 Distinguished Service Cross citation noted that he selflessly covered for the retreating members of his squad which he had sent to the rear for reinforcements. He did so by laying down suppressive fire with his .30 caliber machine-gun on an enemy advance threatening to overrun his position. He continued until all his ammunition was expended then picked up his rifle and continued firing until killed by an enemy grenade. His actions delayed the advance of the opposing force long enough for reinforcements to arrive, stop and turn back the enemy.https://www.facebook.com/govislandnps/photos/pb.316922631589.-2207520000.1414636742./10152252982946590/?type=3&theater; Accessed 29 October 2014 The 2014 Medal of Honor citation further observed: \\"That afternoon, Sergeant Nietzel fought tenaciously to repel a vicious enemy attack against his unit. Sergeant Nietzel employed accurate, intense fire from his machine gun and successfully slowed the hostile advance. However, the overwhelming enemy force continued to press forward. Realizing he desperately needed reinforcements, Sergeant Nietzel ordered the three remaining members of his squad to return to the company command post and secure aid. He immediately turned his attention to covering their movement with his fire. After expending all his machine gun ammunition, Sergeant Nietzel began firing his rifle into the attacking ranks until he was killed by the explosion of an enemy grenade.\\" After his death, he was temporarily interred at the Henri-Chapelle American Cemetery and Memorial in Belgium and repatriated to the United States in 1949. On April 19, 1949, a week before what would have been his 28th birthday, Nietzel was laid to rest at the Long Island National Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York. On the same day and in the adjoining gravesite, his younger brother William Nietzel, a private in the Army Air Corps was also buried.

Schwab was among five additional service members who the review identified as having been overlooked for the honor. Schwab's son, Dr. Terry Schwab, accepted the Medal of Honor on behalf of his late father during a White House ceremony in 2014. ==See also== *List of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II ==References Category:1918 births Category:2005 deaths Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:People from Hooper, Nebraska Category:United States Army Medal of Honor recipients Category:United States Army officers Category:World War II recipients of the Medal of Honor ","title":"Donald K.

The common name alludes to the species‚Äô breeding range and migration pattern, which is similar to the historic Rota dos Tropeiros, the drovers' road used to drive livestock to markets in south-eastern Brazil from the early 18th century to 1930. ==Description== The adult male is distinguished from the plumbeous seedeater by its larger size and bluish (rather than plumbeous) grey plumage, and from that and other Sporophila seedeaters, by having a robust, bright yellow beak with an arched culmen, and by vocalisations that include unique call notes. ==Distribution and habitat== Tropeiro seedeaters breed in upland shrubby grasslands associated with the Araucaria forests of southern Brazil. They migrate northwards to spend the austral winter ‚Äì the non-breeding season ‚Äì in the Cerrado savannas of central Brazil. The range contains a narrow contact zone between the Tropeiro and plumbeous seedeaters, where the birds are segregated by habitat that contains little significant gene flow. == See also == * Tropeiro ==References== Category:Sporophila seedeater seedeater Category:Birds described in 2013 ","title":"Tropeiro seedeater"},{"id":"42013510","text":"Sara Errani was the two-time defending champion, but chose not to participate.

The 27,500 ft. prefabricated building cost US$648,000 (US$ adjusted for inflation) was designed by Richard L. Glassford and Associations and manufactured in the Midwest United States. The total construction cost reached US$883,537 (US$ adjusted for inflation), most of which came from Economic Development Administration, when the building was erected. A failed plan in 1981 called for part of the racquet center be made a roller rink. In October 1981, a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) round robin tournament was held at the racquet center. The maximum capacity of the building in accordance to the fire code is 20 people. Threats to close the center came in 1983 from Portland Parks & Recreation commissioner Charles Jordan. Instead the hours of operations were cut. A racquetball club known as the \\"Smashers\\" was organized at the center in 1984. The center held a table tennis tournament in 1987 and 1988. Plans to allow an private company operate the center were drawn up in 1994 but were quickly abandoned. A similar plan came up in 2006 and also failed. A plan to tear the center down to construct an apartment building was proposed in 2007 but was shelved and it was never recommended again. The center hosts several Portland Interscholastic League tennis matches. It is currently operated by Portland After-School Tennis & Education (PASTE). ==See also== * List of sports venues in Portland, Oregon ==References * St Johns Racquet Center ‚Äî PortlandOregon.gov * Portland After-School Tennis & Education (PASTE) ‚Äî St. Johns * St Johns Racquet Club ‚Äî TennisPoint.com Category:1979 establishments in Oregon Category:Sports venues completed in 1979 Category:Sports venues in Portland, Oregon Category:Tennis venues in the United States Category:Racquetball in the United States Category:Parks in Portland, Oregon Category:Buildings and structures in St. Johns, Portland, Oregon Category:Prefabricated buildings ","title":"St. Johns Racquet Center"},{"id":"42013607","text":"Lida Martinoli Lida Martinoli (1914‚Äì1991) was an Argentine dancer, choreographer, and theatre performer in Buenos Aires. Born in Rosario, Santa Fe in 1914, she was the daughter of the artists Fanny Montiano and Carlos Martinoli. She studied ballet at La Scala in Milan before returning to Buenos Aires in 1932. She joined the corps de ballet of the Teatro Col√≥n, where she danced until 1956. At the Teatro Col√≥n, she served as prima ballerina during the 1940s, dancing the choreographies of Vaslav Nijinsky and Margarita Wallmann and starring in her version of The Nutcracker with Michael Borovski and Maria Ruvanova. In 1953, as prima ballerina for Teatro Col√≥n, she performed at Carnegie Hall in her North American debut. When she retired from dancing, Martinoli began to choreograph, and is known for her kitschy and outlandish dances - the chorography for \\"La Leprosa\\" required the actor to stick ham to themselves that fell off during the dance, imitating the symptoms of leprosy. She died in Santa Fe in 1991. Screenwriters Kado Kostzer and Afredo Rodriguez Arias wrote the play \\"Familie d'Artistes\\" about Lida and the Martinoli family in 1989, which was staged at the Teatro Maipo in Buenos Aires in 1991. ==References== Category:1914 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Argentine female dancers Category:Argentine choreographers Category:People from Rosario, Santa Fe ","title":"Lida Martinoli"},{"id":"42013669","text":"Dale Church () is a parish church in Luster Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. It is located in the village of Luster on the western shore of the Lustrafjorden. It is the church for the Dale parish which is part of the Sogn prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The red and white, stone church was built in a long church design around the year 1240 using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 200 people. ==History== The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1306, but it was likely built about 60 years earlier. Dale Church in Luster reflects both Romanesque and Gothic styles. The medieval-era church was dedicated to Saint Nicholas. The church is endowed with soapstone sculptures and preserved interiors from the Middle Ages. Construction includes granite in cavity walls with soapstone corners and frames. The nave and choir are rectangular. The porch and the ridge turret above the entrance in the west were built in the 1600s. The Gothic west portal dates to 1250. Werner Olsen added a tower in 1635; that tower has not been preserved, and the current tower was added later. The church was restored in 1903 under the direction of architect Jens Zetlitz Monrad Kielland. Furnishings for Dale Church are from various eras. The baptismal font from the 1200s is of soapstone and is shaped as a four-leaf clover. The pulpit is in Renaissance style from the 1600s, while the baroque altarpiece and memory boards are from around 1700. The pulpit has pictures of evangelists in the side panels together with depictions of the Crucifixion with Mary and John the Evangelist at foot of the cross, flanked by Moses and John the Baptist. The choir wall is decorated with frescoes from the late 1500s. The bride bench dates from the 1100s and the crucifix from the 1200s. ==Media gallery== Dale kyrkje i Luster 1.jpgExterior view of the church Dale kyrkje i Luster.jpgSide view of the church Dale kyrkje Luster prestebustad.JPG Church with parsonage Dale kirke.jpgSoapstone carved art work Dale kirke i Luster, 2016.jpgChurch and churchyard Dale kyrkje Luster kor alter.JPGInterior view of the church Dale kyrkje Luster klebersteinsportal.JPGSoapstone portal in the church Dale kyrkje Luster v√•penhus.JPGRosemaling inside church porch ==See also== *List of churches in Bj√∏rgvin ==References== Category:Luster, Norway Category:Churches in Vestland Category:Stone churches in Norway Category:13th-century Church of Norway church buildings Category:13th-century establishments in Norway ","title":"Dale Church (Luster)"},{"id":"42013674","text":"In geometry, the heptagrammic-order heptagonal tiling is a regular star-tiling of the hyperbolic plane.

It is located in the village of Fet in the Indre Hafslo area. It is one of the churches for the Fet og Joranger parish which is part of the Sogn prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1894 by the master builder John Alver using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 220 people. The church was consecrated on 12 November 1894 by Bishop Frederick Waldemar Hvoslef. From the hill where Fet Church is located, it is not long way away to the neighboring Joranger Church. Historians have often wondered why these two churches were built in the Middle Ages so close together. Jon Laberg, the author of the old local history book for Hafslo discussed the reason that Fet and Joranger each have their own churches, even though these farms lie near to each other. Laberg thinks that the owners of these farms could not reach agreement on a common church, so they each built their own church. Today, these two churches belong to the same parish. ==History== The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1340, but the church was built before that time. Around 1650, the old stave church was torn down and replaced with a new church on the same site. The new church was a timber-framed church. In 1894, the old church was torn down and a new church was constructed about west to a more stable building site. During the 1960s, there were some renovations. Heating work was improved so the church wasn't as cold and drafty, new flooring was installed, and a new roof was installed. About 20 years later in the 1980s, the church was enlarged to make room for a bathroom and sacristy on the northeast side of the building. ==See also== *List of churches in Bj√∏rgvin ==References== Category:Luster, Norway Category:Churches in Vestland Category:Wooden churches in Norway Category:19th-century Church of Norway church buildings Category:Churches completed in 1894 Category:1894 establishments in Norway ","title":"Fet Church (Luster)"},{"id":"42013719","text":"Paul H. Zukerberg (born November 20, 1957) is an American activist, lawyer, and politician. Through a series of lawsuits and appeals, Zukerberg successfully ensured the direct election of the Attorney General of the District of Columbia in 2014 after the Council of the District of Columbia and incumbent Irv Nathan sought to postpone the vote. == Career == Zukerberg is the son of a self-taught musician who played bar mitzvahs and weddings from Paterson, New Jersey. He graduated from Hamilton College, moved to Washington, DC to attend law school at American University, and received his JD in 1985. He became a criminal defense lawyer because he likes going to trial and he \\"just can't stand when someone gets the raw end of the deal.\\" He currently lives in Adams Morgan with two children and is a founding parent of the EL Haynes Public Charter School. In 2016, Zukerberg founded Zukerberg & Halperin, a personal injury law firm with offices in Washington, DC and Richmond, Virginia.http://www.zukerberghalperin.com ==Campaign for DC Council== In April 2012, Zukerberg declared his candidacy for a special election to the at-large seat on the DC Council with a pro-marijuana platform. According to Zukerberg, in 2011, DC was first in pot arrests with a record number that year. His council candidacy raised awareness of the importance of marijuana decriminalization in Washington, DC. One of Zukerberg's opponents, Elissa Silverman, unsuccessfully sought to have him disqualified by challenging the validity of his signatures. Zukerberg launched and paid for an outside firm to investigate the list of DC registered voters. Zukerberg said he discovered that the District of Columbia Board of Elections has not been properly updating its rolls, including failing to process 66,000 change-of-address forms. In the special election, held on April 23, 2013, Zukerberg came fifth out of eight candidates, receiving 1,195 votes (2.09%). ==Fight for an Elected Attorney General== In 2010, 90,316 District residents voted \\"overwhelmingly\\" to put D.C.'s first elected attorney general on the ballot in 2014. In July 2012, the DC council voted to postpone the election of attorney general to 2018. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson called the vote \\"an embarrassment.\\" In September 2013, Zukerberg filed suit against the DC Council and the city elections claiming any delay would violate the District charter ‚Äî which was amended through the 2010 ballot question to provide for the Attorney General election. Attorney General Irvin B. Nathan initially argued that Zukerberg was not suffering any \\"meaningful hardship\\" from pushing back the election. In November 2013, Zukerberg announced his candidacy for Attorney General and argued that he would suffer irreparable harm if it did not occur. On February 7, 2014, a District of Columbia judge ruled that ballots for the April 1 primary could be printed without the Attorney General race. Zukerberg appealed the ruling. On June 4, 2014 the Court of Appeals overturned the lower court's decision. According to the ruling, the Court of Appeals \\"[determined] that the Superior Court's interpretation was incorrect as a matter of law and reverse.\\" They stated in the ruling that original language in Elected Attorney General Act is ambiguous in stating the election \\"shall be after January 1, 2014,\\" and that the attorney general referendum that was ratified by a majority of D.C. voters last year made it seem as though the election would take place in 2014. On June 13, Zukerberg collected nominating petitions. == Campaign for Attorney General == Zukerberg has said he would better represent the public interest than previous Attorneys General, support decriminalization of marijuana, and increase the ease with which nonviolent criminal records are expunged to promote restorative justice. He was endorsed by the Washington Teachers' Union, D.C. Councilmember Tommy Wells, the operator of D.C. Urban Moms & Dads, and the Washington City Paper. According to a September 2014 Washington Post poll, Zukerberg led the field of Attorney General candidates, with a 7 to 9 point advantage over each of his four competitors, Lorie Masters, Edward \\"Smitty\\" Smith, Karl Racine, and Lateefah Williams. However, the poll also found that 57% of the electorate was undecided. Zukerberg finished fourth behind Karl Racine, who won with 37% of the vote. ==References * Paul Zukerberg for DC Attorney General campaign website * Zukerberg Halperin website Category:1957 births Category:Jewish American attorneys Category:Living people Category:Washington University School of Law alumni Category:American lawyers Category:People from Adams Morgan Category:Hamilton College (New York) alumni ","title":"Paul Zukerberg"},{"id":"42013728","text":"Attack Squadron 212 (VA-212), nicknamed the Rampant Raiders, was an aviation unit of the United States Navy.

Pronouns are also particularly included in reverential capitalization: In this example, \\"God\\" is in capitals because it is, like \\"Day\\" or \\"Night\\", a noun that is here a proper name, whereas \\"He\\" is an example of reverential capitalization, since while proper names are capitalized universally, reverence for any particular divinity (belief is therein implied on the part of the author who capitalizes pronouns in reference to such being) is not universal. In short, when pronouns that are usually lowercase are capitalized, this usually implies that the author personally reveres and regards as a deity the antecedent of that pronoun. Nouns that are not proper names can also be capitalized out of reverence to the entity they refer to. Such examples include \\"the Lord\\", \\"the Father\\" and \\"the Creator\\". ==Capitalizing nouns== Capitalization, punctuation and spelling were not well standardized in early Modern English; for example, the 1611 King James Bible did not capitalize pronouns: In the 17th and 18th centuries, it became common to capitalize all nouns, as is still done in some other Germanic languages, including German. In languages that capitalize all nouns, reverential capitalization of the first two letters or the whole word can sometimes be seen. The following is an example in Danish, which capitalized nouns until 1948.Retskrivningsreformen af den 22. marts 1948 Note that some instances are in all caps (' \\"GOD\\"), and some begin with two capital letters (' \\"LOrd\\", ' \\"JEsus\\"). Some words that could also be said to refer to an almighty being begin with a single capital (' \\"Creator\\", ' \\"Christ\\", ' \\"the Father\\"), but so do all other nouns (' \\"Things\\"). This type of reverential capitalization varies within a single sentence and would also be dependent on the author and the publisher of a work. The convention of capitalizing nouns was eventually abandoned in English, and one of the people who was influential in this was Benjamin Blayney, who produced a 1769 edition of the Bible in which nouns were not capitalized‚Äîpossibly simply to save space on the printed page.Gordon Campbell, Bible: The Story of the King James Version 1611‚Äì2011 ==Capitalizing pronouns== In the 19th century, it became common to capitalize pronouns referring to the God of the Abrahamic religions, in order to show respect: An interesting early case is Handel's 1741 oratorio Messiah, whose printed libretto and published score both use lower case pronouns, but whose holograph conductor's score consistently capitalizes: In the 20th century this practice became far less common: Today there is no widely accepted rule in English on whether or not to use reverential capitalization. Different house styles have different rules given by their style manuals. Reverential capitalization is not to be used, for example, according to the style guidelines set by the Chicago Manual of StyleThe Chicago Manual of Style, 15e, University of Chicago Press, 2003 or the Associated Press Stylebook. It is prescribed, for example, by the US Government Printing Office Style Manual (2008). This capitalization rule is also customarily applied in Tagalog and other languages of the Philippines, despite being considered nonstandard and inconsistent by purists who contend that this rule is applied only in English. ==References== Category:Orthography Category:Syntax ","title":"Reverential capitalization"},{"id":"42013766","text":"Gibraltar Constitution Order may refer to: *Gibraltar Constitution Order 1969 *Gibraltar Constitution Order 2006 ","title":"Gibraltar Constitution Order"},{"id":"42013777","text":"Fortun Church () is a parish church in Luster Municipality in Vestland county, Norway.

The church seats about 250 people. ==History== The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1330, but it was not new that year; it was likely built sometime between 1160 and 1180. The original building was a stave church with a rectangular nave measuring and a slightly narrower wide choir. The original church stood about northeast of the present location of the church. In 1666, the choir was torn down and replaced with a larger one, the same width as the nave. Over time, the church became too small for the congregation and it was decided to replace it. A new church was built about southwest of the old church, a little closer to the river. The new church was completed and consecrated in 1879. After its completion, the decision was made to tear down the old church, but there was some controversy about this decision. Eventually, it was torn down, but the consul Fredrik Georg Gade bought most of the building materials and moved them to Fantoft in Bergen in 1883. There, Gade rebuilt the church and named Fantoft Stave Church. It was used as a museum and cultural site for over a century. On 6 June 1992, the centuries-old church was destroyed in an arson fire. Soon after, in 1997, a replica building was completed on the same site, but virtually all of the old parts from the original stave church in Fortun had been lost. ==Media gallery== File:Church of Fortun - Picture 1.jpgExterior view File:Fortun Lindahl.jpegView of the church in the late 19th century File:Fortun old.jpgView of the old stave church before it was moved to Bergen ==See also== *List of churches in Bj√∏rgvin ==References== Category:Luster, Norway Category:Churches in Vestland Category:Wooden churches in Norway Category:19th-century Church of Norway church buildings Category:Churches completed in 1879 Category:13th-century establishments in Norway ","title":"Fortun Church"},{"id":"42013793","text":"Eugene Leid Shirk (April 14, 1901 ‚Äì February 17, 1994) was an American politician who served as the Mayor of Reading, Pennsylvania for two terms as a Republican .

See Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 69 [935]. was an official of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period state Later Shu, serving as a chancellor during the reign of its second emperor Meng Chang. == Background == Not much is known about Wu Zhaoyi's personal background, including when he was born, but it is known that he was from Longmen (ÈæçÈñÄ, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). It was said that he was renowned in his knowledge and talent.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 52. When the Later Tang general Meng Zhixiang was commissioned by Later Tang's first emperor Li Cunxu as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) in late 925 in light of Later Tang's recent conquest of its southwestern neighbor Former Shu (which had ruled the territory),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. Meng invited Wu to serve as his secretary. After Li Cunxu was killed in a mutiny in 926 and succeeded by his adoptive brother Li Siyuan, Li Siyuan tried to assert more control over Meng by sending the official Li Yan (ÊùéÂö¥) to serve as the monitor of the Xichuan army later in the year,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Wu suggested Meng to deny Li Yan entry, but Meng did not agree. He ultimately allowed Li Yan to come to Xichuan's capital Chengdu, and then found an excuse to kill Li Yan. Despite his not having agreed with Wu, however, Meng saw Wu's point and believed him to be talented, and therefore wanted to find greater responsibilities for him. == As Later Shu official == After Meng Zhixiang declared himself the emperor of a new independent state of Later Shu in 934,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. he commissioned Wu Zhaoyi as the deputy chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û, Yushi Zhongcheng). Meng died later in 934, and was succeeded by his son Meng Chang. In 935, Wu was given the titles of Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé, deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng)) and Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. He was later made Menxia Shilang (ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰æçÈÉé, the deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng)). In 940, when fellow chancellor Zhao Jiliang, who had been overseeing the three financial agencies (taxation, treasury, and salt and iron monopolies), asked to have that responsibility divided between him, Wu, and fellow chancellor Zhang Ye, Meng Chang put Wu in charge of salt and iron monopolies and Zhang in charge of treasury, leaving Zhao in charge of taxation.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. In 948, two generals of Later Han (which was ruling the former Later Tang territory by this point), Wang Jingchong the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), and Zhao Siwan, who then controlled Yongxing Circuit (Ê∞∏Ëàà, headquartered in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi), rebelled against Later Han and entered an alliance with another rebel general, Li Shouzhen. However, they also sent emissaries to Later Shu, offering to submit to Meng Chang. Meng sent An Siqian (ÂÆâÊÄùË¨ô) the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) to aid them. Wu submitted a petition urging against it, pointing out the examples of Li Cunxu and Former Shu's last emperor Wang Zongyan as those who overly exerted their armies. Meng did not listen to him. Ultimately, the campaign was not successful, and Later Shu was unable to add those circuits to its possessions.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 288. Several years later, Wu retired with the honorific title Taizi Taishi (Â§™Â≠êÂ§™Â∏´). It was said that Wu was an ardent book collector and favored the study of old Confucian classic texts. He had the official Zhang Dezhao (ÂºµÂæ∑Èáó) copy the classics and carve them on stone tablets to be displayed at Chengdu, in the example of Tang Dynasty's display of such classics at its capital Chang'an. Further, it was said that the Shu region had lacked schools ever since Tang fell. Wu expended his private wealth to build schools and dormitories, and also persuaded Meng to have the Four Books and Five Classics reprinted. He also had his followers Gou Wenzheng (Âè•ÊñáÊ≠£) and Sun Jiangji (Â≠´Áµ≥Âêâ) reprint a number of poetic texts that he considered worthy of publication (including the Wen Xuan, the Chuxueji (ÂàùÂ≠∏Ë®ò), and the Baishi Liutie (ÁôΩÊ∞èÂÖ≠Â∏ñ)). Wu himself authored three volumes of commentaries on the sounds of the characters used in the Erya. It is not known when Wu died, although presumably it was before the fall of Later Shu in 965. After Later Shu's fall, Wu's son Wu Shousu (ÊØãÂÆàÁ¥†) became an official of Song Dynasty (which had conquered Later Shu), and the books that Wu had published were spread throughout the land by Wu Shousu's efforts. == Notes and references == * Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 52. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 279, 282, 288.

In January 1877, a week after the contracts were signed, but parish building committee changed its mind and it was decided to tear down the old church and build a new one. From 14‚Äì21 May 1878, the old church was torn down and construction was begun on a new Hafslo Church on the same site. The new building was consecrated on 4 December 1878. ==See also== *List of churches in Bj√∏rgvin ==References== Category:Luster, Norway Category:Churches in Vestland Category:Wooden churches in Norway Category:19th-century Church of Norway church buildings Category:Churches completed in 1878 Category:13th-century establishments in Norway ","title":"Hafslo Church"},{"id":"42014016","text":"Solvorn Church () is a parish church in Luster Municipality in Vestland county, Norway.

The fight was a WBC \\"eliminator\\" bout with the winner scheduled to become the number one contender for the WBC heavyweight title. ==Background== Lennox Lewis' previous fight had been a WBC heavyweight title defense against Oliver McCall. The then-undefeated Lewis entered the fight as an overwhelming favorite over the little-known McCall, however, McCall would stun the champion and the boxing world after landing a quick right hand that dropped Lewis. Lewis was able to get back up, but was wobbly and the referee called off the bout 31 seconds into the second round, giving McCall the upset victory and the WBC heavyweight title. Lewis attempted to quickly get a rematch and offered McCall $10 million to accept, but McCall refused and instead moved on to make the first defense against the aging Larry Holmes.McCall to Lewis: 'Keep Your Money', N.Y. Times article, 1994-10-07, Retrieved on 2014-02-16 Forced to go down the comeback trail, Lewis was matched up with the WBC's number two heavyweight Lionel Butler to determine who would be next in line for a title shot.Lewis to Fight Butler As Step to Title Bout, N.Y. Times article, 1995-03-09, Retrieved on 2014-02-16 Butler had turned around his career, going from a journeyman loser with a record of 6‚Äì10‚Äì1 in his first 17, to a bona fide heavyweight contender after stringing together 16 consecutive knockout victories (though one was rescinded after Butler failed a post-fight drug test) to bring his record up to 22‚Äì10‚Äì1. This was also Lewis' first fight with legendary trainer Emanuel Steward in his corner. Steward had previously been the head trainer of Don King-promoted fighters Oliver McCall (then the WBC heavyweight champion) and Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez (then the WBC light welterweight champion), but Steward opted to leave both fighters, as well as the chance to train boxing's most popular fighter, Mike Tyson, in order to train Lewis.The Legacy of Lennox Lewis with Emanuel Steward , Eastsideboxing.com interview with Emanuel Steward, Retrieved on 2014-02-21 The Lewis‚ÄìButler bout was part of a doubleheader boxing event that also included Michael Moorer, who like Lewis, had lost a heavyweight title in his previous match, dropping the WBA and IBF versions of the title to George Foreman the previous year. Initially, Moorer was set to face Tim Puller, but a broken hand forced Puller to pull out of the fight. Instead Moorer faced the then-up-and-coming prospect Melvin Foster.Shot at Redemption For Moorer, Lewis, San Francisco Gate article, 1995-05-13, Retrieved on 2014-02-21 Moorer would defeat Foster by a lopsided 10-round unanimous decision with three scores of 99‚Äì91 (nine rounds to one). ==The fight== Butler came into the fight well out-of-shape at 261 pounds, 30 pounds heavier than when he had started his 16-fight knockout streak in 1991, and was dominated by Lewis for the duration of the fight. Butler started the fight aggressively, hoping to catch the much taller Lewis with his powerful right hook and score an early knockout victory, even scoring with a hard right hand in the fight's first minute. Lewis, however, would use his distinct height advantage and vastly outboxed his much shorter opponent, winning all of the first four rounds on the judge's scorecards. In the fifth round, Lewis would finally end the fight. Almost immediately after the bell rang to signify the start of the round, Lewis would send Butler to the canvas after landing a right‚Äìleft combination. Butler would get up, and following a clinch break by the referee just before the first minute expired, unloaded a huge right hand that Lewis ducked. Lewis then shoved Butler down to the canvas, though it did not count as a knockdown and Lewis was warned by the referee. Lewis would spend the rest of the round picking apart the clearly exhausted Butler before sending Butler down again with a right hand just before the end of the round. After the knockdown, the referee ended the fight and Lewis was named the winner by technical knockout at 2:55 of the fifth round.Lewis knocks out Butler in fifth, Boston Globe article, 1995-05-14, Retrieved on 2014-02-13 ==Aftermath== Lewis' victory was originally supposed to make him the mandatory challenger for the WBC heavyweight title, which McCall was to defend against Frank Bruno later in the year on September 2. Bruno would win the title after defeating McCall by unanimous decision, however, the WBC bumped Lewis aside and instead made the returning Mike Tyson their number one contender, giving him the first shot at Bruno. Lewis would threaten the WBC with legal action in attempt to gain the title match with Bruno, but the WBC would ultimately rule in favor of Tyson.Ruling Favors Bruno-Tyson, N.Y.

He was born to Syedna Tayyeb Zainuddin when his father and his father's younger brother Syedna Mohammed Ezzuddin were being trained by Syedna Abdeali Saifuddin to become Da'i al-Mutlaq. His childhood was nurtured by the care and guidance of his father. His father also entrusted him to Syedi Abdeali Imaduddin to be tutored on certain knowledge imparted by the 43rd Da'i al-Mutlaq Syedna Abdeali Saifuddin.Hozefa Mohiyuddin, Tufatuh ale Akhbaare Hudat, Al Jamea tus Saifiyah Publication, 1995, pg. 67 When his father Tayyeb Zainuddin became the 45th Da'i al-Mutlaq, he was seven years old. As he grew up he accompanied his father at all times. His father educated him on the intricacies of becoming a Da'i al-Mutlaq. After the death of his father, the 46th Da'i al-Mutlaq Syedna Mohammed Badruddin educated and guided him. He was the first Da'i al-Mutlaq whose tenure was the longest amongst all the Da'i al-Mutlaq before him. For a period of more than 46 years he nurtured the members of the Dawoodi Bohra sect with fatherly care and affection. His knowledge and perseverance led the members of the Dawoodi Bohra sect out of a grave crisis that had shaken their very faith and created doubt in their beliefs.Hozefa Mohiyuddin, Tufatuh ale Akhbaare Hudat, Al Jamea tus Saifiyah Publication, 1995, pg. 68 He remained as the Da'i al-Mutlaq until 1885. While he was planning ahead as to how to clear the heavy debts of the Dawoodi Bohra sect and travelling from one place to the other to educate the members of the community, he suddenly came under the influence of an epidemic that was prevalent in Ujjain. He did nass upon Syedna Abdul Husain Husamuddin before important and high-ranking post-holders of the community.Hozefa Mohiyuddin, Tufatuh ale Akhbaare Hudat, Al Jamea tus Saifiyah Publication, 1995, pg. 69 It was in his nature to do everything possible for the happiness of the members of the Dawoodi Bohra sect. So when the members in Ujjain urged him to stay back till he recovered, he stayed back seeing their love and affection for him, knowing very well that by staying back, he would be staying there forever. His mausoleum is at Ujjain. The present Da'i is from his progeny. ==Early life== Syedna Abdul Qadir Najmuddin was born in Surat, a city in the state of Gujarat, India, where his father had shifted with his family so that he could devote more time in the service of the 43rd Da'i al- Mutlaq Syedna Abdeali Saifuddin. His father wanted to name him as 'Yusuf' but the Syedna Abdeali Saifuddin changed it to 'Abdul Qadir'. The significance of this was realized later when he became the 47th Da'i al-Mutlaq. Most of his father's time was devoted to the services of 43rd Da'i al-Mutlaq. So in his infancy he remained mostly attached with the family of Da'i al-Mutlaq. He and Syedna Mohammed Budruddin (who was 3 years older), the son of 43rd Da'i al- Mutlaq grew up together. They were together in almost everything, in their studies, in acquiring knowledge and in their positions in the community. His father Tayyeb Zainuddin became the 45th Da'i al-Mutlaq of the Dawoodi Bohra sect at the age of 38 years. His father was an efficient administrator and an eminent scholar. With his uncanny foresight he guided the Dawoodi Bohra sect to prosperity and growth. He was also well known amongst the government officials. Authoritative people of other communities also came to seek his advice. All this made the enemies of the Dawoodi Bohra sect so jealous that they tried to assassinate his father more than once. But his father was saved and protected by the grace of Allah Taala.Hozefa Moiyuddin, Tufatuh ale Akhbaare Hudat, Al Jamea tus Saifiyah Publication, 1995, pg. 87 For 16 years his father educated him in all aspects of skills and knowledge ranging from general administration to spiritual virtues required for becoming Da'i al- Mutlaq. Acquiring such diverse and valuable skills made him very determined and devoted in his service towards his father and also strengthened him for the major contribution that he had to make when he became the Da'i al-Mutlaq. ==Life before Da'i al-Mutlaq== Syedna Abdul Qadir Najmuddin's significant interactions with the members of the Dawoodi Bohra sect began at a very young age as he was closely associated to the family of Da'i al-Mutlaq and later when his father became the 45th Da'i al-Mutlaq. His father also entrusted Syedi Abdeali Imaduddin to teach him specific knowledge imparted by Syedna Abdeali Saifuddin. He was a fervent learner especially knowledge related to Prophet Muhammad and his progeny. Syedi Abdeali Imaduddin slowly and steadily transferred all the knowledge on to his heart. Syedi Abdeali Imaduddin also taught Syedna Mohammed Badruddin along with him. They both excelled in their efforts of acquiring knowledge such that his father elevated both of them to the rank of Hadiyyat (rank for learned). Later Syedna Mohammed Badruddin was made Rasul Hudood (a high-ranking title) and he was made Sadrul Hudood (a high rank below Rasul Hudood). Later when the Mazoon e Dawat (second highest position in Dawoodi Bohra sect) died his father appointed the Mukasir e Dawat (third highest position) in the position of Mazoon e Dawat and elevated the position of Syedna Mohammed Badruddin to Mukasir e Dawat and made him the Rasul Hudood. In the year 1837 Syedna Mohammed Badruddin became the 46th Da'i al-Mutlaq and he, forgetting that they were colleagues at one time, served him with the same dedication and humbleness with which he had served his father before. In the same year 1837 a huge fire broke out in Surat. The fire was raging over many houses, including the house of Da'i al-Mutlaq and other structures. The books of the Dawoodi Bohra sect were in danger of being burnt down. At such a time of catastrophe he devised a plan and made a makeshift platform inside a well. He took all the books and placed them on the platform. The fire raged wildly but passed over the well, saving all the books of the community. Syedna Mohammed Badruddin later shifted to Pune and sent back him to Surat to reconstruct and repair the burnt-down houses and other structures. During the restoration process he laid the foundation of Dars us Saify, a school for religious learning on 27th Zilqad ul Haram 1253H. And on the same day after 51 years on 27th Zilqad ul Haram 1305H Syedna Taher Saifuddin was born. A great coincidence or the revelation of a great plan! Hozefa Moiyuddin, Tufatuh ale Akhbaare Hudat, Al Jamea tus Saifiyah Publication, 1995, pg. 90 Syedna Mohammed Badruddin did nas upon Syedna Abdul Qadir Najmuddin on 9th Moharram ul Haram 1253H. Again the 46th Da'i al-Mutlaq did nas upon him during Ashura Mubarak in the on 9th Moharram ul Haram 1256H. Thereafter frequently during his sermons and other activities the 46th Da'i al-Mutlaq did nas upon him. In the year 1840 Syedna Mohammed Badruddin died leaving him at the helm of the Dawoodi Bohra sect that was on the verge of being bombarded by an enemy conspiracy. The Atba-e-Malak sub-sect is founded in 1840 and eventually settles in Nagpur. ==Life as Da'i al-Mutlaq== Mausoleum of Ibrahim Waji al- Din, Hebatullah Moayed fi-Din, and Abd al-Qadir Najm al-Din in Ujjain The succession of Syedna Abdul Qadir Najmuddin as the 47th Da'i al-Mutlaq came at a time when the enemies of the Dawoodi Bohra sect were ready to kick up a conspiracy. But the enemies were afraid to do so in the presence of Syedi Abdeali Imaduddin who was the Mukasir e Dawat at that time.Hozefa Moiyuddin, Tufatuh ale Akhbaare Hudat, Al Jamea tus Saifiyah Publication, 1995, pg. 100 Syedi Abdeali Imaduddin had served four Da'i al-Mutlaq during his lifetime. He had such immense knowledge that he was the teacher of three Da'i al-Mutlaq. He had acquired knowledge from Syedna Abdeali Saifuddin. When Syedna Abdul Qadir Najmuddin went for haj, he had done nas upon Syedi Abdeali Imaduddin. Later Syedi Abdeali Imaduddin died era of Syedna Abdul Qadir Najmuddin and the enemies picked up their weapons against the 47 Da'i al-Mutlaq. Despite all the incidents of nas done by Syedna Mohammed Badruddin upon him, the enemies of Dawoodi Bohra sect claimed that Syedna Mohammed Badruddin did not do nas upon him. This claim by the enemies created a chaos and doubt in the minds of some of the members of the community. However to all these claims by the enemies he did not say a word. He just kept on performing his activities as a Da'i al- Mutlaq as if nothing had happened. But the enemies tried very hard to make him say something against them but his patience and complacency was hard to break. This silence by him broke the backbone of the contention of the enemies as it had a two pronged effect: ::They did not have anybody to fight with. Just putting on claims without the other party responding is like clapping with one hand. It had one major disadvantage for the enemies, it did not make any noise. And without any noise their contention could not survive for long. ::He used this time to travel to the colonies of the members of Dawoodi Bohra sect and educate them about nas thus strengthing the faith of those who were still steadfast on faith and standing by him. And to bring back those members, who were disillusioned by the claims of the enemies, into the folds of the Dawoodi Bohra sect. By virtue of the knowledge imparted to him he knew exactly who will put an end to this issue. That is the reason why when one of his sons asked him, as to till when he will bear all this. He replied that the fifth Da'i al-Mutlaq from him will solve this matter. He was referring to the 51st Da'i al-Mutlaq Syedna Taher Saifuddin. The conspiracy and its effects and measures to educate the members of the community caused a great drain on the funds of the community such that a growing and prospering community began to accumulate debts. And within a period of a few years the Dawoodi Bohra sect now owed a considerable amount of money in dues. Despite all this he took great care of the members of the community; taking care of their needs, guiding them, solving their problems, teaching them and making their life easier so that they can easily follow the tenents of Islam. He took all their problems and troubles upon himself which was the reason why despite having a wealth of knowledge and great administrative skills he utilised most of his time connecting with the members of the Dawoodi Bohra sect. His tremendous knowledge and command over different languages can be seen from the fact in Sironge he did a waaz (sermon). In this waaz he used the lisan ud dawat (language of Dawoodi Bohra sect) and Urdu together in such a systematic manner that not even a single word of either language mixed with the other. His administrative skills can be seen by the fact that despite all the pressures over the community he still kept all the departments functioning and also to accommodate his absence when he has to go on a tour to educate the members of the Dawoodi Bohra sect, so much so that when Allah Taala gave him the opportunity to perform Haj, he tuned up all the functions of the offices of the community to accommodate his absence and became the first Da'i al-Mutlaq to go for Haj since the establishment of the office of Da'i al-Mutlaq. There is also a famous incident connecting Syedna Abdul Qadir Najmuddin and Maulana Ali. The incident is as follows: A famous poet wrote a poem on Maulana Ali and intended to offer the same to Maulana Ali. Maulana Ali appeared in the poet's dream and said that, if his (Maulana Ali) Dai Najmuddin accepts the poem, then he (Maulana Ali) will accept it. This poet came in the presence of Syedna Abdul Qadir Najmuddin and told him all that had transpired. He listened to the poem of the poet and accepted it in the name of Maulana Ali and rewarded the writer. He, as the 47th Da'i al-Mutlaq had elevated the position of his brother Syedna Abdul Husain Husamuddin first to the position of Mukasir e Dawat and then after four years to the position of Mazoon e Dawat.Hozefa Moiyuddin, Tufatuh ale Akhbaare Hudat, Al Jamea tus Saifiyah Publication, 1995, pg. 19, 20 29 years after this he did nas on his brother when he was in Ujjain. His brother was at Jhalawad at that time. In the nas done before the important post holders of the community he asked those present to tell his brother that he had natured the members of the Dawoodi Bohra sect with great care and affection. When someone asked for water, he had given him milk to drink. He asked his brother to show the same kind of affection. And the members of the Dawoodi Bohra community lost a Father, who loved them like a father, took care of them like a father and also did a will towards his successor to take care of them like a father.Hozefa Moiyuddin, Tufatuh ale Akhbaare Hudat, Al Jamea tus Saifiyah Publication, 1995, pg. 20 He also has link with Mohammad Rasulullah family and many noted Dawoodi Bohra Duats including Syedna Qutubuddin ShaheedFamily tree available at Risalah no.SMS00 , Year: 1435H1436H2016- as indicated below.

The extensive complex has a maximum generating capacity of 4,710 megawatts. It is the largest power station in Indonesia and the 10th largest coal-fired power station in the world. ==History of the plant== The history of the construction of the power complex, along with the financial arrangements, involved considerable controversy in the wake of the 1997-98 financial crisis in Indonesia.'Common sense a must in Paiton row' , The Jakarta Post, 24 December 1999. See also 'Govt to take action over alleged KKN in Paiton deal' , The Jakarta Post, 24 December 1999. The firm decision to begin construction of the complex was taken in April 1994 after negotiations which had commenced some years earlier. The construction of the Paiton complex was seen as important because it was part of an ambitious program announced in the mid 1990s in Indonesia to construct 27 power plants in cooperation with the private sector through IPP (Independent Power Producer) arrangements.The World Bank-affiliate MIGA (Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency) was involved in providing some guarantees for the Paiton project. Brief details are at a MIGA Paiton Brief. But following the 1997-98 financial crisis in Indonesia, the IPP arrangements were widely regarded in Indonesia as inappropriate contracts which, as a result of faulty contract negotiations, had passed an excessive allocation of financial risk onto the Indonesian state.For an extensive survey of the experience in Indonesia in the late 1990s in aiming to develop the electric power sector in cooperation with the private sector, see Louis T. Wells, \\"Private power in Indonesia\\", Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies, Vol 43, No 3, December 2007, pp.341-365. According to the original contract signed between the Indonesian state-owned electric power company Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) and PT Paiton, PLN was to pay PT Paiton a price of slightly over US 8 cents/kWh during the first 12 years of operation of the plant. However, following the dramatic plunge in the value of the rupiah during the 1997-98 crisis, PLN's financial situation deteriorated sharply (because many of the costs of the PLN were in $US while revenues were in rupiahs). In 1999, the PLN therefore moved to demand that the contract be renegotiated.'PLN moves to cancel Paiton contract' , The Jakarta Post, 8 October 1999. After difficult negotiations, agreement was reached in mid-2002 for the PLN to pay PT Paiton a reduced price of slightly less than US 5 cents/kWh for part of the output from the Paiton complex.A'an Suryana, 'Government, PT Paiton reach power deal' , The Jakarta Post, 5 July 2002. More recently, the capacity of the plants at the site was extended. In 2004 it was announced by one of the firms operating at the complex, PT Paiton Energy, that an additional 800 MW (expected to cost around $US 850 million) would be added to the 1,290 MW capacity that the firm operated at the site.Tony Hotland, 'Paiton Energy will expand power plant' , The Jakarta Post, 8 June 2004. In 2007, PLN started construction of Paiton Unit 9 in cooperation with Harbin Power Engineering Company Limited (now known as Harbin Electric International Company limited). Unit 9 power plant, owned by PT PLN, is a sub-critical plant. In mid 2012, PT Paiton Energy (a joint venture between French and Japanese companies) launched the commercial operation of the unit (rated at 815 MW) adding around 5% to the capacity of the Java-Bali power grid.Rabby Pramudatama, 'Java-Bali grid gets 5 percent boost from Paiton-3', The Jakarta Post, 6 June 2012. ==Ownership arrangements== The Paiton power generation complex is made up of a number of power generation units under different ownership.

The chaplains are to provide \\"support and guidance about ethics, values, relationships and spirituality\\", and is based on pastoral care, not religious instruction. The grants are $20,000 a year for schools and $24,000 for schools in remote areas. ==History== In October 2006, the Howard Government established NSCP, at an expected cost of $90 million, to provide $20,000 grants for schools to employ chaplains.The Age, 29 October 2006: School chaplain plan unveiledSMH, 31 October 2006: Chaplain program is no crusade: PM In Australia, chaplains in state schools have, controversially, been funded by the federal government since 2007, as well as local communities. Chaplaincy services are provided by religious service companies which are predominantly Christian, though non-denominational within Christianity, including Scripture Union Queensland, Genr8 Ministries in NSW and Access Ministries. As of 2008, there were 2,850 chaplains employed under NSCP.The Australian, 8 December 2008: School chaplains 'worked miracles' On 7 September 2011, Peter Garrett, Education Minister in the Gillard Government, announced a number of changes in NSCP. New chaplains were to be required to have a \\"Certificate IV in Youth Work, Pastoral Care or an equivalent qualification\\", while previously no formal qualifications were required. The changes also offered schools the option to employ, instead of \\"a religious support worker\\" (chaplain), a \\"secular student well-being officer\\", following concerns over the appropriateness of having a religious worker in a public school. Previously schools were only able to hire a secular welfare worker under the programme if they could demonstrate that their efforts to find an ordained chaplain had failed. On 27 September 2013 there were 2,339 chaplains and 512 student welfare workers employed under NSCP. In May 2014, the Abbott Government removed the provision to fund secular student well-being officers, meaning all chaplains had to be affiliated with a religion. In the 2014 federal budget, the government increased the funds for NSCP to $243.8 million over a four-year period. Following the invalidation of NSCP by the High Court in June 2014, the Government redesigned NSCP, with funding now being delivered via states and territories rather than directly to schools. The new NSCP did not involve any other changes to policy.SMH, 27 August 2014: Tony Abbott to keep secular workers out of school chaplaincy program Agreements for the new NSCP were reached with all state and territory governments by 17 November 2014.SMH, 10 October 2014: School chaplaincy program: government stands firm on excluding welfare workers ==High Court challenges2012 High Court challenge=== In the High Court case of Williams v The Commonwealth of Australia & Ors [2012] HCA 23 (also known as the \\"School chaplains case\\")http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment- summaries/2012/hca23-2012-06-20.pdf the executive prerogative and spending under section 61 of the Australian Constitution was challenged. The Court handed down its ruling in June 2012, that the Commonwealth's funding agreement for NSCP was invalid. ===2014 High Court challenge=== A second High Court challenge, against the amended programme, was mounted by the 2012 litigant and was heard by the Court in May 2014. The High Court handed down its ruling on 19 June 2014.AustLII: Williams v Commonwealth of Australia [2014 HCA 23 (19 June 2014) ] The focus of this case was whether the federal government has the power to fund the NSCP directly through local organisations. This second challenge also succeeded so that over $154 million in funding hitherto paid to a local organisation in Queensland became a debt. However, the federal government responded by waiving that debt and making a commitment to circumvent the High Court ruling and continue with the budgeted $243 million spending on NSCP. ==Religious representation== While the NSCP is formally not religion-specific, the chaplains employed under the programme are disproportionately Christian. In 2011, one study stated that 96.5% of the chaplains employed under the programme were Christian, while only 64% of Australians identified as Christian (based on the 2006 census). By contrast, 0.01% of the chaplains were secular, whereas 19% of Australians identified as having no religion. Buddhism, the second largest religion, is followed by 2% of Australians, but only 0.03% of the school chaplains. Islam was followed by 1.7% of Australians, but only 0.9% of school chaplains. Judaism is the only religion which had a roughly proportionate representation, with 0.45% of the Australian population following the religion, and 0.5% of school chaplains. It was announced in May 2014 that the provision to allow secular welfare workers under NSCP would be removed, changing the definition of chaplain to someone ordained, commissioned or endorsed by a recognised religious institution. From December 2014, the 623 schools who were then hiring a secular welfare worker had to either hire a chaplain instead or go without either. ==Reception== NSCP has been controversial since it was announced by John Howard in 2006. The NSCP is most commonly opposed on the grounds that chaplains are under-qualified to deal with vulnerable young people, that it is not appropriate to have a religious worker in a public school, and that the money spent on the programme is better needed elsewhere, such as to help children with disabilities. A July 2011 report by the Commonwealth Ombudsman recommended changes in guidelines after it was found that some chaplains provided one-on-one counselling when not qualified to do so. Complaints have also been made that chaplains have used their position to recruit children to Christianity in breach of government guidelines. The number of complaints specifically regarding proselytising was 34 in 2011, 5 in 2012 and 1 in 2013. Complaints have also been made that chaplains have handed out literature stating homosexuality is wrong, that condoms promote promiscuity and are not effective for use as a contraceptive. Overall complaints about any aspect of the chaplaincy programme that were made to the relevant department was 93 in 2011, 51 in 2012 and 34 in 2013. Of the 85 between 2012 and 2013, 60% could not be substantiated. An online petition opposing the 2014 funding increase for the NSCP was signed by over 180,000 people. In 2010 whilst she was Prime Minister, Julia Gillard voiced her support for the NSCP. In 2011 Peter Garrett publicly stated his support for the programme, though in a 2014 book review he stated \\"the line between chaplains acting to support students in the provision of general pastoral care and proselytising was too easily crossed\\". Other politicians supporting the programme include Senator Eric Abetz. The Australian Psychological Society has repeatedly criticised the NSCP. The director of the Black Dog Institute has expressed concern at the funding of chaplaincy over programmes backed by scientific evidence.

It was constructed in 1904 by William Van Zant Jobes who relocated to St. Johns from Spokane, Washington. He died in 1907 and his sons took over the mill. In 1910, William Haskell Jobes died leaving sole ownership to his brother Allan R. Jobes. He sold the mill in 1918 and died three years later. The Rose City Flour Mill operated the mill as a subsidiary until the building was demolished in 1930. ==History== William Van Zant Jobes of Rockford, Illinois erected the Jobes Milling Company in St. Johns, Oregon in 1904 after leaving his son's flour mill in Spokane, Washington. At its inception, the mill could produce 400 barrels of flour a day. During a citywide fire in 1905, the mill was spared damage. Jobes ran for mayor of St. Johns in 1905, but lost to W. H. King. That same year he was discovered by a woman from Washington who said he failed to pay back a loan she made out to him in Spokane. According to a city attorney, Jobes used the loan to purchase lumber for a new mill in Spokane but sold it when he decided to relocate to St. Johns, Oregon. Jobes died in his office at the mill on July 9, 1907. Following his death his sons, Allan R. and William Haskell Jobes took over the ownership of the mill. They sued the City of St. Johns in 1910 saying that a planned sewer would runoff into their property. A judge allowed the city to continue with the construction. William Haskell Jobes died of heart disease in 1911, leaving his brother Allan R. Jobes as the sole owner. By 1917 the mill was producing 500 barrels of flour per day. In 1918 the mill was purchased by the Rose City Flour Mill, who used it as a subsidiary. The new owners planned to double the production of barrels per day. Allan R. Jobes died in 1920. The flour mill was demolished in 1930 and a lumber mill was constructed in its place. ==See also== * Portland Woolen Mills * St. Johns City Hall * St. Johns Twin Cinema ==References== Category:Food and drink companies established in 1904 Category:Privately held companies based in Oregon Category:1904 establishments in Oregon Category:Defunct companies based in Oregon Category:Manufacturing companies based in Portland, Oregon Category:1930 disestablishments in Oregon Category:Buildings and structures in St. Johns, Portland, Oregon Category:Companies based in St. Johns, Portland, Oregon Category:Food and drink companies disestablished in 1930 ","title":"Jobes Milling Company"},{"id":"42014445","text":"Axel Koenders (born 28 September 1959) was one of the strongest triathlon competitors of the 1980s in the Netherlands.

The one to the right (from the viewer's perspective) is the chimi, and to the left is the m≈çry≈ç. Chimim≈çry≈ç () is a term that refers to monsters of the mountains and monsters of the rivers. The term originated in China roughly 2,500 years ago in ancient chronicles such as the Zuo Zhuan. It refers to various kinds of obake and things changed into y≈çkai. \\"Chimi\\" () refers to the monsters of the mountains, and \\"m≈çry≈ç\\" () refers to the monsters of the river, and so the word \\"chimim≈çry≈ç\\" is often used to refer to all monsters of the mountains and rivers. Furthermore, the word \\"minori\\" was also used for this. For this to be used to mean a \\"ripening\\" (minoru) oni has been used in various regions since ancient times. ==ExplanationChimi=== Chimi are said to be monsters that come about from strange atmosphere (miasma) in mountains and forests. Taking on an appearance with the face of a human, and the body of a beast, they would perplex humans. In the dictionary Wamy≈ç Ruijush≈ç from the Heian period, they were considered to be a type of oni under the Japanese name \\"sudama\\", and in the Edo period encyclopedia, the Wakan Sansai Zue, they were seen to be mountain gods (Yama-no-Kami). ===M≈çry≈ç=== M≈çry≈ç are considered to be spirits from mountains and rivers, and trees and rocks. They would come forth from the life energy of mountains, water, trees, rocks, and all kinds of things in nature, and fool humans. They are also said to eat the dead, have the appearance of a child, stand on two feet, have dark red skin, have red eyes, long ears, beautiful hair, and a voice that resembles that of a human. With this kind of appearance, they are thought to be oni. In the Wakan Sansai Zue, they are considered water gods (Suijin), and in the ancient Chinese book Zuo Zhuan, they are considered to be gods of swamps and marshes. ==Etymology== There are many theories about its etymology. According to the Chinese Records of the Grand Historian (during the period of the Five Emperors), a is a mountain god that took on the shape of a tiger, and a is a swamp or marsh god taking on a shape with the head of a beast. It is surmised that from this that the word was seen to mean expanded to encompass beasts of various attributes. ==ReferencesSee also== *Y≈çkai *Tsukumogami *Mononoke *Hyakki Yagy≈ç *Oni Category:Japanese folklore Category:Y≈çkai ","title":"Chimim≈çry≈ç"},{"id":"42014472","text":"Huang Qishan (; born March 23, 1968) is a Chinese recording artist and musician.

Embranthiris are Brahmins who migrated to Kerala from the Tulu Nadu (present day Udupi in Karnataka). Even though settled in Kerala, most of the Embranthiries still speak Tulu as mother-tongue, and are considered as Tulu Brahmins. Some sects of Embranthiris have adopted the Malayali Brahmin surnames \\"Namboothiri\\" and \\"Potti\\" after arriving in Kerala. They are the followers of Vaishnavism. Because of their Vaishnava Dharma they mainly serve in Vishnu temples, Krishna temples and more than other gods. ==History== During AD 1238‚Äì1317 some families of Brahmins in Tulu Nadu started following their acharya (Spiritual leader) Madhvacharya, They created some groups and followed Madhvacharya and his views, later they are called as Tulu Brahmins or Embrandriri. Under the guidance of Sri Madhvacharya the community strongly followed Vishnavism and they done Vishnu and on temples. Embranthiries where specialized in because of their vast knowledge in vedas and mantras. Their spiritual leader is Madhvacharya. Madhvacharya was a critic of Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta and Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita Vedanta teachings. He toured India several times, visiting places such as Bengal, Varanasi, Dwarka, Goa and Kanyakumari, engaging in philosophical debates and visiting Hindu centers of learning. Madhva established the Krishna Mutt at Udupi with a murti secured from Dwarka Gujarat in AD 1285. After that Uduppi Sree Krishna Bhagavan Became their prime god and Madhva's Krishna Mutt Uduppi Became their Capital. Udupi, Sri Krishna Temple established by Madhvacharya ===Founder Of Tulu Brahmin / Embrandhiri caste=== Madhva Acharya (Sanskrit pronunciation: [m…ôdÃ™ ± ã…ëÀêÀàt É…ëÀêrj…ô]; AD 1238‚Äì1317), also known as Purna Praj√±a and Ananda Tƒ´rtha, was a Hindu philosopher and the chief proponent of the Dvaita (dualism) school of Vedanta founded Tulu Brahmin caste. Madhva called his philosophy as \\"Tattvavaadaa\\" meaning \\"the realist viewpoint\\". He was a critic of Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta and Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita Vedanta teachings. Madhva established the Krishna Mutt at Udupi with a murti secured from Dwarka Gujarat in AD 1285. In several historic books, Madhvacharya is described as the third avatar or incarnation of Vayu, wind god, the son of Vishnu. He is described as like Hanuman‚Äîthe first avatar of Vayu, and Bhima, a Pandava in the Mahabharata and the second avatar of Vayu. In one of his bhasya on the Brahma Sutras, he asserts that the authority of the text is from his personal encounter with Vishnu. Tulu Brahmins or Embrandiries believed Madvacharya as avathar of Sree Vishnu Bhagavan, and he will guide the latter in their journey towards Vishnu. == Madhvacharya == MadhvƒÅcƒÅrya was born on the west coast of Karnataka state in 13th-century India. As a teenager, he became a Sanyasin (monk) joining Brahma-sampradaya guru Achyutapreksha, of the Ekadandi order. Madhva studied the classics of Hindu philosophy, particularly the Principal Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita and the Brahma Sutras (Prasthanatrayi). He commented on these, and is credited with thirty seven works in Sanskrit. His writing style was of extreme brevity and condensed expression. His greatest work is considered to be the Anuvyakhyana, a philosophical supplement to his bhasya on the Brahma Sutras composed with a poetic structure. In some of his works, he proclaimed himself to be an avatar of Vayu, the son of god Vishnu.Sabapathy Kulandran and Hendrik Kraemer (2004), Grace in Christianity and Hinduism, James Clarke, , pages 177‚Äì179 == Culture/Holy Central == City of Udupi in Karnataka, India is the cultural central or holy place for Tulu Brahmins (embrandiri). The main area resembles a living ashram, a holy place for daily devotion and living. Surrounding the Sri Krishna Matha are several temples namely the Udupi Anantheshwara Temple which is over a 1,000 years old was Founded by Sri Madhvacharya. The Krishna Matha was founded by the Vaishnavite saint Shri Madhwacharya in the 13th century. He was the founder of the Dvaita school of Vedanta. It is believed that Madhwacharya found the murti of SriKrishna in a large ball of gopichandana. == Present day == During the times of the British Empire many Embrandiri Tulu Brahmin families moved from udupi to several places of India. Most of the families moved to Kerala because of culture and tradition of Kerala Brahmins (Namboothiri) is very much close enough to their culture. They moved to several places of Kerala and founded Madams as their home. Later they used Madam as their family name. == Philosophy == Embrandiries are the followers of Lord Vishnu. Their Acharya/Leader Sree Madvaacharya was a founded Udupi math and the main god of Udupi manth Udupi Sree Krishna became their prime god and they followed Vishnavism. Vaishnavism (Vaishnava dharma) is one of the major traditions within Hinduism along with Shaivism, Shaktism, and Smartism. It is also called Vishnuism, its followers are called Vaishnavas, and it considers Vishnu as the Supreme Lord. Because of their Vishnava dharma they mainly served Vishnu Temples, Krishna Temples and Yagams more than other gods. The tradition is known for the loving devotion to an avatar of Vishnu, and it has been key to the spread of Bhakti movement in South Asia in the 2nd millennium CE. Key texts in Vaishnavism include the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Pancaratra (Agama) texts and the Bhagavata Purana. An estimated 200 million Vaishnavas live in India. Although Vishnu was a Vedic solar deity, he is mentioned less often compared to Agni, Indra and other Vedic deities, thereby suggesting that he had a minor position in the Vedic religion. Other scholars state that there are other Vedic deities, such as water deity Nara (also mentioned as Narayana-Purusha in the Brahmanas layer of the Vedas), who together form the historical roots of Vaishnavism. In the late-Vedic texts (~1000 to 500 BCE), the concept of a metaphysical Brahman grows in prominence, and the Vaishnavism tradition considered Vishnu to be identical to Brahman, just like Shaivism and Shaktism consider Shiva and Devi to be Brahman respectively. The Vaishnava tradition has many sampradayas (denominations, sub-schools) ranging from the medieval era Dvaita school of Sri Madhvacharya to Vishishtadvaita school of Ramanuja. New Vaishnavism movements have been founded in the modern era such as the ISKCON of Prabhupada. ==References== Category:Brahmin communities of Kerala Category:Culture of Kerala ","title":"Embranthiri"},{"id":"42014560","text":"A beauty parade is a synonym for a formal presentation given to a panel in response to a request for tender.

It turns out that young Katy is not focused in her studies; rather, she is prone to playing around with her schoolmates. After the teacher finishes her speech, Tatay tells her that he will discipline his daughter regarding the issue, only to end up in shock when he finds out that his daughter has been kicked out of school. When Tatay angrily calls for young Katy, she is found to be hiding in the chest again.

Shocked, she tries to return the money to the man, but he insists that the money is for her. Young Katy then screams and proceeds to run home to her father, telling him that they will be rich. Scene 6 At the cinema, Tatay is standing behind the curtain, still trying to convince the now 15-year-old Katy to pursue something else other than performing. Teen Katy tells her father that she is making more money now and that she can afford to buy her parents anything they want. Tatay explains to Katy the difficulties in the theater life, especially for women. Katy then tells her dad to not worry, and that the both of them can take on any challenges that lie ahead. They are interrupted by a voice telling Katy that it's her turn to sing again. After her performance, she goes back to where Tatay is standing. Tatay then tells her that an American came by to ask him if Katy could perform in Teatro Lux. When Katy starts to get excited again, Tatay tells her that she needs to learn the songs and their lyrics.

He was the pioneer in the revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, after the decline of the religion in the 17th and 18th centuries. Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero was bestowed with the Sangharaja title by king Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe in 1753, the same year he received the Upasampada (higher ordination of Buddhist monks) and re- established the Upasampada in Sri Lanka with the help of Mahasangha in Thailand. He is also credited with the establishment of Silvath Samagama (pious group), a union of monks who lived in accordance with the Buddhist monastic discipline.Buddhism regained, Sunday Times ==Early years== Welivita Waththe Walawwa in Tumpane, where Sri Saranankara thero was born Welivita Sri Saranakara Thera was born on June 19, 1698 to the Kulathunga family of Welivita Waththe Walawwa in Tumpane, about 24 km from Kandy. His father was a chieftain and was a descendant of an influential family.Sri Sangharaja perahera of Kandy, Samarasinghe, Nirmala, Daily News, 3 July 2012, His lay name was Kulathunga Banda and he had a brother by the name of Kulatunga Patabendige Mudiyanse. Though his parents initially opposed his idea to enter the Buddhist monastic order, later he was granted permission by the parents and was ordained as a 'samanera‚Äô at the age of 16, under the scholar monk, Suriyagoda Rajaguru thera, who was the incumbent of Sri Narendraramaya at Yatinuwara. After the ordination as a novice monk, young boy Kulatunga was known as Welivita Sri Saranakara Samanera. His teacher, Suriyagoda Rajaguru thera, who had received upasampada ordination from the Arakanese monks (Burmese) in 1679, exercised considerable influence within the Kandyan Kingdom and had the patronage of King Vira Narendrasinghe (1707‚Äì39). He was the last Sinhala king, after whom Nayakkar dynasty succeeded to the throne of Kandyan kingdom. In 1715, Suriyagoda thera was charged with treason by the king and executed. Thus young Saranankara Samanera left on his own, took up residence in the mountainous region of Alagalla (Kadugannwa) a few miles away from Kandy and devoted his early years to learning Pali language. Saranakara Samanera lived in a cave at Alagalla and the villagers provided him with alms food.The Scholar Buddhist monks of the 19th Century in the low country, The Island, Rohan L. Jayetilleke During that time, almost all the Buddhist clergy were known as Ganinnanses or as Samaneras, as there was no way of them receiving the upasampada, to qualify as a fully ordained Bhikku. Higher ordination Upasampada became defunct in the era as a result of the decline of Buddhism due to colonial invasion of the maritime provinces of Sri Lanka. Education of the novice monks has been neglected as there was no one capable to teach the basic components of Pali grammar. Welivita Saranakara Samanera was able to learn the principles of Pali grammar from Levuke Ralahamy, who had studied it from Watabuluwe Thera. His tutor Leuke Ralahamy was a one, who had been imprisoned by the king in a village close to Alagalla, where Saranankara samanera resided after the execution of his teacher Suriyagoda thera. With great effort and devotion he expanded his knowledge in Pali language and Buddhist doctrine, for which purpose he traveled from place to place in search of books and tutors. Later he went about preaching Buddha Dhamma to encourage others to rise up for the welfare of the religion. This behavior of Weliwita Saranankara Samanera made him popular as a teacher as well as a preacher. In addition to his skill as a scholar he was also known for his austere practices, kindness, purity of thought and attachment to religious life, which were rare qualities. His habit to help the poor earned him the epithet Asarana Sarana, the one who helps the helpless. Although the Buddhist clergy known as Ganninnanse were living like laymen and forgotten their sacred calling, they were getting their alms to the temples regularly. The young Saranankara Samanera, as an objection against the manner in which Ganinnanses' lived in that era, refused to accept the food that brought to the temples, and led an exemplary life of real priesthood. He depended for his sustenance on the ancient practice of Buddhist monks known as Pindapata, gathering ones food from house to house in his alms-bowl. Because of this practice, he earned the epithet Pindapathika Saranankara. During this period few like-minded companions and followers began to gather around Weliwita Sri Saranankara Samanera. The earliest and most intimate of them were Sitinamaluwe Dhammajothi, Ilipangamuwe and Kadiragoda, who came from the south of the island. They formed themselves into a small fraternity called Silvat Samagama and its members were called silvat tenas (pious ones) distinguishing themselves from other samaneras and ganinnanses. Weliwita Saranankara Samanera's lifelong ambition was to re-establish upasampada ordination in the island. ==Revival of upasampada== The behaviour of the Buddhist monks in the early 18th century in Sri Lanka was deeply deteriorated and did not conform to the 'vinaya', monastic discipline accepted for the bhikkus. Most of them had close association with women and some had children by them. In view of their immoral behaviour, they did not receive either the reverence or the honour of the laity, who ignominiously called them 'ganai' or 'ganaya', who differed from the laity only by their yellow robe. At that point of time there were no erudite monks to deliver discourses to the laity and it was very difficult to find five higher ordained Buddhist monks to offer a 'sanghika-dana' (alms giving) in the entire country. Ganninnanse only read the Jataka-potha (book on the previous lives of the Buddha), to the laymen who assembled to hear the discourses on Dhamma. The main reason for the decline of Buddhism during this period was mainly due to the infiltration of Catholicism, which spread because of the tolerance of the kings, who gave a free hand to the missionaries to spread their faith. This decline further increased with the division of the Buddhist monks into two groups as 'Silvats' and 'Ganinnanses'.Upasampada: Its revival and continuance, Sunday Times-Kandy Times, Senaratne L.B. The Portuguese and Dutch influence in the Kandyan Kingdom over the Sinhalese were such that the Sinhalese began to assimilate foreign customs, ways of life, dress and language resulting in transformation of their local life style. It was inevitable that these foreign customs seeped into the Buddhist monks as well.Ven. Welivita Saranankara Thera and revival of Upasampada, Daily News, Jayasinghe Cecil During this period Weliwita Sri Saranankara Samanera, who led the Silvat monks (monks who behaved according to the monastic discipline) was entrusted with the task of tutoring prince Vijaya Rajasinghe, young brother- in-law of King Vira Narendrasinghe. Since the king had no children from his main consort, the young brother-in-law of the king was the next in line for the throne of Kandyan Kingdom. With the appointment of Vijaya Rajasinghe to the throne in 1739, Welivita Sri Saranankara had the opportunity to make a direct influence to the king. He managed to persuade the king by 1741 to negotiate with the Dutch, who were ruling maritime provinces to accommodate a delegation to Siam (now Thailand), to revive the higher ordination, Upasampada. The king got the assistance of the Dutch to send a delegation to Siam, which was unsuccessful. Several members of the delegation died when the ship they traveled sank on the way while the survivors returned to Sri Lanka. A second delegation which was dispatched in 1745, led by one of the survivors of the first delegation successfully reached Siam, but could not conclude the negotiations due to the untimely death of the king Vijaya Rajasinghe. The King of Siam was reluctant to send Siamese monks to revive the monastic lineage of Sri Lanka without knowing what the attitude of the new king would be in this matter. After the demise of King Vijaya Rajasinghe in 1747, Kirti Sri Rajasinha was appointed as the King of Kandyan kingdom. The reign of king Kirti Sri Rajasinha brought a new energy to the revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Weliwita Sri Saranankara Samanera extended his fullest corporation to the new king who depended on him for advice, guidance and inspiration. He urged the king to send a third embassy to Siam with the help of Dutch East India Company for the revival of Upasampada. The third delegation which left Kandy in July 1751 made it to Trincomalee and left Sri Lanka's shores later in the same month. The mission was successful and the king of Siam Borommakot accepted the request of king Kirti Sri Rajasinha and sent a delegation of twenty, headed by Upali Maha Thera to Sri Lanka. Two years later the delegation with Upali Thera was able to set sail back to Sri Lanka and reached Trincomalee in May 1753 after leaving Siam in January, 1753. The delegation which was headed by Upali Thera, composed of higher ordained Siamese monks, who entered Kandy in June 1753. ==Appointed Sangaraja== Kirti Sri Rajasinha appointed Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero as the Sangharaja of Sri Lanka. At the age of 55 years, Weliwita Sri Saranankara Samanera received the 'upasampada' and qualified as a higher ordained monk on the Esala poya day in 1753 at the Malwatu Maha Viharaya.Entering the holy path, Sunday Times King Kirti Sri Rajasinha and his ministers proceeded to Malwatta Viharaya and presented Weliwita Sri Saranankara thera with the insignia of the office of Sangharaja in a grand assembly of Buddhist monks. Welivita Sri Saranankara thero was the last Sri Lankan monk to hold the prestigious Sangharaja title, which is the highest office conferred on a monk in a Theravada Buddhist country.Collected Wheel Publications Volume VII: Numbers 90‚Äì100 (Buddhist Publication Society), Nyanaponika Thera, Bhikkhu Khantipalo, G.P. Malalasekera, Narada Thera, Mahinda Thera, H.R. Perera After becoming the Sangharaja, he was involved extensively with activities to revive the Buddha Sasana by assisting the monks, in particular the samanera or novice monks to pursue their learning and service to the nation. He was not interested in material possessions such as land, buildings and property in general. His interest was focused on the development and the welfare of the monks that he led in Sri Lanka. He traveled extensively in the country, especially in the south to organize and restore the former prestige of the Buddhism and Buddhist monks in Sri Lanka. After rendering a great service to the Buddha Sasana by re-establishing the higher ordination ritual of Upasampadha in the country, Weliwita Sri Saranankara Mahathera died at the age of 80 on the full moon poya day in July 1778. He died at the forest hermitage near Hantana, while observing 'vas' (retreat). It was his favourite forest abode, which is situated a few miles from Kandy. He was listening to the ‚ÄúSathipattana‚Äù with right mindfulness, recited by Malinbada Gunarathana thero at the time of his death. ==Literary works== The activities of Weliwita Sri Saranankara thero led to the re-establishment of Upasampada (higher ordination) and restored the purity of the Buddhism in the country. In addition to that his leadership and influence also brought a literary revival as a result of the impetus given by him to the education of Pali language and Buddha's teachings. Welivita Sri Saranankara thera compiled many important religious literary works and several other pupils of Weliwita Sri Saranankara thera also composed many literary works. The books such as the Munigunalankara, a Sinhalese poem in praise of Buddha, the Sarartha Sangraha, a treatise on various doctrinal teachings of Buddhist philosophy and Abhisambodhialankara, a Pali poem on the life of Bodhisattva from the times of Dipankara Buddha up to his enlightenment are some examples for his religious literary work. The Madhurartha Prakasini, which is a Sinhalese commentarial paraphrase to the Pali Mahabodhivamsa and the Rupamala, a work on Pali grammar are also his literary creations. ==References *Weliwita Sri Saranankara Sangharaja Museum Category:1698 births Category:1778 deaths Category:Theravada Buddhist monks Category:Sri Lankan Theravada Buddhists Category:Sri Lankan Buddhist monks Category:People of the Kingdom of Kandy Category:Buddhist revivalists Category:18th-century writers Category:Sinhalese monks ","title":"Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero"},{"id":"42014622","text":"Ineke is Dutch feminine given name.

It is represented by a single species, the crisp pillow coral (Anomastraea irregularis). ==Description== The crisp pillow coral forms small, mound-like colonies that grow to be about 20 cm in height and make a blue-grey and cream color. Like other corals that form colonies, it consists of soft, little polyps that are assisted with small tentacles that guide food in the water to the coral's mouth. The polyps discharge a skeleton known as corallite which would participate in the formation of coral reefs. The corallites establish an uneven honey-comb pattern. As a member of the family Siderastreidae, it is a zooxanthellate, living in harmony with zooxanthellae, a unicellular algae, which aids the coral in its growth and survival. The coral protects the algae with its tissue as the algae helps the host with energy and nutrients, as well as removing metabolic waste. However, the crisp pillow coral is restricted to staying in shallow waters where the zooxanthellae can execute photosynthesis. ==Distribution== The crisp pillow coral is found on the East African coast, the southern area of the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, north and southwestern Indian Ocean, and the Persian Gulf. However, it is not found in the Chagos Archipelago. It is also known in small areas around Madagascar and islands near it. It is populated in shallow and sandy, tropical coral reef systems. At the base of the reefs and intertidal pools, it lives in turbid water, usually to about 20 m in depth. ==Diet== Although the zooxanthellae provides about 70% of the coral's nutrients through photosynthesis, the coral may also prey upon zooplankton, dissolved organic matter, and planktonic bacteria. ==Threats== The crisp pillow coral is threatened to extinction with a decreasing population. The principal threat is the rising sea temperature due to global warming and the increasing climate. This expels the zooxanthellae from the coral, leaving it weak and prone to many diseases without the aid of the algae. The climate change also is expected to increase ocean acidification and destructive weather, such as storms that destroy the coral reefs. The crown- of-thorns starfish is a voracious predator of coral reefs. Since the 1970s, an increasing population of the crown-of-thorns starfish has broken out, consuming more corals in the reefs. Human activity has caused the outbreak of the crown-of-thorn starfish. The overfishing of unprotected reefs may deplete much of the population of the predators of the crown-of-thorn starfish, such as the humphead wrasse. The triton snail, another natural predator, is being collected for its valuable shell. Nutrients from agriculture wash off to the oceans, causing phytoplanktons population increases, which gives more food for the starfish larvae. Other causes of the declining population of the crisp pillow coral are pollution, destructive fishing practices, human activity, and invasive species. ==Conservation== The crisp pillow coral is listed on the Appendix II of CITES, protecting the species from being traded without a permit. Current research is being conducted to ensure the safety of the crisp pillow coral. ==References== Category:Scleractinia genera Category:Monotypic cnidarian genera Category:Siderastreidae Category:Animals described in 1901 ","title":"Anomastraea"},{"id":"42014732","text":"Adam Barwood (born 30 July 1992, in Queenstown, New ZealandFIS BiographySochi 2014 profile) is an alpine skier from New Zealand.

In January 1856, a representative group of Tibet came to Kathmandu for discussion of the treaty. After a long discussion, the representative group ultimately signed in Thapathali a treaty on 24 March. == Failure of first attempt== A meeting of delegation teams was called in Shikarjong but no decision was made. Nepali delegation team returned as they were to discuss with prime minister, Jung Bahadur Rana. In the meeting with Tibetan delegation, Jung Bahadur demanded one crore rupees for expenses of war and for returning the Tibetan land captured by Nepal. It was very hard for Tibetan delegation to make such a decision so Kaji Til Bikram was sent to Sikarjong along with the Tibetan in September. The ambassador of China replied with proud that he can give four lakhs rupees for war expenses and five lakhs rupees as penantly for the destruction of Nepalese troops in Lhasa. The ambassador also replied that the Tibet is a state of China and the Emperor gave it to Nuns only for religious purpose so Tibet was not subjected to give even one palm length of land to Nepal; if Nepal did not returned immediately from Tibet then Nepal must be ready to fight war with China. As Nepalese were not in support of this condition, the attempt of Treaty failed. ==Second attempt and its Terms== # Tibet Government have to pay 10,000 Nepalese rupees to Nepal Government per year. # Tibet and Nepal agree to regard the Chinese Emperor as the sovereign. In case any foreign country attacked Tibet, Nepal Government have to help Tibet Government. Also in case if Nepal is attacked, Tibet government have to preserve the Nepalese wealth and have to transfer wealth in safest place in Tibet. The expenditure during this transfer have to be paid by Tibet Government for first two months and by Nepal Government after that. # In trade between Tibet and Nepal, Tibet government will not impose custom duty for Nepalese products. Also the custom duty imposed on Nepalese products up to the period of treaty will also be forgiven. # Tibet government have to submit all the war prisoners and arms of Nepal. Also the Nepal government have to submit war prisoners and yaks taken during the war. # For the care of Nepalese businessman, from this time onward a Courtier(‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞) will be appointed instead of Nayak(‡§®‡§æ‡§Ø‡§ï) as a representative. # All Nepalese are allowed to do business in Tibet without any hindrance. With exception of Armed soldiers, all Nepali are allowed to travel freely in Tibet. # Nepali representative won't interfere in Tibet's internal affairs, also in case of dispute within Nepal, Tibet government won't interfere. But for dispute between Tibetan and Nepali, both governments will appoint one representative each for settlement of disputes. The penalty paid by Tibetan and Nepali during the disputes will be given to Tibet government and Nepali government respectively. # If any murderer escaped from a country and resides in other country, the latter will submit the culprit to concerned government. # If any citizen of one country theft the citizens of other, the former government shall make all the provisions for returning materials and punish culprit. ==See also== *Thapathali Durbar *History of Nepal *Tibet under Qing rule *Sino-Nepalese War *Nepalese‚ÄìTibetan War *China-Nepal relations ==References== Category:Treaties concluded in 1856 Category:Treaties of Nepal Category:Treaties of Tibet Category:1850s in Tibet Category:19th century in Nepal Category:Nepal‚ÄìTibet relations ","title":"Treaty of Thapathali"},{"id":"42014772","text":"Antoine Adelisse (born 10 June 1996) is a French freestyle skier.

From 1888 to 1916 he was Deputy Chairman of the Royal Irish Industries Association, which helped people working in cottage industries in Ireland. In 1890, Wood established a new illustrated paper for women, The Gentlewoman, which he managed.Douglas Brooke Wheelton Sladen, Twenty Years of My Life (1915), p. 201: \\"J. S. Wood, the founder and managing director of the Gentlewoman, and one of the real founders of the Primrose League, was often from the beginning at our at-homes, with his pretty Italian wife, and his daughters as they grew up. We used to meet them in the season at Ranelagh, too. Wood has been much more than a founder and editor of newspapers, for he has been connected with the management of several of our most important charities, and has himself been instrumental in raising a quarter of a million for them.\\" This became the focal point of Wood's publishing career, and The Gentlewoman was successful in attracting many well- known writers of the day.Truth, vol. 44 (1898), p. 261: \\"The Gentlewoman has gained for itself a reputation and position of stability which is without parallel in the history of any similar Journal, having regard to the number of years it has been established. Its high tone and artistic and literary excellence have made it a popular weekly newspaper.\\" At the very outset, he showed an innovative touch by serialising a novel in the paper's first twenty issues, unusual in two ways: not only was it written by readers of the paper, instead of professional writers, but a different reader wrote each chapter. In 1891 this notion was developed further when he commissioned a serial novel called \\"The Fate of Fenella\\",Edward Jewitt Wheeler, ed., Current Opinion, vol. 9 (1892), p. 156: \\"An amateur novel appeared in the first twenty numbers of the Gentlewoman, each chapter of which was written by a different reader of the magazine; this proved so successful as to suggest to the editor the scheme of having a novel by professionals conducted on the same plan; the result has been a work of fiction called The Fate of Fenella\\" for which twenty-four writers including Arthur Conan Doyle, Bram Stoker, and Mrs Trollope each produced one chapter \\"without any plan or collaboration\\".'Christmas Numbers' in The Times, issue 33508 dated 15 December 1891, p. 6: \\"the Gentlewoman has... the beginning of a novel, produced under exceptional conditions, \\"The Fate of Fenella\\".

Wood replied that her name had been left out intentionally, because of her own stated contempt for the press and her past objections to the snobbery of those who liked to appear in the \\"news puffs\\" of society events.

Born in County Clare, Ireland, she migrated to Australia as a child, growing up in Broken Hill, travelled widely and settled in Mosman, Sydney. She held more than two dozen patents ranging from a military barricade to a press stud that could be applied without stitching. ==Background== Myra and her family lived for a time in Bunratty Castle. Myra Farrell was born in Ireland on 25 February 1878 and was registered as Maria Julia, the third of six children of Marcus Frederick Welsh and Harriett Curtis (n√©e Dove) of Scragh House, County Clare. Farrell's family were Protestant, descendants of the Reverend George Studdert, chaplain to William III of England.Geraldton Guardian, Woman's Invention, Saturday 17 July 1915 (retrieved 22 February 2014) Many of her family were clergy, or military. They were major land-owners in County Clare, and many served as magistrates and as High Sheriff of Clare. Farrell's father travelled to New Zealand where he took part in the New Zealand Wars and married Harriett Curtis Dove, the daughter of an engineer. Marcus Welsh then returned to Ireland with his wife, to take up his estate at Kilrush. The destruction of the Scragh House by arson caused the family to flee to their Studdert relatives who provided a home for them for several years in the ruinous Bunratty Castle. In the 1880s the family migrated to Australia, where Farrell's mother, Harriett Welsh, had been born, and where one of Marcus Welsh's brothers was already living. They disembarked in Adelaide and travelled north to Broken Hill. Silver had recently been discovered to the west at Umberumberka. Marcus and Harriett established a school at the new town of Silverton and for a time had the author Mary Gilmore as their assistant. They then moved into Broken Hill and established St Peter's School, where Myra was educated. Harriett Welsh was particularly esteemed as a music teacher. Farrell's brothers remained in Broken Hill, while her sisters married and moved to Sydney and Perth.The Barrier Miner, Broken Hill, Obituary of Harriet Curtis Welsh, 18 July 1913, (retrieved 22 February 2014) ==InventionsMethod of working=== Farrell's earliest ideas for practical inventions came to her as a child when at the age of ten she came up with the idea of a self-locking safety pin. She later described her lifelong method of working, in a newspaper interview. Farrell would perceive a need for a particular product, would think about it, and sleep on it. Farrell claimed that in her dreams she would see the solution to the problem in great detail, including the way in which the object should be constructed. She would get out of bed and write down the details of construction, or the formula of a medication. She wrote on whatever was near to hand, including sometimes the bed-linen or the wall, and her somnambulant writing was always right to left, rather than left to right. In the morning, she would copy it out, with the aid of a mirror. She also drew all the detailed diagrams and created the models for submission for the patents process. ===Practical devices=== Farrell's first patent was for a tailoring device that enabled a small skirt pattern in a pattern book to be transferred directly to a piece of cloth. Her inventions included a number of practical household devices including a folding clothesline for use in flats. Her physical aids included a boneless corset for sufferers of scoliosis, a brace for hernias and a device that effected a facelift by simple mechanical means. Farrell also developed a sling for carrying a baby, at a time when these were not in common use in Western countries. According to the author Ruth Park, this device promoted the comment from Americans that Australian mothers had learnt from kangaroos to carry their babies in pouches. Inventions for rural industry included an automated fruit picker and packer, and a device for sampling and weighing wheat. Farrell also invented the press-stud that can be attached to a garment without stitching, and the folding pram hood. By 1915 Farrell had 24 patented inventions. ===Medications=== While living in Broken Hill, Farrell suffered acute respiratory problems. She dreamt of the formula of an inhalation of which the properties of the various ingredients had the effect of cutting mucous, reducing inflammation and promoting healing. She manufactured tablets to this formula, which were burnt in a clarifier and the fumes inhaled. Farrell then met William Taylor, a young man from Perthshire in Scotland, who had come to Australia suffering from tuberculosis. Farrell treated Taylor with her inhalant. He experienced a remarkable improvement, they were married in 1906, and he lived for another six years. Subsequently, the product was marketed as \\"Membrosus\\". Farrell also had great success with an ointment, known as \\"Myra's ointment\\", with which she successfully treated a women who contacted her, suffering from a rare fungal disease of the skin. ===Military aids=== During World War I Farrell worked on the invention of a barricade that could repel ammunition and lessen the impact of shells. The Australian Department of Defence took Farrell's plans for investigation, but whether the barricade was developed and utilised was not acknowledged. At about the same time, she developed a light that could be projected to a great distance. She initially saw its use as being for advertising purposes, but the military also took the plans and Farrell's prototype. The unconfirmed family legend is that the light was tested from the North Head of Sydney Harbour, causing confusion to the crew of a vessel out at sea who mistook the beam for that of the South Head lighthouse. ==Personal== Myra Farrell, then Taylor, was described in an article in the Western Age: Seascape painted by Myra Juliet Farrell in about 1938 Farrell married twice, firstly William Taylor with whom she had children Lavie Curtis Taylor and William Paterson Welsh Taylor, and secondly William George Farrell with whom she had a son, the violinist George Harry Welsh Farrell.The Sydney Morning Herald, Death Notice of William George Farrell, 1 Jan 1947, (retrieved 22 February 2014) After the death of her first husband in Adelaide, Farrell lived at various times in Western Australia and at Bondi in Sydney, spending her later life in Mosman. Aside from her inventions, Myra was a keen painter. Having learnt from an artist who painted stage scenery, she had a broad Impressionist style using intense colours and with little mixing of the paint. All her known remaining works are small landscapes. Farrell was known in Theosophical circles and subscribed to the building of a grandstand at Balmoral Beach to witness the arrival of Krishnamurti in Sydney. She financially supported the utopian William Lane in his enterprise to found an ideal colony in Paraguay. In this she argued at length with Mary Gilmore, who also supported William Lane but was scornful of Farrell's religious ideology. She was regarded as an eccentric, even within the family. Her eccentricities included keeping the foot of an Egyptian mummy on the mantelpiece, where it gathered dust because the housemaid refused to touch it. It was thrown out with the garbage and was subject to a police investigation when it was discovered by the garbage collector. Farrell died at her home at Mosman on 8 March 1957. ==Accolades== Myra Farrell was described in the Geraldton Guardian: The Western Age, Dubbo: ==References *Broken Hill Family History Group Category:1878 births Category:1957 deaths Category:19th-century Irish people Category:People from County Clare Category:People from Broken Hill, New South Wales Category:Australian inventors Category:Irish inventors Category:Irish emigrants to Australia (before 1923) Category:Women inventors Category:Australian women of World War I ","title":"Myra Juliet Farrell"},{"id":"42014821","text":"Gizem Saka (born April 9, 1978, Istanbul) is a contemporary Turkish artist and an economist.

North Melbourne and St Kilda were newly elevated from junior ranks to senior ranks for this season. Carlton, who were undefeated during the season, was considered the premier club, with Melbourne placed second, mostly by virtue of Carlton winning all four matches it played against Melbourne during the year. Melbourne was considered to have had the better record against the remaining clubs, because Carlton had recorded four draws against those other clubs, but such was Carlton and Melbourne's dominance at the time that the matches against the other clubs had little influence on the premiership. Carlton's record across all matches in 1874 was twelve wins and five draws from seventeen games; Melbourne's record was twelve wins, five losses and one draw from eighteen games. ===Club senior records=== The below table is set of results for senior clubs during the 1874 season.

Early Japanese began arriving around the time of the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. During World War II, Japanese-Americans opted to live in Chicago rather than be interned, primarily in camps on the Pacific Coast. In the 20th century, Japanese and Japanese Americans formed local institutions that continue into the 21st century. ==History== The first group of Japanese in Chicago arrived in 1892. They came as part of the Columbian Exposition so they could build the Ho-o-den Pavilion in Chicago.Murata, p. 7. In 1893 the first known Japanese individual in Chicago, Kamenosuke Nishi, moved to Chicago from San Francisco. He opened a gift store, and Masako Osako, author of \\"Japanese Americans: Melting into the All-American Melting Pot,\\" wrote that he was \\"said to have amassed $700,000 from the successful management\\" of his 27th Street and Cottage Grove location.Osako, p. 422. Some Japanese in Chicago operated businesses such as restaurants, gift shops, and housing units. Some Japanese came to study at universities in the Chicago area. In 1893 Eiji Asada completed a PhD at the University of Chicago. The pre-World War II Japanese population mostly lived in the Hyde Park/Kenwood/Woodlawn region.Cutler, Irving. Chicago, Metropolis of the Mid-continent. SIU Press, 2006. , 9780809387953. p. 189. Many of the Japanese were students of the University of Chicago or had graduated from that school.Cutler, Irving. Chicago, Metropolis of the Mid-continent. SIU Press, 2006. , 9780809387953. p. 190. Irving Cutler, author of Chicago, Metropolis of the Mid-continent, wrote that in that period, compared to the West Coast, Chicago had little discrimination against the Japanese. In 1927 there were 300 Japanese Americans in Chicago. In 1940 there were 390 Japanese Americans in Chicago. Osako characterized the pre-World War II growth of the Japanese- American community as being slow. ===World War II=== During World War II, the first field office of the War Relocation Authority (WRA) opened in Chicago and the city invited Japanese leaving the Japanese internment camps. The first wave of Japanese Americans from the internment camps arrived on June 12, 1942.Osako, p. 423. During the war, the number of ethnic Japanese increased to 20,000. Unlike on the west coast, the Japanese had freedom of movement and could work. Japanese worked in factories making materials to support the war, including aircraft and electronics.Hurd, p. 142. They were often placed in areas in between white and black neighborhoods, including Lake View, the Near North Side, Oakland, North Kenwood, and Woodlawn. The Japanese Americans in Chicago largely relied on each other and avoided support from civic organizations, church organizations, and the WRA.Brooks, \\"In the Twilight Zone between Black and White: Japanese American Resettlement and Community in Chicago, 1942-1945,\\" p. 1657 Charlotte Brooks, author of \\"In the Twilight Zone between Black and White: Japanese American Resettlement and Community in Chicago, 1942-1945,\\" wrote that Chicagoans did not perceive the Japanese- Americans as being \\"Japanese\\", but rather as non-White,Brooks, \\"In the Twilight Zone between Black and White: Japanese American Resettlement and Community in Chicago, 1942-1945,\\" p. 1655 and being \\"Orientals\\" but not black.Brooks, \\"In the Twilight Zone between Black and White: Japanese American Resettlement and Community in Chicago, 1942-1945,\\" p. 1656 She stated that Chicagoans, accustomed to living in a city with predominately Whites of a superior status and blacks with an inferior status, had difficulty classifying Japanese in their racial structure. She added that the discrimination against the Japanese mainly came because they were non-White, not because they were Japanese. Some anti-Japanese violence occurred, including the destruction of windows of a Japanese gift shop. During that period Chicago-area Chinese and Filipinos stressed that they were not Japanese. The Japanese of the era had a tendency to gravitate towards the White world and away from the black world, understanding that blacks in Chicago had an inferior status. Ultimately 30,000 Japanese had moved from the internment camps to Chicago. ===Post-World War II=== After World War II ended, many Japanese who had originated from the internment camps returned to the West Coast, so the Japanese population decreased. The influx of Japanese ended in 1950. Almost half of the Japanese who had settled in Chicago from the internment camps moved back to the West Coast. By 1960, there were about 15,000 Japanese in Chicago and the resettlement to the West Coast largely ceased. In 1981, public hearings were held by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians at Chicago's Northeastern Illinois University as part of a government investigation into the constitutionality of the World War II internment of Japanese Americans. Nearly 100 people participated in the Chicago hearings. A 1993 article called \\"Racial Change to the Suburbs\\" quoted Japanese Americans as being experts on the Asian Americans moving to the suburbs. Jacalyn D. Harden, author of Double Cross: Japanese Americans in Black and White Chicago, wrote that it was \\"seen by many\\" as \\"privileging\\" the \\"Japanese Americans over other Asian groups.\\"Harden, p. 162-163. By 1995 Japanese Americans began moving to the suburbs. Most of them were white collar households who had higher incomes and better educations who wish to find superior schools for their offspring. As of 1995, about 25% of the Japanese American households are in the suburbs. As a result, Osako stated that the next generations of Nisei in the Chicago area will have less contact with the wider Japanese American community in the central city than before.Osako, p. 431. As of 2006 there is a high intermarriage rate among the Japanese, and there is a large amount of assimilation into the larger American community. ==Geography== As of the 2000 U.S. Census, 5,500 people of Japanese descent lived in the city of Chicago, and 17,500 people of Japanese descent lived in Chicago suburbs such as Arlington Heights, Evanston, Hoffman Estates, Lincolnwood, and Skokie. Most Japanese within the City of Chicago live in lakefront areas in the North Side, including Edgewater, Lake View, Near North Side, Uptown, and West Ridge.

It was led by Matteo Renzi, secretary and leader of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD). The government was composed of members of the PD together with the New Centre-Right (NCD), the Union of the Centre (UdC), Civic Choice (SC), the Populars for Italy (PpI, until June 2015), Solidary Democracy (Demo.S, since July 2014), the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), Democratic Centre (CD, since October 2015) and non-party independents. At its formation, the Renzi Cabinet was the youngest government of Italy to date, with an average age of forty-seven, and the youngest-ever Prime Minister. It was also the first Italian cabinet in which the number of female ministers was equal to the number of male ministers, not including the prime minister. That later changed, as eventually three female ministers resigned, each replaced by a male minister. On 19 April 2016 the Senate rejected two motions of no confidence against the government, following the \\"Tempa Rossa scandal\\": the first one (entered by the Five Star Movement) was defeated with a 96‚Äì183 votes, the second one (entered by Forza Italia, Northern League and Conservative and Reformists) was also defeated with a 93‚Äì180 vote. ==History== Renzi's government during the oath. At a meeting on 13 February 2014, following tensions between Prime Minister Enrico Letta and PD Secretary Matteo Renzi, the Democratic Party leadership voted heavily in favour of Renzi's call for \\"a new government, a new phase and a radical programme of reform\\". Minutes after the Party backed the Renzi proposal by 136 votes to 16, with two abstentions, Palazzo Chigi ‚Äì the official residence of the Prime Minister ‚Äì announced that Letta would travel to the Quirinale the following day to tender his resignation to President Giorgio Napolitano. In an earlier speech, Renzi had paid tribute to Letta, saying that he was not intended to put him \\"on trial\\". But, without directly proposing himself as the next Prime Minister, he said the Eurozone's third-largest economy urgently needed \\"a new phase\\" and \\"radical programme\\" to push through badly-needed reforms. The motion he put forward made clear \\"the necessity and urgency of opening a new phase with a new executive\\". Speaking privately to party leaders, Renzi said that Italy was \\"at a crossroads\\" and faced either holding fresh elections or a new government without a return to the polls. On 14 February, President Napolitano accepted Letta's resignation from the office of Prime Minister. Following Letta's resignation, Renzi formally received the task of forming a new government from President Napolitano on 17 February. Renzi held several days of talks with party leaders, all of which he broadcast live on the internet, before unveiling his cabinet on 21 February, which contained members of his Democratic Party, the New Centre-Right, the Union of the Centre and Civic Choice. His Cabinet became Italy's youngest government to date, with an average age of 47. It was also the first in which the number of female ministers was equal to the number of male ministers, excluding the Prime Minister. The following day Renzi was formally sworn in as Prime Minister, becoming the youngest Prime Minister in the history of Italy. His rise to become Prime Minister was widely seen as a sign of much-needed generational change, and at the time he took office he enjoyed by far the highest approval rating of any politician in the country. On 25 February Renzi won a vote of confidence in the Italian Parliament, with 169 votes in the Senate and 378 in the Chamber of Deputies. On 20 March 2015, Prime Minister Renzi became ad interim Minister of Infrastructure and Transport after the resignation of Maurizio Lupi, due to a corruption scandal involving public works on infrastructure, in which his name was cited several times. Renzi hold the office until 2 April, when Graziano Delrio was appointed as new minister. ==Investiture votes== {  style=\\"font-size:85%;\\" - ! colspan=\\"4\\" 24‚Äì25 February 2014 Investiture votes for Renzi Cabinet - ! width=\\"120\\"  House of Parliament ! width=\\"60\\"  Vote ! width=\\"300\\"  Parties ! width=\\"80\\" align=\\"center\\"  Votes - ! rowspan=\\"3\\" Senate of the Republic  YesPD (107), NCD (31), PSI-SVP (11), PI (11), SC (8), GAL‚ÄìUDC (1) -  NoFI (58), M5S (49), LN (14), GAL‚ÄìUDC (10), Others (8)  - AbstentionNone  - ! rowspan=\\"3\\" Chamber of Deputies  YesPD (290), NCD (29), SC (22), Demo.S‚ÄìCD (17), LN (1), Others (19) -  NoM5S (98), FI (61), SEL (34), LN (18), FdI (7), Others (2)  - AbstentionOthers (1)  } ==Party breakdownBeginning of term=== Ministers { -  * Democratic Party  9 -  * New Centre-Right  3 -  * Civic Choice  1 -  * Union of the Centre  1 -  * Independents  3 } Ministers and other members * Democratic Party (PD): Prime minister, 8 ministers, 4 deputy ministers, 21 undersecretaries * New Centre- Right (NCD): 3 ministers, 2 deputy ministers, 7 undersecretaries * Civic Choice (SC): 1 minister, 1 deputy minister, 3 undersecretaries * Union of the Centre (UdC): 1 minister * Populars for Italy (PpI): 1 deputy minister, 3 undersecretaries * Italian Socialist Party (PSI): 1 deputy minister * Independents: 3 ministers, 5 undersecretaries ===End of term=== Ministers { -  * Democratic Party  10 -  * New Centre-Right  3 -  * Union of the Centre  1 -  * Independents  3 } Ministers and other members * Democratic Party (PD): Prime minister, 9 ministers, 3 deputy ministers, 23 undersecretaries * New Centre- Right (NCD): 3 ministers, 1 deputy minister, 9 undersecretaries * Union of the Centre (UdC): 1 minister * Solidary Democracy (Demo.S): 2 deputy ministers * Civic Choice (SC): 1 deputy minister * Italian Socialist Party (PSI): 1 deputy minister * Democratic Centre (CD): 1 undersecretary * Civics and Innovators (CI): 1 undersecretary * Independents: 3 ministers, 1 deputy minister, 4 undersecretaries ==Geographical breakdownBeginning of term=== * Northern Italy: 8 ministers ** Emilia-Romagna: 4 ministers ** Lombardy: 2 ministers ** Liguria: 2 ministers * Central Italy: 7 ministers (incl.

Having lost their mother when Margaret was eight years old, and their father having met with business reverses, she and her older sister, Mary (1800-1870), were placed under the care of their uncle, Adam Gillies, Lord Gillies. They were educated by him, and then introduced to Edinburgh society. Before she was twenty, Gillies decided to earn her own living, and returned with her sister to her father's home in London. Mary Gillies became an author, while Margaret took the direction of a professional artist. She received lessons in miniature-painting from Frederick Cruikshank, and gained a reputation for it. Cruikshank's style was based on that of Andrew Robertson. In the early 1830s Southwood Smith, physician, Unitarian and a pioneer in the improvement of the health of the poor, particularly in London, separated from his second wife, Mary, and went to live with Gillies and her sister Mary. The 1841 census records Margarett Gillies as aged 35 living at Hortet's Terrace, St.Pancras with Thomas Smith aged 50, Gertrude Hill aged 3, Harriet Lebe 21 and Sarah Hargrove 15. Smith and Gillies lived together in Highgate from 1844. Smith, an ordained Unitarian minister, and Gillies associated with the group around the Monthly Repository, a Unitarian periodical; Mary Gillies was involved in editing it from 1836. Margaret Gillies illustrated in 1842 Smith's first report as a mines inspector, on a tour in Leicestershire and West Yorkshire.Darley, Gillian.

Around 1850 Gillies was at 36 Percy Street, and was housing the \\"auto-icon\\" of Jeremy Bentham, on whose cadaver Southwood Smith had conducted a highly controversial public dissection in 1832. She went in 1851 to Paris for a year, where she worked in the studios of Hendrik and Ary Scheffer, and on her return to England she exhibited some portraits in oils. She then concentrated on watercolour painting, typically choosing domestic, romantic, or sentimental subjects, for which she was best known. She joined the Society of Female Artists in 1856. In 1854, short of money, they had moved to The Pines, near Weybridge. The 1861 census records Mary Gillies 60, authoress and Margaret Gillies 56, Artist in Water Colours, living at Heath House, Weybridge with Thomas S Smith, 72, physician and widower, his son Herman Smith 40, Wine merchant, his granddaughter Gertrude Hill 23, lady, and also a cook and servant. Thomas Smith died in 1861. Gillies lived for many years in Church Row, Hampstead. She died at The Warren, Crockham Hill, Kent, on 20 July 1887, of pleurisy, after a few days' illness. Among her pupils was Marian Emma Chase, and she gave early encouragement to Anna Mary Howitt. ==Works== Charles Dickens, portrait by Margaret Gillies, 1843 Before she was 24, Gillies was commissioned to paint a miniature of William Wordsworth, and stayed at Rydal Mount for several weeks. She has three oil paintings in British national collections‚Äîin Aberystwyth, Nottingham and the National Portrait Gallery. Pamela Gerrish Nunn wrote that she \\"combined an early-Victorian aesthetic with a mid-Victorian independence of mind\\".Pamela Gerrish Nunn, Between Strong-Mindedness and Sentimentality: Women's Literary Painting, Victorian Poetry Vol. 33, No. 3/4, Word and Image (Autumn - Winter, 1995), pp. 425-447 at p. 437. Published by: West Virginia University Press. ===Portrait artist=== During the 1830s and 1840s Gillies was a career portrait artist, and for many successive years contributed portraits to the exhibitions of the Royal Academy. Her subjects included feminist figures: Mary Leman Grimstone, Mary Howitt and her daughter Anna Mary Howitt, Harriet Martineau of the Monthly Repository group. She also painted Anne Marsh the novelist. Her portrait of Charles Dickens, painted during the period when he was writing A Christmas Carol, was in the Royal Academy of Arts' 1844 summer exhibition. After viewing it there, Elizabeth Barrett Browning said that it showed Dickens with \\"the dust and mud of humanity about him, notwithstanding those eagle eyes\\". A simplified form was used as the frontispiece of a book, A New Spirit of the Age, in the same year. The painting's location was unknown, from later in Gillies' lifetime, when she was unable to trace it, until it was rediscovered in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, and acquired and restored by the art dealer Philip Mould in 2018. ===Watercolourist=== In 1852 Gillies was elected an associate of the Old Society of Painters in Water Colours, and was a contributor to its exhibitions for the rest of her life. Her exhibited works included: * Past and Future, 1855, and The Heavens are telling, 1856, both of which were engraved * Rosalind and Celia, 1857 * Una and the Red Cross Knight in the Cavern of Despair, An Eastern Mother, and Vivia Perpetua in Prison, 1858 * A Father and Daughter, 1859 * Imogen after the Departure of Posthumus, 1860 * Beyond, 1861 * The Wanderer, 1868 * Prospero and Miranda, 1874 * Cercando Pace, a drawing in three compartments, 1875 * The Pilgrimage, exhibited at the Royal Jubilee Exhibition at Manchester in 1887 Her last work was Christiana by the River of Life, exhibited in 1887. ==Notes== ;Attribution ==External links== * Category:Portrait miniaturists Category:Scottish watercolourists Category:1803 births Category:1887 deaths Category:Scottish portrait painters Category:Scottish women painters Category:Women watercolorists Category:19th-century Scottish painters Category:19th-century British women artists ","title":"Margaret Gillies"},{"id":"42015026","text":"John Landells (11 November 1904 ‚Äì 1986) was an English footballer who played as a forward.

Notable for its absence was the South Yarra Football Club; after being a powerhouse of the 1860s, the club folded in January 1873. Many of its players went to the nearly and newly established junior St Kilda Football Club, which was elevated to senior ranks in 1874. Carlton and Melbourne were considered the dominant clubs in the city, so the premier club was decided based entirely on the head-to-head record between the clubs; in their four meetings, Carlton won two and two were drawn, so Carlton was recognised as the premier club for the season. ===Club senior records=== The below table is set of results for senior clubs during the 1873 season.

She was arrested on 21 September 1940 in Prague, Po≈ô√≠ƒç√≠ Street, with false documents. During the interrogation, she tried to accept all the blame herself and saved a number of other resistance members. Still, members of her family were arrested - her husband died in the Buchenwald concentration camp, her father in the concentration camp in Dachau. Bern√°≈°kov√° was the first Czech woman convicted and sentenced to death by the Nazis. She was sentenced on 5 March 1942, and then guillotined at the end of August 1942 in Pl√∂tzensee Prison, Berlin. ==Aftermath== In 1946, she was awarded the Czechoslovak War Cross, in memoriam.

It broadcasts on 107.3 FM and online. The station was one of two to apply in 2014 for an FM community radio licence to cover Stafford. The other was BFBS.http://radiotoday.co.uk/2014/07/27-community- applications-for-the-midlands/ Radio Today  27 community applications for the Midlands On 3 October 2014, Ofcom announced that both applications had been successful and that 5-year full-time licences will be awarded.http://media.ofcom.org.uk/news/2014/community-radio-awards-sep14/ Ofcom awards new community radio licences in Staffordshire == History  1990s === There have been a number of volunteer-run radio broadcasting projects in the area at intervals over nearly 20 years, and many of the volunteers have taken part in several of them. An experimental project called the Stafford Broadcasting Society, organised by the late Robert Leighton (an electronics engineer and part-time presenter on Radio Caroline) carried out a restricted service licence (RSL) broadcast in the mid-1990s, using a transmitter near Hopton. === 2001-2003 === Stafford FM was first set up in 2001 by broadcast engineer Richard Lamont and local broadcaster Ray Crowther to do 28-day RSL FM trials, serving Stafford and the surrounding area from studios in Gaol Mews and a transmitter near Hopton. It aimed to gain a permanent small-scale commercial radio licence from the then regulator, the Radio Authority. A total of four RSLs at six-month intervals were carried out between 2001 and 2003. By then the Radio Authority had been replaced by Ofcom, which announced that no more small-scale commercial radio licences were going to be handed out, so the project was put on ice indefinitely. Between 2003 and 2012, Super Radio was operated by Steve Rowney and Ray Crowther. Broadcasting by streaming on the internet, the station kept local radio in Stafford going. === 2011-2012 === Stafford FM re-emerged as a community station in 2011, launching online.http://radiotoday.co.uk/2011/08/former-signal-staff-revamp- stafford-fm/ Radio Today  Former Signal staff revamp Stafford FM At the time, the station was based in studios on Marston Road, Stafford. While at the Marston Road studios, the station held three RSL licences, using a transmitter at the same Hopton site as the earlier project. This was in an attempt to gain a community radio licence for the town. === XL FM === After a falling out with the owners of the studio building in December 2012, Stafford FM went off air for a time, until, on Sunday 3 February 2013, the station re-launched as XL FM.http://radiotoday.co.uk/2013/01/stafford-station-re-structures-for-2013/ Radio Today  Stafford station re-structures for 2013 This was branded under a re-structuring, and the station promised a variety of shows and a wide range of music. However, it was announced on 19 August 2013 that the station would revert to its original name.http://www.staffordshirenewsletter.co.uk/XL-FM- reverts-original-Stafford-FM/story-20158361-detail/story.html XL FM reverts to original Stafford FM name  Staffs Newsletter == Stafford FM now == Stafford FM broadcast its eighth and final FM trail (RSL) for 28 days from Monday 31 March 2014 on 87.7 FM, using a transmitter at Mount Street in the town centre. After being awarded a full-time community FM licence from ofcom in October 2014, the station commenced full-time broadcasting on 107.3 FM at noon on Saturday 25 April 2015. Ray Crowther presented a special 2 hour launch programme after selecting Neil Diamond's \\"Beautiful Noise\\" as its first track. Stafford FM broadcast from its studio's in Mount Street, near to Stafford Market until April 2017 when the station re-located within the town centre to a new broadcast centre with three studios and additional facilities . As well as the mainstream daytime programming, the station carries specialist programming during the evening, and covers local sport, including reports on Stafford Rangers FC, Brocton FC and Stafford Town FC. It is funded by advertising, sponsorship, grants and donations. The station is structured as a company limited by guarantee and is run by the board of directors who are all volunteers. == Steering Group == Stafford FM has a steering group and a listener panel. == Current daytime line up == *Stafford's Own Breakfast Show - 06:30 - 10:00 *The Mid Morning Show - 10:00 - 14:00 *Drive Time - 14:00 - 18:00 As well as the daytime shows, the station broadcasts specialist programming during the evening and weekends. ==References  *www.staffordfm.co.uk * www.media.info/radio/stations/stafford-fm Category:2011 establishments in England Category:Community radio stations in the United Kingdom Category:Radio stations established in 2011 Category:Radio stations in Staffordshire Category:Stafford ","title":"Stafford FM"},{"id":"42015096","text":"Mesorhizobium alhagi is a gram-negative, aerobic non-spore-forming, motile bacteria from the genus of Mesorhizobium which was isolated from wild Alhagi sparsifolia in north-western China.Taxonomy Browser == References  *Type strain of Mesorhizobium alhagi at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Phyllobacteriaceae Category:Bacteria described in 2010 ","title":"Mesorhizobium alhagi"},{"id":"42015113","text":"The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA; (, BARJAM)), known commonly as the Iran nuclear deal or Iran deal, is an agreement on the Iranian nuclear program reached in Vienna on 14 July 2015, between Iran and the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council‚ÄîChina, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States‚Äîplus Germany) together with the European Union. Formal negotiations toward JCPOA began with the adoption of the Joint Plan of Action, an interim agreement signed between Iran and the P5+1 countries in November 2013. Iran and the P5+1 countries engaged in negotiations for the next 20 months and in April 2015 agreed on a framework for the final agreement. In July 2015 Iran and the P5+1 confirmed agreement on the plan along with the \\"Roadmap Agreement\\" between Iran and the IAEA. == Timeline == Under JCPOA, Iran agreed to eliminate its stockpile of medium- enriched uranium, cut its stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98%, and reduce by about two-thirds the number of its gas centrifuges for 13 years. For the next 15 years Iran will only enrich uranium up to 3.67%. Iran also agreed not to build any new heavy-water facilities for the same period of time. Uranium- enrichment activities will be limited to a single facility using first- generation centrifuges for 10 years. Other facilities will be converted to avoid proliferation risks. To monitor and verify Iran's compliance with the agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will have regular access to all Iranian nuclear facilities. The agreement provides that in return for verifiably abiding by its commitments, Iran will receive relief from U.S., European Union, and United Nations Security Council nuclear-related sanctions. On 12 October 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the United States would not make the certification provided for under U.S. domestic law, but stopped short of terminating the deal. IAEA inspectors spend 3,000 calendar days per year in Iran, installing tamper-proof seals and collecting surveillance camera photos, measurement data and documents for further analysis. IAEA Director Yukiya Amano stated (in March 2018) that the organization has verified that Iran is implementing its nuclear-related commitments.Amano, Yukia (5 March 2018). \\"IAEA director general: Introductory remarks at press conference\\", International Atomic Energy Agency On 30 April 2018 the United States and Israel said that Iran had not disclosed a past covert nuclear weapons program to the IAEA, as required by the 2015 deal. On 8 May 2018, Trump announced United States withdrawal from JCPOA. Following the U.S.'s withdrawal, the EU enacted an updated blocking statute on 7 August 2018 to nullify US sanctions on countries trading with Iran. In November 2018 U.S. sanctions came back into effect intended to force Iran to dramatically alter its policies, including its support for militant groups in the region and its development of ballistic missiles. In May 2019, the IAEA certified that Iran was abiding by the main terms of the deal, though questions were raised about how many advanced centrifuges Iran was allowed to have, as that was only loosely defined in the deal. On 1 July 2019, Iran announced that it had breached the limit set on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium, which the IAEA confirmed. On 5 January 2020, in the aftermath of the Baghdad Airport Airstrike that targeted and killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, Iran declared that it would no longer abide by the limitations of the deal but would continue to coordinate with the IAEA, leaving open the possibility of resuming compliance. ==Background Nuclear technology === A nuclear weapon uses a fissile material to cause a nuclear chain reaction. The most commonly used materials have been uranium 235 (U-235) and plutonium 239 (Pu-239). Both uranium 233 (U-233) and reactor-grade plutonium have also been used. The amount of uranium or plutonium needed depends on the sophistication of the design, with a simple design requiring approximately 15 kg of uranium or 6 kg of plutonium, and a sophisticated design requiring as little as 9 kg of uranium or 2 kg of plutonium. Plutonium is almost nonexistent in nature, and natural uranium is about 99.3% uranium 238 (U-238) and 0.7% U-235. Therefore, to make a weapon, either uranium must be enriched, or plutonium must be produced. Uranium enrichment is also frequently necessary for nuclear power. For this reason, uranium enrichment is a dual-use technology, a technology which \\"can be used both for civilian and for military purposes\\". Key strategies to prevent proliferation of nuclear arms include limiting the number of operating uranium enrichment plants and controlling the export of nuclear technology and fissile material. === Iranian nuclear activity, conflict with IAEA and Western countries, 1970‚Äì2006 === Iranian development of nuclear technology began in the 1970s, when the U.S. Atoms for Peace program began providing assistance to Iran, which was then led by the Shah.\\"Country Profiles: Iran: Nuclear\\" , Nuclear Threat Initiative (last updated July 2015). Iran signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1968 as a non-nuclear weapons state and ratified the NPT in 1970. In 1979 the Iranian Revolution took place, and Iran's nuclear program, which had developed some baseline capacity, fell to disarray as \\"much of Iran's nuclear talent fled the country in the wake of the Revolution.\\" Furthermore, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was initially opposed to nuclear technology, and Iran engaged in a costly war with Iraq from 1980 to 1988. In the late 1980s Iran reinstated its nuclear program, with assistance from Pakistan (which entered into a bilateral agreement with Iran in 1992), China (which did the same in 1990), and Russia (which did the same in 1992 and 1995), and from the A.Q. Khan network. Iran \\"began pursuing an indigenous nuclear fuel cycle capability by developing a uranium mining infrastructure and experimenting with uranium conversion and enrichment\\". In August 2002 the Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran, an Iranian dissident group, publicly revealed the existence of two undeclared nuclear facilities, the Arak heavy-water production facility and the Natanz enrichment facility.\\"Iran nuclear talks: timeline\\", The Guardian (14 July 2015). In February 2003 Iranian President Mohammad Khatami acknowledged the existence of the facilities and asserted that Iran had undertaken \\"small-scale enrichment experiments\\" to produce low- enriched uranium for nuclear power plants. In late February International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors visited Natanz. In May 2003 Iran allowed IAEA inspectors to visit the Kalaye Electric Company but refused to allow them to take samples. In June 2003, an IAEA report concluded that Iran had failed to meet its obligations under the safeguards agreement, and Iran, faced with the prospect of being referred to the UN Security Council, entered into diplomatic negotiations with France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (the EU 3). The United States refused to be involved in these negotiations. In October 2003 the Tehran Declaration was reached between Iran and the EU 3; under this declaration Iran agreed to cooperate fully with the IAEA, sign the Additional Protocol, and temporarily suspend all uranium enrichment. In September and October 2003 the IAEA conducted several facility inspections. This was followed by the Paris Agreement in November 2004, in which Iran agreed to temporarily suspend enrichment and conversion activities, \\"including the manufacture, installation, testing, and operation of centrifuges, and committed to working with the EU-3 to find a mutually beneficial long-term diplomatic solution\\". In August 2005, the newly elected president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, promptly accused Iranian negotiators who had negotiated the Paris Accords of treason. Over the next two months, the EU 3 agreement fell apart as talks over the EU 3's proposed Long Term Agreement broke down; the Iranian government \\"felt that the proposal was heavy on demands, light on incentives, did not incorporate Iran's proposals, and violated the Paris Agreement\\". Iran notified the IAEA that it would resume uranium conversion at Esfahan. In February 2006 Iran ended its voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol and resumed enrichment at Natanz, prompting the IAEA Board of Governors to refer Iran to the UN Security Council. After the vote, Iran announced it would resume enrichment of uranium. In April 2006 Ahmadinejad announced that Iran had nuclear technology but said that it was purely for power generation, not weapons. In June 2006 the EU 3 joined China, Russia, and the United States, to form the P5+1. The following month, July 2006, the UN Security Council passed its first resolution (nr. 1696), demanding Iran stop uranium enrichment and processing, because of \\"serious concern\\" about \\"a number of outstanding issues and concerns on Iran's nuclear programme, including topics which could have a military nuclear dimension\\". Another UN Security Council resolution followed in December 2006 (nr. 1737); others followed later. The legal authority for the IAEA Board of Governors referral and the Security Council resolutions derived from the IAEA Statute and the United Nations Charter. The resolutions demanded that Iran cease enrichment activities, and the second resolution (Dec. 2006) also imposed sanctions on Iran, including bans on the transfer of nuclear and missile technology to the country and freezes on the assets of certain Iranian individuals and entities, in order to pressure the country. In July 2006 Iran opened the Arak heavy water production plant, which led to one of the Security Council resolutions. === Prolonged conflict Iran with U.S. and European countries, 2007‚Äìpresent === Four more UN Security Council resolutions concerning Iran's nuclear program followed: 1747 (March 2007), 1803 (March 2008), 1835 (September 2008), and 1929 (June 2010). In Resolution 1803 and elsewhere the Security Council acknowledged Iran's rights under Article IV of the NPT, which provides for \\"the inalienable right ... to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes\\".Paul K. Kerry, \\"Iran's Nuclear Program: Tehran's Compliance with International Obligations\\", Congressional Research Service (25 June 2015). In a February 2007 interview with the Financial Times, IAEA director general Mohamed ElBaradei said that military action against Iran \\"would be catastrophic, counterproductive\\" and called for negotiations between the international community and Iran over the Iranian nuclear program.Daniel Dombey, Transcript of the Director General's Interview on Iran and DPRK, Financial Times (19 February 2007). ElBaradei specifically proposed a \\"double, simultaneous suspension, a time out\\" as \\"a confidence-building measure\\", under which the international sanctions would be suspended and Iran would suspend enrichment. ElBaradei also said, \\"if I look at it from a weapons perspective there are much more important issues to me than the suspension of [enrichment],\\" naming his top priorities as preventing Iran from \\"go[ing] to industrial capacity until the issues are settled\\"; building confidence, with \\"full inspection\\" involving Iranian adoption of the Additional Protocol; and \\"at all costs\\" preventing Iran from \\"moving out of the [treaty-based non- proliferation] system\\". A November 2007 U.S. National Intelligence Estimate assessed that Iran \\"halted its nuclear weapons program\\" in 2003; that estimate and subsequent U.S. Intelligence Community statements also assessed that the Iranian government at the time had was \\"keeping open the 'option' to develop nuclear weapons\\" in the future.Kenneth Katzman & Paul K. Kerr, \\"Report: Iran Nuclear Agreement\\", Congressional Research Service (30 July 2015). In September 2009 U.S. President Barack Obama revealed the existence of an underground enrichment facility in Fordow, near Qom, saying, \\"Iran's decision to build yet another nuclear facility without notifying the IAEA represents a direct challenge to the basic compact at the center of the non-proliferation regime.\\" Israel threatened to take military action against Iran. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry shakes hands with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif after the P5+1 and Iran concluded negotiations about Iran's nuclear capabilities on November 24, 2013 In March 2013 the United States began a series of secret bilateral talks with Iranian officials in Oman, led by William Joseph Burns and Jake Sullivan on the American side and Ali Asghar Khaji on the Iranian side.Laura Rozen, \\"Three days in March: New details on how US, Iran opened direct talks\\", Al-Monitor (8 January 2014). In June 2013 Hassan Rouhani was elected president of Iran. Rouhani has been described as \\"more moderate, pragmatic and willing to negotiate than Ahmadinejad\\". But in a 2006 nuclear negotiation with European powers, Rouhani said that Iran had used the negotiations to dupe the Europeans, saying that during the negotiations, Iran managed to master the conversion of uranium yellowcake at Isfahan. The conversion of yellowcake is an important step in the nuclear fuel process. In August 2013, three days after his inauguration, Rouhani called for a resumption of serious negotiations with the P5+1 on the Iranian nuclear program.\\"Timeline of Nuclear Diplomacy With Iran\\", Arms Control Association (July 2015). In September 2013 Obama and Rouhani spoke by telephone, the first high-level contact between U.S. and Iranian leaders since 1979, and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, signaling that the two countries were open to cooperation. Former officials alleged that, in order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded Hezbollah from the Drug Enforcement Administration's Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the Central Intelligence Agency.Obama Administration Reportedly Shielded Hezbollah From DEA and CIA to Save Iran Nuclear Deal, Haaretz, 18 December 2017A Global Threat Emerges, Politico, 18 December 2017 As a result of the Politico report, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered an investigation to determine the veracity of the allegations. After several rounds of negotiations, on 24 November 2013 the Joint Plan of Action, an interim agreement on the Iranian nuclear program, was signed between Iran and the P5+1 countries in Geneva, Switzerland. It consisted of a short-term freeze of portions of Iran's nuclear program in exchange for decreased economic sanctions on Iran, as the countries work towards a long-term agreement. The IAEA began \\"more intrusive and frequent inspections\\" under this interim agreement. The agreement was formally activated on 20 January 2014. On that day, the IAEA issued a report stating that Iran was adhering to the terms of the interim agreement, including stopping enrichment of uranium to 20 percent, beginning the dilution process (to reduce half of the stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium to 3.5 percent), and halting work on the Arak heavy-water reactor. A major focus on the negotiations was limitations on Iran's key nuclear facilities: the Arak IR-40 heavy water reactor and production plant (which was under construction, but never became operational, as Iran agreed as part of the November 2013 Joint Plan of Action (interim agreement) not to commission or fuel the reactor); the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant; the Gachin uranium mine; the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant; the Isfahan uranium-conversion plant; the Natanz uranium enrichment plant; and the Parchin military research and development complex.\\"Iran's key nuclear sites\\", BBC News (14 July 2015). A July 2015 Congressional Research Service report said, \\"statements from the U.S. intelligence community indicate that Iran has the technological and industrial capacity to produce nuclear weapons at some point, but the U.S. government assesses that Tehran has not mastered all of the necessary technologies for building a nuclear weapon.\\" ==Negotiations== Foreign Ministers from the P5+1 nations, the European Union, and Iran in Vienna, Austria, on November 24, 2014 The agreement between the P5+1+EU and Iran on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is the culmination of 20 months of \\"arduous\\" negotiations.Jethro Mullen & Nic Robertson, \\"Landmark deal reached on Iran nuclear program\\", CNN (14 July 2015).Michael R. Gordon & David E. Sanger, \\"Deal Reached on Iran Nuclear Program; Limits on Fuel Would Lessen With Time\\", The New York Times (14 July 2015). The agreement followed the Joint Plan of Action (JPA), an interim agreement between the P5+1 powers and Iran that was agreed to on 24 November 2013 at Geneva. The Geneva agreement was an interim deal,\\"Iran, world powers reach historic nuclear deal\\", The Washington Post in which Iran agreed to roll back parts of its nuclear program in exchange for relief from some sanctions. This went into effect on 20 January 2014. The parties agreed to extend their talks with a first extension deadline on 24 November 2014 and a second extension deadline set to 1 July 2015. An Iran nuclear deal framework was reached on 2 April 2015. Under this framework Iran agreed tentatively to accept restrictions on its nuclear program, all of which would last for at least a decade and some longer, and to submit to an increased intensity of international inspections under a framework deal. These details were to be negotiated by the end of June 2015. The negotiations toward a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action were extended several times until the final agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was finally reached on 14 July 2015. The JCPOA is based on the framework agreement from three months earlier. Subsequently the negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 continued. In April 2015 a framework deal was reached at Lausanne. Intense marathon negotiations then continued, with the last session in Vienna at the Palais Coburg lasting for seventeen days.Karen DeYoung & Carol Morello, \\"The path to a final Iran nuclear deal: Long days and short tempers\\", The Washington Post (15 July 2015). At several points, negotiations appeared to be at risk of breaking down, but negotiators managed to come to agreement. As the negotiators neared a deal, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry directly asked Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to confirm that he was \\"authorized to actually make a deal, not just by the [Iranian] president, but by the supreme leader?\\" Zarif gave assurances that he was. Ultimately, on 14 July 2015 all parties agreed to a landmark comprehensive nuclear agreement. At the time of the announcement, shortly before 11:00 GMT, the agreement was released to the public. The final agreement's complexity shows the impact of a public letter written by a bipartisan group of 19 U.S. diplomats, experts, and others in June 2015, written when negotiations were still going on.\\"Public Statement on U.S. Policy Toward the Iran Nuclear Negotiations Endorsed by a Bipartisan Group of American Diplomats, Legislators, Policymakers, and Experts\\", Washington Institute for Near East Policy (24 June 2015). That letter outlined concerns about the several provisions in the then-unfinished agreement and called for a number of improvements to strengthen the prospective agreement and win their support for it. After the final agreement was reached, one of the early negotiators, Robert J. Einhorn, a former U.S. Department of State official now at the Brookings Institution, said of the agreement: \\"Analysts will be pleasantly surprised. The more things are agreed to, the less opportunity there is for implementation difficulties later on.\\" The final agreement is based upon (and buttresses) \\"the rules-based nonproliferation regime created by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and including especially the IAEA safeguards system\\". === Participants === According to the U.S. State Department (Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs Julia Frifield), \\"The JCPOA is not a treaty or an executive agreement, and is not a signed document. The JCPOA reflects political commitments between Iran, the P5+1, and the EU.\\" Persian handwriting on top left side is a homage by Javad Zarif to his counterparts' efforts in the negotiations: \\"[I am] Sincere to Mr. Abbas [Araghchi] and Mr. Majid [Takht-Ravanchi].\\" File:Wang Yi 2014 (cropped).jpg China Wang Yi, Foreign Minister File:Laurent Fabius January 2015.jpg France Laurent Fabius, Foreign Minister File:Frank-Walter Steinmeier Feb 2014 (cropped).jpg Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister of Foreign Affairs File:Federica Mogherini Official.jpg European Union Federica Mogherini, High Representative File:Mohammad Javad Zarif 2014.jpg Iran Mohammad Javad Zarif, Minister of Foreign Affairs File:Sergey Lavrov 2014.jpg Russia Sergey Lavrov, Foreign Minister File:Philip Hammond, Secretary of State for Defence.jpg United Kingdom Philip Hammond, Foreign Secretary File:John Kerry official Secretary of State portrait.jpg United States John Kerry, Secretary of State ===Resolution=== The JCPOA is part of resolution 2231 voted by every member of the UN Security Council, with the following timetable: * 20 July 2015: Resolution voted by every member of the UN Security Council * Adoption Day: October 2015 * Implementation Day: 16 January 2016: the JCPOA came into effect. * Transition Day: eight years from Adoption Day or upon receipt by the Security Council of the report from the IAEA stating that the IAEA has reached the Broader Conclusion that all nuclear material in Iran remains in peaceful activities. * Resolution 2231 (2015) Termination Day: Ten years from Adoption Day ==Summary of provisions== The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) runs to 109 pages, including five annexes.

This reduction will be maintained for fifteen years.Eric Bradner, \\"What's in the Iran nuclear deal? 7 key points\\", CNN (2 April 2015).Eyder Peralta, \\"6 Things You Should Know About The Iran Nuclear Deal\\", NPR (14 July 2015).\\"Key Excerpts of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)\\", Office of the Press Secretary (14 July 2015). For the same fifteen- year period, Iran will be limited to enriching uranium to 3.67%, a percentage sufficient for civilian nuclear power and research, but not for building a nuclear weapon.\\"Press Availability on Nuclear Deal With Iran\\", U.S. Department of State (14 July 2015). However, the number of centrifuges is sufficient for a nuclear weapon, but not for nuclear power. This is a \\"major decline\\" in Iran's previous nuclear activity; prior to watering down its stockpile pursuant to the Joint Plan of Action interim agreement, Iran had enriched uranium to near 20% (medium-enriched uranium). These enriched uranium in excess of 300 kg of up to 3.67% will be down blended to natural uranium level or be sold in return for natural uranium, and the uranium enriched to between 5% and 20% will be fabricated into fuel plates for the Tehran Research Reactor or sold or diluted to an enrichment level of 3.67%. The implementation of the commercial contracts will be facilitated by P5+1. After fifteen years, all physical limits on enrichment will be removed, including limits on the type and number of centrifuges, Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium, and where Iran may have enrichment facilities. According to Belfer, at this point Iran could \\"expand its nuclear program to create more practical overt and covert nuclear weapons options\\".Resolution 2231, page 29 * For ten years, Iran will place over two-thirds of its centrifuges in storage, from its current stockpile of 19,000 centrifuges (of which 10,000 were operational) to no more than 6,104 operational centrifuges, with only 5,060 allowed to enrich uranium, with the enrichment capacity being limited to the Natanz plant. The centrifuges there must be IR-1 centrifuges, the first-generation centrifuge type which is Iran's oldest and least efficient; Iran will give up its advanced IR-2M centrifuges in this period. The non-operating centrifuges will be stored in Natanz and monitored by IAEA, but may be used to replace failed centrifuges.Justin Fishel, \\"Iran Nuclear Deal: A Look at the Winners and Losers\\", ABC News (14 July 2015). Iran will not build any new uranium- enrichment facilities for fifteen years. * Iran may continue research and development work on enrichment, but that work will take place only at the Natanz facility and include certain limitations for the first eight years. This is intended to keep the country to a breakout time of one year. * With cooperation from the \\"Working Group\\" (the P5+1 and possibly other countries), Iran is to modernise and rebuild the Arak heavy water research reactor based on an agreed design to support its peaceful nuclear research and production needs and purposes, but in such a way to minimise the production of plutonium and not to produce weapons-grade plutonium. The power of the redesigned reactor will not exceed 20 MWth. The P5+1 parties will support and facilitate the timely and safe construction of the Arak complex.Resolution 2231, page 21-22 All spent fuel will be sent out of the country. All excess heavy water which is beyond Iran's needs for the redesigned reactor will be made available for export to the international market based on international prices. In exchange, Iran received 130 tons of uranium in 2015 and in late 2016 was approved to receive 130 tons in 2017. For 15 years Iran will not engage in, or research, spent fuel reprocessing.Resolution 2231, page 21-24 Iran will also not build any additional heavy-water reactors or accumulate heavy water for 15 years. * Iran's Fordow facility will stop enriching uranium and researching uranium enrichment for at least fifteen years; the facility will be converted into a nuclear physics and technology center. For 15 years Fordow will maintain no more than 1,044 IR-1 centrifuges in six cascades in one wing of Fordow. \\"Two of those six cascades will spin without uranium and will be transitioned, including through appropriate infrastructure modification,\\" for stable radioisotope production for medical, agricultural, industrial, and scientific use. \\"The other four cascades with all associated infrastructure will remain idle.\\" Iran will not be permitted to have any fissile material in Fordow. * Iran is implementing an Additional Protocol that will continue in perpetuity for as long as Iran remains a party to the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The signing of the Additional Protocol represents a continuation of the monitoring and verification provisions \\"long after the comprehensive agreement between the P5+1 and Iran is implemented\\".\\"Factsheet: Iran and the Additional Protocol\\", Center for Arms Control and Non- proliferation (14 July 2015). * A comprehensive inspections regime will be implemented in order to monitor and confirm that Iran is complying with its obligations and is not diverting any fissile material. ** The IAEA will have multilayeredOren Dorell, \\"High-tech scrutiny key to Iran nuclear deal\\", USA Today (16 July 2015). oversight \\"over Iran's entire nuclear supply chain, from uranium mills to its procurement of nuclear-related technologies\\".Ishaan Tharoor, \\"How the nuclear deal can keep Iran from 'cheating,' according to a former U.N. inspector\\", The Washington Post blogs (15 July 2015). For declared nuclear sites such as Fordow and Natanz, the IAEA will have \\"round-the-clock access\\" to nuclear facilities and will be entitled to maintain continuous monitoring (including via surveillance equipment) at such sites.Rebecca Kaplan, \\"Obama says inspectors get access to 'any' site in Iran. Is it true?\\", CBS News (14 June 2015). The agreement authorizes the IAEA to make use of sophisticated monitoring technology, such as fiber-optic seals on equipment that can electronically send information to the IAEA; infrared satellite imagery to detect covert sites, \\"environmental sensors that can detect minute signs of nuclear particles\\"; tamper-resistant, radiation-resistant cameras.William J. Broad, \\"Iran Accord's Complexity Shows Impact of Bipartisan Letter\\", The New York Times (14 July 2015).Tim Mak, \\"The Spy Tech That Will Keep Iran in Line\\", The Daily Beast (7 July 2015). Other tools include computerized accounting programs to gather information and detect anomalies, and big data sets on Iranian imports, to monitor dual-use items. ** The number of IAEA inspectors assigned to Iran will triple, from 50 to 150 inspectors. ** If IAEA inspectors have concerns that Iran is developing nuclear capabilities at any non-declared sites, they may request access \\"to verify the absence of undeclared nuclear materials and activities or activities inconsistent with\\" the agreement, informing Iran of the basis for their concerns. The inspectors would only come from countries with which Iran has diplomatic relations. Iran may admit the inspectors to such site or propose alternatives to inspection that might satisfy the IAEA's concerns. If such an agreement cannot be reached, a process running to a maximum of 24 days is triggered. Under this process, Iran and the IAEA have 14 days to resolve disagreements among themselves. If they fail to, the Joint Commission (including all eight parties) would have one week in which to consider the intelligence which initiated the IAEA request. A majority of the Commission (at least five of the eight members) could then inform Iran of the action that it would be required to take within three more days.Carol Morello & Karen DeYoung, \\"Historic deal reached with Iran to limit nuclear program\\", The Washington Post (14 July 2015). The majority rule provision \\"means the United States and its European allies‚ÄîBritain, France, Germany and the EU‚Äîcould insist on access or any other steps and that Iran, Russia or China could not veto them\\". If Iran did not comply with the decision within three days, sanctions would be automatically reimposed under the snapback provision (see below). As a result of the above, the \\"breakout time\\"‚Äîthe time in which it would be possible for Iran to make enough material for a single nuclear weapon‚Äîwill increase from two to three months to one year, according to U.S. officials and U.S. intelligence.Obama: Iran Will Face Longer 'Breakout Time,' Though Not Indefinitely, All Things Considered, NPR (11 August 2015). See also \\"Transcript: President Obama's Full NPR Interview On Iran Nuclear Deal\\", NPR (7 April 2015). An August 2015 report published by a group of experts at Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs concurs in these estimates, writing that under the JCPOA, \\"over the next decade would be extended to roughly a year, from the current estimated breakout time of 2 to 3 months\\". The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation also accepts these estimates.\\"Factsheet: Longevity of Major Iran Nuclear Agreement Provisions\\", Center for Arms Control and Proliferation (14 July 2015).Richard Nephew, \\"Based on breakout timelines, the world is better off with the Iran nuclear deal than without it\\", Brookings Institution (17 July 2015). By contrast, Alan J. Kuperman, coordinator of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Project at the University of Texas at Austin, disputed the one-year assessment, arguing that under the agreement, Iran's breakout time \\"would be only about three months, not much longer than it is today\\". The longer breakout time would be in place for at least ten years; after that point, the breakout time would gradually decrease. By the 15th year, U.S. officials say the breakout time would return to the pre-JCPOA status quo of a few months. The Belfer Center report states: \\"Some contributors to this report believe that breakout time by year 15 could be comparable to what it is today‚Äîa few months‚Äîwhile others believe it could be reduced to a few weeks.\\" ===Exemptions=== Reuters reported that exemptions were granted to Iran prior to 16 January 2016. The reported purpose of the exemptions was so that sanctions relief and other benefits could start by that date, instead of Iran being in violation. The exemptions included: (a) Iran able to exceed the 300 Kg of 3.5% LEU limit in the agreement; (b) Iran able to exceed the zero Kg of 20% LEU limit in the agreement; (c) Iran to keep operating 19 \\"hot cells\\" that exceed the size limit in the agreement; (d) Iran to maintain control of 50 tonnes of heavy water that exceed the 130 tonne limit in the agreement by storing the excess at an Iran-controlled facility in Oman. In December 2016, the IAEA published decisions of the Joint Commission that spell out these clarifications of the JCPOA.\\"Communication dated 21 December 2016 to the Agency sent on behalf of High Representative Mogherini in her capacity as Coordinator of the Joint Commission established under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\\", IAEA, INFCIRC/907, 23 December 2016. ===Sanctions=== The following provisions regarding sanctions are written into the JCPOA: * Following the issuance of a IAEA report verifying implementation by Iran of the nuclear-related measures, the UN sanctions against Iran and some EU sanctions will terminate and some will be suspended. Once sanctions are lifted, Iran will recover approximately $100 billion of its assets (U.S. Treasury Department estimate) frozen in overseas banks.Jackie Northam, \\"Lifting Sanctions Will Release $100 Billion To Iran. Then What?\\", All Things Considered, NPR (16 July 2015). ** Eight years into the agreement, EU sanctions against a number of Iranian companies, individuals and institutions (such as the Revolutionary Guards) will be lifted.Felicia Schwartz, \\"When Sanctions Lift, Iranian Commander Will Benefit\\", The Wall Street Journal blogs (15 July 2015). * The United States will \\"cease\\" application of its nuclear- related secondary sanctionsEllie Geranmayeh, \\"Explainer: The Iran nuclear deal\\", European Council on Foreign Relations (17 July 2015) by presidential action or executive waiver. Secondary sanctions are those that sanction other countries for doing business with Iran. Primary U.S. sanctions, which prohibit U.S. firms from conducting commercial transactions with few exceptions, are not altered by the JCPOA. ** This step is not tied to any specific date, but is expected to occur \\"roughly in the first half of 2016\\".Implementation of the Iran nuclear agreement\\", Reuters (14 July 2015).\\"Nuclear Deal with Iran Establishes Plan for Sanctions Relief , Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP (11 August 2015), p. 5 (\\"According to the JCPOA's 'Implementation Plan' annex, Implementation Day occurs when two things happen 'simultaneously': (i) the 'IAEA-verified implementation by Iran' of certain nuclear-related measures; and (ii) the P5+1's implementation of specified forms of sanctions relief, including the termination of previous UNSC sanctions on Iran pursuant to UNSC Resolution 2231.22 Implementation Day, the crucial starting point for sanctions relief, is expected to occur in the first half of 2016, although the JCPOA sets no specific date on which, or by which, it will necessarily take place.\\") ** Sanctions relating to ballistic missile technologies would remain for eight years; similar sanctions on conventional weapon sales to Iran would remain for five years.Bryan Bender, \\"How the Pentagon got its way in Iran deal: Restrictions on advanced military weapons sales to Iran will remain in place for five to eight years\\", Politico (14 July 2015). ** However, all U.S. sanctions against Iran related to alleged human rights abuses, missiles, and support for terrorism are not affected by the agreement and will remain in place.Elizabeth Whitman, \\"What Sanctions Against Iran Won't Be Lifted? Bans For Terrorism Support, Human Rights Abuses To Remain Intact\\", International Business Times (14 July 2015). U.S. sanctions are viewed as more stringent, since many have extraterritorial effect (i.e., they apply worldwide). EU sanctions, by contrast, apply only in Europe. * No new UN or EU nuclear- related sanctions or restrictive measures will be imposed.Jessica Simeone & Anup Kaphle, \\"Here Are The Highlights of the Iran Nuclear Agreement\\", Buzzfeed News (14 July 2015). * If Iran violates the agreement, any of the P5+1 can invoke a \\"snap back\\" provision, under which the sanctions \\"snap back\\" into place (i.e., are reimplemented). ** Specifically, the JCPOA establishes the following dispute resolution process: if a party to the JCPOA has reason to believe that another party is not upholding its commitments under the agreement, then the complaining party may refer its complaint to the Joint Commission, a body created under the JCPOA to monitor implementation.Ankit Panda, \\"How the Iran Deal's 'Snap Back' Mechanism Will Keep Tehran Compliant\\", The Diplomat (15 July 2015). If a complaint made by a non-Iran party is not resolved to the satisfaction of the complaining party within thirty-five days of referral, then that party could treat the unresolved issue as grounds to cease performing its commitments under the JCPOA, notify the United Nations Security Council that it believes the issue constitutes significant non- performance, or both. The Security Council would then have thirty days to adopt a resolution to continue the lifting of sanctions. If such a resolution is not adopted within those thirty days, then the sanctions of all of the pre- JCPOA nuclear-related UN Security Council resolutions would automatically be re-imposed. Iran has stated that in such a case, it would cease performing its nuclear obligations under the deal. The effect of this rule is that any permanent member of the Security Council (United States, United Kingdom, China, Russia and France) can veto any ongoing sanctions relief, but no member can veto the re-imposition of sanctions. ** Snapback sanctions \\"would not apply with retroactive effect to contracts signed between any party and Iran or Iranian individuals and entities prior to the date of application, provided that the activities contemplated under and execution of such contracts are consistent with this JCPOA and the previous and current UN Security Council resolutions\\". Ankit Panda of The Diplomat states that this will make impossible any scenario where Iran is non-compliant with the JCPOA yet escapes re-imposition of sanctions. But Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (which opposes the agreement) argues that because the JCPOA provides that Iran could treat reinstatement of sanctions (in part or entirely) as grounds for leaving the agreement, the United States would be reluctant to impose a \\"snapback\\" for smaller violations: \\"The only thing you'll take to the Security Council are massive Iranian violations, because you're certainly not going to risk the Iranians walking away from the deal and engaging in nuclear escalation over smaller violations.\\" ===15-year term=== After the 15 years, the treaty will come to its term; then the extraordinary restrictions will no longer be applicable. At that time, in 2030, it is understood that people involved in the 1979 revolution will no longer be politically active. Some critics of the treaty consider it plausible that Iran could then make a nuclear bomb. But with this treaty Iran also ratified the Additional Protocol of the NPT and will thus be subject to inspection and oversight by the IAEA after this delay. ==International reaction== Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammad Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry shaking hands at the end of negotiations on 14 July 2015, Vienna. They shook hands on 26 September 2013 in the United Nations Headquarters for the first time. The nuclear deal received a mixed international reaction. Many countries expressed hope that it could achieve the denuclearization of Iran,\\"Wang Yi: China Plays Unique and Constructive Role in Reaching Comprehensive Agreement on Iranian Nuclear Issue\\" , Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China (14 July 2015).\\"Iran deal 'sufficiently robust' for 10 years, says France's foreign minister Laurent Fabius\\" , The Economic Times, Reuters (14 July 2015). while some of Iran's neighbouring countries, including Israel, and some U.S. lawmakers expressed distrust of the agreement, seeing it as seriously defective.Tom LoBianco & Sophie Tatum, \\"GOP 2016 hopefuls slam Iran nuclear deal\\" , CNN (14 July 2015).Adam Wollner, \\"How the 2016 Presidential Candidates Are Reacting to the Iran Deal\\", National Journal (14 July 2015). == Records == According to several commentators, JCPOA is the first of its kind in the annals of non- proliferation and is in many aspects unique. The 159-page JCPOA document and its five appendices, is the most spacious text of a multinational treaty since World War II, according to BBC Persian. This is the first time that the United Nations Security Council has recognized the nuclear enrichment program of a developing country and backs an agreement signed by several countries within the framework of a resolution (United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231). For the first time in the history of the United Nations, a country‚ÄîIran‚Äîwas able to abolish 6 UN resolutions against it‚Äî1696, 1737, 1747, 1803, 1835, 1929‚Äîwithout even one day of implementing them. Sanctions against Iran were also lifted for the first time. Throughout the history of international law, this is the first and only time that a country subject to Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter has managed to end its case and stop being subject to this chapter through diplomacy. All other cases have ended through either regime change, war or full implementation of the Security Council's decisions by the country. Gary Sick states that during the history of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), no country other than Iran has ever voluntarily agreed to put such extraordinary restrictions on its nuclear activities. During the final negotiations, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry stayed in Vienna for 17 days, making him the top American official devoting time to a single international negotiation in more than four decades. Mohammad Javad Zarif broke the record of an Iranian Foreign Minister being far from home with 18-days stay in Vienna, and set the record of 106 days of negotiations in 687 days, a number higher than any other chief nuclear negotiator in 12 years. The negotiations became the longest continuous negotiations with the presence of all foreign ministers of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The negotiations included 'rare events' in Iran‚ÄìUnited States relations not only since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, but also in the history of the bilateral relations. The U.S. Secretary of State and Iranian Foreign Minister met on 18 different dates‚Äîsometimes multiple occasions a day‚Äîand in 11 different cities, unprecedented since the beginning of the relations. On 27 April 2015 Kerry visited the official residence of the Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations to meet his counterpart. The encounter was the first of its kind since the Iran hostage crisis. On the sidelines of the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly, President Obama shook hands with Zarif, marking the first such event in history. The event was also noted in form of diplomatic ranks, as a head of state shook hands with a minister. Obama is reported to have said in the meeting: \\"Too much effort has been put into the JCPOA and we all should be diligent to implement it.\\" ==ProcessIncorporation into international law by the United Nations Security Council=== As provided for in the JCPOA, the agreement was formally endorsed by the UN Security Council.\\"Iran nuclear deal: UN Security Council likely to vote next week: US diplomats to promote deal to UN counterparts in coming days\\", CBC, Thomson Reuters (15 July 2015).Somini Sengupta, Consensus Gives Security Council Momentum in Mideast, but Question Is How Much, The New York Times (16 July 2015). .CBS News/Associated Press, Iran deal set to become international law (17 July 2015).Somini Sengupta, \\"U.N. Moves to Lift Sanctions on Iran After Nuclear Deal\\", The New York Times (20 July 2015). There is disagreement about whether the deal is legally binding on the United States. On 15 July 2015 the American ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, circulated a 14-page draft to Council members. On 20 July 2015 the Security Council unanimously approved the resolution‚ÄîUnited Nations Security Council resolution 2231\\"United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 (2015)\\", adopted by the Security Council at its 7488th meeting, on 20 July 2015‚Äîin a 15‚Äì0 vote. The resolution delayed its official implementation for 90 days to allow for U.S. Congressional consideration under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015. The resolution laid out the steps for terminating sanctions imposed by seven past Security Council resolutions, but retained an arms embargo and ballistic missile technology ban. The resolution did not affect sanctions imposed separately by the United States and the European Union. It also codified the \\"snapback\\" mechanism of the agreement, under which all Security Council sanctions will be automatically reimposed if Iran breaches the deal. Speaking immediately after the vote, Power told the Security Council that sanctions relief would start only when Iran \\"verifiably\\" met its obligations. Power also called upon Iran \\"to immediately release all unjustly detained Americans\\", specifically naming Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini, and Jason Rezaian, were imprisoned by Iran was detained at the time, and Robert A. Levinson, who has been missing in the country.Samantha Power, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, \\"Explanation of Vote at a UN Security Council Vote on Resolution 2231 on Iran Non-proliferation\\" U.S. State Department (20 July 2015). Hekmati, Abedini, and Rezaian were subsequently released in a January 2016 prisoner exchange, which Secretary of State Kerry said had been accelerated by the nuclear agreement.Michael Pearson & Elise Labott, 5 Americans released by Iran, 4 as part of prisoner swap, CNN (16 January 2016). ===Approval by European Union=== On the same day that the Security Council approved a resolution, the European Union formally approved the JCPOA via a vote of the EU Foreign Affairs Council (the group of EU foreign ministers) meeting in Brussels. This sets into motion the lifting of certain EU sanctions, including those prohibiting the purchase of Iranian oil.Robin Emmott & Francesco Guarascio, \\"Europe backs Iran nuclear deal in signal to U.S. Congress\\", Reuters (20 July 2015). The EU continues its sanctions relating to human rights and its sanctions prohibiting the export of ballistic missile technology. The approval by the EU was seen as a signal to the U.S. Congress. ===Review period in the United States Congress=== Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, and Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew defending the JCPOA at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on 23 July 2015 Under U.S. law the JCPOA is a non-binding political commitment. According to the U.S. State Department, it specifically is not an executive agreement or a treaty. There are widespread incorrect reports that it is an executive agreement.Amber Phillips, \\"Can Congress stop the Iran deal?\\", The Washington Post (1 July 2015).Scott Bomboy, \\"Veto showdown on tap for Congress after Iran nuclear deal\\" , National Constitution Center (15 July 2015). In contrast to treaties, which require two-thirds of the Senate to consent to ratification, political commitments require no congressional approval, and are not legally binding as a matter of domestic law (although in some cases they may be binding on the U.S. as a matter of international law). On 22 May 2015 President Obama signed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 into law; this legislation passed by the Senate in a 98-1 vote and the House in a 400-25 vote, and was approved by Obama on 22 May 2015.\\"Iran Nuclear Review Act Becomes Law\\", Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP (29 May 2015). Under the Act, once a nuclear agreement was negotiated with Iran, Congress had sixty days in which it could pass a resolution of approval, a resolution of disapproval, or do nothing. The Act also included additional time beyond the sixty days for the president to veto a resolution and for Congress to take a vote on whether to override or sustain the veto.Kevin Liptak, \\"Now that he has a deal with Iran, Obama must face Congress\\", CNN (14 July 2015). Republicans could only defeat the deal if they mustered the two- thirds of both houses of Congress needed to override an expected veto by Obama of any resolution of disapproval. On 19 July 2015 the State Department officially transmitted to Congress the JCPOA, its annexes, and related materials.\\"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\\", United States Department of State (19 June 2015). These documents included the Unclassified Verification Assessment Report on the JCPOA and the Intelligence Community's Classified Annex to the Verification Assessment Report. The sixty-day review period began the next day, 20 July,Eric Bradner, \\"State Dept. sends Iran deal to Congress\\", CNN (19 July 2015).Jonathan Weisman & Julie Hirschfeld Davis, \\"Republican Lawmakers Vow Fight to Derail Nuclear Deal\\", The New York Times (14 July 2005). and ended on 17 September.Patricia Zengerle, \\"House to vote on Iran deal disapproval resolution\\", Reuters (4 August 2015). Senator Ted Cruz introduced a resolution seeking a delay in the review period, arguing that the 60-day congressional review under the Act should not begin until the Senate obtained a copy of all bilateral Iran-IAEA documents. This resolution did not pass. Ultimately a resolution of disapproval was brought to the Senate floor but failed. A resolution of approval was brought to the House floor, but it too failed. As a result, the agreement went into effect following congressional review period.Dennis C. Jett, The Iran Nuclear Deal: Bombs, Bureaucrats, and Billionaires (Springer, 2018), p. 35.

In comments made in the East Room of the White House on 15 July 2015, Obama urged Congress to support the agreement, saying \\"If we don't choose wisely, I believe future generations will judge us harshly, for letting this moment slip away.\\"Michael D. Shear & Julie Hitschfeld Davis, \\"Obama Begins 60-Day Campaign to Win Over Iran Deal Skeptics at Home and Abroad\\", The New York Times (15 July 2015). He said the inspections regime in the agreement was among the most vigorous ever negotiated, and criticized opponents of the deal for failing to offer a viable alternative to it. Obama said, \\"If 99 percent of the world's community and the majority of nuclear experts look at this thing and they say 'this will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb,' and you are arguing either that it does not ... then you should have some alternative to present. And I haven't heard that.\\"\\"Full text: Obama's news conference on the Iran nuclear deal\\", The Washington Post (15 July 2015).\\"Iran nuclear deal: '99% of world agrees' says Obama\\", BBC News (15 July 2015). The same day, he made a case for the deal on the agreement in an interview with New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. Obama stated: Also on 15 July, Vice President Joe Biden met with Senate Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee on Capitol Hill, where he made a presentation on the agreement.Deirdre Walsh & Ted Barrett, \\"WH dispatches Joe Biden to lock down Iran deal on Capitol Hill\\", CNN (16 July 2015). On 18 July Obama devoted his weekly radio address to the agreement, saying, \\"this deal will make America and the world safer and more secure\\" and rebutting \\"a lot of overheated and often dishonest arguments about it\\";\\"Weekly Address: A Comprehensive, Long-Term Deal with Iran\\", White House Office of the Press Secretary (18 July 2015). Obama said, \\"as commander-in-chief, I make no apology for keeping this country safe and secure through the hard work of diplomacy over the easy rush to war.\\" On 23 July Obama met in the White House Cabinet Room with about a dozen undecided House Democrats to speak about the agreement and seek their support. The debate over the agreement was marked by acrimony between the White House and Republicans inside and outside of Congress. Cruz said that under the agreement \\"the Obama administration will become the leading financier of terrorism against America in the world.\\"Peter Baker, \\"Obama Criticizes Huckabee, Trump, Cruz and Other Republicans\\", The New York Times (27 July 2015).

This comparison was denounced by the Anti-Defamation League, the National Jewish Democratic Council, and various Israeli government officials.Amita Kelly, 'Offensive,' 'Sad': Reaction To Huckabee's Holocaust 'Oven' Reference, NPR (27 July 2015).Ishaan Tharoor, \\"Israelis scold Huckabee for saying Iran deal sends them to 'door of the oven'\\", The Washington Post (28 July 2015). At a 27 June news conference Obama specifically criticized Huckabee, Cruz, and Cotton, saying that such remarks were \\"just part of a general pattern we've seen that would be considered ridiculous if it weren't so sad\\", especially from \\"leaders in the Republican Party\\". Obama said, \\"fling[ing] out ad hominem attacks like that ... doesn't help inform the American people\\". \\"This is a deal that has been endorsed by people like Brent Scowcroft and Sam Nunn ... historic Democratic and Republican leaders on arms control and on keeping America safe. And so when you get rhetoric like this, maybe it gets attention and maybe this is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines, but it's not the kind of leadership that is needed for America right now\\", he added.\\"Remarks by President Obama and Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn of Ethiopia in Joint Press Conference, National Palace Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\\", White House Office of the Press Secretary (27 July 2015). On 5 August Obama gave a speech before an audience of around 200 at American University, marking a new phase in the administration's campaign for the agreement.Julie Hirschfeld Davis, \\"It's Either Iran Nuclear Deal or 'Some Form of War,' Obama Warns\\", The New York Times (5 August 2015).Remarks by the President on the Iran Nuclear Deal, American University, Washington, D.C., White House Office of the Press Secretary (5 August 2015). Another transcript of this speech was also printed by The Washington Post. He said, \\"Let's not mince words: The choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy and some form of war‚Äîmaybe not tomorrow, maybe not three months from now, but soon. How can we in good conscience justify war before we've tested a diplomatic agreement that achieves our objectives?\\" In his speech, Obama also invoked a speech made by John F. Kennedy at American University in 1963 in favor of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Obama also said the opponents of the agreement were the same people who created the \\"drumbeat of war\\" that led to the Iraq War and criticized \\"knee-jerk partisanship that has become all too familiar, rhetoric that renders every decision made to be a disaster, a surrender\\". New York Senator Chuck Schumer, a senior Democrat, made a different assessment of prospects for war by distinguishing between nuclear and non-nuclear aspects of the agreement. In each case he asked whether we are better off with the agreement or without it, and his conclusion was: \\"when it comes to the nuclear aspects of the agreement within ten years, we might be slightly better off with it. However, when it comes to the nuclear aspects after ten years and the non-nuclear aspects, we would be better off without it.\\" Then Schumer assessed the Iranian government, saying, \\"Who's to say this dictatorship will not prevail for another ten, twenty, or thirty years? To me, the very real risk that Iran will not moderate and will, instead, use the agreement to pursue its nefarious goals is too great.\\" Finally, Schumer concluded: \\"I will vote to disapprove the agreement, not because I believe war is a viable or desirable option, nor to challenge the path of diplomacy. It is because I believe Iran will not change, and under this agreement it will be able to achieve its dual goals of eliminating sanctions while ultimately retaining its nuclear and non- nuclear power.\\" In the same 5 August speech, Obama said, \\"Just because Iranian hard-liners chant 'Death to America' does not mean that that's what all Iranians believe. In fact, it's those hard-liners who are most comfortable with the status quo. It's those hard-liners chanting 'Death to America' who have been most opposed to the deal. They're making common cause with the Republican caucus.\\"Eliza Collins, \\"President Obama stands by comments linking Republicans to Iranian hard-liners\\", Politico (10 August 2015). Congressional Republican leaders criticized this statement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called it \\"crass political rhetoric\\" that was a strategy to \\"Demonize your opponents, gin up the base, get the Democrats all angry, and rally around the president.\\" McConnell said, \\"This is an enormous national security debate that the president will leave behind, under the Constitution, a year and a half from now, and the rest of us will be dealing with the consequences of it. So I wish he would tone down the rhetoric and let's talk about the facts\\" and promised that Republicans would discuss the agreement respectfully in September. Republican Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of Foreign Relations Committee, asserted that the president was \\"trying to shut down debate by saying that those who have legitimate questions, legitimate questions‚Äîare somehow unpatriotic, are somehow compared to hardliners in Iran\\". Obama subsequently stood by his statement, with White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest calling it a \\"statement of fact\\" and Obama saying in an interview, \\"Remember, what I said was that it's the hard-liners in Iran who are most opposed to this deal. And I said, in that sense, they're making common cause with those who are opposed to this deal here.

Clapper remained \\"concerned about compliance and deceit\\" but \\"pointed out that during the negotiation period [Iran] complied with rules\\" negotiated under the interim agreement (the Joint Plan of Action). Public debate An intense public debate in the United States took place during the congressional review period.Deb Riechmann, High-stakes lobbying on Iran deal; pressure for Congress, San Francisco Chronicle, Associated Press (22 July 2015). \\"Some of the wealthiest and most powerful donors in American politics, those for and against the accord\\", became involved in the public debate,Jonathan Weisman & Nicholas Confessore, \\"Donors Descend on Schumer and Others in Debate on Iran\\", The New York Times (12 August 2015). although \\"mega-donors\\" opposing the agreement contributed substantially more money than those supporting it.Catherine Ho, \\"Mega-donors opposing Iran deal have upper hand in fierce lobbying battle\\", The Washington Post (13 August 2015). From 2010 to early August 2015 the foundations of Sheldon Adelson, Paul Singer, and Haim Saban contributed a total of $13 million (at least $7.5 million, at least $2.6 million, and at least $2.9 million, respectively) to advocacy groups opposing an agreement with Iran. On the other side, three groups lobbying in support of the agreement received at least $803,000 from the Ploughshares Fund, at least $425,000 from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and at least $68,500 from George Soros and his foundation. Other philanthropists and donors supporting an agreement include S. Daniel Abraham, Tim Gill, Norman Lear, Margery Tabankin, and Arnold Hiatt. Others welcomed the JCPOA as a step forward.Ali Gharib, \\"Iranian-Americans welcome nuclear deal, despite opposition to regime\\", Al Jazeera America (16 July 2015).

From mid-July to 4 August 2015 AIPAC's Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran spent more than $11 million on network television political advertisements opposing the agreement in 23 states, including more than $1 million in California, Florida, New York, and Texas.John Bresnahan & Anna Palmer, \\"Iran deal foes spend big, get little so far\\", Politico (4 August 2015). In the first week of August AIPAC said it had 400 meetings with congressional offices as part of its campaign to defeat the agreement. In contrast to AIPAC, another pro-Israel organization, J Street, supported the agreement, and planned a $5 million advertising effort to encourage Congress to support it.Jacob Kornbluh, \\"J Street launches multimillion dollar campaign in support of Iran nuclear deal\\", Haaretz (16 July 2015).

From mid-July through early August J Street reported having 125 meetings with congressional offices. J Street also paid to fly prominent Israelis who support the agreement (including Amram Mitzna, a retired Israeli general, member of the Knesset, and mayor of Haifa) to the United States to help persuade members of Congress to support it. The group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) opposed the agreement and committed to spending more than $20 million on a national \\"TV, radio, print and digital campaign\\" against it.\\"Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran (CNFI) Launches Third National TV Ad\\" (press release), United Against Nuclear Iran (20 August 2015).

Gordon, \\"Head of Group Opposing Iran Accord Quits Post, Saying He Backs Deal\\", The New York Times (11 August 2015). Samore thus stepped down as president and was replaced by ex-Senator Joseph I.

The bus ad was sponsored by New York Assemblyman Dov Hikind, an opponent of the agreement.Will Bredderman, \\"Religious Jewish Pols Bash Manhattan Congressman Over Iran Deal Support\\", The Observer (21 August 2015). Various other groups also ran ad campaigns for or against the agreement. John R.

The New York-based Iran Project, a nonprofit led by former high-level U.S. diplomats and funded by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, along with the United Nations Association of the United States, supported the agreement.Peter Waldman, \\"How Freelance Diplomacy Bankrolled by Rockefellers Has Paved the Way for an Iran Deal\\", Bloomberg Politics (2 July 2015). The Rockefeller fund also supported the San Francisco-based Ploughshares Fund, which spent several years marshaling support for an agreement. On 17 July 2015 a bipartisan open letter endorsing the Iran agreement was signed by more than 100 former U.S. ambassadors and high-ranking State Department officials.Julian Hattem, \\"More than 100 ex-US ambassadors pledge backing for Iran deal\\", The Hill (17 July 2015).\\"Letter to the President from over 100 former American Ambassadors on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran's Nuclear Program\\" (17 July 2015). The ex-ambassadors wrote: \\"If properly implemented, this comprehensive and rigorously negotiated agreement can be an effective instrument in arresting Iran's nuclear program and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons in the volatile and vitally important region of the Middle East. In our judgment the [plan] deserves Congressional support and the opportunity to show it can work. We firmly believe that the most effective way to protect U.S. national security, and that of our allies and friends is to ensure that tough-minded diplomacy has a chance to succeed before considering other more costly and risky alternatives.\\" Among the signatories to the letter were Daniel C. Kurtzer, James R. Jones, Frank E. Loy, Princeton N. Lyman, Jack F. Matlock Jr., Donald F. McHenry, Thomas E. McNamara, and Thomas R. Pickering. A separate public letter to Congress in support of the agreement from five former U.S. ambassadors to Israel from administrations of both parties and three former Under Secretaries of State was released on 26 July 2015.James Fallows, \\"A Guide to the Iran Nuclear Deal's Supporters and Opponents\\", The Atlantic (28 July 2015).

Wisner.\\"Letter to Congressional Leadership from Former Under Secretaries of State and former American Ambassadors to Israel on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\\" (27 July 2015). The former officials wrote, \\"We are persuaded that this agreement will put in place a set of constraints and monitoring measures that will arrest Iran's nuclear program for at least fifteen years and assure that this agreement will leave Iran no legitimate avenue to produce a nuclear weapon during the next ten to fifteen years. This landmark agreement removes the threat that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose to the region and to Israel specifically.\\" Another public letter to Congress urging approval of the agreement was signed by a bipartisan group of more than 60 \\"national-security leaders\\", including politicians, retired military officers, and diplomats. This letter, dated 20 July 2015, stated: \\"We congratulate President Obama and all the negotiators for a landmark agreement unprecedented in its importance for preventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran. ...

Olson; Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy; and Assistant Secretary for Nonproliferation Robert Einhorn. On 8 August 2015, 29 prominent U.S. scientists, mostly physicists, published an open letter endorsing the agreement.William J. Broad, \\"29 U.S. Scientists Praise Iran Nuclear Deal in Letter to Obama\\", The New York Times (8 August 2015).\\"Scientists' Letter to Obama on Iran Nuclear Deal\\" (8 August 2015), reprinted by The New York Times. The letter, addressed to Obama, said: \\"We congratulate you and your team on negotiating a technically sound, stringent and innovative deal that will provide the necessary assurance in the coming decade and more than Iran is not developing nuclear weapons, and provides a basis for further initiatives to raise the barriers to nuclear proliferation in the Middle East and around the globe.\\" The letter also stated that the agreement \\"will advance the cause of peace and security in the Middle East and can serve as a guidepost for future nonproliferation agreements\\". The 29 signatories included \\"some of the world's most knowledgeable experts in the fields of nuclear weapons and arms control\\", many of whom have held Q clearances and have been longtime advisers to Congress, the White House, and federal agencies. The five primary authors were Richard L. Garwin (a nuclear physicist who played a key role in the development of the first hydrogen bomb and whom The New York Times described as \\"among the last living physicists who helped usher in the nuclear age\\"); Robert J. Goldston (Director of the Princeton Program on Science and Global Security and former director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory); R. Scott Kemp (an MIT professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering and a former science advisor for nonproliferation and arms control at the State Department); Rush D. Holt (a physicist and former U.S. Representative who is now president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science); and Frank N. von Hippel (Princeton Professor of Public Policy and former assistant director for national security in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy). Six Nobel Prize in Physics laureates co-signed the letter: Philip W. Anderson of Princeton University; Leon N. Cooper of Brown University; Sheldon L. Glashow of Boston University; David Gross of the University of California, Santa Barbara; Burton Richter of Stanford University; and Frank Wilczek of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Among the other scientists to sign are Siegfried S. Hecker (a Stanford physicist and the former director of Los Alamos National Laboratory), Freeman Dyson (of Princeton), and Sidney Drell (of Stanford). An open letter endorsing the agreement signed by 36 retired military generals and admirals and titled \\"The Iran Deal Benefits U.S. National Security: An Open Letter from Retired Generals and Admirals\\" was released on 11 August 2015.Karen DeYoung, \\"Dozens of retired generals, admirals back Iran nuclear deal\\", The Washington Post (11 August 2015).\\"Read: An open letter from retired generals and admirals on the Iran nuclear deal\\" (letter released 11 August 2015), reprinted by The Washington Post. The letter, signed by retired officers from all five branches of the U.S. armed services, said the agreement was \\"the most effective means currently available to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons\\" and \\"If at some point it becomes necessary to consider military action against Iran, gathering sufficient international support for such an effort would only be possible if we have first given the diplomatic path a chance. We must exhaust diplomatic options before moving to military ones.\\" The signers included General James E. \\"Hoss\\" Cartwright of the Marine Corps, former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Joseph P. Hoar of the Marine Corps, the former commander of the U.S. Central Command; and Generals Merrill McPeak and Lloyd W. Newton of the Air Force. Other signers included Lieutenant Generals Robert G. Gard Jr. and Claudia J. Kennedy; Vice Admiral Lee F. Gunn; Rear Admirals Garland Wright and Joseph Sestak; and Major General Paul D. Eaton. The above letter was answered on 25 August 2015 by a letter signed by more than 200 retired generals and admirals opposing the deal.Emma-Jo Morris, \\"More Than 200 Retired Generals & Admirals Sign Letter Opposing the Iran Deal\\", IranTruth.org (26 August 2015, subsequently updated). The letter asserted: \\"The agreement does not 'cut off every pathway' for Iran to acquire nuclear weapons. To the contrary, it provides Iran with a legitimate pathway for doing exactly that simply by abiding by the deal. ... The JCPOA would threaten the national security and vital interests of the United States and, therefore, should be disapproved by the Congress.\\" This letter was organized by Leon A. \\"Bud\\" Edney; other signers included Admiral James A. Lyons; Lieutenant General William G. Boykin, former Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence; and Lieutenant General Thomas McInerney, former vice commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe. Retired Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni said he had refused requests from both sides to sign their letters, telling Time magazine, \\"I'm convinced that 90% of the guys who signed the letter one way or the other don't have any clue about whether it's a good or bad deal. They sign it because somebody's asked them to sign it.\\" Of the JCPOA, Zinni said: \\"The agreement's fine, if you think it can work. But if this is a Neville Chamberlain then you're in a world of shit.\\"Mark Thompson, \\"Retired Generals Wage Letter War Over Iran Nuclear Deal Vote\\", Time (27 August 2015). On 13 August retired Senators Carl Levin of Michigan, a Democrat, and John Warner of Virginia, a Republican, published an op-ed in support of the agreement, \\"Why hawks should also back the Iran deal\\", in Politico.Carl Levin & John Warner, \\"Why hawks should also back the Iran deal\\", Politico (13 August 2015). Levin and Warner, both past chairmen of the Senate Armed Services Committee, argued, \\"If we reject the agreement, we risk isolating ourselves and damaging our ability to assemble the strongest possible coalition to stop Iran\\" in the event that military action was needed in the future. Levin and Warner wrote, \\"The deal on the table is a strong agreement on many counts, and it leaves in place the robust deterrence and credibility of a military option. We urge our former colleagues not to take any action which would undermine the deterrent value of a coalition that participates in and could support the use of a military option. The failure of the United States to join the agreement would have that effect.\\" On 14 August retired senators Richard Lugar of Indiana, a Republican, and J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, a Democrat, also wrote in support of the agreement.Richard Lugar & J. Bennett Johnston, \\"Why we disagree with Chuck Schumer on the Iran deal\\", Reuters Great Debate (14 August 2015). In a column for Reuters Lugar and Johnston argued, \\"Rejection of the agreement would severely undermine the U.S. role as a leader and reliable partner around the globe. If Washington walks away from this hard-fought multilateral agreement, its dependability would likely be doubted for decades.\\" They also wrote: \\"Tehran would be the winner of this U.S. rejection because it would achieve its major objective: the lifting of most sanctions without being required to accept constraints on its nuclear program. Iran could also claim to be a victim of American perfidy and try to convince other nations to break with U.S. leadership and with the entire international sanctions regime.\\" On 17 August 2015 a group of 75 arms control and nuclear nonproliferation experts issued a joint statement endorsing the agreement.\\"The Comprehensive P5+1 Nuclear Agreement With Iran: A Net-Plus for Nonproliferation: Statement from Nuclear Nonproliferation Specialists\\", Arms Control Association (17 August 2015).Michael Crowley, \\"Nuclear experts fall in behind Obama: The deal with Iran exceeds historical standards for arms control agreements, 75 experts say\\", Politico (18 August 2015). The statement said, \\"the JCPOA is a strong, long-term, and verifiable agreement that will be a net-plus for international nuclear nonproliferation efforts\\" and that the JCPOA's \\"rigorous limits and transparency measures will make it very likely that any future effort by Iran to pursue nuclear weapons, even a clandestine program, would be detected promptly, providing the opportunity to intervene decisively to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon\\". The letter was organized through the nonpartisan Arms Control Association. Among the 75 signatories were the Valerie Plame and Joseph C. Wilson; former IAEA director-general Hans Blix; Morton H. Halperin; and experts from the Brookings Institution, Stimson Center, and other think tanks. On 3 September an open letter to Obama signed by 56 people was issued criticizing the JCPOA as \\"unverifiable\\". The letter said: \\"Guided by our experience with U.S. and foreign nuclear weapons programs‚Äîas well as with the history and practice of arms control, nonproliferation, and intelligence matters, we judge the current JCPOA to be a very bad deal indeed.\\"Paul Goodenough, \\"Arms Control Experts to Obama: Your Iran Deal Is 'Not Verifiable'\\", CNS News (3 September 2015). Signers included Boykin; Bolton; ex-CIA director James Woolsey, former national security advisor Robert McFarlane; Paula A. DeSutter, former Assistant Secretary of State for Verification, Compliance, and Implementation; various former ACDA officials; and former Sandia National Laboratories president/director C. Paul Robinson. Foreign diplomats were also involved in the congressional debate. The Israeli ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer appeared on cable television shows to attack the agreement, while ambassadors from European nations, including Sir Peter Westmacott, the British ambassador to the United States, \\"came on to say the precise opposite\\".Peter Foster, \\"Barack Obama's big gamble: Will Iran deal secure his presidential legacy?\\", The Daily Telegraph (18 July 2015). Dermer also lobbied members of Congress on Capitol Hill against the agreement,Deb Riechmann, \\"Dermer becomes PM's pointman as battle over Iran deal moves to DC\\", The Washington Post, Associated Press (19 July 2015). while diplomats from France, Britain, and Germany made the rounds on Capitol Hill to advocate for the agreement.Karen DeYoung, \\"Senate opponents of Iran deal draw hard lines against White House\\", The Washington Post (23 July 2015). On 4 August P5+1 diplomats held \\"a rare meeting of world powers' envoys on Capitol Hill\\" with about 30 Senate Democrats to urge support for the agreement, saying, \\"If Congress rejects this good deal, and the U.S. is forced to walk away, Iran will be left with an unconstrained nuclear program with far weaker monitoring arrangements, the current international consensus on sanctions would unravel, and international unity and pressure on Iran would be seriously undermined.\\"John Hudson, \\"P5+1 Nations Press Senate Democrats to Support Iran Deal\\", Foreign Policy (6 August 2015). On Meet the Press on 6 September 2015, former Secretary of State Colin Powell expressed support for the nuclear agreement with Iran, saying that it was \\"a pretty good deal\\".Alexandra Jaffe, \\"Colin Powell: Iran Deal Is a 'Pretty Good Deal'\\", NBC News (6 September 2015). Powell said that various provisions accepted by Iran‚Äîsuch as the reduction in centrifuges and the uranium stockpile and the agreement to shut down its plutonium reactor‚Äîwere \\"remarkable changes\\" that stopped the Iranian pathway to a nuclear weapons program. Powell also defended the verification provisions of the agreement, saying: \\"I think a very vigorous verification regime has been put into place.\\" Former Ambassador Dennis Ross, a longtime American negotiator in the Middle East, wrote that he was not yet convinced by either proponents or opponents of the agreement.Dennis Ross, \\"How to Make Iran Keep its Word\\", Politico (29 July 2015). Ross wrote that the United States should be focused on \\"deterring the Iranians from cheating\\" (e.g., by producing highly enriched uranium) after year fifteen of the agreement. Ross wrote, \\"President Obama emphasizes that the agreement is based on verification not trust. But our catching Iran cheating is less important than the price they know they will pay if we catch them. Deterrence needs to apply not just for the life of the deal.\\" As part of a deterrence strategy, Ross proposed transferring to Israel the U.S. Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) \\"bunker buster\\" bomb at some point before year fifteen of the agreement. In a 25 August op-ed in The Washington Post, Ross and David H. Petraeus again argued for transferring the MOP to Israel.Dennis Ross & David H. Petraeus, \\"How to put some teeth into the nuclear deal with Iran\\", The Washington Post (25 August 2015). The Jewish American community was divided on the agreement. On 19 August 2015 leaders of the Reform Jewish movement, the largest Jewish denomination in the United States, issued a lengthy public statement expressing a neutral position.Chemi Shalev, \\"Reflecting Deep Divisions, Reform Movement Abstains From 'Yes' or 'No' on Iran Deal\\", Haaretz (19 August 2015).\\"Reform Jewish Movement Response to Iran Deal: Address Important Concerns, Focus on the Day After\\" , Union for Reform Judaism (20 August 2015). The statement, signed by the leaders of the Union for Reform Judaism, Central Conference of American Rabbis, Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism and Association of Reform Zionists of America, reflected what Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the URJ, called \\"deep divisions within the movement\\". On 20 August 2015 a group of 26 prominent current and foreign American Jewish communal leaders published a full-page ad in The New York Times with a statement backing the agreement; signers included three former chairs of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations as well as former AIPAC executive director Tom Dine.Nathan Guttman, \\"26 Top Jewish Leaders Back Iran Deal in New York Times Ad\\" (20 August 2015). Separately, on 17 August 2015 a group of 340 rabbis organized by Ameinu wrote an open letter to Congress in support of the agreement, saying: \\"We, along with many other Jewish leaders, fully support this historic nuclear accord.\\"\\"340 U.S. rabbis sign letter supporting Iran deal\\", Jewish Telegraphic Agency (17 August 2015). The signers were mostly Reform rabbis but included at least 50 rabbis from the Conservative movement and at least one Orthodox rabbi.Lauren Markoe, \\"340 rabbis urge Congress to approve Iran nuclear deal\\", Religion News Service (17 August 2015). Prominent rabbis who signed this letter included Sharon Brous, Burton Visotzky, Nina Beth Cardin, Lawrence Kushner, Sharon Kleinbaum, and Amy Eilberg. In a separate letter released on 27 August, 11 Democratic Jewish former members of Congress urged support for the agreement; the letter noted the signatories' pro-Israel credentials and said the agreement \\"halts the immediate threat of a nuclear-armed Iran\\" while rejecting it would \\"put Iran back on the path to develop a nuclear weapon within two to three months\\".Jewish Telegraphic Agency, \\"11 Jewish ex-congressmen back Iran deal; 190 former generals oppose\\" (27 August 2015). Signatories included former Senator Carl Levin and former Representatives Barney Frank, Mel Levine, Steve Rothman, and Robert Wexler. Conversely, in late August a group of 900 rabbis signed an open letter by Kalman Topp and Yonah Bookstein calling upon Congress to reject the agreement.Aron Chilewich, \\"More than 900 rabbis sign letter opposing Iran nuclear deal\\", The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles (27 August 2015).

The Roman Catholic Church expressed support for the agreement. In a 14 July 2015 letter to Congress Bishop Oscar Cant√∫, chairman of the Committee on International Justice and Peace of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, wrote that the JCPOA was \\"a momentous agreement\\" that \\"signals progress in global nuclear non-proliferation\\".Vinnie Rotondaro, \\"Signs of 'seamless garment' in Catholic support for Iran nuke deal\\", National Catholic Reporter (13 August 2015).\\"Bishop Cant√∫ Welcomes Iran Nuclear Deal, Urges Congress To Endorse Result of Negotiations\\", United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (14 July 2015). Cant√∫ wrote that Catholic bishops in the United States \\"will continue to urge Congress to endorse the result of these intense negotiations because the alternative leads toward armed conflict, an outcome of profound concern to the Church\\". On 25 August 2015 a group of 53 Christian faith leaders from a variety of denominations sent a message to Congress urging them to support the agreement. The Christian leaders wrote: \\"This is a moment to remember the wisdom of Jesus who proclaimed from the Sermon on the Mount, 'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God' (Matthew 5:9). ... There is no question we are all better off with this deal than without it.\\" The letter was coordinated by a Quaker group, the Friends Committee on National Legislation. Signatories to the letter included Jim Wallis of Sojourners; John C. Dorhauer, general minister and president of the United Church of Christ; Shane Claiborne; Adam Estle of Evangelicals for Middle East Understanding; Archbishop Vicken Aykazian of the Armenian Orthodox Church; A. Roy Medley, the head of American Baptist Churches USA; the Reverend Paula Clayton Dempsey of the Alliance of Baptists, senior pastor Joel C.

Congressional committee hearings A hearing on the JCPOA before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee took place on 23 July 2015. Secretary of State Kerry, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, and Energy Secretary Moniz testified.Jonathan Weisman & Michael R. Gordon, \\"Kerry Defends Iran Nuclear Deal Before Skeptical Senate\\", The New York Times (23 July 2015).\\"Iran Nuclear Agreement Review\\", United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations (23 July 2015) (video of hearing). Republican Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the committee chairman, said in his opening statement that when the talks began the goal was to dismantle the Iranian nuclear program, whereas the achieved agreement codified \\"the industrialization of their nuclear program\\". Corker, addressing Kerry, said, \\"I believe you've been fleeced\\" and \\"what you've really done here is you have turned Iran from being a pariah to now Congress‚ÄîCongress being a pariah.\\" Corker said a new threshold in U.S. foreign policy had been crossed and the agreement would \\"enable a state sponsor of terror to obtain sophisticated, industrial nuclear development program that has, as we know, only one real practical need\\". The committee's ranking Democratic member, Senator Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, said he had many questions and his hope was that the answers will cause a debate \\"in Congress and the American people\\". Democrats, led by Senator Barbara Boxer of California, expressed support for the agreement, with Boxer saying that criticisms by Republicans were \\"ridiculous\\", \\"unfair\\", and \\"wrong\\". Corker and Cardin sent Obama a letter saying the bilateral IAEA-Iran document should be available for Congress to review. At the hearing Kerry, Lew, and Moniz \\"were unequivocal in their statements that the accord was the best that could be achieved and that without it, the international sanctions regime would collapse\\". Kerry warned that the United States would be \\"on our own\\" if it walked away from a multilateral agreement alongside the five global powers and added that the belief that \\"some sort of unicorn arrangement involving Iran's complete capitulation\\" could be achieved was \\"a fantasy, plain and simple\\". The Washington Post reported, \\"Moniz emerged as the calm center of the proceedings, beginning his interjections with recitations of what he described as 'facts,' and mildly observing that Republican characterizations were 'incorrect.'\\" Kerry, Lew, and Moniz faced \\"uniform animus of Republicans\\" at the hearing, with Republican senators giving \\"long and often scathing speeches denouncing what they described as a fatally flawed agreement and accusing the administration of dangerous naivete\\" and showing \\"little interest in responses\\" from the three cabinet secretaries. The Washington Post reported on twelve issues related to the agreement over which the two sides disagreed at the hearing. On 28 July Kerry, Moniz, and Lew testified before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Committee chairman Ed Royce, Republican of California, said in his opening statement, \\"we are being asked to consider an agreement that gives Iran permanent sanctions relief for temporary nuclear restrictions.\\" \\"Royce also said the inspection regime 'came up short' from 'anywhere, anytime' access to Iran's nuclear facilities and criticized the removal of restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile program and conventional arms.\\" The committee's ranking member, Representative Eliot Engel, Democrat of New York, said he has \\"serious questions and concerns\\" about the agreement. Kerry, Lew, and Moniz spent four hours testifying before the committee.Jennifer Steinhauer, \\"Iran Nuclear Deal Gets Support of House Israel Backer, Sander Levin\\" (28 July 2015).\\"Iran Nuclear Agreement: The Administration's Case\\" (video of Secretary Kerry's opening remarks before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on 28 July 2015). At the hearing Kerry said that if Congress killed the deal, \\"You'll not only be giving Iran a free pass to double the pace of its uranium enrichment, to build a heavy-water reactor, to install new and more efficient centrifuges, but they will do it all without the unprecedented inspection and transparency measures that we have secured. Everything that we have tried to prevent will now happen.\\"Carol Morello, \\"House panel grills administration officials about Iran deal\\", The Washington Post (28 July 2015). Senators John McCain (Republican of Arizona), the committee chair, and Jack Reed (Democrat of Rhode Island), the committee ranking member, at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee on the JCPOA, 29 July 2015. On 29 July Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Kerry, Moniz, and Lew appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee in a three-hour hearing.Helene Cooper, \\"Nuclear Deal Reduces Risk of Conflict With Iran, Top U.S. General Says\\", The New York Times (29 July 2015). Carter and Dempsey had been invited to testify by Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the committee; Kerry, Moniz, and Lew attended the hearing at the invitation of the Pentagon. In his opening statement McCain said that if the agreement failed and U.S. armed forces were called to take action against Iran, they \\"could be at greater risk because of this agreement\\". He also asserted that the agreement could lead American allies and partners to fateful decisions and result in \\"growing regional security competition, new arms races, nuclear proliferation, and possibly conflict\\". The committee's ranking Democratic member, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, said Congress had an obligation \\"to independently validate that the agreement will meet our common goal of stopping Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon\\" and that \\"the agreement, no matter your position on it, is historic and, if implemented scrupulously, could serve as a strategic inflection point in the world's relations with Iran, for international non-proliferation efforts, and for the political and security dynamics in the Middle East.\\"\\"Opening Statement by Ranking Member Jack Reed, SASC Hearing on Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\\" (29 July 2015). Carter said the agreement prevented Iran from \\"getting a nuclear weapon in a comprehensive and verifiable way\\". He assured the committee that the deal would not limit the U.S. ability to respond with military force if needed. In response to a question from McCain, Carter said he had \\"no reason to foresee\\" that the agreement would cause Iran's threatening behavior to change more broadly, stating \\"That is why it's important that Iran not have a nuclear weapon.\\"Tom Bowman, \\"Senate Republicans Raise Concerns About Lifting Iran Economic Sanctions\\", NPR (29 July 2015). Dempsey offered what he described as a \\"pragmatic\\" view. He neither praised nor criticized the deal, but testified that the agreement reduced the chances of a near-term military conflict between the United States and Iran. Dempsey said the agreement worked to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons but did not address other concerns about Iran's malign activities in the region, ranging from \\"ballistic missile technology to weapons trafficking, to ... malicious activity in cyberspace\\".Michael Bowman, \\"US Lawmakers Seek Details of Iran Nuke Inspection Regime\\", Voice of America (29 July 2015). He testified, \\"Ultimately, time and Iranian behavior will determine if the nuclear agreement is effective and sustainable\\" and stated that he would continue to provide military options to the president. Senator Joni Ernst expressed disagreement with Obama's statement that the choice was the Iran nuclear deal or war. When Dempsey testified that the United States had \\"a range of options\\" he had presented to Obama, Ernst said: \\"it's imperative everybody on the panel understand that there are other options available.\\"\\"Dempsey: 'We Have a Range of Options' Between Iran Deal and War\\" (video of General Dempsey's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on 29 July 2015).

Following this briefing with Amano, Corker told reporters: \\"The majority of members here left with far more questions than they had before the meeting took place\\" and \\"We can not get him to even confirm that we will have physical access inside of Parchin.\\" Cardin told reporters: \\"I thought today was helpful, but it was not a substitute for seeing the document.\\" State Department spokesman John Kirby responded, \\"There's no secret deals between Iran and the IAEA that the P5+1 has not been briefed on in detail\\" and stated \\"These kinds of technical arrangements with the IAEA are a matter of standard practice, that they're not released publicly or to other states, but our experts are familiar and comfortable with the contents, which we would be happy to discuss with Congress in a classified setting.\\" The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation wrote, \\"The arrangement specifies procedural information regarding how the IAEA will conduct its investigation into Iran's past nuclear history, including mentioning the names of informants who will be interviewed. Releasing this information would place those informants, and the information they hold, at risk.\\" Mark Hibbs of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Thomas Shea, a former IAEA safeguards official and former head of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Programs at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, wrote that the charges of a \\"secret side deal\\" made by opponents of the agreement were a \\"manufactured controversy\\". Hibbs and Shea wrote, \\"The IAEA has safeguards agreement with 180 countries. All have similar information protection provisions. Without these, governments would not open their nuclear programs for multilateral oversight. So IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano was acting by the book on August 5 when he told members of Congress that he couldn't share with them the details of [the] verification protocol the IAEA had negotiated with Iran as part of a bilateral 'roadmap.'\\" David Albright, founder and president of the Institute for Science and International Security and a former IAEA nuclear inspector, stated that the demands for greater transparency regarding the agreement between Iran and IAEA \\"aren't unreasonable\\" and \\"Iran is a big screamer for more confidentiality. Nonetheless, if the IAEA wanted to make it more open, it could.\\" Albright also proposed that the United States \\"should clearly and publicly confirm, and Congress should support with legislation, that if Iran does not address the IAEA's concerns about the past military dimensions of its nuclear programs, U.S. sanctions will not be lifted\\". Congressional support and opposition Republican leaders vowed to attempt to kill the agreement as soon as it was released, even before classified sections were made available to Congress, and \\"Republican lawmakers raced to send out news releases criticizing it.\\"Jennifer Steinhauer, \\"Republicans Have Minds Made Up as Debate Begins on Iran Nuclear Deal\\", The New York Times (23 July 2015). According to The Washington Post, \\"most congressional Republicans remained deeply skeptical, some openly scornful, of the prospect of relieving economic sanctions while leaving any Iranian uranium-enrichment capability intact.\\" Mitch McConnell said the deal \\"appears to fall well short of the goal we all thought was trying to be achieved, which was that Iran would not be a nuclear state\\". A New York Times analysis stated that Republican opposition to the agreement \\"seems born of genuine distaste for the deal's details, inherent distrust of President Obama, intense loyalty to Israel and an expansive view of the role that sanctions have played beyond preventing Iran's nuclear abilities\\". The Washington Post identified 12 issues related to the agreement on which the two sides disagreed, including the efficacy of inspections at undeclared sites; the effectiveness of the snapback sanctions; the significance of limits on enrichment; the significance of IAEA side agreements; the effectiveness of inspections of military sites; the consequences of walking away from an agreement; and the effects of lifting sanctions. One area of disagreement between supporters and opponents of the JCPOA is the consequences of walking away from an agreement, and whether renegotiation of the agreement is a realistic option. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, an opponent of the agreement, called for the U.S. government to keep sanctions in place, strengthen them, and \\"pursue the hard- trodden path of diplomacy once more, difficult as it may be\\". Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said that he believed that it was \\"hyperbole\\" to say that the agreement was the only alternative to war. President Obama, by contrast, argued that renegotiation of the deal is unrealistic, stating in his American University speech, \\"the notion that there is a better deal to be had. ... relies on vague promises of toughness\\" and stated, \\"Those making this argument are either ignorant of Iranian society, or they are not being straight with the American people. ... Neither the Iranian government, or the Iranian opposition, or the Iranian people would agree to what they would view as a total surrender of their sovereignty.\\" Obama also argued, \\"those who say we can just walk away from this deal and maintain sanctions are selling a fantasy. Instead of strengthening our position, as some have suggested, Congress' rejection would almost certainly result in multi-lateral sanctions unraveling,\\" because \\"our closest allies in Europe or in Asia, much less China or Russia, certainly are not going to enforce existing sanctions for another five, 10, 15 years according to the dictates of the U.S. Congress because their willingness to support sanctions in the first place was based on Iran ending its pursuit of nuclear weapons. It was not based on the belief that Iran cannot have peaceful nuclear power.\\" Secretary of State Kerry echoed these remarks, saying in July 2015 that the idea of a \\"'better deal,' some sort of unicorn arrangement involving Iran's complete capitulation . ... is a fantasy, plain and simple, and our intelligence community will tell you that\\".See also Lucy Westcott, \\"With an Eye on Congress, Kerry Says There Is No Better Iran Deal\\", Newsweek (11 August 2015) (Kerry: \\"When I hear a senator or a congressman stand up and say, 'Well, we should get a better deal,' that is not going to happen. There isn't a 'better deal' to be gotten. You can't just sit there and say, 'I say no, let's not do this deal, we'll just go get a better one' and not take into account the history of the road that has been traveled.\\"). Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, a supporter of the agreement, wrote: \\"Some say that, should the Senate reject this agreement, we would be in position to negotiate a \\"better\\" one. But I've spoken to representatives of the five nations that helped broker the deal, and they agree that this simply wouldn't be the case.\\"Al Franken, \\"Why I support Iran deal\\", CNN (13 August 2015). On 28 July 2015 Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, the longest-serving Jewish member now in Congress, announced in a lengthy statement that he would support the JCPOA, saying, \\"the agreement is the best way\\" to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and that a rejection of the agreement would lead the international sanctions regime to \\"quickly fall apart\\", as \\"sanctions likely would not be continued even by our closest allies, and the United States would be isolated trying to enforce our unilateral sanctions as to Iran's banking and oil sectors.\\"\\"Levin Statement on the Iran Nuclear Agreement\\" (28 July 2015).Melissa Nann Burke & David Shepardson, \\"Rep.

Cardin took a phone call from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu opposing the agreement and participated in a private 90-minute session with Energy Secretary Moniz supporting the agreement. On 21 July Cardin said that if the agreement is implemented, the United States should increase military aid to Israel and friendly Gulf states. On 4 August 2015 three key and closely watched Senate Democrats‚ÄîTim Kaine of Virginia (a Foreign Relations Committee member), Barbara Boxer of California (also a Foreign Relations Committee member), and Bill Nelson of Florida‚Äîannounced their support for the agreement.Mike DeBonis, \\"Three Senate Democrats came off of the fence to support the Iran deal\\", The Washington Post (4 August 2015). In a floor speech that day, Kaine said that the agreement is \\"far preferable to any other alternative, including war\\" and, \\"America has honored its best traditions and shown that patient diplomacy can achieve what isolation and hostility cannot.\\" In a similar floor speech the same day, Nelson said, \\"I am convinced [that the agreement] will stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon for at least the next 10 to 15 years.

Charles Schumer announces opposition to nuclear pact with Iran\\", The Washington Post (6 August 2015). According to an Associated Press report, the classified assessment of the United States Intelligence Community on the agreement concludes that because Iran will be required by the agreement to provide international inspectors with \\"unprecedented volume of information about nearly every aspect of its existing nuclear program\\", Iran's ability to conceal a covert weapons program will be diminished.Ken Dilanian, \\"US officials say they can tell if Iran is cheating on deal\\", Associated Press (12 August 2015).Karoun Demirjian, \\"House Dems pounce on intel assessment of Iran deal\\", The Washington Post (13 August 2015). In a 13 August letter to colleagues, ten current and former Democratic members of the House Select Committee on Intelligence (including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff) referred to this assessment as a reason to support the agreement, writing, \\"We are confident that this monitoring and the highly intrusive inspections provided for in the agreement‚Äîalong with our own intelligence capabilities‚Äîmake it nearly impossible for Iran to develop a covert enrichment effort without detection.\\"\\"Current and Former House Intelligence Committee Members Urge Colleagues to Review Intelligence Community Assessments of Iran Nuclear Deal\\" , United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Democratic Office (13 August 2015). The ten members also wrote \\"You need not take our word for it\\" and referred members to the classified assessment itself, which is located in an office in the Capitol basement and is available for members of Congress to read. Congressional votes A resolution of disapproval was initially expected to pass both the House and Senate, meaning, \\"the real challenge for the White House is whether they can marshal enough Democrats to sustain the veto.\\"Julie Hirschfeld Davis, \\"Lobbying Fight Over Iran Nuclear Deal Centers on Democrats\\", The New York Times (17 August 2015). Two-thirds of both houses (the House of Representatives and the Senate) are required to override a veto, meaning that one-third of either house (146 votes in the House, or 34 in the Senate) could sustain (uphold) President Obama's veto of a resolution of disapproval.Amber Phillips, \\"Whip count: Where the Senate stands on the Iran deal\\", The Washington Post (5 August 2015).Lauren French, \\"Liberals poised to give Barack Obama a win on Iran\\", Politico (13 August 2015). By early September 2015, 34 senators had publicly confirmed support for the deal, a crucial threshold because it ensured that the Senate could sustain (i.e., uphold) any veto of a resolution of disapproval.Amber Phillips, \\"President Obama's Iran deal nears a major symbolic victory\\", The Washington Post (8 September 2015). Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland announced support on 2 September, a day after Chris Coons of Delaware and Bob Casey, Jr. of Pennsylvania also announced support, reaching 34 votes and assuring that an eventual disapproval resolution passed in the Senate could not override an Obama veto. By the following day 38 Democratic senators supported the deal, 3 were opposed, and 5 were still undecided. By 8 September, all senators had made a commitment on the agreement, with 42 in support (40 Democrats and two independents) and 58 opposed (54 Republicans and four Democrats). It was possible for senators in support of the agreement to kill the disapproval resolution outright in the Senate by effectively filibustering it, making it unnecessary for Obama to veto a disapproval resolution at all. But this was possible only if at least 41 voted to do so, and several senators in support of the agreement, including Coons, \\"have suggested they'd prefer an up-or-down vote on the deal instead of blocking it altogether\\". The apparent success of a strategy to marshal congressional support for the deal, linked to a carefully orchestrated rollout of endorsements (although Democratic Senate Whip Dick Durbin and other officials disputed the suggestion of coordination) was attributed to lessons the White House and congressional Democrats learned during struggles in previous summers with Republicans, in particular over Obamacare. An August 2015 meeting at which top diplomats from the UK, Russia, China, Germany, and France told 10 undecided Democratic senators they had no intention of returning to the negotiating table was reported to be particularly crucial. Coons said: \\"They were clear and strong that we will not join you in re-imposing sanctions.\\" On 20 August 2015 Pelosi said that House Democrats had the votes to uphold a veto of a resolution of disapproval.Sabrina Siddiqui, \\"Congress does not have votes to block Iran deal, says Nancy Pelosi\\", The Guardian (20 August 2015). To sustain a veto she would need to hold only 146 of the 188 House Democrats;Ryan Grim & Laura Barron-Lopez, \\"Nancy Pelosi May Save The Iran Negotiations For Obama\\", The Huffington Post (14 April 2015). by 20 August, about 60 House Democrats had publicly declared their support for the final agreement,Erica Werner, \\"Pelosi: House Democrats will sustain Obama veto on Iran deal\\", Associated Press (20 August 2015). and about 12 had publicly declared their opposition. In May 2015, before the final agreement was announced, 151 House Democrats signed in support for the broad outlines in the April framework agreement; none of those signatories have announced opposition to the final agreement. It was originally expected that the House would vote on a formal resolution of disapproval introduced by Representative Ed Royce, Republican of California, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Kristina Peterson, \\"GOP Leaders Back Vote to Disapprove of Iran Nuclear Deal\\" The Wall Street Journal (4 August 2015). As the Senate moved toward a vote on a resolution of disapproval, House leadership (under Republican control) planned to vote on a similar resolution of disapproval. But conservative Republicans \\"revolted in protest\\" as \\"the chamber's right flank wanted tougher action from its leader\\" and the House Republican leadership (under Speaker John Boehner) planned to vote instead chose to bring a resolution of approval to the floor \\"as a way to effectively force Democrats who had voiced support for the president to formally register such endorsement\\". On 11 September 2015 the resolution failed, as expected, on a 162-269 vote; 244 Republicans and 25 Democrats voted no, while 162 Democrats and no Republicans voted yes.\\"Final Vote Results for Roll Call 493\\" (11 September 2015), Office of the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives.

The former resolution passed on a party-line vote, with all Republicans in favor and all Democrats opposed; the latter resolution passed on nearly a party-line vote, with all Republicans and two Democrats in favor and every other Democrat opposed.\\"Final Vote Results for Roll Call 492\\" and \\"Final Vote Results for Roll Call 494\\" (11 September 2015), Office of the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives. The House action against the resolution was a \\"symbolic vote that will have no consequence for the implementation of the deal\\", and the two anti-agreement measures passed by the House were seen as \\"unlikely to even reach Obama's desk\\". On 10 September, the day before the vote, Boehner threatened to \\"use every tool at our disposal to stop, slow and delay this agreement from being fully implemented\\" and said that a lawsuit by House Republicans against the president (claiming that the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act was not followed) was \\"an option that is very possible\\".Karoun Demirjian & Kelsey Snell, \\"House conservatives may end up in court to kill Iran deal\\", The Washington Post (10 September 2015).

On 21 June 2015, the Iranian Parliament (Majlis) decided to form a committee to study the JCPOA and to wait at least 80 days before voting on it.Thomas Erdbrink, \\"Iran Lawmakers to Wait 80 Days Before Voting on Nuclear Deal\\", The New York Times (21 July 2015). Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Atomic Energy Organization of Iran chief Ali Akbar Salehi, defended the deal in Parliament on the same day. Although the Iranian constitution gives Parliament the right to cancel the deal, it was reported that this outcome is unlikely. The New York Times reported, \\"the legislators have effectively opted to withhold their judgment until they know whether the American Congress approves of the deal.\\" In televised remarks made on 23 July 2015, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani rejected domestic criticism of the JCPOA from Iranian hardliners, \\"such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its allies\\", which \\"have criticized the accord as an invasive affront to the country's sovereignty and a capitulation to foreign adversaries, particularly the United States\\".Thomas Erdbrink & Rock Gladstone, \\"Iran's President Defends Nuclear Deal in Blunt Remarks\\", The New York Times (23 July 2015). In remarks described by The New York Times as \\"blunt\\" and uncharacteristically frank, Rouhani claimed a popular mandate to make an agreement based on his election in 2013 and warned that the alternative was \\"an economic Stone Age\\" brought on by sanctions which (as the Times described) have \\"shriveled oil exports and denied the country access to the global banking system\\". On 26 July, a two-page, top-secret directive sent to Iranian newspaper editors from Iran's Supreme National Security Council surfaced online.Kasra Naji, \\"Iran nuclear: Media ordered to be positive about deal\\", BBC Persian (26 July 2015). In the document, newspapers are instructed to avoid criticism of the agreement and to avoid giving the impression of \\"a rift\\" at the highest levels of government. The BBC reported that the document appears to be aimed at constraining criticism of the JCPOA by Iranian hardliners. On 3 September, Iranian supreme leader Khamenei said that the Majlis should make the final decision on the agreement.Jay Solomon, \\"Iran Leaders Say Parliament Will Have Final Say on Fate of Nuclear Deal\\", The Wall Street Journal (3 September 2015). On the same day, Ali Larijani, the speaker of the parliament, said that he support the agreement and that: \\"The agreement needs to be discussed and needs to be approved by the Iranian parliament. There will be heated discussions and debates.\\" Abbas Milani and Michael McFaul wrote: \\"those [in Iran] supporting the deal include moderates inside the government, many opposition leaders, a majority of Iranian citizens, and many in the Iranian American diaspora‚Äîa disparate group that has rarely agreed on anything until now.\\"Abbas Milani & Michael McFaul, \\"What the Iran-Deal Debate Is Like in Iran\\", The Atlantic (11 August 2015). Within the government, Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, who negotiated the agreement, \\"are now the most vocal in defending it against Iranian hawks\\". Also vocally supporting the agreement are former presidents Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami and moderates within parliament. The agreement is also supported by most prominent opposition leaders, including Mir-Hossein Mousavi, a 2009 presidential candidate who is under house arrest for his role as a leader of the Green Movement. Conversely, \\"the most militantly authoritarian, conservative, and anti-Western leaders and groups within Iran oppose the deal.\\" The anti-agreement coalition in Iran includes former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, former head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Fereydoon Abbasi, ex-nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili; and various conservative clerics and Revolutionary Guard commanders. This group has \\"issued blistering attacks on the incompetence of Iran's negotiating team, claiming that negotiators caved on many key issues and were outmaneuvered by more clever and sinister American diplomats\\". Anti-JCPOA representatives of Islamic Consultative Assembly protested Ali Akbar Saheli and made death threats toward him\\"Nuclear chief says was threatened with death\\" Iran Daily Iranian defense minister Hossein Dehqan said on 2 September that Iran would not allow the IAEA to visit every site or facility that it wishes.\\"DM: Iran Not to Allow IAEA to Inspect Every Site\\" Fars News Service, 2 September 2015 The Majlis special commission for examining the JCPOA, has invited Ali Shamkhani, as well as members of former nuclear negotiation team including Ali Bagheri and Fereydoon Abbasi to comment on the deal. During the session, Saeed Jalili, ex-chief negotiator has slammed the deal, stating \\"approximately 100 absolute rights\\" of Iran were conceded to the opposing side. He believes the deal is \\"unacceptable\\" because Iran makes an \\"exceptional [nuclear case], replacing 'permission' with 'right' under the NPT, and accepting unconventional measures\\". He also believes that the deal has crossed the red lines drawn by the Supreme leader of Iran. His testimony was criticized by commission members Masoud Pezeshkian and Abbas Ali Mansouri Arani. In another session, current negotiatiors Abbas Araqchi and Majid Takht-Ravanchi defended the deal, led by Javad Zarif. In the Iranian media, the leading reformist newspapers, Etemad and Shargh, \\"continue to write approvingly of the negotiations and their outcome\\".Tara Kangarlou, \\"Tehran's debate over nuclear pact mirrors Washington's\\", Al-Jazeera (13 August 2015). Conversely, the leading conservative paper Ettelaat has criticized the agreement. The most \\"bombastic and hard-line criticism of the deal\\" has come from Kayhan, which is edited by Hossein Shariatmadari and closely associated with Khamenei, the supreme leader. The agreement is supported by many Iranian dissidents, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate, human rights activist, and Iranian exile Shirin Ebadi, who \\"labeled as 'extremists' those who opposed the agreement in Iran and America\\". Likewise, dissident journalist and former political prisoner Akbar Ganji expressed hope, \\"step-by-step nuclear accords, the lifting of economic sanctions and the improvement of the relations between Iran and Western powers will gradually remove the warlike and securitized environment from Iran.\\" Citing Iran's human rights situation and the \\"lack of religious and political freedom in the country\\", some dissidents opposed the agreement, including Ahmad Batebi, Nazanin Afshin-Jam, and Roozbeh Farahanipour, who signed an open letter arguing, \\"more pressure should be applied to the regime, not less.\\"\\"Iranian Dissidents Against the Iran Deal\\", The Daily Beast (14 August 2015). On 13 October The New York Times and many other major U.S. news sources reported that the Iranian Parliament had approved the JPCOA with 161 votes in favor, 59 against and 13 abstentions. Major Iranian news sources including Fars News Agency and Press TV, called a semi-official government source by U.S. media, reported that what was actually approved was a document consisting of the text of the JPCOA supplemented by text unilaterally added by Iran and not agreed to by the P5+1. ===Adoption Day=== On 18 October 2015 EU High Representative Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif jointly announced \\"Adoption Day\\" for the JCPOA, noting actions taken and planned by the EU, Iran, the IAEA, and the United States, and stating, \\"All sides remain strongly committed to ensuring that implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action can start as soon as possible.\\"\\"Joint Statement by EU High Representative Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif\\", Brussels, 18 October 2015. On 20 September 2015, Director-General Yukiya Amano of the IAEA went to the Parchin missile production facility, along with Director of Safeguards Tero Varjoranta, to obtain clarifications on the nuclear activities of the site. The next day, Amano professed satisfaction with the samples taken by the Iranians themselves and handed over to the IAEA under \\"established procedures\\". IAEA experts were not physically present during the sampling, but Amano said the procedure meets \\"strict agency criteria\\" that ensure \\"the integrity of the sampling process and the authenticity of the samples.\\" In June 2016, IAEA investigators reported to the Wall Street Journal that they had reported in December 2015 traces of uranium found at the Parchin facility. ===Implementation Day=== Last meeting between diplomatic teams of Iran and the United States, at the Palais Coburg Hotel in Vienna After the IAEA confirmed that Iran met the relevant requirements under the JCPOA, all nuclear sanctions were lifted by the UN, the EU and the United States on 16 January 2016. Washington imposed new sanctions on 11 companies and individuals for supplying Iran's ballistic missile program on the first day of the implementation. According to Kerry, $1.7 billion in debt with interest was to be paid to Tehran. But some Iranian financial institutions, including Ansar Bank, Bank Saderat, Bank Saderat PLC, and Mehr Bank, remained on the SDN List and a number of U.S. sanctions with respect to Iran, including existing terrorism, human rights and ballistic missiles-related sanctions, remained in place. ===Breach of uranium enrichment limit=== On 8 May 2019, Iran announced it would suspend implementation of some parts of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, threatening further action in 60 days unless it received protection from U.S. sanctions. On 7 July 2019 Iran announced that it had started to increase uranium enrichment beyond the agreed 3.67% limit. On the same day the IAEA stated its inspectors would verify Iran's announcement. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif sent a letter to his European counterpart Federica Mogherini notifying her about Iran's non-compliance. On 4 November 2019, Iran doubled the number of advanced centrifuges it operates. Iran is also enriching uranium to 4.5%; the agreement limits enrichment to 3.67%. On 5 November 2019, Iranian nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi announced that Iran will enrich uranium to 5% at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, adding that it had the capability to enrich uranium to 20% if needed. ==Deterring Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons== Some argue that deterrence is the key to ensuring not just that Iran is in compliance with the agreement but also to preventing them from developing nuclear weapons. Former Assistant Secretary for Nonproliferation Robert Einhorn, a supporter of the agreement, wrote it would be better to have permanent or longer-term restrictions on Iran's enrichment program, but preventing a nuclear-armed Iran is possible, \\"provided the United States and key partners maintain a strong and credible deterrent against a future Iranian decision to go for the bomb\\". According to Michael Eisenstadt, Director of the Military and Security Studies Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, \\"deterring Iran from developing or acquiring nuclear weapons will remain the core imperative driving U.S. policy in the coming years\\". Four days after the JCPOA was adopted, Khamenei delivered a speech, highlighting his fatwa and rejecting the claim that the nuclear talks rather than Iran's religious abstinence prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. He said: In a letter addressed to Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, President Obama raised the issue about U.S. ability to deter Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons: Ambassador Dennis Ross, former top Mideast official, and General David Petraeus, former CIA director, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed, \\"Bolstering deterrence is essential in addressing key vulnerabilities\\" of the agreement. Petraeus and Ross asserted that if Iran decide to race toward a nuclear weapon \\"there is a need not to speak of our options but of our readiness to use force\\", since the threat of force is far more likely to deter the Iranians. They said the president could resolve their concerns by stating that he would use military force to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, including producing highly enriched uranium, even after the deal ends in 15 years. It is \\"critically important for the president to state this clearly, particularly given his perceived hesitancy to use force\\", they said. In the same letter, Obama detailed the possible non- military unilateral and multilateral responses to be employed should Iran violate the agreement, however, the president made it clear: \\"Ultimately, it is essential that we retain the flexibility to decide what responsive measures we and our allies deem appropriate for any non-compliance.\\" Flexibility meant that Obama rejected specifying \\"the penalties for smaller violations of the accord\\" in advance. The open letter, which was signed by more than 100 former U.S. ambassadors and high-ranking State Department officials endorsing the agreement, begins with the words: \\"The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran stands as a landmark agreement in deterring the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\\" In contrast, Michael Mandelbaum, the Christian A. Herter Professor at the Johns Hopkins University, School of Advanced International Studies, wrote that nuclear nonproliferation in the Middle East ultimately depended \\"not on the details of the Vienna agreement but on the familiar Cold-War policy of deterrence\\". Mandelbaum added that if Obama left office without Iran building the bomb, \\"the responsibility for conducting a policy of effective deterrence will fall on his successor.\\" Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz said, \\"Nothing currently on the table will deter Iran. Sanctions are paper protests to an oil-rich nation. Diplomacy has already failed because Russia and China are playing both sides.\\" See also \\"Excerpt from 'The Case Against the Iran Deal'\\", The Times of Israel blogs. ==Aftermath== In May 2019 the IAEA certified that Iran was abiding by the main terms of the deal, although questions were raised on certified that how many advanced centrifuges Iran was allowed to have, as that was only loosely defined in the deal. ==Legal status== In a letter sent to then U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo, the U.S. State Department said that the JCPOA \\"is not a treaty or an executive agreement, and is not a signed document\\". According to the Congressional Research Service, different definitions of \\"treaty\\" are used in international law and in domestic U.S. law. Under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, \\"The term 'treaty' has a broader meaning under international law than under domestic law. Under international law, 'treaty' refers to any binding international agreement.\\"Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\\". United Nations. Article 1(a). May 23, 1969. Under domestic U.S. law, 'treaty' signifies only those binding international agreements that have received the advice and consent of the Senate.\\" ==Denial of recertification== The United States certified in April 2017 and in July 2017 that Iran was complying with the deal. On 13 October 2017 President Trump announced that he would not make the certification required under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, accusing Iran of violating the \\"spirit\\" of the deal and calling on the U.S. Congress and international partners to \\"address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons\\". Declaring that he would not certify the deal, Trump left it up to Congress whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran and \\"blow up\\" the deal. But Trump's aides sought to enact rules indicating how the United States could \\"reimpose sanctions\\", and Trump listed three items that could provide such a \\"trigger\\" for leaving the deal: Iran's intercontinental ballistic missile, Iranian rejection of \\"an extension of the deal's existing constraint on its nuclear activities\\", and \\"evidence that Iran could manufacture a bomb in less than 12 months\\". Trump described the deal as \\"one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into\\". Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that getting out from the Iran nuclear deal would \\"carry a high cost\\" for the United States, and that no president was allowed to \\"single-handedly revoke\\" the deal signed by the UN. After Trump said that he \\"cannot and will not\\" recertify the nuclear deal with Iran, Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel supported the deal in a joint statement. Mogherini, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said that the agreement was working well and that no one country could break the deal made by Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union. She suggested a \\"collective process\\" for keeping the deal. Russia's foreign minister confirmed that Iran was abiding by the deal. ===US withdrawal=== Trump announces US withdrawal on 8 May. On 8 May 2018 the United States officially withdrew from the agreement after US President Donald Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum ordering the reinstatement of harsher sanctions.. In his 8 May speech President Trump called the Iran deal \\"horrible\\" and said the United States would \\"work with our allies to find a real, comprehensive, and lasting solution\\" to prevent Iran from developing nuclear arms. The IAEA has continued to assess that Iran has been in compliance with JCPOA and that it had \\"no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009\\" Other parties to the deal stated that they will work to preserve the deal even after the US withdrawal. Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Mick Mulroy said the U.S. Department of Defense opposed withdrawal from the JCPOA, because although it wasn't perfect, it was the best they could expect. He also said the U.S. should have kept the agreement on nuclear activity and come up with another agreement on malign activity. ===Consequences of US withdrawal=== The Iranian currency dropped significantly right after Trump announced the US withdrawal. The leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stated: \\"I said from the first day: don't trust America\\". The American flag was set on fire in Iran's Parliament. The next evening, 9 May, according to IDF sources, Iranian Revolutionary Guard Quds Forces based in Syria launched rockets at Israeli military targets. Reporters for CNN said that, \\"if confirmed,\\" it appears to be \\"the first time Iranian forces have fired rockets directly at Israeli forces.\\" In 2020, Trump and Pompeo asserted that the United States remained a \\"participant\\" in the agreement, despite having formally withdrawn in 2018, in an effort to persuade the United Nations Security Council to reimpose pre- agreement sanctions on Iran for its breaches of the deal after the United States' withdrawal. The agreement provided for a resolution process among signatories in the event of a breach, but that process had not yet played out. ===Ali Khamenei's conditions for Europe to preserve the JCPOA=== Following the U.S. withdrawal from JCPOA, Iran supreme leader Ali Khamenei presented seven conditions for Europe to meet its commitments. Among them was that European powers must take steps to preserve business relations with Iranian banks and purchase Iranian oil despite U.S. pressure. He also said there was no need to hold new discussions about Iran's ballistic missile program and regional activities. ===Iran's response === One year after the United States withdrew from the JCPOA and reimposed several unilateral sanctions on Iran, Iran took countermeasures. As a first step, according to Rouhani, Iran halted sales of excess enriched uranium and heavy water to other countries. Rouhani also said that Iran would resume enrichment of uranium beyond 3.67 percent if other parties could not fulfill their duties to let Iran benefit from the economic advantages of the JCPOA. Iran made this decision after all major European companies abandoned doing business with Iran out of fear of US punishment. On 14 May 2019, in a meeting with senior officials, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, described negotiations with the United States on another nuclear deal as \\"poison\\" and said, \\"We don‚Äôt seek a war, and they don‚Äôt either. They know it‚Äôs not in their interests\\". ==See also== * Iran nuclear deal framework * Begin Doctrine (The common term for the Israeli government's preventive strike to the potential enemies' capability to possess WMD) * Black Cube (a private intelligence company founded by former Israeli intelligence officers) * Iran and Libya Sanctions Act * United States national emergency with respect to Iran * 2016 U.S.‚ÄìIran naval incident == Notes References * \\"Joint statement by EU High Representative Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif\\" at the European External Action Service (EEAS) * Full text of the agreement: ** Via EEAS: *** \\"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\\" *** \\"Annex I: Nuclear-related commitments\\" *** \\"Annex II: Sanctions-related commitments\\" **** \\"Attachments to Annex II\\" *** \\"Annex III: Civil nuclear cooperation\\" *** \\"Annex IV: Joint Commission\\" *** \\"Annex V: Implementation Plan\\" ** ; Videos * Iran Nuclear Deal Progress Report ‚Äì Nuclear Threat Initiative (2017) * \\"The Iran Nuclear Deal Explained\\" ‚Äì The Wall Street Journal (2015) Category:2015 documents Category:2010s in Vienna Category:2015 in Austria Category:2015 in international relations Category:2015 in Iran Category:2016 in Iran Category:2015 controversies Category:2016 controversies Category:July 2015 events in Europe Category:Agreements Category:Diplomatic conferences in Austria Category:Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration Category:Obama administration controversies Category:Presidency of Hassan Rouhani Category:John Kerry Category:Middle East peace efforts Category:Nuclear energy in Iran Category:Nuclear program of Iran Category:Nuclear weapons policy Category:Foreign relations of Iran Category:Foreign relations of China Category:Iran‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:China‚ÄìIran relations Category:Iran‚ÄìRussia relations Category:United States‚ÄìEuropean Union relations Category:China‚ÄìEuropean Union relations Category:Iran‚ÄìEuropean Union relations Category:Russia‚ÄìEuropean Union relations Category:Treaties entered into by the European Union Category:Treaties of Iran Category:Treaties of China Category:Treaties of Russia Category:Treaties of the United States ","title":"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action"},{"id":"42015125","text":"is a Japanese physician-scientist and immunologist. He shared the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and is best known for his identification of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). He is also known for his molecular identification of cytokines: IL-4 and IL-5, as well as the discovery of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) that is essential for class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. He was elected as a foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States (2001), as a member of German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina (2003), and also as a member of the Japan Academy (2005). In 2018, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with James P. Allison. He and Allison together had won the 2014 Tang Prize in Biopharmaceutical Science for the same achievement. == Life and career == at Nobel press conference in Stockholm, December 2018 Honjo was born in Kyoto in 1942. He completed his M.D. degree in 1966 from the Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, where in 1975 he received his Ph.D. degree in Medical Chemistry under the supervision of Yasutomi Nishizuka and Osamu Hayaishi.\\" Honjo was a visiting fellow at the Department of Embryology, Carnegie Institution of Washington, from 1971 to 1973. He then moved to the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, where he studied the genetic basis for the immune response at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development as a fellow between 1973 and 1977, followed by many years as an NIH Fogarty Scholar in Residence starting in 1992. During part of this time, Honjo also was an assistant professor at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, between 1974 and 1979; a professor in the Department of Genetics, Osaka University School of Medicine, between 1979 and 1984; and professor in the Department of Medical Chemistry, Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine, from 1984 to 2005. Since 2005 Honjo has been a professor in Department of Immunology and Genomic Medicine, Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine. He was the President of Shizuoka Prefecture Public University Corporation from 2012 to 2017. He is a member of Japanese Society for Immunology and served as its President between 1999 and 2000. Honjo is also an honorary member of American Association of Immunologists. In 2017 he became Deputy Director-General and Distinguished Professor of Kyoto University Institute for Advanced Study (KUIAS). ===COVID-19 pandemic=== During the COVID-19 pandemic, a false claim that Honjo believed that the novel coronavirus had been \\"manufactured\\" by a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan was widely disseminated on the internet in many languages. The BBC Reality Check team reported that, \\"In a statement published on the website of Kyoto University, he said he was 'greatly saddened' that his name had been used to spread 'false accusations and misinformation'. Scientists say genome sequencing shows that the virus came from animals and was not man-made.\\" == Contribution == Cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation (CTLA4, PD1) Honjo has established the basic conceptual framework of class switch recombination. He presented a model explaining antibody gene rearrangement in class switch and, between 1980 and 1982, verified its validity by elucidating its DNA structure. He succeeded in cDNA clonings of IL-4 and IL-5 cytokines involved in class switching and IL-2 receptor alpha chain in 1986, and went on further to discover AID in 2000, demonstrating its importance in class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. In 1992, Honjo first identified PD-1 as an inducible gene on activated T-lymphocytes, and this discovery significantly contributed to the establishment of cancer immunotherapy principle by PD-1 blockade. == Awards == Shun'ichi Iwasaki, Ken Takakura, Seikaku Takagi, Susumu Nakanishi and Honjo received the Order of Culture from Emperor Akihito on November 3, 2013.

Leary stated that he would not star in the series, but would take a small role, if necessary, in the future. In 2012, the USA Network sought to rush the developing Sirens to pilot status. However, a deal with Fox Television Studios was carefully being studied over VOD rights. The network was able to order a series pilot in June 2012. The four lead roles were filled in October 2012, with the casting of Michael Mosley, Kevin Daniels, Kevin Bigley and Jessica McNamee. Production for the pilot began in Chicago that month. The network announced that Sirens would premiere in the first quarter of 2014 and would later state that two back-to-back episodes would air together on March 6, 2014, then resume normal programming the following week. At the January 2014 TCA conference, Leary and Fisher stated that the producers of the British series approached Leary's business partner, Jim Serpico, and asked him to adapt it for the U.S.. Leary stated, \\"We really liked those guys, and USA [network] was pillaging the cast of [the recently ended] Rescue Me and putting them into shows.\\" He added, \\"we can make some money off these USA people.\\" On June 11, 2014, USA ordered a 13-episode second season of Sirens. ==EpisodesSeason 1 (2014)=Season 2 (2015)=Critical reception== Sirens scored 61 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 19 \\"generally favorable\\" reviews.

He is best known for writing the 2013 coming-of-age film The Kings of Summer. == Early life == Galletta, who comes from an Italian background, grew up in Tottenville, Staten Island, New York, where he attended Tottenville High School. He graduated from the St. John's University College of Professional Studies; his major was in television and film studies. He later attended the Columbia University School of the Arts and graduated with a Master of Fine Arts in 2010. == Career == Galletta first worked in the entertainment industry on the Late Show with David Letterman where he was an intern. He worked on Letterman as a contributing writer for several years before he left to pursue writing film screenplays full-time. Galletta's first screenplay, Toy's House, was written as the thesis of his degree at Columbia University. In 2009, the script made the Black List, a survey of the best unproduced film screenplays, and was purchased by Big Beach Films the same week that the list was published, before Galletta had graduated from Columbia. The film was directed by Jordan Vogt- Roberts and renamed The Kings of Summer. It premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival to positive reviews. Elements of the screenplay are based on Galetta's experiences as a youth living on Staten Island, but the producers of the film changed the location to Chagrin Falls, Ohio, a move that Galetta endorsed for giving the story \\"an 'any town' type of feel.\\" Galletta has also managed to sell a pitch for a screenplay to New Line Cinema, which he described as \\"an action comedy set in Rio de Janeiro\\". The story was co- written with Todd Strauss-Schulson, who is also slated to direct the film, although Galletta was hired to write the script individually. == References  * Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:American male screenwriters Category:Writers from New York City Category:American people of Italian descent Category:St. John's University (New York City) alumni Category:Columbia University School of the Arts alumni Category:People from Staten Island Category:Screenwriters from New York (state) ","title":"Chris Galletta"},{"id":"42015201","text":"The House Of Wisdom For Conflict Resolution & Governance (HOW) is a think-tank that was created in May 2008.

The airplane has remained in Bolivia since 1961, when it was forced to land by the Bolivian Air Force after a chase in which an Air Force Captain died in a crash. The airplane has become a tourist attraction, having undergone several changes of ownership, and has also become an urban legend among Bolivians. ==The airplane== The airplane is a Lockheed Constellation with the registration N2520B, which at the time of the incident was registered to Lloyd Airlines of Miami, Florida (not to be confused with Lloyd Aereo Boliviano, the then flag-carrier of Bolivia). According to AeroTransport Data Bank the airplane was sold to a Brandon Anderson in 1958.AeroTransport Data Bank The airplane had previously flown for Braniff International Airways and Trans American Airlines before being acquired by the Empire Supply Company in 1960, months before the incident happened. A model airplane of this aircraft exists, as Corgi Toys released a model of the Constellation under Braniff livery. ==The fateful flight== During some time before N2520B's final flight, Constellations had been conducting night flights to El Trompillo Airport. Locals believe that these transported goods to Buenos Aires, Argentina and Arica, Chile, among other destinations, from the United States, such as cigarettes, textiles, whiskey, socks, television sets and contraband items. (in Spanish) On Saturday, 29 July 1961, the airplane landed at El Trompillo Airport, and rested there until 30 July, when it took off southward. The plane's occupants had not filed a flight plan; instead they said they were carrying a practice-only flight. Immediately after take-off, Trompillo control tower alerted the Fuerza Aerea Boliviana, which sent P-51 Mustang fighters to chase it. The P-51 pilots and the control tower asked the plane's crew to fly to Cochabamba, but the crew ignored the request. The P-51s then proceeded to shoot at the airplane, making the Constellation crew attempt an emergency landing at El Trompillo Airport. As the aircraft descended, the crew dived in a final attempt at getting the P-51's to call off their pursuit, causing one pilot, Captain Alberto Peredo C√©spedes, to crash fatally. The Constellation itself landed at El Trompillo, and the crew members were arrested on site. The aircraft's tires were blown up and the local military airline, TAM, flew soldiers in from Cochabamba to prevent the airport from being overtaken by guerrillas. (in Spanish) ==Crew trial== Following the incident, Bolivian President Victor Paz Estenssoro, ordered an investigation which yielded the arrest of 85 soldiers and dishonorable discharge of 130 more. Also arrested were pilots William Roy Robinson and William Friedman, co- pilot Salvatore Henrique Romano, flight engineer Bertrand Vinson and radio-man Gene Hawkins. The case and its investigation became known nationally in Bolivia as the caso Constellation. The four Americans and one Brazilian (Henrique Romano) were charged with homicide, piracy, violation of international laws and contraband. After being incarcerated at Pan√≥ptico de La Paz jail, three of them were given provisional freedom and two were admitted into a local hospital under the supervision of American vice-consul in Bolivia at the time, Samuel Karp. In November 1961, it was announced that the airplane's crew had escaped Bolivia. They were tried in absentia, and in 1967, the case's prosecutor asked for ten years of prison for each crew-member. Ultimately, none of the five men on the airplane returned to Bolivia and four of them remain at large. Pilot William Roy Robinson died on 1 April 2010, aged 90, and is buried in the family cemetery, San Mateo, Florida. ==Airplane's fate== On 25 August 1961, a local judge assigned a Bolivian Air Force Commander as keeper of the airplane and the contents that it had during its last flight, as compensation for the P-51 lost during the plane's chase. But the La Paz district's customs department prevented this from actually taking place, and the plane became the property of the FAB's Military Aviation College instead. In 1979, the airplane was moved to Boris Banzer Prada Park at Uruguay avenue in Santa Cruz from El Trompillo airport, as it was given to Santa Cruz's city hall, which decided to place it at barrio El Tao, where the park is located. (in Spanish) The plane was later transformed into a library, and it was later used as a Banco de Cr√©dito de Bolivia branch after having fallen into disrepair and being restored. It has been used for advertisement purposes by Pepsi and Aerosur, the now defunct major local airline. The airplane was reported by a television news show to be in disrepair late in 2014.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr5ixblKjKU ==References== Category:Airliner accidents and incidents with an unknown cause Category:Aviation in Bolivia Category:Urban legends Category:Lockheed aircraft Category:Cochabamba Category:Individual aircraft Category:July 1961 events ","title":"Avion Pirata"},{"id":"42015229","text":"Kreiner is a surname.

Built in 1873, the building is the oldest remaining city hall building in Madison County. While Bethalto was platted in 1854, the need for a village hall did not arise until the city incorporated as a village in 1873. The two-story brick building was designed in the Italianate style. The first floor of the building housed government offices, while the second floor had a meeting room used by the village's fraternal organizations and community groups. In 1938, the village built a fire station annex onto the building. The village government operated in the building until 1963. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 2, 1987. The Bethalto Historical Museum is housed in the former Village Hall.

While the majority of bunion surgeries involve the breaking and shifting of bones (osteotomy procedures), syndesmosis procedure is one of few surgical techniques that use a soft tissue or non-osteotomy (non-bone- breaking) approach to afford the same correction. More than 130 different surgical techniques have been described for correction of one single condition of the foot: the bunion deformity. ==Purpose== Bunion (hallux valgus) deformity is actually part of a complex of anatomical derangements of protruding mass (bunion), buckling of big toe (hallux valgus) and the bone behind it (metatarsus primus varus), displaced sesamoid bones (detrimental to the important walking function of big toe), collapsed metatarsal arch and several other secondary changes that are the domino effects of metatarsal primus varus. Thus, metatarsus primus varus correction has become the primary objective of all bunion surgeries. ===Primus varus deformity=== Primus varus deformity is the leaning of the first metatarsal bone away from the second metatarsal and towards the opposite foot (Fig. 1). As it leans over, its head sticks out to form the bunion bump and it also widens the forefoot to cause shoes feeling too tight. Thus when bunion pain becomes unmanageable, surgical correction is to narrow the forefoot by repositioning of the first metatarsal head back to its normal position. This can be done by osteotomy (bone- breaking), soft tissue (non-osteotomy) or fusion techniques. What causes the metatarsus primus varus deformity? A first metatarsal bone would lean towards one side is because ‚Äúthe medial hood ligament is stretched‚Äù and as it becomes weak and incompetent the first metatarsal would lose its support and then gradually shift out of place to form the metatarsus primus varus deformity. What causes ligaments to fail? Female hormone estrogen and genetic inheritance are the two primary factors behind the weak ligaments of bunion feet. Bunion deformity was found more common in people wearing shoes by a study in Hong Kong and increased in Japan due to changing in footwear to Western style. Aging, degeneration and trauma have also been attributed to weakening of the responsible ligaments. ==Technique== Syndesmosis procedure addresses specifically the two fundamental problems of metatarsus primus varus deformity that gives rise to the bunion deformity. They are leaning and instability of the first metatarsal bone . Syndesmosis procedure uprights the leaning first metatarsal bone with strong binding sutures between it and the second metatarsal bone (Fig. 2) and then also stabilizes it uniquely by creating a fibrous connecting bridge between these two bones (Fig. 3, 4). First metatarsal bone can be readily realigned because by definition of the metatarsus primus varus deformity its first metatarsal is abnormally loose and mobile. Fig. 5 Stress fracture of the second metatarsal bone ==Advantages == # No breaking of bones (Less postoperative pain and swelling, Fewer possible complications, Technically simpler for surgeons) # Single technique can be applied to almost all severities. # Both feet can be done at same time. # Immediate weight bearing is allowed and safe. # Instability issue is specifically addressed to prevent recurrence. # Function restoration has been proven by plantar pressure study. # No special surgical instruments or implants are needed. Specific cautions afterwards # Restricted walking of no more than 5,000 steps a day for three months # No sports or high heels for six months Possible complications # Wound infection # Cutaneous nerve injury # Cerclage suture breakage # Big toe joint stiffness # Second metatarsal stress fracture (Fig. 5) # Over-correction (Fig. 6) ==History== The surgical technique of syndesmosis procedure originated from the osteodesis procedure that was first described by Botteri in 1961. It has since been studied and reported by Pagella in 1971, Irwin in 1999 and Wu in 2007. Syndesmosis itself is a normal anatomical structure for the purpose of connecting two parallel long bones side by side, such as the tibia and fibula bones. The naming of syndesmosis procedure was thus to reflect the essence of the technique which is to create a ‚Äúsyndesmosis‚Äù mechanism to provide permanent stability to the first metatarsal to prevent recurrence. Both the bone-binding-sutures and syndesmosis-connection concepts are unique and revolutionary in a world of bunion surgery overwhelmingly dominated by osteotomy (bone-breaking) tradition. ==Other options== # For severe bunion deformity correction (Fig. 7) # For recurrence correction after osteotomy procedure (Fig. 8) Late deformity recurrence can happen after osteotomy (bone-breaking) procedures because osteotomy surgeries do not specifically stabilize first metatarsal bone. For recurrence correction after fusion procedure (Fig. 9) Metatarsus primus varus deformity and pain recurred 6 months after modified Lapidus procedure and it could also be again corrected by the syndesmosis procedure. == References == Category:Foot diseases Category:Skeletal disorders ","title":"Syndesmosis procedure"},{"id":"42015283","text":"On Tour is a song by Australian hip hop trio Bliss n Eso.

Six contestants compete for a chance to win up to ¬£10,000 cash on each episode. They sit in armchairs mounted on parallel tracks that stretch the length of the stage. The farthest one-fourth of each track is lit up red as a \\"danger zone.\\" If a contestant moves all the way through their danger zone to the end of the track, they are eliminated from the game and \\"ejected\\" by being tipped backward out of their chair amid a burst of light and dry ice smoke. In an interview with the Gloucestershire Echo, Peters stated that it was not answering the questions that was difficult; it was answering them whilst on the move that contestants struggled with. ==FormatRound 1=== Initially positioned halfway along the track, the contestants answer toss-up questions on the buzzer. A correct response moves a contestant to the start of the track and advances them to the next round, while a miss sends them to the end and ejects them. The round ends when either one contestant has been ejected or five have advanced, with the sixth being automatically ejected in the latter case. ===Round 2=== The host asks one question to each contestant in turn. Also a correct answer allows them to stay where they are, but a miss sends them along the track; the questions then continue, and the contestant can only stop and end their turn by giving a correct answer. After a contestant is ejected, the others return to the start of the track; the round ends after two ejections. The movement speed of the seats increases after each of the first three passes through the field. If no one has been ejected after four passes, a \\"sudden death\\" playoff is conducted under the rules of Round 1. At the start of this round, each contestant is given a \\"Panic Button\\" to use one time during the remainder of the game. Once a contestant enters the danger zone, they may press this button to stop moving. The current question (if any) is thrown out, and the host asks a multiple-choice question with three answer options. A correct answer moves the contestant to the leading edge of their danger zone, but a miss ejects them immediately. ===Round 3=== A toss-up question is asked on the buzzer to all three contestants, who are initially positioned at the start of the track. A correct answer allows a contestant to sit out the next question; if one of the other two answers it correctly, the third begins to move and can only stop by answering another question correctly or using their Panic Button, as in Round 2. An incorrect answer on a toss-up question starts the contestant moving immediately. After one contestant is ejected, the other two return to the start of the track and continue play as above, with the host asking only one toss-up at a time to determine who moves on each turn. The last remaining contestant advances to the final. ===Final Round=== The contestant must answer three sets of questions, each 45 seconds in length; they begin moving after a miss, but stop on a correct answer. After completing a set, the contestant returns to the start of the track and the movement speed increases. The contestant wins ¬£500 for completing the first set, ¬£1,000 for the second, and ¬£10,000 for the third, and is automatically ejected after winning the full prize. ==Filming== The series consists of thirty episodes, and was filmed next to Channel 4's Countdown. During filming, the seats malfunctioned and producers had to run on and off the stage in order to fix them. This left some audience members disgruntled, and they had to be bribed to stay by being given chocolates. ==Broadcast== The show forms part of a shake-up of ITV daytime programming; Tipping Point was replaced by Ejector Seat and The Chase was replaced by The Paul O'Grady Show. Good Morning Britain and Jo Frost: Family Matters were also introduced that week. The Chase returned on 2 June 2014 ==Critical reception== The game show has been the subject of some criticism, with Marion McMullen of the Coventry Telegraph accusing that the idea of tipping over chairs had been stolen from The Graham Norton Show and was \\"a gimmick too far\\". She also stated that the show was an inferior replacement for Tipping Point. That said, the Digital Spy team called it a \\"delight\\" and said \\"[we] can't wait to see more people being tipped back into their Ejector Seat chairs\\". ==References *.

St. Louis Street was one of the most prestigious sections of Edwardsville in the late 1800s, and several of the city's wealthiest residents owned homes along the street. The first house on the street, a log cabin, was built by John Lusk in 1809. In the 1870s, prominent residents of Edwardsville began building homes on the south side of St. Louis Street; these houses typically had large plots and open parkland between lots. In 1883, Judge Joseph Gillespie divided and sold the land on the north side of the street; the homes built on these lots are consequently much closer together. The homes built in the district were designed in popular architectural styles of the late 1800s; while the Queen Anne style is the most prevalent, Italianate, Chateauesque, and Classical Revival houses were also built. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 9, 1983. ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Italianate architecture in Illinois Category:Queen Anne architecture in Illinois Category:National Register of Historic Places in Madison County, Illinois Category:Houses in Madison County, Illinois Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois ","title":"St. Louis Street Historic District"},{"id":"42015564","text":"National Aboriginal Veterans Monument The Maliseet militia were made up of warriors from the Maliseet people of northeastern North America. Along with the Wabanaki Confederacy (particularly the Mi'kmaq militia), the French and Acadian militia, the Maliseet fought the British through six wars over a period of 75 years. They also mobilized against the British in the American Revolution. After confederation, Mi'kmaq warriors eventually joined Canada's war efforts in World War I and World War II. ==16th century Battle at Bae de Bic === According to Jacques Cartier, the Battle at Bae de Bic happened in the spring of 1534, 100 Iroquois warriors massacred a group of 200 Mi‚Äôkmaq camped on Massacre Island in the St. Lawrence River. Bae de Bic was an annual gather place for the Mi‚Äôkmaq along the St. Lawrence. Mi‚Äôkmaq scouting parties notified the village that the Iroquois attack the evening before the morning attack. They evacuated 30 of the infirm and elderly and about 200 Mi‚Äôkmaq vacated their encampment on the shore and retreated to an island in the bay. They took cover in a cave on the island and covered the entrance with branches. The Iroquois arrived at the vacant village in the morning. Finding it vacated, they divided into search parties but failed to find the Mi‚Äôkmaq until the morning of the next day. The Mi‚Äôkmaq warriors defended the tribe against the Iroquois assault. Initially, after many had been wounded on both sides, with the rising tide, the Mi‚Äôkmaq were able to repulse the assault and the Iroquois retreated to the mainland. The Mikmaq prepared a fortification on the island in preparation for the next assault at low tide. The Iroquois were again repulsed and treated to the mainland with the rising tide. By the following morning, the tide was again low and the Iroquois made their final approach. They had prepared arrows that carried fire which burned down the fortification and wiped out the Mi‚Äôkmaq. Twenty Iroquois were killed and thirty wounded in the battle. The Iroquois divided into two companies to return to their canoes on the Bouabouscache River.Cartier, second voyage, CL, IX√éle du Massacre, Rimouski, QC : Battle between Mi'kmaq and Iroquois c. 1534 === Battle at Bouabouscache River === Just prior to Battle at Bae de Bic, the Iroquois warriors had left their canoes and hid their provisions on the Bouabousche River, which the Mi‚Äôkmaq scouts had discovered and recruited assistance from 25 Maliseet warriors. The Mi‚Äôkmaq and Maliseet militia ambushed the first company of Iroquois to arrive at the site. They killed ten and wounded five of the Iroquois warriors before the second company of Iroquois arrived and the Mi‚Äôkmaq/ Maliseet militia retreated to the woods unharmed. Their canoes having been lost, 50 Iroquois, leaving twenty wounded behind, then regrouped to find their hidden provisions. Unable to find their supplies, at the end of the day they returned to the camp, the 20 wounded soldiers having been slaughtered by the Mi‚Äôkmaq/ Maliseet militia. The following morning, the 38 Iroquois warriors left their camp, killing twelve of their own wounded who would not be able to survive the long journey back to their village. 10 of the Mi‚Äôkmaq/ Maliseet stayed with the canoes and provisions while the remaining 15 pursued the Iroquois. The Mi‚Äôkmaq/ Maliseet militia pursued the Iroquois for three days, killing eleven of the wounded Iroquois stragglers. === Battle at Riviere Trois Pistoles === Shortly after the Battle at Bouabouscache River, the retreating Iroquois set up camp on the Riviere Trois Pistoles to build canoes to return to their village. An Iroquois hunting party was sent to hunt for food. The Mi‚Äôkmaq/ Maliseet militia killed the hunting party. The Iroquois went to find their missing hunting party and were ambushed by the Mi‚Äôkmaq/ Maliseet militia. They killed nine of the Iroquois, leaving 29 warriors who retreated to their camp on Riviere Trois Pistoles. The Mi‚Äôkmaq/ Maliseet militia divided into two companies and attacked the remaining Iroquois warriors. The battle left 3 Maliseet warriors dead and many others wounded. The Mi‚Äôkmaq/ Maliseet militia was victorious, however, killing all but six of the Iroquois, whom they took prisoner and later tortured and killed. (Cartier, second voyage, CL, IX) == King William's War == Maliseet and Mi'kmaw \\"attack on the [Maine] settlement\\" (c. 1690) === Siege of Pemaquid (1689) === The Maliseet from Fort Meductic participated in the Siege of Pemaquid (1689). The siege was a successful attack by a large band of Abenaki Indians from Forts Penobscot and Meductic on the English fort at Pemaquid, then the easternmost outpost of colonial Massachusetts (present- day Bristol, Maine). Possibly organized by the French-Abenaki leader Jean- Vincent d'Abbadie de Saint-Castin, the Indian force surrounded the fort, captured or killed most of the settlers outside it, and compelled its small garrison to surrender. On August 4, they burned the fort and the nearby settlement of Jamestown down. One of the captives the Maliseet took back to their main village Meductic on the Saint John River was John Gyles. Gyles' brother James was also captured by the Penobscot and taken to Fort Penobscot (present-day Castine, Maine) where he was tortured and burned alive at the stake.Raymond, p. 23; In Castine, a plaque on Dyce Head Lighthouse Road says: \\"UPON THESE HEIGHTS, in 1692, James Giles, a boy, and an Englishman, taken at Casco, held in slavery by Chief Madockawando for attempting to escape, were tortured by fire, compelled to eat their noses and ears and then burned to death at the stake.\\" === Battle of Fort Loyal (1690)=== During King William's War, the Battle of Fort Loyal (May 20, 1690) involved Mi'kmaq and Maliseet from Fort Meductic in New Brunswick capturing and destroying an English settlement on the Falmouth neck (site of present-day Portland, Maine), then part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The earliest garrison at Falmouth was Fort Loyal (1678) in what was then the center of town, the foot of India Street. In May 1690, four hundred to five hundred French and Indian troops under the command of Hertel Portneuf and St. Castin attacked the settlement.Webster, John Clarence. Acadia at the End of the Seventeenth Century. Saint John, NB, New Brunswick Museum, 1979 Grossly outnumbered, the settlers held out for four days before surrendering. Eventually two hundred were murdered and left in a large heap by the site of the fort. When a fresh Indian war broke out in 1716, authorities decided to demolish the fort and evacuate the city rather than risk another catastrophe. James Alexander was taken captive along with 100 other prisoners. Alexander was taken back to the Maliseet headquarters on the Saint John River at Meductic, New Brunswick. \\"James Alexander, a Jersey man,\\" was, with John Gyles, tortured at an Indian village on the St. John River. In the spring of 1691, two families of Mi'kmaq, who had lost friends by some English fishermen, came these many miles to avenge themselves on the captives. They were reported to have yelled and danced around their victims; tossed and threw them; held them by the hair and beat them - sometimes with an axe - and did this all day, compelling them also to dance and sing, until at night they were thrown out exhausted. Alexander, after a second torture, ran to the woods, but hunger drove him back to his tormentors. His fate is unknown. ‚Ä¢ In 1693-94 there swept over eastern Maine and New Brunswick a disease that proved very fatal to the Natives. Many of the warriors, including the chief of the Maliseet, died. After the defeat in the Battle of Port Royal (1690), Governor Joseph de Villebon moved the capital of Acadia to Fort Nashwaak on the St. John River for defensive purposes, and to better coordinate military attacks on New England with the natives at Meductic. === Raid on Oyster River === The Raid on Oyster River (also known as the Oyster River Massacre) happened during King William's War on July 18, 1694. In 1693 the English at Boston had entered into peace and trade negotiations with the Abenaki tribes in eastern Massachusetts. The French at Quebec under Governor Frontenac wished to disrupt the negotiations and sent Claude-S√©bastien de Villieu in the fall of 1693 into present-day Maine, with orders to \\"place himself at the head of the Acadian Indians and lead them against the English.\\"Webster, John Clarence. Acadia at the End of the Seventeenth Century. Saint John, NB, New Brunswick Museum, 1979, p. 57. Villieu spent the winter at Fort Nashwaak (see Siege of Fort Nashwaak (1696)). The Indian bands of the region were in general disagreement whether to attack the English or not, but after discussions by Villieu and cajoling by the Indians' priest Fr. Thury (and with support from Fr. Bigot), they went on the offensive. The English settlement of Oyster River (present-day Durham, New Hampshire) was attacked by Villieu with about 250 Abenaki Indians, composed of two main groups from Penobscot and the Norridgewock under command of their sagamore, Bomazeen (or Bomoseen). A number of Maliseet from Medoctec, led by Assacumbuit, took part in the attack. The Indian force was divided into two groups to attack the settlement, which was laid out on both sides of the Oyster River. Villieu led the Pentagoet and the Meductic/Nashwaaks. The attack commenced at daybreak, with the small forts quickly falling to the attackers. In all, 104 inhabitants were killed and 27 taken captive,Webster, John Clarence. Acadia at the End of the Seventeenth Century. Saint John, NB, New Brunswick Museum, 1979, p. 65 with half the dwellings, including the garrisons, pillaged and burned to the ground. Crops were destroyed and livestock killed, causing famine and destitution for survivors. === Siege of Pemaquid (1696) === New France, led by Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, along with the Maliseet and Mi'kmaq militias fought a naval battle in the Bay of Fundy before moving on to raid Bristol, Maine again. In the lead up to this battle in Fundy Bay, on July 5, 140 natives (Mi'kmaq and Maliseet), with Jacques Testard de Montigny and Chevalier, from their location of Manawoganish island, ambushed the crews of four English vessels. Some of the English were coming ashore in a long boat to get firewood. A native killed five of the nine men in the boat. The Mi'kmaq burned the vessel under the direction of Father Florentine (missionary to the Micmacs at Chignectou).http://www.ourroots.ca/page.aspx?id=1096401&qryID=de1d8ac8-494d-48dd-9996-2caaa55918b1 === Siege of Fort Nashwaak (1696) === The Maliseet from Meductic were also involved in protecting the Acadian capital Fort Nashwaak (present-day Fredericton, New Brunswick) from a New England attack. In the Siege of Fort Nashwaak, Colonel Benjamin Church was the leader of the New England force of 400 men. The siege lasted two days, between October 18‚Äì20, 1696, and formed part of a larger expedition by Church against a number of other Acadian communities. Aware of the pending attack, on the October 11, Governor Villebon made a request to Father Simon-G√©rard de La PlaceBinasco, Matteo.

He was ordained a Capuchin priest (Order of Friars Minor), and served in Acadia from 1693 until his death in 1699). to gather Maliseet militia from Meductic to defend the fort from an attack. On October 16, Father Simon-G√©rard and Acadian Sieur de Clignancourt of Aukpacque led 36 Maliseet militia members to Nashwaak to defend Fort Nashawaak.Raymond, p. 11, 26 On October 18 Church and his troops arrived opposite the fort, landed three cannons and assembled earthworks on the south bank of the Nashwaak River.Near where the Fort Nashwaak Motel now stands Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste was there to defend the capital.For details on the siege see Beamish Murdoch, pp. 228-231. Baptiste joined the Maliseet from Meductic for the duration of the siege. There was a fierce exchange of gunfire for two days, with the advantage going to the better sited French guns. The New Englanders were defeated, having suffered eight killed and seventeen wounded. The French lost one killed and two wounded.(Roger Marsters, 2004, p.34) In response to Church's failed siege, Acadian Rene d'Amour of Aukpacque and Father Simon-G√©rard accompanied an expedition of the Maliseet militia (who joined Louis de Buade de Frontenac's expedition), which, although one of the largest gatherings of natives ever assembled in Acadia, did not, after all, accomplish very much.Raymond, p. 26 == Father Rale's War == Father Rale's War was the first and only time Wabanaki would fight New Englanders and the British on their own terms and for their own reasons and not principally to defend French imperial interests. Wicken acknowledges, however, that while France was not officially involved, the French did offer material support for the Wabanaki . In response to Wabanaki hostilities toward territorial expansion, the governor of Nova Scotia, Richard Phillips, built a fort in traditional Mi'kmaq territory at Canso in 1720, and Massachusetts Governor Samuel Shute built forts on traditional Abenaki territory around the mouth of the Kennebec River: Fort George at Brunswick (1715); St. George's Fort at Thomaston (1720); and Fort Richmond (1721) at Richmond.The history of the state of Maine: from its first discovery, A.D ..., Volume 2, by William Durkee Williamson. 1832. p.88, 97. The French claimed the same territory by building churches in the Abenaki villages of Norridgewock (on the Kennebec River) and Medoctec (on the St. John River, four miles upriver from present-day Meductic, New Brunswick). Dummer's treaty, made in Boston in 1726, afforded a momentary peace to the tribes of Acadia. Three chiefs and about twenty-six warriors from Medoctec went to Annapolis Royal, in May 1728, to ratify this treaty.Raymond, p. 27 == King George's War == During King George's War, the Maliseet and Mi'kmaq sought revenge for the Ranger John Gorham's killing of Mi'kmaq families during the Siege of Annapolis Royal (1744). During the Siege of Annapolis Royal (1745) the Mi'kmaq and Maliseet took prisoner William Pote and some of Gorham's (Mohawk) Rangers. Among other places, Pote was taken to the Maliseet village of Aukpaque on the Saint John River. While at the village, Mi'kmaq from Nova Scotia arrived and on July 6, 1745, tortured him and a Mohawk ranger from Gorham's company named Jacob, as retribution for the killing of their family members by Gorham.Raymond, p. 42-43 On July 10, Pote witnessed another act of revenge when the Mi'kmaq tortured a Mohawk ranger from Gorham's company at Meductic.Raymond, p. 45 In 1749, before the outbreak of Father Le Loutre's War, a deputation of Maliseet, including the chief of Medoctec, went to Halifax and renewed the treaty. == French and Indian War == By the end of the 17th century, Meductic had a Jesuit mission and was incorporated into a French seigneury. The mission changed the landscape of Meductic, and by 1760 the Maliseet, who left to settle in other communities, abandoned the village. After the close of the war, Meductic continued to decline. In 1767 Father Charles Fransois Baillie entered into his register: \\"The last Indian at Medoctec having died, I cause the bell and other articles to be transported to Ekpahaugh [Aukpaque].\\"Raymond, p. 16 (The bell eventually made it to the church of St. Ann at Kingsclear but was damaged by lightning in 1904. The bell was melted down into smaller bells. One is at St. Ann at Kingsclear and another at the Acadian Museum, University of Moncton.) By the time the Loyalists arrived in 1783, the chapel and fort were still standing.Raymond, p. 17 == American Revolution  Maugerville Rebellion === During the American Revolution, in 1776, George Washington sent a letter to the Maliseet of the Saint John River asking for their support in their contest with Britain. Led by Chief Ambroise Saint Aubin, the Maliseets immediately began to plunder the British in the community of Maugerville, New Brunswick, burning some of their homes and taking others prisoner back to New England.James Hannay. The History of New Brunswick. p. 110; Ernest Clarke. The Siege of Fort Cumberland, 1776: An Episode in the American Revolution. McGill- Queen's University Press. 1995. p.41-43, p.82; The best descriptions of the Maugerville rebellion were made by Charles Godfrey Newland Jadis (See Claim of Charles 24 October 1776, NA AO 13. See also Jadis to Treasury, 30 March 1787, PRO T1/ 644) (Shortly after, the rebellion continued at the nearby Battle of Fort Cumberland.) In 1779, Maugerville was raided again by Maliseets working with John Allan in Machias, Maine. A vessel was captured and two or three residents' homes were plundered. In response, a blockhouse was built at the mouth of Oromocto River named Fort Hughes (named after the Lt. Governor of NS Sir Richard Hughes).Hannay, p. 121-122 === St. John River expedition === During the St. John River expedition, American Patriot Col. John Allan's untiring efforts to gain the friendship and support of the Indians during the four weeks he had been at Aukpaque were somewhat successful. There was a significant exodus of Maliseet from the region to join the American forces at Machias.Hannay, p. 119 On Sunday, July 13, 1777, a party of between 400 and 500 men, women, and children, embarked in 128 canoes from the Old Fort Meduetic (8 miles below Woodstock) for Machias. The party arrived at a very opportune moment for the Americans and afforded material assistance in the defence of that post during the attack made by Sir George Collier on the 13th to 15 August. The British did only minimal damage to the place, and the services of the Indians on the occasion earned for them the thanks of the council of Massachusetts.Rev. W. O.

He played as an outside left. ==Life and career== Ferguson was born in Coalburn, South Lanarkshire, the younger brother of Willie Ferguson, who went on to play for Chelsea and play for and manage Queen of the South. Like his brother, Pearson began his football career with Kello Rovers, the junior team local to the family home in Kirkconnel, Dumfries and Galloway. He moved on to Ayr United, and was playing for that club in the First Division in the 1929‚Äì30 season. He moved to Ireland in the 1931 close season to join Cork. He scored in the opening match of the season as Cork came back from two goals down to secure a 3‚Äì3 draw away to Dolphin, scored in the next match, a 2‚Äì2 draw with Shamrock Rovers, scored twice in the third, a 6‚Äì0 demolition of Jacobs, and in the fifth, exploited his pace to contribute four goals to a 5‚Äì3 defeat of Waterford. He finished the 22-game season with 21 goals, which made him the League of Ireland's top scorer (jointly with Waterford's Jack Forster) and helped his club finish runners-up to Shamrock Rovers. Like most of the \\"cross-Channel\\" players who had played in Ireland that season, Ferguson returned home, where he rejoined Ayr United. He then played five times for Queen of the South in the second half of the 1932‚Äì33 season, before moving south of the border to join Carlisle United of the Third Division North. In the second of his two seasons in England, he was Carlisle's leading scorer, but with only eleven goals as they finished bottom of the league. Ferguson then returned to Scotland and spent four more seasons in the second division: two with Morton (plus one appearance in the top tier at the start of a third after helping them to promotion in the 1936‚Äì37 season) before moving on to Montrose then East Stirlingshire for a year apiece. ==Honours== ;Individual *League of Ireland Top Scorer: ** 1931‚Äì32 ==References== Category:1909 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Date of birth unknown Category:Date of death unknown Category:Sportspeople from Dumfries and Galloway Category:Sportspeople from South Lanarkshire Category:Scottish footballers Category:Association football outside forwards Category:Scottish Junior Football Association players Category:Scottish expatriate footballers Category:Scottish expatriate sportspeople in Ireland Category:Expatriate association footballers in the Republic of Ireland Category:Kello Rovers F.C. players Category:Ayr United F.C. players Category:Cork F.C. players Category:Queen of the South F.C. players Category:Carlisle United F.C. players Category:Greenock Morton F.C. players Category:Montrose F.C. players Category:East Stirlingshire F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:League of Ireland players Category:English Football League players ","title":"Pearson Ferguson"},{"id":"42015619","text":"This is a list of mayors of the city of Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland.

The area later became a city when it passed a charter in 1902. It was annexed into Portland in 1915. John worked as a general store and ferry operator across the Willamette River to Linnton. He once served as Justice of the Peace and was twice an election judge. John was born in Ohio and first settled in Indiana with his wife and child where John worked as an educator. He joined the Bartleson‚ÄìBidwell Party in 1841, who were one of the first groups that trekked the California Trail. By this time, John's wife and child had died. He came to Oregon Country in the employment of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1843 after making it to Sacramento Valley. Following John's death in 1886, his estate was executed by Philip T. Smith who met court injunctions from John's sister and niece. Smith was replaced as executor by Robert Catilin who battled John's relatives until 1907 when the estate was finally settled. In John's will and testament he gave a large portion of his property towards the erection of a new public school for St. Johns and designated his personal effects liquidated and the funds be used for building materials. His only condition for the school was that it not be related to any religious \\"sect\\". In 1907, Catilin ordered the City of St. Johns to forfeit the land given to them by John, but gave them a small portion of the land to erect a school on. James John High School opened in 1911 and closed in 1921. ==Biography== James John, who born in Donnelsville, Ohio in 1809. He first settled in Lafayette, Indiana and worked as an educator before moving to Oregon by way of California. John was a widower in Indiana and never remarried. His son also died in Indiana. ===Missouri to California (1841‚Äì43)=== While working for John Bidwell as a part of the Bartleson‚ÄìBidwell Party starting in 1841, John became one of the first people who made the California Trail trek. He was of the first people on the expedition from Missouri to California when he left on May 16, 1841. Like all member of the crew, John was required to keep a journal but as noted in Nancy Kelsey's documents, John often neglected his writings. Two days after leaving, John was delayed when his oxen strayed. Later that day he met up with Bidwell and his party. On May 20, they reached the Kansas River and were assisted across by Native Americans who floated their items to the other shore. The next day they were invited to a Pawnee festivity where they smoked a calumet, what John described as the \\"peace pipe\\". During their time crossing the Rocky Mountains, John and Bidwell were trapped at the top of a peak and were forced to walk down the mountain in the dark, with their moccasins shredded from sharp rocks. They eventually reached a Native American settlement where they made camp. One of John's primary jobs on the journey was to acquire fish, trout being one of the parties preferences.McLynn, p. 83 Bidwell referred to John as \\"Jimmy\\". John went a separate route from Bidwell to get to Sutter's Fort in present day Sacramento, California which made him the one of the first members of the party to finish the journey.McLynn, p. 89 ===Oregon (1843‚Äì1886)=== When he completed his journey to California in 1843 he accepted a job with the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Vancouver in Oregon territory. On July 2, 1844 John wrote in his journal that he camped across the Willamette River from Linnton, Oregon which was likely the present day site of St. Johns. He resided in Linnton for the first few years where he intended to build a warehouse. However, he moved across the river established the settlement of \\"St. Johns\\" in 1845 by plotting a homestead. Land claim records were filed with Clackamas County in 1846 and 1848. By then, a dozen families had made St. Johns their home. John was known to offer warm meals to hungry people and even land to the homeless. He established a general store in 1850 and a rowboat ferry service across the Willamette River to Linnton in 1852. On April 5, 1853 John received a ferry licence from the Clackamas County recorder. John was elected the settlement's Justice of the Peace in 1870. He was a member of the Republican Party. In 1870, John constructed derricks for the United States Customs Service office in Portland. In 1876 and 1877, John fellow St. Johns resident B. O. Severence served as the settlement's election judges. In 1874, John heard rustling in his orchard and fired what he said was a warning shot that hit a 15-year-old boy in the leg. John said he regretted firing the weapon and requested to be placed at the Portland jail, which was granted for one night. When the case was brought before a grand jury John was acquitted of all charges. Death and estate On May 28, 1886, John was found dead in his bedroom. The coroner said John succumbed to \\"natural causes\\". He was discovered by his neighbor T. D. Taylor who recalled the incident, \\"This morning at 8 o'clock [am] I went and rapped on Mr. John's door and received no answer. I returned again between 11 and 12 o'clock as I wished to see him on business. I got no reply. I then went and called Mr. Crooks and told him I though something was wrong. We returned together and knocked at the door and still received no answer. We then placed some boxes beneath the window of his bedroom. Mr. Crooks got up there and noticed John lying in his bed, dead.\\" John was 77 years old at the time of his death. Prior to 1904, James John's grave had no headstone. Citizens of the newly incorporated City of St. Johns funded the marker on his grave site at Historic Columbian Cemetery on Columbia boulevard. John's will was signed and dated on May 14, 1888. It called for his personal property to be sold and his property be leased for a period no longer than 15 years. One plot of land was set dedicated to a public school for St. Johns. John's document read, \\"[the school] shall be public and open to the children of the school district, which shall embrace the town of St. Johns [...] It is not my intention to direct the particular branches of education should be taught, nor in any way to limit the use of money in promoting certain types of education, only I desire that it shall never be used to inculcate the doctrines of one religion sect one more then the other\\". In September 1893, John's sister Elizabeth Erwin and his niece Ira John from Indiana challenged his will in a Multnomah County court on the grounds that he was not fit when the document was made out and signed. Edward A. Deadly and H. B. Nicholas came forward to say they had witnessed James John sign the will and that he was of sound body and mind when he did so. His land was valued at US$100,000. Plans to sell the property were halted by the courts during the preceding. Philip T. Smith, the executor of the estate, was allowed to start selling plots of land in 1897 through 1900. Robert Catilin was appointed by the state circuit court to administrator the estate of James John in December 1901. The court allowed Catilin to start selling more land in June 1902. In 1903, the court cases were no longer pending so the funds in the estate could be used to build a new public school in St. Johns, per John's request. However in September 1907 the trustees announced the city did not own all the land that was left to the settlement and they had to turn it over with the exception of small plot where they eventually erected a high school. Legacy In November 1906, the newly built St. Johns‚ÄìLinnton ferry was named the James John \\"in honor\\" of the founder of the settlement. The citizens of St. Johns held a \\"Pioneer Day\\" where it was announced a statue of James John would be raised in the town if they could fund the project. It was their intention to have the monument ready for next years festivities. John's vision of a public school building for St. Johns was realized in 1911 when James John High School opened on the plot that was not repossessed by John's trustees. ==Journal entries== The following are journal entries from James John as recorded in the St. Johns Review by Oregon Historical Society director George H. Heins in 1906. ;1841 *May 17 & 18 ‚Äî \\"Stayed the night about 11 miles from the Wakarootia [Wakarusa River] creek and crossed it at 12 o'clock on the 18.

We are about 400 miles west of Independence, traveling through sandy but fertile plains. We are still traveling on the Blue. Left the Blue this morning and encamped on the prairie.\\" *July 13 ‚Äî \\"This morning we left the encampment and traveled over some rocky country. Killed one buffalo. We met two of our men about 10 o'clock that had been sent by the company on the 6 of July to rendezvous on Green River to make some arrangements for [the] company in exchanging the oxteams for mules, etc.: but they found no person there, not even an Indian on the whole route. We have not seen an Indian, except two, that are with us, since we left Laramie fort. We encamped on the banks of the creek last mentioned.\\" *July 14 ‚Äî \\"This day we lay here for the purpose of killing and laying in more meat. We had a hard frost here this morning.

He was one of the leading representatives of the romantic movement in Belgium and his work had an important influence on the development of history painting in Germany. ==Life== Edouard De Bi√®fve was born into a well-off and noble family in Brussels. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts of Brussels and then continued his studies from 1828 to 1830 in the school of the Belgian history painter Joseph Paelinck, who had been a pupil of Jacques-Louis David. He went to Paris in 1831, where he became a follower of the new romantic movement. He frequented the studio of the French romantic sculptor David d'Angers. Sculpting and painting at the same time, he exhibited his works in Paris and also participated in exhibitions in Antwerp, Ghent and Brussels. His painting entitled Count Ugolino and his sons in the tower of Pisa was particularly well received when it was exhibited in 1836.Lucien Solvay, Notice sur Edouard De Bi√®fve, Acad√©mie royale de Belgique, Bruxelles, 1919 Compromise of the nobles His romantic paintings on historic subjects got the attention of the government of the newly independent Belgian state which was looking to glorify its past as well as to foster a new cultural renaissance in Belgium. The government commissioned a work from him on a theme related to the revolt of the Spanish Netherlands against the Spanish rulers. The painting entitled the Compromise of the nobles depicts the moment when members of the lesser nobility in the Spanish Netherlands conclude a local covenant (the ‚Äòcompromise‚Äô) to petition the Regent Margaret of Parma on 5 April 1566 to moderate the repression of so-called heresy in the country. The painting was exhibited in 1841 together with a history painting - also commissioned by the Belgian government - entitled The Abdication of Charles V by the renowned Belgian romantic painter Louis Gallait. Both paintings were praised and were exhibited in many cities in Europe. They enjoyed a particularly enthusiastic reception in Germany where they formed an important impetus for the development of a German school of history painting.John R. Hinde, Jacob Burckhardt and the Crisis of Modernity, McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 28 Jun, 2000, p. 249 The painting also gained de Bi√®fve the patronage of Prince Frederick William of Prussia (the future Frederick III) who commissioned a painting entitled Rubens establishes peace between Spain and England. The kings of Bavaria and Wurtemberg followed suit and also ordered paintings from him. As a sign of the high regard in which he was held in the German-speaking world he was invited to become a member of the Academies of Berlin, Dresden, Munich and Vienna. In the year 1841 he returned from Paris and lived from then on in Brussels.Jean Fran√ßois Edouard de Bi√®fve at Die Akademie der K√ºnste When the painting ordered by the King of Prussia was finally finished and exhibited in Brussels in 1848, the work met with negative criticism and was judged to be mediocre and historically inaccurate. Thereafter, de Bi√®fve continued to work for his royal patrons and would occasionally receive a commission from the Belgian government (such as the Belgium founding the monarchy, painted for the meeting hall of the Belgian Senate, 1853). However, he no longer exhibited his new works publicly until 1875 when he showed a historic painting entitled The episode of the banquet of the confederated nobles at the Salon of Brussels. By that time, history painting had become a thing of the past and was being replaced by the modernist movement. On his death, he left the Belgian state all the paintings in his studio together with a sum of money for the erection of a magnificent tomb monument. His tomb can be visited at the cemetery of Laeken.Brusselse wandelingen. Het kerkhof van Laken ==Work== Portrait of Alexandra of Denmark Edouard De Bi√®fve mainly painted history paintings on unusually large canvasses. He belonged to the first wave of Belgian romantic painters who had typically trained in Paris where they had come into contact with the new romantic movement. Others in this group included Gustave Wappers, Louis Gallait, Ernest Slingeneyer, Nicaise de Keyser and other minor figures. They chose as the subject matter of their work important historical events in Belgium‚Äôs history which were regarded as key to the country‚Äôs national identity. Unlike their French models such as Delacroix, their work, though colourful, lacked true romantic zest and was quickly recuperated by the establishment which rewarded the artists with commissions and rewards.Johan Decavele, et al. \\"Belgium.\\" Grove Art Online.

The Almeh depicts an Egyptian dancing girl reclining on a couch. The painting caused quite a stir when it was exhibited at the Brussels Salon of 1842. It scandalised viewers who felt it was flagrantly sexual.Jill L.

She claimed that the Virgin of the Sorrows appeared to her in Prado Nuevo estate in the Madrilenian municipality of El Escorial on 14 June 1981. Following these statements arose a religious movement that has mobilized thousands of people who go to the place of Marian apparitions. She was called \\"El Escorial seer\\" referring to the village where Amparo claimed to have seen the apparitions. These apparitions have not yet been recognized by the Catholic Church and have created controversy that has reached the courts. All that after 1981 came around these events has been described by some people as ¬´business and destructive sect¬ª. == Biography == Luz Amparo Cuevas Arteseros was born in a poor family on 13 March 1931 in the hamlet Pesebre of Albacete√±o municipality of Pe√±ascosa, Castile-La Mancha, Spain. Her parents were Mar√≠a Dolores Arteseros and Jacinto Cuevas Ruiz. She married Nicasio Barderas Bravo and had seven children. She was a humble and non-student woman but a good communicator. On June 14, 1981, she stated that on the Prado Nuevo estate, from the Madrilenian municipality of El Escorial, the Virgin of Sorrows had appeared to her on an ash, saying she was \\"the instrument chosen by the Lord and the Virgin to communicate their messages\\". Since November 1980 had some previous manifestations. The fact of the appearance of the Virgin, which would be repeated several times until 2002, attracted thousands of people from different parts of Spain and countries like Portugal, France, Argentina, Mexico and Italy. Amparo Cuevas put voice messages which claims received by the Virgin. These speeches were recorded and reproduced by loudspeakers. The 1985, the then Archbishop of Madrid, Angel Suqu√≠a, following due process, decided not to endorse the nature of the supposed supernatural apparitions and revelations in Prado Nuevo. In April 2012 Archbishop of Madrid Antonio Mar√≠a Rouco Varela authorized to celebrate Easter Triduum at the site of the apparitions and the construction of a chapel, while always keeping the resolution of its predecessor. This chapel was built after April 2012, the Archbishop of Madrid, Cardinal Rouco Varela, give approval and the council in June, permit for construction. Beside the number of devotees also came a movement of family and ex-devotees who accused Luz Amparo Cuevas and the organization that had formed around her to be a destructive sect and physical and psychological abuses. On May 26, 1983, she suffered an attack by three unknown men. On Friday, August 17, 2012, Luz Amparo Cuevas Arteseros died at her home in El Escorial, after a long illness. Her funeral opened the chapel dedicated to the Mother of God that was raised on the site of the apparition, chapel which was one of the requests which the Virgin performed \\"for the measurement of the Passion of her Son\\" and where she was buried. == The apparitions == Although in October 1980 Luz Amparo Cuevas had already a strange experience, on June 14, 1981, said she saw the Virgin of Sorrows on an ash on the estate \\"Prado Nuevo.\\" Virgin gives her the following message: On 24 June 1983 the Virgin reappears and asks to establish \\"houses of love and mercy to the poors.\\". The Virgin appears giving different messages repeatedly, and appears on 18 September 1983, 25 and 31 May 1984. According itself Amparo get to see the Virgin to 376 times.Amparo Cuevas, una vida de luces y sombras El correro. 25.08.12 - 07:34 - LUIS RABOSO  MADRID At the beginning of the 1990s, the then mayor of El Escorial, the socialist Mariano Rodr√≠guez, the rector, Pablo Camacho Becerra, and the administrator of the estate Prado Nuevo, Tomas Ley√∫n, tried to end the movement closing with support of the City Council, the estate. On 15 September 1995 Prado Nuevo reopens, losing Spanish Socialist Workers' Party the mayoralty. The Rector, Don Pablo Camacho Becerra, never mobilized either for or against, following the instructions of Cardinal Archbishop of Madrid-Alcal√°, Vicente Enrique Taranc√≥n, who ordered him to ignore phenomena. == The work == Around the Marian apparitions in Prado Nuevo, a network of foundations and religious institutions is created and developed. This is known as \\"the Work of the Mother of God of El Escorial.\\" In 1994 is created the \\"Foundation Pia Independent Lady of Sorrows\\" and \\"Public Association of Faithful and Repairers of Our Lady the Virgin of Sorrows.\\" The \\"Public Association of Faithful and Repairers of Our Lady the Virgin of Sorrows\\" has over 132 properties.

One of the earliest Buddhist sculptures from the Indian subcontinent, it has been part of the British Museum's collection since 1842.British Museum Collection British Museum Highlights ==History== The bejewelled figure of the yakshi was originally installed on one of the gateways that surrounded the Great Stupa at Sanchi, which is said to have contained the relics of the Buddha. In the 1st century AD four toranas or large gateways were erected around the stupa, which served as the main entrances to a circular processional walkway that surrounded the holy building. Made of sandstone, the gateways were elaborately decorated with some of the earliest surviving forms of buddhist iconography. The beam of the western gateway was originally supported by this bracket figure. During the preliminary excavations at the site in the early nineteenth century, it came into the possession of a Mrs Tucker, who donated it to the British Museum in 1842. One of the few figures from the site in the West,The Boston Museum of Fine Arts has another Sanchi figureThe Los Angeles County Museum of Art has two similar figures it remains one of the most important early Buddhist sculptures in the museum's collection. Detail of the northern gate at Sanchi, with similar yakshi brackets below the upper and middle beams. ==Description== Carved in white sandstone, the almost nude figure of the yakshi figure is shown clasping onto the branches of a tree with her arms, with her right leg wrapped around its trunk. She is weighed down with ornate jewellery around her neck, waist and ankles. The sculpture also acted as an architectural bracket, supporting a long sandstone beam that once ran above the yakshi's head. The Shalabhanjika Yakshi thus served two purposes: as a fertility symbol associated with the vitality of the fruit-bearing tree and as a structural element supporting the whole configuration of the gateway. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *W.

It took advantage of a legal loophole known as the \\"protection gap\\" that allowed bootleggers to release old recordings due to ambiguous copyright laws. In all, eight volumes were produced. It was not the first Beatles bootleg to appear on compact disc but it was the first one to achieve widespread attention with bootleggers, because its sound quality showed what digital remastering was capable of. ==History== The bootleg appeared after John Barrett, an engineer at Abbey Road Studios, performed an audit of the material in the studio's archives in 1984 and made backups onto tape with the strict condition that they were not to be copied or sold. However, a Dutch collector managed to purchase some studio tapes for $20,000, which were subsequently resold to a German fan, Dieter Schubert. Schubert believed that any studio recordings made before Germany's ratification of the Rome Convention in 1966 were public domain in that country, and therefore decided to create his own bootleg label, Swingin' Pig, and released his titles on CD. The logo and name were based on the earlier Trademark of Quality bootleg label that regularly featured William Stout's artwork on its covers. One bootlegger claimed it to be \\"the single most important release in the history of CDs ... the quality just blew people's minds\\". Author Clinton Heylin believes some tracks on the Ultra Rare Trax series sounded even better than the then recent CD reissues of official material from EMI. EMI Records, which held copyrights to the Beatles' studio recordings, was unhappy that somebody had effectively stolen work they held the rights to and released it. A representative was \\"mortified\\" to discover that the first volume of Ultra Rare Trax contained previously unreleased recordings of \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", and the original 1963 recording of \\"One After 909\\" that was intended for Please Please Me. EMI representative Mike Heatly said in an interview with ICE Magazine that he had no idea how a bootlegger had managed to obtain such high- quality recordings. The bootleg also convinced fans that there was far more unreleased material in the EMI vaults than was previously thought. Some of the material on the Ultra Rare Trax series was subsequently officially released on the Anthology series in the mid-1990s, though Michael Callucci, writing for Classic Rock magazine, claims the original bootlegs are still worth hearing as they contain material not on the official release. ==ReferencesSources== * * * Category:The Beatles bootleg recordings Category:Compilation album series ","title":"Ultra Rare Trax"},{"id":"42015888","text":"Jorge de C√°rdenas Pl√° (born January 2, 1933 in Havana, Cuba) is a Cuban former Olympic sailor.

Markham Road, which in turn becomes the Highlands Highway is the main thoroughfare through the suburb. == Papuan Compound == Within the suburb is the Papuan Compound established in the 1960s. The population, according to the latest census is 130 households with 770 residents. Local persons can lease cheap sites and build houses limited by their budget. Often however many leaseholders left the location without formally transferring the lease and were not able to be located. Further research has indicated that the residents of settlements such as the Papuan Compound have found to be all from the same district. == Morobe Showgrounds == The Morobe Lae Showgrounds are located in the suburb. The first Morobe Show was held in 1959, but on three occasions the Show had to be cancelled. In 1983 Lae was isolated by floods, in 1991 law and order problems caused a curfew to be imposed from 6 am to 6 pm and in 2009 an outbreak of cholera in the province made it unwise to have a large gathering of people. Mrs. Flora Shaw Stewart (1886‚Äì1979) was a founding member of the Morobe Agricultural Society and would often lead the grand parades at annual shows. The festivities start one week before the Show with the Lae Show Ball in the smartly decorated Pavilion with music supplied by the Papua New Guinea Police Band and catering provided by the Lae International Hotel. In 1968 the University of Technology relocated from Port Moresby to Lae and during the process students had to be housed in temporary accommodation at the showgrounds. In 1983 and 1992 major floods devastated the region with relief operations described as haphazard, unsystematic and often uncoordinated. The initial response by the provincial disaster committee was to evacuate the victims immediately to temporary care centres at the Lae show grounds and Igam Army Barracks. == See also == * Morobe Show ==NotesReferences== Category:Suburbs of Lae ","title":"Dowsett, Papua New Guinea"},{"id":"42015909","text":"The World This Week (TWTW), is a weekly current events and news show anchored by Ya'akov Eilon.

Stream of Passion produced the album after leaving Napalm Records, financing it through crowdfunding website Indiegogo, and was their only album with the same line-up than its predecessor. ==Background== Having signed to Napalm Records in 2008, Stream of Passion parted with the record label in 2012. Speaking about the split, lead vocalist Marcela Bovio said: > \\"I would rather not get very specific but let's say that we didn't think > that we had the same ideas, and we didn't really think that they 'got' us > that well\\". Soon after, the band decided to fund their planned fourth album by way of fan donations, announcing a campaign through the crowdfunding website Indiegogo on July 16, 2013. Regarding the decision to fund the album this way, bass player Johan van Stratum commented: > \\"Times are changing, and so is the production of music and the way it is > consumed. By taking things in their own hands, bands have more freedom and > fans are enabled to support their favorites directly.\\" Donations to the campaign remained open for 3 months, with a target of raising ‚Ç¨25,000 to produce the new album. The campaign eventually generated almost twice the target goal, finishing at ‚Ç¨43,881. As a reward for their fans after surpassing their secondary goal of ‚Ç¨40,000, the band recorded an acoustic set of songs from the upcoming album, exclusively for those who had contributed to the album's funding.

An important water route Keitele Canal runs in front of the paintings. There are two art areas, Saraakallio I and Saraakallio II. It is difficult to count and list all the paintings of Saraakallio, partly because they are so many and varied, partly because many of them are blurred, fragmentary or have been painted over. The amount of pictures is between 50‚Äì200, and therefore it is the biggest rock art area in Finland. The main examinations of Saraakallio are made by amateur archaeologist Pekka Kivik√§s. Oldest paintings are circa 6 600 years old. The most common themes in Saraakallio paintings are deer, human, and boat figures. Saraakallio rock paintings are made by using red paint, which is made of hematite-containing soil mixed presumably with blood, urea and eggs.Visiting Saraakallio rock paintings.

Ghiyath later died in 1202, and was succeeded by his brother Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad, who shortly appointed Ala al-Din Ali as the governor of Ghur, Gharchistan and Zamindawar. Ala al-Din Ali later lead a campaign against the Ismailis in Quhistan. After the death of Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad in 1206, Ala al-Din Ali was dismissed by the new Sultan Ghiyath al- Din Mahmud, who had him imprisoned in a fortress in Gharchistan. Ala al-Din Ali, however, was later freed by the ghulam Tajuddin Yildoz, who crowned him as the Sultan of the Ghurid dynasty. After a year Tajuddin Yildoz was forced to surrender Firuzkuh to the Khwarazmian dynasty, and Ala al-Din Ali was captured by a Khwarazmian army and was brought to Khwarazm, where he lived in an honorable exile in Khwarazm.

The Swedish army of about 2,100 men assisted by approximately 2,000 peasants under the command of Jacob Spens defeated a Russian force of about 6,000 men. ==Prelude== After the crushing defeat at Narva by Charles XII of Sweden, the Russian tsar Peter I of Russia gathered his forces near the Swedish borders at Pskov and Gdov in order to start a new offensive into the Swedish Livonia. Charles who suspected the offensive, gathered forces of his own under the command of Magnus Stenbock and Jacob Spens to cross the Russian border and destroy the two footholds of Izborsk and Petschora. Stenbock saw his force heavily outnumbered by the guarding Russian army at Gdov and so, forced to retreat, contented himself with burning and savaging the Russian lands in the area before crossing the Swedish border. ==Fighting at Petschora== Spens arrived to his destination in late February and there sought to meet the Russian army in the open field. The two armies met outside the town of Petschora at 23 February. The Russians launched an attack on the peasants assisting the Swedes, causing riots in the lines. However, Spens then Counterattacked with his Swedish Lifeguard of Horse which drove the Russians to seek cover in the town under fierce fighting. The effective passages for cavalry attacks in the town became too narrow and Spens pulled them back in order for his infantry to break down their opponents. The Russians then fled into the houses shooting at the Swedes who in turn set the town on fire where many were burned alive. However, the main bulk of the Russians reached the monastery to escape the Swedish onslaught. The Swedes unsuccessfully stormed its surrounding walls which proved too hard without artillery. Spens aborted the operation while some Cossacks attacked his accompanying peasants. He, instead satisfied with burning the nearby villages and then returned to the Swedish border. The Swedes had lost 30 men killed and another 60 wounded in the fighting, the Russians on the other hand lost 500 men killed excluding the ones who were burnt to death in the town. ==Aftermath== The Russian Tsar presumed the reconnaissance operation to be a step in a full scale Swedish invasion and so gave orders for no Russians to retreat any further than the Pskov‚ÄìGdov line which he reinforced along with Izborsk and Petschora where he built fortresses. However, Charles who were stuck at Laiuse because of the ongoing winter, later broke up with his army having been in winter quarters and started his march towards the south, against the Saxons under Augustus II whom he estimated being the greatest current threat. After a while, the Swedish and Saxon armies met in the battle of D√ºna where the Swedish king, after a bold landing, managed to cross the river and force his opponents to retreat, leaving all of Courland open for occupation.Laidre, Margus. pp. 220 Later, while entering the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth on the chase after king Augustus‚Äîwho were also the ruler of the commonwealth‚Äîthe Russians started their offensive deep into the Swedish overseas, which they would seize 20 years later, during the end of the war. However, the same year, in 1701, they first encountered the Swedish general Wolmar Anton von Schlippenbach in the battle of Rauge where Boris Sheremetev‚Äîone of Peters' foremost generals‚Äîwas defeated, which would only be the beginning of Peters' ambition for an \\"open window to the west\\".Sundberg (2010).

Material at the site spans over 10,000 years, and the site is unique in that, due to glacial rebound, it is horizontally stratified rather than vertically stratified. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. ==History== In 1889, Frank and Mary Samels purchased 64 acres of land on Skegemog Point, the peninsuala separating Lake Skegemog from Elk Lake. While farming the site, he discovered many Indian artifacts, arrow points and axes, as well as many mounds and pits along the lakeshore. In the 1920s, an archaeologist from the University of Michigan surveyed the site, and in 1930 department head Wilbert B. Hinsdale did further work. Frank Samels died in 1955, and passed the farm to his three sons Dennis, Ben, and Rob Samels. In 1965, the Samels gave permission to Charles Cleland, Michigan State University Museum Curator, to excavate the site. Cleland discovered evidence of a long history of habitation at the site. In 1972, the site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the 1990s, the Samels entered into an agreement with The Archaeological Conservancy to preserve the entire farm, including the archaeological site. After the last of the Samels brothers died in 2002, the Conservancy leased the farm to a nonprofit group, the Samels Family Heritage Society, and it became an education center. ==Description== The Skegemog Point Site includes artifacts from a range of time periods, including Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Woodland periods. The material at the site is primarily at or near the surface, and is spread over a area on and below a beach terrace, and extending into the lake. The site is horizontally stratified, with the Paleo-Indian section, dating to around 10,000 BCE, located at the highest elevation furthest from the lakeshore. This is due to glacial rebound, where the underlying limestone slowly rises, changing the relative location of the lakeshore. The Archaic section, dating to perhaps 3000 BCE, is located closer to the lakeshore, and the Late Woodland section, dating to around 900-1200 AD, is located nearest the shore. The Late Woodland section of the site was partially excavated in the 1960s. It contains at least 26 hearth areas, as well as charcoal, potsherds, bone fragments and seeds. It also contains multiple postmolds set in circular configurations of about in diameter, suggesting temporary or seasonal wigwam-type structures. The other portions of the site have not been extensively excavated, although Clovis points have been found in the older portion of the site. ==References== Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Geography of Grand Traverse County, Michigan Category:National Register of Historic Places in Grand Traverse County, Michigan ","title":"Skegemog Point Site"},{"id":"42016037","text":"Altƒ±ndere is a Turkish word and may refer to: ==Surname== * Halil Altƒ±ndere (born 1971), Turkish contemporary artist * Hasret Altƒ±ndere (born 1980), Turkish women's footballer ==Places== * Altƒ±ndere, Sason, a village in Sason district of Batman Province, Turkey * Altƒ±ndere Valley National Park, a national park in Ma√ßka district of Trabzon Province, Turkey ","title":"Altƒ±ndere"},{"id":"42016041","text":"Sri Bannari Amman is a 2002 Tamil devotional film written and directed by Bharathi Kannan.

It is typically applied to text, grouping words into clusters that are assumed to be semantically related by virtue of their having been embedded in similar contexts. == Introduction == In natural language processing, Brown clustering or IBM clustering is a form of hierarchical clustering of words based on the contexts in which they occur, proposed by Peter Brown, Vincent Della Pietra, Peter deSouza, Jennifer Lai, and Robert Mercer of IBM in the context of language modeling. The intuition behind the method is that a class-based language model (also called cluster -gram model), i.e. one where probabilities of words are based on the classes (clusters) of previous words, is used to address the data sparsity problem inherent in language modeling. Jurafsky and Martin give the example of a flight reservation system that needs to estimate the likelihood of the bigram \\"to Shanghai\\", without having seen this in a training set. The system can obtain a good estimate if it can cluster \\"Shanghai\\" with other city names, then make its estimate based on the likelihood of phrases such as \\"to London\\", \\"to Beijing\\" and \\"to Denver\\". == Technical definition == Brown groups items (i.e., types) into classes, using a binary merging criterion based on the log- probability of a text under a class-based language model, i.e. a probability model that takes the clustering into account. Thus, average mutual information (AMI) is the optimization function, and merges are chosen such that they incur the least loss in global mutual information. As a result, the output can be thought of not only as a binary tree but perhaps more helpfully as a sequence of merges, terminating with one big class of all words. This model has the same general form as a hidden Markov model, reduced to bigram probabilities in Brown's solution to the problem. MI is defined as: :\\\\operatorname{MI}(c_i, c_j) = \\\\Pr(\\\\langle c_i, c_j\\\\rangle) \\\\log_2 \\\\frac{\\\\Pr(\\\\langle c_i, c_j\\\\rangle)}{\\\\Pr(\\\\langle c_i, *\\\\rangle) \\\\Pr(\\\\langle *, c_j\\\\rangle)} Finding the clustering that maximizes the likelihood of the data is computationally expensive. The approach proposed by Brown et al. is a greedy heuristic. The work also suggests use of Brown clusterings as a simplistic bigram class-based language model. Given cluster membership indicators for the tokens in a text, the probability of the word instance given preceding word is given by: :\\\\Pr(w_i  w_{i-1}) = \\\\Pr(w_i  c_i) \\\\Pr(c_i  c_{i-1}) This has been criticised as being of limited utility, as it only ever predicts the most common word in any class, and so is restricted to word types; this is reflected in the low relative reduction in perplexity found when using this model and Brown. == Variations == Other works have examined trigrams in their approaches to the Brown clustering problem. Brown clustering as proposed generates a fixed number of output classes. It is important to choose the correct number of classes, which is task-dependent. The cluster memberships of words resulting from Brown clustering can be used as features in a variety of machine-learned natural language processing tasks. A generalization of the algorithm was published in the AAAI conference in 2016, including a succinct formal definition of the 1992 version and then also the general form. Core to this is the concept that the classes considered for merging do not necessarily represent the final number of classes output, and that altering the number of classes considered for merging directly affects the speed and quality of the final result. There are no known theoretical guarantees on the greedy heuristic proposed by Brown et al. (as of February 2018). However, the clustering problem can be framed as estimating the parameters of the underlying class-based language model: it is possible to develop a consistent estimator for this model under mild assumptions. ==See also== * Feature learning ==References * How to tune Brown clustering Category:Cluster analysis Category:Hidden Markov models Category:Language modeling Category:Computational linguistics Category:Statistical natural language processing ","title":"Brown clustering"},{"id":"42016108","text":"Olof Viktor \\"Olle\\" √Öberg (24 January 1925 ‚Äì 20 December 2013) was a Swedish middle distance runner.

The 19th-century scholar of Frankish Greece, Karl Hopf, proposed that he was a brother of the second Duke of Athens, Guy I de la Roche, who at the time was supposed to be the nephew of the duchy's founder, Otto de la Roche. More recent research has established that Guy was in fact Otto's son, leaving William's identity open to question. He may indeed have been a son of Ponce de la Roche, Otto's brother, who was once believed to have been Guy's father, or alternatively a son of Otto like Guy, or a descendant of another branch of the family altogether. Whatever his origin, William by 1256 became the lord of the Barony of Veligosti (Miser Guglielmo de Villegorde in Marino Sanudo's history) in the Principality of Achaea. The exact manner of his acquisition of this fief is unknown. The barony originally belonged to the Mons family, but was probably ceded to William after Matthew of Mons married a Byzantine princess and left the principality. Hopf hypothesized that William may have married a sister of Matthew of Mons. William also held the region of Damala in the Argolid as a fief‚Äîapparently detached from the lordship of Argos and Nauplia, which was held by Guy‚Äîand the two domains of Damala and Veligosti became united under the same title. In 1257‚Äì58 he became involved in the War of the Euboeote Succession, siding with the Lombard triarchs of Euboea and the Republic of Venice against his suzerain, Prince William II of Villehardouin.

She has published several photo books and presented her work in national and international exhibitions. == Biography == Christa Frieda Vogel was born in 1960 in Meppen, Emsland in Germany, and studied graphic design from 1982 to 1988 at what is now the Berlin University of the Arts. While working as a make-up artist she acquired a private pilot license (PPLA, CVFR, KFB). In 2000 she became a founding member of the Fotoschule am Schiffbauerdamm and worked as a curator and exhibition manager at the Postfuhramt Berlin. Travels have led her to Venice, Croatia and Macedonia, as well as to Georgia and Turkey. In Turkey she lived and worked as a photographer and curator from 2009 to 2013. In 2013 she moved back to Berlin.Cfr. Christa Frieda Vogel'den Bir Fotoƒüraf ve Sergi Projesi, in Haberler (Turkish Magazine), 7 September 2011. == Works == Vogel's photography is mostly documentary: In the series (and book) Georgien (Georgia) she photographed people as if they were their own monuments. Her pictorial strategy rests, both in color and black and white images, on the long shot and the central figure.Cfr. Ein Aufruf gegen den Krieg ('A Call against War' review), in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 27 November 2008, R 10. For her exhibition and book project Artistanbul Vogel portrayed 34 fine artists, male and female, of three generations in Istanbul and accompanied them to their favourite places. During the two years of work on this series she established the gallery project Galata House of Art in Beyoƒülu which hosts both artists from Berlin and Istanbul. It was there where Vogel presented in 2011 her Artistanbul-series flanked by works of the portrayed, among them Ara G√ºler, Burhan Doƒüan√ßay, Mahmut Celayir, Erdoƒüan Zumrutoƒülu and Hande Varsat.Cfr.

Similar strategies are employed within the \\"Blaues Wunder\\" series (Blue Miracle) as a study of the (under-)water world in general whilst the b/w series Jellyfish focuses in particular on the bizarre bodies of the gelatinous creatures.Cfr.

The station is located at Ijede / Egbin, in Ikorodu, It is about 40 km north east of the city of Lagos, and is situated on low land in Ijede and bounded by the Lagoon to the south, Agura/Gberigbe to the north and situated in Ijede Local Council Development Area. The government acquired most of the land for the project by resettling the inhabitants to Ipakan. The first unit of the plant was commissioned in July 1985,while the last was commissioned in September 1986. The station is of reheat type with high intermediate low pressure impulse reaction turbine design and a hydrogen cooled generator. ==History== Construction work started in 1982 by Marubeni Consortium which used Hitachi Company of Japan for the Electric/Mechanical and Bouygues of France for civil works . The first unit (Unit 3) was completed and commissioned on the 13th May, 1985 and the other five units were commissioned at six-monthly intervals. Upon completion of the ramp-structured edifice, the commissioning was carried out under the auspice of the then Head of States and commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida. The Egbin Thermal Power Plant is a gas-fired plant with six 220MW independent boiler turbine units. It can also run on High Pour Fuel Oil, commonly called HPFO. ==Connections to power grid== Power generated is sent to the national grid by three main transmission lines, namely: Ikeja West (330 kV) line; Ajah (330 kV) line and Ikorodu (132 kV) lines. ==Key eventsPrivatisation=== After a series of negotiations and payment of $407.3 million, The Federal Government of Nigeria handed over Egbin Thermal Power Plant to the core investor, a joint venture between Sahara Power Group and KEPCO, on 1 November 2013. The first attempt at privatising Egbin Power plant was in May 2007 when KEPCO Energy Resources offered to pay $280 million to acquire 51 per cent shares of the company. As confirmation of their interest KEPCO paid $28 million, being the initial payment of 10 percent of the bid price. As a result of unresolved issues, such as power purchase and gas supply agreement, the process was halted. In 2013, in continuation of the 2007 agreement between the Federal Government of Nigeria and KEPCO, the South Korean power company was granted approval to acquire an additional 19 percent of the plant at a new valuation. National Council on Privatisation approved the transaction while the Bureau of Public Enterprises handled the sale process. The bureau set a deadline for the payment of $407.3 million (about N63.95 billion), which was the new price at which 70% of the plant was valued. ===Rehabilitation of unit=== The rehabilitation of Unit Six (ST-06) in Egbin, which suffered a boiler tube explosion in 2006, began in November, 2014 and was completed in January, 2015. This rehabilitation restored the plant back to its full capacity of 1320MW and was carried out by Hitachi. Korea Electrical Power Nigeria Limited currently serves as a technical partner to Sahara Power Group with the goal of overhauling all the units in the plant, while achieving 85 percent power availability and 34 percent efficiency. In early March 2016, the plant's management warned that it may have to close due to financial strains. ==References== Category:Power stations in Nigeria Category:Buildings and structures in Lagos State Category:Economy of Lagos State Category:Ikorodu ","title":"Egbin Thermal Power Station"},{"id":"42016351","text":"MWI Animal Health () is an international animal health products supplier for veterinarians.

He was a member of the Australian Senate for the state of Western Australia from 2013 to 2016, representing the Australian Labor Party. ==Education and career== Bullock was born in Sydney and was educated at Trinity Grammar, an Anglican school, and the University of Sydney. He was a friend of former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and suggested Abbott join the Liberal Party.Marr, David (2012), Political Animal: The making of Tony Abbott, Quarterly Essay, issue 47 Bullock moved to Western Australia and became Assistant Secretary of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) in 1986. He became Western Australian state secretary of the union in 1996. He was National Vice-President of the union from 2004 to 2014. The SDA is one of the largest unions affiliated to the Labor Party and is influential in the party's right-wing faction. ==Political career== As state secretary of the SDA, Bullock wielded considerable power in the WA branch of the Labor Party. He was influential in blocking Labor support of Sunday trading in WA, which the SDA opposes. He also unsuccessfully opposed changing Labor's policy to support same-sex marriage. Bullock ran for the state Legislative Assembly at the 1994 Helena by-election, caused by the resignation of former Labor minister Gordon Hill. The Labor Party suffered a negative swing of 2.3 points, which was enough to cost them the seat. Richard Court's Liberal government became the first state government since 1943 to increase their majority at a by-election. In the lead-up to the 2013 Australian federal election Bullock reportedly secured a deal with the secretary of United Voice, Dave Kelly, whereby Bullock would take the number one position from left- aligned Senator Louise Pratt in exchange for Kelly's choice of Sue Lines to fill the Senate seat vacated by Chris Evans. Bullock was elected to the Senate as the lead candidate on Labor's ticket in Western Australia, but in February 2014 the High Court of Australia ruled the election void. A special election to elect Western Australia's senators was held on 5 April 2014, with Bullock again being elected. His term commenced on 1 July 2014. On 1 March 2016, Bullock announced that he was resigning from the Senate after less than two years in the parliament. He cited the Labor Party's policy to bind parliamentary members to voting to support same-sex marriage after 2019, among other reasons, for his resignation. Bullock tendered his resignation to Senate President Stephen Parry on 13 April 2016.http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=243237 ==Controversy== The Labor member for Perth Alannah MacTiernan criticised Bullock for the power which he and other union secretaries wielded within the party, at the expense of ordinary members and union delegates. The former Labor member for Bassendean, Martin Whitely was also critical of Bullock for allegedly turning his back on a \\"welcome to country\\" ceremony, as well as his undue influence within the party, saying in Parliament \\"I frankly do not believe that Joe Bullock does much that is motivated by the interests of his members; I think Joe does what is in Joe's best interests\\". Whitely quit the Labor party in 2013 in protest over Bullock's pre-selection for the federal Senate election that year. During the campaign for the 2014 WA Senate election, details of Bullock's speech given at a function in November 2013 were made public. In the speech, Bullock criticised fellow senate candidate Louise Pratt and described some members of the Labor Party as \\"untrustworthy\\" and \\"mad.\\" Bullock issued an apology before the election. Bullock was blamed by figures from Labor's left faction for the party's poor showing in the Senate re-vote. United Voice, a left-wing union, called for Bullock to resign his Senate place. Alannah MacTiernan accused Bullock of costing the party votes. \\"There are booths that six months ago we were leading and now we're coming third,\\" she said. \\"We need people who can sell the message; we need to make sure we have people capable of inspiring people.\\" Former Senator Chris Evans said \\"there's no question that the Labor Party has a serious problem with its preselection processes, particularly in Western Australia.\\"https://newmatilda.com/2014/04/07/dont-blame-joe-bullock-labors- flop Pratt issued a statement saying: \\"It is a blow to progressive voters that I would be replaced in the Senate by someone who I have known for many years to be deeply homophobic, to be anti-choice and, [it] has recently emerged, disloyal to the very party he has been elected to represent. Far from my views on these issues being fringe as he has claimed, it is Joe Bullock and other members of the SDA leadership who are on the fringe of mainstream views.\\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/louise-pratt- lashes-deeply-homophobic-disloyal-labor-colleague-joe- bullock-20140416-zqvjm.html#ixzz36rncsqvy ==Personal life== Bullock is a member of the Anglican Church.

The Countess had allocated, for the times, the huge sum of 300,000 rubles. It purchased two adjacent plots of land so the building could stand facing Nowolipki street. Ludwik G√≥rski was the head of the church building committee, along with Aleksandra Potocka and Count Franciszek Czacki, among others. The designers of the church were Edward Cichocki and J√≥zef Huss. Construction started in 1891. The cornerstone was dedicated on October 20, 1892 by the Warsaw Archbishop Wincenty Teofil Popiel-Cho≈õciak accompanied by the auxiliary bishop of Warsaw, Kazimierz Ruszkiewicz. On 10 December 1896, the first Mass was celebrated in the new church by Archbishop Popiel-Cho≈õciak and Father Canon Ignacy Durewicz who dedicated the church. At that time, they were still working at equipping the interior. The church was consecrated by Bishop Ruszkiewicz in 1905. After the German creation of the Warsaw ghetto, the church was within its bounds, effectively closing it. Despite the official closure of the church, the home parish priest, Father Franciszek Garncarek and vicar Leon Wiƒôckowicz (or Wiƒôckiewicz) continued to live there. They took part in smuggling Jews, with a focus on Jewish converts to Catholicism, out of the ghetto. Father Garncarek was shot on the steps of a church outside the ghetto on 20 December 1943. Wiƒôckowicz was arrested on 3 December 1942 and deported to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, where he died on 4 August 1944. One source claims that Wiƒôckowicz was deported for aiding Jews, another for openly supporting some Christian Poles condemned to death. With the liquidation of the ghetto, the church was used as a warehouse in which property stolen from Jews was stored, then the church was converted into a stable. During the Warsaw Uprising the church tower was a vantage point and German machine gun nest. On 5 August 1944 the tower was damaged during the assault on the nearby Gesiowka prison by soldiers of Battalion Zo≈õka. After the uprising, Germans set fire to the roof of the church and a considerable amount of the church was burned. The fire also took the rectory and parish house. The Germans had a plan to blow up the church, but it was not realized. After the war, it was the highest and one of the few remaining buildings in the former ghetto. By 1947, with funds for the purpose of restoration by the Council of Churches of Warsaw Reconstruction, a facility was opened to the faithful, while renovations were still taking place. In 1953, vaults were plastered over the aisles and the bell restored. The church yard area was reduced because of emerging housing estates. ==The architecture of the church== The interior of the church. The church was built of red clinker brick with stone architectural details in brown-red and beige. There are three naves, in a basilica enriched with a high turret in the north-east corner. An elongated, closed choir is in the north- west. Flanking it are a couple of annexes with narrow antechambers: the north vestry and the south chapel. The two-storey facade is flanked to the left by a tower, and on the right by a chapel annex. Above the portico, resting on three arcades, is a strip of six semi-circular niches. The upper storey of the facade is filled with a large rosette. The facade is crowned by a triangular pediment. The nave and chancel are covered by a common roof gable. The interior is closed vaulting. The nave is lit by a pair of rosettes in each bay. Below them are a group of three windows opening to a space under pitched roofs. The interior has an applied alternating support system with the spans of the nave separated by pillars. Shank pilasters, extended walls of the nave are crowned with Corinthian capitals below the cornice. Between the pillars are placed pairs of arches supported on Romanesque columns. Dicing capitals are decorated with plant compositions. A choir is placed above the porch in a bay facade. It supports three Romanesque arches separated by a pair of semi- columns. The chancel has three bays, and is covered with a barrel vault. On the north side is the apse. Under the church is a vaulted basement. The neo- Romanesque church tower, at the time of building the highest in Warsaw (70 m), is topped with a cross 5.1 m tall located on a sphere with a diameter of 1.35 m. In 1959, this sphere, originally gilded, was painted black by the command of the authorities at the time. It was a reliable way of stopping the widespread rumors of a miraculous appearance on the ball of the Virgin Mary which caused a gathering of the faithful at the church. In 1995 the paint was removed from the sphere, restoring it to its former appearance. On the north wall of the church is a cross placed to celebrate entering the third millennium. On August 28, 2002 there was a dedication to the victims of the Pawiak prison by Father Monsignor Wies≈Çaw KƒÖdziela. ==The Parish== The parish has many communities and groups, including groups associated with the liturgy, the Legion of Mary, Rosary Wheels, a Neocatechumenal Way group, and an AA group. In the church basement a \\"Tea Room\\" hosts various cultural events, concerts, lectures and multimedia presentations. A film club is also held there. In 2006, the church also repaired the roof of the tower, damaged during World War II, bought an organ and the parish regained ownership of an adjacent square, which it had lost after the war. On 22 October 2006, the church was ceremonially lit. At the ceremony were Polish Primate J√≥zef Glemp and former Prime Minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz. In 2009, the main tower of the church was renovated. ===List of head parish priests=== The tomb of the first parish priest Fr. Canon Karol Czajkowski at PowƒÖzki Cemetery * Fr.

The crisis had several phases. First was the Cambodian Civil War between the Lon Nol government and the communist Khmer Rouge from 1970 to 1975. This phase was also marked by intensive United States bombing from 1969 to 1973 of the Khmer Rouge and sanctuaries and bases inside Cambodia of the North Vietnamese Army as part of its strategy to win the Vietnam War. The second phase was the rule of the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979. The Khmer Rouge murdered or starved about one-fourth of the 8 million Cambodian people. In 1979, Vietnam invaded Cambodia and overthrew the Khmer Rouge. Vietnam and the Cambodian government it created ruled the country for the next 12 years. The Khmer Rouge and other groups fought a guerrilla war against the Vietnamese occupiers and the Cambodian government. In 1979 and 1980, the chaos caused hundreds of thousands of Cambodians to rush to the border with Thailand to escape the violence and to avoid the famine which threatened Cambodia. Humanitarian organizations coped with the crisis with the \\"land bridge\\", one of the largest humanitarian aid efforts ever undertaken. From 1981 to 1991, the guerrilla war against the Vietnamese and Cambodian government continued and hundreds of thousands of Cambodians continued to reside in refugee camps in Thailand or on the border with Thailand. About 260,000 of the refugees were resettled abroad, more than one-half of them in the United States. The final phase of the Cambodian humanitarian crisis was its resolution in 1991-1993. Vietnam withdrew from the country and the United Nations led Cambodia toward an elected government and repatriated 360,000 Cambodians, emptying and closing the refugee camps. ==The civil war and U.S. bombing== In 1969, the United States began extensive bombing of North Vietnamese sanctuaries and bases, mostly in eastern Cambodia. The bombing later expanded to target the Khmer Rouge. During the same time period, the Khmer Rouge began its rise as an indigenous guerrilla force to challenge the government. The impact and interrelationship of the bombing and the growth of the Khmer Rouge is disputed by historians. On March 18, 1970, Lon Nol overthrew the government of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Lon Nol initiated an unsuccessful campaign to oust the soldiers and cut the supply lines of the North Vietnamese in Cambodia. In response, the NVA poured out of the sanctuaries and captured additional Cambodian territory. This territory was handed over the Khmer Rouge. Around the same time, US and South Vietnamese troops initiated the Cambodian Campaign to oust North Vietnamese troops from the sanctuaries. The humanitarian consequences of U.S. bombing were high. The U.S. may have dropped a tonnage of bombs on Cambodia nearly equal to all the bombs dropped by the U.S. in World War II. Estimates of Cambodian military and civilian deaths resulting from the 1969-1973 bombing range from 40,000 to more than 150,000.Marek Sliwinski, Le G√©nocide Khmer Rouge: Une Analyse D√©mographique (L'Harmattan, 1995), pp41-8.See also Heuveline, Patrick (2001). \\"The Demographic Analysis of Mortality in Cambodia,\\" in Forced Migration and Mortality, eds.

Quinn was later U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia The civil war forced many Cambodians in the countryside to flee to the cities for safety. The population of Phnom Penh increased from 600,000 to more than 2 million. Resupply of the city by land and sea was cut off by the Khmer Rouge and, by the time the government surrendered on April 17, 1975, many of the inhabitants were starving.Thompson, Larry Clinton Refugee Workers in the Indochina Exodus, 1975-1982 Jefferson, NC: MacFarland Publishing Company, 2010, pp. 34-38 During the civil war, 200,000 to 300,000 Cambodians died from all causes.Heuveline, Patrick (2001). \\"The Demographic Analysis of Mortality in Cambodia.\\" In Forced Migration and Mortality, eds.

Former civil servants and soldiers of the Lon Nol government were executed.United States, Congress, House. Human Rights in Cambodia 95th Congress,lst Session, Washington, DC: GPO, 1973, pp. 10-11 The death toll from execution, starvation, and disease during the almost four years of Khmer Rouge rule is usually estimated at between one and three million persons.Heuveline, Patrick \\"The Demographic Analysis of Mortality Crises: The Case of Cambodia, 1970-1979\\" in Forced Migration and Mortality Washington, DC: National Academies Press, 2001, p. 105 ==Vietnamese invasion and famine== On December 25, 1978, Vietnam invaded Cambodia and soon took over most of the country, establishing a pro-Vietnamese government to rule Cambodia, which they called the People's Republic of Kampuchea. Tens of thousands of Cambodians were killed in the invasion or executed by the new government.Etcheson, Craig, After the Killing Fields New York: Praeger, 2005, pp 24-27 The remnants of the Khmer Rouge retreated to the Cardamon Mountains near the border with Thailand and other resistance movements sprang up in western Cambodia. During the rule of the Khmer Rouge only a few thousand Cambodians had been able to escape Cambodia and take refuge in Thailand. With the Vietnamese invasion, the floodgates opened and Cambodians attempted to cross into Thailand in large numbers. In June 1979, the Thai government forced more than 40,000 Cambodian refugees back into Cambodia at Preah Vihear temple. 3,000 or more Cambodians were killed attempting to cross a minefield. The Preah Vihear incident stimulated the international humanitarian community into action to help Cambodians who often arrived at the Thai border in the last extremity of starvation.Thompson, pp. 177-178 By the end of 1979, Vietnamese offensives against the Khmer Rouge and other opposition groups plus a threatened famine in Cambodia had forced 750,000 people, many of them combatants against the Vietnamese, to the Thai border.Thompson, p. 200 Most were prevented from entering Thailand, but resided in makeshift camps along the border, although more than 100,000 were inside Thailand at Khao-I-Dang Holding Center. Many of the new arrivals were malnourished or starving.UNHCR, State of the World's Refugees, 2000 p. 93 ==The land bridge== Fighting between the Vietnamese and anti-Vietnamese forces disrupted Cambodian rice production in 1979. A country- wide famine was anticipated in 1980. Aid agencies estimated that up to 2.5 million Cambodians were at risk of starvation.Robinson, W. Courtland, Terms of Refuge London: Zed Books Ltd., 1998, p. 68 The pro-Vietnamese government in Phnom Penh demanded that all humanitarian aid be channeled through it, and some UN and aid organizations attempted to work with the government. However, there were reports of \\"delivery and distribution problems\\". The \\"land bridge\\", conceived by aid worker Robert Patrick Ashe, was a relief measure that bypassed the Phnom Penh government.Shawcross, William. The Quality of Mercy: Cambodia, Holocaust, and Modern Conscience. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1984. Humanitarian organizations and international aid agencies brought rice and other rice seed to Nong Chan Refugee Camp on the Cambodian border in Thailand and distributed the rice to Cambodians who came to the border. \\"Vast numbers of Cambodians with oxcarts and bicycles...came to the border every day\\" and were given sacks of rice to take home with them.\\"The Land Bridge\\" Forced Migration, accessed 21 Jan 2014 The land bridge was a \\"huge and successful operation,\\" distributing together with other aid operations, including rice distribution to occupants of urban Phnom Penh, about 150,000 metric tons of rice, other food, and rice seed to Cambodians from December 1979 to September 1980.Thompson, pp. 215-216 While the land bridge was successful in helping to avert what appeared to be an impending famine in Cambodia, it was controversial among aid agencies. Some aid agencies favored cooperation with the government in Phnom Penh and accused the land bridge of encouraging a black market in food and assisting anti-government forces, including the Khmer Rouge. The impact of the land bridge can not be fully measured as there was no means of monitoring the end use of the food it distributed.Robinson, p. 79 ==Resettlement and refugee camps== The border camps fluctuated in size during the 1980s depending upon the intensity of fighting inside Cambodia. Combatants took shelter in the border camps and both Vietnamese and Cambodian government forces frequently shelled the camps.UNHCR State of the World's Refugees, 2000, p. 95, accessed 20 Jan 2014 Meanwhile, at Khao-I-Dang and other refugee camps a few miles inside Thailand, Cambodians, mostly urban middle-class survivors of the Khmer Rouge, hoped for resettlement abroad. Khao-I-Dang reached a peak population of 160,000 in March 1980, but with resettlement, repatriation (sometimes involuntary), and transfer to other camps the population declined to 40,000 by December 1982 and the camp took on a status described as \\"the most elaborately serviced refugee camp in the world.\\" Site Two Refugee Camp grew to a population of 160,000 in 1987. Both refugee and border camps were characterized by fighting among political factions, violence, rape, depression, and inactivity. The refugee camps were declared closed to new arrivals by the government of Thailand, but Cambodians gained access through bribery or being smuggled into the camps.Robinson, p. 89-98; Mason, L. and R. Brown, Rice, Rivalry, and Politics: Managing Cambodian Relief. 1983, Notre Dame [Ind.]: University of Notre Dame Press, p. 88 Many of the Cambodians in the refugee and border camps remained there for years, fearful of returning to their country and desiring resettlement abroad. A total of 260,000 Cambodians would be resettled between 1975 and 1997, mostly in the United States (153,000) and France (53,000).Robinson, Appendix 2 ==Repatriation== In October 1991, a comprehensive peace agreement was reached between the contending parties in Cambodia which called for the withdrawal of Vietnamese military forces and the creation of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) with the responsibility of enforcing a ceasefire, organizing elections for a new Cambodian government, and repatriating Cambodians still in refugee camps in Thailand or in border camps.\\"United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), accessed 20 Jan 2014 UNHCR supervised the repatriation effort which resulted in 360,000 Cambodians returning to the country from refugee and border camps in Thailand. Khao-I-Dang and other refugee camps were closed. Their remaining population was transferred to Site Two which was closed in mid-1993 after its population was repatriated to CambodiaGrant M, Grant T, Fortune G, Horgan B.

He is a Democratic‚ÄìFarmer‚ÄìLabor (DFL) member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, representing District 60B in the central Twin Cities metropolitan area. He is also the director of the Confederation of Somali Community in Minnesota. ==Personal life== Noor was born between 1977 and 1978 in Somalia. Following the start of the civil war, he and his family sought asylum in Kenya. In 1999 they emigrated to the United States, settling in Minnesota. Noor earned a B.S. in computer science from the Metropolitan State University. He held a part-time job at Macy's while studying. Noor is the acting director of the Confederation of Somali Community in Minnesota, a Minneapolis-based NGO serving immigrants. Noor is Muslim. He is married to Farhiya Del, with whom he has four children. The family lives in Minneapolis's Cedar-Riverside neighborhood. ==Career== Noor is a computer scientist by training. He was a system administrator for the Minnesota Department of Human Services. Due to a law prohibiting state employees from campaigning, he later stepped down from the position. In 2010, Noor ran for a seat on the board of the Minneapolis Public Schools, finishing in fifth place. He was the runner-up in the next year's DFL Senate District 59 primary election. Noor's campaign was endorsed by the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers, Minnesota Association of Professional Employees, Stonewall DFL and Take Action Minnesota. In December 2013, he was appointed to the Minneapolis school board, beating out Ubah Jama on a 5-3 vote to replace the late Hussein Samatar. In February 2014, Noor challenged veteran state representative Phyllis Kahn for her seat, district 60B. Noor's policy priorities were job creation via investments in the green economy, health care issues, and forging partnerships with the University of Minnesota. Additionally, he sought to secure more funding for schools, advocated a move away from complete reliance on property taxes, and backed the state government's request for a waiver to get out of No Child Left Behind. He supported interment at Fort Snelling National Cemetery for Hmong veterans of the Vietnam War, as well as the Affordable Care Act. In contrast to the majority of his socially conservative constituents, Noor's campaign also supported same-sex marriage. He was endorsed by former Minneapolis mayor R. T. Rybak as well as several local progressive groups, including the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees, Stonewall DFL, and the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers. In the August 12 DFL primary, Noor lost to Kahn, receiving 1,949 votes (45.53 percent) to her 2,332 votes (54.47 percent). The primary challenge was reportedly one of Kahn's most difficult since her first election in 1972. In 2016, Noor again sought to challenge Kahn. Ilhan Omar defeated both of them in the DFL primary to become the nominee for the 2016 Minnesota House election for district 60B, and won the general election. In 2017, Noor ran for City Council in Minneapolis Ward 6.http://www.votenoor.com He lost narrowly to incumbent Abdi Warsame, after a recount. In 2018 Noor ran for Minnesota House of Representatives seat 60B again, as Ilhan Omar was running for U.S. Congress. Noor won both the Democratic primary and the general election. ==References * Official House of Representatives website * Category:1970s births Category:Living people Category:Ethnic Somali people Category:American people of Somali descent Category:Metropolitan State University alumni Category:Somalian emigrants to the United States Category:Politicians from Minneapolis Category:Members of the Minnesota House of Representatives Category:Minnesota Democrats Category:African-American Muslims Category:Somalian Muslims ","title":"Mohamud Noor"},{"id":"42016555","text":"Eda √ñzerkan (born March 11, 1984) is a Turkish actress.

He fought in the Napoleonic Wars and was taken prisoner in Russia in 1812. Destutt de Tracy was an opposition deputy during the subsequent Bourbon and Orleans monarchies. In the French Second Republic he was minister of Navy and Colonies from December 1848 to October 1849. He was strongly opposed to the seizure of power by Napoleon III, and left politics in 1852. ==Early years== Alexandre C√©sar Victor Charles Destutt de Tracy was born in Paris on 9 September 1781. His father was Antoine Destutt de Tracy, an aristocrat, philosopher and deputy in the Estates-General for Moulins, Allier. Victor Destutt de Tracy entered the √âcole Polytechnique in 1791, and graduated as an engineer. He was appointed lieutenant in 1800. In 1804 he was appointed second captain in the fourth sapper battalion. Destutt de Tracy served at Boulogne, with the French Army of Italy in Dalmatia, and in 1807 in the Engineering headquarters. Destutt de Tracy was appointed battalion commander in the 58th infantry in 1807. He was made aide-de-camp to General Sebastiani, ambassador to Constantinople, and followed him to Spain. He fought with distinction at the Battle of Almonacid (1809) and Battle of Albuera (1811), where he was wounded. He served in the French invasion of Russia of 1812, where he was taken prisoner and interned in Saint Petersburg. In 1814 Destutt de Tracy was freed in an exchange and promoted to colonel. In 1816 he married the widow of General Louis-Michel Letort de Lorville. He left the army in 1818 to pursue scientific studies. He was formally granted retirement as Staff Colonel of Infantry on 5 April 1820. ==Monarchy== On 5 August 1822 Destutt de Tracy was elected as deputy for the 2nd electoral district of Allier (Montlu√ßon) in a by-election. He sat on the far left next to Lafayette, whose son Georges Washington de La Fayette had married his sister Emilie de Tracy, and voted with the opposition. He ran for re-election on 25 February 1824 but did not succeed. On 17 November 1827 he was elected deputy for Moulins, Allier, and took his seat with the opposition. Destutt de Tracy was re-elected on 23 June 1830 and supported the establishment of the July Monarchy, but always maintained his independence of the royal party. He was made an Officer of the Legion of Honour in 1831. He was re-elected as deputy in 1831, 1834, 1838, 1839, 1842 and 1846. As a member of the opposition during the reign of Louis Philippe he was moderate but held strong moral opinions. He demanded abolition of the death penalty, abolition of the hereditary peerage, abolition of the slave trade and freedom of slaves, free education and the abandonment of Algeria. In 1841 he was appointed a member of the Board of Agriculture. ==Later political career== In the French Revolution of 1848 Destutt de Tracy was a colonel of the 1st legion of the National Guard of Paris. On 23 April 1848 he was elected to represent Orne in the Constituent Assembly, where he was a member of the Finance committee. Surprisingly, he voted for the banishment of the Orleans royal family. He voted for the abolition of the death penalty, but afterwards voted with the right. During the June Days Uprising (23‚Äì26 June 1848) he acted against the insurgents at the head of the 1st legion of the National Guard. When Prince Louis Napoleon was elected president, Destutt de Tracy was made Minister of the Navy and Colonies from 20 December 1848 to 2 June 1849. While he was in office slavery was abolished in the colonies. The death penalty for political crimes was also abolished. On 13 May 1849 Destutt de Tracy was elected representative for Orne in the Legislative Assembly. He continued as minister in the second cabinet of Odilon Barrot from 2 June 1849 to 31 October 1849, when he left office. In the Assembly he continued to vote with the monarchist majority, and was opposed to Napoleon's ambitions. He protested against the coup d'√©tat of 2 December 1851. In the elections of 29 February 1852 he ran for election to the Assembly as an independent candidate for the 2nd district of Orne, and was decisively defeated. Victor Destutt de Tracy left politics in 1852 and retired to Paray- le-Fr√©sil, Allier, where he took up agriculture. He died there on 13 March 1864, aged 82. ==References== Citations Sources * Category:1781 births Category:1864 deaths Category:Politicians from Paris Category:Party of Order politicians Category:Ministers of Marine and the Colonies Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies of the Bourbon Restoration Category:Members of the 1st Chamber of Deputies of the July Monarchy Category:Members of the 2nd Chamber of Deputies of the July Monarchy Category:Members of the 3rd Chamber of Deputies of the July Monarchy Category:Members of the 4th Chamber of Deputies of the July Monarchy Category:Members of the 5th Chamber of Deputies of the July Monarchy Category:Members of the 6th Chamber of Deputies of the July Monarchy Category:Members of the 7th Chamber of Deputies of the July Monarchy Category:Members of the 1848 Constituent Assembly Category:Members of the National Legislative Assembly of the French Second Republic Category:√âcole Polytechnique alumni ","title":"Victor Destutt de Tracy"},{"id":"42016798","text":"Easy Programming Language (EPL, ) is a visual compiled multilingualOfficial description proprietary programming language.

There is a tendency for such groups to develop their own approaches to Heathenry independently, assisted by networking groups and Internet communication. Thus most kindreds remain unaffiliated with one another while remaining in contact. The most evident forms of ritual practice among the British Heathen community are the Cup of Remembrance which entails the blessing of a horn of mead, some of which is offered as a sacrifice to the Gods by pouring it on to the ground (in the case of an outdoor rite) or into a sacred bowl containing soil of the motherland (in the case of an indoor rite).The Book of Rites, publ. by Odinist Fellowship, 2001 Other forms of ritual include the blot and sumbel. The first of these is a rite of offering, while the latter is a rite of toasting. The latter rite is typically more formal, while blot can be more simple, and performed without words. ==Demographics== In the United Kingdom Census 2001, 300 people registered as Heathen in England and Wales. However, many Heathens followed the advice of the Pagan Federation (PF) and simply described themselves as \\"Pagan\\", while other Heathens did not specify their religious beliefs. The 2011 census however made it possible to describe oneself as Pagan-Heathen (or any other chosen subgroup). The figures for England and Wales show 1,958 people self- identifying as Heathen. A further 251 described themselves as Reconstructionist and may include some people reconstructing Germanic paganism. The comparable figures for the UK as a whole in 2001 were 278 Heathen and 92 Asatru:Office for National Statistics, 11 December 2012, 2011 Census, Key Statistics for Local Authorities in England and Wales. Accessed 12 December 2012. ==Heathen groups== The Odinic Rite (OR) was founded in 1980 by John Yeowell, known as \\"Stubba\\".Minute Book of Odinic Rite On 24 February 1988 the Odinic Rite became the first polytheistic religious organisation to be granted Registered Charity status in England.Michael York (1997), Paganism and the British Charity Commission, paper given at the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion 1997 Annual Meeting - San Diego This led to allegations by the journalist Polly Toynbee that the Odinic Rite had presented Odinism as a monotheistic religion in order to gain acceptance by the Charity Commission,Polly Toynbee (1996). \\"A being that works in mysterious ways,\\" The Independent, 15 July 1996 an allegation strongly refuted by the Odinic Rite at the time. In 1990 a split occurred in the Rite. Two organisations were formed from the schism,York (1997) initially each calling themselves the \\"Odinic Rite\\". One used the postal addresses, BCM Runic, and continued to be known as Odinic Rite with the motto \\"Faith, Folk and Family\\".The Odinic Rite website, accessed 27 November 2011 The other, using the postal address of BM Edda, changed its name in 1998 to the Odinist Fellowship. The Odinist Fellowship remains registered as a charity to this day. The more hard-line Odinic Rite faction has been accused of racism or a racialist perspective on religion. The Odinist Fellowship has published its liturgy in The Book of Rites.The Book of Rites, publ. by Odinist Fellowship, 2001 It follows a ninefold calendar of festivals which include Yule (the Winter Solstice), Lindisfarne Day (8 January), Easter (Spring Equinox), Sigurd's Day (23 April), Hengest's Day (1 May), Midsummer (Summer Solstice), Odinist Martyrs' Day (29 July), Harvest Festival (Autumn Equinox), and Einheriar or Heroes' Day (11 November). Other publications include \\"All About Odinism - Your Questions Answered\\", the annual \\"Odinist Year Book\\", and \\"Is Wicca Pagan?\\", in addition to the regular \\"Round Robin\\" newsletters sent free to members. A Midsummer Gathering takes place annually at which members decide on and ratify policy in an open democratic fashion. Like many Odinists, the Odinist Fellowship advocates an ethical standard based on the eternal search for wisdom, following the example of Odin, and on the Nine Noble Virtues: Courage, Truth, Honour, Hospitality, Fidelity, Discipline, Self-Reliance, Industriousness, and Perseverance. Achievements of the Odinist Fellowship include the support given to an Odinist postal worker dismissed by his employer after thirty years' service for leaving printed images of Odin at his place of work. This led to a hearing in the Manchester Industrial Tribunal of Royal Mail PLC v Holden (2006) which found unequivocally in Mr. Holden's favour.Witches, Odin, and the English State: The Legal Reception of a Counter-Cultural Minority Religious Movement by G. J. Wheeler, Solicitor of the Senior Courts of England and Wales, 2018 In May 2014 the Odinist Fellowship purchased a Tudor-era chapel in Newark-on- Trent, Nottinghamshire, which was consecrated at Midsummer of that year as the first heathen Temple in England in over a thousand years. The Odinist Fellowship has announced its intention of establishing a nationwide network of Temples. The Newark Temple is managed by a registered charity, the Newark Odinist Temple Trust, and as a result of the registration of the Newark Odinist Temple as a place of worship under the Places of Worship Registration Act (1855) the Registration Office has included a new denomination of \\"Odinist\\" in its register. The Newark Odinist Temple has given a new impulse to heathen iconography with its unique display of sacred art. An annual gathering of Heathens in the UK called Heathenfest was held at Peterborough from 2005, it was organised by Woden's Hearth. Past speakers included Pete Jennings, Jenny Blain, Thorskegga Thorn and Stephen Pollington. However, this event is no longer extant. ==Organisation== Anthropologist Jenny Blain noted that by 2005, it was common for Pagan moots (regular social gatherings) to contain a small number of Heathens. However, many Odinists distance themselves from the wider Pagan movement, which they deem to have been too heavily dominated by practitioners of Wicca. Thus, there are few Odinist members of the Pagan Federation, although increasingly mutual links between Heathens and the Pagan Federation are being established. To this end the Pagan-Heathen symposium was established in order to foster support and dialogue between the rapidly diverging paths of heathenry and other neo-pagan sects. The internet also provided a factor in unifying the British Heathen movement, as websites such as UKHeathenry and Midgard's Web became increasingly popular in the early 21st century. The popularity of Asatru UK also owes much to this, the rise of social media has allowed heathens to connect more effectively. Heathens were also involved in the creation of the Association of Polytheist Traditions, as well as the creation and maintenance of the International Asatru Summer Camp (IASC), a loose coalition of real-world heathen groups across Europe. Asatru UK is a signatory of the IASC, along with its sister group, the Kith of the Tree and the Well. ==ReferencesFootnotes=Sources=== * Category:Neopaganism in the United Kingdom Category:Germanic neopaganism ","title":"Heathenry in the United Kingdom"},{"id":"42016857","text":"Leif √Öke M√∂ller (born April 11, 1958 in Lund, Sweden) is a retired Swedish Olympic sailor in the Star class.

He had two older brothers, Kraguj and Petar. Their father bought ammunition to the Serbian revolutionaries for all of his wealth, and the older brothers joined the fight. He was orphaned at an early age, and was taken in by the Monastery of St. Mark of Kori≈°a, where he learnt to read and write and was further educated. When he came of age, he took up working in a snuff factory, which was located along the Bistrica river in Prizren. Sima got a partner and started making capital doing this. In 1832 he married Sultane Drvareviƒá and had two children: a daughter (Mana), and a son (Manojlo). By 1836, Mahmud Pasha Rotulla had fallen in disfavor with the High Porte, and an imperial servant called Tangr-Oglu had come to Prizren to take over the Pasha's territory and rule it. He taxed all the snuff makers out of business. Sima Andrejeviƒá moved to Aleksinac where he tried to open another snuff factory, but it did not work out. He then moved to Monastir (Bitola) (in modern North Macedonia) to gather and sell leeches, but this business venture did not go well either because the Pasha of Monastir did not let him prosper. He sued the Pasha, and while the judicial proceedings were going on in Constantinople, Sima ‚Äì despaired and with no more financial reserves left ‚Äì risked it all and started trading in tobacco, which proved to be his calling. He made his fortune in tobacco trading in Constantinople and Odessa. He invested his fortune in building educational facilities for the common good. In 1872 he built a teachers' theological school in Prizren which produced a great number of theological students and teachers. In 1874, after the seminary had been opened, to honor the name of Sima Andrejevic, a marble plaque stating arrived from Belgrade stating: ‚ÄúThe deserving and honorable citizen of the magnificent city of Russia, St. Petersburg, Sima Andrejevic ‚Äì Igumanov, with origin from Prizren, builds for the benefit of his brothers, the orthodox Serb people, who live in his homeland, in eternal commemoration to himself ‚Äì in Prizren, August 10, 1872.‚ÄùPetar Kostic, Prosvetno-kulturni zivot pravoslavnih srba u Prizrenu i njegovoj okolini u XIX i pocetkom XX veka pg.44 He was awarded Order of the Cross of Takovo and Order of Prince Danilo I. ==Bibliography== * Vladimir Boban, Sima A Igumanov, Zivot i delo, NUB \\"Ivo Andric,\\" Pristina-Beograd, 2004 * Petar Kostic, Prosvetno-kulturni zivot pravoslavnih srba u Prizrenu i njegovoj okolini u XIX i pocetkom XX veka == References == Category:1804 births Category:1882 deaths Category:19th-century Serbian people Category:Members of the Serbian Learned Society Category:Kosovo Serbs Category:People from Prizren Category:People from Kosovo Vilayet Category:People from the Principality of Serbia Category:Serbian merchants Category:Ottoman merchants Category:19th-century businesspeople of the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Sima Igumanov"},{"id":"42016929","text":"American States Water Co.

It lived during the Upper Cambrian in what are today Canada and the United States. == Description == The outline of the exoskeleton Orygmaspis is inverted egg- shaped, with a parabolic headshield (or cephalon less than twice as wide as long. The well-defined central raised area (or glabella), excluding the backward occipital ring, is ¬æ√ó as wide as long, moderately convex, truncate- tapering, with 3 pairs of shallow to obsolete lateral furrows. The occipital ring is well defined. The distance between the glabella and the border (or preglabellar field) is ¬±¬º√ó as long as the glabella. Eyes small to almost medium, 12-20% of the length of the cephalon, positioned between the front and the middle of the glabella and about ‚Öì as far out as the glabella is wide. The remaining parts of the cephalon, called fixed and free cheeks (or fixigenae and librigenae) are flat. The fracture lines (or sutures) that in moulting separate the librigenae from the fixigenae are divergent just in front of the eyes, becoming parallel near the border furrow and strongly convergent at the margin. From the back of the eyes the sutures are bending out, than in, diverging outward and backward at approximately 45¬∞, cutting the posterior margin well within the inner bend of the spine (or opisthoparian sutures). The articulating middle part of the body (or thorax) has 12 segments. The anteriormost segment gradually narrows into a sideward directed point, while further to the back the spines are directed outward and the spine is of increasing length up until the ninth, while the spine on the tenth segment is abruptly much smaller, and 11 and 12 even more so. The small tailshield (or pygidium) is about ‚Öì√ó as wide as the cephalon, narrowly transverse about 2√ó wider than long. Its axis is slightly wider than the pleural fields to each side, and has up to 4 axial rings and a terminal and almost reaches the margin. Up to 4 pleural segments with obsolete interpleural grooves and shallow pleural furrows. The posterior margin has 3 or 4 pairs of spines, getting smaller further to the back. The surface has fine granules or is smooth. == Taxonomy == O. llanoensis and O. firma seem to represent the extremes in morphology of a continuous grade. == Distribution == * O. llanoensis was discovered in the Upper Cambrian of the United States (Morgan Creek Member, Wilburns Formation, Central Texas; Taenocephalus-zone, Murray County, Arbuckle Mountains, Oklahoma; Montana; Wyoming). * O. calvilimbata occurs in the Upper Cambrian of the United States (Tomah member, Friendship Mound, Wisconsin). * O. contracta is found in the Upper Cambrian of the United States (Honey Creek Limestone Central Oklahoma; Tomah member, Lone Rock Formation, White Creek, Wisconsin;). == References == Category:Anomocaroidea Category:Asaphida genera Category:Cambrian trilobites Category:Fossils of Canada Category:Fossils of the United States Category:Paleozoic life of Alberta Category:Paleozoic life of Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Paleozoic life of Yukon ","title":"Orygmaspis"},{"id":"42017005","text":"Karoline Nemetz (married name: Ettemark; born 28 June 1958) is a Swedish former middle- and long-distance runner.

The group received some media coverage, including a feature article in Rip Magazine and a video clip for the song \\"John Doe\\" being aired on the Headbanger's Ball program on MTV, but by 1993, the group split up. Since 2006, Frank Ferrer has been a member of Guns N' Roses (replacing Bryan Mantia)‚Äîsupplying drums on the songs \\"Chinese Democracy\\", \\"Better\\", \\"If the World\\", \\"There Was a Time\\" and \\"I.R.S.\\" on their 2008 album, Chinese Democracy, and touring throughout the world with the band. After the Beautiful and prior to joining Guns N' Roses, Ferrer also played drums for a variety of acts, including The Psychedelic Furs, Perry Farrell, Wyclef Jean and Tool, among others. The musical style of the Beautiful has been described as \\"A mix of Jane's Addiction at their most wistful and the broody flowery sway of Saigon Kick. Ultra-cool without having to try, it manages to glint but always remain exquisite from a far and is happy to lace its edges with darkness.\\" In 2012, Lacey gave this update about what he and his former band mates were up to via a posting on YouTube: \\"The three of us sunk our lives into the band. Many many miles in that Ford Econoline van. Frank is in Guns N' Roses now, Perry is a proud and wonderful father of a very accomplished cellist and I am fronting a RnB party/show band.

At the age of seven, she began training under Carlo Blasis. After she married her dancing partner Francesco Rosati, she was known as Carolina Rosati. == Career == In 1841, Rosati danced as prima ballerina at the Teatro Apollo in Rome. Two years later she appeared in Trieste and Parma. She danced at La Scala, Milan together with her husband in 1846. The same year she danced Jules Perrot's Pas de Quatre at Her Majesty's Theatre, London, where she also danced Fiorita et la Reine des Elfrides (1848) and La Prima ballerina (1849) which Paul Taglioni had created for her. She began dancing in Paris in 1851 appearing in a dance sequence in Fromental Hal√©vy's opera La Tempesta. Two years later, after she had danced in Joseph Mazilier's Jovita, ou les Boucaniers, she was engaged by the Paris Opera as their latest star, apparently becoming the highest paid dancer at the time. She created roles in several of Mazilier's ballets in which her sense of drama was revealed to the full, as when she played Amalia in La Fonti (1855) or her highly successful M√©dora in Le Corsaire (1856). Above all, she received great acclaim in Marco Spada (1857) where she appeared with Amalia Ferraris. When her rival Angelina Fioretti arrived in Paris in 1879, she left for St Petersburg's Imperial Theatre where she appeared in Jovita and in ballets created for her by Arthur Saint-L√©on and Th√©ophile Gautier. In 1862, she danced Aspicia in Marius Petipa's The Pharaoh's Daughter. She also danced all the great classical roles in Paquita, Giselle, Le Cheval de Bronze, La Somnabule and La Esmeralda. She retired in 1862 and died in Cannes in May 1905. == Assessment == The Oxford Dictionary of Dance describes her as \\"A plump, vivacious, and graceful dancer ... renowned for the precision of her pointe work, also for her expressive mime.\\" == References == Category:1826 births Category:1905 deaths Category:Italian female dancers Category:People from Bologna Category:Prima ballerinas Rosati Category:19th-century ballet dancers ","title":"Carolina Rosati"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function D(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const F=d(B,[["render",D]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/45.md","filePath":"people/45.md"}'),H={name:"people/45.md"},N=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(F)]))}});export{L as __pageData,N as default};
