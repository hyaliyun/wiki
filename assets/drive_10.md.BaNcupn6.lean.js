One of his tutors was Carl von Clausewitz. Aged 16, the prince fought in the Battle of Leipzig. The prince first entered the Netherlands in December 1813. As he spoke no Dutch, the prince was sent to Leiden University to get a further education. He was also educated by Karl Ludwig von Phull in The Hague. When Napoleon returned from Elba, during the Hundred Days the prince was given command of a detachment of Wellington's army which was posted in a fall back position near Braine-le-Comte should the battle taking place at Waterloo be lost. ==Prince of the Netherlands== Based on a house treaty, Frederick was to inherit the family's German possessions upon his father's death. After the treaty of Vienna these were no longer in the possession of the family. He instead was made heir to the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg. In 1816, Frederick relinquished this claim in exchange for land in the Netherlands and the title of Prince of the Netherlands. As a further compensation he received a yearly amount of 190,000 Dutch guilder. This made him the wealthiest member of the House of Orange-Nassau. With the money he bought a large estate in Germany, which made him the largest land owner from the Netherlands. In 1826 Frederick was appointed Commissary-general of the Department of War. In this office, Frederick reorganized the army on a Prussian model. Frederick founded the Royal military academy in Breda and reequipped the army with modern weapons. In 1829 Frederick was a for the Greek throne, but he declined because he did not want to be king of a country whose language and traditions were foreign to him. When the Belgian Revolution broke out in 1830, Frederick commanded the troops sent to Brussels to suppress the rebellion there. Frederick led these troops in several days of fighting in Brussels, but could not retake the city. Frederick also took part in his brother's 1831 Ten Days' Campaign in Belgium. Schloss Muskau Muskau Park When his father abdicated in 1840, Frederick withdrew from public life to his estates at Wassenaar. In 1846 he acquired Schloss Muskau in Prussia where he completed Muskau Park, the largest and one of the most famous English gardens in Central Europe, stretching along both sides of the present German–Polish border on the Lusatian Neisse. The park had been laid out from 1815 onwards at the behest of Prince Hermann von Pückler- Muskau (1785–1871). In July 2004, Muskau Park was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Upon the death of his elder brother in 1849, the country was left with a large debt. Frederick managed to pay off a million guilder to Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, who was brother-in-law to William II. The new King William III of the Netherlands (Frederick's nephew) did not want to inherent the kingship from his father, but Frederick managed to convince him to take up the position, offering to assist him. William III recalled Frederick and made him Inspector-General of the army. Frederick held that office until 1868, when he resigned because of the lack of support for his plans to modernize the army. Frederick managed to prevent a divorce between King William III and Queen Sophie of Württemberg by establishing a legal separation. He retired to Muskau Castle which was remodeled in Renaissance revival style between 1863 and 1866. ==Marriage== Prince Frederick married in Berlin on 21 May 1825 his first cousin Louise, daughter of Frederick William III of Prussia.

Originally consisting of Hero and Rocket, Larry was quickly added to the band. After some shuffling, the band members settled into their positions: Hero on bass and lead vocals, Rocket on drums, and Larry on lead guitar. ===Early career=== In August 1997, the band started approaching their music from a more ministry-oriented standpoint. One of the results of this change in view was the decision of Brian to become a Christian. Originally performing in a side project known as The Wedgeez, Brian was asked to play second guitar for The Rockers, and began performing with them in November 1999. After recording their first album, T.I.N. (Time is Now) in February 1998, the band began a forty-day prayer fast, hoping to be signed by one of the many record labels they had contacted. On the thirty-seventh day, Screaming Giant Records (home of Lugnut) contacted the band, claiming that they wanted to sign the band \\"yesterday.\\" The label's exuberance led to the band's first national tour. The band was also featured on the Trinity Broadcasting Network program G-Rock, giving them international exposure. Because of this national and international exposure, the band would sell ten thousand copies of T.I.N. The lead singer, Hero, considers the band to be one of the last bands of the \\"pre-Internet\\" generation. The band initially contacted Screaming Giant because they saw their name in a zine, and like other bands of their time, were often touring \\"blindly,\\" with no contact with a venue other than a few phone calls. In 1999, after several tours, Brian left the band and settled down. The band continued as a three-piece. They toured throughout the summer of 1999, and recorded their second album, Madison Road, as a trio. While touring to support the album, Jason Roach joined as the new rhythm guitarist. Shortly after, Larry Rox quit, and \\"The Name\\" joined to play keyboards for the group. After a few months, \\"The Name\\" left the band. Mitchell Gooden joined as the band's new rhythm guitarist, and the band began touring again. Around this time, Hero met his wife on a Rockers tour at a show in Mississippi, and they now perform together under the name Justin Hero. ===Late career=== In 2000, the band began to form a new style, and as a result they left Screaming Giant Records. They re-formed under the name Heaven not Spaceward, and after releasing one E.P., broke up to pursue other interests. In 2002, the band briefly regrouped as a trio (consisting of Hero, Rocket, and Mitch) and released a free E.P. and toured throughout the Southeast. This was a final farewell for Rockers fans. ==References== * ==External links== *Official Site Official website for the now defunct band *Myspace The band's Myspace *bandcamp site The bands band camp site.

He was reported as being amidst the throng of trapped passengers on the ship's rear deck in its final moments of descent, audibly praying. ==Life== Thomas Byles was born Roussel Davids Byles in Leeds, Yorkshire, the eldest of seven children of the Reverend Alfred Holden Byles, a Congregationalist minister, and his wife Louisa Davids. He attended Leamington College and Rossall School, Fleetwood, Lancashire, between 1885 and 1889, then went to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1889 to study theology, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1894. While at Oxford, Byles converted to the Church of England, and later, like his younger brother William had done before, to the Roman Catholic faith, taking the name Thomas. In 1899, he went to the Beda College in Rome to study for the priesthood and was ordained in 1902. He was assigned to St Helen's Parish in Chipping Ongar, Essex in 1905, where he would remain until his death. An invitation to officiate at the wedding of his younger brother William prompted Byles to make the trip to New York City. He said Mass on the morning of the sinking, Octave of Easter, 14 April 1912, for both second- and third-class passengers in their respective lounges. The sermon was on, the need for a spiritual lifeboat in the shape of prayer and the sacraments when in danger of spiritual shipwreck in times of temptation. Father Byles stained glass window Byles was walking on the upper deck praying his breviary when the Titanic struck the iceberg. As the ship was sinking, he assisted many third-class passengers up to the boat deck to the lifeboats. He reputedly twice refused a place on a lifeboat. Toward the end he recited the Rosary and other prayers, heard confessions and gave Absolution to more than a hundred passengers who remained trapped on the stern of the ship after all of the lifeboats had been launched. His body, if recovered, was never identified. His brothers installed a door in his memory at St Helen's Catholic Church in Chipping Ongar, Essex. Pope Pius X later described Byles as a \\"martyr for the Church\\". ==Beatification process== In April 2015, Graham Smith, the current priest of St Helen's Church, with support of Bishop Alan Williams of the Diocese of Brentwood, initiated the first steps toward making Byles a saint. ==In popular culture== Byles has three times been portrayed in films about the disaster. In the 1979 television movie S.O.S. Titanic, he was portrayed by Matthew Guinness. In the 1997 film, Titanic, he was portrayed by James Lancaster, reciting the Rosary and Revelation 21:4. Richard Basehart plays a thinly disguised Byles in the 1953 film. His story is featured in a book written by Cady Crosby entitled A Titanic Hero: Thomas Byles. The book documents Byles' early life, his years in ministry and his final hours on board the RMS Titanic. ==References== ==External links== * Website dedicated to Father Thomas Byles * Encyclopedia Titanica * Titanic Memorial * Titanic: A Voyage of Discovery * Category:1870 births Category:1912 deaths Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Anglicanism Category:Victims of the RMS Titanic Category:20th-century English Roman Catholic priests Category:People educated at Rossall School Category:Clergy from Leeds Category:People from Chipping Ongar ","title":"Thomas Byles"},{"id":"7819937","text":"The \\"Watch Valley\\" covers all the Swiss Jura Arc, from Geneva to Basel, and is the primary location of the Swiss watch-making industry.

Laws framed by humans cannot persist and only the laws of Allah shall prevail.\\" They have claimed responsibility for several violent attacks and bombings. JMB's communiqués reveal a Salafist doctrine that is common across international radical Islamist organisations. A 2005 leaflet proclaimed: > We are the soldiers of Allah. We have taken up arms for the implementation > of Allah's law the way the Prophet, Sahabis and heroic Mujahideen have > implemented for centuries.

JMB killed two judges in Jhalakathi in South Bangladesh on 14 November 2005. The group has also threatened journalists, with more than 55 receiving death threats between September and December 2005. Following an 8 December 2005 suicide bombing, Reuters reported the group threatened to kill women, including non-Muslims, who did not wear the hijab (veil).

The second tier, known as Gayeri Ehsar, has over 100,000 part-time activists. The third tier involves those who indirectly co-operate with the JMJB. According to JMJB leaders, the whole country has been divided into nine organisational divisions. Khulna, Barisal, Sylhet and Chittagong have an organisational divisional office each, while Dhaka has two divisional offices and Rajshahi three. The outfit also had committees in each village and, according to media reports, villagers were being forced to join the committees.

A complete set of Bangjja includes dishes, bowls, spoons, and chopsticks. The main difference between Korean bronzeware or Bangjja from other bronzeware is the alloy ratio between copper and tin. The Bangjja contains much more tin than other bronzewares (Cu:Sn = 78:22 as volume) while the normal ratio of tin to copper is 1/9. Due to this compositional difference, Bangjja (unlike other kinds of bronzeware) can be sterilized. For this reason, it has historically been used as tableware for the royal families of Korea. Bangjja is used for the traditional presentation of Korean royal court cuisine (surasang). In 1983, the government of South Korea has officially designated Bangjjaa as an Important Intangible Cultural Property. ==History== Bangjja brassware reflects its deep historical value as well as traditional fashion of Korea. The history of Bangjja originates from the Bronze Age and it was widely used to make a variety of tools and tableware. Ordos region's bronze culture related to Scythian Bronze Culture was spread and affected several regions including Korean territory. As the Bronze Age culture in Korea was influenced by Ordos region, where bronze culture was originated from the northern part of Siberia, Korean also produced ceremonial products such as ritual tools with bronze. During the period of the Goryeo dynasty when they frequently traded with China, royalties and nobles used thin bronze tableware made with Bangjja technique. In the period of Chosun dynasty, the country greatly supported mining and established many brassware plants in local territories. Although, people in this era generally used porcelains, upper-class people continued using brassware like Goryeo period. As time passed, even in the middle class, people started using brassware increasingly and it formed many markets across the country. In the end of modern age, most of brassware in all households got ravished by Japan. With the liberation in 1945, brassware became widely used again, but soon after Korean War, when briquettes took place, people preferred stainless bowls to brassware because brassware gets easily discolored by briquettes gas. In reversal, nowadays, through various chemical experiments, Bangjja brassware is becoming famous and known for its O-157 sterilization function, anti pathogen, and detection of pesticides. Also its heat retention rate turned out to be higher than porcelains and stainless bowls. Bangjja is currently used for making instruments, tableware, and other various goods such as household supplies. == Characteristics == When Bangjja brassware is made, a mass of alloy of copper and tin is heated with fire and gets hammered several times. The proportion of tin in Bangjja brassware is very high compared to general bronze bowls. First of all, mass of brass nugget is made by alloying copper and tin in ratio of 78:22, which is a golden ratio which permits no error at all. This alloying ratio is not possible in modern metallographic study because in today's practical products, the proportion of tin must be under 10 percent. Surprisingly, though Bangjja brassware has to be made with the ratio of 78:22. According to modern theology, the existence of Bangjja brassware is unexplainable. In addition, the robustness of Bangjja brassware is semi-permanent and its placid emotion reflected by its beautiful color is not comparable to any other bowl in the world. It is due to this golden ratio. The brassware cannot endure hammerings without this ratio. In general, iron becomes more firm when it is quenched after being heated in fire over 1 Celsius nectarine. However, Bangjja brassware becomes softer as it gets heated in fire. This is another mystery of brassware. Several people form a united circle around the mass of annoy and start hammering to make a form of plates. One special thing about the process is that they do not use ready-made mold machine, instead they repeat hammering and heating in fire as they are making the shape of brassware. == Today's Bangjja == Bangjja brassware produced by handed down traditional techniques till today are not bent or easily broken. Furthermore, with more usage, it becomes burnished without any discoloration. Recent reports about various experiments revealed that Bangjja brassware contains a sterilization function and detects pesticides. Bangjja brassware, now called \\"bowl of mystery\\" shows its great heat retention, which is far greater than other tableware made with other materials. Since Bangjja is completely free from toxicity, it is also commonly used as a material for percussion instruments like the tam-tam, hobnail, and gong. The sound of the instrument is totally dependent on one hammering of artisans at a time. Several people form a well organized group to produce Bangjja and it requires complicated and highly skilled techniques to be done, which makes Bangjja more distinctive. Bangjja products are used not only as simple household supplies, but also as work of art, which depicts the traditional custom of Korea. The value of Bangjja brassware is highly respected and it also has a profound mystery, which is unable to be explained by scientific knowledge because Bangjja brassware is the only metal product that is made by a craftsman. A Bangjja artisan Lee Bong-Ju, who was appointed as Important Intangible Cultural Property in 1983 is currently maintaining the root of Bangjja in South Korea. All of his various masterpieces are now exhibited at Dae-Gu Bangjja Brassware Museum. ==References== *General information about bangjja ** ** ** ** ** ** ==External links== *Official site of the Daegu Bangjja Museum *Brief info about bangjja and an artisan *Brief introduction and effects of Bangjja Brassware at 내성유기공방 Category:Korean art Category:Korean cuisine ","title":"Bangjja"},{"id":"7820084","text":"Dohrmann is a surname.

Occasionally, where there is not a specific article on a castle, links are given to another article that includes details, typically an article on a town. # Italics indicate links to articles in the

He also obtained good results as a fencer, winning the sabre prize in the International Contest held at Milano in 1908. In the late 1909, he moved to Paris, France. He studied in the Roche School for Aeronautics and Mechanic Constructions, graduating in engineering. In the same period he started to fly planes at the Issy-les-Moulineaux airfield. On January 1, 1911 he received the 35th piloting license in Italy. Later his aerobatic performances in Paris, riding a Farman biplane, led the French President Armand Fallières to declare him Le roi de l'air (\\"The King of the Air\\"). Cei died on March 28 of that year when his plane crashed on Rotschild Island near Puteaux. His funeral was celebrated by a large crowd in Paris.

The collection originally comprised thirty-four love poems, but two further poems were added before publication (\\"All day I hear the noise of waters\\" and \\"I hear an army charging upon the land\\"). ==Summary== Although it is widely reported that the title refers to the sound of urine tinkling in a chamber pot, this is a later Joycean embellishment, lending an earthiness to a title first suggested by his brother Stanislaus and which Joyce (by the time of publication) had come to dislike: \\"The reason I dislike Chamber Music as a title is that it is too complacent\\", he admitted to Arthur Symons in 1906. \\"I should prefer a title which repudiated the book without altogether disparaging it.\\"Ellmann, R. (Ed.), \\"Selected Letters of James Joyce\\", Faber, 1975. Richard Ellmann reports (from a 1949 conversation with Eva Joyce) that the chamberpot connotation has its origin in a visit he made, accompanied by Oliver Gogarty, to a young widow named Jenny in May 1904. The three of them drank porter while Joyce read manuscript versions of the poems aloud - and, at one point, Jenny retreated behind a screen to make use of a chamber pot. Gogarty commented, \\"There's a critic for you!\\". When Joyce later told this story to Stanislaus, his brother agreed that it was a \\"favourable omen\\".Ellmann, Richard. James Joyce, Oxford University Press, 1959, revised edition 1983. In Ulysses, Leopold Bloom reflects, \\"Chamber music. Could make a pun on that.\\"Joyce, J., \\"Ulysses\\", p.364, Bodley Head, 1960 In fact, the poetry of Chamber Music is not in the least bawdy, nor reminiscent of the sound of tinkling urine. Although the poems did not sell well (fewer than half of the original print run of 500 had been sold in the first year), they received some critical acclaim. Ezra Pound admired the \\"delicate temperament\\" of these early poems, while Yeats described \\"I hear an army charging upon the land\\" as \\"a technical and emotional masterpiece\\". In 1909, Joyce wrote to his wife, \\"When I wrote [Chamber Music], I was a lonely boy, walking about by myself at night and thinking that one day a girl would love me.\\" ==Musical adaptations== In a February 1907 letter to his brother Stanislaus, prior to the publication of Chamber Music, Joyce wrote: \\"...[]It is a young man's book. I felt like that. It is not a book of love-verses at all, I perceive. But some of them are pretty enough to be put to music. I hope someone will do so, someone that knows old English music such as I like. Besides they are not pretentious and have a certain grace.\\"Gilbert, S. (Ed.), \\"The Letters of James Joyce, Vol I\\", p.45, Viking, 1957. Today, although the individual poems of Chamber Music are less frequently anthologised than the later Pomes Penyeach, they continue to have - as Joyce hoped - an accessible lyricism which has led to a wide-ranging number of musical adaptations, including pieces by Samuel Barber, Karol Szymanowski, Luciano Berio, Ernest Moeran, Ross Lee Finney, http://www.james-joyce-music.com/songb_09_composer.htmlAleksandar Simić, Ivan Božičević, Israel Citkowitz, Robin Williamson, Dr. Strangely Strange, Syd Barrett, Oswaldo Gonzalez, Martyn Bates of Eyeless in Gaza, and Jim O'Rourke and Steve Shelley of Sonic Youth. In France, Nicolas Grenier and Torphy composed an ambient song about the collection. In 2008, Fire Records released a two-disc compilation featuring all thirty-six poems set to music by contemporary alternative acts, including Mercury Rev, Gravenhurst, Ed Harcourt, and Willy Mason. On Bloomsday 2017, Node Records released Goldenhair, featuring twenty-one of the thirty-six Chamber Music poems set to music by Irish composer, arranger, producer, and pianist Brian Byrne, performed by Kurt Elling, Glenn Close, Julian Lennon, Judith Hill, Keith Harkin, Andrew Strong, Gavin Friday, Curtis Stigers, Kate McGarry, Sara Gazarek, Kristina Train, Jack Lukeman, Cara Dillon, Declan O'Rourke, Lisa Lambe, Cara O'Sullivan, Balsam Range, and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra.

The siege of the aircraft lasted until 10 February. They were convicted of hijacking and false imprisonment in 2001 and sentenced to five years imprisonment, but their convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2003, because the trial judge's summing up made an error in law which might have misdirected the jury.

The International Organization for Standardization issued a standard for magnetic- resistant watches, which many countries have adopted. ==ISO 764 magnetic- resistant watches standard== The international standard ISO 764 Horology—Magnetic resistant watches defines the resistance of watches to magnetic fields. According to ISO 764 or its equivalent DIN 8309 (Deutsches Institut für Normung - German Institute for Standardization) a watch must resist exposure to a direct current magnetic field of 4,800 A/m. The watch must keep its accuracy to ±30 seconds/day as measured before the test in order to be acknowledged as a magnetic-resistant watch. Annex A of ISO 764 deals with watches designated as magnetic resistant with an additional indication of intensity of a magnetic field exceeding 4,800 A/m. There are two ways of building an anti-magnetic watch: * The first way consists of making the moving parts of alloys chosen to be insensitive to magnetic fields. These alloys include Invar (iron–nickel–carbon–chromium alloy), Glucydur (beryllium–bronze alloy), Nivarox (iron–nickel–chromium–titanium–beryllium alloy) and Elinvar (an alloy similar to Invar, though less resistant to magnetism and more resistant to thermal influence). These alloys are preferred by different watchmakers due to their differing properties. In the 1960s, almost all Swiss watches had Glucydur balance and Nivarox hairsprings. The anchors, escape wheels and other watch mechanisms were also made of non-magnetic metals or alloys. * Another way of making a watch non-magnetic is to house the entire movement into a case made of a highly permeable (magnetically conductive) material. The movement is covered by an additional soft-iron clasp to prevent the forming of magnetic fields inside the watch itself. ==History== The first recorded experiments in anti-magnetic watch-making are in 1846. Watchmakers from Vacheron Constantin were among the first to experiment with anti-magnetic features of a watch. However, they succeeded in assembling the first antimagnetic watch only several decades later. That watch was able to withstand magnetic fields because some of its parts were made of non-magnetic metals: the palladium-made balance wheel, balance spring and the lever shaft. In 1896 Charles Édouard Guillaume discovered the nickel based alloy Invar. Afterwards, in 1920, when he received the Nobel Prize in Physics, he developed another alloy - Elinvar. These alloys assisted in the assembly of anti- magnetic watches. Invar and Elinvar are able to resist magnetic fields, allowing the watch to continue to keep accurate time. The first anti-magnetic pocket watch was assembled by Vacheron Constantin in 1915. Later, in 1929, Tissot assembled the first ever non-magnetic wristwatch. ==Usage== Since their appearance, anti-magnetic watches have been favored by people who deal with high magnetic fields. They are widespread among electronic engineers and in other professions where strong magnetic fields are present. Today, even divers' watches (according to ISO 6425) must be anti-magnetic as well as being water resistant, sufficiently luminous, shock resistant and have solid straps. ==Contributions== New version of the Rolex Milgauss After discovering the alloys for assembling anti-magnetic watches, many watch-making brands utilize such materials in production in order to improve the performance of such timepieces. ===IWC=== In 1989 IWC first manufactured the Ingenieur Reference 3508, which was able to withstand huge magnetic fields of up to 500,000 A/m. ===Omega=== The Omega Anti-Magnetic Seamaster was announced 17 January 2013 (e.g. Seamaster Aqua Terra > 15,000 Gauss). According to the press release, the OMEGA movement does not rely on a protective container inside the watchcase but on the use of selected non-ferrous materials in the movement itself. The OMEGA prototype was subjected to 1.5 Tesla (15,000 gauss) and continued to perform. Testing showed that the watch was as accurate after its magnetic exposure as it had been before. ===Rolex=== The Rolex Milgauss series of antimagnetic certified chronometers was first manufactured in 1954 with the model 6541 for those working in nuclear, aircraft, and medical settings associated with strong magnetic fields. The watch has an advertised magnetic flux density resistance of 1 000 gauss within magnetic fields of 80 000 A/m. In 2007, after being out of production for nearly two decades a new Milgauss was introduced as the model number 116400. ==See also== * Watch * Diving watch * Shock-resistant watch * Water-resistant watch * Rolex Milgauss ==References== * ==External links== * Vacheron Constantin and Nonmagnetic Watches Category:Watches ","title":"Antimagnetic watch"},{"id":"7820308","text":"\\"Butterfly Caught\\" is a song on English trip hop collective Massive Attack's fourth full-length album, 100th Window.

The video was directed by South African Daniel Levi. == Track listing == ;CD (VSCDT1853) # \\"Butterfly Caught\\" (album version) – 7:35 # \\"Butterfly Caught\\" (Paul Daley remix) – 6:01 # \\"Butterfly Caught\\" (Octave One remix) – 7:21 # \\"Butterfly Caught\\" (RJD2 remix) – 4:29 # \\"Butterfly Caught\\" (Jagz Kooner remix) – 6:09 - additional vocals by Tara McDonald # \\"Butterfly Caught\\" (Version Point Five) – 5:49 # \\"Butterfly Caught\\" (video) – 4:23 ;2×12\\" (VST1853) # \\"Butterfly Caught\\" (album version) – 7:33 # \\"Butterfly Caught\\" (Paul Daley remix) – 5:58 # \\"Butterfly Caught\\" (Octave One remix) – 7:17 # \\"Butterfly Caught\\" (Paul Daley dub) – 4:54 # \\"Butterfly Caught\\" (RJD2 remix) – 4:26 # \\"Butterfly Caught\\" (RJD2 instrumental) – 4:23 # \\"Butterfly Caught\\" (Jagz Kooner remix) – 6:06 - additional vocals by Tara McDonald # \\"Butterfly Caught\\" (Version Point Five) – 5:45 == External links == * MASSIVEATTACK.IE song info entry on Butterfly Caught * Category:Massive Attack songs Category:2003 singles Category:Songs written by Robert Del Naja Category:2003 songs Category:Virgin Records singles Category:Songs written by Neil Davidge Category:Experimental rock songs Category:Alternative dance songs ","title":"Butterfly Caught"},{"id":"7820331","text":"Portrait Walter Simonds Franklin (November 6, 1799 - September 20, 1838) was a lawyer who practiced in Pennsylvania. He served as the seventh Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, from 1833 until his death in 1838. ==Personal life== ===Ancestry=== Franklin's parents were Samuel Rhoades Franklin and Sarah Simonds. His father was the son of Mary Rhoades, a daughter of Samuel Rhoades,The Snell biography spells their names with an extra 'e'. who had been a member of the First Continental Congress. His father's brother, Walter Franklin was a prominent Pennsylvania lawyer, later state Attorney General and state judge. ===Early life=== Franklin was born in New York, the only surviving child of his parents. As a teenager, he moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania to live with his uncle and namesake. Walter attended Litchfield Law School in Connecticut, where he met and, in 1821, married Sarah Buel. They moved to York, Pennsylvania, where Franklin practiced law. ===Children=== The Franklins had six children. Their eldest was William Buel, who was a major general in the Union Army during the American Civil War, and post-bellum was a civil engineer. Their second child was Samuel Rhoads, a rear admiral in the U. S. Navy, before, during, and after the Civil War. Their third child was Thomas, \\"apparently the black sheep of the family.\\" Their fourth child was Anne, who died, apparently, in childbirth. Their fifth child was Frederick Buel, who died in his twenties. Their sixth child was named the same as his father, Walter Simonds. He attended Harvard, served in the Union Army as a brevet lieutenant colonel, and post-bellum was a civil engineer and businessman. The summer before his death, Franklin wrote to Secretary of War Joel Poinsett requesting that his eldest son, then 15, be admitted to West Point the following summer. Poinsett refused. Franklin's sudden death that fall left the family almost penniless. At this point, Senator James Buchanan, a family friend, intervened, and convinced Poinsett to reverse his decision.Snell, pp. 4-9\\\\. W. B. Franklin graduated first in his class. ==Career== Franklin was named as Clerk for the Twenty-third United States Congress on December 2, 1833, and served for the next two congresses, dying in office of a sudden \\"malignant fever\\".

Lewis also undertook various consultancy roles in England and Australia. ===Duckworth-Lewis Method=== In the 1980s, Frank Duckworth had proposed a method of resetting targets in interrupted limited-overs cricket matches. After the 1992 Cricket World Cup, commentator Christopher Martin-Jenkins asked for a better calculation system. Lewis read Duckworth's 1992 paper Fair Play in Foul Weather and together they devised the Duckworth-Lewis Method. In 2014, Steven Stern became custodian of the method, and it was renamed the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method. ==References== ==External links== *Profile at Oxford Brookes University *Catalogue of Tony Lewis' papers concerning the D/L method, held at the Modern Records Centre, University of Warwick Category:1942 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Limited overs cricket Category:Academics of the University of the West of England, Bristol Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:English statisticians Category:Alumni of the University of Sheffield Category:People from Bolton Category:Academics of Oxford Brookes University ","title":"Tony Lewis (mathematician)"},{"id":"7820388","text":"Thomas Buxton may refer to: *Sir Fowell Buxton (Thomas Fowell Buxton, 1786–1845), MP and social reformer *Sir Fowell Buxton, 3rd Baronet (Thomas Fowell Buxton, 1837–1915), Governor of South Australia (1895–1899) *Sir Thomas Buxton, 4th Baronet (1865–1919), British aristocrat and philanthropist *Sir Thomas Buxton, 5th Baronet (1889–1945), of the Buxton baronets, High Sheriff of Essex *Sir Thomas Buxton, 6th Baronet (1925–1996), of the Buxton baronets *Thomas Buxton (New Zealand politician) (1863–1939), New Zealand MP *Thomas C.

The aim was to raise money for the starving people of Ethiopia. The idea of gathering artists together to make a charity record was copied from Bob Geldof's Band Aid project, which was number one in the UK charts at the time Starvation/Tam Tam was recorded in December 1984. Band Aid was criticised by some for featuring very few black musicians, and none at all from Africa. The Starvation/Tam Tam record was meant to rectify this. \\"Starvation\\", a cover version of a Pioneers song, featured a number of musicians associated with the 2 Tone era (the group were originally going to be called \\"The 2 Tone All Stars\\"), including members of The Specials, Madness, UB40 and General Public, as well as The Pioneers themselves. It was produced by Jerry Dammers and recorded at Liquidator Studios in London. \\"Tam Tam Pour L'Ethiopie\\" was recorded in Paris and featured an ensemble of African artists. Many of the musicians in question were from French-speaking countries, but lyrics in a number of African languages - including Douala, Lingala, Wolof, Malinke and Swahili - also featured on the record.

It is currently owned by the Swatch Group.Financial Times Article Nivarox is also the trade name of the metallic alloy from which its products are fabricated. Its notable property is that its coefficient of elasticity is remarkably constant with temperature. Nivarox is most famous for producing hairsprings that are attached to the balance wheel inside a mechanical watch movement, as well as mainsprings which provide the motive power for the watch. The Nivarox story began in 1933 when Dr. Straumann perfected the process of hairspring manufacturing in his Waldenbourg laboratory. FAR was the corporate name chosen in 1932 for the entity comprising several companies and subsidiaries located in Le Locle, Switzerland, manufacturing various watch components. ==Nivarox alloy== As a trade name, Nivarox is a German acronym for \\"Nicht variabel oxydfest\\" (G.) or \\"Non-Variable Non-Oxidizing\\" (E.). The Nivarox alloy is a nickel iron alloy used mainly in the watch industry for hairsprings for balance wheels, but also in other micro-machine industries and in certain medical equipment and surgical instruments, in the same category as Elinvar, Ni-Span, Vibralloy, and other similar alloys. The \\"non-variable\\" refers to the alloy's most notable property: that it has a low temperature coefficient of elasticity; its elasticity does not change much with temperature. There are several versions of the Nivarox alloy depending upon the intended application: Nivarox-CT, but also with suffixes CTC, M, W. Chemical compositions vary in wt% as follows for all Nivarox alloys : Iron as balance, a wide variation in nickel between 30-40%, beryllium 0.7-1%, some versions have molybdenum at 6-9% while others have instead chromium 8%, titanium is present in some compositions at 1%, manganese at 0.7-0.8%, silicon 0.1-0.2% and carbon in traces up to 0.2%.page 1 (in text p.216-217) of Subvolume I1 ‘Magnetic Alloys for Technical Applications.

Hairsprings made of this alloy have a spring constant which does not vary with temperature, allowing the watch's balance wheel, its timekeeping element, to keep better time. Along with the earlier alloy Elinvar, this alloy made obsolete the expensive compensation balance used in precision timepieces in the 19th century.Under the Loupe: The Hairspring Nivarox springs are now used by most watchmakers worldwide, with a global market share of 90%. The alloys also see limited use for specific components of sensitive scientific instruments. ==References== Category:Nickel alloys Category:Horology Category:Manufacturing companies of Switzerland ","title":"Nivarox"},{"id":"7820432","text":"Giuseppe Reichmuth (born 1944 in Affoltern am Albis, Canton of Zürich) is a Swiss painter and artist. He does not belong to a movement of art, because he chooses his style depending on his subject. Reichmuth's only fixed attribute is humour. == Life == The first and probably best-known painting is Zürich Eiszeit (English: Zurich ice age), which caused a scandal in 1975. It apocalyptically shows, in a photorealistic way, a frozen city of Zürich full of ice and snow: Ice age is loose, sheets of ice lie between old historical buildings. There is even a warship, that got stuck in the ice, and a group of penguins. If you look closely, you will notice the last \\"penguin\\" is actually something else... ;~) The work was interpreted as a criticism on the supposedly fossil and cold state of Zurich; a state, that the 1980s movement of youths and writers like Fritz Zorn criticised heavily, too. In a very similar way, the painting Dinosaurier auf der Autobahn (English: dinosaur on the freeway) was made. Afterwards, the style of Reichmuth started changing and became more and more miscellaneous. Reichmuth participated theatre projects in Baden, e.g. the Jerry Dental Kollekdoof. He got to know Ruedi Häusermann and did a lot of performances with him. In Bleu et gentil (1985) they dressed up like policemen and walked through the streets hand in hand. Also provocative was Reichmuthps painting of a vicious, smoking pope and the performance, that included hanging laundry on a lot of wires through the areaway of the university. In German, there is a figure of speech that says \\"dreckige Wäsche zu waschen\\" (\\"to wash dirty laundry\\"). Together with Roman Casanova, Reichmuth painted his Hin- und Herbilder: One of the two painted a picture, this picture was photocopied and sent to the other artist, who repainted it more or less (but never totally) and then copied again and sent it back – from March 1997 on until the end of 2003. The result is 83 paintings, that were exposed together. == Trivia == * Zürich Eiszeit was the cover image for the CD Swiss Kult Hits Vol. 2. * As Robert Gernhardt discovered one of Reichmuth's poems on the wall of a restroom, this was his proof, that \\"at least this work became common property\\". * Zürich Eiszeit became a popular motive of the 1980s juvenile riots in Zurich. * Dinosaurier auf der Autobahn made its way to the United States, where it was seen on posters, T-shirts and even a house wall. * After Reichmuth further paintings like Zürich Eiszeit were planned, which apply the same principle on other cities: e.g. a flooded New York City with streets deeply under water. But after finishing the time-consuming Zürich Eiszeit, Reichmuth has had it. Experts suppose, that Reichmuth has missed his chance to get rich, because he stopped making photorealistic catastrophe paintings. * His great grandson is Dustin Reichmuth an American songwriter. == Works == * Zürich Eiszeit, 1975 * Dinosaurier auf der Autobahn, 1980 * bleu et gentil (performance), 1985 * Word chains mounted on walls, e.g.: GURKENSALATTENTATOMEXPLOSIONANIERENWäRMER…. * Hin- und Her-Bilder (with Roman Casanova) == Literature == * Rea Brändle, Thomas Bodmer (authors) Peter Zimmermann (photos) Stephan Witschi, Roger Zoller (publisher): Giuseppe Reichmuth.

S&P; brought to KULF their \\"Not ready for Drive time Players\\", and their daily short production of \\"Star Trots\\" (modeled after Star Trek: The Motion Picture) with Captain James T. Shmirk, his trusted Lt. Bones, and their weird little robot, ACDC. In June 1982, Gannett Publishing, through its broadcast subsidiary, bought the station, announced to the employees that were left (S&P; had left for KEGL in the Dallas-Fort Worth market before the sale), on what was called \\"Black Friday\\" (July 2), that everyone was fired as of the following Monday, and relaunched it as top 40 station KKBQ (\\"79Q\\") on the 2nd. Program director John Lander hosted the morning show, called the \\"Q-Zoo\\", and took the station to the top of the Houston ratings after one rating period - a feat unheard of for an AM music station in the 1980s. KKBQ would add an FM simulcast on 92.9 FM on December 29, 1982. KKBQ was among the first AM stations in the city to broadcast in AM stereo, originally using the Kahn ISB system, and then later switching to the Motorola C-QUAM system. Programming on KKBQ and KKBQ-FM (\\"93Q\\") simulcasted until January 16, 1998, when the AM station became the adult standards-formatted \\"Star 790 KBME\\" (for \\"Best Music Ever\\", although a joke among employees was \\"Keep Bringing Me Exlax\\").Louis B.

The ESPN affiliation lasted until January 2007, when the network moved its programming to Cumulus Media-owned KFNC/97.5. At that point, KBME's sports talk programming shifted to a mix of local shows and programs from Fox Sports Radio, including the launch in late 2009 of \\"Matt & Adam in the Morning,\\" a morning show hosted by Matt Jackson and Adam Wexler, who both moved over from KILT.610's Wexler and Jackson moving to 790 sports radio, Houston Chronicle \\"Matt & Adam\\" became \\"The Big Show\\" in fall 2011, when Lance Zierlein joined Jackson and Wexler. Previous hosts on KBME include Brad Davies, Carl Dukes, Ted Deluca, John Lopez, David Dalati, Tom Franklin. ===Live sports programming=== Play-by-play coverage on KBME includes Houston Rockets basketball, Houston Astros baseball, Houston Cougars football and basketball, Texas A&M; Aggies football, basketball. KBME also features live national sports broadcasts from Dial Global and Sports USA Radio Network. Beginning with the 2012-2013 season, KBME became flagship station to the NBA's Houston Rockets, with iHeartMedia (then known as Clear Channel Communications) acquiring the team's radio rights from CBS Radio-owned KILT.\\"Rockets shift radio allegiance from KILT to KBME,\\" from Houston Chronicle, 6/27/2012 In April 2013, KBME became the flagship station to Major League Baseball's Houston Astros, with broadcasts moving from sister station KTRH.\\"Astros switch radio flagship to KBME,\\" from Houston Chronicle, 2/5/2013 For an interim period, games were simulcast on both stations.

It is typically between 41 and 46 cm in length, making it a medium-sized raptor. It breeds in Manchuria, Korea and Japan ; it winters in South-east Asia. It is a bird of open land. It eats lizards, small mammals and large insects. The adult has a grey head, breast and neck, white throat, black moustaches and mesial stripes, brown back and upperwings, and brown bars on white underparts and underwings. The juvenile is brown and mottled above, pale below with brown streaks, and has a broad white supercilium and brown face. ==Description== The males and females of the grey faced buzzard are the same in coloration. Adults are red & brown on the upper part of the chest while the chest is brown or dark brown. The chest contains dark down bars across the abdomen. The most infrequent color scheme is the full brown bird's also known as dark morph colored. The medium-sized raptor is typically between 41 and 46 cm long. Wings are pointed and narrow; feathers are thin and look transparent when in flight. the tail is ashy brown with horizontal bars on the tail, the iris is bright yellow. Juveniles are often less reddish, with dark brown bars on the abdomen. Also, the face and eye color is Brown with a buff color. ==Habitat== The majority of the species are found in Japan or more specifically, Satoyama. The area consists of many different environments; woodlands, paddy-fields, streams, and grasslands. In its breeding range, the buzzard is found in coniferous and mixed evergreen forests in mountains, at forest edges, fields, meadows, marshes, and around agricultural lands. ==Behavior and feeding== During the breeding season the male buzzards spend up to 90% of their day perched searching for prey. Their hunting perch us usually located around 500 meters away from the nest. They feed on frogs, crustaceans, lizards, insects, small rodents and occasionally other birds. They perch on a tree or a utility pole adjacent to an open habitat, such as rice fields, cropland, and clearings, and swoop down to capture with their feet small animals occurring in Satoyama. They have adopted a search and ambush hunting method to waste less time and energy but still receive enough to survive. The birds actively change its diets to fit the foraging site of a particular season. The main vegetation types which characterized to foraging areas of the buzzards varied over the course of the breeding season from paddy fields to levees and grass- arable fields, and eventually to wooded areas. Along with this shift, the main prey of the buzzards changed from frogs to insects. In paddy fields, frogs and small mammals are frequently captured. A variety of prey including frogs, small mammals, lizards, snakes and insects were taken at levees and grass- arable fields. Insects and frogs were captured in woodland areas. ==Breeding== During the breeding season the grey faced buzzard builds a small stick nest placed in a tree. The tree most of the time being a Japanese tree. In China, nests were typically located in dense coniferous or broad-leafed forest patches with thick shrubs, steep slopes, and a northerly slope aspect. The nest is lined with grass and leaves. Clutch size is 3-4 white eggs with rusty or reddish-brown spots. They breed in eastern China, eastern Russia, Japan, and in winter mainly in Indochina, Malaysia and the Philippines. The same nest is sometimes used every year until the need of reconstruction arises. Females mostly incubate eggs and nestlings. Males relieve females briefly a few times a day. Eggs hatch from late May to early June about a month after they were laid. Nestlings fledge from late June to Early July about 35 days after hatching. Fledglings are fed by the parent birds around the nest for about two weeks, and then become independent, starting to move a long distance. ==Migration== Grey-faced buzzards utilize the world's only oceanic flyway for raptor migration. Wind support and geographic features (i.e. islands) enable the birds to migrate in an oceanic flyway . Grey-faced Buzzards arrive in the breeding grounds of Japan from late March to early April. It is assumed that males arrive in the breeding grounds and wait for the female to arrive, while defending their territory. After the female arrives then, nest building and copulation begin. Grey faced buzzards set out on their autumn migration and head south in flocks from late September to mid-October. In Taiwan they are a common spring and summer migrant, and a few remain for the winter on Lanyu Island. As with most buzzards, these birds utilize rising air currents to gain altitude and cover great distances by soaring during migration. Taiwan lies on a major migration route for the Grey faced buzzard, and large numbers may be seen moving southward in October along the Hengchun Peninsula, and northward in late March and early April along the terraced mountains of Taichung and Changhua. ==Human interaction== Historically, the greatest threat to the Grey- faced buzzard in Taiwan has been the uncontrolled hunting of the species in the Baguashan and Hengchun Peninsula areas. Hunting and trapping of grey-faced buzzard in the Baguashan and Hengchun Peninsula areas has gone on for Generations. The Wild Bird Society of Japan and other concerned organizations successfully brought about legislation in Japan that effectively put an end to the importation of raptor skins and the demand for Taiwan grey faced buzzard skins faded. Grey-faced buzzards were designated as a \\"Vulnerable\\" species in December 2006 in Japan. Few concrete protective measures have been taken, however, partly because about 90% of the breeding grounds are privately owned and 75% are not legally protected for wildlife. A basic plan for \\"Creating a wood Grey-faced buzzards can live\\" by Toyota City of Aichi Pref. is remarkable. In the Toyota natural Observation Woods, which contain a Satoyama Landscape with Yatsuda, Toyota City has taken the initiative in creating the habitat of frogs grey-faced buzzards prey on and maintaining their foraging grounds by weeding and water management of private fallow rice fields. The conservation of birds of prey with large home range, such as grey-faced buzzards would be promoted by the active involvement of local and regional governments in maintaining an entire local ecosystem including private land in various regions of Japan. ==References== ==External links== * Migrating grey- faced buzzards in Taiwan, with photographs. * The Wild Bird Society of Japan grey-faced buzzard Category:Birds of Japan Category:Birds of Korea Category:Birds of Manchuria grey-faced buzzard ","title":"Grey-faced buzzard"},{"id":"7820565","text":"Złota Kaczka (Polish for \\"Gold Duck\\") is a mythical creature popular in the folk-lore of Warsaw, Poland.Encyklopedia Polski, p. 791. ==Story== According to one story, recorded by poet-journalist Artur Oppman, the duck dwells in the cellars beneath Warsaw's Ostrogski Castle (now home to the Fryderyk Chopin Museum).

A Swindon stalwart, Allen originally joined the club in 1895 as a member of the club's committee. Two years later, he joined the board of directors, before he took control of team affairs prior to the 1902-03 season, becoming the Town's first recognised manager. In an era where the board would have had control over team selection, Allen's job mainly involved assembling a capable team. Slowly but surely, it was a job he did well - turning a team who hadn't yet finished in the top half of the Southern League table, into championship contenders. By signing Swindon greats such as Jock Walker and Harold Fleming, Allen led the club during one of the most successful spells in their history. Between 1908 and 1914, Swindon won the Southern League title twice, finished as runners-up three times, and reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup twice - as well as winning the Dubonnet Cup. Unfortunately, the First World War interrupted Swindon's success, and by the time football resumed in 1919, Allen again had to virtually recreate the side. After a disappointing first season following the hostilities, the Town joined the Football League in 1920, becoming a founder member of Division Three (South). Over the next eight seasons, Swindon finished in the top six in every season bar one - but with only one promotion spot, they failed to get out of the division. Allen again highlighted his eye for a player with his signing of Harry Morris - the club's record goalscorer, and over this period, the Town recorded their two biggest victories - 9-1 vs Luton Town in their first league match, and 10-1 vs Farnham in the FA Cup in 1925. From 1929, Swindon fell into a gradual decline - not helped by the board's insistence on selling players to balance the books. Allen was obviously not pleased with this, and, after the Town were forced to apply for re-election in 1933, he willingly relinquished his team responsibilities, reverting to a secretarial position. This moved allowed the board to appoint Ted Vizard as the club's first full-time team manager, in the modern sense of the word. Amazingly, Allen remained as Swindon's secretary for thirteen more years, taking his total length of service to 51 years. He received the Football League's long service award in 1941, as he kept the club alive during World War Two, when the Town, unlike other clubs, completely closed down for the duration. He died whilst still in office, on 1 January 1946 - the report of his funeral covering three columns in the Evening Advertiser.

The highway is sometimes known as Dick Pond Road near the Socastee area. The route begins at U.S. Route 17 Business (US 17 Business) in Surfside Beach and ends at US 501 Business in Red Hill, near Conway. South Carolina Highway 544 is one of the most frequently traversed highways in the Myrtle Beach area. It runs in a south-north direction and parallels US 501 for most of its route. ==History== South Carolina Highway 544 going over the Intracoastal Waterway in Socastee Part of the current routing of SC 544 was the first route between Conway and Myrtle Beach, built in the late 1930s. When the Intracoastal Waterway was dug, the Socastee Swing Bridge in Socastee, South Carolina was also built. US 501 was signed on this route from Conway running south to Socastee. At Socastee, the road followed an east-west direction along the current route of SC 707 through Socastee, continuing through the area that is currently the Myrtle Beach International Airport, and ending near downtown Myrtle Beach on the road that is now Broadway Street. A more direct (and wider) route running diagonally between Conway and Myrtle Beach was built in the early 1960s, replacing a disused road through the former Conway Bombing and Gunnery Range. US 501 was signed on this path, and SC 544 and SC 707 were created to replace the old route of US 501.http://www.gribblenation.com/scroads/sc-us/sc317-1980.jpg A new bridge to be used in addition to the Socastee Swing Bridge was built in 1993. At that time, SC 544 was routed on this new road, and the former road was named Dick Pond Road in reference to a former lake near the intersection of US 17 Business and the route. Public meetings by the South Carolina Department of Transportation took place in September 1999 to discuss the widening of SC 544 to a four-lane highway from US 501 in Conway to the Intracoastal Waterway, including sidewalks and gutters throughout most of the route.

The term is named after the German mathematician Rudolf Lipschitz. ==Definition== Let n \\\\in \\\\mathbb N. Let \\\\Omega be a domain of \\\\mathbb R^n and let \\\\partial\\\\Omega denote the boundary of \\\\Omega. Then \\\\Omega is called a Lipschitz domain if for every point p \\\\in \\\\partial\\\\Omega there exists a hyperplane H of dimension n-1 through p, a Lipschitz-continuous function g : H \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb R over that hyperplane, and reals r > 0 and h > 0 such that * \\\\Omega \\\\cap C = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{x + y \\\\vec{n} \\\\mid x \\\\in B_r(p) \\\\cap H,\\\\ -h < y < g(x) \\\\right\\\\\\\\} * (\\\\partial\\\\Omega) \\\\cap C = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{x + y \\\\vec{n} \\\\mid x \\\\in B_r(p) \\\\cap H,\\\\ g(x) = y \\\\right\\\\\\\\} where :\\\\vec{n} is a unit vector that is normal to H, :B_{r} (p) := \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\\\mid \\\\ x - p \\\\ < r \\\\\\\\} is the open ball of radius r, :C := \\\\left\\\\\\\\{x + y \\\\vec{n} \\\\mid x \\\\in B_r(p) \\\\cap H,\\\\ -h < y < h \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. In other words, at each point of its boundary, \\\\Omega is locally the set of points located above the graph of some Lipschitz function. == Generalization == A more general notion is that of weakly Lipschitz domains, which are domains whose boundary is locally flattable by a bilipschitz mapping. Lipschitz domains in the sense above are sometimes called strongly Lipschitz by contrast with weakly Lipschitz domains. A domain \\\\Omega is weakly Lipschitz if for every point p \\\\in \\\\partial\\\\Omega, there exists a radius r > 0 and a map l_p : B_r(p) \\\\rightarrow Q such that * l_p is a bijection; * l_p and l_p^{-1} are both Lipschitz continuous functions; * l_p\\\\left( \\\\partial\\\\Omega \\\\cap B_r(p) \\\\right) = Q_0; * l_p\\\\left( \\\\Omega \\\\cap B_r(p) \\\\right) = Q_+; where Q denotes the unit ball B_1(0) in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} and :Q_{0} := \\\\\\\\{(x_{1}, \\\\ldots, x_{n}) \\\\in Q \\\\mid x_{n} = 0 \\\\\\\\}; :Q_{+} := \\\\\\\\{(x_{1}, \\\\ldots, x_{n}) \\\\in Q \\\\mid x_{n} > 0 \\\\\\\\}. A (strongly) Lipschitz domain is always a weakly Lipschitz domain but the converse is not true. An example of weakly Lipschitz domains that fails to be a strongly Lipschitz domain is given by the two-bricks domain Werner Licht, M. \\"Smoothed Projections over Weakly Lipschitz Domains\\", arXiv, 2016. ==Applications of Lipschitz domains== Many of the Sobolev embedding theorems require that the domain of study be a Lipschitz domain. Consequently, many partial differential equations and variational problems are defined on Lipschitz domains. ==References== * Category:Geometry Category:Lipschitz maps Category:Sobolev spaces ","title":"Lipschitz domain"},{"id":"7820624","text":"KEYH (850 kHz \\"La Ranchera 850 AM y 101.7 FM\\") is a commercial AM radio station in Houston, Texas.

The all-news format did not generate many listeners so talk shows were added. KEYH's slogan was \\"The Key to Houston\\" and featured a long key with the station's 850 dial setting and call sign featured in its logo. KEYH struggled to gain footing in the market and began airing Mexican music on weekends, while continuing the news/talk format weekdays. With Houston's growing Mexican-American population, the Spanish-language music featured on the weekends proved popular.

In 1987 he participated in the soundtrack of the German horror film Nekromantik, followed in 1989 by music to the movie Der Todesking and in 1990 to Nekromantik 2. Unlike the early song material that tends to be intimist and voluntarily drawing on the kitsch side, his film scores create uneasy and haunting atmospheres, weaving atonal strings, slow motion rhythms, moog synthesizers and plain noise into soundtrack form. In 2007, Hermann Kopp released “Psicofonico”, abstract violin soundscapes influenced by a Spanish documentary on the Electronic Voice Phenomena. In 2007 he got signed to the German label Galakthorrö, known for its releases of industrial music, maintaining his own morbid musical language. Cooperations with other musicians comprise the Italian artists Lorenzo Abattoir and Bathory Legion, the British act Am Not, the British doomcore band Fifth Era and the German project Schattenspiel. Hermann Kopp has had releases on the following labels throughout his career: * Passiv * Red Stream * Vinyl On Demand * Bataille * Galakthorrö * Aesthetic Records * 4iB Records * Alien Passengers ==In Other Media== In the movie Der Todesking Hermann Kopp plays a part as a man drowning himself in his bathtub.

He studied geology under R. A. Daly at Harvard University, a period that was interrupted by service in the US Navy during the First World War. After meeting his future wife, Elizabeth Buchner, he chose to study for his doctorate at the University of Chicago, close to her Milwaukee home. There he worked alongside J. Harlan Bretz, Rollin D. Salisbury and Rollin T. Chamberlin (son of Thomas Chamberlin) on the structural geology of the Rocky Mountains, receiving his degree in 1922. ==Career== At the University of Illinois he became in 1922 a geology instructor and was eventually promoted to full professor in 1939; he formally resigned his professorship in 1945, although he moved with his family to California in February 1942. A fortuitous spell using a yacht belonging to his father, the head of Shepard Steamship Line, turned Shepard in the direction of marine geology. Examining the distribution of sediments on the New England shelf, he found evidence of the role of sea level change in the evolution of shelves. After a sabbatical in 1933–1934 spent studying submarine canyons off the coast of California, Shepard in 1937 took another leave (lasting for a year and a half) from the University of Illinois and moved his family and two of his graduate students, Robert S. Dietz and Kenneth O. Emery, to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. There his work focused on the shelves off California and the Gulf of California, and the processes that shaped them. Submarine canyons, he suggested, were initially carved by rivers when sea levels were lower during the recent Pleistocene epoch. In the Second World War, Shepard again worked for the US Navy, where his expertise and knowledge of seafloors was used to assist submarine operations. At the Scripps Institute he became in 1945 a professor of submarine geology and retired from teaching in 1966. Shepard became director of an American Petroleum Institute project, studying sedimentation in the northern Gulf of Mexico between 1951 and 1960 (API Project 51). Although officially retiring in 1966, Shepard continued to work, even after illness had forced him to remain at home. ==Awards and honours== During his career Shepard received both the Wollaston Medal from the Geological Society of London (1966) and the Sorby Medal from the International Association of Sedimentologists (1978). Since 1967, the Society for Sedimentary Geology have awarded the Francis P. Shepard Medal for Marine Geology in recognition of \\"Excellence in Marine Geology\\". ==References== ==External links== * Autobiography, Scripps Institution of Oceanography * Biographical entry, Scripps Institution of Oceanography * Biographical entry, Geological Society of America * Biographical entry, Encyclopædia Britannica * Wollaston Medal winners, Geological Society of London * Sorby Medal winners, International Association of Sedimentologists * P.

When she was 9 years old, her grandfather bought her a drum kit, and being an avid fan of rock and roll acts of the 1960s and 1970s, she began practicing rock music immediately and regularly. In 4th, 5th, and 6th grade, she was the drummer in the Prisk Elementary School orchestra. She proved to have a natural talent and quickly became a proficient drummer. By the age of 13, she was the only girl in local bands who played at teenage parties. Attended Edison High school in Huntington Beach California with actor Willie Aames, playing drums in school bands as Sandy Pesavento. At 15, she met Joan Jett and producer Kim Fowley co-created and formed the Runaways. ==The Runaways== Driven by her ambition to play professionally, she sought out fellow musicians and other industry contacts in southern California with the idea of forming an all-woman rock band. In 1975, she met producer Kim Fowley, who gave her the phone number of another young musician in the area, guitarist Joan Jett. Joan and Sandy met shortly thereafter. The women subsequently played for Fowley, who agreed to help them find other female musicians to round out the band, most notably Lita Ford and Cherie Currie. ==Post-Runaways years== After four years of recording and touring the world, the Runaways disbanded in 1979. West made varied attempts to continue her career as a professional musician, playing with other acts in southern California, releasing a solo ep, The Beat is Back, and forming the Sandy West Band. None of these ventures produced significant income, so West was forced to spend most of her post-Runaways years working outside music. West later claimed that ex-Runaways' manager/producer Kim Fowley had not paid the members of the band what they were entitled to. \\"I owe him my introduction to the music business but he's also the reason I'm broke now,\\" West said. West appeared in Edgeplay: A Film About the Runaways, a documentary about the Runaways produced and directed by the band's former bassist Victory Tischler- Blue, providing some of the more poignant interview segments, describing the things she needed to do post-Runaways for money. She worked mostly in construction, and spent a small amount of time as a bartender and a veterinary assistant. In other parts of the Edgeplay interviews, she alludes to the fact that she engaged in criminal activity in order to make ends meet (e.g., she describes how she had to break someone's arm for money they owed). West spent time in jail on multiple occasions following her career in the Runaways,Cherie Currie Vs. Lita Ford: The Runaways Reunion Fizzles http://joanjettbadrep.com/Interviews/2001/cherievslita.shtml which she alluded to in Edgeplay. ==Death== In 2005, West, a heavy smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer which later spread to her brain, and she died on October 21, 2006 at age 47. Former bandmate Joan Jett said, \\"We shared the dream of girls playing rock and roll. Sandy was an exuberant and powerful drummer,\\" adding, \\"I am overcome from the loss of my friend. I always told her we changed the world.\\" Cherie Currie said, \\"Sandy West was by far the greatest female drummer in the history of rock and roll. No one could compete or even come close to her, but the most important was her heart. Sandy West loved her fans, her friends and family almost to a fault. She would do absolutely anything for the people she loved. It will never be the same for me again to step on a stage, because Sandy West was the best and I will miss her forever.\\" ==Film== Sandy West was portrayed by actress Stella Maeve in the 2010 film The Runaways. The film also featured Kristen Stewart, Dakota Fanning and Scout Taylor-Compton, who portrayed Joan Jett, Cherie Currie and Lita Ford, respectively. During the audio commentary during the DVD extras, Joan Jett dedicated the film to her. ==Legacy== Time Magazine described West as a \\"pioneering rock drummer\\". ==Discography== ;Runaways albums * The Runaways (1976) *Queens of Noise (1977) *Live in Japan (1977) *Waitin' for the Night (1977) *And Now...

It was first constructed in 1935, and has no trapeze. The Pirate was designed in 1934 by the German boat builder Carl Martens. The boat was originally manufactured in solid wood, although since the 1960s glass-reinforced plastic, or a sandwich of the two, is also used. According to the regulations for this class of boat, kevlar and carbon fiber are forbidden. Approximately 6,000 boats have been built. The Pirate is a youth dinghy. It was formerly the only class used in German youth sailing championships. At present, the Pirate class is only registered in Germany. With more than 380 participants in the official rank list, it is one of the most active race classes in Germany. The Pirate is sailed by two persons, and measures 5.0 metres long by 1.6m across. The Pirate Class has also been used by the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets as a youth trainer. The maximum sail surface, comprising two sails, amounts to 10 m² according to the class regulations. Since the 1960s, spinnakers up to 10 m² are also permitted. The use of a Genoa or Gennaker is not permitted. The sails can be manufactured from cotton, linen or synthetic fabrics. Carbon fiber in the sails is forbidden, and may be used only as reinforcement in the windows of the sail. ==External links== * International Pirat Association * Deutsche Piraten-Klassenvereinigung e.V. – Germany * Österreichische Piraten-Klassenvereinigung – Austria * Schweizerische Piratenvereinigung _ Switzerland * Festival der Holzpiraten Website by Malte Storn, about Pirates, built from wood, annually Festival in Germany.

It was founded in 1789 by George Newton and Thomas Chambers. ==History== Building housing the headquarters of the Newton, Chambers & Co. George Newton and Thomas Chambers were partners in the Phoenix foundry at Snow Hill, Sheffield and along with Henry Longden they signed a lease to extract coal and ironstone from the Thorncliffe valley. The 21-year lease was signed in December 1793 and it gave them mining rights to the Thorncliffe valley from the Earl Fitzwilliam and set up their works on the Thorncliffe site near Chapeltown, to the north of Sheffield. The company built The Thorncliffe Ironworks beside the Blackburn Brook above the wooded valley slopes where the mining was to be carried out. The first blast furnace was completed in April 1795 and the second in 1796. The first had a capacity of 15 tons of metal a week, while the second could produce 20 tons. The two furnaces were in operation for 78 years before being replaced in the 1870s. Around this time – for the first ten years' of the partnership's existence – interest paid on capital was limited to five per cent per annum and the working partners drew only \\"modest\\" salaries of £80 per annum. This policy was intended to encourage the growth of the business, and it certainly enabled it to survive some periods of poor trading, but by the early 19th century the practice of mostly leaving accrued profits within the business led to disputes with some sleeping partners. In 1815 the partners met with William Murdoch, the inventor of coal-gas lighting, this being seen as providing a growth in work for their foundry. Coal, from the company's mines, was provided as charge for beehive coke ovens which were built on the site. By the end of the 19th century the company were not only mining coal and ironstone but building blast furnaces, coke ovens and chemical plant. Heavy section iron, cast in the foundry was used in two iconic structures: Tower Bridge, crossing the river Thames in London, and the Eddystone Lighthouse. During the 1890s, the company introduced its Izal disinfectant made from distilled coal tar. The name became well known for its use on a best-selling \\"medicated toilet paper\\" often found in schools and public lavatories, noted for its abrasive quality. According to the radio documentary Now Wash Your Hands, the reason for its ubiquity was because local authorities were given it as part of a bulk-purchasing agreement when ordering disinfectant. ==World War II== In 1939 the Thorncliffe works came under the control of the Admiralty. A new workshop was constructed at Warren Lane, a short distance away from the Thorncliffe works, which was used to build army vehicles and became the largest manufacturer of Churchill tanks for the war effort. One of the tanks used to stand at the side of the road near the factory until recently. William Joyce (Lord Haw Haw), in one of his radio broadcasts threatened to \\"dot the I\\" on the Izal name with a bomb. It was intended to destroy the source of the Churchill tanks. A near miss ensued, but the works remained intact. ==Post- war== The nationalisation of the coalmining and steel industries in 1948 saw the group forced to sell off its interests in these fields. However the company remained heavily involved in iron and steel founding and the production of chemicals from tar distillates, the basis of many products manufactured by its Izal subsidiary. The engineering part of the group designed and supplied all manner of process plant and equipment for the coal- gas, chemical and steel industries. ==Diversification== Before World War II they had started building excavators under licence from the American manufacturer Koehring and sold them under the NCK brand name. In 1958, the company acquired Ransomes & Rapier to become a major producer of excavators, draglines and other construction equipment. A new subsidiary company NCK- Rapier was formed, with production moving to Ipswich. In 1960, the company acquired Ronuk Ltd, a manufacturer of wax polishes and wood stains based in Portslade, Brighton and with it the Ronseal brand name. The group also set up Redfyre as a marketing company for coal-burning grates which were made in its foundry. Changes, in particular the Clean Air Act saw the company move into light fabrications and oil-fired central heating equipment, however, the oil- fired boiler market collapsed in autumn 1973 with the increase in prices. In 1972 the group was taken over by industrial holding company Central & Sheerwood. Central & Sheerwood was acquired by Robert Maxwell in the 1980s and became TransTec plc in 1991 after merging with Geoffrey Robinson's company Transfer Technology. TransTec went into receivership at the end of 1999. In 2001 Newton, Chambers & Co. had ceased trading and was dissolved; TransTec was dissolved the following year. == References == * Official Company handbook and catalogue * \\"Turnaround – Managerial recipes for strategic success\\".

Roepstorff studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen from 1994-2001 and Rutgers University, Mason School of Fine Art (MFA), USA (2000). In 2016 she was appointed to represent Denmark in the Danish Pavilion at the 57th International Art Exhibition—La Biennale di Venezia 2017, entitled “VIVA ARTE VIVA” and in 2018 her work are presented at Kunsthal Charlottenborg in the extensive solo exhibition Renaissance of the Night == Life and work == Central to Roepstorff's practice is an acute awareness of balance in its diversity of meanings - from disturbances in power structures of today's world to the human condition with principles of equilibrium in the mind-body. Driven by all which yearn to take form, Roepstorff uses aesthetics, with all it encompasses of incorporeal sensibility and bodily determination, as an entrance to subtler, more intangible aspects of everything that moves us - physically as well as mentally. Widely recognized for her early large-scale collages her juxtapositions of fragments hijack our visual culture into new imaginations. Marked by assemblages and layering, the collages encompass materials as fabrics, brass, wood and paper in order to direct attention to spaces in between, of cracks and potential possibilities. Following a more abstract vein, Roepstorff's mobiles, and the use of brass in general, hint a mythical dimension, hovering about cosmic vibrations. Algebraic in their language and with pure forms reminiscent of beings as water, suns and the two-legged, the mobiles suggest a wholeness. Assembled as pendulums the structures themselves are reliant on principles of balance. As a very recent string in a versatile practice, Roepstorff's \\"waterings\\" also indicates a layered process, a long repeated application of water and pigment often lasting for months. In this veil of dimness and translucent sedimentations lies an opening towards widespread interpretations, like large canvases of dreams. A current but profound preoccupation with darkness in all its shapes and spirits materialized itself most intensely at the 57thVenice Biennale where Roepstorff was appointed Danish national representative and made an extensive intervention in the Danish Pavilion. However, darkness as a transitory and regenerating force continues to determine an artistic direction generally concerned with exploring gaps, breaks and in-betweens. The task and challenge of today lie in a fundamental re-accentuation of the dark potentials, for darkness is beginnings: of art, of lives and of visions. Roepstorff's practice unfolds an ongoing endeavor to shed light on our shadows, to shape the shapeless and encapsulate time in its passing, coming and being. Essentially, our being stretches far into spaces of the immaterial, and art interweaves all these corners of our existence: from the fluid metaphysical realms of beyond to our bright and dim and tangible reality. == Collages == Roepstorff’s basis is collages incorporating media images that visualize existing power relations and critically deal with the history and failures of political ideas. By editing and decomposing the original material her works generate new contexts that open up spaces for negotiation and new narratives. The collages are often large using different materials like fabrics, photocopies, cuttings, foils, brass, wood and paper. “Her approach to collage can be seen as an experimental philosophical strategy. At the heart of it is the cutting-out of images, with the resulting positive and negative spaces carrying traces of the other. It’s from here that the artist has come up with her own slogan: ‘Everything matters, even if it doesn’t seem to.’ Pushing collage into wall-covering tableaux and expansive series with growing formal and narrative complexity, the artist builds drama on the wide scope of existing visual media representations. She incorporates images from the news as easily as historic material and advertising imagery, ‘appropri-arranging’ them in the process of photocopying, scaling, cropping, composing and editing the final work.” (Detta von Jouanne, Flash Art Online, 2010) ==Recent works == In the past 5-6 years Roepstorff has broadened her collage practice by incorporating sculptural elements into her work creating new visual and bodily engaging experiences. Her sculptures have mainly been made of concrete and brass. \\"The themes in my art are almost unchanged, but my approach has changed. My very young collages were also young people themselves. There was so much material and density of images, input and information that the viewer came to the same place as me. The spaces were few, but they were there and they were and are important. For space is space of potential, a state of uncertainty, balance and dis-balance, light and dark, the part of the structure that the interpretation may ooze from.” (Interview with Kirstine Roepstorff by Sara Thetmark, Kopenhagen Magasin, 2016) Balance is a key word for Roepstorff. Her works are often composed around horizontal lines whose divisions reflect different layers of consciousness. This is especially seen in her brass mobiles which Roepstorff denotes ‘Klangmennesker’ (Sound people) – “We're some kind of vibrational beings that are walking around, sometimes in unison, sometimes not. Whether we are able to go in harmony with our surroundings is very much about how our own inner sound is tuned.” (Interview with Kirstine Roepstorff by Sara Thetmark, Kopenhagen Magasin, 2016) ==Selected works == In recent years Roepstorff has created several large scale public art projects in Denmark, including \\"The Gong\\" for Dokk1 in Aarhus (2015) and \\"Klangfrø\\" for the Department of Nordic Studies and Linguistics at the University of Copenhagen (2014). In the spring of 2017 she completed a major decoration at the Sygehus Lillebælt Hospital in Kolding and when the new town hall in Middelfart was inaugurated in September 2017 it featured a large scale brass mobile by Roepstorff titled \\"Heart of the Whale\\". == 57th International Art Exhibition—La Biennale di Venezia 2017 == Roepstorff is appointed to represent Denmark at the Venice Biennale 2017. The decision of appointing her was made by Gitte Ørskou (chair), Lilibeth Cuenca Rasmussen, Bodil Nielsen and Jacob Tækker, The Danish Arts Foundation Committee of Visual Arts Project Funding. The Committee acts as commissioner and funds the Danish Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. For the Danish Pavilion in Venice, Roepstorff has developed the exhibition project INFLUENZA: Theatre of Glowing Darkness. Because we need to relearn. The exhibition will explore the metamorphosis that occurs between the destruction of the known and the embrace of the new. ”Kirstine Roepstorff stands as an artist for something special and unique, also in an international context”, says The Danish Arts Foundation Committee for Visual Arts Project Funding who acts as commissioner for the Danish Pavilion and has appointed Kirstine Roepstorff to represent Denmark at the Venice Biennale in 2017. ”Kirstine Roepstorff has an extensive and powerful backlist, major solo exhibitions, several large scale public art projects and international experience. Her artistic practice has had a huge impact on the Danish art scene in recent times and her works have the high quality and the stature required in Venice”, says Gitte Ørskou, chair of The Danish Arts Foundation Committee for Visual Arts Project Funding. For the so far largest survey and presentation of her work in Denmark, Kirstine Roepstorff has created the massive intervention \\"Renaissance of the Night\\", covering the entire south wing of Kunsthal Charlottenborg during the summer of 2018. The exhibition is both a continuation of Roepstorff's Venice project yet a widening and a renewal of the perspectives on darkness and its revitalizing potentials. == Other projects == * 2003: Outdoor Poster project, Brandenburg, DE * 2003: Picture feature in the ‘op ed’ of ‘Politiken’ Danish newspaper, DK * 2003: A4 gallery, initiated by the national broadcasting and television of Denmark, DK * 2005: Project for Deutsche Bank for Frieze Art Fair, London, UK * 2006: Home for Lost Ideas, book project by Catherine Griffiths and Daniele Rees * 2009: Scorpios garden (curator), Temporäre Kunsthalle, Berlin, DE (with catalogue) * 2016: Design for series of dresses for Stine Goya == Texts == * Kunitz, Daniel, The Power of Weakness: Kirstine Roepstorff’s Collage: It’s not the Eye of the Needle that Changed ‐ The Frame, Drawing Center, New York, 2007, exhibition catalogue. * Smith, Roberta, Just Enough Seriousness to Go Around, The New York Times, June 20, 2008. * Politit, Giancarlo, Focus: Painting, Dead Language or Cultural Terrorism?, Flash Art, December 2008. * Von Jouanne, Detta, It’s not the Eye of the Needle, Flash Art, October 5, 2010. * Ladewig, Rebekka, Do we wonder with the head and not with the heart...?

One of Bidloo's students was his nephew Nicolaas Bidloo, who would go on to become the personal physician of Russian czar Peter the Great, and also founded a medical school in Moscow. ==Life and career== Born into a Mennonite family of Amsterdam, the son and namesake of a hatter, he was the younger brother of the literary apothecary, Lambert Bidloo (1638-1724), a thorough classicist who saw to it that he had a requisite mastery of Latin as well as Dutch. Govert then began his apprenticeship in surgery and in 1670 became a student of the anatomist Frederik Ruysch. He then studied medicine at the University of Franeker, receiving his degree in 1682. In 1688 he became a lecturer of anatomical dissection in The Hague, and in 1690 he was appointed head of the national hospital service, a post he also held in England from 1692. In 1694 he became a professor of anatomy and medicine at the University of Leiden, a position he held until his death in 1713, when he was succeeded by Herman Boerhaave. ==Anatomia Hvmani Corporis, 1685== Nicolaes Maes,Six Governors of the Amsterdam Surgeons' Guild, 1680. Bidloo, 30, head turned, in foreground In 1685 he published an anatomical atlas, Anatomia Hvmani Corporis () (1690.) Anatomia Hvmani Corporis described papillary ridges on skin (fingerprints). This was one of the pioneering scientific observations which laid the foundation of forensic identification using fingerprints. The atlas was illustrated with 105 plates by Gerard de Lairesse, showing the human figure both in living attitudes and as dissected cadavers. The book was later plagiarized by English surgeon William Cowper for his Anatomy of the Humane Bodies (1698), which gave no credit to either Bidloo or de Lairesse. This led to a number of vitriolic exchanges between Bidloo and Cowper, including several pamphlets published in each anatomist's defense. Bidloo contributed to discovery of the life cycle of the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica. He observed worms of an identical anatomy in bile ducts of sheep, calves, deer and humans. He also observed the presence of eggs inside the body of an unknown worm, later recognized as F. hepatica. William III, Dutch stadholder and king of England, asked Bidloo to become his personal physician in 1695. The king died in his arms on 8 March 1702. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1696. He died, aged 64, in Leiden. ==Gallery== {  170px  170px  170px } ==References== ==Sources== *University of Glasgow *Biographisch anthologisch en critisch woordenboek der Nederduitsche dichters (Dutch) *Stichting Medisch en Farmaceutisch Museum De Griffioen (Dutch) ==External links== *US National Institutes of Health: Historical Anatomies on the Web Govert Bidloo's Anatomia Humani Corporis (Ontleding des menschelyken lichaams) *Godefridi Bidloo, Medicinae Doctoris & Chirurgi, Anatomia Hvmani Corporis: Centum & quinque Tabvlis Per artificiosiss.

The character is a sentient alien symbiote with an amorphous, liquid-like form, who survives by bonding with a host, usually human. This dual-life form receives enhanced powers and usually refers to itself as \\"Venom\\". The symbiote was originally introduced as a living alien costume in The Amazing Spider-Man #252 (May 1984), with a full first appearance as Venom in The Amazing Spider-Man #300 (May 1988). The Venom symbiote's first human host was Spider-Man, who eventually discovered its true nefarious nature and separated himself from the creature in The Amazing Spider-Man #258 (November 1984) — with a brief rejoining five months later in Web of Spider-Man #1. The symbiote went on to merge with other hosts, most notably Eddie Brock, its second and most infamous host, with whom it first became Venom. As one of Spider-Man's most enduring villains, Venom quickly established himself as one of his arch-enemies, with many regarding him as a dark reflection of Spider-Man. The character later became an anti-hero, working both with and against superheroes. Other notable hosts of the Venom symbiote include the villain Mac Gargan, formerly known as Scorpion, and Flash Thompson, who became the superhero Agent Venom. The character has been featured in various other media, including animated series, films, and video games. Most notably, he was portrayed by Topher Grace as one of the main antagonists of the film Spider-Man 3 (2007), and by Tom Hardy as the titular protagonist and antihero of the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters film Venom (2018) and its upcoming sequel, Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021). The Eddie Brock Incarnation of Venom was rated 33rd on Empire's 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters,33 Venom, \\"The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters\\", Empire, accessed July 2, 2011. and was the 22nd Greatest Villain on IGN's 100 Greatest Comic Villains of All Time. Comics journalist and historian Mike Conroy writes of the character: \\"What started out as a replacement costume for Spider-Man turned into one of the Marvel web-slinger's greatest nightmares\\".Conroy, Mike. 500 Comicbook Villains, p.358, Collins & Brown, 2004. ==Conception and creation== The original idea of a new costume for Spider-Man that would later become the character Venom was conceived by a Marvel Comics reader from Norridge, Illinois named Randy Schueller. In 1982, Jim Shooter, Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, sent Schueller a letter acknowledging Marvel's interest in the idea, which they ended up purchasing from him for $220.August 3, 1982 letter from Jim Shooter to Randy Schueller . Comic Book Resources. Retrieved November 21, 2011 Shooter came up with the idea of switching Spider-Man to a black-and-white costume, possibly influenced by the intended costume design for the new Spider-Woman; artist Mike Zeck designed it.David, Peter (June 4, 1993). \\"The Wacko Theory\\", Comics Buyer's Guide, Reprinted in the collection But I Digress (1994). pp. 104-106 Writer/artist John Byrne says on his website that he conceived a costume of self-healing biological material when he was the artist on Iron Fist — to explain how that character's costume was constantly being torn and then apparently repaired by the next issue. Byrne says explaining that he ended up not using the idea on that title, but that Roger Stern later asked him if he could use the idea for Spider-Man's alien costume. Stern in turn plotted the issue in which the costume first appeared but then left the title. It was writer Tom DeFalco and artist Ron Frenz who established that the costume was a sentient alien being that was vulnerable to high sonic energy during their run on The Amazing Spider-Man that preceded Michelinie's.Byrne, John. \\"How is it that JB \\"created\\" Venom?\\" . \\"Frequently Asked Questions\\". Byrne Robotics, accessed July 2, 2011. The symbiote was first introduced as Spider-man's new black costume in The Amazing Spider-Man #252 (May 1984) as part of a story called \\"Homecoming!\\" The story takes place after Spider-Man's return from the events of the miniseries Secret Wars, where he first obtains the black costume. The full first appearance of Venom is in The Amazing Spider-Man #300 (May 1988), after the symbiote bonds with Eddie Brock. ==Hosts== ===Spider- Man (Peter Parker)=== The Venom symbiote bonds to Spider-Man in Secret Wars #8. Art by Mike Zeck. The story of how Spider-Man gets his new black costume is recounted in Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #8 (December 1984), in which writer Jim Shooter and artist Mike Zeck depicted the heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe transported to another planet called Battleworld by a being called the Beyonder. After Spider-Man's costume is ruined from battles with the villains, he is directed by Thor and the Hulk to a room at the heroes' base where they inform him a machine can read his thoughts and instantly fabricate any type of clothing. Choosing a machine he believes to be the correct one, Spider-Man causes a black sphere to appear before him, which spreads over his body, dissolving the tattered old costume and covering his body to form a new black and white costume. To Spider-Man's surprise, the costume can mimic street clothes and provides a seemingly inexhaustible and stronger supply of webbing. During their run on The Amazing Spider-Man, writer Tom DeFalco and artist Ron Frenz established that the costume was a sentient alien symbiote that was vulnerable to both fire and high sonic energy. It was in that storyline that the costume would envelop Peter Parker while he slept, and go out at night to fight crime, leaving Parker inexplicably exhausted in the morning. Parker had the costume examined by Reed Richards, who discovered that it was alive, and when Parker realized it was trying to permanently bond to Parker's body, he rejected it, and it was subsequently contained by the Fantastic Four.Byrne, John. \\"How is it that JB \\"created\\" Venom?\\" . \\"Frequently Asked Questions\\". Byrne Robotics. Retrieved July 2, 2011. The symbiote escaped and bonded again to Parker, who used sound waves from a cathedral's church bell to repel it. But the symbiote had grown an emotional attachment to Peter so he willingly left Peter's unconscious body and moved him to safety before disappearing. In Go Down Swinging, when Norman Osborn got bonded to the Carnage symbiote, Spider-Man rebonds to the symbiote in an attempt to stop Osborn, now calling himself Red Goblin, while forgiving both Eddie and Venom for the past conflicts. He with the symbiote got a new costume design and they were overpowering Osborn, until Norman mortally injured Flash Thompson. This caused Spider-Man and the symbiote to get angry, eventually losing control, until Flash calmed them down with his dying breath. In the final battle Spider-Man tells the symbiote to leave him and that he himself is going to be all right while Norman also detaches himself from Carnage.Amazing Spider-Man #800. Marvel Comics. ===Eddie Brock=== David Michelinie would later write the backstory of Eddie Brock as the alien's new host that would become the villain Venom, using the events of Peter David's 1985 \\"Sin Eater\\" storyline in The Spectacular Spider-Man as a basis for Brock's origin. Venom's existence was first indicated in Web of Spider-Man #18 (September 1986), when he shoved Peter Parker in front of a subway train without Parker's spider-sense warning him, though only Brock's hand was seen on-panel. The next indication of Venom's existence was in Web of Spider-Man #24 (March 1987), when Parker climbed out of a high story window to change into Spider-Man, but found a black arm coming through the window and grabbing him, again without being warned by his spider-sense. After appearing in shadow in The Amazing Spider- Man #298 (March 1988), Venom made his cameo appearance on the last page of The Amazing Spider-Man #299 (April 1988), when he terrorized Parker's wife, Mary Jane Watson, and made his full appearance in The Amazing Spider-Man #300 (May 1988)., \\"Amazing Spider-man #300 Vol 1\\", Comics Price Guide, accessed March 3, 2015. Spider-Man would confront him in the following issue, when Brock reveals that he was a Daily Globe reporter who worked on the Sin-Eater case, and that his career was ruined when it was discovered that the man Brock announced as the Sin-Eater was a compulsive confessor. Forced to eke out a living writing lurid stories for venomous tabloids, Brock blamed Spider-Man for his predicament. He took up bodybuilding to reduce stress. It failed to do so, and Brock sank into a suicidal depression. Seeking solace at the church where Spider-Man repelled the symbiote, the symbiote—sensing Brock's hatred for Spider-Man—bonded with the disgraced reporter. Brock took on the name Venom in reference to the sensationalistic material he was forced to traffic in following his fall from grace. Over the years, as the symbiote gained more intelligence and moved to additional human hosts, the name began to apply to the symbiote as well as its hosts. As Venom, Brock fights Spider-Man many times, winning on several occasions. Venom repeatedly tries to kill Peter Parker/Spider-Man—both when the latter was in and out of costume. Thus Parker is forced to abandon his \\"black costume\\", which the symbiote had been mimicking, after Venom confronts Parker's wife Mary Jane. Venom escapes from the supervillain prison, The Vault, to torment Spider-Man and his family. The symbiote is finally rendered comatose after being subdued by Styx's plague virus, and Eddie Brock is subsequently placed in Ryker's Island Prison. When the symbiote recovers and returns to free Brock, it leaves a spawn to bond with Brock's psychotic serial-killer cellmate Cletus Kasady, who becomes Carnage. Meanwhile, Venom and Spider-Man fight on a deserted island, and Spider-Man strands Venom there after faking his own death. Soon after, however, Spider-Man brings Venom back to New York City in order to stop Carnage's killing spree. After being incarcerated once again, Venom is used to create five new symbiotes, which are all paired with human hosts. As well as helping Eddie Brock to seek continued revenge against Spider-Man, the symbiote also aids Brock in a sporadic career as a vigilante. He and the symbiote occasionally share a desire to protect innocent people from harm, even if it means working side-by-side with the hated Spider-Man. This is especially true when Venom combats the entity he believes to be his spawn, Carnage. When Spider-Man helps Venom save Brock's ex-wife Anne Weying, the two form a temporary truce, though this falls apart after Weying's suicide. The symbiote is temporarily stolen by U.S. Senator Steward Ward, who hopes to better understand his own alien infection by researching the symbiote before it returns to Brock. Now, however, it dominates its host, Brock, rather than vice versa.Peter Sanderson (w). Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider- Man. 2004 Eventually, Eddie Brock and the symbiote go their separate ways as the symbiote grows tired of having a diseased host and Eddie rejects its growing bloodlust, leading him to sell the symbiote at a super villain auction. The creature that would become Venom was born in the 998th generationVenom vs Carnage #1. Marvel Comics. to a race of extraterrestrial symbiotes, which lived by possessing the bodies of other life-forms. The parasites would endow their victims with enhanced physical abilities, at the cost of fatally draining them of adrenaline. According to the 1995 \\"Planet of the symbiotes\\" storyline, the Venom symbiote, after separated from its first host, was deemed insane by its own race after it was discovered that it desired to commit to its host rather than use it up. The symbiote was then imprisoned on Battleworld to ensure it did not pollute the species' gene pool. The symbiote bonds with its new host, Lee Price, launching volume 3 of the Venom comic book series. The series ran for six issues total (Nov. 2016-April 2017). Eddie Brock is able to regain the Venom symbiote at the conclusion of the series, returning the Venom comic book title to volume 1 with issue #150.Venom Vol. 3 #6. Marvel Comics. ===Scorpion (Mac Gargan)=== The Venom symbiote approached Mac Gargan, the villain formerly known as Scorpion, and offered him new abilities as the second Venom. Gargan bonded with the creature, which would later give him an extra edge as part of Norman Osborn's Sinister Twelve. As the Avengers dealt with the rest of the Twelve, Spider-Man swiftly defeated Gargan, even with these additional powers, which Spider-Man suggests is attributed to the fact that Mac Gargan does not hate Spider-Man as much as Eddie Brock did. Gargan later became a member of a sub-group of the Thunderbolts, which was drafted by the Avengers to hunt down the members of the fugitive New Avengers. It was then revealed that he had been outfitted with electrical implants by the government to keep the symbiote in check.Heroes for Hire Vol. 2 #2 When in the Venom persona, Gargan retained very little of his original personality and was controlled almost completely by the symbiote, which drove him to cannibalism. When the symbiote was dormant in his body, he expressed nausea and fear of the organism. During a fight with \\"Anti-Venom\\" (Eddie Brock), he and his symbiote were separated, and the Venom symbiote was nearly destroyed. Blobs of it still existed in his bloodstream, however, so Osborn injected Gargan with a vaccine for Anti-Venom's healing powers, which restored the symbiote by causing the remaining pieces of it to expand rapidly. Gargan dons a Scorpion battle armor over the symbiote while it heals, causing him to become what Spider-Man calls \\"Ven-orpion\\" although when the symbiote is fully restored it shatters the armor. After ingesting a chemical given to him by Norman Osborn, Venom transforms into a more human appearance similar to the Black-Suited Spider-Man. Osborn introduces him as The Amazing Spider-Man, a member of the Dark Avengers, while unveiling the team. After the Siege of Asgard, Gargan and most of the Dark Avengers were taken into custody. While being held on the Raft, the Venom symbiote was forcefully removed from him, ending his run as Venom. ===Flash Thompson=== On December 9, 2010, Marvel Comics announced a new \\"black ops\\" Venom owned by the government. This new Venom was featured in a new series called Venom in March 2011. The birth of the new Venom can be seen in The Amazing Spider-Man #654 in February 2011. On January 28, 2011, the identity of \\"black ops\\" Venom was revealed to be Flash Thompson. Flash is hired by the government to be a special agent wearing the Venom symbiote as part of Project Rebirth. Flash is only allowed to wear the suit for up to 48 hours, or risk a permanent bonding with the symbiote. Along with the alien, Flash is equipped with a \\"Multi-Gun\\" designed to change into any type of gun Flash needs. The Government is also equipped with a \\"kill switch\\" designed to take Flash out if he loses control. Flash rejects the kill switch and later joins the Secret Avengers,Secret Avengers Vol. 1 Issues 23-37 Thunderbolts,Thunderbolts Volume 2 issue 1-23 Guardians of the Galaxy,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and even becomes appointed by the Klyntar a Space Knight.Venom: Space Knight Vol. 1 1-13 ===Lee Price=== Lee Price first appeared in Venom Vol. 3 #1 and dying in Spider- Man/Venom Free Comic Book Day #1. After being separated from Flash Thompson through unspecified means, the Venom symbiote happens upon a black market deal between Black Cat's gang and Tombstone's gang. He resorts to bonding with one of the men present, a discharged Army Ranger named Lee Price who was with Scorpion as part of Black Cat's gang. The weakened symbiote pleads with Price, attempting to convince him to become a hero like Thompson. Price ignores and overpowers it, intent on using it for personal gain as a new, wholly villainous Venom. Lee Price makes his way to Black Cat's hideout where Scorpion accuses him of botching the black market sale by causing the shoot- out. After having to keep the Venom symbiote from attacking Black Cat, Lee Price takes his leave from Black Cat's lair as Scorpion gets suspicious towards Lee. His departure is seen by some FBI Agents. Lee Price later gets attacked by Tombstone's minion Firebug. Upon defeating Firebug, an FBI Agent with a bazooka appears telling Lee Price that he is under arrest.Venom Vol. 3 #2 Lee Price eventually loses the symbiote when Eddie Brock and Spider-Man take him down and he is arrested by the NYPD. While incarcerated at the New York Corrections Supermax Facility for Superhuman Incarceration, Lee Price is feared by most of the inmates and he even defeats three inmates in the prison's cafeteria when they try to kill him to boost their reputation. Lee swears to get out, reclaim the Venom symbiote, and plan revenge on those who have wronged him.Venom #155 Lee Price is later visited by his lawyer who tells him that two of the inmates he defeated had died in the infirmary and that Venom has resurfaced upon it being revealed in the news.Venom #157 At the courthouse, Lee Price's lawyer stated that Lee's actions as Venom were caused by the Venom symbiote while the opposing lawyer mentions about Venom still being at large. The judge then asked for some evidence to help with the trial. After the trial, Lee Price is released from prison and begins his plans to reclaim the Venom symbiote and take revenge on those who have wronged him.Venom #158 In Venom Inc., Lee Price steals the Mania symbiote from Andy and becomes Maniac. He uses the symbiote to infect the crime bosses and become a criminal kingpin, but he is defeated by Spider-Man, Venom, Black Cat and Agent Anti-Venom.Venom Inc When Cletus Kasady was collecting the codex left in the bodies of previous hosts, he disguised himself as Eddie and went to jail where he killed Lee after ripping the Maniac symbiote off him, while framing Eddie for the murder.Spider-Man/Venom Free Comic Book Day.

During the Kree- Skrull War, the Kree, desiring to replicate the Skrull's shape-shifting abilities, they obtain the newborn Venom, which had been outcast from the other symbiotes, on Gorr's planet where Knull had created the symbiotes. Tel- Kar is recruited to be bonded to the newborn symbiote in order to infiltrate the Skrull army. Tel-Kar's body is biologically altered so he can have full control over the symbiote's mind to the point of erasing its memories. He successfully infiltrated the Skrull army discovering various secrets. However he blew his cover up in order to save some Kree refugees and handed the symbiote to them to return it to Hala. Then Tel-Kar was betrayed by Ronan the Accuser who used a Kree Sentry to capture Tel-Kar and was given to the Skrulls as a war criminal. Separated from Tel-Kar after his capture, the symbiote goes on to be bonded to Spider-Man.Venom First Host #1. Marvel Comics.Spider-Man Annual #1. Marvel Comics.

Angered by Venom's refusal to return to him, Tel-Kar threatens to bond to Venom's latest offspring and turn it into a monster. Acceding to Tel-Kar, Venom reunites with him and they go to a Skrull research base to get a Skrull bioweapon. Simultaneously, Eddie is bonded to the offspring calling itself Sleeper and allies with M'Lanz to stop Tel-Kar. During the ensuing battle, Tel-Kar concludes that he doesn't need Venom anymore and uses an electrified spear to detach himself from it while scarring himself in the process. Later he is betrayed by the Kree Empire while Eddie escapes with Venom and M'Lanz with Sleeper.

The reformed Agent Venom and his allies proceed to dismantle Mercurio's forces, but Mercurio himself escapes, and swears vengeance on both the symbiote and Thompson.

Marvel Comics ==Powers and abilities== Though it requires a living host in order to survive, the Venom symbiote has been shown to be adept at fending for itself independent of a host. The symbiote is capable of shapeshifting abilities, including the ability to form spikes or expand its size, as well as mimic the appearance of other humanoids after it has obtained a host. The organism can additionally use its shape-shifting abilities to conceal itself by altering its coloration or by becoming completely invisible. It also contains a small \\"dimensional aperture\\", allowing its hosts to carry items without adding mass to the costume. The symbiote also exhibits telepathic abilities, primarily when it needs to communicate with its host. Because of its contact with Spider-Man, the symbiote grants all of its subsequent hosts that hero's powers and cannot be detected by his spider-sense. As Spider-Man's fighting style is partly dependent on his spider-sense, his effectiveness was somewhat hampered when he battled Eddie Brock. Retaining its memory from the time it was bonded with Spider-Man, Venom is also capable of producing webbing similar to Spider-Man's own variety created from itself. The symbiote greatly enhances the physical strength of those it bonds with. Its hosts experience a vastly larger size and musculature. The symbiote displays non-human teeth, which are very sharp, and commonly protrudes a long tongue from its mouth. Venom is depicted as being physically much bigger than Spider-Man, as well as having more brute strength. Venom exhibits some immunities to the supernatural powers of others such as the Penance Stare of Ghost Rider or Spider-Man's extrasensory spider-sense. Some incarnations of the Venom symbiote have shown it able to replicate itself. This ability is shown in the 2005–2006 miniseries Spider-Man: Reign, when Venom recreates his own symbiote to combat his loneliness. The Venom symbiote is vulnerable to fire and sonic waves, causing it great pain and exhaustion if it sustains enough exposure. It can sense and track all of its offspring symbiotes except Carnage, who learned how to block this ability shortly after bonding with Cletus Kasady and confronting Venom/Eddie Brock for the first time. The Venom symbiote is shown to form giant Web-like dragon wings when it was in contact with Knull. ==Other versions== ===Prime Earth (Earth-616)=== Earth-616 is the prime Marvel Comics continuity.

As a child, Kron was continually abused by the android housekeeper which mistook him for a dog, and as a result he later became a bully, taking enjoyment in other people's pain. The relationship between the two brothers is so conflicted that Miguel tried to kill Kron at one point. In his introduction, Stone ordered Jake Gallows' family to be killed. Gallows found Stone and fatally wounded him with a knife as revenge, before dumping his body into the sewer.Punisher 2099 #2 As Kron layed dying in the sewer, his body brushed up against a black ball.

After a fight between Spider-Man and Venom, the former emerged as the victor, using loud speakers to neutralize Venom, who was subsequently taken to the lab for study.

When she was a child, her left arm was badly burned in a crash that also resulted in the death of her mother. Raised by her father, Theo, Alea was bullied at school over her scars. She was then selected to undergo an experimental treatment being developed by Alchemax scientist Dr. Russell. She regained consciousness to find that the treatment had worked and her arm was restored. During a confrontation the next day with a girl at school, a black tendril emerged from her hand and sliced through the Alchemax monitoring bracelet. Alea heard a sinister voice in her head, her left arm transforming into a jet-black limb tipped with razor-sharp claws. Returning home, Alea learned that the purported panacea she'd been treated with was a piece of a symbiote called Venom, and that Alchemax intended to turn her into a supersoldier using it. Empathizing with its pain, felt, Alea reluctantly agreed to the symbiote's request to be made whole in exchange for her getting her normal life back. Infiltrating Alchemax, Alea was accosted by a pair of guards and was horrified when the symbiote killed them to protect her. As the symbiote scolded her innocent naivety, Alea protested that she didn't want to be seen as a monster. Arriving at the lab containing the other pieces of the symbiote, Alea shut down the containment grid, but was knocked unconscious by Dr. Russell. The Venom symbiote, reclaiming its disparate pieces, bonded to Alea, transformed her into Venom and had eaten Dr. Russell as revenge for cutting it apart. Disgusted, Alea reiterated that she didn't want to become a monster and asked if they could be a hero instead; the Venom symbiote begrudgingly agreeing to her request. At school the following day, Alea transformed into Venom to terrify her bully. However, the symbiote was abruptly overcome by the will of a dark god. Alarmed, Alea asked the Venom symbiote what had happened and it told her that the god of its species, Knull, was somehow still alive and on Earth. ==== Other versions ==== * A variant of Venom 2099 appears as a member of the Sinister Six along with another version of the Vulture and Doctor Octopus.Spider-Man 2099 vol. 3 #23. * Timestorm 2009-2099's version of Scorpion is Kron Stone.Timestorm 2009-2099 #1 === Marvel Adventures === In this reality, after Reed Richards removed the symbiote from Spider-Man, Johnny Storm briefly bonded with it, believing it to be a technological suit like Spider-Man originally thought.

At the debut fashion show for the line, Peter Parker is photographing with Mary Jane Watson wearing one of the dresses, unaware of its true nature. In the audience is the Power Pack in their civilian identities, invited by Peter as a thank you for their help in the previous two issues. When the symbiotes hear Peter's name, their genetic memory recognizes it and they turn Mary Jane and the other three models into She-Venoms, and attack. The Power Pack join Spider-Man in the battle, during which Spider-Man briefly corners the designer and gets the truth out of him about the clones. The symbiote clones are sheared from their unwilling hosts, three by a sonic boom produced by Julie Power/Lightspeed's superhuman speed, the other by an energy burst from Katie Power/Energizer. The battle is then won when Jack Power/Mass Master uses the music booth to blast them all with high audio, crippling them long enough to be captured. During the battle, however, one symbiote clone manages to briefly make contact with Katie Power's alien-born costume, causing it to become \\"infected\\" by the Venom symbiote's evil and vengeful desires (the kids' costumes in this continuity are semi- biological themselves, a concept later reinforced during a later mini-series when one is seen to repair damage to itself on its own). This causes Katie's costume to take on a Venom-like appearance, with the only differences being it is obviously smaller and Katie's energy burst symbol takes the place of the spider symbol's main body, the spider legs remaining. The Kymellian costume- turned-symbiote completely takes control of the little girl at night, using her to team with the Sinister Six to capture Spider-Man, and then turn on the other members of Power Pack, Katie's own siblings, to take revenge on them for their part in the symbiote clones' defeat. In the final battle, Julie Power manages to find and free Spider-Man, and together they manage to get Electro to blast all the villains, including himself, with a large electrical discharge powerful enough to render them all unconscious and again shear the costume-turned-symbiote off of Katie, the discharge purging Katie's costume of the \\"infection\\" in the process, restoring it to normal. === Marvel Fairy Tales === In Spider-Man Fairy Tales #3, Venom is a Tsuchigumo who seeks to corrupt the young priest Izumi (the Peter Parker character) by making him give into his anger.Spider-Man Fairy Tales #3.

Marvel Comics. === Spider-Gwen === In this reality, Dr. Elsa Brock created the Venom symbiote from the radioactive spider isotopes developed by S.I.L.K. leader Cindy Moon to cure the Lizard formula as requested by the city's Kingpin, Matt Murdock, to offer Spider-Woman a solution to losing her powers and curing the new Lizard, Harry Osborn. Gwen was forced to inject Harry with one of her spider isotopes, causing the serum inside him to mutate into Venom and attach to Wolverine before bonding to Gwen and forming Gwenom. Though Gwen succumbed to its bloodlust at first, after discovering her father was brutally beaten by the Rhino in prison, she eventually learned to control it. The symbiote in this universe despite being amorphous is actually some spiders working together being a \\"mutant cousin\\" of the alien spider that gave Gwen her powers and is not affected by classic symbiote weaknesses like sonic attacks when without a host, the symbiote is vulnerable to sonic when only bonded to a host. Spider-Gwen eventually took full control of the symbiote and turned it into a replica of her classic costume.Spider-Gwen (vol. 2) During Spider-Geddon, the symbiote protected Spider-Gwen from Verna's touch.Spider- Geddon #2.

Marvel Comics === Spider-Man: India === In the final issue of the mini-series Spider-Man: India (Earth-50101), Venom appears as an exiled interdimensional demon. It is later explained, that Venom was trapped in an ancient amulet now used by tycoon Nalin Oberoi. Pavitr Prabhakar is briefly possessed by the entity, but is rejected, and the amulet sucks in Oberoi, but in the final page, Venom is the only demon left. There's also a mention of Aadi, who is this universe's Eddie Brock. === Spider-Man: Reign === In Kaare Andrews' Spider-Man: Reign, set 30 years from current comics continuity, Venom has been posing as \\"Edward Saks\\", the aide to the Mayor of New York. \\"Edward\\" has been manipulating the city ever since Spider-Man's disappearance in preparation for his eventual return; in the process, he had re-enlisted the Sinister Six, replicated his symbiote thousands of times (chalking it up to being \\"lonely\\"), and built a security system named \\"WEBB\\" which prevents New York citizens from escaping from the city, trapping them while allegedly protecting them from the outside world. Upon meeting him, Venom is quick to berate Spider-Man for abandoning him all those years ago with a genuine sense of bitterness and sorrow, describing himself as a responsibility that Spider-Man neglected, leaving the wallcrawler at a loss for words. Defeated, the Sinister Six, Spidey and Venom have their final battle, in which Sandman gives Spider-Man a detonator to make all the Sinners explode. Spidey presses the button, most likely killing Venom and putting an end to his \\"Reign\\" once and for all.Spider-Man: Reign #1-4 === Spider-Man: Life Story === In a continuity where characters naturally aged after Peter Parker became Spider-Man in 1962, Peter still acquired the Venom symbiote during the Secret Wars in the 1980s. Unlike the main continuity, Peter discovered that the black suit was a symbiote before Reed Richards did, but initially decided against getting rid of it due to his aging body. When Kraven tried burying Peter alive, the symbiote helped him escape the grave and nearly caused him to kill Kraven before Mary Jane helped separate it from him. The traumatic incident led Mary Jane to leave Peter, who abandoned the symbiote. It then bonded with Kraven before the hunter could commit suicide.Spider-Man: Life Story #3. In 2019, the Venom-possessed Kraven attacks Peter and Miles Morales in Doctor Doom's space station as the two heroes attempt to shut down Doom's technology across the planet. When he attempts to let the symbiote possess Miles, he discovers that Otto Octavius is possessing Miles' body, allowing Peter the chance to attack him with a sonic blast from his suit. When the symbiote separates from him, he is nothing more than a skeleton. As Peter stays behind on the space station to ensure the Doomsday Pulse activates, the symbiote helps him one last time by filling in the giant hole of the collapsing station. Once the pulse activates, the station explodes and kills Peter and the symbiote.Spider-Man: Life Story #6: All My Enemies, Chip Zdarsky, Marvel Comics === Spider-Verse === Several versions of Venom are featured in Spider-Verse: *In Spider-Punk's universe, the Variable Engagement Neuro-sensitive Organic Mesh (aka V.E.N.O.M.) is a suit of armor created by Oscorp and worn by the Thunderbolt Department, the police and fire department of President Osborn.

Marvel Comics. === Ultimate Marvel === ==== Publication history ==== Venom (Ultimate Marvel version). The Ultimate iteration of Venom was created by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Mark Bagley and was introduced in Ultimate Spider-Man #33, while the Conrad Markus version was introduced in Ultimate Spider-Man Volume 2 #16.1. His appearance was designed by Mark Bagley to be more of a monster than a supervillain, describing him as a \\"huge cancerous/tumorous creature\\". ==== Fictional character biography ==== The Ultimate Marvel version of Eddie Brock was a writer for the Daily Globe. He was at Justin Hammer's press conference; his face is not shown, only his hands and arms appear.Bendis, Brian Michael (w), Bagley, Mark (p), Ultimate Spider-Man #17. Marvel Comics. The Ultimate incarnation of Venom is vastly different from the E incarnation: Eddie Brock Jr. is Peter Parker's childhood friend (along with a college student who is a lab assistant for Curtis Connors) and the Venom symbiote is not extraterrestrial but is the second stage of a genetically created \\"suit\\" designed by Richard Parker (Peter's father) and Eddie Brock Sr. (Eddie's father) as a cure for severe disease meant to bond to the user and protect them from internal and external harm. The suit is tailored for a specific DNA (Richard's in this case), and the person to whom it belongs can control the suit more easily. If, however, someone uses a suit designed for somebody else, they are constantly damaged by the suit which requires nourishment, gained by feeding on organic flesh, to function. If bonded to an incompatible host the Venom suit begins consuming them almost immediately, forcing them to feed on others to sustain it or die themselves. When taking a host, the organic matter that comprises the suit completely envelops the host, regardless of resistance, temporarily blinding it, before encasing itself in a hard, purple casing, similar to a pupa, as it bonds further with the host. When the host emerges, the suit then shifts its appearance and function to assist its host, such as creating eyes for it to see through, or tries to take it over, inducing a homicidal rage and attempting to feed itself if bonded with an incompatible host. When bonded with a host and forcibly removed, the Venom suit leaves trace amounts of itself in their bloodstream, which attracts other samples of Venom to itself, and can overload Peter's spider-sense. In the video game Ultimate Spider-Man, absorbing the trace amounts in Peter's blood allowed Eddie to take complete control of the suit, gaining a greater ability to talk and a spider symbol on his chest. Venom's only known weakness is electricity, and larger amounts of the suit will need more electricity to kill, as varying amounts of the suit will be stunned or vaporized by electric shocks. This was first seen in Ultimate Spider-Man #38, when an electric wire got tangled around Venom's foot. An electrocution from live power-lines vaporised the smaller amount on Peter, while a similar amount disabled Eddie. Note in the video game Ultimate Spider-Man, when Electro electrocutes Venom during a cutscene, the suit is not affected by the shock like the live power- line did in the \\"Venom\\" arc. The suit can take the Shocker's vibro-shocks, and can protect its host from a bullet, who feels nothing more than a relaxing vibration.Bendis, Brian Michael. Ultimate Spider-Man #34. Marvel Comics. The Venom suit was introduced when Peter Parker reunited with his childhood friend Eddie Brock Jr. to continue their fathers' research into a protoplasmic cure for cancer. Eddie Sr. had kept the suit in the lab for his son as his legacy. After finding that Bolivar Trask had tried to weaponize his father's research, Peter attempted to steal a sample to conduct his own research on, but spilled it by accident.Bendis, Brian Michael. Ultimate Spider-Man #33. Marvel Comics. The original Spider-Man (Peter Parker) was able to control the suit to a greater extent than anyone because of his powers and because the suit was designed for his father. Feeding off Spider-Man's own thoughts, the suit enhanced his strength, generated its own webbing, and made him completely bulletproof. But when Spider-Man was chasing down an armed robber, the suit attempted to take over him, growing a fanged maw. After fighting for control, Spider-Man electrocuted the suit before returning to destroy the sample. Enraged, Eddie ignored Peter's warnings and used a second sample of the Venom suit on himself. Eddie, wearing the Venom suit, initially resembled a bulkier version of Spider-Man but the suit grew a fanged mouth, claws, tentacles and spinal ridges. Eddie hunted down Peter, intending to force him to be absorbed in the suit but was electrocuted by downed power lines and retreated.Bendis, Brian Michael. Ultimate Spider-Man #33-39. Marvel Comics. Eddie was then captured by Silver Sable, who was hired by Bolivar since the suit technically belonged to him and ordered Adrian Toomes to conduct his experiments on the suit in an attempt to remove the suit from Eddie. Then Beetle tried to capture Venom, but Venom escaped and was confronted by Spider-Man. During a battle the suit eventually separated itself from Eddie and forcibly bonded itself with Peter, turning him into Venom. The Ultimates arrived and were able to separate Peter from the suit. Eddie later approached Peter and demanded that he retrieve the suit for him but was rebuffed. During a confrontation between Peter, Eddie and Gwen Stacy, Gwen transformed into Carnage. Contact with Carnage caused trace amounts of the suit within Eddie's body to multiply, transforming him into Venom, at which point the two symbiotes began to fight. After a brief battle the Venom symbiote absorbed all traces of the Carnage symbiote, leaving Gwen an ordinary human, and causing Venom to change into a new form even larger than before, with small glowing red eyes. Venom retreated from battle, and was later captured by the Beetle and taken to Latveria.Bendis, Brian Michael. Ultimate Spider-Man #123-128. Marvel Comics. Venom appeared with his trademark white spider symbol in Ultimates 3.Loeb, Jeph (w), Madureira, Joe (a), Ultimates 3 #1. Marvel Comics. He attacks the Ultimates' mansion, demanding to find the woman. The Ultimates fight him until Thor strikes him with lightning, turning him into a puddle of organic matter. He is revealed to be an android created by Ultron as a pawn in a master plan.Loeb, Jeph (w), Madureira, Joe (a), Ultimates 3 #4. Marvel Comics. Conrad Marcus was an employee at Oscorp that helped create the spider behind Miles Morales's powers.Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man #1 An employee of the Roxxon Corporation, Marcus willingly becomes the Venom symbiote's new host and was a more larger Venom than the Eddie Brock's version. When investigative reporter Betty Brant incorrectly assumes that the new Spider-Man (Miles Morales) is Jefferson Davis, Venom kills Betty.Bendis, Brian Michael (w), Marquez, David (a). Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man #16.1. December 2012. Marvel Comics. Afterwards, Venom destroys Oscorp's abandoned building and later appears at Miles's apartment due to his believing Jefferson to be the new Spider-Man. During the ensuing battle between Venom and Spider-Man, Jefferson is injured and taken to a hospital. Venom appears there, leading to another battle with Spider-Man and the police that accidentally kills both Rio Morales and Marcus.Bendis, Brian Michael (w), Pichelli, Sara (a).

The suit takes control of Spider-Man and as it constantly feeds on him, Spider-Man ages at an accelerated rate. Within days, Spider-Man dies of old age. Desperate to survive, the symbiote bonds with a weakened Hulk. Thor confronts Venom-Hulk. The costume explains that it is sorry for Spider-Man's death, but is draining the gamma radiation from Bruce Banner as repentance. Thor in disbelief defeats him, leading the symbiote to take over Thor. Banner however is shown cured of being The Hulk. The heroes employ Black Bolt's incredibly powerful voice to create enough sonic damage to critically injure the symbiote. Thor is freed, and the heroes prepare to transport the alien to another dimension. Black Cat takes matters into her own hands and kills the alien because of anger at the death of Spider-Man. ==== ...Venom had possessed The Punisher? ==== In this one-shot issue, after the symbiote leaves Spider- Man, it joins with the Punisher instead of Eddie Brock. Castle uses the symbiote's abilities to further his war on crime; he used the suit's shape- shifting nature to create glider-wings and used its webbing as bullets. The symbiote causes the Punisher's war to become more brutal and unrestrained than ever before as he set about confronting and killing many super-criminals. The symbiote eventually influences him to confront and beat Spider-Man, but before it can kill the Web Slinger, Castle's soldierly discipline wins out. With his new powers, Punisher takes out Tombstone and even the Kingpin. At the climax of a confrontation with Spider-Man, Daredevil and Moon Knight, from which the Punisher emerges victorious, a blast from Spider-Man's borrowed sonic blaster allows Punisher to overcome and tame the symbiote by convincing it that his war on crime means more to him than anything, even his own life, and would sooner commit suicide and kill them both if he did not have complete control over it. The symbiote then recedes from Punisher's face and manifests his trademark Skull insignia upon his chest. Castle tells the assembled heroes that he is in control now before making his escape. ==== ...The Marvel Super- Heroes had remained on Battleworld? ==== In this one-shot issue, the Marvel Super-Heroes and Villains left alive from the Secret Wars after Galactus' and the Beyonder's fatal battle find themselves trapped on Battleworld. Deciding to make the best of things, they all settle down and build new lives and families. Twenty-five years later, Spider-Man and the Venom symbiote are a single entity. With Reed Richards dead, there was no way to free Spider-Man from the symbiote and thus he was forced to accept this new way of life. Over time he becomes cold, calculating and emotionally distant from the rest of the group. The body of Peter Parker is now nothing more than a skeleton with the symbiote acting as his skin, much to the dismay of the other super-heroes and their children.What If... Vol. 2, #114 ==== ...Spider-Man had rejected the Spider? ==== This one-shot issue presents a different approach to the events of Spider-Man: The Other, where Peter Parker dies and is resurrected with greater spider powers. Instead, Peter rejects the chance to rise again in a new form and leaves his body and spirit separated. This leaves his body open to a complete takeover by the Venom symbiote. The suit quickly abandons its latest host, Mac Gargan, as soon as it senses Peter's vulnerable state and rushes to once again unite with its first host. After cocooning Peter's body, the symbiote fully bonds with Peter, turning him into a violent monster called Poison. Poison longs for a companion to join them in their new life and chooses Mary Jane. After dispatching the Avengers who rush to her aid, Watson offers herself willingly to prevent any further harm to the people protecting her. She promises Poison that she will give her body but not her soul and make Poison's life as miserable as possible. This seems to leave Poison heartbroken and he flees. Instead, he unearths the grave of Gwen Stacy. The last images reveal Poison watching over a new cocoon like his own, but crimson colored, as it bursts forth showing a hand similar to Carnage's. ==== ...Iron Man: Demon in an Armor ==== In this one shot, which happens to take place in Earth-90211, Spider-Man has the Venom symbiote costume. Wade Wilson, as Deadpool, is hired by Galactus to kill the Beyonder for merging MODOK to Galactus's rear end in exchange for the Community Cube. He was given a weapon called the Recton Expungifier, the only weapon that could kill the Beyonder. When Deadpool tracked down his target to a night club, he was enticed into the Beyonder's partying lifestyle, getting Jheri curls in the process. While hanging out with the Beyonder in a flying limousine, Spider-Man broke into the car and demanded the symbiote costume be removed from himself. Beyonder's driver shoots Spider- Man out of the limousine and the symbiote leaves Spider-Man and merges with Deadpool, creating Venompool. However, after years of partying, Beyonder grew tired and threw Venompool to the world, snapping him out of the Beyonder's magic. Venompool attempted to resume his contract and kill the Beyonder, but he accidentally pawned the Recton Expungifier. He decides to get himself clean by kidnapping and selling a drunken Tony Stark to A.I.M. Unfortunately, he can't join any major superhero teams, like the Avengers, Defenders and Fantastic Four because of his newly acquired Jheri curls. ===What The--?!=== In the Spider-Ham universe, \\"The Bee-Yonder\\" gives Spider-Ham a version of the black uniform.Spider-Ham #17. In issue #20, Pork Grind, a pig version of Venom is introduced as an enemy of Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham. He was a Wild Boar from Australia, who accepted a deal with a supervillain to become Pork Grind, because every Superhero needs to have an evil counterpart. He was much stronger than Spider-Ham, who was smashed by him like paper.

In the viral marketing campaign for The Amazing Spider-Man 2 a Daily Bugle article by Eddie Brock detailing Cletus Kasady's capture was featured, with Anne Weying being mentioned in another article. In March 2012, Josh Trank was in talks to direct a new Venom film as a part of The Amazing Spider-Man film series. In December 2013, Sony officially announced two spin-offs of The Amazing Spider-Man film series, one of which was a Venom film called Venom: Carnage, written by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Ed Solomon, with Kurtzman directing it. In September 2014, Kurtzman stated that they had been considering different incarnations of the character, including Eddie Brock, Anne Weying, and Flash Thompson. The movie, along with the other spin-offs, was cancelled prior to the studios' contract agreement with Marvel Studios. ====Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters==== In March 2016, following the introduction of Spider-Man to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it was announced that Sony was moving forward with a standalone film after hiring Dante Harper to write the script, and Arad, Matt Tolmach and Amy Pascal producing. The film was initially reported to have no connection to the MCU nor have any relation to Spider-Man; it would be set in its own continuity. A year later, Sony announced that Venom would be released on October 5, 2018 with Scott Rosenberg and Jeff Pinkner signed on as screenwriters. It was reported to be Rated R and be the first in a series of Spider-Man character-related spin-off films called \\"Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters\\".

The symbiote suit also appears as an alternate costume for Spider-Man in several games. ==== Spider-Man games ==== * The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom first appears as a boss character in the Mega-CD/Sega CD version of The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin. * The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom is both a protagonist and playable character in Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage and Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety. * The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom appears as a boss in The Amazing Spider-Man: Lethal Foes. * The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom appears as the final boss in the 1995 Spider-Man game based on the 1990s animated series. * The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom appears as a boss and later a supporting character in the 2000 Spider- Man video game, voiced by Daran Norris. This version of Venom is dark blue rather than black and also has the ability to turn invisible. After learning Spider-Man attacked Otto Octavius' science exposition, Venom kidnaps the hero's wife Mary Jane Watson and luring Spider-Man into the sewers to exact revenge. After defeating Venom, Spider-Man reveals he was framed, and they join forces to figure out who did it. Venom later helps Spider-Man fight Carnage, though he is defeated, and rescues him alongside Captain America and Black Cat from Doctor Octopus' self-destructing base at the end of the game. * The Ultimate Marvel iteration of Venom appears as a playable character and the final boss in the Ultimate Spider-Man video game, with Eddie Brock voiced by Daniel Capallaro and Venom voiced by Arthur Burghardt. The symbiote suit is also available as an alternate costume for Spider-Man and appears briefly in the game's opening scene. In a separate storyline that crosses over with Spider-Man's, Venom is hunted by Bolivar Trask, who wants the symbiote for experimentation. After being captured by Silver Sable following a battle with Spider-Man, Eddie is forced to test the symbiote for Trask by fighting Electro and track down Peter, whose DNA will supposedly improve Eddie's control over the symbiote, but Venom escapes. He later defeats the Beetle and interferes in a fight between Peter and Sable, which leads to him being defeated and captured by Trask again. After escaping and defeating Peter after he was bonded to the Carnage symbiote, Venom absorbs it off Peter, gaining complete control over his own symbiote in the process. Though Spider-Man stops him from killing Trask, Venom escapes from prison and does so anyway. * The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom (voiced by Topher Grace) appears in the Spider-Man 3 video game. Similarly to the film, Spider-Man removes the symbiote after it becomes a negative influence on his behavior, only for it to then bond with Eddie, who seeks revenge against both Spider-Man and Peter Parker. Adopting the Venom alias, he blackmails the Sandman into helping him kill Spider-Man, but meets his demise during the final battle. * The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom appears as a playable character in Spider-Man: Friend or Foe, voiced by Quinton Flynn. In the opening cutscene, he is seen fighting Spider-Man alongside other villains until they are all attacked by P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s created by Mysterio using shards of the meteor that brought the Venom symbiote to Earth. Venom is captured along with the other villains, placed under mind control, and sent to Transylvania to retrieve a meteor shard located there. After Spider-Man defeats Venom using sonic vibrations and destroys the mind- control device, he joins forces with the web-slinger to exact revenge on Mysterio; becoming a playable character. * The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom serves as the main antagonist and the final boss of Spider-Man: Web of Shadows, voiced by Keith Szarabajka. During this game, part of his symbiote splits off from him and bonds with Spider-Man, giving him access to the black suit again. Venom attacks Manhattan with an army of symbiotes, forcing Spider- Man to join forces with S.H.I.E.L.D., the Kingpin, and many others to defeat him. Following several encounters, Spider-Man confronts Venom at S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Helicarrier after he takes on a giant, five-headed form. Despite destroying four of the heads, Spider-Man fails to kill Venom, so he appeals to Eddie's better nature. After Eddie emerges from Venom, Spider-Man can either kill Venom himself or allow Eddie to sacrifice himself to do so. No matter which choice is made, Venom dies, allowing Spider-Man to stop the invasion or take control of the symbiotes himself. ** In the PS2 and PSP versions of the game, the Tinkerer captures Venom after he attacks Manhattan with his symbiote army and the final boss is a large symbiote with seven heads that contains Venom's consciousness. ** In the Nintendo DS version, Venom is not the cause of the invasion. Instead, he is trying to stop it as well, and becomes an ally of Spider-Man after he defeats him. * In Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, Ultimate Spider-Man (voiced by Josh Keaton) is provided a copy of the Venom symbiote suit that Madame Web telepathically controls to prevent it from consuming him. * Two versions of the black suit appear as alternate costumes for Spider-Man in The Amazing Spider-Man game. One is based on its appearance in Spider-Man 3 and the other is a modified version of Spider-Man's costume from the film the game is based on. Backstory for the game also reveals that the game's version of Scorpion was created using a \\"black goo\\" recovered from space. * The Venom symbiote is referenced in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 video game. Oscorp runs a secret experiment at Ravencroft called the \\"Venom Project\\", using nanites as regenerating body armor that grant enhanced strength. This project is what gives Cletus Kasady the Carnage symbiote near the end of the game. The symbiote suit is also available as an alternate costume for Spider-Man via DLC. ** The Eddie Brock version of Venom appears in the mobile version of the game, voiced by Benjamin Diskin. Originally a photographer who tricks Spider-Man into fighting crooks and allowing him to take pictures of him in action, Eddie later investigates Oscorp but gets caught, forcing Spider-Man to save him. However, upon investigating a second time, Eddie discovers their illegal activities and is transformed into Venom, who goes on a rampage through the city until Spider- Man defeats him and removes the symbiote from him. Eddie explains what happened before passing out and Spider-Man takes him to the hospital. * Numerous versions of Venom appear as playable characters in Spider-Man Unlimited.

Lindley began his career with his hometown club Keighley Town before joining Merseyside outfit Everton before going into coaching and management with Swindon Town and Crewe Alexandra. ==Career== Though he didn't make a League breakthrough until 1947/48, Lindley had joined Everton from his home-town club Keighley in February 1936. He did make wartime appearances at Goodison, however, as well as guest outings for Bradford City, Leeds, Walsall, Bournemouth and Leicester City (at left-half in January 1945).Of Fossils and Foxes, 2001, p484, Lindley played for Everton as a wing half, making 51 Football League appearances between 1947 and 1951.Post War English & Scottish Football League A - Z Player's Transfer Database profile He joined Swindon Town as a coach in 1951, stepping up to the manager's seat two years later, when Louis Page was sacked. His time in charge was not a happy one - with the club in financial difficulty, houses were sold to raise cash for players, but Lindley was given just £3,000 to spend. He spent most of this on one player - Matt Gemmell, costing £2,250 from Portsmouth, and he made just eight league appearances for the club.Post War English & Scottish Football League A - Z Player's Transfer Database profile Swindon finished in their lowest league position in Lindley's first season - 20th - and when the 1954-55 season looked to be going the same way, he was given three months' notice in January 1955. By the time Lindley left the club in April, the Town were well on the way to beating the record set the previous year - with a terrible away record which saw just one win and fifteen defeats, they finished in a lowly 21st position. A month later, Lindley was appointed as the manager of Crewe Alexandra. His spell at the Railwaymen proved to be even less successful than his time at Swindon, as they finished bottom of the Third Division North three times in three successively worse seasons. Lindley was sacked after the third bottom-place finish, which meant that the club would be competing in the new Fourth Division the following year. Later Lindley teamed up with Don Revie at Leeds United and became his valued assistant manager and chief scout. Lindley stayed at the club for over twenty years and became caretaker manager on four separate occasions.

He is less straightforward than most characters in the novel, and a number of interpretations have been put forward to which social class he represents as regards to the Russian Revolution and the Soviet Union. (Animal Farm is an allegory for the evolution of Communism in Russia, with each animal representing a different social class, e.g. Boxer represents the working class.) Benjamin also represents the old people of Russia because he remembers the old laws that have been changed. == Interpretations == Some interpret Benjamin as representing the aged population of Russia, because he is old and cynical. Others feel that he represents the Menshevik intelligentsia as he is just as intelligent, if not more so, than the novel's pigs, yet he is marginalized. He is very cynical about the Revolution and life in general. It has also been argued that he represents the skeptical people who believed that Communism would not help the people of Russia, but who did not criticize it fervently enough to lose their lives. His Biblical name could also imply that he represents the Jewish populace of Russia whose lives were not remotely improved under Joseph Stalin's leadership. He is one of the wisest animals on the farm and is able to \\"read as well as any pig\\". However, he rarely uses his ability, because he feels there is nothing worth reading. He does not use his ability for the benefit of others until the end of the book, when Boxer is sent off to the slaughterhouse, and when Clover asks him to read the public display of the Seven Commandments, as they, for the last time in the book, changed; Benjamin reveals that the Commandments now consist entirely of the message \\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\\". Despite his age, he is never given the option of retirement (none of the animals are). Only the pigs' betrayal of his best friend, Boxer, spurs him into (failed) action, after which Benjamin becomes even more cynical than ever. He is also quite significant in that he is not quite a horse (the working class) and yet definitely not a leader like the pigs, although his intellect is at least equal to theirs, this implies that Benjamin is a symbol of the intelligentsia who during the revolution and its aftermath are very much aware of what is going on, but do nothing about it. Although he is aware of their mistreatment (especially that of Boxer) and can see how the basic rules of their society are changing, he is unwilling to act on it in any way that would threaten his security. Orwell became known as \\"Donkey George\\" to his friends – a reference to both his gloomy disposition and the character of Benjamin. == Film == In the 1954 film, Benjamin is voiced by Maurice Denham and is the main protagonist. In the film, it is Benjamin who leads the other animals in a counter-revolution against Napoleon when his abuses finally go too far. In the 1999 film, he is voiced by Pete Postlethwaite (who also played Farmer Jones in the film). In the film, Benjamin simply flees Napoleon's unendurable regime with some of the other animals and returns after the regime had collapsed (neither event occurs in the book). ==References== Category:Animal Farm characters Category:Fictional donkeys Category:Literary characters introduced in 1945 Category:Fictional revolutionaries Category:Male characters in literature ","title":"Benjamin (Animal Farm)"},{"id":"7820916","text":"Tenacious D: The Greatest Band on Earth, or sometimes called The Adventures of Tenacious D, is a TV series that ran on HBO in 1997, 1999 and 2000.

Ravenna was then the capital of the Byzantine Empire's territories in Italy, and Maximianus's role may have included secular political functions. ==Life== Born in the Istrian town of Vistar (now Veštar) near Pola (Pula) in modern-day Croatia, Maximianus was consecrated bishop of Ravenna in 546 by Pope Vigilius in Patras, Greece. Maximianus was a forty-eight-year-old deacon from Pola when he became the twenty-sixth bishop of Ravenna. According to the ninth-century Ravennate priest Andreas Agnellus, Maximianus' flock initially refused his leadership, because he was selected by the emperor Justinian I and was not their initial candidate. To a modern art historian Meyer Shapiro, \\"Maximian was \\"a poor deacon of Pola who rose to a high position through his political adroitness\\" as a protegé of Justinian I. He had not been wanted as archbishop by the people of Ravenna, but \\"by shrewd maneuvres he overcame their opposition, and won their respect by his discretion, generosity, and great enterprises of church building and decoration\\".Schapiro, 38 He completed the Basilica of San Vitale and Sant'Apollinare in Classe in Ravenna, and built several other churches, including Santa Maria del Canneto in his native Istria. Maximianus devoted himself to the revision of liturgical books and to the emendation of the Latin text of the Bible, and commissioned a large number of illuminated manuscripts. For the high altar in Ravenna he had a hanging made of the most costly cloth, which was embroidered with a portrayal of the entire life of Jesus. In another hanging he had portraits of all his predecessors embroidered on gold ground. Maximian's most remarkable episcopal furnishing is the Throne of Maximian, the cathedra of the bishop which was constructed entirely of ivory panels. It was probably carved in Constantinople and shipped to Ravenna. It consists of decorative floral panels framing various figured panels, including one with the complex monogram of the bishop. In a famous 6th-century mosaic in San Vitale, Maximianus (named above the figure) is with Emperor Justinian and his retinue. The saint holds a jewelled cross and wears early versions of an alb, chasuble and pallium. He is regarded as a saint by both the Catholic and Orthodox churches, though essentially local to Ravenna, where there is a church dedicated to him at Piazza S. Massimiano, Punta Marina, Ravenna, 48020. ==Gallery== File:Sanvitale03.jpgEmperor Justinian and his retinue, Maximian on his right.

It was ranked by King Malcolm as the third great Officer of State, called Camerarius Domini Regis, and had a salary of £200 per annum allotted to him. He anciently collected the revenues of the Crown, at least before Scotland had a Treasurer, of which office there is no vestige of until the restoration of King James I when he disbursed the money necessary for the maintenance of the King's Household. The Great Chamberlain had jurisdiction for judging of all crimes committed within burgh, and of the crime of forestalling; and was in effect Justice-General over the burghs, and held Chamberlain-ayrs every year for that purpose; the form whereof is set down in Iter Camerarii, the Chamberlain-ayr. He was a supreme judge and his Decrees could not be questioned by any inferior judicatory. His sentences were to be put into execution by the baillies of burghs. He also settled the prices of provisions within burghs, and the fees of the workmen in the Mint. The Chamberlain lost his financial functions after 1425 to the Treasurer. The position was vacant from 1558 to 1565 and again from 1569. It was occupied in 1580 for the cousin of James I, Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox, whose appearance as a Great Officer of State in 1581 is attributable to his personal standing with the king rather than his office. But following the Raid of Ruthven, 24 August 1582, the Great Chamberlain lost his supervision of the royal burghs. Thereafter the office was held by successive Dukes of Lennox (heritably from 1603) until resigned to the Crown ad perpetuam remanentiam by the Duke of Richmond and Lennox in 1703, since which time no Great Chamberlain has been appointed. In 1711 a form of the office was revived in a Commission of Chamberlainry and Trade, which lapsed on the death of Queen Anne. ==Lord Chamberlains== ;David I of Scotland () * Edmund, witnessed a charter granting Annandale to Robert de Brus in 1124. * 1130-1153: Herbert ;Malcolm IV of Scotland () * 1153-1160: Herbert * 1160-1165: Nicolaus, later Lord Chancellor ;William the Lion () * 1165-1189: Walter de Berkeley of Redcastle * 1205-14: Philip de Valognes ;Alexander II of Scotland () * 1214-19: William de Valognes * Hugo de Giffard, Lord of Yester and Morham * John de Melville * 1216: Henry de Balliol (d. 1246) * 1228: David de Bernham (later Bishop of St Andrews) * 1231-41: Sir John de Maccuswel (or Maxwell) ;Alexander III of Scotland () * c.1250/1: Sir Robert de Meyners * 1252-1255: William, Earl of Mar * 1255-1257: David de Lindsay of Barnweill and Byres * 1257-60: Aylmer de Maxwell lord of Caerlaverock, Sheriff of Dumfries, son of Sir John Maxwell. * 1260: William, Earl of Mar, again * 1267: Sir Reginald Cheyne * 1269: Sir Thomas Randolph, father of Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray, * 1278: John de Lindsay ;Guardians of the Kingdom of Scotland (First Interregnum)(1286-1292) * 1287-1292: Alexander de Baliol ;John Balliol () * 1292-1296: Alexander de Baliol ;Guardians of the Kingdom of Scotland (Second Interregnum) (1296-1306) *1297-1307: John Sandale ;Robert the Bruce () * 1307: Eustace de Cotesbache * 1319: William de Lindsay * 1325: Alexander Fraser of Touchfraser and Cowie (who married Mary, the King's sister) ;David II of Scotland () * 1329: John Baptista * 1327-1329: Robert de Peebles * 1329-1333: Reginald de Mure * 1333: Sir Robert de Lawedre of The Bass (d. 1337) (also Justiciar) * 1334: William Bullock, under Edward Balliol * 1334-1340: Reginald de Mure * 1341-1342: William Bullock, again * 1343-1346: John de Roxburgh * c.1350-1357: Sir Robert de Erskine * 1357-1358: Thomas Stewart, 2nd Earl of Angus * 1358-1359: Thomas, Earl of Mar * 1359-1363: Walter Fleming of Biggar * c1363-1364: Sir Robert de Erskine, again * 1364-1371: Walter of Biggar, again ;Robert II of Scotland () * 1371-1376: Walter of Biggar, again * 1376: Michael de Monymusk, Bishop of Dunkeld * 1377-1382: Sir John Lyon * 1382: Robert Stewart, Earl of Fife ;Robert III of Scotland () ;James I of Scotland () * 1424-1448: Sir John Forrester of Corstorphine, Knt.The Scottish Nation, Edinburgh, 1867, vol.v, p.250, appointment after August 1424.The Exchequer Rolls of Scotland edited by George Burnett, Lord Lyon King of Arms, vol.v, 1437-1454, Edinburgh, 1882, pps:108, 258, and 297 - the last mention as Chancellor. ;James II of Scotland () * 1448: James Livingstone, 1st Lord LivingstonThe Exchequer Rolls of Scotland edited by George Burnett, Lord Lyon King of Arms, vol.v, 1437-1454, Edinburgh, 1882, p.312, first mention in this capacity and the year of death of Forrester, his predecessor. ;James III of Scotland () * 1467: Robert Boyd, 1st Lord Boyd * 1477: James Stewart, 1st Earl of Buchan * 1483: David Lindsay, 5th Earl of Crawford ;James IV of Scotland () * 1488: Alexander Home, 2nd Lord Home * 1509: Alexander Home, 3rd Lord Home ;James V of Scotland () * 1516: Malcolm Fleming, 3rd Lord Fleming (d. 1547 at Battle of Pinkie) ;Mary, Queen of Scots () * 1547: James Fleming, 4th Lord Fleming (d. 1558) ;James VI of Scotland () * 1565: John Fleming, 5th Lord Fleming (d. 1572)Cracrofts Peerage * 1581: Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox * 1594: Ludovick (or Louis) Stewart, Duke of Lennox (made heritable Chamberlains). ==References== * The Staggering State of the Scots' Statesmen, by Sir John Scot of Scotstarvet, Director of Chancery, Edinburgh, 1754, pps: xx - xxii, and 186-188. * The Exchequer Rolls of Scotland, edited by George Burnett, Lord Lyon King of Arms, vol.II, 1359–1379, Edinburgh, 1878, in the appendix to the Preface is a list of Chamberlains of Scotland.

He moved to Torquay United in October 1936 and made his debut, at right-back, in a 1–0 win at home to Aldershot on 7 November 1936. He was not a regular for his first two seasons with Torquay, but was an ever-present in the 1938–39 season before his career was interrupted by War. When league football resumed in August 1946, Head was again a first choice in the Torquay team, although by now had moved to the centre of defence. He went on to make over 200 league appearances for Torquay before joining Bury in February 1952. He played eleven times for Bury that season, with a further eleven league appearances the following season before retiring to the Bury coaching staff. ==Coaching and managerial career== After beginning his coaching career at Gigg Lane, Head progressed to Chief Scout and then Assistant Manager with the club before taking over as manager of Swindon Town in October 1956. It was an unenviable job. Swindon finished the season just one place off the bottom in the 1956–57 season, and having to apply for re-election. With the league being restructured at the end of the 1957/58 season, it would be crucial for the Town to finish in the top half of the table – to avoid having to become founder members of the newly created Fourth Division. Against all the odds, Swindon finished just three points behind the leaders, Brighton & Hove Albion in fourth place, and took their place in Division Three. In contrast, Head's former side, Torquay, had finished runners-up to Ipswich Town on goal average the previous season, but finished fourth from bottom in 1957–58 and found themselves in the new Division Four. With little money available for transfers, Head set up a youth system, which aimed to develop young players in some of the local leagues. Gradually, these players were blooded in the first team. Shortly before the 1960/61 season, Head arranged a trial match between the \\"Probables\\" and the \\"Possibles\\" – the Probables were the older, experienced players, the Possibles were a team of youngsters. When the Possibles won the game convincingly, it persuaded Head to start the season with a young team, which included the youngest ever full-back pairing of John Trollope and Terry Wollen – both of whom were aged just seventeen. This system produced many future Swindon greats – Trollope, Mike Summerbee, Bobby Woodruff, Ernie Hunt, Keith Morgan, Roger Smart, Rod Thomas, David 'Bronco' Layne and Don Rogers to name but a few – and, as they gradually climbed the league table, the team earned the nickname, \\"Bert's Babes\\". After finishing 9th in 1961/62, Head guided Swindon to their first ever promotion the following season. Swindon's first season in Division Two started brilliantly. The young side won their first six games, leaving them three points clear at the top of the table – and didn't lose until the tenth game, when they were brought crashing back down to earth with a 4–0 defeat at Northampton Town. Suddenly, their form deserted them and in November 1963, they went five games without scoring a goal. They finished the season in a respectable mid-table position. The 1964–65 season started as it meant to go on. An early injury to goalkeeper Norman Oakley sent Town crashing to a 6–1 defeat. As the season went on, more players succumbed to injury – and crucially, the highly rated forward Ernie Hunt was missed most often – firstly with appendicitis, then with a broken foot. Gradually, Town were sucked into a relegation battle, and, when the final day of the season came, Swindon and Portsmouth were level on points, with the Town having superior goal average. Both teams were away – Swindon at Southampton, Portsmouth at Northampton. Amazingly, the League allowed the Pompey game to kick off later in the evening, and when Town lost 2–1 at The Dell, Portsmouth knew they needed only a draw to keep them up. With Northampton already promoted, Pompey got their draw, and condemned Town back to Division Three. They had been unlucky – but the Town board showed no mercy, rather harshly sacking Head in August 1965 – the man who had previously turned the fortunes of the club. Head returned to Bury as manager the same month, where he was forced to sell Colin Bell to Manchester City, a move that infuriated many Bury fans. He left Bury in April 1966 to manage Crystal Palace, having been identified by Palace chairman Arthur Wait as the right man for the job. Although he had limited financial resources at his disposal he guided Palace into the top flight in 1969 for the first time in their history, and kept them up for the following three seasons. In March 1973 he was moved upstairs to a general manager's post until the end of the season, replaced by the flamboyant Malcolm Allison who took Palace back to Division Three over the course of the next two seasons. Head left Palace in May 1973 and also managed Bath City for a spell in the same year. He became a director of Bath City in 1975, resigning from the board in 1982. He also worked as a scout for Swindon Town. Head died in February 2002 in Reading, Berkshire, aged 85. His wife Ginny had died eight years previously, but he left two sons, David, who played professionally for Reading, and Roger and a daughter, Sue. ==References== ==External links== *Manager profile at Swindon Town FC * Category:1916 births Category:2002 deaths Category:People from Midsomer Norton Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Welton Rovers F.C. players Category:Torquay United F.C. players Category:Bury F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Watford F.C. wartime guest players Category:English football managers Category:Swindon Town F.C. managers Category:Bury F.C. managers Category:Crystal Palace F.C. managers Category:Bath City F.C. managers Category:English Football League managers Category:Southern Football League managers ","title":"Bert Head"},{"id":"7821053","text":"John Freedley (May 22, 1793 – December 8, 1851) was a Whig member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania. ==Biography== John Freedley was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania.

Slavyanskaya Square () is the square in the center of Moscow, also known in 1924-1991 as northern side of Nogina Square (Площадь Ногина); the southern side of former Nogina Square is now called Varvarka Gates Square (Площадь Варварских Ворот). These two square separates central Kitai-gorod from eastward Tagansky District. They connect to Varvarka Street (west), Solyanka Street (east), Kitaigorodsky Lane (south), Staraya Square and Lubyansky Lane (north), completing the half-circle of Central Squares of Moscow around Moscow Kremlin and Kitai-gorod. ==Disambiguation== Slavyanskaya Square and southbound Varvarka Gates Square form a contiguous city square, but are officially different locations, a fact that may confuse even Muscovites. To add to this confusion, Staraya Square is not a square per se but a city street (closed to regular traffic) that discharges into Varvarka Gates Square. In the past, Staraya (Old) and Novaya (New) Squares frequently interchanged their names, too. Buildings with street numbers assigned to Slavyanskaya Square are: Church of All Saints on the southern side of the square and the 1900s office block behind it; all other buildings in the square are assigned to Lubyansky Lane and Varvarka Gates Square. ==History== Boyarsky Dvor offices by Fyodor Schechtel The area was urbanized within 15th century; Kitai-gorod wall was erected in the 1530s, on the raised hill. Existing Church of All Saints was built in the 1480s and subsequently rebuilt in the 17th century. Until 1934, territories inside the wall developed separately from the rest of the city, retaining medieval congestion until the 1890s despite numerous plans to redevelop Kitai-gorod. In the 1890s, Moscow Merchant Society consolidated the blocks within the wall, and built a string of majestic office buildings, notably Boyarsky Dvor facing Varvarka Gates and Staraya Square (by Fyodor Schechtel), 4 Staraya Square, former Communist Party Headquarters (by Vladimir Sherwood Jr.), and Delovoy Dvor (by Ivan Kuznetsov). The square and Solyanka Street acquired the finest examples of late Art Nouveau and Russian neoclassical revival, however, developers failed to obtain the permits for demolition of the wall. Delovoy Dvor used to face the demolished fortress wall and tower The boulevard north from the square was formed in two stages; first, the old Apple Market near Novaya Square was replaced with a boulevard across Polytechnical Museum (1880s, with the 1887 Plevna Monument). Next, the southern part of the boulevard was cleaned up with the demolition of Varvarka Gated market. The two squares acquired their present shape in 1934, when the State demolished Kitai- gorod tower blocking the exit from Varvarka Street and the fortress wall between Staraya Square and Kitaisky Lane. Remains of the tower are visible in an underground vestibule of Kitay-Gorod subway station. Monument to Saints Cyril and Methodius by Vyacheslav Klykov was opened on the northbound boulevard in 1992. The Square is a common starting point for public rallies; in particular, the 2006 Russian March of 4 November 2006. ==Public transportation access== * Southern vestibule of the Kitay-Gorod station of the Moscow Metro is located right under the square. * Kitay-Gorod bus terminal. ==References== Category:Squares in Moscow ","title":"Slavyanskaya Square"},{"id":"7821081","text":"Platform at Hua Lamphong Station for the Bangkok to Butterworth train The International Express (; ) is an express train between Bangkok, Thailand and Padang Besar, Malaysia. The train formerly traveled to Butterworth, Penang. This train's passenger cars include 2nd-class air conditioned sleepers, and an air conditioned dining car. Diesel electric locomotives such as HID (Hitachi - 2500 HP) and GEA (General Electric - 2500 HP) are used to Haul this express between Padang Besar and Hat Yai. ==History== The original name of this train was Southern Express. It was introduced on 2 January 1922 with sleeping cars, double-headed by two E-class locomotives, and ran every Monday (increased to twice a week, Wednesday and Saturday, by 1930) from Bangkok Noi railway station (now Thon Buri railway station). The terminus has changed from Bangkok Noi to Bangkok after the opening of Rama VI Bridge on 1 January 1927. It was a reduced Wednesday-only service from 1940 to 1945. The service was temporarily suspended from 15 March 1950 to 2 January 1954 due to war damage on the Southern line by bombs from Allied Forces during WWII as well as the insurgencies in southern Thailand and northern Malaya. The destruction of the Rama VI Bridge had compelled State Railway of Thailand (SRT) (replaced Royal State Railways (RSR) from 16 August 1939 to 1945) to use Thon Buri (Bangkok Noi) as the terminal for the International Express and the Hat Yai Express from 2 January 1944. The Hat Yai Express (Bangkok - Hat Yai) was substituted during the reduction of international service as well as during the suspension of international services even though it was introduced on 3 April 1939 (every Friday) to meet increasing demand from those who lived in southern provinces. The Hat Yai Express was extended to Su-ngai Kolok in January 1942. It was back to Hat Yai after 1945. The international service was resumed on the old schedule on 2 January 1954 after concluding a cross border treaty between SRT and the Federated Malay States Railways (FMSR). Customs checkpoint, Padang Besar Station Once there were enough diesel locomotives, the International Express ran daily. From 1966 to 1978 the service ran three times a week between Bangkok and Prai via Padang Besar (extended to Butterworth in 1967), and four times a week between Bangkok and Tumpat via Sungai Golok. After 1978, the International Express ran between Bangkok and Butterworth via Padang Besar only. The substitute the service to Tumpat is the Bangkok - Su-ngai Kolok express (see Thaksin Express). ==Timetable== , International Express trains depart Bangkok (Southbound Train 45) and Padang Besar (Northbound Train 46) daily. The journey takes roughly 18 hours. Between Bangkok and Hat Yai, the Train is Coupled at the South End of Special Express No. 37 and No. 38 on the Return Journey. No. 45 is separated from No. 37 at Hat Yai, to head for their different Destinations, and No. 46 is Reconnected to No. 38 at Hat Yai, to head for their same Destinations, Bangkok. However, Train No. 45 and No. 46’s Timetable does not appear on Google Maps. ==Route== Bangkok to Butterworth train, Butterworth Train Station The train passes cities and towns along the eastern gulf coast of southern Thailand on the upper Malay peninsula. These include Nakhon Pathom, Hua Hin, Surat Thani, Hat Yai. The train crosses the Thai-Malaysian border at Padang Besar before reaching Butterworth, which is opposite Penang Island, an island on the northern west coast of peninsular Malaysia. ==References== *Schedule for International Special Express 35 *Schedule for International Special Express 36 *KTMB Schedule for North & South Line, includes International Express 35 and 36 Category:International named passenger trains Category:Passenger rail transport in Malaysia Category:Night trains ","title":"International Express"},{"id":"7821099","text":"Michael Anthony Howard (born 2 December 1978) is an English footballer who plays as a defender who plays for Afan Lido. ==Career== Born in Birkenhead, Merseyside, Howard initially started his career with Liverpool before being signed as a trainee by Tranmere Rovers.

Today the basement is the location of Annabel's Annabel's was a London nightclub, located at 44 Berkeley Square, London. It was founded by entrepreneur Mark Birley and named after Lady Annabel Vane-Tempest-Stewart, then his wife. It closed in 2018. Annabel's was founded in 1963, after Birley's friend John Aspinall decided that they needed somewhere to party after an evening's gambling. As a result, Birley turned the basement of Aspinall's casino, the Clermont Club, into a nightclub, and named it after his then wife, Annabel, who went on to marry Birley's friend, Sir James Goldsmith. Birley later blocked off the private staircase linking the Clermont above. Annabel's was a members-only nightclub and catered to an exclusive clientele, including the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, Princess Anne, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, US President Richard Nixon, Aristotle Onassis and Frank Sinatra. In 2003, the Queen visited the club, and it is thought to be the only nightclub the Queen has ever attended. Entertainers who have played there include Tina Turner, Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald, Diana Ross, Bryan Ferry and Lady Gaga. The sumptuous interior which was originally designed by Birley and designer Nina Campbell, was later updated by Birley's daughter, India Jane, but the paintings from Birley's collection remained. ==New ownership== On 5 June 2007, after more than a year of negotiations, Annabel's was acquired by Richard Caring, a clothing tycoon and owner of The Ivy restaurant, in a deal thought to be worth £90 million. The deal also included the purchase of three other nightclubs including Mark's Club. The original Annabel's closed its doors in 2018. A successor day and night club was opened in a building nearby with a different membership. ==See also== * Superclub ==References== ==External links== *Annabel's official website Category:Nightclubs in London Category:Tourist attractions in the City of Westminster Category:1963 establishments in England Category:Grade I listed buildings in the City of Westminster Category:Grade I listed houses ","title":"Annabel's"},{"id":"7821143","text":"John Westbrook Hornbeck (January 24, 1804 – January 16, 1848) was a Whig member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania. ==Biography== Westbrook Hornbeck was born in Montague Township, New Jersey.

The legislation was proposed by Senator Harrison A. Williams of New Jersey. The Williams Act amended the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. § 78a et seq.) to require mandatory disclosure of information regarding cash tender offers. When an individual, group, or corporation seeks to acquire control of another corporation, it may make a tender offer. A tender offer is a proposal to buy shares of stock from the stockholders for cash or some type of corporate security of the acquiring company. Since the mid-1960s, cash tender offers for corporate takeovers have become favored over the traditional alternative, the proxy campaign. A proxy campaign is an attempt to obtain the votes of enough shareholders to gain control of the corporation's board of directors. Because of abuses with cash tender offers, Congress passed the Williams Act in 1968, whose purpose is to require full and fair disclosure for the benefit of stockholders, while at the same time providing the offeror and management equal opportunity to fairly present their cases. The act requires any person who makes a cash tender offer (which is usually 15-20% in excess of the current market price) for a corporation, that is required to be registered under federal law, to disclose to the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the source of the funds used in the offer, the purpose for which the offer is made, the plans the purchaser might have if successful, and any contracts or understandings concerning the target corporation. Filing and public disclosures with the SEC are also required of anyone who acquires more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of any class of a corporation subject to federal registration requirements. Copies of these disclosure statements must also be sent to each national securities exchange where the securities are traded, making the information available to shareholders and investors. The law also imposes miscellaneous substantive restrictions on the mechanics of a cash tender offer, and it imposes a broad prohibition against the use of false, misleading, or incomplete statements in connection with a tender offer. The law gives the SEC the authority to institute enforcement lawsuits. In recent years, as complicated forms of derivatives bearing upon but not actually constituting corporate stock have become common, interpretation of the Williams Act has become tricky. This development came to a head in 2008 over the railroad company CSX Corporation. ==See also== * Securities regulation in the United States * Commodity Futures Trading Commission * Securities Commission * Chicago Stock Exchange * Financial regulation * List of financial regulatory authorities by country * NASDAQ * New York Stock Exchange * Stock exchange * Regulation D (SEC) ;Related legislation * 1933 - Securities Act of 1933 * 1934 – Securities Exchange Act of 1934 * 1938 – Temporary National Economic Committee (establishment) * 1939 - Trust Indenture Act of 1939 * 1940 - Investment Advisers Act of 1940 * 1940 - Investment Company Act of 1940 * 1975 – Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 * 1982 – Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act * 1999 – Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act * 2000 – Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 * 2002 – Sarbanes–Oxley Act * 2006 - Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 * 2010 – Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Category:United States federal securities legislation Category:1968 in American law ","title":"Williams Act"},{"id":"7821180","text":"Old Oak Lane Halt railway station was the first station on the \\"New North Main Line\\" (NNML, present-day Acton–Northolt line) of the Great Western Railway.

(15 July 1737 - 23 December 1787) was a French princess and Carmelite, the youngest of the ten children of Louis XV and Maria Leszczyńska. She entered the Carmelite convent (now the Musée d'art et d'histoire de Saint-Denis) at Saint-Denis in 1770 under the name of Thérèse of Saint Augustine, and served as prioress in 1773-1779 and 1785-1787. She was declared venerable in 1873. ==Birth== Louise-Marie of France was born at Versailles on 15 July 1737. Her birth was particularly difficult for her mother, who was advised by her physicians that another birth could be fatal. After this, the queen discontinued sexual relations with the king by refusing him entrance to her bedroom. Not long after this Louis XV, with approval of his minister Cardinal de Fleury, officially acknowledged his first favorite, Louise Julie de Mailly, and the private relationship between the king and queen was discontinued and they started to live separate lives. The king openly announced this after the birth of Louise when he called her Madame Dernière ('Madame the Last'). As the legitimate daughter of the king, she held the rank of a fille de France, but was as her sisters referred to by the number of her birth, in her case \\"Madame Septième\\",Ravel, Jeffrey, Studies in Eighteenth-Century Culture, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007, p. 125, but from 1740 onward,L.

Douniol, 1872. ==Fontevraud== In June 1738, the four youngest princesses, Victoire, Sophie and Thérèse (who died at Fontevraud at the age of eight) and Louise, were sent to be raised at the Abbaye de Fontevraud, because the cost of raising them in Versailles with all the status they were entitled to was deemed too expensive by Cardinal Fleury, Louis XV's chief minister, in particular because the new cost of an official mistress had been added to the expenses since the king recognized his favorite. Their trip was described: \\"the princesses, who departed from Court in eight coaches and two chaises with twenty wagon loads of luggage, arrived at Fontevrault after a journey lasting thirteen days. The Abbess, who was a Rochechouart-Mortemart, took the trouble to receive them clad all in white and accompanied by four singing girls. She desired that on their arrival the Royal children should be greeted by attractive faces, and colors which would please them.\\" On 20 December 1738 Louise was baptised at Fontevraud; her godfather was François-Marc-Antoine de Bussy, seigneur de Bisé; her godmother was Marie-Louise Bailly-Adenet, first woman of the chamber to her sister Madame Thérèse. The Abbaye de Fontevraud had been selected because of its status, as it was a prestigious establishment where the abbess was always a member of the highest nobility, but it was not an educational institution, and according to Madame Campan, the sisters were subjected to traumatic disciplinarian methods and neglected in their education: Louise was described as lively, intelligent, talkative and haughty, and did not hesitate to lecture her staff and demand to be treated with veneration because of her status as princess, such as demanding that those in her service to rise when she entered the room. The nuns worked to subdue her pride, in particular a Mme de Soulanges, and a well known anecdote describes how Louise lectured one of her servant women, who in her view had not been humble enough, by saying: \\"Am I not the daughter of your King?\\", upon which the woman replied, apparently upon the instruction of de Soulanges: \\"And I Madame am I not the daughter of your God?” Another anecdote relates how Louise demanded that all present should rise when a member of the royal house drank: \\"Stand, ladies! Louise drinks!”, upon which de Soulanges exclaimed: \\"Remain seated”. Physically, Louise was not considered to be beautiful and reportedly suffered from a weak constitution, having a curvature of the spine which resulted in what she called a \\"hump\\" on her back, and according to the duke de Luynes: \\"Madame Louise's head was a little too big for her body”. Already in 1748, when Louise, aged 11, was still in Fontevraud, rumors began to circulate that her father intended her to marry Prince Charles Edward Stuart, pretender to the throne of England. Louise then declared: ==Madame Louise== In the spring of 1748, her elder sister Victoire successfully asked permission to return to court, and in November 1750, Louise and her remaining sister Sophie were allowed to return as well, age 13 and 16 respectively. Madame Louise by Drouais, ca. 1770. While their education had been neglected in the convent, they reportedly compensated for this and studied extensively after their return to court, encouraged by their brother, with whom they immediately formed a close attachment: \\"When Mesdames, still very young, returned to Court, they enjoyed the friendship of Monseigneur the Dauphin, and profited by his advice. They devoted themselves ardently to study, and gave up almost the whole of their time to it; they enabled themselves to write French correctly, and acquired a good knowledge of history. Italian, English, the higher branches of mathematics, turning and dialing, filled up in succession their leisure moments.\\"Madame Campan, Memoirs of the Court of Marie Antoinette, Queen of France, Project Gutenberg Madame Louise never married, and became a part of the group of the four unmarried princesses referred to collectively as Mesdames de France at court. The King referred to them by nicknames: he called Madame Adelaide ‘Logue’ [Tatters], Madame Victoire ‘Coche’ [Piggy], Madame Sophie, ‘Graille’ [Mite], and Madame Louise, ‘Chiffie’ [Rubbish]. Madame Louise by François-Hubert Drouais, ca. 1763. The life of Louise and her sisters were described by their reader as follows: \\"Louis XV. saw very little of his family. He came every morning by a private staircase into the apartment of Madame Adelaide. He often brought and drank there coffee that he had made himself. Madame Adelaide pulled a bell which apprised Madame Victoire of the King’s visit; Madame Victoire, on rising to go to her sister’s apartment, rang for Madame Sophie, who in her turn rang for Madame Louise. The apartments of Mesdames were of very large dimensions. Madame Louise occupied the farthest room. This latter lady was deformed and very short; the poor Princess used to run with all her might to join the daily meeting, but, having a number of rooms to cross, she frequently in spite of her haste, had only just time to embrace her father before he set out for the chase. Every evening, at six, Mesdames interrupted my reading to them to accompany the princes to Louis XV.; this visit was called the King’s ‘debotter’,—[Debotter, meaning the time of unbooting.]—and was marked by a kind of etiquette. Mesdames put on an enormous hoop, which set out a petticoat ornamented with gold or embroidery; they fastened a long train round their waists, and concealed the undress of the rest of their clothing by a long cloak of black taffety which enveloped them up to the chin. The chevaliers d’honneur, the ladies in waiting, the pages, the equerries, and the ushers bearing large flambeaux, accompanied them to the King. In a moment the whole palace, generally so still, was in motion; the King kissed each Princess on the forehead, and the visit was so short that the reading which it interrupted was frequently resumed at the end of a quarter of an hour; Mesdames returned to their apartments, and untied the strings of their petticoats and trains; they resumed their tapestry, and I my book.\\" Louise, as the other two younger sisters, were reportedly dominated by their eldest sister Madame Adelaide, who engaged herself in political intrigues and campaigns against their father's mistresses. While this submission to their senior sister's rank and dominant nature was not such a problem for the easygoing Victoire or the retiring and reserved Sophie, Madame Louise, who was herself of an intelligent and energetic nature, found this position harder, inspiring in her feelings of oppression and enslavement. During her first years at court, Louise reportedly indulged in pleasure, and was for a time considered the most worldly of her sisters: \\"She was passionately fond of every pleasure, was something of a glutton, very fond of dress, incapable of living without every new invention of luxury, had a lively imagination and great leaning to coquetry.\\"Boigne, Louise-Eléonore-Charlotte-Adélaide d'Osmond, Memoirs of the Comtesse de Boigne (1781-1814), London, Heinemann, 1907 Many years later, when Louise had left court to enter a convent without informing her sisters, and the King came into the room of her sister Adelaide and told her that Louise had gone away in the night, her first cry was reportedly: \\"With whom?\\". In 1761, when her sister Victoire visited the waters in Lorraine for medical purposes for the first time in the company of Adelaide, Louise and her sister Sophie visited Paris for the first time. A series of events in the 1760s lead to a crisis in the life of Louise. On 26 November 1764, she was deeply affected by the banishment of the Jesuits from France, and resolved to secure their return, as well as the conversion of the king's soul. In the following year, the death of her brother Dauphin in December 1765, followed by that of her sister-in-law, Dauphine Maria Josepha in 1767 and mother queen Maria Leszczyńska in June 1768, and the presentation at court of the Comtesse du Barry, the new favorite of Louis XV, pushed Louise approach Christophe de Beaumont, Archbishop of Paris, asking him to intercede on her behalf with her father the King of her desire to enter the Carmelites, a cloistered and austere Order, at the convent of Saint-Denis. ==Entrance to the Order of the Carmelites== Thérèse of Saint Augustine, École française, ca. 1771. Even before becoming a Carmelite, Louise had begun in secret to wear religious dress and live the convent life while living at Versailles. The King gave his written consent on 16 February 1770. This was at the same time as the court prepared for the marriage of the new Dauphin (the future Louis XVI) and Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria.Hare, Augustus John Cuthbert, North- Eastern France, Macmillan, 1896, p. 143.Markham, Jacob Abbott, A History of France, Harper & Brothers, 1863, p. 143. The words, \\"I Carmelite, and the King all to God\\", reflected Louise's willingness to redeem with her sacrifice the soul of her father, and expiate his sins.Vincent, Bernard, Louis XVI, Folio, coll. «Folio biographies», February 2006, 368 p. , p. 23. In April 1770, Louise left court accompanied only by her coach, one maid-of-honour and an equerry. Her departure was very hasty and sudden and created a great surprise at court. The reader of Louise, Campan, described the events around the departure of Louise from court: \\"Madame Louise had for many years lived in great seclusion; I read to her five hours a day. My voice frequently betrayed the exhaustion of my lungs; the Princess would then prepare sugared water for me, place it by me, and apologise for making me read so long, on the score of having prescribed a course of reading for herself. One evening, while I was reading, she was informed that M. Bertin, ‘ministre des parties casuelles’, desired to speak with her; she went out abruptly, returned, resumed her silks and embroidery, and made me resume my book; when I retired she commanded me to be in her closet the next morning at eleven o’clock. When I got there the Princess was gone out; I learnt that she had gone at seven in the morning to the Convent of the Carmelites of St. Denis, where she was desirous of taking the veil. I went to Madame Victoire; there I heard that the King alone had been acquainted with Madame Louise’s project; that he had kept it faithfully secret, and that, having long previously opposed her wish, he had only on the preceding evening sent her his consent; that she had gone alone into the convent, where she was expected; and that a few minutes afterwards she had made her appearance at the grating, to show to the Princesse de Guistel, who had accompanied her to the convent gate, and to her equerry, the King’s order to leave her in the monastery. As soon as I obtained permission to do so, I went to St. Denis to see my late mistress; she deigned to receive me with her face uncovered, in her private parlour; she told me she had just left the wash-house, and that it was her turn that day to attend to the linen. “I much abused your youthful lungs for two years before the execution of my project,” added she. “I knew that here I could read none but books tending to our salvation, and I wished to review all the historians that had interested me.” Louise chose to enter the convent at Saint-Denis.Baedeker, Karl, Paris and Environs with Routes from London to Paris, Dulau, 1898, p. 348. Threatened with closure owing to limited financial resources, the convent was now unexpectedly saved by the arrival of a nun with a large dowry,Madame Louise de France (Mère Thérèse de St Augustin): L’entrée au Carmel (in French) [retrieved 21 September 2016]. which in turn further attracted significant donations. Louise assumed the habit of the Carmelites on 10 October 1770. The recently married Dauphine Maria Antoinette gave her the veil. She took her religious vows on 12 September 1771 in a lavish ceremony in which the Papal Nuncio presided, dressed in white satin and wearing a million worth of diamonds, in the presence of the king and the rest of the royal family. This time, another of her nieces-in-law, the Countess of Provence, in a very formal ceremony, bestowed upon her the black veil of the Carmelites. With her investiture, Louise chose the name Thérèse of Saint Augustine in honor of Teresa of Ávila, a mystic and reformer of the Carmelite Order. Upon entering the convent, she stated her wish that her cell should be more bare than that of the other Carmelites. ==Carmelite== Louis XV visiting his youngest daughter, by Maxime Le Boucher, 1882. Immediately after she entered the convent, Louise was appointed mistress of novices. Her duties included overseeing no less than 13 young novices.Madame Louise de France (Mère Thérèse de St Augustin): Maîtresse des novices (in French) [retrieved 22 September 2016]. By the end of 1771, Louise was entrusted with the economy of the convent. In 1779 she organized the rebuilding of the ruined church which Richard Mique oversaw. After her renunciation, Louise came to be in a far more influential position of status than what she had been as the youngest of princesses, and she was reportedly consulted as an authority figure by the king her father, the princes, the ambassadors, the bishops and the archbishops. Her relationship to her sisters never quite recovered after she left court: \\"The three sisters who were left never pardoned Madame Louise for concealing her intentions, and though they went to see her sometimes, it was with no feelings of pleasure or friendship. Her death was no grief to them.\\" Like her sisters, however, she opposed the wedding of her nephew the Dauphin to Maria Antoinette of Austria, this marriage having been concluded by Choiseul, whom she detested because of his banishment of the Jesuits. This confidence in her counsel did attract attention by contemporaries, \\"The retirement of Madame Louise, and her removal from Court, had only served to give her up entirely to the intrigues of the clergy. She received incessant visits from bishops, archbishops, and ambitious priests of every rank; she prevailed on the King, her father, to grant many ecclesiastical preferments, and probably looked forward to playing an important part when the King, weary of his licentious course of life, should begin to think of religion. This, perhaps, might have been the case had not a sudden and unexpected death put an end to his career. The project of Madame Louise fell to the ground in consequence of this event.\\" While the intrigues of her sisters Mesdames made them exposed to some hostility, Louise was, despite her political activity, not exposed to the same feelings, though \\"only her habit saved Sister Therese from being included in this unpopularity.\\" === Prioress === Louise was elected prioress of the convent on 25 November 1773. She served as prioress from 1773 to 1779 in two consecutive terms, and a third term from 1785.Leathes, Stanley, The religion of the Christ, its historic and literary development, Oxford University, 1874, p. 356 Louis XV died on 10 May 1774. On 26 May, two weeks after his death, his grandson, Louis XVI (nephew of Louise) visited his aunt at Saint-Denis.La Gazette de France (27 mai 1774): 109. Reportedly, Louise continued to solicit favors for others during the reign of her nephew: \\"She remained in her convent, whence she continued to solicit favours, as I knew from the complaints of the Queen, who often said to me, “Here is another letter from my Aunt Louise. She is certainly the most intriguing little Carmelite in the kingdom.” When the interest of the Carmelite Order was at stake, she readily corresponded with the powers that be in order to argue on behalf of the Order.Madame Louise de France (Mère Thérèse de St Augustin): Carmélite et princesse (in French) [retrieved 22 September 2016]. She was often visited by her niece Madame Élisabeth, who wished to unite her prayers with that of her aunt for the king's welfare.Maxwell-Scott, Mary Monica, Madame Elizabeth de France, 1764-1794, London : E. Arnold, 1908 An anecdote is given about one such visit; \\"Mme Elizabeth arrived at the convent one day quite early, and begged to be allowed to wait on the nuns at their dinner. Leave being granted, she put on an apron and, after kissing the ground, went to the Tour to receive the dishes. All went well, till, as she was distributing the portions, the tray slipped and a dish fell. Her embarrassment was extreme. To relieve her, the august Princess said, 'My niece. After such a gaucherie the culprit should kiss the floor.' This Mme Elizabeth hastened to do, and then cheerfully resumed her office of waitress.\\" Louise gave assistance to the Carmelites nuns who had left Austria after being expelled by Emperor Joseph II, finding them a place in other French Carmel convents. In June 1783, she hosted 13 Carmelite nuns who were driven from Brussels. The persecution against them was so intense, that, for a time, 58 Carmelite nuns lived at Saint-Denis. Eventually, with the onset of the French Revolution and the closure of convents, the Carmelites were forced to leave France for other countries.Madame Louise de France (Mère Thérèse de St Augustin): Témoignage de l’auteur de la présentation (in French) [retrieved 22 September 2016]. Louise also involved in politics and state affairs in regards to religious laws. In November 1787, her nephew Louis XVI granted non-Catholics in France the right to openly practice their religions as well as legal and civil status by the Edict of Versailles. Louise vehemently opposed this law, and sent an eight page long letter of protest to Louis XVI in which she attacked the Protestants and reproached the king. ===Death=== Thérèse of Saint Augustine died on 23 December 1787 in Saint-Denis, after suffering from a stomach complaint. Somewhat more than a year later, began the French Revolution which deposed her family from the throne, and ousted from power the Catholic Church in France.See also: Martyrs of Compiègne and the :fr:Pontons de Rochefort Her last words were: Her nephew king Louis XVI describe these words more in detail when he informed her former reader Campan of her death: \\"I was informed of her death by Louis XVI. “My Aunt Louise,” said he to me, “your old mistress, is just dead at St. Denis. I have this moment received intelligence of it. Her piety and resignation were admirable, and yet the delirium of my good aunt recalled to her recollection that she was a princess, for her last words were, ‘To paradise, haste, haste, full speed.’ No doubt she thought she was again giving orders to her equerry.” In 1793 the revolutionaries who desecrated the tombs of the kings of France at the Basilica of St Denis did the same to the cemetery of the Carmelite convent. Located near the cloister, the remains of the royal family were disinterred and thrown into a mass grave. ==Beatification== The process of Thérèse of Saint Augustine's beatification took place between 1855 and 1867. Pope Pius IX declared her venerable on 19 June 1873, officially initiating the process of beatification. The process (required at the time) of non-cult takes place in 1885-1886. The process of sanctity was conducted in 1891-1892, and the process of the virtues held from 1896 to 1904. The decree validating these processes was published on 28 November 1906. Clerics resumed steps toward Thérèse's canonization in Rome under new protocols on 13 December 1985.Madame Louise de France (Mère Thérèse de St Augustin): La cause de béatification (in French) [retrieved 23 September 2016]. An association was founded in January 1986 to support the cause of her beatification.

It was known in historical times for its supposed healing properties; this tradition continues among the town's large New Age community. The name is also applied to Leechwell Lane, which leads to the spring from three directions. ==History== ===Early history=== Towards the end of the twelfth century, a leper hospital was established on the outskirts of Totnes. It is a popular belief in the town that lepers would walk up the high-walled Leechwell Lane to St Mary's church. However this belief cannot be traced back beyond the nineteenth century, and seems unlikely as lepers were ostracised, and the hospital was Church-run and would have had its own services. One branch of the lane leads to Maudlin (derived from Magdalen) Road, the site of the hospital, which is no longer extant after closing in about 1660. ===Springs used for healing=== Close-up of the well, showing the springs (L-R) Toad, Long Crippler and Snake open at the base of the far wall, filling the three rectangular basins in the floor. The springs were used by the townspeople for healing purposes, most probably for skin and eye conditions, and the troughs into which the outlets poured gained the names Toad, Long Crippler and Snake (long crippler being a local word for the slowworm). Their use became so popular that the Leechwell was included in a list of sites to be minded by two town wardens in 1444. ===Modern times=== In 2003 it was discovered that an overgrown and forgotten pool behind one of the walls was in fact a rare triangular immersion pool fed by the Leechwell's waters. This meant that the Leechwell complex was a trinity of trinities — the triple spring, the three-pronged path and triangular pool emphasising the importance of the number three in both Christianity and superstition. The triangular immersion pool, which like the Leechwell is listed, will actually become a key feature of the Leechwell Garden, a new public open space. Work on the garden will start when the current building work is completed and the set of portacabins is removed. The design and implementation of the garden will be a joint collaboration between South Hams District Council and the Leechwell Garden Association. ==The Leechwell today== Although the Leechwell and its walls still stand, they have no formal protection, and the walls have twice been damaged in the name of improvement - by road building in the 1960s and again during work on a car park in 2006, which reduced that part of the wall by several feet. However, the site has many vocal defenders, especially the group Design Our Space, which did much to prevent inappropriate development of that area in the mid-2000s. The Leechwell is used as a place of worship by the local New Age community, who often decorate it with ribbons and trinkets, but without causing damage to the stonework. In recent years it appears that the right hand spring has moved its outlet point so that it no longer pours into the trough built for it. This might be due to the new houses built on the slopes above the area. ==References== * ==External links== * Design Our Space * Pictures of the Leechwell * The Leechwell on Youtube * Leechwell Garden Association Category:Holy wells in England Category:Springs of England Category:Landforms of Devon Category:English architecture Category:Medieval architecture Category:Totnes ","title":"Leechwell"},{"id":"7821288","text":"Prominent nationalists at the Sivas Congress. Left to right: Muzaffer Kılıç, Rauf (Orbay), Bekir Sami (Kunduh), Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk), Ruşen Eşref (Ünaydın), Cemil Cahit (Toydemir), Cevat Abbas (Gürer) The Sivas Congress () was an assembly of the Turkish National Movement held for one week from 4 to 11 September 1919 in the city of Sivas, in central-eastern Turkey, which united delegates from all Anatolian provinces of the Ottoman Empire, defunct at the time in practical terms. At the time of the convention, the state capital (Constantinople) as well as many provincial cities and regions were under occupation by the Allied powers preparing for the partition of the Ottoman Empire. This was part of the wider conflict of the Turkish War of Independence. The congress took place in a high school == Resolutions == The call for the congress had been issued by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk with his Amasya Circular three months before and the preparatory work had been handled during the Erzurum Congress. The congress at Sivas took a number of vital decisions which were foundational in shaping the future policy to be conducted in the frame of the Turkish War of Independence. The Congress also united the multiple regional Defense of Rights Associations into the The Association of the Defence of Rights of Anatolia and Rumelia. Although smaller than the Erzurum Congress (with 38 delegates), the delegates came from a wider geographical area than was the case with the Erzurum Congress. Along with the Erzurum Congress, the Sivas Congress determined the main points of the Misak-ı Millî (National Pact) that the Turkish National Movement made with other Turkish resistance movements against the Allies to work together, namely the imperial government in Constantinople. The two bodies signed the Amasya Protocol the next month on 22 October 1919, calling for new elections after which the Ottoman Chamber of Deputies would consider the agreements of the Sivas Congress. Once word reached the occupying Allies in Constantinople, however, they dissolved the parliament, after which the remaining vestiges of the Ottoman imperial government would become antagonistic against the Turkish National Movement based in Ankara. == Legacy == After the war of independence, The Association of the Defence of Rights of Anatolia and Rumelia would become a formal political party and rename themselves to the Republican People's Party (CHP) and retroactively declared the Sivas Congress their first Congress. The CHP is one of Turkey's major political parties to this day. The building where the Sivas Congress took place was acquired by the Ministry of Culture in 1984 at the request of President Kenan Evren.

Later the company focused on pulp, paper and timber production and machinery, later expanding to glassworks (Iittala and Karhula). Ahlstrom's paper production began in Varkaus in 1921 on Europe's largest paper production machine. By the beginning of the 1930s, Ahlstrom had grown into Finland's largest industrial conglomerate. The outbreak of World War II led the company to convert much of its production to support the Finnish war effort. Following the war, the company played a major role in Finland's reconstruction and in its war reparations obligation. Ahlstrom alone accounted for nearly 15 percent of the country's total reparations. The company continued to expand into the 1950s, stepping up its engineering operations while also expanding into chemical wood processing technology. Ahlstrom Corporation began to rapidly grow internationally in 1963, by acquiring a majority interest in a paper mill in Mathi close to Turin, Italy, that produced filter papers and rifle cartridge paper. This was the first significant international acquisition made by a Finnish company and made Ahlstrom a pioneer among major Finnish companies in internationalization. The town of Varkaus grew up around the A. Ahlström paper mills. In the 1930s, the Sunila Plant in Karhula (now Kotka), designed by Alvar Aalto, was built by Ahlström. In the 1980s, in a large swap of facilities, the Varkaus works were handed over to Enso Gutzeit (now Stora Enso). During the 1980s, Ahlstrom left the newsprint and magazine paper market and focused its operations on specialty papers. One of the most profound decisions in Finnish industrial history was made in 1987, when Ahlstrom unexpectedly sold its paper-producing units. Leaving newsprint production increased the relative value of Ahlstrom's specialty paper and engineering units. In the 1990s, Ahlstrom expanded its focus to include nonwoven products. At the end of 1996, Ahlstrom Corporation continued its expansion by acquiring the French specialty paper and nonwovens producer Sibille-Dalle. During that same year, Ahlstrom Corporation established the Ahlstrom Paper Group to encompass the company’s fiber-based materials operations. In 2000, Ahlstrom acquired Dexter Corporation's nonwovens production facilities in the United States, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Today, Ahlstrom is among the largest Nordic companies. The Ahlström family are still significant shareholders in the Ahlstrom Corporation. In 2001, the group split into three companies. The manufacturing divisions were transferred to the now public Ahlstrom Corporation. Ahlstrom Capital Oy was established as a private investment company. And A.Ahlstrom Osakeyhtio was established as a private forestry and real estate management company. In October 2005, Professor Johan Erik Gullichsen, chairman of Ahlstrom Corporation, was inducted into the Paper Industry International Hall of Fame for his innovations in the processing of pulp fiber suspensions at medium consistency. In 2012 Ahlstrom Corporation announced that its Label and Processing business area will be combined with Munksjö Group to create a world leader in specialty papers. In 2016 Ahlstrom Corporation and Munksjö Oyj announced a plan merge the two companies In 2017 Ahlstrom sold its Osnabruck, Germany plant to Kammerer The completion of the merger of Ahlstrom Corporation into Munksjö Oyj was registered with the Finnish Trade Register on 1 April 2017. Following the completion of the merger, the name of the combined company has changed to Ahlstrom-Munksjö Oyj (“Ahlstrom-Munksjö”). Trading in the new Ahlstrom-Munksjö shares issued to Ahlstrom’s shareholders as merger consideration commenced 1 April 2017 on the Nasdaq Helsinki (trading code: AM1) and Nasdaq Stockholm (trading code: AM1S) stock exchanges.http://www.ahlstrom-munksjo.com/Media/releases/other-stock-exchange- and-press-releases/2017/ahlstrom-munksjo-oyj-the-merger-of-munksjo-and- ahlstrom-has-been-registered-and-the-board-of-directors-has-elected-the- chairman-and-vice-chairmen/ == See also == * Ahlström — Gullichsen family * List of Finnish companies * List of oldest companies * Stora Enso == References == ==External links== * Company Website Category:Companies established in 1851 Category:Companies listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange Category:Finnish brands Category:Pulp and paper companies of Finland Category:Manufacturing companies based in Helsinki Category:Textile companies of Finland Category:1851 establishments in the Russian Empire ","title":"Ahlstrom-Munksjö"},{"id":"7821378","text":"John Strohm (October 16, 1793 - September 12, 1884) was an American politician from Pennsylvania who served as a Whig member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Pennsylvania's 8th congressional district from 1845 to 1849. ==Early life== John Strohm was born in the part of Little Britain Township which formed the current Fulton Township to David and Ann Herr Strohm. He was home-schooled by is mother and encouraged to read newspapers and books. When he was twelve, his family moved to Strasbugh Township where his parents had been raised. For the next four years, he worked on the family farm and attended school for only three to four months during the winter until he reached age 16. After completing school, he continued working on the farm until 1815, except for a three-month period in 1813 where he taught school. In the fall of 1815, at age 22, he again taught school. This time it was in West Lampeter Township from 1815–1821, after which he resumed farming. He moved to Providence Township in 1833 and lived there for forty-nine years. ==Political career== In 1830, without his knowledge, friends attempted to nominate him for the state Legislature. They were successful in the following year and he was elected, and twice re-elected, serving three consecutive one year terms. He was elected as an anti-mason. In 1834, he was nominated and elected to the Pennsylvania Senate for the 6th district and served two four-year terms. In 1845, he was elected to the United States Congress and served two two-year terms. ===Political Office Chronology=== *member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives (1832 - 1834) *member (Anti-Masonic) of the Pennsylvania State Senate from the 7th District (1835 - 1836) **chair of the Claims Committee (1836 - 1838) *member (Anti-Masonic) of the Pennsylvania State Senate from the 6th District (1837 - 1842) **chair of the Claims Committee (1839) **chair of the Road, Bridges, and Inland Waterways Committee (1839) **chair of the Pensions and Gratuities Committee (1840 - 1841) **chair of the Improvement Committee (1841) *speaker of the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1842. *member (Whig) of the 29th United States Congress from the 8th District (1845 - 1846) *member (Whig) of the 30th United States Congress from the 8th District (1847 - 1848) *delegate to the 1848 Whig National Convention *delegate to the 1852 Whig National Convention *Justice of the Peace in Providence Township (1859 - 1880) *delegate to the 1869 Pennsylvania Republican State Convention ===Pennsylvania Senate Highlights=== During his first term, Senator Strohm backed the chartering of the Second Bank of the United States as a state institution after its rechartering in the Bank War by the US Congress failed. The effort failed. He supported Thaddeus Stevens's 1836 personal and property tax repeal and opposed the 1836 public school act. In his second term, after the Buckshot War, he broke from his party as one of two dissenting votes that enabled Democrat Ebeneezer Kingsbury's passage of the 1840 tax-bill, which raised taxes at a time that the State was nearly insolvent. He also strongly advocated new revenue programs in support of the fledgling education system. Strohm promoted freshman William Bigler's 1842 revenue-appropriations-bank bill. After Bigler spoke about his bill, Senator John Strohm prophetically said to Bigler: \\"Young man, that speech will make you Governor of Pennsylvania, if you behave yourself well hereafter.\\" Bigler was elected governor in 1851. ===Congressional Service=== During his second term, he lived with Abraham Lincoln in a Washington, DC boarding house. Strohm was a pro- abolition Whig legislator. He retired from Congress in 1849. ==Post- Congressional Period== Strohm returned to Pennsylvania worked as a Surveyor and served as Justice of the Peace in Providence from 1859 through 1880. Strohm was a member of the board of directors of the Strasburg Bank during its founding. He was also a member of the board of the Farmers' Mutual Insurance Company, being its secretary for thirty-six years and president for two years. He was president of the Big Spring and Beaver Valley Turnpike, and treasurer of the Providence Township School Board for six years. In 1882, Strohm moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He died there in 1884 at age 93 and was interred in the Mellinger Mennonite Cemetery in Lancaster. ==Personal life== Strohm was married in 1817 to Susannah Herr Barr, who died in 1832. After 23 years as a widower, he married Anne Witmer in 1857 after his time in Washington, DC. ==References== - Category:1793 births Category:1884 deaths Category:19th- century American politicians Category:American Mennonites Category:Burials in Pennsylvania Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania Category:Members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Category:Pennsylvania state senators Category:Pennsylvania Whigs Category:People from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania Category:Whig Party members of the United States House of Representatives ","title":"John Strohm (congressman)"},{"id":"7821385","text":"Tapalqué Partido is a central partido of Buenos Aires Province in Argentina.

Erzurum Congress () was an assembly of Turkish Revolutionaries held from 23 July to 4 August 1919 in the city of Erzurum, in eastern Turkey, in accordance with the previously issued Amasya Circular. The congress united delegates from six eastern provinces (vilayets) of the Ottoman Empire, many parts of which were under Allied occupation at the time. The congress played a fundamental role in shaping the national identity of modern Turkey. ==Background== ===Mudros Armistice=== In the months leading up to the end of World War I, the Ottoman regime had undergone major restructuring. The government ministers of the Committee of Union and Progress, which ran the Ottoman government between 1913 and 1918, had resigned from office and fled the country soon afterwards. Successful Allied offensives in Salonika posed a direct threat to the Ottoman capital of Constantinople.Findley, Carter Vaughn. Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity. Yale University Press, 2010, p. 215 Mehmed VI appointed Ahmed Izzet Pasha to the position of Grand Vizier and tasked him with the assignment of seeking an armistice with the Allied Powers and ending Ottoman involvement in the war.Lewis, Bernard. The Emergence of Modern Turkey. Oxford University Press, 1968, p. 239 On 30 October 1918, an armistice was signed between the Ottomans, represented by the Minister of the Navy Rauf Bey, and the Allies, represented by British Admiral Somerset Gough-Calthorpe. The armistice ended Ottoman participation in the war and required the Empire's forces to stand down although there still remained approximately one million soldiers in the field and small scale fighting continued in the frontier provinces into November.Findley, Carter Vaughn. Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity. Yale University Press, 2010, p. 215 ===Allied Occupation=== The victors of the First World War soon set about military occupation and partitioning of the Empire. The Ottoman frontier provinces in Arabia and Palestine were already under the control of the British and French. Following the signing of the armistice, Allied warships moved into the straits off the coast of Constantinople in order to secure the Dardanelles. In February 1919, French general Franchet d'Espèrey led a Greek occupation force into the city. The Anatolian province of Antalya was occupied by the Italians and the area of Cilicia and the Adana Vilayet were under the control of French forces advancing from Syria.Lewis, p. 240 By the end of 1918, regional resistance groups were already beginning to form called \\"Associations for the Defense of Rights\\" or Mudafaai Hukuk.Lewis, p. 246 ===Greek Occupation=== The turning point in the Turkish National Movement began on 14 May 1919 when Greek occupation forces landed in the city of Smyrna in the Province of İzmir. The city of Smyrna and the surrounding area contained a sizable Greek community.Llewellyn Smith, Michael. Ionian Vision: Greece in Asia Minor 1919-1922. St. Martin's Press, New York, 1973, p. 88 Greek forces had made it clear of their intentions of a permanent annexation of the İzmir Province. Greek forces almost immediately met with fierce protest and resistance from the Turkish population, many of whom had attained small arms from local caches.Llewellyn Smith, p. 90 News of the Greek occupation quickly spread through the Empire and fueled Turkish resentment of the Allied occupation. ===Mustafa Kemal and the Turkish War of Independence=== As Greek forces were trying to cement their holdings in İzmir, a young Ottoman military officer named Mustafa Kemal (later to be known as Atatürk) was headed for his assignment as Inspector of the Eastern Provinces. He was tasked with the responsibility of keeping peace and order in the provinces and overseeing the disbanding of remaining Ottoman regiments. On the 19th of May, Kemal arrived at the Black Sea port city of Samsun. In defiance of Ottoman orders, Kemal began to organize a nationalist Turkish resistance movement, completely separated from the Ottoman regime in Constantinople, with the intent to defend the territories of Anatolia from intrusion of the foreign powers.Llewellyn Smith, p.103 On the 28th of June, the British Assistant High Commissioner in Constantinople, Rear Admiral Richard Webb wrote a statement to Sir Richard Graham on the state of the Turkish resistance in the eastern Empire and the blossoming Greco-Turkish conflict. ===Meeting at Amasya=== In June 1919, Kemal held a secret meeting with several prominent Turkish statesman and military leaders including Ali Fuat Pasha and Hüseyin Rauf (Rauf Orbay) in the town of Amasya. The Amasya meeting kept in remote communication with Turkish General Kâzım Karabekir Pasha who was in command of the 15th Army Corps stationed at Erzurum at the time.Lewis, p. 247 The meeting set forth the ideological groundwork for the future Turkish National Movement and subsequent Congress of Erzurum. Following the meeting at Amasya, Kemal issued a telegram to many Turkish civil and military figures laying out the ideas expressed by the Turkish nationalists at Amasya. Below is the opening statement of the so- called Amasya Circular * 1. The integrity of the country, the independence of the nation are in danger. * 2. The central government is unable to discharge the duties for which it is responsible. As a result, the nation is regarded as nonexistent. * 3. Only the will and resolution of the nation can save the independence of the nation.Lewis, p. 247 Meanwhile, General Kâzım Karabekir began issuing invitations for a gathering of Turkish Eastern Anatolian delegates to be held in the city of Erzurum. Kemal continued to Erzurum to begin the task of setting up the meeting of Turkish delegates. In order to avoid any charges of treason or rebellion against the still legitimate Ottoman Sultanate, Kemal resigned from his post.Lewis, p. 248 To maintain a semblance of legality, Kemal gained the support of the Association for the Defence of the Rights of Eastern Anatolia, a Defence of Rights Association which was founded in Erzurum in March 1919 and was legally registered and recognized by the vilayet of Erzurum.Lewis, p. 248 ==Proceedings== On 23 July 1919, a congress of fifty-six delegates from the vilayets of Bitlis, Erzurum, Sivas, Trabzon and Van gathered in Erzurum for the assembly called by Mustafa Kemal and Kâzım Karabekir. On the first day of the proceedings, the delegates elected Mustafa Kemal as chairman of the congress. The congress made a number of important decisions that were to shape the future conduct of the Turkish War of Independence. Namely, it reaffirmed the provinces' desires to remain within the Ottoman Empire (rather than be partitioned by the Allies); refused to accept any mandate scheme for the empire nor accord Christian elements such as Greeks or Armenians with any special privileges; and resolved to resist any such measures, should they try to be implemented.Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, p. 436.\\"Erzurum Kongresi Kararları (23 Temmuz - 7 Ağustos 1919)\\"http://www.kultur.gov.tr/TR/belge/1-24086/erzurum-kongresi- kararlari-23-temmuz---7-agustos-1919.html The congress managed to draft the first version of the Misak-ı Millî or National Pact.Lewis, p. 248 Before dispersing on 17 August, the congress elected members for a \\"representative committee\\" (heyet-i temsiliye), with Kemal as its head.Zürcher, Eric J. Turkey: A Modern History, 3rd. Ed. London: I.B. Tauris, 2004, p. 150. While the congress was in session, General Kâzım Karabekir was issued a direct order from the Sultanate to place Kemal and Rauf under arrest and assume Kemal's position as Inspector-General of the Eastern Provinces. He defied the government in Constantinople and refused to carry out the arrest.Lewis, p. 248 The conference was held in the building which once housed the Sanasarian College, a prestigious school and erstwhile regional center of Armenian culture and education in the years preceding the Armenian Genocide.Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, pp. 435-436. ==Resolutions== The language of the resolutions was as follows: M. Fahrettin Kırzıoğlu, Bütünüyle Erzurum Kongresi, 1993, p. 131.Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu, History of the Ottoman state, society & civilisation, 2001, p. 827 * The territorial integrity and indivisibility of the homeland must be protected. (Manifesto Art. 6: section regarding Regulations Article 3, Article i of the Regulations and the Manifesto) * The nation would resist foreign occupation and inference. (Articles 2 and 3 of the Regulations ; Articles 3 of the Manifesto.) * A provisional government would be formed if the government in Constantinople is incapable of maintaining the nation's independence and unity. (Regulations Article 4; Manifesto Article 4.) * The aim is to consolidate the national forces into a ruling factor and to establish the will of the nation as the sovereign power. (Article 3 of the Manifesto.) * The nation shall not accept the status of a mandate or a protectorate. (Manifesto Article 7.) ==Impact== The Erzurum Congress was followed by a congress at Sivas attended by delegates from all over the Empire. The Sivas Congress applied the ideas presented at the Erzurum Congress to the whole of Anatolia and Rumelia. The Association for the Defence of the Rights of Eastern Anatolia was changed to the Association for the Defence of the Rights of Anatolia and Rumelia.Lewis, p. 248-249 The Erzurum Congress was the first gathering of Turkish delegates during the Turkish War of Independence which led to the abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate. Although the Sivas congress expressed support for the Sultan, they made it clear that they believed the government and Grand Vezir in Constantinople was incapable of protecting the rights and territory of the Empire's Turkish citizens.Lewis, p. 249 It set the tone of the conflict as one of Turkish nationalism and played a part in defining a new Turkish national identity for the emerging Republic of Turkey. ==Notes== ==See also== * Turkish revolutionaries * Turkish national movement * Turkish War of Independence * Establishment of the Turkish national movement * Chronology of the Turkish War of Independence * Amasya Circular * Sivas Congress Category:Turkish War of Independence Category:History of Erzurum Category:Erzurum Vilayet Category:1919 in the Ottoman Empire Category:1919 conferences ","title":"Erzurum Congress"},{"id":"7821402","text":"Milichiidae are a family of flies. Most species are very small and dark. Details of their biology have not yet been properly studied, but they are best known as kleptoparasites of predatory invertebrates, and accordingly are commonly known as freeloader flies or jackal flies. However, because of the conditions under which many species breed out, they also are known as filth flies. ==Affinities and appearance== The Milichiidae are a family of flies in the suborder Brachycera. They were at one time included in the family Carnidae. At one time or another they have been assigned to various superfamilies, including Carnoidea, Chloropoidea, and Agromyzoidea. As usual for flies of these groups, Milichiidae imagines are tiny, but their heads are comparatively large, compared to many fly species of the same size, such as those in the family Phoridae. Milichiidae are small-to-very-small flies, usually 1 to 3 mm in length. Typically they are black or at least dark. In some species, such as Milichiella argyrogaster, the abdomen of the male is silvery on its dorsal surface because of a covering of fine hairs.Stackelberg, A.A; Acalyptrata, part 1 List of Diptera of the Leningrad Region. III Pages 103–191, 1958. (Reference found on: Brake, I. 2010: Milichiidae online, , accessed 2011.08.13) The eyes of Milichiidae are often red, though this need not be obvious because many species of the flies are small and dusky. Though the proboscis is fairly long in most species, this is not obvious because it commonly is geniculate, having a knee-like fold in the middle that holds it inconspicuously beneath the head when the animal is not feeding. When it is looking for a place to feed on the prey of a spider or the like, the proboscis is extended, giving an impression of licking, as shown in the accompanying video. The abdomen is short and broad; it may be impressively distended after a large meal, as shown in the accompanying photographs. == Biology == Milichiidae attending Rhinocoris bugs mating as the female feeds Neophyllomyza sp. on bee killed by ambush bug The larval stage generally lasts about 2–3 weeks in temperate climates. Larvae primarily feed on rotting vegetable matter or decaying wood or bark and may be reared from manure or decaying plant materials. At least some are coprophagous and feed on human ordure and other detritus, hence the common name \\"filth flies\\". At least some species may breed in dead fish and other carrion, a point of possible interest in forensic entomology. Some species also have been recovered or reared from birds' nests and bat roosts, but reports of parasitism on birds' nestlings by Milichiidae should be interpreted with caution; at one time Milichiidae and Carnidae were not regarded as separate families, and it is not always clear how many of such reports refer to any species other than those that nowadays are included in the Carnidae and separated from the Milichiidae. Human commerce has inadvertently spread some species to all continents but Antarctica. Examples include members of the genera Desmometopa and Milichiella. The adults of some species linger close to invertebrate predators, where they act as kleptoparasites, feeding on bodily fluids of the prey. This strategy has given rise to a range of common names such as freeloader flies and jackal flies. The nature of the kleptoparasitism that Milichiidae practise is difficult to detect from direct observation; some observers remark that they seem to lick the prey rather than anything else. However, it seems that they get whatever nourishment they can; the accompanying photographs suggest that at least some species penetrate the thinnest cuticle of a bee in a spider's jaws, extracting tissues that enzymes in the venom of the spider have reduced to a fluid state.Holm, Erik, Dippenaar-Schoeman, Ansie; Goggo Guide; LAPA publishers (URL: WWW.LAPA.co.za). 2010 When extended, the proboscis certainly is long enough for feeding in such a manner. The \\"jackal\\" habit has been widely documented, with many pictures and references to Millichiidae assembling on the prey of spiders (especially Nephilinae, Oxyopidae, and Thomisidae). They also visit Asilidae, Reduviidae, and even Mantodea. However, a point that is rarely mentioned is that most prey insects do not attract Milichiidae particularly. Instead they seem only to follow the scents exuded by killed prey such as Hemiptera, Heteroptera (stink bugs), and Hymenoptera. This is compatible with the fact that photographs of Milichiidae on prey, almost universally show them on insects that provide such olfactory clues. This would be compatible with the idea that predators that commonly hunt prey that release a dramatic and characteristic olfactory signal, thereby create a niche for suitable kleptoparasites. In at least species that are attracted to prey of Nephilinae in Florida, the major attractants released by Heteropteran prey appear to be low-molecular-weight carbonyl compounds, among which trans-2-hexenal and hexanal are prominent. These compounds are not conspicuous among those released by captured honeybees, so other classes of attractants are likely to be significant as well. In general there is suggestive evidence that the kleptoparasitism relies on olfactory clues; for example, some species seem to operate in the dark, and photographs of approaching flies seem to show them flying upwind, which is consistent with scent following. Xysticus sp. with preyed bee and Desmometopa m-nigrum A notable point is that spiders' meals can have various forms of significance in nature. For one thing, though they may be the most conspicuous of such partakers, the jackal habit is not unique to the Milichiidae, nor do all species in the family necessarily indulge in it, nor for all the same reasons. Certainly careful inspection of photographs of spiders' prey often will show a few specimens from other families of small flies present among the Milichiidae. Examples include Phoridae and Chloropidae. The high frequency of Milichiidae around prey of particular species however, suggests that they are more highly adapted to such activities than most. However, this impression might be regional; reports on field work suggest that in parts of Florida for example, the predominant kleptoparasites were in the family Cecidomyiidae. However, dedicated investigation revealed an impressively wide range of visitors, including Ceratopogonidae and Phoridae. The attraction of the aromas of feeding female spiders, and even of promising sites for female ambushes, also extends to male crab spiders Thomisidae of some species, but in their case the function of the attraction is likely to be reproduction rather than nourishment. Most kleptoparasitic Michiliidae are females, the males presumably having a lower requirement for proteinaceous food; however, as inferred in from the apparent presentation of droplets of food from the proboscises of gorged females, it is possible that the presence of females at the spiders' meals might be reason for males to assemble as well. Another activity observed in some species of Michiliidae, shows them to be serving a function analogous to that of cleaner wrasse and cleaner shrimp; they literally scavenge around the chelicerae and anal openings of large spiders, such as species of Araneus and Nephila, that cooperatively spread their wet and sticky chelicerae thus allowing the flies to feed actively all over the bases, fangs and mouth Some Michiliidae act in various roles as kleptoparasites of various ants. ==Selected genera== Subfamily Madizinae * Aldrichiomyza Hendel, 1914 * Desmometopa Loew, 1866 * Enigmilichia Deeming, 1981 * Leptometopa Becker, 1903 * Madiza Fallén, 1810 * Paramyia Williston, 1897 * Stomosis Melander, 1913 Subfamily Milichiinae * Eusiphona Coquillett, 1897 * Milichia Meigen, 1830 * Milichiella Giglio-Tos, 1895 * Pholeomyia Bilimek, 1867 * Ulia Becker, 1907 Neophyllomyza sp. on bee killed by ambush bug Subfamily Phyllomyzinae * Borneomyia Brake, 2004 * Costalima Sabrosky, 1953 * Microsimus Aldrich, 1926 * Neophyllomyza Melander, 1913 * Paramyioides Papp, 2001 * Phyllomyza Fallén, 1810 *Genus Xenophyllomyza Ozerov, 1992 ==References== == External links == * Milichiidae Online * 'The Scientist' article Category:Brachycera families Category:Carnoidea Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Milichiidae"},{"id":"7821403","text":"Antonello Savelli (c. 1450 - April 1498) was an Italian condottiero. ==Biography== A member of the Roman family of the Savelli, he was the son of Cristoforo Savelli and the uncle of Troilo.

As a player, he was a defender and notably played for Walsall, Hereford United and Mansfield Town. He became manager of Mansfield in 2002, and later Kidderminster Harriers. In 2006, he became assistant manager of Grimsby Town where he remained until 2009 where he then spent three years as a development coach at Hull City. He was briefly appointed assistant manager at Stockport County in 2013. ==Playing career== Watkiss started his playing career at Ward's Bridge School in his hometown of Wolverhampton. He then joined Willenhall Town, for the youth team, which reached the Midland Floodlit Youth League Cup final at Villa Park during the 1982–83 season. He later joined his home town club Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he served his apprenticeship as a 17-year-old. His debut was on 17 March 1984 in a Division One game with Sunderland; however, after making only two appearances, he joined West Midlands (Regional) League side Gresley Rovers in June 1985, before making a move to Crewe Alexandra in January 1986. He went on to play for Rushall Olympic, Walsall, and Hereford United before moving to Mansfield Town in 1996, scoring his only goal for the Stags in a 2–4 win at Darlington in October when he met a Ben Sedgemore cross with a header which bounced downward and up into the top corner of the net. Watkiss remained with Town until hanging his boots up in 1999. ==Management and coaching career== ===Mansfield Town=== Watkiss remained at Mansfield Town as youth team coach taking over from Tony Ford, producing at least ten players who progressed into the first team during his three years in charge of the club's youth set-up. In June 2001, assistant manager Mark Kearney left to join Northampton Town as youth team coach. Speculation mounted that Watkiss would step up to assistant manager. Watkiss told the press \\"I do feel that the job would be a natural progression for me. A lot of the lads who have come up through the club were with me and I would like the chance to work with them again.\\" A few of weeks later, the club's official website revealed that \\"the worst kept secret in the club's history had been confirmed\\", and Watkiss was promoted to assistant manager. Manager Billy Dearden explained, \\"I gave the position a lot of thought and have decided that Stuart is the best man for the job. He is a young coach who could go a long way in the game. He is at the right age to work with me, and it is a huge reward for him. He has done an excellent job with the youth team and it was a huge wrench to take him away from the youth team.\\" Watkiss said \\"I am confident in my ability, I wouldn’t have gone for the job if not. Obviously time will tell if I am a success or not, but I am cautiously optimistic. It will be great working with Bill Dearden. He has a wealth of knowledge and experience within the game and I will be watching and learning all the time.\\" Following the resignation of Billy Dearden to take over at Notts County, Watkiss made the step up from assistant manager at Mansfield Town to become the team's manager in January 2002, where he guided them to their first promotion in 10 years. Due to his promotion success, he was then rewarded a three-year contract, butMansfield struggled in the 2002–03 season and by December 2002, following a 4–2 defeat away to Port Vale, the Stags were bottom of Division Two, Watkiss and assistant Neil Richardson were sacked after a meeting with Mansfield chairman Keith Haslam on the following Monday. ===Kidderminster Harriers=== Watkiss became academy manager at Barnsley in September 2004, before his next port of call to manage Kidderminster Harriers an 18-month contract between 2004 and 2006. ===Grimsby Town=== Following his dismissal he became Assistant Manager to Graham Rodger at Grimsby Town, and took over team affairs briefly in November 2006 following the sacking of Rodger, but he was overlooked for the job, which was given to Alan Buckley instead. Watkiss continued in his role as Assistant Manager for the 2006–07 and 2007–08 campaigns, signing a new one-year contract in June 2007, he said \\"I'm absolutely delighted to be staying and I can't wait for the season to begin, I've learned so much from Alan in such a short time and I have really enjoyed working with him.\\" He was once again given the role of Caretaker Manager Grimsby appointed Mike Newell in October 2008 and Watkiss re-took his former position as Assistant Manager. At the end of the 2008–09 season, Watkiss was relieved of his duties at the club, and replaced by the club's Chief Scout, Brian Stein. ===Hull City=== He was appointed as Development Coach by Phil Brown at Hull City in July 2009. Subsequent to the appointment of Steve Bruce as team manager, on 8 June 2012, Watkiss and fellow first team coach Steve Wigley left the club. ===Stockport County=== On 28 January 2013 Watkiss was appointed assistant manager of Stockport County on an initial three-month deal, working under Darije Kalezić. ===Return to Grimsby Town=== On 11 September 2013 Watkiss rejoined Grimsby Town as the club's new youth team manager following the resignation of Adam Smith. ===Bharat FC=== On 4 November 2014 it was announced that Watkiss would become the first ever head coach of the Bharat FC for the 2014–15 season. ===Third spell with Grimsby=== On 26 October 2016 Watkiss returned to Grimsby on a temporary basis as joint caretaker manager with Dave Moore. Watkiss and Moore oversaw the club's 0-0 draw with Yeovil Town and 1-0 FA Cup defeat to Bolton Wanderers. In January 2017 Watkiss signed for the club on a permanent basis as a Development Coach. ===Naxxar Lions=== In September 2017 Watkiss was appointed manager of Maltese Premier League side Naxxar Lions in Malta. He resigned for personal reasons from the position in November 2017. ==Managerial statistics== { class= style=\\"text-align: center\\" + Managerial record by team and tenure - !rowspan=2Team !rowspan=2From !rowspan=2To !colspan=5Record !rowspan=2 - !!!!!!!!! - align=leftMansfield Town align=left9 January 2002 align=left2 December 2002  - align=leftKidderminster Harriers align=left30 November 2004 align=left1 January 2006  - align=leftGrimsby Town align=left5 March 2018 align=left6 October 2008  - align=leftBharat FC align=left4 November 2014 align=left30 May 2015  - align=leftNaxxar Lions align=left3 September 2017 align=left17 November 2017  - !colspan=3Total !— } ==Honours== ===Club=== Walsall *Division Three second-place promotion: 1994–95 === Manager === Mansfield Town *Division Three third-place promotion: 2001–02 ==ReferencesCategory:Living people Category:1966 births Category:Sportspeople from Wolverhampton Category:Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Gresley F.C. players Category:Crewe Alexandra F.C. players Category:Rushall Olympic F.C. players Category:Walsall F.C. players Category:Hereford United F.C. players Category:Mansfield Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Mansfield Town F.C. managers Category:Kidderminster Harriers F.C. managers Category:Grimsby Town F.C. managers Category:Grimsby Town F.C. non-playing staff Category:Hull City A.F.C. non-playing staff Category:Stockport County F.C. non-playing staff Category:Association football defenders Category:English football managers Category:English footballers ","title":"Stuart Watkiss"},{"id":"7821422","text":"WESE (92.5 FM), known as \\"92.5 The Beat\\", is an Urban Contemporary radio station based in Guntown, Mississippi, United States, and serves Tupelo and Northeast Mississippi with an ERP of 12,000 watts.

It was one of the largest engagements of the Irish Civil War. It consisted of ten days of fighting in the countryside round Kilmallock in County Limerick, in which Irish Free State Army forces, advancing south from Limerick city, found their path blocked by anti-Treaty IRA troops, dug into a number of villages at Bruff, Bruree and Patrickswell. The fighting ended with the retreat of the anti-Treaty fighters and the occupation of Kilmallock by Free State forces. ==Preparations== The prelude to the battle was the fall of Limerick city to Free State forces. The Republican forces in the city under Liam Deasy, withdrew from their positions after a week's fighting and concentrated in Kilmallock and the nearby towns of Bruff and Bruree. The Free State forces, advancing south from the city, found their path blocked by the Republicans dug in at the three hilltop towns. The National Army's attempt to break through this position produced the only 'line battle' of the war with the two sides facing each other along clear front- lines. The Kilmallock-Bruff-Bruree triangle would see some of the war's most intense fighting. Whereas in the fighting in Dublin, Limerick and Waterford, Free State troops equipped with artillery overcame Anti-Treaty resistance relatively easily, at Kilmallock they had a much harder time. The main reason for this was that the Free State troops, most of whom were new recruits, were facing some of the best of the IRA forces without an advantage in numbers or firepower. General Eoin O'Duffy complained of shortage of arms and ammunition. He estimated that while his forces had about 1,300 rifles, the Republicans could muster over 2,000. He was also scathingly critical of the quality of the troops at his disposal, whom he described as, \\"a disgruntled, undisciplined and cowardly crowd\\".Michael Hopkinson, Green against Green, p152 The Republicans knew this and were confident of success. Nevertheless, the Republican commanders had their own problems. Logistical support and co- operation between forces from different counties was poor and unreliable. Deasy's command included Volunteers from Limerick itself, Cork and Kerry, all of whom had their own commanders. They had three improvised armoured cars, some mortars and heavy machine guns but no artillery. O'Duffy drew up plans for the advance on Kilmallock with the assistance of his second-in-command Major General W.R.E. Murphy who had been a Lieutenant Colonel in World War I. His experience in the trenches had a major effect on his approach – pre- disposing him to cautious advances and use of trenches for cover. ==Battle== The Irish Republic had the better of the first clashes. On Sunday 23 July, Free State forces took Bruff and began their advance on Kilmallock, but were twice beaten back by determined Republican resistance. The following day, the Republicans managed to retake Bruff in a counter-attack, taking 76 prisoners. As a result of this setback, O'Duffy called off the advance for the time being and waited for reinforcements. Free State forces quickly retook Bruff after reinforcements arrived. However, things got worse for the National Army as the week went on. They made slow progress in taking the Republican strongpoints, and their casualties also mounted. On Tuesday, 25 July, a unit of the Dublin Guard under Tom Flood was ambushed on a narrow road. They fought their way clear, but only after losing four men killed. Three more Free State soldiers were killed two days later. On 30 July, Major General Murphy launched an attack to take Bruree. The Dublin Guards attacked the town from the southeast, supported by armoured cars and an 18-pound field gun. The Republicans held out for five hours until Free State artillery was brought into action. At least 13 Free State soldiers and nine Anti-Treaty fighters were killed in the action and more were wounded before the Free State troops secured Bruree. The Republican commander Deany knew how important Bruree was to the defence of Kilmallock and drew up plans to recapture the town using three armoured cars, trench mortars and machine guns. On 2 August, Republicans captured Patrickswell south of Limerick. The armoured cars then attacked Bruree, taking Free State forces by complete surprise. One car attacked Commandant Flood's headquarters at the Railway Hotel. The Commandant and his men managed to escape out the back of the building under the cover of Lewis gun fire. The second armoured car rammed the front door of another post in the school house, which persuaded the twenty-five troops inside to surrender. However when Free State reinforcements, along with armoured cars arrived, the republican counter-attack stalled. The Free State reinforcements were led by Comdt. Gen. Seamus Hogan, who personally led his forces, riding in the armoured car nicknamed 'The Customs House.' Having failed to secure the surrender of the town, Republican forces retreated. ==The Tide turns against the Republicans== Having held Bruree against a Republican counterattack, Free State forces prepared to capture Kilmallock itself, but anticipated there would be heavy fighting. Republican Adjutant General Con Moloney commented on 2 August, \\"Up to yesterday we have had the best of the operations there [the Kilmallock area]. There will, I fear, be a big change there now as the enemy have been reinforced very considerably.\\"C Townshend, \\"The Republic: The Fight For Irish Independence\\", p.417. In 3rd Western Division area they had all but disbanded: unwilling to fight Free Staters, destroy roads, and now discouraged by the Catholic church.Adjutant General to Acting Chief of Staff, 29 July 1922, University College Dublin Archives P69/38. On Thursday, 3 August, 2,000 men strong Free State forces backed up by armoured cars and artillery advanced on Kilmallock from Bruree, Dromin and Bulgaden. Seven hundred troops arrived the next day with an armoured car and a field gun. By Saturday the town was surrounded by Free State forces. The Dublin Guard were also on hand to prevent Republican forces from escaping. Three miles away Free State artillery was deployed and shelled Republican forces on Kilmallock Hill and Quarry Hill. The two hills were soon controlled by Free State forces. The National Army had, therefore, assembled overwhelming force to smother resistance at Kilmallock. They were still, however, expecting hard fighting before they took the town. To their surprise, when the Free State troops entered town, they encountered only light resistance from a Republican rearguard (volunteers from Cork). Most of the Republican troops had already abandoned their positions and retreated to Charleville. They had departed not because the Free State troops were much stronger, but because they had been outflanked by Free State seaborne landings on the coasts of County Kerry and County Cork on 2 and 8 August respectively. The landings in Cork and Kerry forced Comdt. Gen. Deasy to release units from this area to return home to their own areas. Although the landings in Cork occurred after the retreat from Kilmallock, the subsequent loss of brigades from Cork added to Commandant General Deasy's problems. The final phase of the fighting in County Limerick came when the Free State advance south was held up at Newcastlewest. Another day of heavy fighting ensued in which the Government troops had to bring up armoured cars and artillery to dislodge the Republicans, who were reported to have lost up to 12 men before they retreated in the direction of Cork. ===Military Analysis=== The Republicans battle plan had not failed due to a lack of armaments, nor in the first instance an unwillingness to fight. However there was in the high command a real inability to accept that the war against the Provisional Government was different from that with the British. Lynch was unprepared to draw up detailed instructions, in spite of urgent requests from O'Malley for orders. Moloney, for example, thought people would see that the National Army was not representing a legitimate Free State. They refused to recognise that the Catholic church were now, having been in favour of resistance against the British, standing for the State and a cessation of war. Men in Limerick and the Western Divisional areas lost the towns, only hanging onto mountainous hills looking west to the sea. Their soldiers refused to fight, went homewards, and would not dig up the roads nor disrupt communication lines. Lynch was frustrated: in his books, O'Malley blamed his lack of control as contrasting with Mulcahy's efficient logistics. In the end the Republicans were outnumbered, and by late 1922 were running low on ammunition, rifles, and explosives, artillery and armoured cars. By contrast the Free State even acquired tanks.C Townshend, \\"The Republic\\", pp.412-421. ===References=== ===Bibliography=== ==External links== *Large article about Irish Civil War Main source for article. *NY Times article, 30 July 1922: 'Stubborn battle goes on around Kilmallock' *NY Times article, 1 August 1922: Free State Troops Capture Tipperary; Close In On Kilmallock, But Defenders Still Occupy dominating Heights *NY Times article, 5 August 1922: 'Irish battle rages around Kilmallock' *NY times article, 6 August 1922: 'Free State forces take Kilmallock' ==See also== *Irish Free State offensive Category:Battles of the Irish Civil War Category:1922 in Ireland Kilmallock Category:National Army (Ireland) Category:July 1922 events Category:August 1922 events ","title":"Battle of Kilmallock"},{"id":"7821571","text":"Thomas Marshal Bibighaus (March 17, 1817 – June 18, 1853) was a Whig member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania.

It was founded in 1981 by guitarist and sole-constant member Akihito Kinoshita, who is responsible for producing, engineering and composing most of the band's work. ==Biography== Saber Tiger was formed in 1981 by guitarist Akihito Kinoshita. After releasing three albums through an independent record label, the band had what appeared to be a temporary break-up. However, Kinoshita worked around this and signed a major label contract with Tokuma Japan Communications. Saber Tiger's 1997 major debut album, Project One, thrust the band to the front of the flourishing Japanese metal scene. The album is essentially a solo album from Kinoshita, with famous guest musicians; vocalist Ron Keel (ex-Steeler and Keel), bassist Naoto Shibata (Anthem), and drummer Hirotsugu Honma (ex-Ezo and Loudness). Saber Tiger then went on to record and release three hit albums (as well as a few others) while officially reformed with Takenori Shimoyama on vocals, Tomohiro Sanpei on bass, and Yoshio Isoda on drums. Working together they produced two more albums, Paragraph 3 and Brain Drain. In 2001, Saber Tiger made their first release under their new major label VAP, naming the album simply Saber Tiger. With VAP they continued on to release F.U.S.E., The History of the New World -凶獣伝説- and the single \\"Eternal Loop\\". Paragraph 3 and The History of the New World -凶獣伝説- were re-recorded compilations of the band's signature songs, with the new line-up and a heavier, more driven sound. They also released a live album named Live 2002 Nostalgia, on both CD and DVD. In 2002, due to different musical ideas and goals, Shimoyama left the band to pursue his own ambitions in the heavy metal music scene. He formed the band Double Dealer, with Norifumi Shima. They signed a European-wide record contract with NTS/Limb Music, traveling through Europe on a tour with Symphony X. After Shimoyama's departure, Saber Tiger continued to write and record new music, producing the album Indignation in 2005, with vocalist Katsuto Suzuki. In 2010, Saber Tiger announced the reunion with former members Takenori Shimoyama (vocals), Yasuharu \\"Machine\\" Tanaka (guitar) and Tomohiro Sampei (bass), and with Yasuhiro Mizuno as their new drummer. Eventually Takanobu Kimoto (ex-Double Dealer and Concerto Moon) replaced Sampei on bass. They began working on a new album at a studio in their hometown of Sapporo. The album Decisive was released on August 3, 2011, and was followed by a tour. On May 26, 2013, they performed at the Pure Rock Japan Live 2013 at Club Citta, alongside NoGoD, Galneryus and Onmyo-Za. Their album Obscure Diversity was mixed and mastered by Simone Mularoni of DGM and released on October 10, 2018.

Playing behind College Hall of Famer Bob Ferguson for two years, and a backfield that included future Pro Football Hall of Famer Paul Warfield and future American Football League legend Matt Snell (AFL), Francis did not break into the starting lineup until his senior year. That year, Ohio State started out as the preseason AP #1 team in the country. Although close losses to UCLA and Northwestern derailed Ohio State's national championship hopes that season, Francis—in a backfield that still included Paul Warfield—led the team in rushing, averaging over 5 yds/carry. In 1962, David was the Big Ten rushing champion (5.2 yds per carry). Francis' greatest achievement as an Ohio State football player was saved for his last game against arch-rival Michigan. Until the 2007 season, his 186-yard, two touchdown performance was the most yards gained by an Ohio State running back against Michigan.(Beanie Wells) Most noteworthy about that performance, is that Francis, under complete exhaustion, collapsed untouched near the goal line in an open field run before he could tally his third touchdown.

Its closest relatives were the Mauritius starling and the hoopoe starling from nearby islands; all three are extinct and appear to be of Southeast Asian origin. The bird was only reported by French sailor Julien Tafforet, who was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. Tafforet observed it on the offshore islet of Île Gombrani. Subfossil remains found on the mainland were described in 1879, and were suggested to belong to the bird mentioned by Tafforet. There was much confusion about the bird and its taxonomic relations throughout the 20th century. The Rodrigues starling was long, and had a stout beak. It was described as having a white body, partially black wings and tail, and a yellow bill and legs. Little is known about its behaviour. Its diet included eggs and dead tortoises, which it processed with its strong bill. Predation by rats introduced to the area was probably responsible for the bird's extinction some time in the 18th century. It first became extinct on mainland Rodrigues, then on Île Gombrani, its last refuge. ==Taxonomy== Turnaround video showing a specimen of the related hoopoe starling, Naturalis Biodiversity Center In 1725, the French sailor Julien Tafforet was marooned on the Mascarene island of Rodrigues for nine months, and his report of his time there was later published as Relation d'île Rodrigue. In the report, he described encounters with various indigenous species, including a white and black bird which fed on eggs and dead tortoises. He stated that it was confined to the offshore islet of Île Gombrani, which was then called au Mât. François Leguat, a Frenchman who was also marooned on Rodrigues from 1691 to 1693 and had written about several species there (his account was published in 1708), did not have a boat, and therefore could not explore the various islets as Tafforet did. No people who later traveled to the island mentioned the bird. In an article written in 1875, the British ornithologist Alfred Newton attempted to identify the bird from Tafforet's description, and hypothesised that it was related to the extinct hoopoe starling (Fregilupus varius), which formerly inhabited nearby Réunion. Subfossil bones of a starling-like bird were first discovered on Rodrigues by the police magistrate George Jenner In 1866 and 1871, and by the reverend Henry Horrocks Slater in 1874. They were found in caves on the Plaine Coral, a limestone plain in south-west Rodrigues.Hume, J. P. (2014). pp. 44–51. These bones included the cranium, mandible, sternum, coracoid, humerus, metacarpus, ulna, femur, tibia, and metatarsus of several birds; the bones were deposited in the British Museum and the Cambridge Museum. In 1879, the bones became the basis of a scientific description of the bird by ornithologists Albert Günther and Edward Newton (the brother of Alfred). They named the bird Necropsar rodericanus; Nekros and psar are Greek for \\"dead\\" and \\"starling\\", while rodericanus refers to the island of Rodrigues. This binomial was originally proposed by Slater in an 1874 manuscript he sent to Günther and Newton. Slater had prepared the manuscript for an 1879 publication, which was never released, but Günther and Newton quoted Slater's unpublished notes in their own 1879 article, and credited him for the name. BirdLife International credits Slater rather than Günther and Newton for the name. Günther and Newton determined that the Rodrigues starling was closely related to the hoopoe starling, and they only kept it in a separate genus due to what they termed \\"present ornithological practice\\". Due to the strongly built bill, they considered the new species likely the same as the bird mentioned in Tafforet's account. In 1900, the English scientist George Ernest Shelley used the spelling Necrospa in a book, thereby creating a junior synonym; he attributed the name to zoologist Philip Sclater. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway suggested that the Rodrigues starling should belong in the same genus as the hoopoe starling, Fregilupus, due to the similarity of the species. More subfossils found in 1974 added support to the claim that the Rodrigues bird was a distinct genus of starling. The stouter bill is mainly what warrants generic separation from Fregilupus. In 2014, the British palaeontologist Julian P. Hume described a new extinct species, the Mauritius starling (Cryptopsar ischyrhynchus), based on subfossils from Mauritius. It was shown to be closer to the Rodrigues starling than to the hoopoe starling, due to the features of its skull, sternum and humerus. Until then, the Rodrigues starling was the only Mascarene passerine bird named from fossil material. Hume noted that Günther and Newton had not designated a holotype specimen among the fossils they based the specific name on, and chose the skull from their syntype series of bones as the lectotype; specimen NMHUK A9050, housed at the Natural History Museum, London. Hume also identified other bones depicted by Günther and Newton among museum collections, and designated them as paralectotypes. 1907 restoration by John Gerrard Keulemans (left), partially based on a specimen that turned out to be an albinistic grey trembler (right) In 1898, the British naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes described a second species of Necropsar, N. leguati, based on a skin in the World Museum Liverpool, specimen D.1792, which was labelled as coming from Madagascar. He suggested that this was the bird mentioned by Tafforet, instead of N. rodericanus from mainland Rodrigues. Walter Rothschild believed the Liverpool specimen to be an albinistic specimen of a Necropsar species supposedly from Mauritius. In 1953, Japanese writer Masauji Hachisuka suggested that N. leguati was distinct enough to warrant its own genus, Orphanopsar. In a 2005 DNA analysis, the specimen was eventually identified as an albinistic specimen of the grey trembler (Cinclocerthia gutturalis) from Martinique. Hachisuka believed the carnivorous habits described by Tafforet to be unlikely for a starling, and thought the lack of a crest suggested that it was not closely related to Fregilupus. He was reminded of corvids because of the black-and- white plumage, and assumed the bird seen by Tafforet was a sort of chough. In 1937, he named it Testudophaga bicolor, with Testudophaga meaning \\"tortoise eater\\", and coined the common name \\"bi-coloured chough\\". Hachisuka's assumptions are disregarded today, and modern ornithologists find Tafforet's bird to be identical to the one described from subfossil remains. In 1987, the British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles prepared a manuscript that described a new species of Old World babbler, Rodriguites microcarina, based on an incomplete sternum found in a cave on Rodrigues. In 1989, the name was mistakenly published before the description, making it a nomen nudum. Later examination of the sternum by Hume showed that Rodriguites microcarina was identical to the Rodrigues starling. ===Evolution=== In 1943, the American ornithologist Dean Amadon suggested that Sturnus-like species could have arrived in Africa, and given rise to the wattled starling (Creatophora cinerea) and the Mascarene starlings. According to Amadon, the Rodrigues and hoopoe starlings were related to Asiatic starlings, such as some species of Sturnus, rather than the glossy starlings (Lamprotornis) of Africa and the Madagascan starling (Saroglossa aurata); he concluded this based on the colouration of the birds. A 2008 study, which analysed the DNA of various starlings, confirmed that the hoopoe starling was a starling, but with no close relatives among the sampled species. Extant East Asian starlings, such as the Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi) and the white-headed starling (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities with these extinct species in colouration and other features. As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem to be more closely related to each other than to the hoopoe starling, which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian starlings, there may have been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings. This is probably due to the isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands. ==Description== Hypothetical restoration, based on Tafforet's account, subfossils, and related species The Rodrigues starling was large for a starling, being in length. Its body was white or greyish white, with blackish-brown wings, and a yellow bill and legs. Tafforet's complete description of the bird reads as follows: Tafforet was familiar with the fauna of Réunion, where the related hoopoe starling lived. He made several comparisons between the faunas of different locations, so the fact that he did not mention a crest on the Rodrigues starling indicates that it was absent. His description of their colouration is similar. Skull and temporomandibular joint Hume notes that the skull of the Rodrigues starling was about the same size as that of the hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The maxilla of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible. Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was sexually dimorphic. Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but this may be due to individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism. Günther and Newton noted that the skull of the Rodrigues starling was shaped somewhat differently and longer than that of the hoopoe starling, being about long from the occipital condyle; it was also narrower, being wide. The eyes were set slightly lower, and the upper rims of the eye sockets were about apart. The interorbital septum was more delicate, with a larger hole in its centre. The bill was about long, less curved and proportionally a little deeper than in the hoopoe starling. It also seems to have had larger nostrils, with the nostril openings in the bone being in length. The mandible was about long and deep proximally. The skull had an attachment scar above the temporal fossa. The supraoccipital ridge on the skull was quite strongly developed, and a biventer muscle attachment in the parietal region below it was conspicuous. This indicates that the starling had strong neck and jaw muscles. According to Günther and Newton, the ulna of the Rodrigues starling was somewhat shorter than that of the hoopoe starling, measuring ; the humerus measured , and the keel on its sternum was a bit lower. It had strong quill knobs on the ulna, indicating that the secondary remiges were well developed. One coracoid measured in length, and one carpometacarpus was long. The leg and feet had the same proportions. The femur measured around , the tibiotarsus , and the tarsometatarsus . ==Behaviour and ecology== alt=Drawing of houses on Rodrigues Little is known about the behaviour of the Rodrigues starling, apart from Tafforet's description, from which various inferences can be made. The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability to gape indicates that it foraged on the ground. Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items. Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct Cylindraspis land tortoises, as well as marine turtles, which would have provided a large amount of food for the starling, particularly during the breeding seasons. Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the starling may have also done this. Originally, the Rodrigues starling may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. Tafforet's description also indicates that it had a complex song. alt=Map of Rodrigues, decorated with Solitaires The stouter build and more bent shape of the mandible suggest that the Rodrigues starling used greater force than the hoopoe starling when searching and perhaps digging for food. It probably also had the ability to remove objects and forcefully open entrances when searching for food; it did this by inserting its wedge-shaped bill and opening its mandibles, as other starlings and crows do. This ability supports Tafforet's observation that the bird fed on eggs and dead tortoises. It could have torn dead, presumably juvenile, turtles and tortoises out of their shells. Tafforet did not see any Rodrigues starlings on the mainland, but he stated that they could easily be reared by feeding them meat, which indicates that he brought young birds from a breeding population on Île Gombrani. Tafforet was marooned on Rodrigues during the summer and was apparently able to procure juvenile individuals; some other Rodrigues birds are known to breed at this time, so it is likely that the starling did the same. Many other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem is now heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests completely covered the island, but very little remains today. The Rodrigues starling lived alongside other recently extinct birds, such as the Rodrigues solitaire, the Rodrigues parrot, Newton's parakeet, the Rodrigues rail, the Rodrigues owl, the Rodrigues night heron, and the Rodrigues pigeon. Extinct reptiles include the domed Rodrigues giant tortoise, the saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise, and the Rodrigues day gecko. ==Extinction== Leguat mentioned that pigeons only bred on islets off Rodrigues, due to predation from rats on the mainland. This may be the reason why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have either been absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. Rats - constituting an Invasive species - could have arrived in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. The islets would have been the last refuge for the bird, until the rats colonised them, too. The Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist Alexandre Guy Pingré visited Rodrigues during the French 1761 Transit of Venus expedition. The large populations of tortoises and marine turtles on Rodrigues resulted in the export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are adept at crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. At least five species of Aplonis starlings have become extinct in islands of the Pacific Ocean, and rats also contributed to their demise.Hume, J. P.

The first catalogue to be produced in the name of Screwfix Direct appeared in 1992, and, with a turnover of £4 million, the company moved into larger premises at Pen Mill, Yeovil, in 1994. This was to herald the start of significant growth, in 1998, with a turnover that had virtually doubled year on year to £28 million, the company moved to a purpose built site at Houndstone Business Park in Yeovil. The first website was launched in February 1999, just five months prior to the company being acquired by Kingfisher plc. Later that year, the company expanded its site in Houndstone, with the opening of a new contact centre employing five hundred people. In January 2000, Screwfix announced a turnover of £58 million, and trading hours were extended to seven days a week. In January 2001, turnover first exceeded £100 million, and after further expansion in the contact centre, Screwfix announced sales of £185 million in 2002. The thousandth employee joined the organisation in March 2000, and a month later. next day deliveries within mainland United Kingdom were introduced. The company relaunched the website later that year, and was awarded Retailer Of the Year. In September 2004, to continue to meet the increased demand, a fully automated, 325,000 sq ft distribution centre was opened in Trentham, Stoke on Trent, fulfilling next day orders. The Screwfix Community, an online forum, was also launched later that year. In 2008, there was the launch of Plumbfix, offering qualified plumbers a wider range of specialist goods at better prices, this was followed by the launch of Electricfix the next year. In July 2011, Screwfix launched its \\"Click & Collect\\" service, which enables customers to order and pay securely online, and collect in store in as little as one minute.

Licensed to Tupelo, Mississippi, United States, the station serves the Tupelo area. The station is currently owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., through licensee Capstar TX LLC. ==History== WTUP was the second broadcast radio station in Tupelo, Mississippi (the first was WELO). The station signed on as a full-service AM providing music, news and weather for Tupelo. WTUP originally broadcast with 1,000 watts at 1380 on the dial, only during the daytime. About 1959, when WELO vacated 1490 to switch to 580, WTUP switched to the 1490, in order to broadcast 24 hours. WTUP switched to a full-time contemporary Top 40 music format in about 1958 and was very successful with the younger audience, competing with WELO and its full-service format. In 1956, when hometown phenom Elvis Presley returned to Tupelo to perform at the annual Mississippi-Alabama Fair & Dairy Show, Jim Reese (who was the general manager of WTUP) was the MC for the concerts. WTUP employees Charlie Watts and Ron Brandon were responsible for recording interviews with Elvis, actor Nick Adams, and Elvis' parents, as well as recording both the afternoon and evening concerts. A tape of the interviews and concerts was found at Graceland in Memphis after Elvis's death, and later released to the public by RCA on what would have been Elvis' 50th birthday. At one time, WTUP and WELO were sister stations. The station participates in Tupelo's annual Race For The Cure fundraising marathon for the American Cancer Society. WTUP changed formats a few times, eventually being purchased by Clear Channel Communications and 'flipped' to a sports radio format. The station broadcast professional sports teams like the St. Louis Cardinals and the Memphis Grizzlies in addition to local sports institutions such as Saltillo High School football, Tupelo High School basketball and baseball, and Mississippi Mudcats arena football. At one point, WTUP was broadcasting more than 200 live, local sports events annually. In 2009, following a purchase of the radio station by URBan Radio Broadcasting, WTUP returned to an oldies music format and resumed \\"The Top Dawg\\" branding. In July 2016, WTUP changed their format to a simulcast of classic hits-formatted WBVV 99.3 FM Tupelo. On August 13, 2018, WTUP dropped the simulcast and flipped to alternative rock as \\"Alt 107.7\\", utilizing a new FM simulcast on translator W299CS 107.7 FM Tupelo.

He has sought to reconstitute the epistemology of the humanities and social sciences, paying close attention to the interaction of will, imagination and reason. He has criticized abstract, ahistorical conceptions of rationality as inadequate to the study of distinctively human life and to the study of real universality. He has argued that there is a much different, experientially grounded form of rationality, the reason of philosophy proper, that is capable of at once humble and penetrating observation. He has developed a philosophy known as value-centered historicism, which demonstrates the potential union of universality and historical particularity. In political theory he has been a sharp critic of Straussian anti-historical thinking and so-called neoconservatism. He has argued that in essential ways neoconservatism resembles the ideology of the French Jacobins and is neo-Jacobin.Which American? (Claes G. Ryn) How Conservatives Failed The Culture (Claes G. Ryn)Personalism and Value-Centered Historicism( Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois) Ryn's discussion of democracy emphasizes that popular government can assume radically different forms, only some of which are compatible with a higher, ethical striving. Theories of what he calls plebiscitary democracy assume romantic and utopian notions of human nature and society. Constitutional democracy is based on a more realistic view of man and is more consonant with the actual moral terms of human existence. This form of government has demanding moral and cultural preconditions and is endangered wherever those preconditions are not satisfied. Ryn has developed a philosophy of civilization and international relations that emphasizes the moral and cultural preconditions of good relations among persons, peoples, and civilizations. It addresses the problem of multiculturalism that has been made acute by globalization. He argues that diversity need not be a source of strife but can even foster mutually enriching interactions, provided that persons, peoples, and civilizations let their distinctiveness be informed by sensitivity to what is highest in each. The way to avoid conflict is not for persons and societies to shed all traits that make them different from others and adopt a homogenous uni-culture, but for each to cultivate the best that it has to offer. In this manner universality and particularity can not merely co- exist, but enter into an enriching dynamic. They can, each in their own way, contribute to an evolving common human ground in which universality and particularity are brought together. In 2000 he gave the Distinguished Foreign Scholar Lectures at Beijing University, which also published this lecture series in Chinese translation as a book, Unity Through Diversity (2001).

In 1912 he was sent to Libya as a Captain with the 8th Artillery Regiment and the following year was decorated for military valor at the action at Safsaf. He fought in the First World War and ended the conflict as a Lieutenant Colonel. From 1924-1928, he was the military representative of the Italian Regio Esercito (Royal Army) in Paris. In 1928, Nasi was sent to the Italian colonies as Chief-of-Staff for the Colonial Troops and was Vice-Governor of Cyrenaica in 1934-1935, Governor of Harar from 1936–1939, and Governor of Shewa in 1939-1940. He also served as a Vice-Governor of Italian East Africa from 1939. Nasi promoted a moral reformation of the military and civil administration and he showed notable skills in dealing with indigenous chiefs. In April 1936, during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, Nasi commanded the left column of three columns during Generale Rodolfo Graziani′s advance on the southern front. Most of Nasi's troops were Libyans. After the beginning of World War II, Nasi led the Italian conquest of British Somaliland in August 1940. He successfully invaded British Somaliland and, with the advantage of air cover and tanks, forced the defending British and Commonwealth forces to evacuate by sea to Aden after defeating the main body of their army at the Battle of Tug Argan from 11-15 August. In early 1941, during the British counter-offensive, Nasi was forced to retreat to the stronghold of Gondar. During the East African Campaign, Nasi led the last stand of an Italian garrison in East Africa. On 6 July, after Duke Amedeo of Aosta and Generale Pietro Gazzera surrendered, Nasi became the acting Governor-General of Italian East Africa. While he held out long after other Italian strongholds had fallen, Nasi finally surrendered his stronghold of Gondar on 28 November 1941. Nasi was sent to Kenya as a prisoner of war. After the death of Duke Amedeo, he was responsible for the 60,000 Italian prisoners kept there. Nasi returned to Italy in 1945. Four years later, he was appointed as Commissar for Somalia when the latter was assigned to United Nations suzerainty. Nasi died at Modena in 1971. ==Aftermath== Although Nasi was listed as a war criminal by the post-war Ethiopian government, Italian historian Angelo Del Boca, usually very severe in judging the behaviour of Italian army in the colonies, considers him the best officer of the Italian Royal Army (Regio Esercito) in East Africa. Solomon Getahun supports this view of Nasi, noting that his behavior towards the inhabitants of Gondar and the adjoining territories helped him to sustain the fight against both British and Ethiopian forces as long as he did.Solomon Getamun, History of the City of Gondar (Africa World Press, 2005), pp. 38f Near Gondar a mount is still named Mount Nasi. ==See also== * Second Italo-Abyssinian War * East African Campaign (World War II) * Italian conquest of British Somaliland * Battle of Gondar ==References== Category:1879 births Category:1971 deaths Category:People from Civitavecchia Category:Italian generals Category:Italian diplomats Category:Italian military personnel of World War II Category:Italian military personnel of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War Category:People of former Italian colonies Category:Italian East Africa Category:Italian prisoners of war Category:Grand Officers of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus Category:Grand Officers of the Military Order of Savoy Category:Knights of the Order of Vittorio Veneto Category:Recipients of the Silver Medal of Military Valor Category:Recipients of the Maurician medal Category:Recipients of the War Merit Cross (Italy) Category:Governors of British Somaliland ","title":"Guglielmo Nasi"},{"id":"7821802","text":"The Royal Italian Army, also known as the Regio Esercito, was established during the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy. During the 1800s Italy started to unify into one country and in 1861, Manfredo Fanti signed a creation decree which created the Army of the Two Sicilies. This newly created army first task was to defend against the repressive power in southern Italy. The Army of Two Sicilies combated against criminals and other armies during this time of unification. After the monarchy ended, the army changed its name to become the Italian Army (Esercito Italiano). Within the Italian Royal Army are the elite mountain military corporals called, the Alpini. The Alpini are the oldest active mountain infantry in the world. Their original mission was to protect and secure Italy's northern mountain border that aligns with France and Austria. This group emerged in World War I when a three-year campaign was fought against the Austro-Hungarian Kaiserjager and the German Alpenkorps. Again in World War II the Alpini fought alongside Axis forces in the Eastern Front as well as the Balkans Campaigns. ==History== ===Origins=== The Regio Esercito dates from the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, following the unification of Italy in 1861 after the Papal States were seized. On 4 May 1861, Manfredo Fanti signed the creation decree, by which the new army was to replace the previous Royal Sardinian Army and the Army of the Two Sicilies. The first two tasks of the new organization were the repression of brigandage in southern Italy against irregular and hit and run forces (mixed with bands of various criminals), who refused to accept the suppression of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, and the Third War of Italian Independence. On 20 September 1870, the IV Corps captured Rome, which had remained under Papal control up until then. On 8 February 1885, a corps of fewer than 1,000 soldiers landed at Massaua, Eritrea, starting the creation of an Italian colonial empire. The Italian advance was halted at the Battle of Adwa by overwhelming Ethiopian forces. The following year, as part of the Italian collaboration with the international pacification program after the revolt against the Turkish domination in Cyprus, another corps disembarked at Candia. On 14 July 1900, another expeditionary force was constituted to suppress the Boxer Rebellion in China in defense of the European protectorates. On 3 October 1911, Italy invaded Libya as part of the Italo-Turkish War. The war against the Ottoman Empire ended with the signing of the First Treaty of Lausanne in Ouchy, near Lausanne, Switzerland.Treaty of Peace Between Italy and Turkey The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 7, No. 1, Supplement: Official Documents (Jan., 1913), pp. 58-62 === Military Justice in the Royal Italian Army === In the Italian Royal Army, military justice was applied on the based on the 1870 Military Penal Code regulations. This regulation structure was very similar to the 1859 version which was inspired by the Sardinian military penal code of 1840 which preceded the Albertine Statute of 1848. These regulations and factors were determined to be inadequate in the face of direct war violence. In total, 4,028 death sentences were passed in the Royal Italian Army whereas 2,967 were issued absentia where 750 were followed through and completed and 311 were not. === World War I === The Royal Italian Army's first experience with modern warfare was in World War I, from 1915-1918\\\\. The war was fought mostly on the Italian Front in Northern Italy, costing the Italian Army serious casualties, including about 600,000 dead. The Italian 35th Division served on the Macedonian Front as part of the Allied Army of the Orient. === Interwar period === During the Interwar period, the army participated in the final subjugation of Libya, participated in the invasion of Ethiopia, provided troops and materials for the Corps of Volunteer Troops (Corpo Truppe Volontarie) to fight in the Spanish Civil War, and participated in the Italian invasion of Albania. ===World War II=== The Regio Esercito (Royal Army) was one of the largest ground forces in World War II, during which it was one of the pioneers of the use of paratroopers. Many Italian divisions were reinforced by a MVSN Gruppo di Assalto of two battalions due to the small size of the divisions. In 1943, Italy surrendered and split into the Italian Social Republic, which fielded its own army, the Esercito Nazionale Repubblicano (National Republican Army). On the other side was the Esercito Cobelligerante del Sud (Italian Co-Belligerent Army), the army of the Italian Royalist forces, fighting on the side of the Allies in southern Italy after the Allied armistice with Italy in September 1943. The Kingdom was ultimately replaced by the Italian Republic in 1946, and the Royal Army accordingly changed its name to become the Esercito Italiano (Italian Army). ==== The Invasion of Cos==== On 3 October 1943, German Naval vessels traveling the Aegean Sea were spotted by Italian lookouts along the northern coast. They alerted island command but the command was not alarmed because they had been notified by British surveillance who assured them the Germans had inadequate ships to complete a seaborn invasion. They also began to make excuses that the ships could be British transporting materials and reinforcements to the units already on the island. While all the discussion occurred at the command post, three German units were invading the island. Within hours, German troops had slain the advanced Italian defense militia. There were 148 Italian soldiers and officers in Cos on the date of the attack. Many were killed during the initial attack, while others died in hospital or later in German prisons. === Timeline of history === * 1861-The Regio Esercito dates from the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, following the unification of Italy in 1861 after the Papal States were seized.

They were the first football team to play their games at Springfield Park and would be followed by Wigan United, Wigan Town, Wigan Borough and Wigan Athletic. ==Wigan County (1897–1900)== Wigan County were formed in May 1897,Wigan Football Roots, This Northern Soul. Accessed 9 January 2012. and were accepted into the Lancashire League. The club pulled off something of a coup, signing former Everton goalkeeper Robert Menham, and announced their ambitions to play in the Football League. The first match was played on 25 August 1897, with the club letting the supporters in for free, the intention being to raise the club's profile. The second game was played in atrocious weather conditions, but still attracted a crowd of over 3,000. The first recorded game was on Wednesday, 1 September 1897, at Springfield Park. About 1,500 people braved the awful conditions that had persisted in Wigan for the last month or so, to see County draw 1–1 with Burton Swifts in a friendly game. The club's first Lancashire League game was against Southport Central, on 11 September 1897, a game in which they won 5–1 in front of a crowd of 4000. Paddy Gordon scored County's first League goal during the first half of this match.Wigan Examiner 18.9.1897 page3, columns 3 & 4 Admission prices were considered to be steep, costing 4d and 8d. County made a bid to join the football league in 1898, not expecting to be accepted. They were not, but they managed to receive seven votes whereas Coventry City, a club much bigger than County, received none. ==County and the Cups== In County's first F.A. Cup run, they qualified for the first round proper by beating Fleetwood Rangers 1–0, Hurst Ramblers 4–3, Blackburn Park Road 2–1 and Nelson 3–1. In the fifth qualifying round they played Division 2 Darwen, drawing 1–1. They won the replay on 15 December 1897 by four goals to nil. County drew Manchester City, who at the time played in the old Football League Division Two, at Ardwick. The game took place on 29 January 1898Match report, Wigan Examiner 2 February 1898 page 4, columns 2&3 and Manchester City won 1–0, courtesy of a goalkeeping error. Playing for County that day was Jack Gordon, who scored the first ever football league goal for Preston North End against Burnley in 1888. He also played in the match that saw the highest recorded number of goals in an F.A cup game, as Preston North End dispatched Hyde United 26–0 in 1887. County's first Lancashire cup game was against Bacup in October 1897, which County won 1–0. In the next round in December 1897, County played Newton Heath (later to become Manchester United). After eighty- three minutes, the game was stopped due to bad light, with County losing 6–0. The club attempted to get the result overturned, but the Lancashire F.A ruled that the result would stand. In the 1898/99 season, County won Wigan's first ever trophy, the Rawclife Charity Cup; Wigan beat St. Helens Recreation 2–0 at Dole Lane, Chorley in front of 6,000 spectators. Later the club paraded the trophy around Wigan in a wagonette, accompanied by a brass band. ==The demise of Wigan County== On 13 September 1899, George Wilcock offered Springfield Park up for auction at the venue where the ground was born – The Ship Hotel. The ground covered almost of land and contained a 'half mile cinder trotting track', an 'excellent cinder pedestrian track', a 'grand cement cycling track' and a 'splendid football ground, with a grandstand, entrance turnstiles and refreshment bars'. Bids started at £4,500 and the ground was eventually sold for £6000 to a Wigan syndicate, who then sold it to the Royal London Friendly Society for the same amount. It was also revealed that County had a contract to play there until 30 April 1900, although financial problems forced the club to leave at the end of March. The final four 'home' games were played at The Anchor Ground at Darwen, Green Lane at Stockport and two at the Recreation Ground, Ashton-in-Makerfield. In October 1899, there was a meeting of all local football clubs to discuss if there were any means of helping County, whose squad was restricted to only thirteen players. Thirty clubs attended the meeting and all agreed that the County could have the best of local talent. In return County provided the amateur clubs with a qualified instructor, to help them improve. Two months later, the club was rumoured to be closed, this was not yet the case. However, after poor results and falling attendances, the club agreed to fulfil all its fixtures before folding on 29 June 1900. ==Notable players== * John Cunningham * Andy Gara * John Grundy ==References== Category:Defunct football clubs in England Category:Association football clubs established in 1897 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 1900 Category:Sport in Wigan Category:1897 establishments in England Category:1900 disestablishments in England Category:Lancashire League (football) Category:Defunct football clubs in Lancashire ","title":"Wigan County F.C."},{"id":"7821864","text":"John Blanchard (September 30, 1787 – March 9, 1849) was a Whig member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania.

The Population of Native California refers to the population of Indigenous peoples of California. Estimates prior to and after European contact have varied substantially. Pre- contact estimates range from 133,000 to 705,000 with some recent scholars concluding that these estimates are low. Following the arrival of Europeans in California, disease and violence reduced the population to as low as 25,000. During and after the California Gold Rush, it is estimated that miners and others killed about 4,500 Indigenous people of California between 1849 and 1870. As of 2005, California is the state with the largest self-identified Native American population according to the U.S. Census at 696,600. == Pre- contact estimates == A territorial map of California tribal groups and languages prior to European contact Historians have calculated the Native Californian population prior to European entry into the region using a number of different methods, including: * Mission records (births, baptisms, deaths, and total numbers of neophytes at particular periods); * Counting villages identified from historic, ethnographic, or archaeological records, multiplied by estimates of the average number of inhabitants per village; * Ecological estimates of the regional human carrying capacity, given aboriginal technologies and economies; * Population density extrapolations from better- documented regions to less well known ones; and * Extrapolating from historic censuses, using estimated rates of population decrease. Few analysts claim that these methods yield accurate numbers. The estimates developed by different analysts commonly vary by a factor of two or more. Stephen Powers initially estimated that the pre-contact population of the state was 1,520,000. He later reduced this figure to 705,000. C. Hart Merriam offered the first detailed analysis. He based his estimates on mission records and extrapolated that to non-missionized areas. His estimate for the state as a whole was 260,000. Alfred L. Kroeber made a detailed re-analysis, both for the state as a whole and for the individual ethnolinguistic groups within it. He reduced Merriam's figure by about half, to 133,000 Native Californians in 1770. Martin A. Baumhoff used an ecological basis to evaluate the potential carrying capacity and estimated an aboriginal population of 350,000. Sherburne F. Cook was the most persistent and painstaking student of the problem, examining in detail both pre-contact estimates and the history of demographic decline during mission and post-mission periods. Initially, in 1943, Cook arrived at a figure only 7% higher than the one previously suggested by Kroeber: 133,550 (excluding the Modoc, Northern Paiute, Washoe, Owens Valley Paiute, and Colorado River Yumans). Cook later raised his estimate to 310,000. Some scholars now believe that waves of epidemic diseases reached California well in advance of the arrival of the Franciscans in 1769. If correct, this may imply that population estimates using the beginning of the mission period as a baseline have substantially underestimated the state's pre-Columbian population. == California statehood and genocide == Mexican sovereignty over Alta California was short lived, as after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed to end the Mexican–American War in 1848, the U.S. took control of California and passed the California Statehood Act on September 9, 1850. In the latter half of the 19th century both State and Federal authorities, incitedOn January 6, 1851 at his State of the State address to the California Senate, 1st Governor Peter Burnett used the following words: \\"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct must be expected.

He predicted the total extermination of the Digger Indians of California and the tribes of other States, within ten years, if something were not done for their relief. The lecturer concluded by strongly urging the establishment of a Protective Aborigines Society, something similar to the society in England to prevent cruelty to animals. By this means he thought the condition of the Indian might be improved and the race longer perpetuated'. The British Medical Journal, Vol. 1, No. 274 (Mar. 31, 1866), p. 350 A notable early eyewitness testimony and account: \\"The Indians of California\\" 1864, is from John Ross Browne, Custom's official and Inspector of Indian Affairs on the Pacific Coast systematically categorizing the fraud, corruption, land theft, slavery, rape and massacre perpetrated on a substantial portion of the aboriginal population. By one estimate, at least 4,500 California Indians were killed between 1849 and 1870. Historian Benjamin Madley recorded the numbers of killings of California Indians between 1846 and 1873 and estimated that during this period at least 9,400 to 16,000 California Indians were killed by non- Indians, mostly occurring in more than 370 massacres (defined as the \\"intentional killing of five or more disarmed combatants or largely unarmed noncombatants, including women, children, and prisoners, whether in the context of a battle or otherwise\\").Madley, Benjamin, An American Genocide, The United States and the California Catastrophe, 1846–1873, Yale University Press, 2016, 692 pages, , p.11, p.351 Professor Ed Castillo, of Sonoma State University, provides a higher estimate: \\"The handiwork of these well armed death squads combined with the widespread random killing of Indians by individual miners resulted in the death of 100,000 Indians in the first two years of the gold rush.\\" == Post-contact changes == The decline of Native Californian populations during the late 18th and 19th centuries was investigated in detail by Cook. Cook assessed the relative importance of the various sources of the decline, including Old World epidemic diseases, violence, nutritional changes, and cultural shock. Declines tended to be steepest in the areas directly affected by the missions and the Gold Rush. Other studies have addressed the changes that occurred within individual regions or ethnolinguistic groups. The Native Californian population reached its nadir of around 25,000 at the end of the 19th century. Based on Kroeber's estimate of 133,000 people in 1770, this represents a more than 80% decrease. Using Cook's revised figure, it constitutes a decline of more than 90%. On this Cook rendered his harshest criticism: The population subsequently rose substantially throughout the 20th century. This recovery may represent both true demographic growth and changing patterns in ethnic self-description. In the 21st century, after more than eight generations of close interaction between Native Californians and individuals of European, Asian, African, and other Native American descent, there can be little objective basis for quantifying the Native Californian component within the state's population. However, reservation rolls and census self-descriptions provide some information. == See also == * Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas * Mission Indians * California mission clash of cultures * California Genocide == Notes == == References == Population Category:Native American tribes in California Population Population Category:Native American genocide * Category:Pre-statehood history of California Category:The Californias Category:European colonization of the Americas ","title":"Population of Native California"},{"id":"7821918","text":"In intertidal reef-flat environments, massive Porites form characteristic microatoll formations, with living coral around the perimeter and dead skeleton on the exposed upper surface.van Woesik, R., Golbuu, Y. and Roff, G. (2015) \\"Keep up or drown: adjustment of western Pacific coral reefs to sea level rise in the 21st century\\". Royal Society, open science, 2 (7): 150181. A microatoll is a circular colony of coral, dead on the top but living around the perimeter. Growth is mainly lateral, as upward growth is limited by exposure to air. Microatolls may be up to in diameter. They are named for their resemblance to island atolls formed during the subsidence of volcanic islands, as originally suggested by Darwin (1842). They act as natural recorders of sea level, which allows the monitoring of sea level changes in response to global warming. They have also been used to quantify and date changes in relative sea level in seismically active areas, and to provide information on changes in sea surface temperature using oxygen isotope values as a proxy. ==Terminology== The term 'microatoll' was first used by Krempf in 1927, although his description lacks a precise definition. Kuenen defined it in 1933 as \\"a colony of corals\\" with \\"a raised rim, more or less completely surrounding a lower, dead surface\\". This definition has been extended to include similar structures built by non-coral reef-building organisms such as serpulid worms, pelecypods and vermetid gastropods. ==Occurrence== Microatolls are found only in corals that grow in the lower intertidal zone on shallow reef flats. Microatolls are formed by several species of the genus Porites, but examples have also been described from Acropora, Heliopora, Favia, Favites, Platygyra, Cyphastrea and Goniastrea. ==In climate research== ===Paleogeodesy=== The detailed record of sea level change preserved in fossil microatolls, combined with precise dating of individual annual rings using the Uranium-thorium dating method, allows them to be used to determine past relative sea-level change with uncertainties of about in level and a few years to a few decades in time. They have been used to map the rupture areas of great to giant earthquakes and to estimate the recurrence interval of such events before historic records are available. ===Sea surface temperatures=== Changes in oxygen isotope ratios in fossil microatolls have also been used to provide high-resolution proxy records for sea surface temperature over the last few thousand years. ==See also== * 1833 Sumatra earthquake ==References== Category:Coral reefs ","title":"Microatoll"},{"id":"7821929","text":"A microearthquake (or microquake) is a very low intensity earthquake which is 2.0 or less in magnitude.

They normally cause no damage to life or property, and are very rarely felt by people. Microquakes occur often near volcanoes as they approach an eruption, and frequently in certain regions exploited for geothermal energy , such as near Geyserville in Northern California.

While trying to move him, they hear an expulsion of flatulence, which they think at first was from one of the firefighters. This leads them to believe he might not be dead. On double checking his vital signs they find he is alive, but in a coma. Cuddy brings his file to the team's attention for a consult, only to find House has not yet come in to work. Initial differential diagnosis says that despite weighing more than 600 pounds, the patient is relatively healthy, with no diabetes mellitus or high cholesterol - which are not normal symptoms for a man of his size. We discover that House is still in jail, from his arrest in the previous episode \\"Fools for Love\\", by Detective Tritter, a cop who was angered by House's anti-social behavior and prank. House asks to be arraigned or released and Tritter asks him which he'd prefer. Dr. House is arraigned (presumably because he refused to apologize), and is released on bail, with Wilson providing the $15,000 bond. Wilson advises House to get a lawyer, to which he replies \\"I already have one\\". Wilson takes this to mean he'll represent himself, and advises him against it. While the team is talking about House's absence, he arrives in the room. The initial differential diagnosis draws a blank, and Dr. House suggests getting a full medical history and checking out his home looking for environmental stimuli that might have caused his condition. Cameron does, and notices how the apartment and lifestyle of the patient (George) is similar to that of House. She talks to a neighbor who says he also has prostitutes visit his apartment. House then does his clinic duty, where he meets a man who wakes with a pain in his arm every time he sleeps on it. After asking him to alter his sleep behavior, which the patient refuses to do, House sarcastically offers to have his arm removed. The patient then storms out of the examination room. House also leaves the room and is confronted by Detective Tritter where they have another verbal altercation. The team then attempts another differential diagnosis with the initial assumption of syphilis. House dismisses this saying the problem has to do with his weight. House suggests checking his brain for clots. When the team suggests he is too heavy for both the MRI and CT scanner, he suggests skipping it and going for treatment (blood thinners). Despite this, Foreman and Cameron attempt to give him an MRI. Cuddy goes to House with the name of a lawyer. During the scan, the patient starts choking and moving as he awakes from his coma, breaking the MRI machine. The team conducts another differential diagnosis when Cuddy storms in accusing House of breaking the newly repaired MRI machine. House proclaims his innocence, and Cameron says it was her idea, citing the possible lawsuit the hospital would have faced if the hospital did not treat him properly because of his weight, which is a legally registered disability. During the differential diagnosis, Foreman suggests the problem is hormonal while Cameron suggests the problem is STD-related. House says to check him for both, while he tells Chase to \\"sit on your ass,\\" as he had said it was a hematoma that would go away on its own. Foreman and Cameron talk to the patient who says he has been tested for hormonal imbalances and diabetes before, although he claims to have had nystagmus, an eye disorder, from birth. The patient claims to be better and wants to go home. The doctors advise against this, citing the seriousness of him previously falling into a coma. The patient then cites the number of fatalities that are caused by hospital- borne infections. House is talking to Wilson when Foreman and Cameron approach him citing all the tests were normal. House visits the patient, when he receives an alarming phone call. He rushes back to his apartment, which has been ransacked. He then finds Detective Tritter who was executing a search warrant of the apartment. Tritter finds hundreds of Vicodin tablets, saying that the sheer number of pills could appear to be evidence to a DA of intent to traffic. House goes back to the hospital where he orders his team to discharge the patient. He confronts Wilson thinking he talked to the cop, which Wilson denies and tells him to visit his lawyer. The patient is discharged and tries to leave but becomes disoriented, and falls through a glass window, taking Cameron with him. Re-admitted, it transpires that Cameron gave him phenytoin which caused the fall, saying she did not think he should leave the hospital. It is revealed that the patient skipped a meal which leads House to think it could be a parasite causing the loss of appetite. Being too big for a lumbar puncture, he suggests brain surgery. During the procedure, the patient becomes blind. The team suggest this could be MS, while House still thinks it's diabetes. Cameron visits the patient who becomes agitated when House still suggests it's diabetes that's causing the problems. He repeatedly refuses the sugar drink that Cameron tries to give him, stating that he'll refuse any treatment that has to do with his weight. Meanwhile, House visits a lawyer. The lawyer recommends a plea bargain, but House refuses this. They then decide to go to court. House visits the patient again to try to coerce him to cooperate. While the patient refuses and starts physically fighting House in order to stop him from doing the procedure, House notices his hands are clubbed and suggests X-raying his hands, among other diagnostic tests. Cameron asks how the patient will agree to the procedures, when House tells her to tell the patient it's for lung cancer. The tests confirm this diagnosis, and Cameron informs the patient he has terminal lung cancer. After a long sad sigh, George responds with \\"I never smoked, C'est la vie\\". The episode ends with Tritter interviewing Wilson in his hotel room. Tritter confronts him with prescriptions that do not match Wilson's signature, from a previous episode where House stole a prescription pad from Wilson and forged his signature. Wilson fails to contain his surprise and lies to cover this by saying he sometimes signs his name differently. Sensing the lie, Tritter gives him another chance, but Wilson sticks to his version. Tritter then leaves citing the trouble both Wilson and House would be in if he is lying. Tritter leaves the room leaving Wilson visibly agitated. The episode ends with House seen in his apartment playing his guitar, earlier seen when he discovered Tritter there. ==External links== * * Category:House (season 3) episodes Category:2006 American television episodes fr:Que sera sera (Dr House) ","title":"Que Sera Sera (House)"},{"id":"7821960","text":"Joseph Buffington (November 27, 1803 – February 3, 1872) was a Whig member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania.

In her writing, she also used the pen-name Soledad. ==Personal life== Adela Zamudio was born in La Paz, Bolivia, in 1854, to an upper-class family. She attended a public elementary school and was also tutored by her father, Don Adolfo Zamudio and her mother, Doña Modesta Rivero de Zamudio. ==Career== As a teacher, Zamudio taught at Escuela San Alberto, and later became a director of a girls' high school, which later became known as Liceo Adela Zamudio. Her poetry and fiction dealt primarily with the social struggles of Bolivia, often with a romantic feeling invoked towards revolution. Non-religious, her writing was highly intellectual. She published her first poem, Two Roses, when she was 15, but did not publish her first book until 20 years later. In 1926 she was awarded the Bolivian Crown of Distinction award. Her pseudonym, Soledad (English: Solitude), was used by her to reflect her often lonely and misunderstood self, who sought to escape conservative Bolivian society. Her work, Quo Vadis, caused a stir amongst upper-class women and clerics, and animosity towards her work increased. Her struggles with religion caused her to choose to no longer teach religion at the school she directed and the League of Catholic Women publicly condemned her. Zamudio also wrote articles for publications and newspapers, promoting democratic reforms and women's rights, including the legalization of divorce. ==Legacy== Her birthday, October 11, is celebrated in Bolivia as the \\"Day of Bolivian Women.\\" Zamudio is a featured figure on Judy Chicago's installation piece The Dinner Party, being represented as one of the 999 names on the Heritage Floor.Chicago, 256. ==Works== * Essayos poéticos (Poetic Texts) (1887) * Violeta o la princesa azul (Violeta or the Blue Princess) (1890) * El castillo negro (The Black Castle) (1906) * Intimas (Close Friends) (1913) * Ráfagas (Squalls) (1914) * Peregrinando (Travelling) (1943) * Cuentos breves (Short Novels) (1943) ==Notes== ==References== *Chicago, Judy.

In his later years he managed sides in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. ==Playing career== Born in the Tollcross area of Glasgow, Harris began his senior career began with Partick Thistle, whom he joined from Vale of Clyde F.C. in 1913. He spent seven seasons with Partick, \\"guesting\\" for Distillery and Fulham during World War I before joining Newcastle United for £3,300 in May 1920. He played 174 league games for the Magpies, scoring 87 times. He was a regular scorer in Newcastle's FA Cup campaigns and scored a total of 14 goals in 20 appearances in that competition. He helped them win the 1923–24 FA Cup, scoring the first goal in the final. That season he also earned his first (and only) cap for the Scottish national side, in a 1–1 draw with England at Wembley.Neil Harris - A Squad, Scottish Football Association. Harris joined Notts County for £3,000 in November 1925, then joined Oldham Athletic in 1927. He returned to Scotland with Third Lanark in 1929 before accepting the position of player-manager at Burton Town prior to the 1931-32 season. ==Managerial career== Harris spent one year in charge of Burton then moved to former side Distillery in a purely managerial capacity. He was appointed manager of Swansea Town in 1934 and soon after arriving at the Vetch Field signed his son John, a defender, from Swindon Town. Incidentally, Neil's brother Joshua ('Jack') was also a professional footballer, who played for several years with Leeds United among others; however, they were not related to Joe Harris, also from east Glasgow who played for Partick and Newcastle in the same era. Five years later Harris moved to his son's former side, after Ted Vizard left Swindon in June 1939. Due to the impending war, he was originally only offered a year's contract but, after negotiation, this was extended to end in March 1941. Just three games into his first season in charge, the Football League programme was abandoned, and Harris remained in charge for the club's season in the South West Regional League. During this season, players were often called up for military duties in the build-up to a game, and every club in the league used \\"guests\\" to make up the starting eleven - sometimes players even played under aliases to avoid detection by their officers. Before one game at Bristol City, Harris, now 45, was forced to come out of retirement himself to make up the numbers. He borrowed a pair of boots which were too small, and lost two toenails as the Town lost 5–2. By the end of the season, it was decided that the club could no longer continue whilst the war did, and Harris was relieved of his duties in August 1940, with the intention of him returning to the hotseat when the war ended. Harris died a year later. ==References== Category:1894 births Category:1941 deaths Category:Footballers from Glasgow Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scotland international footballers Category:Partick Thistle F.C. players Category:St Mirren F.C. players Category:Kilmarnock F.C. players Category:Vale of Clyde F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Scottish Junior Football Association players Category:English Football League players Category:Lisburn Distillery F.C. players Category:Fulham F.C. wartime guest players Category:Newcastle United F.C. players Category:Notts County F.C. players Category:Oldham Athletic A.F.C. players Category:Third Lanark A.C. players Category:Swindon Town F.C. players Category:Scottish football managers Category:Lisburn Distillery F.C. managers Category:English Football League managers Category:Swansea City A.F.C. managers Category:Swindon Town F.C. managers Category:Place of death missing Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Neil Harris (footballer, born 1894)"},{"id":"7822159","text":"Drag Pack was Ford Motor Company's marketing name for an option package available in the United States for some of its car models that included a remote mounted oil cooler and higher ratio rear axle gear (plus engine components on some models).

It was located on Blasieholmen in central Stockholm. During its years in use, from 1875 to 1925, it was often considered as Sweden's foremost national theatre (as opposed to the Royal Dramatic Theatre)). ==History== Svenska Teatern, or Nya Teatern, was founded by the actor Edvard Stjernström (1816-1877). The new theater was erected after drawings by Ernst Jacobsson (1839-1905). It was in its time Stockholm's largest theatre, with 1,150 seats in its two stalls and four galleries (as a comparison, today's national stage Dramaten has around 700 seats for its main stage). The theatre was also equipped with the first rotating stage in Sweden and had its own ballet-ensemble that was known worldwide for its quality. The Swedish Theatre's productions were known for their luxurious decor and splendor. It was here that the original Swedish stagings of Henrik Ibsen's most well-known plays took place, as well as a number of great productions of William Shakespeare's and Anton Chekhov's dramatic works. Under the directorship of Ludvig Josephson, it staged the premières of August Strindberg's Master Olof in 1881 and Sir Bengt's Wife and Lucky Peter's Journey in the following year.Lane (1998, 1040) and Meyer (1985, 89, 95-96, 106). Many of the world's greatest theatre companies came to perform at the Swedish Theatre, including Stanislavski's Moscow Art Theatre and Reinhardt's Deutsches Theater. The Swedish Theatre also toured abroad, with several productions in Moscow, Berlin, Paris, Oslo, and Copenhagen among others. Most of Sweden's greatest stage actors of the early 20th century were part of the theatre's ensemble: Anders de Wahl, Gerda Lundequist, Tora Teje, Inga Tidblad, Gösta Ekman d.ä., Pauline Brunius and Hugo Björne were among others. After the death of the founder Edvard Stjernström, the theatre was run by his widow, the playwright Louise Granberg (1812-1907), from 1877 to 1880. The Swedish Theatre was for a long time the prime jewel in the theatrical empire of Swedish theatre manager Albert Ranft (1858–1938). The theatre was devastated in a fire on June 30, 1925. It was never rebuilt. Since then, the Royal Dramatic Theatre has been seen as the country's main national stage. ==References== ==Other Sources== * Lane, Harry. 1998. \\"Strindberg, August.\\" In The Cambridge Guide to Theatre.

He also was the head coach of the Washington Redskins and offensive coordinator of the Miami Dolphins. ==Playing career== Born in New Castle, Pennsylvania, McPeak was a star defensive end for the University of Pittsburgh. He was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers where he played from 1949 to 1957. During the final two years of his playing career he also became an assistant coach for the team. ==Head coaching career== In 1959, McPeak joined the Washington Redskins as an assistant under head coach Mike Nixon. After Nixon's dismissal following the 1960 NFL season, McPeak was promoted to head coach and general manager, and remained in that position until 1965. Although the Redskins did not have a winning season under McPeak with an overall 21-46-3 record, the team acquired players, many of whom would become future Hall of Famers, that would eventually play a part in their later winning years. They include Sonny Jurgensen Bobby Mitchell, Charley Taylor, Jerry Smith, Len Hauss, and Chris Hanburger. ==Later coaching and scouting== In 1967, McPeak joined the Detroit Lions as an offensive coordinator, a position he held until 1972 when he moved on to the Miami Dolphins to replace Howard Schnellenberger who became head coach of the Baltimore Colts. His tenure in Miami would last for only two seasons due to complications suffered after a stroke, which he spent several years recovering from.

The differential forms of these equations require that there is always an open neighbourhood around the point to which they are applied, otherwise the vector fields and H are not differentiable. In other words, the medium must be continuous. On the interface of two different media with different values for electrical permittivity and magnetic permeability, that condition does not apply. However, the interface conditions for the electromagnetic field vectors can be derived from the integral forms of Maxwell's equations. ==Interface conditions for electric field vectors== === Electric field strength === :\\\\mathbf{n}_{12} \\\\times (\\\\mathbf{E}_2 - \\\\mathbf{E}_1) = \\\\mathbf{0} where: \\\\mathbf{n}_{12} is normal vector from medium 1 to medium 2. Therefore, the tangential component of E is continuous across the interface. :{ class=\\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\\" width=\\"80%\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\" !Outline of proof from Faraday's law - We begin with the integral form of Faraday's law: :\\\\oint_{\\\\partial \\\\Sigma} \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\cdot d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\ell} = - \\\\int_\\\\Sigma \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{B}}{\\\\partial t} \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{A} :Choose \\\\Sigma as a small square across the interface. Then, have the sides perpendicular to the interface shrink to infinitesimal length. The area of integration now looks like a line, which has zero area. In other words: :\\\\lim_{line length \\\\to 0}\\\\mathbf{A} = 0 :Since \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{B} / \\\\partial t remains finite in this limit, the whole right hand side goes to zero. All that is left is: :\\\\oint_{\\\\partial \\\\Sigma} \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\cdot d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\ell} = 0 Two of our sides are infinitesimally small, leaving only :\\\\int_{medium 1} \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\cdot d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\ell} +\\\\int_{medium 2} \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\cdot d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\ell}= 0 :Assuming we made our square small enough that E is roughly constant, its magnitude can be pulled out of the integral. As the remaining sides to our original loop, the d\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\ell} in each region run in opposite directions, so we define one of them as the tangent unit vector \\\\boldsymbol{t} and the other as -\\\\boldsymbol{t} :(\\\\mathbf{E}_2 \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{t} ) l - (\\\\mathbf{E}_1 \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{t} ) l = \\\\mathbf{0} After dividing by l, and rearranging, :(\\\\mathbf{E}_2 - \\\\mathbf{E}_1 )\\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{t} = \\\\mathbf{0} This argument works for any tangential direction. The difference in electric field dotted into any tangential vector is zero, meaning only the components of \\\\mathbf{E} parallel to the normal vector can change between mediums. Thus, the difference in electric field vector is parallel to the normal vector. Two parallel vectors always have a cross product of zero. :\\\\mathbf{n}_{12} \\\\times (\\\\mathbf{E}_2 - \\\\mathbf{E}_1) = \\\\mathbf{0} } === Electric displacement field === :(\\\\mathbf{D}_2 - \\\\mathbf{D}_1) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{n}_{12} = \\\\sigma_{s} \\\\mathbf{n}_{12} is the unit normal vector from medium 1 to medium 2. \\\\sigma_{s} is the surface charge density between the media (unbounded charges only, not coming from polarization of the materials). Therefore, the normal component of D has a step of surface charge on the interface surface. If there is no surface charge on the interface, the normal component of D is continuous. ==Interface conditions for magnetic field vectors== === For magnetic flux density === :(\\\\mathbf{B}_2 - \\\\mathbf{B}_1) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{n}_{12} = 0 where: \\\\mathbf{n}_{12} is normal vector from medium 1 to medium 2. Therefore, the normal component of B is continuous across the interface. === For magnetic field strength === :\\\\mathbf{n}_{12} \\\\times (\\\\mathbf{H}_2 - \\\\mathbf{H}_1) = \\\\mathbf{j}_s where: \\\\mathbf{n}_{12} is the unit normal vector from medium 1 to medium 2. \\\\mathbf{j}_s is the surface current density between the two media (unbounded current only, not coming from polarisation of the materials). Therefore, the tangential component of H is continuous across the surface if there's no surface current present. ==Discussion according to the media beside the interface== === If medium 1 & 2 are perfect dielectrics === There are no charges nor surface currents at the interface, and so the tangential component of H and the normal component of D are also continuous. === If medium 1 is a perfect dielectric and medium 2 is a perfect metal === There are charges and surface currents at the interface, and so the tangential component of H and the normal component of D are not continuous. == Boundary conditions == The boundary conditions must not be confused with the interface conditions. For numerical calculations, the space where the calculation of the electromagnetic field is achieved must be restricted to some boundaries. This is done by assuming conditions at the boundaries which are physically correct and numerically solvable in finite time. In some cases, the boundary conditions resume to a simple interface condition. The most usual and simple example is a fully reflecting (electric wall) boundary - the outer medium is considered as a perfect conductor. In some cases, it is more complicated: for example, the reflection-less (i.e. open) boundaries are simulated as perfectly matched layer or magnetic wall that do not resume to a single interface. == See also == * Maxwell's equations == References == Category:Electromagnetism Category:Boundary conditions ","title":"Interface conditions for electromagnetic fields"},{"id":"7822250","text":"North East Wales NHS Trust () was an NHS Trust in Wales.

BKM is based on computing complex logarithms (L-mode) and exponentials (E-mode) using a method similar to the algorithm Henry Briggs used to compute logarithms. By using a precomputed table of logarithms of negative powers of two, the BKM algorithm computes elementary functions using only integer add, shift, and compare operations. BKM is similar to CORDIC, but uses a table of logarithms rather than a table of arctangents. On each iteration, a choice of coefficient is made from a set of nine complex numbers, 1, 0, −1, i, −i, 1+i, 1−i, −1+i, −1−i, rather than only −1 or +1 as used by CORDIC. BKM provides a simpler method of computing some elementary functions, and unlike CORDIC, BKM needs no result scaling factor. The convergence rate of BKM is approximately one bit per iteration, like CORDIC, but BKM requires more precomputed table elements for the same precision because the table stores logarithms of complex operands. As with other algorithms in the shift-and-add class, BKM is particularly well-suited to hardware implementation. The relative performance of software BKM implementation in comparison to other methods such as polynomial or rational approximations will depend on the availability of fast multi-bit shifts (i.e. a barrel shifter) or hardware floating point arithmetic. ==References== * * * https://web.archive.org/web/20180711094855/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fabien_Rico/publication/226548529_A_Radix-10_BKM_Algorithm_for_Computing_Transcendentals_on_Pocket_Computers/links/00b49517b782924cd8000000/A-Radix-10-BKM- Algorithm-for-Computing-Transcendentals-on-Pocket-Computers.pdf --> * * ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * Category:Computer arithmetic Category:Shift-and-add algorithms Category:Digit-by-digit algorithms Category:1994 introductions Category:1994 in science ","title":"BKM algorithm"},{"id":"7822321","text":"Arancón is a municipality in the province of Soria, Spain, located at the foot of the mountain range of El Almuerzo and Mount Cencejo.

She was a cousin of Jock Whitney, owner of the dual Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Easter Hero and latterly American Ambassador in London, and granddaughter of William C. Whitney, a wealthy American businessman, politician and racehorse owner. Paget was educated at Heathfield School, Ascot, Berkshire. She lived for the most part in Hermit's Wood, Nightingales Lane, (she also owned Pollards Wood Grange), Chalfont St. Giles, Buckinghamshire, England.David Ashforth on Dorothy Paget in the Racing Post accessed through The Free Library website ==Horse racing and gambling== Dorothy Paget's mother was a member of the New York Whitney family, which was one of the most prominent thoroughbred horse racing and breeding families in America. Paget too owned a stable of thoroughbreds as well as the Ballymacoll Stud breeding farm in County Meath, Ireland. Her horses won a total of 1,532 races in both flat and hurdling. She was the British flat racing Champion Owner in 1943, the year her horse Straight Deal won The Derby. She was leading National Hunt owner in 1933–34, 1940–41 and 1951–52. She owned seven Cheltenham Gold Cup winners, Golden Miller five times, 1932–1936 inclusive, Roman Hackle in 1940 and Mont Tremblant in 1952. Her four Champion Hurdle winners were Insurance in 1932 and 1933, Solford in 1940 and Distel in 1946. Golden Miller also provided her with her solitary victory in the Grand National in 1934, still the only occasion any horse has won the two major prizes of British steeplechasing in the same season. Grand National winners Although Paget spent today's equivalent of many millions of pounds on bloodstock, Golden Miller and Insurance were by far the best known of her horses. They were purchased from Mr. Phillip Carr (the father of A. W. Carr, the Nottinghamshire and England cricket captain) for 12,000 guineas (£441,000 in today's currency) for both of them. Her Derby winner, Straight Deal, was home bred and sire of the Champion Hurdle winner of 1957, Merry Deal, and it was at her Ballymacoll Stud that Arkle was foaled. On her death in 1960, Ballymacoll Stud was acquired by the English industrialist, Sir Michael Sobell. Her many trainers, seventeen or eighteen in all, included Basil Briscoe, Owen Anthony, Frenchie Nicholson, Fulke Walwyn, Walter Nightingall (under both codes), Henri Jelliss, Sir Gordon Richards and, for a brief period, Fred Darling. She was considered a notoriously difficult owner, often phoning her trainer in the middle of the night. She famously, and very publicly fell out with Basil Briscoe after Golden Miller's repeated failure to win a second Grand National, despite it being very clear that the horse despised the Aintree course. She also threw a screaming fit at Fulke Walwyn after the trainer could 'only' deliver five winners of a six race card. In her early years Paget hunted enthusiastically. At the outbreak of war in 1939 and for some five years previously the two biggest racecourse gamblers, as opposed to professional backers, were both women. The other was Mrs. J.V. Rank (the sister in law of J. Arthur Rank)Racing Colours of Famous Owners: Mrs J.V. Rank who, like Paget, had a number of horses in training but nothing like so many. Neither would hesitate to have £10,000 (£320,000 in today's money) or more on their horses whenever they ran. ==Motor racing== In the late 1920s financed the team of supercharged Bentleys created by Sir Henry (Tim) Birkin, a member of the Nottingham lace family. ==Benefactress== Paget is notably responsible for financing an old age home for Russian émigrés at Château de la Cossonnerie (\\"La Maison Russe\\")The history of la Cossonnerie in the Magazine Municipal Sainte-Geneviëve-des-Bois, No 239, 2007 (originally an 18th-century farm, which had been enlarged at the beginning of the 19th century) as well as the Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery in France. Dorothy Paget took profound interest in the fate of the Russian refugees after having attended a finishing school in Paris founded by Elena Orlov and sister Princess Vera Meshchersky1927, April 27: Princess Vera Meshchersky founds the \\"Russian House, in Rue de la Cossonerie, Saint-Geneviève-des-Bois (one of the Russian Red Cross trustees and daughter of Karl von Struve). Vera's niece, \\"Olili\\" (Olga Mumm, daughter of Vera's sister Olga) was Dorothy's beloved, long-time companion and with her, managed the breeding and training programs of Paget's racing stables. It was Dorothy Paget who purchased the plot for the cemetery, where such notable Russians as Ivan Bunin, Andrei Tarkovsky, and Rudolf Nureyev were later buried. She also saw to it that the residents of the old- age home \\"were supplied with turkey and plum pudding at Christmas time\\".Quintin Gilbey \\"Queen of the Turf; The Dorothy Paget Story\\"James E. Hassell. Russian Refugees in France and the United States Between the World Wars. . Page 68. There is a street named after her: Rue Miss Paget in Sainte- Geneviève-des-Bois. ==Later life== Dorothy Paget lived an eccentric lifestyle at home, spending most of the day in bed and rising at night. Most bookmakers employed a member of staff to be on the phone at night to take bets solely from Miss Paget and also allowed her to place bets on races that had already taken place the previous day purely on her oath that she did not know the result. Her honesty in this regard was noted by the fact the majority of the horses she backed were already known by the bookmaker to have been beaten. In return however the bookmakers always honoured the occasions where she selected horses they knew to have won. She also assigned her staff different colours, with the exception of green, which she despised, and would use the colours in place of their names when speaking to them or of them. Paget died of heart failure on 9 February 1960, aged fifty-four. Image:Maison Russe en SGdB.JPGLa Maison Russe from Rue Miss Paget ==References== ==Further reading== * Gilbey, Quintin.

She was the first female journalist in Croatia and is among the most read Croatian writers. ==Early life and education== Marija Jurić was born on 2 March 1873 in the village of Negovec in a family of Ivan Jurić and Josipa Domin. She had two brothers and a sister. Baptized in a Catholic church on 3 March 1873, she was given the baptismal name Mariana. She later spoke of her family as being wealthy but unhappy. She spent her childhood in Hrvatsko Zagorje on the Golubovec estate owned by Baron Geza Rauch which her father managed. She was educated by private tutors alongside baron Rauch's children. Zagorka attended elementary school in Varaždin were she stood out as very intelligent and talented, finishing all grades with the highest marks.Lasić, Stanko: Književni počeci Marije Jurić Zagorke (1973.- 1910.), Uvod u monografiju, Zagreb, 1986, Znanje Although her father wanted to send her to Switzerland to attend high school, which baron Rauch agreed to pay, her mother objected so she eventually attended an all-girls high school at the Convent of the Sisters of Mercy in Zagreb. At her mother's insistence and with her father's objection, Zagorka married Slovak-Hungarian railway officer Andrija Matraja, 17 years her senior, in an arranged marriage held at the end of 1891. She disapproved of her husband's chauvinism against Croats. The couple lived in Szombathely for three years, during which she suffered a mental breakdown, but they eventually divorced. She learned Telegraphy and Hungarian during the time she spent in Hungary which helped her later in her career as a journalist. After dramatically escaping her abusive husband in 1895, Zagorka at first lived with her uncle in Srijemska Mitrovica and afterwards in Zagreb. Matraja accused her of being mentally unstable so she was kept in an asylum for a period of time, but was eventually discharged when doctors realized that she was healthy. She managed to get a divorce with her father's help but was proclaimed guilty of marriage failure after her mother testified against her, so her former husband had no obligation to pay alimony or to return her personal belongings.Jakobović Fribec, Slavica: \\"Marija Jurić« u leksikonu: Francisca de Haan, Krassimira Daskalova, Anna Loutfi (Eds.), A Biographical dictionary of women's movements and feminisms - Central, Eastern, and South Eastern Europe; 19th and 20th centuries, 1st ed., Central European University Press, Budapest, 2006, p. 195 – 199 ==Journalist career== During high school, Zagorka edited her first newspaper - Samostanske novine [Convent Newspaper]. She had a single copy that she lent to other students. In 1891, she edited the only student newspaper in Krapina - Zagorsko proljeće [Spring of Zagorje] under the pseudonym M. Jurica Zagorski (implying she was a man). Following the publication of the first issue, it was banned because of what Zagorka wrote in the introduction titled \\"The Spirit of Matija Gubec Accuses - Later Generations Haven't Used Spilled Blood and Are Still Slaves\\". In 1896, she wrote unsigned articles for the Hrvatski branik and Hrvatska Posavina newspapers. During the same year, Zagorka started working in Obzor, first as proofreader because the board of directors and editor-in-chief Šime Mazzuro objected to her for being a woman, but after bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer's intervention, as a journalist, although she had to sit in a separate room so no one would see her. She mostly wrote on politics, and occasionally travelogues from Zagorje, biographies, autobiographies, feuilletons, humoresques, short stories and novels in sequels. On 31 October 1896, her first article in Obzor titled Egy Percz (Hungarian for One Brief Moment) was published. In the article, Zagorka wrote about the exclusive usage of the Hungarian language - which majority of Croats didn't understand - at the train stations in Croatia, which is why passengers didn't know where the trains were going.Hergešić, Ivo: Introduction in Tajna krvavog mosta, Džepna knjiga, Zagreb, 1987, p. 9 She later reported on political developments from the Croatian-Hungarian Parliament in Budapest and from Vienna, adding comments on politicians, and interviews and notes on unofficial political talks and general political atmosphere, which significantly contributed to the increase of Obzor's circulation. After Obzor's editor-in-chief J. Pasarić and his deputy M. Heimerl were imprisoned in 1903 during Khuen-Héderváry's strongest oppression of Croats, Zagorka edited Obzor for five months by herself. A vocal opponent of magyarization and germanization of Croatia, she was imprisoned in solitary confinement for ten days for organizing demonstrations against Khuen- Héderváry. However, her editorial work in Obzor wasn't mentioned in 1936 Obzor's Memorial Book which deeply offended her.Lasić, Stanko: Književni počeci Marije Jurić Zagorke (1973.- 1910.), Uvod u monografiju, Znanje, Zagreb, 1986, p. 110 During this time, she also wrote articles for Hungarian opposition newspapers Népszava and Magyarország. In 1910, she participated in the founding of the Croatian Journalists' Association. During the same year, she married her fellow journalist Slavko Amadej Vodvařka. They divorced in 1914. In 1917, Zagorka left Obzor and started her own magazine - Zabavnik and also wrote articles for Jutarnji list. Afterward, she published and edited first Croatian woman magazine Ženski list [Womans' Paper] (1925–38), personally writing most of the articles, which had a feminist and patriotic note. Zagorka also wrote articles for dozens of other prominent newspapers, including Vijenac and Novi list. She participated in the foundation of the Croatian Female Writers' Association in 1936. In 1938, she left Ženski list dissatisfied with the majority of the editorial staff that become supporters of conservatism and clericalism contrary to their original support for liberalism and feminism. In 1939, she founded magazine Hrvatica [Croatian Woman] (1939–41). All of the proceedings acquired from the subscribers were spent on the printing, while Zagorka volunteered. During World War II, she was persecuted by Ustaše who forbid her from publishing Hrvatica, seized all the existing magazine copies, subscription money, and even furniture from her apartment.Hergešić, Ivo: Introduction in Tajna krvavog mosta, Džepna knjiga, Zagreb, 1987, p. 21-22 Faced with constant harassment, she attempted suicide. In 1944, she tried to join the Yugoslav Partisans but was rejected. Following the end of the war, she became excluded from the cultural scene for which she blamed some of her former, misogynist colleges from Obzor who believed that woman should only write romance novels. Since she didn't have a pension and was therefore dependent on the help of acquaintances and readers, she decided to published an advertisement in which she sought someone who would regularly bring her food. Among several candidates, she selected two younger men, Nikola Smolčić and Leo Car, who introduced themselves as cousins but were, in fact, a couple. She eventually asked them to move in with her. It was later revealed from the letters she secretly sent to her friends that she was heavily mistreated by Smolčić and Car. Zagorka joined the Women's Antifascist Front of Croatia, Slobodna Dalmacija purchased the copyright to her works, and in 1952, she became an independent publisher collaborating with the Otokar Keršovani Printing Office. ==Death== Zagorka died in Zagreb at the age of 84. She was buried on Mirogoj Cemetery by the chapel on the right side from the entrance, but not long after, her body was moved to the arcades on the left, away from the entrance. A statue of Zagorka in Zagreb, Croatia ==Legacy== Zagorka's property was inherited by Smolčić, who died not long after, passing the property to his partner, Car. Although Zagorka wanted her apartment on Dolac Market to be turned into a memorial center, Car did not respect her last wish, renovated the apartment and continued to live in it until his death in September 1986. In 2009, City of Zagreb bought the apartment from Car's heirs and turned it into a Memorial apartment of Marija Jurić Zagorka - operated by the educational NGO Centre for Women's Studies Zagreb - in which visitors can learn more about Zagorka and other influential women in the fields of culture, politics, science, and human rights. Every year, at the end of November, the Center organizes a cultural and scientific event entitled Days of Marija Jurić Zagorka. Every third Thursday of the month, the Center organizes public lectures on Zagorka and women's literature. In a 2005 poll compiled by Vjesnik, a Zagreb daily newspaper, Zagorka came second in the list of most popular Croatian writers of all time. Croatian Journalists' Association awards each year Marija Jurić Zagorka Award for excellence in written, radio, television, online and investigative journalism. == Works == None of her novels have been translated into English, but two are available in German: The Witch of Gric (1995) and Malleus Maleficarum (1972). The latter title is the same as that of the \\"textbook\\" published in 1488 about how to find the witches, though Zagorka's novel is a fictional tale, not a witch-hunting manual. 11 of her novels, published in Croatian, are found in the Library of Congress. * Kneginja iz Petrinjske ulice (The Princess from Petrinjska Street): Zagorka's first murder mystery. * Grička vještica (The Witch of Grič)- cycle of 7 novels (Secret of the Bloody Bridge, Countess Nera, Malleus Maleficarum, The Rival of Maria Theresa I, The Rival of Maria Theresa II, The Courtly Camarilla, Rebel on the Throne) - Zagorka's most popular work, combining genres of a historical novel, romance and adventure. Set in the second half of the 18th century, it tells the story of a beautiful young Countess Nera Keglević, who was raised isolated from society by her grandmother. Famed for her beauty and open-minded conduct, she becomes the jewel of Zagrebian aristocracy, but her popularity among men causes strong discountenance among envious women who see her as a threat. Due to Nera's attempts of saving unfortunate low class women from witch-burnings, she herself gets accused of witchcraft, which opens a protest of the aristocracy against the law for condemning a member of their society. All complaints to the Queen are soon hindered by the female society, leaving Nera at the mercy of the corrupted law. She is soon saved by the infamous fiery pandur Captain Siniša, who dressed up as the Devil in order to frighten the crowd and abduct her. Eventually Empress Maria Theresa gets informed of the scandalous condemnation of her friend's granddaughter and, by the persuasion of her son Joseph, reverses the process against Nera. Nera and Siniša are soon caught by a new set of social and imperial intrigues threatening the happiness they fought so hard to obtain. The story ends with a look into the tragic life and reign of Emperor Joseph II, the \\"Rebel on the Throne\\". The first book, \\"Secret of the Bloody Bridge\\", is set in the same period but works as an independent story, unlike the later novels which are thematically tied to the story \\"Countess Nera\\". The characters from the first book appear again in the later books. Despite the greater popularity of the second story, this book is widely considered by experts to be Zagorka's best literary work. The book starts with a set of mysterious serial murders, each body found under the Bloody Bridge that connects Grič and Kaptol. The story revolves around Count Juraj Meško who is set on unmasking Baron Makar for the murder of his wife, and a poor servant girl Stanka whom her mistress dresses in the manner of a boy and presents to the society as her young nephew: Lieutenant Stanko. Meško soon grows fond of the little lieutenant and asks for his friendship and help, which Stanka accepts. The girl falls in love with the Count, risking her employment and head by the Baroness. She keeps on assisting the Count who does not recognize or return her love due to his conviction that his little friend is a boy. The story involves genres of adventure, romance, and history present in all of her novels but stands out as the only crime novel next to the Princess of Petrinjska Street. * Kći Lotrščaka (Daughter of the Lotrščak) - A historical romance novel that deals with the 16th century nationalist uprising of the Croatian nobility against the pillaging practices of Margrave Georg von Brandenburg. The book is exceptional for reflecting on numerous old Zagrebian legends and fairy tales, presenting elements of the supernatural and religious miracles. It reflects on the famous painting of the \\"Madonna of the Stone Gate\\" which became the Holy patron of Zagreb after miraculously surviving a fire while all else, including the painting frame, burned down. The story is centered on the Grič princess Manduša, daughter of the Lotršćak, famed for her gentile kindness, religious upbringing and beauty. When a man named the \\"Antichrist\\" arrives at Grič, the clergy condemns him to be executed. After Manduša becomes a social outcast after being accused by the bishop and his mistress of being a child left on her father's doorstep, she decides to sacrifice herself by saving the Antichrist from execution by offering her hand in marriage. They are both banished from the city, at which point the story starts to unfold through the open battle of nobles with The Margrave and the Kaptolian clerics. The story deals with numerous issues such as the nature of marriage bringing up controversial questions such as the marriage of Catholic priests. * Plameni inkvizitori (The Flaming Inquisitors) also called Kameni križari (The Stone Crusaders). The story centers around the 13th century historical heroes \\"Knight Sokol\\" and the infamous robber Tomo Crni (Black Tomo). * Gordana - Zagorka's longest work, dealing with the death of Arpad King Matthias Corvinus, the struggle between Corvinus's widow Beatrice of Naples and his illegitimate son Janos for the throne, and the events leading up to the Battle of Mohács in the early 16th century. The novel tells the story of the Croatian spirit through the fictional heroine Gordana Brezovačka and her undying national pride. * Republikanci deals with the Napoleonic wars and the pro-Illyrian nationalistic movement led by Croatian Ban Maksimilijan Vrhovac. * Vitez slavonske ravni (The Knight of the Slavonian plain) Set in the time of Maria Theresa. It tells the story of an impoverished noblewoman Krasanka and a masked knight who threatens the plundering bands by the use of what they see as \\"magic\\". He soon becomes a legend among the lands of Slavonia gaining nicknames such as \\"The Elf Knight\\" due to his use of pyrotechnics to frighten the superstitious bandits. It stands out as Zagorka's only literary work that's not thematically connected with Zagreb. * Jadranka - Zagorka's final novel, dealing with the repression of Croatian nationalist movements under the reign of Emperor Franz Joseph. * Roblje * Kamen na cesti (A Stone on the Road) - An autobiographical novel detailing the author's early life. The main themes are the authors own undying patriotism is which she finds the comfort and reason to overcome all tragedies and obstacles in her life. The story starts in the authors tragic childhood filled with physical abuse from her mother and the neglect of her father. It describes a wealthy jet unhappy family, where the author herself, though being casually abused by her mother both physically and verbally, is the least mistreated child. Although told in a romanticized style, the book does a lot of psychological introspective of the narrator, analyzing both herself and others. It deals with each situation, opinion, ideal and theory by showing that things aren’t how they present themselves. The center of the plot deals with her mothers decision of marrying her daughter to a 26-year older man, who eventually demands that she abandons her nationality and writes in the Hungarian spirit.

In his early youth he was a pupil of Rabbi Heshel in Cracow, and on the latter's death he continued his studies under R. Heshel's successor, Rabbi Leib Fischeles, whose daughter he married. Samuel officiated as rabbi in Shydlow, Poland, whence he was called in September 1691 to the rabbinate of Fürth, Germany. In his new office he displayed great activity, and was the recipient of a good income; nevertheless his new surroundings were distasteful to him. The reason is not known; but it is recorded that he longed for his former rabbinate. In 1694 he received a call to return to Shydlow, which he soon accepted, as appears from his approbation of the work Ir Binyamin (Frankfort- on-the-Oder, 1698), in which he is mentioned as rabbi of the Polish town. Samuel wrote in Hebrew a clear and comprehensive commentary, known as Beit Shmuel, on the Shulhan Aruk, Eben ha'Ezer, which appeared in Dyhernfurth in 1689, being the first Hebrew work printed there. Later he thoroughly revised it; and a second edition, with several emendations and additions, appeared at Fürth in 1694. He wrote also several responsa and opinions, one of which is published in Ḥinnuk Bet Yehudah, No. 131 (Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1705).

The engagement was intended to move Union forces into an area where Confederate forces were gathering as they prepared to move on Suffolk, Virginia. Originally planned as a coordinated two-pronged attack with a naval flotilla supporting an infantry advance on Franklin, Virginia, communications delays caused the Union Navy to start the mission before the Army was ready to support it. Instead, found Union Naval forces on the Blackwater River greatly outnumbered by Confederate infantrymen and ultimately forced to retreat. The naval action alone is also known as the Action at Crumpler's Bluff or the Battle of Crumpler's Bluff. Simultaneously, a nearby Army reconnaissance team conducted a failed assault on the town on the basis that the audibly nearby Naval forces—which they did not know were then in retreat—would bring support. The outcome left the Union forces with a combined 5 casualties and 21 wounded. Dialogue between officers following the conflict left the Union navy questioning the usefulness of gunboats in joint expedition settings in which they would not be capable of supporting themselves. ==The conflict== ===Background=== Receiving orders early September 12, 1862, the Confederate Army's 4th North Carolina (NC) Cavalry immediately proceeded from Garysburg, North Carolina to Franklin, Virginia, arriving late the next day. There, the 4th NC Cavalry, under the command of a Colonel Dennis Dozier Ferebee, was joined by the 52nd North Carolina Infantry, Edward Graham's Petersburg Artillery and (two weeks later) the 11th North Carolina Infantry. The 4th NC Cavalry's first major assignment was to construct a floating bridge across the nearby Blackwater River to replace the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad bridge and thereby facilitate the eastward transfer of men and equipment into Franklin; Col. Ferebee reported the bridge finished on the 18th. A small Union Army cavalry force was stationed in nearby Suffolk, Virginia under the command of Major General John J. Peck. On September 23, Peck sent Colonel Samuel P. Spear to reconnoiter Franklin and the Confederates therein. Spear reported back to Peck about the Confederate's replacement bridge capable of supporting artillery pieces, as well as an estimated Confederate concentration of 10,000-12,000 men. Peck forwarded this information on to his commanding officer, Major General John Adams Dix who, in turn, developed a twofold mission to roust the enemy from Franklin and destroy the floating bridge with a joint service attack with the Union Army and Navy respectively. LCDR C. W. Flusser (1864) Dix requested Union naval support from Acting Rear Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee. Lee, in turn, sent orders to Lieutenant Commander C. W. Flusser, directing him to give all assistance to General Dix's purposes. Three United States Navy steam-powered ferryboats stationed at Albemarle Sound were sent; the , commanded by Lieutenant Commander Flusser, the , commanded by Acting Lieutenant Edmund R. Colhoun, and the , commanded by Acting Master Charles A. French. Acting on Union picket intelligence of the Confederate's position in Franklin, both Generals Peck and Dix felt that it would be wiser to wait on the joint assault. Unfortunately, because Dix's messenger arrived five hours late, Commander Flusser never received the word the former's forces were delaying \\"until about the 10th\\". Peck did however order a reconnaissance mission be undertaken in the area; at 9:00 p.m. on October 2, Colonel Spear left Suffolk with 1,300 soldiers, one Artillery section, and orders to survey Franklin and determine the extent of the Confederate forces south of Suffolk. ===Attack=== (1861–65 on the Pamunkey River) Undated photo of the and her crew (1864) The evening of 2 October, Confederate pickets observed the three riverboats waiting around South Quay, Virginia, approximately downriver from Franklin. At 5:45 a.m. the next day, the three ships began moving towards the city while shelling the nearby banks. The attack was led by the Commodore Perry, followed by the Whitehead astern the Hunchback. While the Union shelled the banks of the Blackwater, Confederate troops began distributing themselves along the riverside to take advantage of the concealment there. Some of the 4th North Carolina Cavalry was dismounted and taken up by Colonel Marshall of the 52nd, and positioned along with his men at Crumpler's and neighboring bluffs to fire upon the riverboats. Colonel Ferebee took the rest of the 4th NC Cavalry and dismounted and positioned them behind the trees and bushes along the banks of the Blackwater, under the command of a Lieutenant Ruffin. According to a Union naval officer later, the Confederate's forces along the Blackwater also included \\"some nonuniformed irregulars and even 'some negroes. At 7:00 a.m., approximately from Franklin, the Commodore Perry came under fire from the Confederate forces along the river and atop the bluffs. As the Perry was too close to bring her large-bore guns to bear, Commander Flusser ordered his sailors to shelter themselves as best they could while the ship tried to steam past the enemy. Unfortunately, due to the narrowness of the bend, the Commodore Perry ran aground; Lt. Ruffin and his men were so close to the grounded riverboat, they later claimed to have heard the Perrys officers cursing her enlisted sailors. Freeing herself, the Perry rounded the bend and maneuvered to provide suppressive fire to allow the Hunchback and Whitehead to follow; the combined shelling of all three ships forced Lt. Ruffin and his detachment to withdraw from the banks of the river. However, all three ships' progress was soon halted by a barricade in the river. While the barricade was removable with Commander Flusser's available manpower, he could not attempt to do so due to the \\"terrible fire to which [they] were exposed.\\" While continuing to assault the Confederacy with their \\"IX-inch grape and shell\\" guns, \\"32-pounder\\" guns, field gun, and muskets, the three ships waited at the barricade hoping to hear the gunfire of General Dix's infantry forces. At 10:15 a.m., Commander Flusser ordered retreat from the river barrier. All three ships remained under heavy fire by enemy forces from multiple angles until between 2:30 and 3:30 p.m. An incomplete rear barricade of felled trees failed to stop the ships which \\"[pushed through] with a heavy head of steam.\\" Flusser later opined that this new barricade would have been impassable had the ships remained north of it for several more hours, waiting for General Dix's quiescent forces. Meanwhile, Colonel Spear arrived around 1:00 p.m. and anticipating support from the now-retreating naval gunships, the Union infantrymen conflicted with the Confederates in Franklin. After six hours of combat, running low on ammunition, realizing that he only had 1,300 men and not the 1,700-2,000 he'd thought, and losing two riflemen to Confederate defection, Spear withdrew the Union forces around Franklin, and returned to Suffolk abandoning one brass field piece, a few overcoats, and a horse. ===Aftermath=== Upon return to Ablemarle Sound, Commander Flusser sent the Hunchback on to Plymouth to bury their dead sailors; at Roanoke Island, Flusser was lent the to carry the wounded to Norfolk Hospital. ==Outcome== The Confederate forces around Franklin held back the Navy and ultimately forced them, and the Army reconnaissance team, to retreat. While the Union Navy lost no ships, they suffered four casualties and 15 wounded; the Army suffered one fatality and six wounded, although General Dix believed the infantry to have robbed the enemy of 70-100 in return. For the Confederates, this was the 4th NC Cavalry's first combat action of the war, and gave Colonel Ferebee and his men confidence in their abilities; they and the other Confederate forces in Franklin spent the rest of October 1862 surveilling the Union forces across the river. After the Union shelling, most of Franklin's civilians left the town, leaving it in the hands of the Confederate soldiers there; they did not return until after the April 1865 surrender of General Lee. The Joint Expedition has been described as the only fighting of significance to occur in Southampton County, Virginia during the war. For their distinguished services in the battle, Union servicemen Thomas Barton, John Breen, James H. Burbank, Daniel Lakin, Alfred Peterson, Edwin Smith, and John Williams were all awarded the Medal of Honor. In his summation of the Joint Expedition Against Franklin, Acting Rear-Admiral Lee said, \\"The Department will perceive that Lieutenant- Commander Flusser (senior officer present) displayed his usual gallantry, and that the officers and crews of the three gunboats did their parts well, under very trying and difficult circumstances.\\" In his After Action Report to Admiral Lee of , Lieutenant Commander Flusser described his losses as heavy and opined that it was \\"folly to fight these people on the banks, where they have every advantage\\", and that he could not be of any further service to the Army forces. In the aftermath of the failed mission, both Navy and Army flag officers implied that the cause was attempting to cooperate with the respective sister service. Admiral Lee wrote to Naval Secretary Gideon Welles that \\"where the situation does not allow [...] gunboats to take care of themselves, they can not assist the army.\\" Further, General Peck wrote to General Dix saying, \\"there is great uncertainty in operations with gunboats.\\" ==References== 1988 sign noting the occurrence of several Civil War skirmishes around Franklin in 1862 and 1863 Category:1862 in the American Civil War Category:1862 in Virginia Category:battles of the American Civil War in Virginia Category:battles of the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War Category:Confederate victories of the American Civil War Category:Franklin, Virginia Category:Isle of Wight County, Virginia Franklin Category:October 1862 events Category:riverine warfare Category:Southampton County, Virginia ","title":"Joint Expedition Against Franklin"},{"id":"7822393","text":"The Tennessee Valley Divide is the boundary of the drainage basin of the Tennessee River and its tributaries. The Tennessee River drainage basin begins with its tributaries in southwestern Virginia and flows generally west to the confluence of the Tennessee with the Ohio River at Paducah, Kentucky. The Tennessee Valley Divide forms a loop surrounding the drainage basin, beginning and ending at the river's mouth in Paducah. Following the Divide in a clockwise direction, it leads east and southeast through western Kentucky through the Land Between the Lakes, a narrow area between the Tennessee River and Cumberland River, then passes into Tennessee, where it continues southeast, passing south of the Nashville Basin on top of Duck River Ridge. Turning more to the east, the Divide climbs onto the low plateau of The Barrens, and then onto the higher Cumberland Plateau. The Divide turns northeast along the crest of the Cumberland Plateau, then follows the ridgecrest of Cumberland Mountain northeast to Cumberland Gap, at the junction of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia. The Divide continues northeast along the Kentucky-Virginia border, first following Cumberland Mountain, then Little Black and Black Mountain, after which it turns east into Virginia. The Divide follows the crest of Sandy Ridge northeast until it briefly touches the West Virginia border, then turn southeast near Tazewell, Virginia. From there, the divide follows an irregular line towards the south. In this area of southwestern Virginia, the divide forms the boundary between the drainage of the Tennessee River and the New River, which also flows to the Ohio River. Near Blowing Rock, North Carolina, the divide meets the Eastern Continental Divide in the Blue Ridge Mountains. This point forms a triple point between the streams draining west to the Tennessee, north to the New River, and east to the coastal rivers of North Carolina. From Blowing Rock, the Tennessee Valley Divide coincides with the Eastern Continental Divide, to another triple point in northern Georgia, from which point streams flow northwards towards the Tennessee River, eastwards to the Atlantic coast of Georgia, and southwards towards the Gulf of Mexico. From there, the Tennessee Valley Divide trends generally westward, dividing the Tennessee Valley in Alabama from the generally southward-flowing rivers of Alabama and Mississippi. Some of those rivers, such as the Tombigbee River, have their headwaters remarkably close to the Tennessee River. The divide then turns north and ends at the foot of Broadway in downtown Paducah, Kentucky, which also marks Mile 0 of the Tennessee River at its confluence with the Ohio. The divide passes through or touches the states of West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky. ==References== There are 3 GNIS entries for the Tennessee Valley Divide, with coordinates: * (Most locations) * (Georgia) * (North Carolina) Category:Drainage divides Category:Tennessee River Category:Geography of the United States ","title":"Tennessee Valley Divide"},{"id":"7822419","text":"Charles Wesley Pitman (died June 8, 1871) was a Whig member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania.

Hunting with hounds in the traditional manner became unlawful in Scotland in 2002 and in England and Wales in 2005, but continues in certain accepted forms. Traditional foxhunting continues in Northern Ireland. Following a trail (similar to drag hunting) rather than a live quarry has subsequently grown in importance in Great Britain, as has hunting foxes with a bird of prey. The British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) says that over a million people a year participate in shooting, including game shooting, clay shooting and target shooting. In 2005 it became unlawful in England and Wales to shoot game birds while they are not in flight, an action which has long been considered unsporting. To undertake shooting in the UK a valid firearms licence and insurance is required. ==History== \\"The Setting Dogg & Partridgs\\" (detail) by alt= Hunting has been practised in Britain since prehistoric times; it was a crucial activity of hunter-gatherer societies before the domestication of animals and the dawn of agriculture. During the last ice age, humans and neanderthals hunted mammoths and woolly rhinoceroses by driving them over cliffs; evidence has been found at La Cotte de St Brelade on the island of Jersey. In Britain, hunting with hounds was popular in Celtic Britain before the Romans arrived, using the Agassaei breed. The Romans brought their Castorian and Fulpine hound breeds to England, along with importing the brown hare (the mountain hare is native) and fallow deer as quarry. Wild boar was also hunted. The earliest known attempt to specifically hunt a fox with hounds was in Norfolk, in the East of England, in 1534, where farmers began chasing down foxes with their dogs as a form of pest control. Packs of hounds were first trained specifically to hunt foxes in the late 17th century, with the oldest such fox hunt likely to be the Bilsdale in Yorkshire.Ridley, Jane (Oct 1990), Fox Hunting (HarperCollins) By the end of the 17th century, many organised packs were hunting both hare and fox. Shotguns were improved during the 18th and 19th centuries and game shooting became more popular. To protect the pheasants for the shooters, gamekeepers culled competitive species such as foxes, magpies and birds of prey almost to extirpation in popular areas, and landowners improved their coverts and other habitats for game. Game Laws were relaxed in 1831 which meant anyone could obtain a permit to shoot rabbits, hares, and gamebirds, although shooting and taking away any birds or animals on someone else's land without their permission continued to be the crime of poaching, as it still is. Hunting was formerly a royal sport, and to an extent shooting still is, with many Kings and Queens being involved in hunting and shooting, including King Edward VII, King George V (who on 18 December 1913 shot over a thousand pheasants out of a total bag of 3937), King George VI and the present day Prince Philip, although Queen Elizabeth II does not shoot. Shooting on the large estates of Scotland has always been a fashionable country sport. This trend is generally attributed to the Victorians, who were inspired by the romantic imagery of the Scottish Highlands. ==Forms of hunting and shooting== ===Equipment=== Since the mid-18th century game keepers and hunters kept gamebooks for recording game and vermin killed on country estates, farms, etc.https://www.shootinguk.co.uk/features/gamebooks-a-peep-into-the- past-1638https://www.fieldsportsmagazine.com/Shooting-Pheasants/bygone- gamebirds.html ===Shooting=== Snowden Slights with retriever and shotgun around 1910 'the last of Yorkshire's Wildfowlers' The shooting of game birds, in particular pheasant, is found in the UK, on large, traditional driven shoots on estates and on small-scale rough shoots. Shooting of game birds is carried out using a shotgun, most often 12 and 20 gauge or a .410 bore, often on land managed by a gamekeeper. Shooters are often referred to as \\"guns\\". Game birds are shot in different ways. In driven game shooting, where beaters are employed to walk through woods and over moors or fields, dependent on the quarry and time of year and drive game towards a line of 8–10 standing guns standing about 50 or 60 metres apart. The guns will be members of a syndicate sharing costs, or have paid in the region of £25+ per bird for pheasants and much more for grouse. The total bag (number of birds shot) will be anywhere between 10 and 400, again dependent on the budget and quarry. The day may be very formal, and the head gamekeeper or a shoot captain will oversee proceedings. Great emphasis is placed on safety. Pickers-up with dogs are also employed to make sure all shot or wounded game is collected. On such estates, large numbers of pheasants, partridge and duck, but not grouse, are reared and released to provide sufficient numbers of game. Grouse cannot be reared intensively but the heather moorland where they live is intensively managed to maximise numbers. Rough shooting, where several guns walk through a woodland, moor or field and shoot the birds their dogs put up, is increasingly popular. It is less formal and may be funded by several people grouping together to form a \\"syndicate\\", paying a certain amount each year towards pheasants, habitat maintenance, etc. Wildfowling is often a lonely and uncomfortable sport. A single gun sits in pursuit of wildfowl by a body of water, or on the coastal foreshore, often at dawn or dusk, and waits for birds to \\"flight\\" in. This is sometimes undertaken in total darkness or by the light of the moon. Duck are also shot by the two methods described above. Rook shooting was once popular in rural Britain for both pest control and gaining food, wherein juvenile rooks living in rookeries, known as \\"branchers\\", were shot before they were able to fly. These events were both very social and a source of food (the rook becomes inedible once mature) as the rook and rabbit pie was considered a great delicacy.Colin Greenwood, The classic British rook & rabbit rifle, The Crowood Press Ltd, Marlborough, 2006, . ===Deer stalking=== High- powered rifles are used for deer stalking. This may take place high on moors, or from a \\"high seat\\" in woodland. Venison is also a highly popular meat with sales quadrupling in the UK in 2014. ==Game animals== An English Springer Spaniel in a typical English shooting scene In the UK \\"game\\" is defined in law by the Game Act 1831. Other (non-game) birds that are hunted for food in the UK are specified under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. UK law defines game as including: { cellpadding=\\"2\\" - ! style=\\"width:150px;\\"Species ! style=\\"width:225px;\\"Season (England, Scotland and Wales) ! style=\\"width:225px;\\"Season (Northern Ireland) - Pheasant  1 October – 1 February  1 October – 31 January - Partridge, grey and red-legged  1 September – 1 February  1 September – 31 January - Black grouse  20 August – 10 December  N/A - Red grouse  12 August – 10 December  12 August – 30 November - Ptarmigan  12 August – 10 December  N/A - Brown hare  No closed season  12 August – 31 January } Although there is no close season for hare outside Northern Ireland, the Hare Preservation Act of 1892 makes it illegal to sell, or offer to sell, hare between 1 March and 31 July. Deer are not included in the definition, but similar controls provided to those in the Game Act apply to deer (from the Deer Act 1991). Deer hunted in the UK are: * Red deer * Roe deer * Fallow deer * Sika deer * Muntjac deer * Chinese water deer * Hybrids of these deer Other birds and mammals shot in the UK include: Ducks ** Mallard ** Wigeon ** Teal ** Shoveler ** Pintail ** Common pochard ** Common goldeneye ** Gadwall ** Tufted duck Geese ** Greylag goose ** Canada goose ** Pink-footed goose Other birds * Wood pigeon * Woodcock * Snipe * Golden plover Mammals * European rabbit ===Other=== The aforementioned species are those primarily pursued for game shooting. To this list can be added feral pigeon, jay, magpie, carrion crow, jackdaw and rook, which can be shot for the sole purposes of conservation, public health or safety or to prevent serious damage. Black grouse are no longer shot regularly, due to a continuing decline in numbers and those that are shot are most likely to be females mistaken for red grouse. Capercaillie are no longer shot in the UK, as they are now protected (Scotland only) due to a long-term decline in population. Eurasian coot and moorhen are also shot, but not as much as in the past; they have a closed season that follows the wildfowl season and are classed as game. ==Field sports and conservation in the United Kingdom== Mean ± SE numbers of birds recorded in 4 ha plots in woodlands managed for pheasants compared with unmanaged woodlands in southern England. * indicates statistically significant difference.

A study in 2003 showed that they are around 2.5-times more likely to plant new woodlands than landowners without game or hunting interests, and also conserve a far greater woodland area. These habitats are essential for the persistence of a wide range of other British wildlife, and consequently it has been suggested that field sports can provide valuable tools for wildlife conservation in the UK, without the need for governmental subsidies or protective legislation.

It was found that several declining species displayed significant population increases, suggesting that game management strategies may indeed play a major role in the conservation of wildlife in Britain, particularly threatened farmland passerines. Prior to the Hunting Act, fox hunting also provided a major incentive for woodland conservation and management throughout England and Wales, with higher species diversity and abundance of plants and butterflies found in woodlands managed for foxes according to a survey of mounted hunts in 2006, verified by The Council of Hunting Associations.Ewald JA, Callegari SE, Kingdon NG, Graham NA.

Officially titled Diocese of Singapore, Labuan and Sarawak in 1881, a diocese over such a large area was quite unmanageable. In 1909 Singapore was made a separate diocese covering the Straits Settlements, Peninsular Malaya, Siam, Java, Sumatra and adjacent islands, with Bishop Charles J. Ferguson-Davie as the first bishop of the diocese. On 6 February 1960, it was renamed to Diocese of Singapore and Malaya. On 8 April 1970, the diocese was dissolved and split into Diocese of Singapore and Diocese of West Malaysia. ==Parishes== As of 2018, there are 27 Anglican parishes in the diocese: *St Andrew's Cathedral *All Saints' Church *Chapel of Christ the King *Chapel of Christ the Redeemer *Chapel of the Holy Spirit *Chapel of the Resurrection *Church of Our Saviour *Church of the Ascension *Church of the Epiphany *Church of the Good Shepherd *Church of the True Light *Holy Trinity Parish *Light of Christ Church Woodlands *Marine Parade Christian Centre *My Saviour's Church *Parish of Christ Church (Tamil) *St Andrew’s City Church *St Andrew's Community Chapel *St George's Church *St Hilda's Church *St James' Church *St John's Chapel *St John's–St Margaret's Church *St Matthew's Church *St Paul's Church *St Peter's Church *Yishun Christian Church (Anglican) ==Deaneries== There are six deaneries in the Diocese of Singapore: *Cambodia *Laos *Indonesia *Nepal *Thailand *Vietnam A dean oversees the mission work in each deanery and regularly reports to the director of missions of the Diocese of Singapore. ==Schools== Anglican schools in Singapore: *Anglican High School *Christ Church Secondary School *Saint Hilda's Primary School *Saint Hilda's Secondary School *St. Margaret's Primary School *St. Margaret's Secondary School *Saint Andrew's Junior School *St. Andrew's Secondary School *St. Andrew's Junior College *St. Andrew's Autism School Additionally, there are five kindergartens and six childcare centres as of 2020: * Kindergartens * Ascension Kindergarten * Queenstown Good Shepherd Kindergarten * St. Hilda's Kindergarten * St. James' Church Kindergarten * St. Paul's Church Kindergarten * * Childcare Centres * Ascension Kindercare - A Little Seeds Preschool * Kiddy Ark Kindercare - A Little Seeds Preschool * Praiseland Kindercare - A Little Seeds Preschool * Sonshine Kindercare - A Little Seeds Preschool * St. Andrew's Kindercare - A Little Seeds Preschool * St. James' Kindercare - A Little Seeds Preschool * ==Medical services== St Andrew's Community Hospital, Simei The St Andrew's Mission Hospital (SAMH) is a non-profit voluntary welfare organisation under the Diocese of Singapore.

It was first published in 2006, and is the sequel to Friends, Lovers, Chocolate. ==Plot synopsis== Isabel Dalhousie is in her early forties and lives alone in a large ageing house in the south of Edinburgh. Due to an inheritance left to her by her late mother, she can work for a nominal fee as the editor of the Review of Applied Ethics. Her closest friends are her niece Cat, a young woman who runs a delicatessen; her housekeeper Grace, an outspoken woman with an interest in spiritualism; Cat's ex-boyfriend Jamie, a bassoonist to whom Isabel has been secretly attracted ever since they met; and Brother Fox, an urban fox who lives in Isabel's garden. When visiting an art gallery, Isabel meets an American couple: Isabel sees that the man has Bell's palsy, and takes an instant dislike to the woman for no reason that she can explain. Then she goes to Cat's delicatessen, where Cat's assistant Eddie tells her that Cat has a new boyfriend, Patrick, a workaholic lawyer. Isabel resolves not to judge him without meeting him. Isabel visits a flat that she is considering buying for Grace, who currently rents; Jamie accompanies her. Later, Isabel's agent calls to tell her that she has been offered the flat because the owner, Florence, has assumed that Isabel and Jamie will live in it together as a couple. Isabel calls back to correct the mistake, but when Florence hears that Isabel is buying the flat for Grace, she offers it to her anyway. Isabel's cousins Mimi and Joe visit from Dallas. Mimi tells Isabel that some friends from Texas – Tom Bruce and his fiancée Angie – own a house in Peebles, and that Mimi, Joe and Isabel have been invited to spend the weekend with them. When Mimi says that Tom suffers from Bell's palsy, Isabel realises that he is the man she saw in the art gallery, and Mimi confirms Isabel's negative impressions of Angie: most of Tom's friends think that Angie is marrying him for his money. Isabel goes to visit Jamie at his flat. As she is examining one of his bassoon reeds, he kisses her, but pulls away after a few moments and says that it was a stupid mistake. The next day, Mimi reveals that Isabel's mother had an affair with a younger man, and Isabel is shocked. When Mimi suggests that Isabel invite Tom and Angie to dinner before the weekend away, Isabel also invites Jamie. Isabel likes Tom instantly, but still dislikes Angie, especially when Angie flirts with Jamie and invites him to form part of the weekend party. Isabel wonders if perhaps Jamie is more suited to a younger woman like Angie, but is surprised (and reassured) when Grace announces that it is obvious that Isabel and Jamie are in love with each other. Mimi agrees that this is how it seems. A few days later, Isabel meets Patrick's mother, Cynthia, who tries to enlist Isabel's help in breaking up Cat and Patrick so that Patrick can focus on his career. Isabel refuses, but suspects that Patrick will choose his mother over Cat; and he does. At Tom and Angie's house, Isabel and Jamie discover that they have been given adjoining rooms. Again Angie flirts with Jamie and Isabel is sure that she does not love Tom. That evening, Isabel summons up the courage to ask Jamie if he wants to sleep with her. He admits that he does, and they return to their rooms and make love. When Isabel and Jamie return from Peebles, Cat finds out that they have slept together and is furious with Isabel. As Isabel sits at home feeling guilty, Tom comes to visit and says that he doesn't think Angie loves him. Isabel tells him to end the engagement, and, if Angie refuses to give up the chance at Tom's fortune, to pay her off now. Later, Mimi announces that Tom and Angie have split up, but says that Angie refused to take any money. However, after Mimi and Joe return to Texas, someone sets fire to Tom's Dallas house (although Tom is unharmed). Cat writes to apologise to Isabel for being angry with her, and Isabel feels that with time Cat will accept the idea of her and Jamie. This comes as a particular relief to Isabel, who that evening tells Jamie that she is pregnant with his child. ==Development== The Right Attitude to Rain presents the culmination of a relationship that had been suggested since the first appearance of Isabel and Jamie in The Sunday Philosophy Club. McCall Smith admits that there has always been \\"tension\\" and \\"affection\\" between the two characters but was originally unsure of whether to develop their friendship into a sexual relationship: \\"I think that’s something one would have to handle very carefully because ... Isabel has a very real sense of what can be and what can’t be. Some people have said to me, ‘Oh, why don’t you make that develop,’ but I'm not sure whether in real life it would develop.\\" http://www.sarahweinman.com/confessions/2004/10/the_idiosyncrat.html McCall Smith also found that the unfulfilled nature of the relationship was good for the novel, commenting that \\"Erotic tension is much sexier than fulfilment\\" and that reading about other people not getting what they want is interesting because \\"It's the story of all our lives.\\" https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2005/11/28/AR2005112801898.html The decision to change the direction of Isabel and Jamie’s relationship was partly due to pressure from fans.http://jam.canoe.ca/Books/2006/10/03/1941693.html ==Reception== The Right Attitude to Rain generally received more positive reviews than its predecessors. EW.com is pleased by the development of Isabel's relationship, commenting \\"Hurray! An Alexander McCall Smith heroine finally gets some\\" and adding that \\"This affair is a welcome break from the tea sipping and moral hair-splitting that have made McCall Smith's recent novels such effective sleep aids.\\"http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1535152,00.html BookReporter.com agrees that this is the most interesting aspect of the novel, saying, \\"For the first time Alexander McCall Smith fleshes out this eccentric and delightful woman\\". They also commend the philosophical material: \\"Isabel's quandaries delight and pique the inner philosopher in all of us.\\"http://www.bookreporter.com/reviews2/0375423001.asp InTheNews.com disagrees, saying that \\"the interjections of philosophical and high-brow intellectual reasoning ... can seem snobbish and isolating to the average reader, ie those without a PhD.\\" However, it says that the novel is \\"packed full of quirky characters, feel-good moments and beautiful settings\\" and summarises it as: \\"Thoughtful.

It was named after King Oscar II. The salon accommodated 1175 seats and was decorated with white stucco and gilded ornaments. Between 1971-1974, the theater was closed for renovation and at the same time the salon was restored. The opening production was Frihetsbröderna (Les brigands) by Jacques Offenbach, on 6 December the same year. The theatre has during the years been seen as the foremost stage for musical productions and operettas in Sweden. The theatre has 905 seats and for many years in the early 20th century was part of theatre empire of Albert Ranft (1858-1938). Over the years it has boasted some great musical productions, including several successful stagings of My Fair Lady (the 1959-61 run reaching 766 performances) and the 1989-95 run of The Phantom of the Opera (performed 1173 times). Opera soprano singer Rosa Grünberg (1878–1960) made her play stage debut. The original Swedish (and European) staging of Nine in 1983 is also among the most successful - and critically acclaimed - productions in the theatre's history. The theatre was managed from its inception until 1926 by Albert Ranft; from 1926 to 1947 by Gösta Ekman (1890–1938) and Pauline Brunius (1881–1954) among others. It was used in this period solely as a stage for spoken drama. From 1947 to 1998 it was managed by Sandrew Metronome, during a period often described as the theatre's \\"golden days\\" in terms of musical theatre shows. In 1998 it has been managed by Vicky von der Lancken and since 2004, by 2 Entertain production company.

Hosted and narrated by William Shatner, known for his portrayal of Captain James T. Kirk, and based on his book, I'm Working on That, the show focuses on technological advancements and people in the real world that were inspired by the Star Trek phenomenon. ==Summary== ===First hour=== The first hour focuses on the original Star Trek series and the ideas that Gene Roddenberry had about the future of space travel. It begins with the life of Dr. Marc D. Rayman, the chief propulsion engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and shows how Dr. Rayman became interested in propulsion through Star Trek. It also discusses how NASA's newest deep space probe's ion propulsion was inspired by the Star Trek episode \\"Spock's Brain\\". Shatner also states that \\"those pesky trekkies are everywhere in the space program,\\" hence the name for the first Space Shuttle: Enterprise. The show then examines the life of Martin Cooper, the chief engineer at Motorola, who invented the cell phone. Cooper states that Star Trek was his inspiration for the cell phone, and discusses the similarities between the modern day cell phone and a Star Trek communicator. He also discusses how Star Trek introduced the concept of computer voice recognition dialing. Next, Mae C. Jemison describes how Star Trek inspired her to become the first African-American in space, and Seth Shostak, of SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence), tells how it led him to astronomy. The show also explores how Star Trek popularized the notion of the user-friendly personal computer, and how Trek fan Ed Roberts, invented the first home computer, the Altair 8800, named after the solar system Altair (Altair 6) in the Star Trek episode \\"Amok Time\\". This led to Bill Gates writing the computer programming language BASIC for the Altair and forming Microsoft. Medical technologies are discussed, in particular the inspiration for non-invasive Star-Trek-style imaging technology. Warp drive and faster- than-light interstellar travel with theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre's theories are mentioned. Lawrence M. Krauss, physicist and author of The Physics of Star Trek, is also featured. The show then investigates the research work of Kevin Warwick at the University of Reading and considers its links with the Borg. Warwick's cyborg implants, linking his own nervous system into the internet, are featured. ===Second hour=== The second hour focuses on further programs in Star Trek franchise: Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise and their impact and how they differed from the original series. Next up is Steve Perlman, at the time principal scientist at Apple Computer, who was inspired to invent the QuickTime media player by watching an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Filmed mostly in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the special featured some scenes that took place in locations shown in Star Trek TV series. ==Awards== The special was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 2006 - Outstanding Nonfiction Special, and Outstanding Writing For Nonfiction Programming.https://web.archive.org/web/20060715113531/http://emmys.org/downloads/images/2006emmys/PrimetimeNoms.php ==References== ==External links== * Discovery Channel Canada * MemoryAlpha: How William Shatner Changed the World * * TechHui Geek link Category:2005 television films Category:2005 films Category:Canadian documentary television films Category:History (American TV channel) original programming Category:Documentary films about Star Trek Category:Canadian films ","title":"How William Shatner Changed the World"},{"id":"7822807","text":"Bogdan Śliwa (4 February 1922 in Kraków - 16 May 2003) was a Polish chess master.

He studied in Johannesburg in the 1970s and was associated with conceptual art and the emergence of an indigenous experimental music aesthetic. In 1976 he embarked on 'African Journal', a series of pieces for Western instruments that drew on his studies of traditional African music (Muller 2011, 71-92) and aesthetics, which continued to expand during two decades in London until he returned to South Africa in 1998. From around 2000 African music becomes less explicit on the surface of his compositions, but elements of rhythm and repetition remain as part of a more postcolonial engagement with material and form. He works in a range of styles including minimalism and collage, and now also forages for source material from the entire musical canon. == Biography == Michael Blake was born in Cape Town. He took piano lessons at the South African College of Music from the age of 9, and began composing soon afterwards. In 1970 he registered for a Bachelor of Music degree at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg studying composition with June Schneider and Klaas van Oostveen, and piano with Adolph Hallis. In 1976 he attended summer courses in Darmstadt and Dartington, and met Mauricio Kagel, Peter Maxwell Davies and Stanley Glasser. In 1977 he launched a New Music concert series at the newly-opened Market Theatre in Johannesburg with his ensemble Moonchild. Later that year he left South Africa to avoid being drafted into South Africa’s border war, and for the next 2 years studied for a Master of Music degree in music theory and analysis at the University of London Goldsmiths College. He was part-time lecturer at Goldsmiths College, where he founded and conducted the Goldsmiths Contemporary Music Ensemble. From 1979 to 1986 he was the keyboard player in the electroacoustic group Metanoia which he co-directed with Jonathan Impett. In 1986 he founded the ensemble London New Music for the performance of experimental music, and the group gave regular concerts at the South Bank, Institute for Contemporary Arts and elsewhere. London New Music undertook British Council-sponsored tours in Europe, and broadcast regularly for BBC Radio 3 and European radio stations, premiering new work commissioned by Blake from his contemporaries — Gerald Barry, Matteo Fargion, Christopher Fox, Chris Newman, Howard Skempton, Kevin Volans — as well as playing non-mainstream ('downtown') composers he considered important — Henry Cowell, Ruth Crawford Seeger, Charles Ives, Stefan Wolpe, John Cage, Morton Feldman, Bunita Marcus, Barbara Monk, Christian Wolff and Walter Zimmermann. All of these ensembles also regularly played his own compositions. At the beginning of 1998, he moved back to South Africa and settled in Grahamstown where he taught composition at Rhodes University and established the (now) annual contemporary music festival, the New Music Indaba and was its artistic director from 2000 to 2006. At the 1999 meeting of the International Society for Contemporary Music held in Bucharest, Blake made a successful bid for South Africa's re-entry into the ISCM after an absence of nearly four decades, and was President of the ISCM South African Section, NewMusicSA, for six years. From 2002-2009 he curated The Bow Project. He taught composition at the University of South Africa between 2007-2009, established the Sterkfontein Composers Meeting in 2012, and is Honorary Professor of Experimental Composition in the Africa Open Institute for Music, Research and Innovation at Stellenbosch University. == Early work == Having received a very traditional music education at school, he immediately immersed himself in the more radical music of the twentieth century when he started his undergraduate studies, learning and performing piano works by Webern, Schoenberg, Messiaen, Stockhausen, Cage, Ives and Cardew, and discovering Dada, conceptual art, and experimental and minimalist music. As a result his compositions from this time show many of these tendencies, for example: A Little Fantasy (1971) for two pianists, metronomes, piano movers and lighting is an indeterminist piece in the form of a kit; Five Pieces for Piccolo and Tuba (1971) is a graphic score which moves between recognizable music notation and abstract art; Quodlibet for Charles Ives (1974), a reworking of In the Inn in which the original American music quotations are literally pasted over with fragments of Cape Malay tunes; and a series somewhat akin to Mauricio Kagel’s ‘Conversations with Chamber Music, for example song without words (1975) for cello and piano, which deconstructs music by Mendelssohn. == African journal == Growing up in Cape Town, Blake was familiar with the music of the Cape Malay choirs and Christmas bands, but only really became aware of African music when he was studying in Johannesburg and eventually met Andrew Tracey. So from the mid-1970s his musical language was partly the result of an immersion in the materials and playing techniques of African music His first mbira-based piece, for harpsichord, was written as the soundtrack of a 1976 tv documentary about African weaving, and during the following two decades that he was based in London, it was followed by pieces for string quartet, a variety of chamber ensembles, keyboard solo and duo, solo instruments, orchestra and choir, culminating in San Polyphony for organ (1998/2006), his first commission after settling back in South Africa in 1998. Several of these have become his most performed pieces, in particular Let us run out of the rain (1986) and French Suite (1994). Martin Scherzinger has described these as \\"understated translations of African music into Western idioms [that] deftly negotiate the borderline between quotation and abstraction, and, in the process, interrogate the opposition between the two\\" (Scherzinger 2004). Alongside ‘African Journal’, there were also pieces which drew on other music, for example: Bach (…ode-cantata…, 1980), or Art Tatum and Fats Waller (Two Studies for Prepared Piano, 1983), or Cole Porter (Nightsongs, 1997). == Postcolonial narratives == Since 2000, Michael Blake's work has taken something of a new direction and revealed a postmodern sensibility. This watershed in Blake's life is exemplified in two works: String Quartet No 1, written for his long-standing friends and collaborators the Fitzwilliam String Quartet in 2001 and premiered in Cambridge for Blake's 50th birthday celebrations, and Ways to put in the salt, an uncompromisingly stark interpretation of musical bow harmonics written in 2002 for John Tilbury. In these and other works that followed, an African sensibility is subsumed into the fractured narratives that have become a feature of his recent work, such as the Piano Concerto (2007), Piano Sonata ‘Choral’ (2008), and Postcolonial Song (2009). A passion for unusual timbres and instrumental combinations saw the realisation of two more commissioned works in 2007: Shoowa Panel for vibraphone and marimba (premiered in South Africa) and Rural Arias for singing saw and eleven players (premiered in Vienna). A composer who thinks on his feet and perhaps more than anyone approaches Adorno's notion of a 'musique informelle', Blake draws as much on the visual arts of Africa and the West — African weaving, abstract painting, underground cinema, silent films — as he does on African musics and American and English experimental music aesthetics. == Discography == * Damba Moon: Let us run out of the rain (Ensemble Bash, CD, Sound Circus, 2001) * Piano Music 1994-2004 (Jill Richards, CD, MBED Records, 2008) * String Quartets 1 and 2; Piano Quintet 'Homage to Schumann' (Fitzwillian Quartet, CD, MBED Records, 2012) * The Bow Project: String Quartet No 3 'Nofinishi' (Nightingale String Quartet, CD, TUTL, 2012) * The Philosophy of Composition (Friedrich Gauwerky and Daan Vandewalle, CD WERGO, 2018) == Filmography == * Untitled by Aryan Kaganof (Robert Pickup, Jill Richards, DVD, African Noise Foundation, 2005) * Music Videos by Aryan Kaganof and Michael Blake (Jill Richards, DVD, African Noise Foundation, 2007-2010) == Selected compositions == ===Stage=== * Searching for Salome (2004-9) Opera in 7 scenes for soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto, 2 countertenors, tenor, 2 baritones, bass, dancer, clarinet in Bb, bassoon, trumpet in C, tuba, percussion (1 player), pianola (disklavier ad lib), violin, viola, electronic tape and video ===Orchestra=== * Kwela (1992) First version: string orchestra, Second version: elastic scoring * Brandenburg Floor Plan (2003) for baroque orchestra * Gautango (2007) for harp and strings * Symphony 'From the Third World' (2010) * Let the Good Times Roll!

After a People's Republican Party government is elected by the British people, who were influenced by subliminal messages sent through their TV sets by members of the television technicians' union manipulated by Jack Barker, the Royal Family has to leave Buckingham Palace and must move to a council estate. Barker, as the new Prime Minister, transforms Britain into a republic and dismantles the monarchy. In Hellebore Close (aptly known as \\"Hell Close\\" to its longtime residents), the new home of the Royal Family, they learn to cope with the normal day of ordinary people. The Queen – now called Mrs. Windsor – is not allowed to take all her beloved corgis to her new home in \\"Hell Close\\", with only Harris with her, and Charles learning that horses cannot be kept in a council house garden. The Queen is visited by a social worker, but refuses to let her in. She learns how to use a zip and buttons, and that five hours of waiting to see a doctor in an ordinary hospital is not unusual. The Queen learns that living on a small pensioner's income is difficult, and that she must organise her budget to fit. Nonetheless, the Queen quickly learns to cope with the situation, and later does not wish to return to Buckingham Palace due to the duties that would await her there, should she return to her former royal status. Her husband, Prince Philip, conversely struggles with the situation, refusing to eat, share a bed with his wife, and wishing that he were anywhere but in Hellebore Close. Charles, former Prince of Wales, discovers his great love for gardening. While he and his wife Diana, Princess of Wales, begin affairs with their neighbours, their children, William and Harry, do not recognise the situation they are in, thinking the whole thing to be an adventure. Later, Charles is imprisoned and sentenced for attacking a police officer, a crime he did not actually commit. His sister, Princess Anne takes up with a local handyman. Prince Andrew, Duke of York, is briefly mentioned to be serving aboard a Royal Navy submarine under the Arctic ice cap. Their neighbours, who are at first sceptical, eventually include the ex-royal family in their community, and help them as much as their own circumstances allow. Although the Queen Mother is the oldest of the ex-royals, she learns very fast how to cope with the new situation, but even in the poor circumstances of Hellebore Close, cannot stop herself from betting on horses. Her death shakes the whole neighbourhood and everyone takes part in her cheap but solemn funeral. A disgruntled fishmonger and his wife start a campaign to \\"Bring Our Monarch Back\\", under the acronym 'B.O.M.B'. Jack Barker and his so-called \\"Kitchen Cabinet\\" make election promises to voters that would cause great expense, such as promising to raise pensions and renew schools, and soon get into trouble with foreign creditors. After talks with the Japanese Emperor, Barker announces that Britain is to become part of the Japanese Empire, with himself as Governor General. In return, all repayments to Japan are suspended indefinitely. This agreement is sealed by the marriage of the Emperor's daughter to Edward, the Queen's youngest son. It is then revealed that the whole story was a nightmare. The Queen wakes to find that the Conservatives have won the election instead, as indeed actually happened, and John Major has remained Prime Minister. In 2006, a sequel, Queen Camilla, was published. The novel ignores the revelation that Hellebore Close was all a dream, and depicts the royal family as still living there, with Jack Barker still in power. ==Characters== ===Royal Family=== * Queen Elizabeth II * Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh * Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother * Prince Charles, Prince of Wales * Diana, Princess of Wales * Prince William of Wales * Prince Harry of Wales * Princess Anne, Princess Royal * Peter Phillips * Zara Phillips * Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.

It sits on the highest point in the St. Clairsville area and is thus visible from Interstate 70 and many other points in the Ohio Valley. It is a contributing property in the St. Clairsville Historic District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. ==History== Belmont County was created in 1801, and organized in 1815. The county seat was Pultney, now called Shadyside. This courthouse was a simple two-story brick building, and was only used for a few years until the county seat was removed to the more central St. Clairsville. St. Clairsville was a developing community along the National Road and the courthouse was planned along this road. The courthouse constructed in 1805 was a log structure standing two stories high. It cost the county just over $1,000. When this building was destroyed, a new courthouse rose from its site. This new building was made of brick in the popular Federal style in 1815. The new courthouse stood two stories high and had long rectangular windows lining the facade. A cupola rose from the pitched roof. This courthouse served the county until 1885. The new courthouse built between 1885–1888 was designed by noted Ohio (and later New York) architect, Joseph W. Yost, who also designed the similar Miami County Courthouse built at the same time in Troy as well as six other Ohio courthouses. The three-floor Second Empire building hosts many county functions. It contains three courtrooms, the county commission meeting room, and offices for county officials. ==Exterior== The courthouse in 1891 ===The courthouse=== The three-story building is constructed of rusticated sandstone blocks with high arched windows. The building is rectangular with a central projection housing the entrance. The stairs once led to the main entrance, but due to security measures the building is now entered through a tunnel under the stairs. Above the stairs is a false balcony supported by Corinthian columns. A pair of arched windows are flanked by a set of Corinthian pilasters supporting a pediment and a frieze bearing the year \\"1886\\" in the center with a fanlight above. The central projection is topped with a pediment with a circle light framed by a carved wreath of flags. Standing guard over the entrance is a statue of Justice. The rest of the facade on either side of the central projection is symmetrical, with three arched windows on each floor and out-thrust corners. The corner projections contain a single arched window with Doric pilasters on the second floor and Corinthian pilasters on the third. The corners are topped by a pediment with a tower which contains Doric pilasters and arched pediments. The top of each tower is crowned with an urn. A central tower housing a clock tower and dome rises from the mansard roof. The tower contains high arched windows, Corinthian pilasters, and a small lantern. A steel bell weighing 3,800 pounds once hung from the tower but was taken down during restoration and now rests in front of the courthouse. It rang continuously for an hour in 1945 to celebrate the end of World War II. ===Grounds=== A memorial stands to the right of the building in honor of the veterans who served in various wars. The courthouse tower bell sits in the northern courtyard and the bicentennial bell sits in the southern courtyard. A brick building to the right used to house local government, but now houses one of many sheriff's posts. The southern portion of the lot consists of a series of stairs with the main landing the site of the local farmers' market in the summer and the public Christmas tree in the winter. ==Interior== The interior first floor corridors are lined in tile mosaic forming geometric shapes. The courtrooms and county offices have been refitted with modern conveniences, like an elevator, central air and heating, as well as weather-proof windows. A new metal detector purchased on a state grant protects the many county employees within. The second floor used to be the main floor and shows evidence of this past. In the atrium is an information desk, staffed during business hours. The deed office is located down the hall. The third floor contains the since covered dome, now illuminated by surrounding lights. This floor also houses the courtrooms. When the courthouse first opened there were three courtrooms, but the third has since been converted into the county law library. An attic above cannot be easily accessed and houses the old bell tower and the protruding hump of the dome.

His teacher there in the Talmud was Meïr Wärters (d. 1693); and Loeb Shir ha- Shirim instructed him in singing. He was appointed bass singer in the celebrated Altneuschule of Prague, being called, from his position, \\"Bass,\\" or \\"Bassista,\\" or \\"Meshorer.\\" His leisure time he devoted to literary pursuits, more especially to improving the instruction of the young. ===As printer=== Between 1674 and 1679 Bass traveled through Poland, Germany, and the Dutch Republic, stopping in such cities as Głogów, Kalisz, Krotoszyn, Leszno, Poznań, Worms, and Amsterdam, the centers of Jewish scholarship. He finally settled at Amsterdam in 1679, where he entered into friendly and scholarly relations with the eminent men of the German and the Portuguese-Spanish communities. That city was the center of Jewish printing and publishing, and Bass, becoming thoroughly familiar with the business, resolved to devote himself entirely to issuing Jewish books. With a keen eye for the practical, he perceived that the eastern part of Germany was a suitable place for a Jewish printing establishment. The literary productivity of the Lithuanian- Polish Jews was at this time obliged to seek an outlet in Amsterdam or Prague almost exclusively; Bass accordingly fixed upon Breslau as a suitable place for his purposes, on account of its vicinity to the Polish frontier, and of the large commerce carried on between Breslau and Poland. Hence, after a residence of five years, he left Amsterdam; going first, it seems, to Vienna, in order to obtain a license from the imperial government. The negotiations between Bass and the magistrates of Breslau occupied nearly four years, and not until 1687 or 1688 did he receive permission to set up a Hebrew printing- press. ===At Dyhernfurth=== Thereupon he settled at Dyhernfurth, a small town near Breslau founded shortly before 1663, whose owner, Herr von Glaubitz, glad to have a large establishment on his estate, was very well disposed toward Bass. In order the more easily to obtain Jewish workmen, Bass united into a congregation the small band of printers, typesetters, and workmen who had followed him to Dyhernfurth, for whose needs he cared, acquiring as early as 1689 a place for a cemetery. The first book from Bass's press appeared in the middle of August, 1689, the first customer being, as he had anticipated, a Polish scholar, Rabbi Samuel ben Uri of Waydyslav, whose commentary Beit Shmuel on Shulchen Aruch, Even Ha'ezer , was printed at Dyhernfurth. The books that followed during the next year were either works of Polish scholars or liturgical collections intended for the use of Polish Jews. Being issued in a correct, neat, and pleasing form, they easily found buyers, especially at the fairs of Breslau, where Bass himself sold his books. But the ill-will against Jews, apparent since 1697 in Silesia, and especially at Breslau, greatly injured Bass's establishment; he was himself forbidden to stay in Breslau (July 20, 1706). Another stroke of misfortune was the partial destruction of his establishment by fire in 1708. To this were added domestic difficulties. When an old man he had married a second time, to the great dissatisfaction of his family and neighbors, his wife being a young girl. He finally transferred his business to his only son, Joseph, in 1711. His trials culminated in his sudden arrest, April 13, 1712, on the charge of having spread abroad incendiary speeches against all divine and civic government. The Jesuits, who looked with an evil eye upon Bass's undertaking, had endeavored, in a letter to the magistrate of Breslau, as early as July 15, 1694, to have the sale of Hebrew books interdicted, on the ground that such works contained \\"blasphemous and irreligious words\\"; and they had succeeded. As the magistrate saw, however, that the confiscated books contained no objectionable matter, they were restored to Bass. In 1712 the Jesuit father Franz Kolb, teacher of Hebrew at the University of Prague, succeeded in having Bass and his son Joseph arrested, and their books confiscated. The innocent little book of devotions, Nathan Hannover's Sha'are Zion (Gates of Zion), which Bass reprinted after it had already gone through several editions, was transformed in the hands of the learned father into a blasphemous work directed against Christianity and Christians. Bass would have fared ill had not the censor Pohl, who had been commissioned to examine the contents of the books, been both faithful and competent. In consequence of his decision, Bass was released after ten weeks' imprisonment, at first on bail, and then absolutely. The last years of his life were devoted to the second edition of his bibliographic manual, which he intended to issue in enlarged and revised form. He died July 21, 1718 at Krotoschin without completing the work. ==Literary activity== Bass's works have the constant characteristic of answering practical needs. ===Siftei Yeshenim=== Bass's chief work is his bibliographical manual Siftei Yeshenim (Lips of the Sleepers; compare Shir haShirim Rabbah to 7:10).Amsterdam, 1680, frequently reprinted This work contains a list of 2,200 Hebrew books, in the alphabetical order of the titles, conscientiously giving the author, place of printing, year, and size of each book, as well as a short summary of its contents. The majority of the books described he knew at first hand; the description of the others he borrowed from the works of Buxtorf and Giulio Bartolocci (from the latter only in the first part). Bass's work is distinguished not only by its brevity and accuracy, but by an entirely original feature, in respect to which he had no predecessor, and almost no successor; namely, a classification of the entire Jewish literature, as far as he knew it. He divides the whole into two chief groups, Biblical and post- Biblical, and each group again into ten subdivisions. Thus, dictionaries, grammars, and translations form a subdivision of the Biblical group; while Talmud commentaries and novellæ are included in the Talmudic group. Although this classification is still very superficial and primitive, it indicates its author's wide knowledge and astonishing range of reading. In addition to the list and classification of the books, Bass gives an alphabetical index of authors, including one of the Tannaim, Amoraim, Saboraim, and Geonim Bass's introduction to his work is most characteristic of the spirit prevailing among German Jews at that time: he cites ten \\"religious reasons\\" for the usefulness of his work. Not only was Bass's undertaking new to the German Jews, but it also appeared strange to them; only the Portuguese Jews of Amsterdam, who had a leaning toward methods and systems, knew how to appreciate him. Christian scholars, however, were at once impressed by the scholarship, style, usefulness, and reliability of the bibliography. Latin as well as German translations, some of which are still extant in manuscript, were undertaken by Christian Orientalists. The greatest proof of Bass's merit lies in the fact that Wolf's Bibliotheca Hebræa is based chiefly on the Siftei Yeshenim. ===Siftei Chachamim=== His work Siftei Chachamim is a supercommentary to Rashi's commentary to the Pentateuch and the five Megillot.Published Amsterdam, 1680, and many times reprinted Its general method is to identify the difficulty which made Rashi's comments necessary. Much of its material is based on earlier supercommentaries such as that of Elijah Mizrachi; it summed up with brevity and clearness the best work of fifteen previous supercommentaries on Rashi. Even today the book is considered a useful aid toward understanding and appreciating Rashi. It is considered so essential that there exists a summary work on it, called \\"Ikar Siftei Chachamim.\\" This work generally leaves out the questions that the Siftei Chachamim raises on Rashi, and simply sums up his idea that he culled from the Rashi in about a sentence or two equivalent to the paragraph length entries in the Siftei Chachamim. To see an example, look for Weinfeld, Joseph Halevi Shalom. Chumash Orech Yamim. Jerusalem: Orech Publishers, 1997. ===Other works=== In 1669 he reprinted Moses Sartels' Yiddish glossary on the Bible, adding a grammatical preface, a work intended to supply the lack of grammatical knowledge among teachers of the young, and to furnish the latter with the correct German rendering in translating the Bible. Bass was greatly interested in improving the instruction of the young, and recommended the German-Polish Jews to imitate the methods of instruction obtaining in the Portuguese community of Amsterdam,Introduction to Siftei Yeshenim, p. 8, translated by Moritz Güdemann, in Quellenschriften zur Gesch. des Unterrichtswesens, pp. 112 et seq. describing in detail their curriculum. (His subcommentary Siftei Hachamim is also intended for elementary instruction.) His itinerary, entitled Massekhet Derek Eretz, is a short treatise on the roads of the country (Amsterdam, 1680); the book, written in Yiddish, contains also tables of all the current coins, measures, and weights in European countries, and a list of routes, post connections, and distances. ==Further reading== *Saverio Campanini, Wege in die Stadt der Bücher.

It had previously received extra funding due to its high curricular activity in technology, I.C.T. and science, for which it had been awarded, but no longer has, Technology College status. The college consists of the secondary school, and the Sixth Form Centre which was built more recently. ==History== The origins of the school date back to the middle years of the Second World War and the Beveridge Report. In 1942 the University of Oxford academic William Beveridge was asked to prepare a paper for the government outlining the problems that existed within British society. His report became the basis of the Housing Act and slum clearance, the National Health Service and most importantly the 1944 Education Act. South Holderness School came into existence as a direct result of the 1944 Act. It was recognised that there was a need for a secondary school in the South Holderness area. Children were generally educated until 14 years in a senior department of their village school. From there they entered the world of work as apprentices, farm workers, shop and office workers and so on. The 1944 Act stated that all children should remain at school until they were 15 and that after 11 years old they should be divided up according to ability. This resulted in a so-called Tri-partite System, where children had to take an examination called the 11-plus. According to how pupils performed in the examination they were offered a place at a Grammar school, a Technical school or a Secondary Modern school. The East Riding of Yorkshire Council provided grammar school places at Beverley Grammar School, Beverley High School and Bridlington School. A grammar school form was also provided at Withernsea High School. To implement the 1944 Act the East Riding of Yorkshire was divided up into catchment areas. A school was provided at the most convenient place within that area. In the case of South Holderness it was decided to place the school midway between Preston and Hedon. The catchment area was to include Aldbrough, Bilton, Burstwick, Coniston, Hedon, Paull, Preston, Sproatley, Sunk Island and Thorngumbald. The area to the north of South Holderness Technology College was served by Hornsea and to the east by Withernsea HS. Only children within the catchment area of a particular school were meant to attend that school. South Holderness school was designated a Secondary Modern school. The East Riding of Yorkshire Council did not provide Secondary Technical schools in the way that Hull City Council did with Riley High school or Greatfield High school. ===Site=== Layout of the school (2010) The council decided to provide a new secondary school in the South Holderness area. The town of Hedon is very small in terms of area and so another location had to be found. Land between the village of Preston and Hedon was identified and plans were drawn up. The school had a total area of 26 acres (10.5 hectares). A local landowner, Colonel Robinson, objected to plans to build the school on his arable land. The result was that the Ministry of Education along with the Council applied for a compulsory purchase order. This was granted after objections. The architects were appointed (Johnson and Johnson of Doncaster) and the designing of the school began. Many East Riding schools have the same trademark brick work, floor surfaces and galvanised steel windows. Their structure and internal design features are very similar. South Hunsley, Beverley Longcroft, Withernsea, Headlands and Hornsea Schools all bear a great similarity, hardly surprising when one considers that they were being built at roughly the same time. ===Original staff=== Six months before the schools were ready for opening East Riding of Yorkshire Council appointed heads, each of whom incorporated their ideas into the school building at an early stage. The person appointed to lead South Holderness school was Stuart Frith a graduate teacher of chemistry and ex-British Army Major. Frith was to lead the school from 1953 to 1974. He stated that he wanted a minimum of plastered, and therefore painted surfaces, and the provision of quarry tile floors along corridors and in the Entrance Hall. There were to be bare brick walls and hardwearing floor surfaces. ==Sixth Form== South Holderness Sixth Form is a Sixth Form College which is located in Preston, East Riding of Yorkshire England, with an enrolment of 230 students. In the year academic year of 2009–10 the Sixth Form had a 99% pass rate at A Level with over 90% of its students progressing directly onto university. Students study for AS and A levels, and BTEC, or re-sit their GCSE to improve their grades. Students attending the Sixth Form begin study at A Level in General Studies. In 2009 there was a surge of students from year 11 staying on at East Riding of Yorkshire Sixth Forms, including South Holderness to continue their A Levels. ==References== ==External links== *South Holderness Technology College Category:Educational institutions established in 1954 Category:Secondary schools in the East Riding of Yorkshire Category:1954 establishments in England Category:Community schools in the East Riding of Yorkshire Category:Holderness ","title":"Holderness Academy"},{"id":"7823115","text":"Thomas Prager (born 13 September 1985) is an Austrian footballer who plays as a midfielder for Wiener Viktoria. ==Club career== Prager was lured away by Heerenveen from FC Stadlau and played 5 years for the Frisians but never managed to claim a regular spot in the starting line-up.Thomas Prager: Der fliegende Oberösterreicher He did not feature in the 2008–09 plans of Heerenveen manager Trond Sollied and was transferred to LASK Linz.

(trading as Ferretti Group) is an Italian multinational shipbuilding company headquartered in Forlì which specialises in the design, construction and sale of luxury motor yachts. Its products are sold under the brands Ferretti Yachts, Custom Line, Pershing, Itama, Riva, Mochi Craft and CRN. Ferretti was founded in 1968 by Alessandro and Norberto Ferretti as a manufacturer of small boats and produced its first motor sailer in 1971. Ferretti expanded through making numerous acquisitions, including of Cantieri Navali dell’Adriatico – CNA S.r.l. in 1998, CRN S.p.A., in 1999, Riva S.p.A in 2000, Cantiere Navale Mario Morini and in 2002, Itama in 2004 and Allied Marine in 2008. Ferretti was acquired by the Chinese multinational heavy machinery and automotive manufacturing company Weichai Group in 2012. Ferretti has manufacturing operations in Italy and the United States. It has subsidiary companies in the United States (Ferretti Group North America), Brazil (Ferretti Group Brazil, based in São Paulo, and soon one based in Foz do Iguaçu ) and representative branches in Hong Kong and Shanghai (Ferretti Group Asia Pacific). ==History== ===1968 to 2000=== The company was founded in 1968 by Alessandro and Norberto Ferretti and produced its first motor sailer in 1971. During the 1980s, the two brothers decided to specialize in the production of luxury motoryachts. They established a new unit in Forlì, which today houses the company headquarters. In the early 1990s, Ferretti started an internationalisation process. In 1993, Ferretti of America, Inc. was founded to market motoryachts in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela and the Caribbean. Ferretti of America liaised with the sales network that was already present in Greece, France, Spain, Germany and Great Britain, increasing the impact of Ferretti sales abroad. In 1994, Ferretti began an international marketing process by creating a strategic network of dealers outside Europe. During the second half of the 1990s, after institutional investors acquired a share in the capital, an expansion strategy for external lines was started through the acquisition of companies producing luxury motoryachts. In 1996, Ferretti began operating in the segment of yachts with fibreglass flybridges, measuring 28 to 40 metres in length, through Custom Line S.p.A. In 1998, the group purchased Cantieri Navali dell’Adriatico – CNA S.r.l., which specialized in building open type motor boats with the prestigious Pershing brand. During the same year, Ferretti entered in the sport fisherman craft segment with the acquisition of American company Bertram Yacht, Inc. \\\\- the Miami shipyard. Bertram Yacht was sold in 2015. In 1999, Ferretti Group purchased CRN S.p.A., a shipyard specialising in the production of maxiyachts in fibreglass and megayachts with steel hulls and aluminium superstructures, measuring over 30 metres in length. ===2000 to 2010=== knots. Pershing 72, European Powerboat of the Year 2008 in the category 50 feet and over In the year 2000, Ferretti purchased 100% of the capital of Riva S.p.A., a producer of luxury fibreglass yachts measuring 10 to 35 metres in length, both flybridge and open. In June 2000, with the aim of further consolidating its growth and development process, Ferretti Group decided to list on the Official Italian Stock Exchange (MTA). In 2001, the company was admitted to the STAR segment (High Requisite Share Segment) of the Borsa Italiana (Italian Stock Exchange). In May 2001, Ferretti acquired the assets of the Oram shipyard in La Spezia, where the new Riva production area would subsequently be built. In August 2001, Ferretti finalized an agreement for the acquisition of the Apreamare S.p.A. shipyards in Sorrento, a leader in the production of gozzo sorrentino boats measuring 7 to 16 metres in length. In November 2001, acquisition of the Mochi Craft S.r.l. shipyard in Pesaro was finalized. In 2002, the Group took over Diesse Arredamenti, in order to acquire new skills in the nautical furnishings sector, complementary to its yacht building activity. In 2002, the Group also finalized acquisition of Cantiere Navale Mario Morini in Ancona, which enabled CRN to extend its production capacity, Pinmar S.L., a company specialized in yacht painting and refitting, and Zago S.p.A., an Italian company operating in high-profile wooden manufactured pieces and furnishings. Between June 2002 and January 2003, the Ferretti management team and institutional investors present among the shareholders (Permira), decided to launch a Voluntary Public Tender Offer to acquire the entire share capital of the Company, with the aim of further expanding the Group through acquisitions and a precise strategic, national and international plan. In 2004, through Pershing, Ferretti Group acquired the Itama shipyard, which specializes in the construction of open motoryachts, completing the current definition of the Group. In 2008, Ferretti Group acquired the assets, brands and activities of Allied Marine, an American company specialized in After Sales services and marketing of both new and pre- owned motor yachts, as well as brokerage services on the US market. In 2009, in order to align its organisational structure to the new market scenario, Ferretti Group changed its structure and undertook a series of strategic and operative actions. The Group's equity was divided between Norberto Ferretti and the management (38.2%), Mediobanca (8.8%), and senior and mezzanine lenders (the latter with a total 53% in exit participation rights). Norberto Ferretti, the Group's management and Mediobanca held 100% of the Group's voting rights. ===2009 to present=== A Mochi Craft Long Range 23 In December 2009, with the aim of continuing to focus on its core business, the Ferretti Group sold its 60% holding in Pinmar S.L., a Spanish company specializing in painting mega-yachts to Irish entrepreneur Sean Ewing. In March 2010, Ferretti continued its divestment policy by selling 100% of Apreamare S.p.A., which included the nautical pole of Torre Annunziata (Naples), to the Aprea and Pollia families, the founders of the historic Sorrento brand. In 2010, Ferretti Group Brasil was established. Finally, in 2012, Ferretti was acquired by the Chinese multinational heavy machinery and automotive manufacturing company Weichai Group. ==Operations== ===Divisions and subsidiaries=== Mochi Craft Dolphin 74 The group consists of the following design and production companies: *Ferretti Yachts (flybridge motoryachts, 14 to 29 meters) *Pershing (high performance open cruisers, 16 to 42 meters) *Itama (open motoryachts, 13 to 23 meters) *Riva (open and flybridge motoryachts, 8 to 50 meters) *Mochi Craft (lobster boats, 13 to 23 meters) *CRN (custom megayachts in steel and aluminium, 45 to 90 meters). *Custom Line (planing and semi-displacement motoryachts, 28 to 42 meters) ===Shipyards=== Ferretti Group has production facilities in: Ancona, Forlì, Cattolica, Mondolfo, La Spezia and Sarnico, Italy. ==Corporate affairs== ===Financial data=== In 2010, Ferretti Group had a turnover of approximately 500 million euro and EBITDA of around 30 million euro. The improvement of this result, in a market still characterized by price pressure, was primarily due to the key initiatives taken by the Ferretti Group during the course of the 2009-2010 nautical year, which resulted in a cost reduction of around 50 million euro. As of August, 31st, 2010, the Group's Net Financial Debt improved compared with the previous year and was reduced to around 590 million euro, basically in line with the Plan. ===Ownership=== In 1995, after the sudden death of Alessandro Ferretti, 70% of the group was acquired by Permira. In 2000, it was temporarily listed in the Italian Stock Exchange, but decided to be taken private citing concerns for negative financial climate by the September 11, 2001 attacks. Permira had a 54 times return of its original investment from the listing. In October 2006, the owners reconsidered flotation and filed an application to list its shares on the Milan stock exchange. Due to a high level of interest from private equity buyers, the IPO was postponed. Candover bought 60% of the company in an auction, outbidding the French PAI Partners and leaving the rest 30% to the founder and 10% to Permira. Based on financial data, the group was valued at 1.7 billion euros. In May 2008, when the full extend of the crisis had not yet hit, rumours circulated indicating Candover was eyeing a second IPO for the business which was seeing profits of EUR 158m on a EUR 933m turnover (2007). In September, the Consob granted the authorization for the IPO on both the London and Milan bourses. However, in January 2009, the company appointed Rothschild to advise on talks with its banking syndicate, led by Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Mediobanca to restructure a EUR 1.1bn debt. Initially Candover was expected to participate in a EUR 100m capital injection but by February, it had walked away from the table, writing off its investment; Permira had already done so. Since then the company has succeeded in renegotiating its debt, reducing its to EUR 550m against a conversion of credits into exit participation rights, a EUR 85m capital injection underwritten by the founder and CEO, Norberto Ferretti and some of the management team (EUR 70m) and Mediobanca (EUR 15m). RBS has also agreed to grantmedium terms facilities to fund working capital requirements (EUR 65m) and three major financial institutions (already partnering with Ferretti), have extended the short-term facilities (EUR 24m) to medium-term ones. The Group's equity is now held by Norberto Ferretti and the Group's management (38.2%), Mediobanca (8.8%) and senior and mezzanine lenders (for a total of 53% in exit participation rights). In particular, as a result of the agreement, Norberto Ferretti, the Group's management and Mediobanca hold 100% of the Group's voting rights. ==Racing== Motivated by the needs for high tech synergy and greater international recognition, the company entered in 1989, into offshore racing. Norberto Ferretti won the Class 1 Offshore World Championship title in 1994. The Ferretti team win the European Offshore Championship in 1995. In 1997, it won both European and World champion titles. The company attributes these winnings to a hi-tech hull designed with a carbon-fiber autoclave. ==Technology== Together with Mitsubishi the Ferretti group has developed a system called ARG (anti-rolling gyro), which reduces the effects of the waves on their boats, using a counterweight and a gyroscope. ==Notable customers== Notable Ferretti customers have included Richard Burton, Brigitte Bardot and Sophia Loren. ==References== == External links == * *Ferretti Brand Official Site *Videos of Superyachts build by Ferretti Category:Weichai Group Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1968 Category:Companies listed on the Borsa Italiana Category:Shipbuilding companies of Italy Category:Italian boat builders Category:Private equity portfolio companies Category:Italian brands Category:Yacht building companies Category:Multinational companies headquartered in Italy Category:Engineering companies of Italy Category:Italian companies established in 1968 ","title":"Ferretti Group"},{"id":"7823160","text":"John Dickey (June 23, 1794 - March 14, 1853) was a Whig member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania. ==Biography== John Dickey (father of Oliver James Dickey) was born in Greensburg, Pennsylvania.

Kyryluk. Alpha Wave Movement's musical style can be considered ambient, new-age, some space rock, the classic 1970s period German style electronic music otherwise known as Berlin school as well as the ambient aesthetics of Brian Eno, and Steve Roach. Releases such A Distant Signal and Terra have more ambient space elements than other Alpha Wave Movement releases. Beyond Silence has more space rock elements and has a more rhythmic feel in their overall music compositions. In 2007 Alpha Wave Movement released The Mystic & The Machine, a musical exploration of 1970's era romantic progressive rock performed on synthesizers with the addition of UK musician Steve Hillman on electric guitar. The influences of Genesis, Ozric Tentacles (1980s era), and Camel are quite obvious and intended and shows yet another side of Alpha Wave Movement's composition. Alpha Wave Movement's music is semi electronic-based, utilizing digital synthesizers and MIDI to create its sonic explorations. Aside from the music influences nature and natural landscapes are a continuous source of inspiration for compositions. Alpha Wave Movement has performed at the Ambient Ping Canada and at the Gathering Room USA. Alpha Wave Movement has released music on the Dutch label Groove Unlimited, Silent Records (USA), Waveform Records (USA), Spiralight (USA), Anodize (USA) and on the private label Harmonic Resonance Recordings. Alpha Wave Movement's other projects include Thought Guild (vintage synthesizer improvisation project with synthesist Christopher Cameron), Open Canvas, Subtle Shift, Biome and a solo release as Gregory Kyryluk. The latest release from Alpha Wave Movement is entitled \\"Soniq Variants\\"(2011). The release is based conceptually on the use of Ensoniq synthesizers solely for the compositions. Ensoniq was an American manufacturer that spearheaded early affordable synthesizer workstation's the first of which was the ESQ-1 in 1986. Music on this release was composed primarily on the ESQ-1, VFX-SD, SQ-R and a DP4 all of which were made by Ensoniq. Additional use of a Novation synthesizer was also incorporated to add some timbral texture. The year 2012 arrived with a new electronic music project by Gregory Kyryluk under the alias of Subtle Shift (early releases where under the alias of Within Reason). This new project dives head into the ambient dub waterways. Featuring a more sublime percussive foundation, environmental soundscapes. Drawn on the influences of the Detroit and European creative pioneering spirits such as Rod Modell and Yagya, GAS as well as incorporating 1970s electro aesthetics. To date there are four full-length releases by Subtle Shift on the Anodize and Harmonic Resonance Recording labels. In 2014 the electronica world fusion project Open Canvas (essentially Gregory Kyryluk) had a track from the Waveform Records release \\"Indumani\\" featured in the internationally popular gothic horror show True Blood.

He eventually rose to the rank of général de division and held the prestigious command of the Grenadiers à Cheval de la Garde Impériale, the senior heavy cavalry regiment of the Imperial Guard.Fierro; Palluel-Guillard; Tulard, p. 904 He was made a baron in 1809 and then became a count in 1815, after which he was known as Comte Lepic. ==Early career and Revolutionary Wars== Born the eleventh child in a poor family from Montpellier, Lepic joined a dragoon regiment at age 16 and benefitted from the outburst of the French Revolution, which facilitated his promotion to squadron commander (March 1793). He was at first involved in fighting against the Vendéean insurrection, before moving to the 'Army of Italy' in 1796, where he was remarked for gallantry and was wounded several times. Lepic remained in Italy until the end of 1805, when he was named colonel major of the Grenadiers à Cheval de la Garde Impériale regiment of the newly created Imperial Guard, which he would command for the rest of his military career. ==Napoleonic Wars== Grenadiers à Cheval as they are forming for a charge under intense fire at the battle of Eylau, in 1807. Painting by Édouard Detaille at the Chantilly Museum. Although he did not participate in the battle of Austerlitz, he did take part to the campaigns in Prussia and Poland in 1806-07\\\\. At the battle of Eylau, seeing his horse grenadiers lowering their heads as bullets whistled around, Lepic uttered the famous words: \\"Heads up, gentlemen, these are bullets, not turds !\\" (Haut la tête, messieurs, la mitraille ce n'est pas de la merde !). The ensuing heroic charge at the head of his horse grenadiers, where he was seriously wounded, brought him the rank of général de brigade. Seeing Lepic after the battle, Napoleon went to him and said: \\"I thought you had been captured, general Lepic. I was feeling deeply sorrowful about it.\\" Lepic retorted: \\"Sire, you will only ever hear of my death.\\" That evening, Lepic, who had been seriously wounded in action that day, received 50,000 francs, which he immediately distributed to his horse grenadiers. Five days later, he would be promoted to general and given an annuity of 30,000 francs.Pigeard, 143. Lepic then served in the Peninsula in 1808 but was called back to France in 1809 to serve in the newly created Grande Armée d'Allemagne, the main French army which fought the Austrians in the War of the Fifth Coalition. During this campaign, Lepic was named baron of the Empire and was involved with his horse grenadier regiment in the battle of Wagram. He would then serve in Spain and Portugal between 1810 and 1811, before being recalled to the second Grande Armée for the Russian campaign. During the campaign, his most important action was his regiment's charge against Platov's cossacks on November 7, which repulsed the Russian attack on the Emperor's headquarters. Lepic was promoted to général de division in February 1813, and he took part in the Saxon campaign of the War of the Sixth Coalition, where he would fight his last battles. Having retired in 1814, he was made a count by King Louis XVIII in January 1815. He subsequently rallied to Napoleon's return in the Hundred Days. He served in the battle of Waterloo, before being retired by Louis XVIII. ==Legacy== The name LEPIC appears on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. His son was Louis-Joseph-Napoléon Lepic (1810–1875), who had a distinguished military career and was a close supporter of Napoléon III. His grandson was Ludovic-Napoléon Lepic, an artist and friend of Edgar Degas. ==References== ==Sources== *Fierro, Alfredo; Palluel-Guillard, André; Tulard, Jean - \\"Histoire et Dictionnaire du Consulat et de l'Empire”, Éditions Robert Laffont, Category:Generals of the First French Empire Category:Commanders in the French Imperial Guard Category:1765 births Category:1827 deaths Category:Cavalry commanders Category:Names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe ","title":"Louis Lepic"},{"id":"7823208","text":"The Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order was an order from the Poor Law Commission issued on 21 December 1844 which aimed to end the distribution of outdoor relief to the able-bodied poor.Workhouse.orgs article on the order ==See also== * Outdoor Labour Test Order ==References== Category:Poor Law in Britain and Ireland Category:1844 in the United Kingdom ","title":"Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order"},{"id":"7823218","text":"Dahabshiil (, ) is an international funds transfer company headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Formed in the early 1970s, the firm operates from over 24,000 outlets and employs more than 2,000 people across 126 countries. It provides financial services to international organisations, as well as to both large and small businesses and private individuals. UK Somali Remittances Survey The company is also involved in numerous community building projects in Somaliland. It is the largest money-transfer business in Africa. ==History== A Dahabshiil franchise outlet in Brisbane, Australia. Dahabshiil (meaning \\"Gold smelter\\") was founded in 1970 by Mohamed Said Duale, a Somali entrepreneur based in Burao, the capital city of Togdheer province in the modern-day Somaliland.Matthew Saltmarsh \\"Somalis’ Money Is Lifeline for Homeland\\", The New York Times (11 November 2009). Initially a general trading enterprise, the firm began specialising in remittance broking during the 1970s, when many Somali males from Somaliland migrated to the Gulf States for work. This resulted in a growing demand for services to transfer money from those migrant workers back to their families.Overseas Development Institute Because of foreign exchange controls imposed by the Somali government at the time, most of the funds were transferred via a trade-based system known as Franco Valuta (FV); the latter process involved the import of goods, proceeds from the sale of which were sent to migrants’ families.COMPAS Publications These transactions formed the bulk of Dahabshiil's business throughout the 1980s. With the Somali Civil War fast approaching, the Duale family were among the hundreds of thousands who retreated to the Somali-inhabited Ogaden region in neighbouring Ethiopia. The business in Somaliland collapsed, but Duale was able to draw on an extensive network of contacts in the Gulf to re-establish the venture, setting up a small office in Ethiopia to serve displaced Somali communities there and in Djibouti. In 1989, Dahabshiil opened its first office in London where a number of Somalis had arrived during the war. The branch in Whitechapel was managed by Mohammed Duale's son, Abdirashid Duale, who began to expand the business as the Somali population in the UK grew.Harowo ==Somali money transfer industry== A Dahabshiil franchise outlet in Puntland, Somalia. Funds transfer services have become a large industry in Somaliland. Estimates of the aggregate value of remittances from the Somali diaspora back to the home country vary. However, a recent study by the United Nations Development Programme suggested a figure of around $1.6 billion, sent largely by emigrants in the US, Europe and the Gulf region.United Nations Development Programme United Nations Industrial Development Organization Industry experts estimate that Dahabshiil handles around two-thirds of all remittances to Somali-speaking regions. Most of the Somali money transfer operators (MTOs) are credentialed members of either the Somali Money Transfer Association (SOMTA), an umbrella organisation that regulates the community's money transfer sector, or its predecessor, the Somali Financial Services Association (SFSA). Besides Dahabshiil, Somali MTOs include Qaran Express, Mustaqbal, Amal Express, Kaah Express, Hodan Global, Olympic, Amana Express, Iftin Express and Tawakal Express. A unique feature of these Somali funds transfer companies is that they all charge lower commission fees than their Western counterparts; typically around 5% for sums of up to $1,000, a range encompassing the vast majority of Somali household remittances. For amounts greater than $1,000, Somali MTOs charge commissions of 3% to 4%, significantly lower than Western Union's 7.1% fee and MoneyGram's 7.2% fee for sending similar amounts to Ethiopia. Charges for the remittance of charity funding vary between 0% and 2%. Accounting for almost a quarter of household income in Somaliland, funds remitted by the Somali diaspora have helped to sustain communities in some of the most remote locations in the Horn of Africa.The Norwegian Council for Africa With around 40% of households receiving such assistance from relatives working abroad, remittances have proved significant in promoting private sector activity in telecoms, transport and housing, as well as in basic infrastructure, health and education.World Bank Social Development Papers It has also been argued that the inflow of such foreign-based capital has helped keep the Somali shilling afloat and offset depreciatory and inflationary pressures.\\"Business in Somalia: Commerce amid chaos.

On 5 November 2013, the High Court in London granted an interim injunction preserving the banking arrangement between Dahabshiil and Barclays until the conclusion of a full trial. Judge Launcelot Henderson described Barclays' decision to terminate Dahabshiil's account as \\"unfair\\", and requested a detailed examination into the reasons behind the bank's decision.Somali Money Transfer Company Wins Injunction Against Barclays Bank Barclays have since ended their relationship with Dahabshiil as part of their de-risking. ==Controversies== ===Guantanamo Bay detainee=== In February 2009, Peter Finn writing in The Washington Post, cited allegations that Guantanamo captive Mohammed Sulaymon Barre, while working for Dahabshiil, may have laundered money for terrorists. He suggested this was an example of the difficulties that faced the joint task force US President Barack Obama had put in place to conduct new reviews of the detainees' status. === Unfair advantage through ties with the government === Ever since Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud was elected for president in 2010, certain Somali journalists and political groups have been accusing him of providing Dahabshiil with unfair advantage and complete control over Somali remittances, which play a significant role on the local economy. These allegations are often based on the fact that Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud has appointed Ali H. Hassan, who is Dahabshiil's founder cousin, as the chief of cabinet, and Sa’ad Haji Ali Shireh, the former CEO of the firm as a minister ===Website shutdown=== In 2011, a group of independent Somali journalists alleged that Dahabshiil had temporarily succeeded in convincing their web-host to shut down their site because they had published stories critical of the firm. They published a copy of a letter faxed to their webhosting service, demanding the removal of over a dozen of their articles about Dahabshiil. The reporters also suggested one of the stories Dahabshiil wanted removed concerned a song by popular Somali singer Saado Ali Warsame that was critical of Dahabshiil. ===Bell Pottinger=== In 2011, an undercover investigation by The Independent suggested that public relations firm Bell Pottinger had been contracted by Dahabshiil to minimise any negative reporting of the company, including the Guantanamo Bay detainee affair. The Bell Pottinger executives detailed their techniques, which purportedly included manipulating the ranking of Google search results to suppress unwanted coverage, and also boasted that they had a 'team' that could manage Wikipedia articles. The contract was said to have been a success. ===Hussein et al v. Dahabshiil=== On 9 December 2015, the son of killed Somali artist Saado Ali Warsame filed a lawsuit against Dahabshiil in US federal court. The plaintiff Harbi Hussein claims that the company bankrolled the assassination of his mother and other Al-Shabaab terror. The 24-page complaint filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York traces Ali's musical career, her opposition to the former military junta and outspoken criticism of the company which entailed publishing a song where it referred to Dahabshiil as \\"Blood Smelter\\" as opposed to its original meaning, \\"Gold Smelter\\". ==References== ==External links== *Money man serves the Somali diaspora *How displaced communities use technology to access financial services - by Abdirashid Duale Category:Informal value transfer systems Category:Companies of Somaliland Category:Financial services companies of the United Kingdom Category:Financial services companies established in 1970 Category:Companies based in Dubai Category:Financial services companies of the United Arab Emirates Category:1970 establishments in the Trucial States Category:Emirati companies established in 1970 ","title":"Dahabshiil"},{"id":"7823224","text":"Jacobo Bolbochán (26 December 1906 – 29 July 1984) was an Argentine chess master.

The more than 250 species are found worldwide primarily in woodland habitats. A common name is flat-footed flies, but this is also used for the closely related Opetiidae which were included in the Platypezidae in former times. Some other genera formerly included here have been recognized as quite more distant and are nowadays placed in the asilomorph family Atelestidae. Platypezidae wing veins Lindneromyia sp. group-species Symmetricella ==Description== For terms see Morphology of Diptera. Platypezidae are minute to medium sized (1.5–6 mm) slender or robust flies. The male and female usually differ in colour. Males in particular are often all black, one or both sexes may be in part or all grey or yellow. Markings may be orange, grey or silver. The abdomen may have two colours. Males have holoptic eyes. The antenna has three segments, the third is the largest and bears a long, apical arista. The wing is clear or tinged (the area along the wing margin, around veins Sc and R1 is darkened in some genera). The wing has large anal lobe and the anal vein reaches the wing margin. The cell cup ends in an acute angle and is often elongate.Vein M is forked in most genera. The crossvein DM-Cu is present (absent in Microsania where crossvein R-M is also lacking). The legs are short and robust. The first tarsal segment is usually swollen in the male, slender in the female and the distal tarsal segments are cylindrical (the first tarsal segment of the hind leg is long and cylindrical in the subfamily Callomyiina). In the subfamily Platypezinae the first tarsal segment of the hind leg is shortand laterally compressed, the distal are tarsal segments are also laterally compressed, in particular in the female. The larva has a poorly differentiated, fairly unsclerotized head with short tuberclelike antennae located above rudimentary palpi and 11 body segments. It is amphipneustic (having only the anterior and posterior pairs of spiracle). The form is usually flattened, but in some species cylindrical. Most species have lateral marginal processes, typically with one pair on each body segment, except for segments 2 and 11, which have more. Smaller dorsal processes are present on segments 3–10. Segments 3–10 often bear bristles, but bristles are not present on segments 1,2, and 11. The spiracles are located on the ends of wrinkled tube-like spiracular processes, the anterior pair (prothoracic spiracle) are on segment 1 the posterior ones are on segment 11 (anal segment) . ==Biology== Members of the Platypezidae inhabit damp woodlands. Larvae are fungivores. Adult males form aerial swarms before mating using trees or bushes as swarm markers. Some species of Microsania Zetterstedt are attracted to wood smoke and wood ash. Adults may be found performing rapid erratic movements on broad leaves of both woody and herbaceous plants, evidently feeding on surface deposits. Platypeza hirticeps on Impatiens Adults are seen either on the wing or running about in an erratic fashion on the leaves of bushes in partially sunlit, dappled shade.They hover in swarms of dancing males in forest openings. The females are attracted to chosen males in such swarms, where aerial coupling begins and the paired flies settle with heads in opposite directions on low bushes until mating is over. Feeding platypezids move rapidly over leaves, occasionally stopping to ingest honeydew or other food. The first feeding episode begins at midmorning, ceases at a time later in the morning then resumes in the afternoon. These times corresponds to the times of the day when insectivorous birds are least likely to feed.The mid day rest is when the sun is at a specific angle (peculiar to each species) and the afternoon feeding episode begins when the sun sinks to the angle that initiated the rest in the morning.Kessel E.L. ,1981 Platypezidae. in: McAlpine J.F.

It stretches from the River Liffey at its southern end via Mountjoy Square to Dorset Street at its northern end. The Custom House terminates the vista at the southern end, and the street is divided into Gardiner Street Upper (north end), Gardiner Street Middle and Gardiner Street Lower (south end). At its gestation, Gardiner Street was intended to be Dublin's largest, widest, longest and grandest street. However, owing to the Acts of Union in 1801, the economic depression that Dublin experienced and the associated drastic fall in demand for city townhouses, the street was never fully completed to its intended grandeur and scale. Lower Gardiner Street sign Lower Gardiner Street South leads from Mountjoy Square to the Georgian Custom House overlooking the river Liffey. Several hostels are on this part of the street as well as Trinity Church. The DART line crosses near the intersection with Beresford Place behind the Custom House; this end is only a few minutes walk from Connolly station, and around the corner from Lower Gardiner Street is the Luas red line stop at Busáras. There is heavy road traffic on Lower Gardiner Street as it is also part of Dublin City Council's Inner Orbital Route with traffic creating a bottleneck as it comes down Gardiner Street as well as filtering in from Talbot Street at this point. Middle and Upper Gardiner Street are separated from the lower street by the west side of Mountjoy Square. On Upper Gardiner Street is located Saint Francis Xavier Church, a notable stone Classical building dating from 1829 and with a connection to the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins, Blessed John Sullivan SJ, is interred in the church. Gardiner Street has another notable poetic connection by way of featuring in Patrick Kavanagh's poem \\"Memory of My Father\\". The core part of the street was commenced in 1792 and finished around 1820. Gardiner's grand vision was to see a crescent built where the Mater Hospital now stands while the other end would culminate with a view of The Custom House. Georgian terraces still remain largely intact at the lower end of Lower Gardiner Street approaching the Custom House, at Mountjoy Square and in surrounding streets however large tracts of the street between Mountjoy Square and Railway Street were controversially demolished in the 1970s and 1980s to make way for social housing and a new park called Diamond Park near where the street meets Summerhill Parade. In the 2010s the built environment changed again with the provision of purpose built student accommodation at the corner of Gardiner Street Lower and Summerhill Parade. ==Historic former residents== Playwright, producer and actor Dion Boucicault (1820–1890) lived in number 47 Lower Gardiner Street. Boucicault was involved with over 150 plays, and is best known for The Shaughraun, other works include: “Napoleon’s Old Guard”, “A Legend of the Devil’s Dyke”, “London Assurance”, and “The Colleen Bawn”. His mother was a relative of the first Arthur Guinness. Both Seán O'Casey (see also Mountjoy Square) and John Millington Synge acknowledged him as being a major influence on their dramatic works. Number 41 Gardiner Street Upper was home of Joe McGuinness, elected as a Sinn Féin TD for Longford South to the first Dáil in 1918 while in Lewes Gaol, under the slogan of “Vote him in to get him out”. During the Easter Rising in 1916 McGuinness was also involved in commandeering the Four Courts for the volunteers. ==See also== *List of streets and squares in Dublin ==External links== *A live webcam overlooking the junction of Lower Gardiner Street and Talbot Street *Official website of Saint Francis Xavier's Church *Patrick Kavanagh, Memory of My Father Category:Streets in Dublin (city) Category:Georgian architecture in Ireland ","title":"Gardiner Street"},{"id":"7823288","text":"John Hoge Ewing (October 5, 1796 - June 9, 1887) was an American politician from Pennsylvania who served as a Whig member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Pennsylvania's 20th congressional district from 1845 to 1847. ==Biography== Ewing, son of William Porter Ewing and Mary Conwell Ewing, was born near Brownsville, Pennsylvania in 1796. In 1814, he graduated from Washington College (now Washington and Jefferson College) in Washington, Pennsylvania. He studied law, was admitted to the Bar in 1818, and commenced practice in Washington, Pennsylvania. He practiced law for only two years when he was awarded a contract (in partnership with his father) to construct the National Pike's road-bed between Brownsville and Hillsborough, Pennsylvania, which was completed in 1820. Ewing never returned to the active practice of law, but instead engaged in a variety of business and agricultural pursuits. On November 2, 1820, Ewing married Ellen Blaine, daughter of James Blaine, Esq., and aunt of James Gillespie Blaine, the Republican presidential candidate in 1884. The Ewings had ten children (not all of whom survived childhood) before Ellen Blaine Ewing died in 1840 from complications following childbirth; in 1845, John Hoge Ewing married Margaret Brown, with whom he had two children. Ewing was a trustee of Washington College from 1834 to 1887 and of Washington Female Seminary from 1846 to 1887. He was a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1835-36, and served in the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 17th district from 1838 to 1842. He was elected as a Whig to the Twenty-ninth Congress, and was a delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention. He was a staunch supporter of the Union cause during the Civil War, and in 1862, at the age of 66, served as Captain of Company F of the 6th Pennsylvania Regiment of Militia, which was briefly called up and deployed to Chambersburg, Pennsylvania during Robert E. Lee's Maryland invasion that September. Ewing was an Elder and Trustee in the First Presbyterian Church of Washington, and was the long-time president of the Washington County Agricultural Society. He owned substantial tracts of land in Washington County, the Virginia (later West Virginia) panhandle, and Wright County, Iowa (and possibly other places). He also and operated a small coal mine a few miles north of Washington Borough in an area known as the Meadowlands. In addition to his work on the National Road, Ewing was also a superintendent of construction over a portion of the Washington-Pittsburgh Turnpike in the mid-1830s. Additionally, Ewing was an active proponent of railroads as far back as 1831, and in the 1850s and 1860s he was instrumental in garnering local support for both the Hempfield Railroad and the Chartiers Valley Railroad, which linked Washington to Wheeling and Pittsburgh, respectively. In addition to serving on the board of directors of the Chartiers Valley Railroad and as the first president of the Washington- Waynesburg Railroad, Ewing was also a longtime director of the Franklin Bank of Washington. Ewing died in Washington on June 9, 1887, at the age of 90. He was interred in Washington Cemetery, which he helped to establish and incorporate more than 30 years earlier. ==Footnotes== ==Sources== *The Political Graveyard Washington \\"Examiner\\" and \\"Reporter\\" newspapers, 1809–1888 Crumrine, Boyd, \\"History of Washington County, Pennsylvania\\" 1882.

The previous deadliest tornado struck Toyohashi City, Aichi Prefecture in 1941, killing 12; and the deadliest killed 16 in Miyazaki, Miyazaki Prefecture in 1881.Japanese Tornadoes Not As Uncommon as Believed The November tornado also took out power to approximately 600 homes and destroyed 40 separate buildings. The meteorological agency estimates a wind speed for the tornado at more than F2 on the Fujita scale. The tornado was later confirmed as an F3. It was likely a low-mild F3 with winds around 160-165mph, well built, conventional earthquake resistant homes lost their roofs and some walls and even conventional multi floor houses lost their stories as well, cars were thrown for a short distance and overturned, and poorly built structures were swept away entirely. Stronger reinforced-concrete buildings had partial roof collapse, all doors blown in, and total loss of glass windows; they also lost the entrances if they were not made of steel- reinforced concrete, patios were swept away, and garages were blown in.https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Damage-to-construction-work-offices- due-to-a-tornado-in-Saroma-cho-Hokkaido-Japan- on_fig1_311838885https://extremeplanet.me/tag/hokkaido-tornado/ == See also == * Tornadoes of 2006 * List of Asian tornadoes and tornado outbreaks == References == Category:2006 in Japan Category:Tornadoes of 2006 Tornadoes Category:History of Hokkaido Category:F3 tornadoes Category:November 2006 events in Asia Category:Tornadoes in Japan ","title":"2006 Saroma tornado"},{"id":"7823339","text":"Pentre Ifan (literally \\"John's Village\\") is the name of an ancient manor in the community and parish of Nevern, Pembrokeshire, Wales. It is from Cardigan, Ceredigion, and east of Newport, Pembrokeshire. Pentre Ifan contains and gives its name to the largest and best preserved neolithic dolmen in Wales. The Pentre Ifan monument is a scheduled monument and is one of three Welsh monuments to have received legal protection under the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882. The dolmen is maintained and cared for by Cadw,Cadw website the Welsh Historic Monuments Agency. ==Toponymy== translates to \\"Ifan's village\\" – from pentref – pen head, and tref town. ==The Monument== As it now stands, the Pentre Ifan Dolmen is a collection of seven principal stones. The largest is the huge capstone, long, wide and thick. Dyfed Archaeological Trust - Archwilio Database It is estimated to weigh 16 tonnes and rests on the tips of three other stones, some off the ground. There are six upright stones, three of which support the capstone. Of the remaining three, two portal stones form an entrance and the third, at an angle, appears to block the doorway. ==Original use== A possible reconstruction under the traditional theory as to its use The dolmen dates from around 3500 BC, and has traditionally been identified as a communal burial. Under this theory the existing stones formed the portal and main chamber of the tomb, which would originally have been covered by a large mound of stones about long and 17 m wide. Some of the kerbstones, marking the edge of the mound, have been identified during excavations. The stone chamber was at the southern end of the long mound, which stretched off to the north. Very little of the material that formed the mound remains. Some of the stones have been scattered, but at least seven are in their original position. An elaborate entrance façade surrounding the portal, which may have been a later addition,stonepages.com Accessed 7 June 2014 was built with carefully constructed dry stone walling. Individual burials are thought to have been made within the stone chamber, which would be re-used many times. No traces of bones were found in the tomb, raising the possibility that they were subsequently transferred elsewhere. ===Alternative theory=== A major study by Cummings and Richards in 2014 produced a different explanation for the monument. (text is in English) They identify several distinctive attributes shared by the class of monument known as dolmens, all of which are particularly well exemplified at Pentre Ifan. Pentre Ifan, photographed in around 1885 First, such monuments typically have a large capstone derived from a glacial erratic, far bigger than is required or sensible if the aim is to roof a chamber. Furthermore, the capstone has a flat underside. Sometimes, as here, this has been arrived at by splitting the rock; at other sites, such as Garn Turne, some 12 km to the south-west, it has been laboriously 'pecked' off using stone tools. The capstone is supported on the tapering tips of slender uprights. As at Pentre Ifan, there are often other stones within the group, but they play no part in holding up the capstone, and the resulting effect of the enormous stone appearing to float above the other stones would seem to be deliberate and desired. If these are the key elements of the monument then, it is argued, the stones were never designed to be buried within a mound, and they never formed a chamber to contain bones. What we see today is the monument as it was intended to be seen. It might therefore represent a more elaborate version of a standing stone. Its purpose could be simply to demonstrate the status and skill of the builders, or to add significance and gravitas to an already significant place. ===Construction technique=== The sheer size of the huge capstone that is supported by the larger dolmens makes it overwhelmingly likely that the stone was not brought in from elsewhere, but already stood as an independent glacial erratic on the same spot it now occupies. Evidence from the 1948 excavation is compatible with the idea of a large pit being dug at Pentre Ifan, to expose and work on the stone, perhaps splitting it to create a flat underside, It could then be levered vertically upwards a little at a time, using poles, ropes, and large numbers of people, and packed into place using a growing heap of boulders. Once at the required height, the supporting uprights could be introduced, and the boulders removed to leave only the uprights, and such other surrounding stones as were wanted. ==Archaeology== View of portal Pentre Ifan was studied by early travellers and antiquarians, and rapidly became famous as an image of ancient Wales,www.bluestonewales.com, accessed 7 June 2014 from engravings of the romantic stones. George Owen wrote of it in enthusiastic terms in 1603, and Richard Tongue painted it in 1835.www.rock- art-in-wales.co.uk , accessed 7 June 2014 The first United Kingdom legislation to protect ancient monuments was passed in 1882, and 'The Pentre Evan Cromlech' (as it was styled) was on the initial list of 68 protected sites - one of only three in Wales. On 8 June 1884, two years after the passing of the first Ancient Monuments Act, Augustus Pitt Rivers, Britain's first Inspector of Ancient Monuments, made a visit and produced sketch plans of the monument. The legal protection the Act gave was limited. It became an offence to remove stones or items from the site, but the owner of a monument was exempt from any prosecution. The Act however provided for the Commissioner of Works to become 'guardian' of a scheduled monument – in effect to own the monument, even though the land on which it stood remained in private ownership. Perhaps as result of Pitt Rivers' visit, this protection was put in place, and the Commissioner of Works and his various successor bodies have been guardians of Pentre Ifan ever since. Archaeological excavations took place in 1936–37 and 1958–59, both led by William Francis Grimes. This identified rows of ritual pits which lay under the mound, and therefore must predate it. Kerbstones for the mound were also found, but not in a complete sequence, and aligned more to the pits than to the stone chamber. Very few items were found in the excavations, other than some flint flakes, and a small amount of Welsh (Western) pottery. The dolmen is maintained and cared for by Cadw, the Welsh Historic Monuments Agency. The site is well kept, and entrance is free. It is about from Cardigan, and east of Newport, Pembrokeshire.

It is located at Vasagatan 19–21 in central Stockholm. ==History== The theater was designed by Fredrik Ekberg (1837- 1898) and inaugurated in 1886. It was for many years run by theatre director and actor Albert Ranft (1858–1938) who in the early 20th century staged a large number of French and British comedy plays. He had personal contact with many of the most popular European comedy playwrights at the time, including George Bernard Shaw, and successfully had a great number of contemporary comedy plays translated and staged in Sweden. Plays such as Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest (Mr Ernst), Shaw's You Never Can Tell (Man kan aldrig veta) and Major Barbara, and Jack Straw by W. Somerset Maugham. Popular French playwrights at the theatre included Georges Feydeau and Georges Berr. Works by August Strindberg were also produced at the Vasateatern.Robinson, Michael. Editor. An International Annotated Bibliography of Strindberg Studies 1870–2005: The plays. MHRA (2008) (page 954) Over the years it has produced most of the classic farces and comedies. Historic long-runners from the 1950s to the 1980s include Charley's Aunt, the stage version of Cactus Flower and The Spanish Fly (Die spanische Fliege), the popular 1914 German farce by Franz Arnold and Ernst Bach. Swedish actor Krister Henriksson used to be the co- owner and theatre director. The theatre closed in 2009 in connection with an extensive renovation of the block that was transformed into Scandic Grand Central Hotel. Large parts of the interior of the theatre was taken down while the auditorium was used as storage during the construction. Parts of the theatre's former premises have been occupied by the hotel business. The theatre cafe was integrated with the hotel and converted into the bistro. After the property is sold by the developer Diligentia to Norwegian real estate management company KLP Eiendom. The theater lounge was saved, and after a major renovation, the theater operations resumed in the fall of 2016 with Joe Labero's show A Magic World. The parlor now seats 320 on the parquet floor and 150 on the balcony. After the new opening, the theater has also been used extensively as a concert venue. ==References== ==External links== *Vasateatern.se (official site ) Category:Theatres in Stockholm Category:19th- century theatre Category:20th-century theatre Category:Theatres completed in 1886 ","title":"Vasateatern"},{"id":"7823408","text":"Abdelkarim Kissi (; born 5 May 1980 in Oujda) is a Moroccan football midfielder.

It is owned by Univision and airs a Spanish- language sports radio format. The station serves as the Spanish flagship radio station of the Houston Texans football team and also airs Houston Dynamo soccer games. KLAT has studios and offices located at 5100 Southwest Freeway in Uptown Houston. The transmitter site is on West Little York Road in northwest Houston.Radio-Locator.com/KLAT By day, KLAT broadcasts at 5,000 watts. But to protect other stations on AM 1010, a Canadian clear-channel frequency, KLAT must reduce power at night to 3,600 watts. ==History== ===Early Years as KODA=== On July 31, 1961, the station signed on as KODA.Broadcasting Yearbook 1963 page B-179 It was put on the air by Paul Taft of the Taft Broadcasting Company (no relation to Taft Broadcasting of Cincinnati, Ohio). Taft already owned an FM station, 99.1 KODA-FM, airing a beautiful music format. But few people had FM radios in those days, so an AM station was added to make the format available to more Houston residents. KODA was a daytimer during its early years, so it was required to go off the air between sunset and sunrise, while KODA-FM broadcast around the clock. At first, KODA and KODA-FM simulcast the same beautiful music, competing with ABC-owned 1320 KXYZ, which also played easy listening music. But beginning in 1967, the Federal Communications Commission banned AM-FM combos in most cities from simulcasting around the clock, so most of the day, KODA began airing a slightly different format, adding middle of the road vocals to the mostly instrumental playlist. Even though 1320 KXYZ was owned by ABC, that station stopped carrying ABC newscasts. They could only be heard on 1360 KWBA (now KWWJ), based in nearby Baytown, Texas. So the AM version of KODA began airing ABC News each hour. ===KODA Becomes \\"La Tremenda\\"=== An old logo of KLAT In 1978, Group W Westinghouse Broadcasting purchased KODA-AM-FM from Taft and, the following year, re-sold the AM station. The call sign changed to KLAT in 1979, as the format flipped to popular Spanish-language Regional Mexican music, branded as \\"La Tremenda.\\" The name La Tremenda 1010 (which translates to \\"The Tremendous 1010\\") was a slogan created by the station's new owners, Marcos Rodriguez, Sr. and his son, Marcos A. Rodriguez, operating as the Spanish Broadcasting Corporation. In 1984, KLAT obtained FCC authorization for round-the-clock operation, giving KLAT Class B status.Broadcasting Yearbook 1984 page B-265 Unfortunately in late 1979, a fire caused the Harris MW-5 transmitter to melt down. The MW-5 used a step up transformer to raise the three phase input power (at 240 volts) to 17,000 volts. The primary wiring had been bundled closely to the secondary wiring and tightly lashed together. When an insulation breakdown allowed the input wiring to arc, the high temperatures allowed the secondary wires to short to the inputs. This caused extremely high circulating currents and a meltdown of the transformer frame, made of metal castings and laminations. To add nighttime broadcasts, a seventh tower was added to the array. This was used with five of the existing day towers to make a new parallelogram shaped system. KLAT began night operation at 1,000 watts. This properly protected other stations on AM 1010 as required by FCC rules, but the nighttime signal did not cover all of Houston. This particular authorization was allowed under a waiver for minority-owned stations. Later on, the station received special authority from the F.C.C. to mitigate interference at night from foreign stations (as many south Florida stations get a break from Cuban interference such as WAXY in South Miami). This special temporary authority (STA) allowed the station to operate at 5,000 watts at night using all seven towers. This improved coverage but did not give KLAT 100% nighttime coverage of Houston. In 1995 the station built a second tower site in Northwest Houston, using six towers and 3,600 watts for nighttime operation. The lowered power did not cover quite as large an area as the former setup. But because of the transmitter's better location, it covered more of the Houston radio market. The project used several consultants, ending with duTreil, Lundin and Rackley. ===Spanish-language Talk and Sports=== In 2003, KLAT was bought by Univision, primarily a Spanish-language TV network that was also getting into radio ownership.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2010 page D-530 In 2012, KLAT became part of the Univision America talk radio network. That continued until July 17, 2015, when the talk format was dropped and replaced by a Spanish Christian contemporary format known as \\"Amor Celestial\\" which translates to \\"Heavenly Love\\".Univision To Launch National Talk Network - Radio Insight (Released May 30, 2012) In March 2016, KLAT began to air Houston Dynamo soccer games, as a first step into sports radio.

He would eventually represent the Spain under-17 team, at the same time as Andrés Iniesta, José Antonio Reyes and Fernando Torres. ==Playing career== Gonzalo joined Real Madrid's youth system, but could never move past its third team as a senior. In his country of adoption he never played in higher than the third division, also representing AD Alcorcón, Mérida UD and CF Palencia. In 2005, Gonzalo moved to the Netherlands, first with AGOVV Apeldoorn, being one of the leading top scorers in the second level season under manager Stanley Menzo. He immediately switched to the Eredivisie after signing with SC Heerenveen, playing his first match in the competition on 10 February 2007 against Vitesse Arnhem but appearing rarely over the course of two seasons, finishing 2007–08 on loan to Heracles Almelo and helping the club narrowly avoid relegation. Subsequently, Gonzalo signed with FC Groningen, penning a four-year deal with the Euroborg club. First-choice in his debut campaign – 28 matches, four goals – he was rarely played in 2009–10, being again loaned in the January transfer window, now to VVV-Venlo. In June 2011, Gonzalo moved to Cyprus with AEK Larnaca FC. On the 14th, in the second qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League, he scored a hat-trick in an 8–0 away routing of Floriana FC. In June 2012, Gonzalo signed with Israel's Maccabi Tel Aviv FC. He settled rarely in the following years, but did spend two seasons with Cypriot First Division club Anorthosis Famagusta FC, the first on loan. Gonzalo returned to Dutch football on 4 August 2015, after agreeing to a contract at Heracles. He retired at the age of 34, following a spell with former youth club SD Compostela. ==Coaching career== García started working as a manager immediately after retiring, acting as assistant at Esbjerg fB of the Danish 1st Division. On 16 May 2019, after one year in the same capacity at FC Twente, he was appointed their head coach. His contract was not renewed after it expired following the 2019–20 season. ==Honours== Maccabi Tel Aviv *Israeli Premier League: 2012–13 ==References*Stats at Voetbal International * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Uruguayan people of Spanish descent Category:Sportspeople from Montevideo Category:Uruguayan footballers Category:Spanish footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Segunda División B players Category:Tercera División players Category:Real Madrid C footballers Category:AD Alcorcón footballers Category:Mérida UD footballers Category:CF Palencia footballers Category:SD Compostela footballers Category:Eredivisie players Category:Eerste Divisie players Category:AGOVV Apeldoorn players Category:SC Heerenveen players Category:Heracles Almelo players Category:FC Groningen players Category:VVV-Venlo players Category:Cypriot First Division players Category:AEK Larnaca FC players Category:Anorthosis Famagusta FC players Category:Israeli Premier League players Category:Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C. players Category:Spain youth international footballers Category:Spanish expatriate footballers Category:Uruguayan expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in the Netherlands Category:Expatriate footballers in Cyprus Category:Expatriate footballers in Israel Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in the Netherlands Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in Cyprus Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in Israel Category:Uruguayan expatriate sportspeople in the Netherlands Category:Uruguayan expatriate sportspeople in Cyprus Category:Uruguayan expatriate sportspeople in Israel Category:Spanish football managers Category:Eredivisie managers Category:FC Twente managers Category:Spanish expatriate football managers Category:Expatriate football managers in the Netherlands ","title":"Gonzalo García García"},{"id":"7823516","text":"Beer filling line Laško Brewery () is the largest brewery in Slovenia.

He attended the common schools and Milton Academy. He taught in Huntingdon Academy, studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1836 and commenced practice in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Calvin was elected as a Whig to the Thirty-first Congress. He declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1850. He resumed the practice of law and served as director of the Hollidaysburg School Board for thirty years. He was a member of the State revenue board and a member of the State constitutional convention in 1873. He died in Hollidaysburg in 1890 and was buried in Zion Lutheran Cemetery (not in the Presbyterian Cemetery as previously thought although a grandson of the same name is buried there). A Fall 1961 Bulletin of the Blair County Historical Society republished an article by Dr. Harry T. Coffey (written May 1, 1896) about the early days of the town and the leading men of Hollidaysburg: \\"Among the young lawyers and business men who afterwards became prominent in public affairs were such men as David R. Porter, afterwards governor; James M. Bell, A. Porter Wilson and Samuel Calvin, (then a schoolteacher in Huntingdon). \\"...I remember distinctly seeing as they came out in weekly parts, in green paper covers the first issues of Dicken's (then called \\"Boz\\") \\"Pickwick Papers.\\" Lying on the counter and hearing Samuel Calvin reading aloud to some friends who might be with him, the doings of the immortal Pickwick... No man was ever born better fitted to interpret Dickens, (Himself scarcely excepted) than Samuel Calvin. Himself for many years an accomplished principal, well versed in rhetoric and elocution and an orator of no little ability: a man whose able speeches on the subject of the tariff made him prominent as the whig (sic) candidate for governor in after years; a man who had much of the gentleness, amiability and good nature, without any of the weakness of Pickwick. \\"Mr. Calvin, who must have removed from Huntingdon very soon after my father, was a frequent visitor at our house. He had a wide knowledge of classical literature, was a fine conversationalist, and I am indebted to him for some of the finest quotations from them, I can now recall, and also in developing my taste in the matter of reading only the best authors, especially English, whom he seems to have at his fingerends.\\" Samuel Calvin married Rebecca Blodget in the early 1840s and produced a daughter, Eliza in 1845, and a son, Mathew, in 1847. Mathew followed his father's example and became a lawyer. Descendants of Samuel Calvin live in several states; Virginia, Maryland, Florida, and Pennsylvania. ==Sources== *The Political Graveyard Category:1811 births Category:1890 deaths Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania Category:Pennsylvania lawyers Category:American Presbyterians Category:Milton Academy alumni Category:Pennsylvania Whigs Category:People from Montour County, Pennsylvania Category:Whig Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"Samuel Calvin"},{"id":"7823568","text":"Danny Wintjens (born 30 September 1983 in Maastricht) is a Dutch former professional football goalkeeper.

The prison is operated by Sodexo Justice Services, and is the only dual purpose-built prison holding males and females in the United Kingdom. The prison, which has a population of 320 inmates, comprises four large wings, each with a separate housing arrangement for female detainees and male detainees. It is managed by the Newton Secure Training Centre (NSTC), and the associated training centre, which operates under Sodexo Services, comprises 26 housing units, ranging from 12-storey purpose built units to 10-storey semiprivate accommodation units. ==History== HMP Peterborough was built on the site of the former Baker Perkins engineering works. The prison opened in 2005, despite a great deal of protest from local residents. The Prison Service claimed at the time that Peterborough as a 'mixed-use' prison would become a blueprint for the prisons of the future. Peterborough Prison was soon involved in controversy however, when the jail advertised to recruit 2 holistic therapists to offer reflexology, aromatherapy and Indian head massages to inmates. The MP for Peterborough, Stewart Jackson accused the prison of pampering inmates and sending out the wrong message to hard-working families. In January 2008, a national table of prisons compiled by the Prison Service revealed that Peterborough Prison had come last out of 132 prisons and prison clusters, with low marks for reducing re-offending, organisational effectiveness and decency. A month later, women prisoners at Peterborough complained that the food served at the jail was too high in calories, and made them put on weight. Officials at the prison claimed that healthy options were always available for inmates at mealtimes. In January 2013, the Ministry of Justice announced that an additional houseblock will be constructed at Peterborough Prison, increasing the overall capacity of the jail. The prison was the scene of an incident involving a Royal Air Force bomb disposal team on 13 April 2018, which deployed a bomb disposal robot to remotely interact with a silver Volkswagen Golf at the prison. Authorities revealed the following day they had been responding to a reported bomb in the car but this proved incorrect. ==References== ==External links== * Ministry of Justice pages on Peterborough * Sodexo Justice Services page on Peterborough Category:Prisons in Cambridgeshire Category:Category B prisons in England Category:Women's prisons in England Category:Buildings and structures in Peterborough Category:2005 establishments in England Category:Private prisons in the United Kingdom Category:Sodexo Justice Services ","title":"HM Prison Peterborough"},{"id":"7823656","text":"Harry Kroger is an American physicist and electrical engineer.

Reddoch, Klein Evans and Ralph Hooks, obtained a construction permit to build a new 250-watt, daytime- only radio station in Oakdale, Louisiana, on October 23, 1952. The station took the call letters KREH and signed on January 31, 1953, from its studios and transmitter east of town on the highway to Ville Platte. Evans, who had been a soldier stationed at Fort Bliss, died after he got lost flying home to De Ridder, and crashed near New Waverly, Texas in August, 1953. Reddoch absorbed Evans's ownership stake, and Reddoch and Hooks became the owners of Louisiana Broadcasting Service, joined in 1958 by C. Winsett Reddoch; the Reddochs became the sole owners in 1970. KREH was joined by an FM station, KCWR at 104.9 MHz, in 1972; by this time, KREH was a country music outlet affiliated with the ABC Entertainment network. The stations remained in these formats through their sale to George Mowad, a physician and the mayor of Oakdale, for $400,000 in 1981. Under Mowad, the interim station manager was Donald R. Lindig, a white man married to a Black woman. This led to harassment by the local Ku Klux Klan, whose leader, Oddist J. Lambright, was charged with conspiring to interfere with his rights by distributing flyers containing racial slurs and urging a boycott of the station by local businesses; Lambright and two others in Klan robes went to Lindig's apartment to encourage his family to leave town. On October 16, 1982, Mowad carried out a format overhaul. KCWR, until then a contemporary outlet, flipped to country as KGBM- FM, and KREH became a Southern gospel outlet. Two years later, both stations were sold to Strother Broadcasting Company of Louisiana for $350,000. KREH and KGBM-FM became KICR-AM-FM after the sale. In 1988, the FCC approved a frequency change to 98.7 MHz and class increase for KICR-FM. The upgrade would allow the FM station to enter the Alexandria radio market. At the same time, both stations were sold to Bob Holladay and his B & D Communications for nearly $500,000. When the FM frequency change took place in 1990, the country format that had been on FM moved to the AM frequency. The move-in of KICR-FM to the Alexandria market also meant that all station operations relocated there. By 1993, the AM station was silent, and the station no longer maintained a presence in Oakdale. That year, B & D offered to donate the AM license to the West Missionary Baptist Church. However, there were technical obstacles, chief among them the removal of the station's tower due to its proximity to a new heliport at the local hospital. The donation was made later in 1993. The new ownership, led by Carol Skaggs, set out to restore local radio service to Oakdale. Reclaiming the prior KREH call letters, the station built a new tower and returned to the air on October 12, 1994. One of its programs was a weekly swamp pop show hosted by Tommy McLain. ===Moving to Houston=== However, the local radio station would not last very long. In 1997, Skaggs filed to sell KREH to Jeffrey Eustis for $30,000. After the sale, the former studios were used as a recording studio, where McLain cut one of his albums. That August, Eustis filed to move KREH from Oakdale to Pecan Grove, Texas, west of Houston, where the station would broadcast with 2,500 watts in the daytime and 100 watts at night. Eustis then sold the station two years later, before completion of the Pecan Grove facility, to Bustos Media for $750,000. KREH launched from Pecan Grove in November 1999 and immediately began airing the brokered Vietnamese-language programming which it has aired since. Radio Saigon Houston, which is co-owned by Dương Phục and Vũ Thanh Thủy, started at the same time with five employees, growing to over 80 contributing hosts and 35 employees by 2007. (Archive) Growth of the station also prompted the station to move from its original Southwest Freeway studios to a new, custom-built facility on Bellaire Boulevard. The Houston Chronicle cited the station as a factor in the migration of Vietnamese to Houston from the West Coast. ==Programming== Radio Saigon Houston produces a wide variety of Vietnamese-language programs, some of which are aired by other stations across the United States. Several programs are bilingual to attract younger audiences who prefer English and are less likely to listen to the station. ==See also== * History of Vietnamese Americans in Houston ==References== ==External links== *Radio Saigon Houston official website Category:1953 establishments in Louisiana Category:Asian-American culture in Houston Category:Radio stations established in 1953 REH Category:Vietnamese-American culture in Texas REH ","title":"KREH"},{"id":"7823688","text":"Cerchi coat of arms right Reliquary bust of Blessed Umiliana de 'Cerchi The Florentine banking family of the Cerchi, minor nobles of the Valdarno, with a seat especially at Acone near Pontassieve, settled in Florence in the early thirteenth century and increased their fortunes. The family became the heads of a consortium of the prominent Guelfs that securely controlled Florence after the battle of Benevento in 1266. In Florence, the Cerchi purchased some of the ancient structures in the closely packed inner city formerly belonging to the counts Guidi, cheek-by-jowl with the proud Florentine family of the Donati, with whom their growing mutual antagonism was expressed in violent episodes that polarized Florence within a couple of decades in a virtual civil war that aligned behind two captains, Corso Donati of the Neri Guelf faction— the \\"Black\\" Guelfs of the old noble oligarchy— and Vieri de' Cerchi of the Bianchi, the moderate party that represented itself as champions of working people (the magri). The resulting violence lasted, with irruptions of tranquility, into the fourteenth century. In 1289 a plot had been intercepted at Arezzo, by which the city's bishop agreed to give over to the Florentines Bibbiena Civitella, and all the villages of his see, in return for a life annuity of 5,000 golden florins a year, guaranteed by the bank of the Cerchi. These rumors led to the confrontation of Guelfs and Ghibellines at the Battle of Campaldino, 11 June 1289, in which the young Dante Alighieri took part and Vieri dei Cerchi lost his life. In the popular uprising of 2 May 1299, the podestà Corso Donati was expelled, and with him the Donati faction. The Cerchi faction prevailed. In May the following year a brawl between Donati and Cerchi erupted, in which one of the Cerchi had his nose slit, but plots to restore Donati, who had become podestà of Orvieto, were unsuccessful. Matters were complicated when Pope Boniface VIII sent Charles de Valois, brother of the King of France to restore peace between Bianchi and Neri. He favoured the Neri: Dante, who had married Gemma Donati, was among those Bianchi dispossessed and banished in 1302, and marked Boniface as destined for the eighth circle of Hell in his Inferno. In Florence, the house of the Alighieri was a few hundred paces from the cluster of tower houses of the Cerchi, which were restructured in the fourteenth century to form a rambling Palazzo dei Cerchi in the isolated block (insula) fronting via dei Cimatori and via della Condotta behind Piazza della Signoria. This was the power center of the Cerchi: their church was the little Santa Margherita dei CerchiSanta Margherita is noted in a document of 1032. of which the arms of the patrons, Cerchi, Adimari and Donati, may still be seen on its thirteenth-century doorway. This was the church of Dante's Beatrice Portinari. The Palazzo, now renovated, has been the home of the study abroad program for Kent State University since 2003. Another palazzo dei Cerchi, facing into Piazza di Santa Croce, was entirely rebuilt in the seventeenth century as the Palazzo dell'Antella. The public charity and personal piety of Blessed Umiliana de' Cerchi (c. 1219-19 May 1246) became the object of a popular cult in Florence immediately after her death; it resulted in her beatification in 1634. ==Notes== ==References== *Benvenuti Papi, Anna. \\"Umiliana dei Cerchi: nascità di un culto nella Firenze de Duecento\\" in Studi Francescani (Turin: Società Editrice Internazionale, 1929-). 77 (1980) pp 87-117. *Touring Club Italiano, (1922) 1964.

An LSM consists of a large collection of units (called nodes, or neurons). Each node receives time varying input from external sources (the inputs) as well as from other nodes. Nodes are randomly connected to each other. The recurrent nature of the connections turns the time varying input into a spatio-temporal pattern of activations in the network nodes. The spatio- temporal patterns of activation are read out by linear discriminant units. The soup of recurrently connected nodes will end up computing a large variety of nonlinear functions on the input. Given a large enough variety of such nonlinear functions, it is theoretically possible to obtain linear combinations (using the read out units) to perform whatever mathematical operation is needed to perform a certain task, such as speech recognition or computer vision. The word liquid in the name comes from the analogy drawn to dropping a stone into a still body of water or other liquid. The falling stone will generate ripples in the liquid. The input (motion of the falling stone) has been converted into a spatio-temporal pattern of liquid displacement (ripples). LSMs have been put forward as a way to explain the operation of brains. LSMs are argued to be an improvement over the theory of artificial neural networks because: #Circuits are not hard coded to perform a specific task. #Continuous time inputs are handled \\"naturally\\". #Computations on various time scales can be done using the same network. #The same network can perform multiple computations. Criticisms of LSMs as used in computational neuroscience are that #LSMs don't actually explain how the brain functions.

The group included Montreal artists whose common interest was painting and an art for art's sake aesthetic, not the espousal of a nationalist theory as was the case with the Group of Seven or the Canadian Group of Painters. The group’s members included Alexander Bercovitch, Goodridge Roberts, Eric Goldberg, Jack Weldon Humphrey, John Goodwin Lyman, Moses “Moe” Reinblatt, and Jori Smith. Goldberg and Lyman were both well represented by Max Stern's Dominion Gallery in Montreal. By the late 1930s, many Canadian artists began resenting the quasi-national institution the Group of Seven had become. As a result of a growing rejection of the view that the efforts of a group of artists based largely in Ontario constituted a national vision or oeuvre, many artists - notably those in Quebec - began feeling ignored and undermined. The Eastern Group of Painters formed to counter this notion and restore variation of purpose, method, and geography to Canadian art. John Lyman's Contemporary Arts Society (1939–48) (in French, Société d'art contemporain) evolved out of the Eastern Group of Painters. ==References== * The Canadian Encyclopedia - Artists' Organizations Eastern Group of Painters Eastern Group of Painters Category:Arts organizations established in 1938 Category:1938 establishments in Canada ","title":"Eastern Group of Painters"},{"id":"7823731","text":"Authentic TV was a short-lived television home shopping channel in the United Kingdom.

She came from a prominent house of merchants and was married in her mid-adolescence as part of a political alliance that her ambitious father had engineered though her husband later died and she fled to become a Franciscan after her father pressured her into accepting a second marriage. Her beatification received approval from Pope Innocent XII on 24 July 1694 after the latter formalized her beatification in the recognition of the late Franciscan's local and enduring 'cultus' - or popular veneration. ==Life== Silver bust in Florence. Umiliana de' Cerchi was born in Florence in 1219 to a noble house to the prominent merchant Ulivieri de' Cerchi. Her father had six daughters - including her - and twelve sons. Her mother died when she was a child. One of her brothers held important public offices. Another brother was Arrigo and a sister was Ravenna. In her childhood she was prone to undertaking charitable initiatives that sought to benefit the poor and the sick and those that knew her best were firm in their belief that she was being called to the service of God rather than to that of the world. Her ambitious father however aimed for political alliances and the augmentation of the reputation of his name and so promised her in marriage to the nobleman Bonaguisi in 1235. Umiliana submitted to this desire and married him though found he was avaricious and often treated her as a mere servant and she would retaliate with a spirit of meekness and patience. The marriage was more of an economic partnership for her father. In secret she would distribute food and clothes to the poor. She bore two daughters. Her husband fell ill in 1240 and it was she who nursed him before he died at which point she ceded his entire fortune to his relations on the condition that his relatives make restitution for her late husband's injustices. Her two daughters then was received into the home of her late husband's relations for care. Her father was less than impressed with this and later sued her late husband's parents for the return of funds he gave to them at the time of the marriage. Umiliana retreated to her father's home and she later fled when he made repeated attempts to have her enter into a second marriage. The widow soon became a professed member of the Third Order of Saint Francis (at the convent of San Pietro a Monticelli) and henceforth led an austere life of solitude. She never left this solitude save for attending Mass or going out to visit the poor and the ill. This frustrated and even angered her father who decided to deprive her of whatever she still owned and he succeeded in doing this. Her confessor was the priest Michele Alberti. Umiliana was not ashamed to go out begging though she never used the alms for herself and instead distributed them to the poor. On one occasion she pleaded with the Lord to transfer the severe pain of an ill person to herself and she was later confined to her bed when the Lord appeared and restored her to health with the sign of the Cross. The widow also attended frequent Mass at the church of Saint Martin and she fasted on vital liturgical feasts as well as during Lent and Advent. Her brother Arrigo later became a third order Franciscan following his sister's example. Umiliana fell ill and she knew her end was close. Her confessor was at her bedside as she died in the dawn of 19 May 1246 on a Saturday. Her feet were bandaged before people filed in to view her mortal remains. Her remains were interred in one location though later moved behind a wall near the stairs of the pulpit. Her brother Arrigo arranged for a chapel to in the basilica to receive her remains. A total of 47 miracles were recorded in the period of 1246 to 1249 and she is perceived to be the first cloistered third order Franciscan in Florence. The chapel in the transept of the Basilica di Santa Croce is dedicated to her with a silver bust also there. It is also said that she is represented in Taddeo Gaddi's \\"Tree of Life\\" also in that same church. ==Beatification== The formal ratification of the late Franciscan's local 'cultus' - otherwise being popular and enduring veneration - allowed for Pope Innocent XII on 24 July 1694 to issue a decree that recognized this and thus approved her formal beatification. ==References== ==External links== *Saints SQPN Category:1219 births Category:1246 deaths Category:13th-century venerated Christians Category:13th- century Roman Catholics Category:13th-century Italian people Category:Franciscan beatified people Category:Italian beatified people Category:Italian Franciscans Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:Members of the Third Order of Saint Francis Category:People from Florence Category:Venerated Catholics ","title":"Umiliana de' Cerchi"},{"id":"7823738","text":"From Volume II of 1903's The Twentieth Century Bench and Bar of Pennsylvania Andrew Jackson Ogle (March 25, 1822 – October 14, 1852) was a Whig member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania.

The Ross–Littlewood paradox (also known as the balls and vase problem or the ping pong ball problem) is a hypothetical problem in abstract mathematics and logic designed to illustrate the seemingly paradoxical, or at least non-intuitive, nature of infinity. More specifically, like the Thomson's lamp paradox, the Ross–Littlewood paradox tries to illustrate the conceptual difficulties with the notion of a supertask, in which an infinite number of tasks are completed sequentially.\\"Imperatives and Logic\\", Alf Ross, Theoria vol. 7, 1941, pp. 53-71 The problem was originally described by mathematician John E. Littlewood in his 1953 book Littlewood's Miscellany, and was later expanded upon by Sheldon Ross in his 1988 book A First Course in Probability. The problem starts with an empty vase and an infinite supply of balls. An infinite number of steps are then performed, such that at each step 10 balls are added to the vase and 1 ball removed from it. The question is then posed: How many balls are in the vase when the task is finished? To complete an infinite number of steps, it is assumed that the vase is empty at one minute before noon, and that the following steps are performed: * The first step is performed at 30 seconds before noon. * The second step is performed at 15 seconds before noon. * Each subsequent step is performed in half the time of the previous step, i.e., step n is performed at 2 minutes before noon. This guarantees that a countably infinite number of steps is performed by noon. Since each subsequent step takes half as much time as the previous step, an infinite number of steps is performed by the time one minute has passed. The question is then: How many balls are in the vase at noon? == Solutions == Answers to the puzzle fall into several categories. ===Vase contains infinitely many balls=== The most intuitive answer seems to be that the vase contains an infinite number of balls by noon, since at every step along the way more balls are being added than removed. By definition, at each step, there will be a greater number of balls than at the previous step. There is no step, in fact, where the number of balls is decreased from the previous step. If the number of balls increases each time, then after infinite steps there will be an infinite number of balls. ===Vase is empty=== Suppose that the balls of the infinite supply of balls were numbered, and that at step 1 balls 1 through 10 are inserted into the vase, and ball number 1 is then removed. At step 2, balls 11 through 20 are inserted, and ball 2 is then removed. This means that by noon, every ball labeled n that is inserted into the vase is eventually removed in a subsequent step (namely, at step n). Hence, the vase is empty at noon. This is the solution favored by mathematicians Allis and Koetsier. It is the juxtaposition of this argument that the vase is empty at noon, together with the more intuitive answer that the vase should have infinitely many balls, that has warranted this problem to be named the Ross–Littlewood paradox. Ross's probabilistic version of the problem extended the removal method to the case where whenever a ball is to be withdrawn that ball is uniformly randomly selected from among those present in the vase at that time. He showed in this case that the probability that any particular ball remained in the vase at noon was 0 and therefore, by using Boole's inequality and taking a countable sum over the balls, that the probability the vase would be empty at noon was 1.Sheldon Ross, A First Course in Probability (Eighth edition, Chapter 2, Example 6a, p.46) ===Depends on the conditions=== Indeed, the number of balls that one ends up with depends on the order in which the balls are removed from the vase. As stated previously, the balls can be added and removed in such a way that no balls will be left in the vase at noon. However, if ball number 10 were removed from the vase at step 1, ball number 20 at step 2, and so forth, then it is clear that there will be an infinite number of balls left in the vase at noon. In fact, depending on which ball is removed at the various steps, any chosen number of balls can be placed in the vase by noon, as the procedure below demonstrates. This is the solution favored by philosopher logician Tom Tymoczko and mathematician logician Jim Henle. This solution corresponds mathematically to taking the limit inferior of a sequence of sets. The following procedure outlines exactly how to get a chosen n number of balls remaining in the vase. Let n denote the desired final number of balls in the vase (n ≥ 0). Let i denote the number of the operation currently taking place (i ≥ 1). Procedure: : _for_ i = 1 _to_ infinity: ::put balls numbered from (10*i - 9) to (10*i) into the vase :: _if_ i ≤ n _then_ remove ball number 2*i :: _if_ i > n _then_ remove ball number n + i Clearly, the first n odd balls are not removed, while all balls greater than or equal to 2n are. Therefore, exactly n balls remain in the vase. ===Problem is underspecified=== Although the state of the balls and the vase is well-defined at every moment in time prior to noon, no conclusion can be made about any moment in time at or after noon. Thus, for all we know, at noon, the vase just magically disappears, or something else happens to it. But we don't know, as the problem statement says nothing about this. Hence, like the previous solution, this solution states that the problem is underspecified, but in a different way than the previous solution. This solution is favored by philosopher of mathematics Paul Benacerraf. ===Problem is ill-formed=== The problem is ill-posed. To be precise, according to the problem statement, an infinite number of operations will be performed before noon, and then asks about the state of affairs at noon. But, as in Zeno's paradoxes, if infinitely many operations have to take place (sequentially) before noon, then noon is a point in time that can never be reached. On the other hand, to ask how many balls will be left at noon is to assume that noon will be reached. Hence there is a contradiction implicit in the very statement of the problem, and this contradiction is the assumption that one can somehow 'complete' an infinite number of steps. This is the solution favored by mathematician and philosopher Jean Paul Van Bendegem. == See also == * Supertask * Thomson's lamp * Zeno's paradoxes * Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel == References == == Further reading == * \\"Littlewood's Miscellany\\" (ed.

The directional signal is a result of protection that KYOK must afford the adjacent operating facility 1150 KZNE College Station, which signed on as WTAW in 1922. KYOK had a construction permit (CP) granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to move its transmission facilities from Conroe to Katy in an effort to cover more of the Houston Metropolitan area, and introduce night time service to the 1140 facility for the first time. KYOK would have dropped from its current licensed power of 5,000 watts to 800 watts daytime. Initial authorization for KYOK night power was to be 9 watts.

The call sign was changed to KYOK, to reflect the new ownership and alliance. This also brought an end to 1590's relationship with the Liberty Broadcasting System.

While still at 1590, from 1988 to 1992, KYOK was known as \\"The New YO! 1590 Raps\\" playing a hip hop music urban format. From the Fall of 1992 to the Fall of 1994, KYOK aired an Urban Adult Contemporary format as \\"AM 1590 The New KHYS, playing the Hits & Dusties\\", and was simulcast along with 103.3 KJOJ-FM and 98.5 KHYS. From Fall of 1994 to 1996, KYOK played Urban Oldies as \\"AM 1590 Solid Gold Soul\\". In late 1996, KYOK returned to Urban Gospel as \\"Gospel 1590 KYOK\\". This lasted until 1999, when the owners sold the 1590 facility to The Walt Disney Company/ABC Radio and switched it to the national network of Radio Disney children's programming. It got new call letters KMIC in July 1999, representing Mickey Mouse. The KYOK call sign and its Gospel format were moved to this facility, in August 1999, owned by Faith Broadcasting, Inc. Alvin \\"Brother Al\\" McCottry was 1140 KYOK's first general manager. Alan H. Lee served as the station's first program director and host of a midday talk show, also serving as its first program director. Both \\"Brother Al\\" and Alan Lee are often credited as major pioneers of the urban contemporary gospel radio sound. Disc jockeys included: Michael Mosley (mornings), Ed Grice (music director and afternoons), Seneca Gilbert (promotions director and middays), Jeffrey L. Boney a.k.a. \\"JBoney\\" (on-air personality and teen talk show host), Corliss A. Rabb (weekends), Adrienne Rowe (weekends), Barry \\"T\\" Thomas (Friday Night Praise party), Nzinga Rideaux, Anthony Valery, Eric Taylor and Gene Moore, Jr. Stacy Macardell was the first sales manager with Sheronda Harrell also in sales. The station was bought by Marin Broadcasting in 1992 for $175,000.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2010 page D-520 In the 2010s, it was acquired by Salt of the Earth Broadcasting, which also owns KZZB, KWWJ, and KANI in the Houston market.

It was first broadcast on Comedy Central on November 27, 2002, and was the last in a mini-arc depicting Cartman being occasionally possessed by Kenny. The episode is centered on Liane Cartman and Chef attempting to exorcise Kenny's soul while Stan deals with trying to debunk self-proclaimed psychic John Edward, whom the entire crew of South Park Studios agreed to be \\"the biggest douche in the universe.\\"Trey Parker and Matt Stone; The Biggest Douche in the Universe DVD commentary ==Plot== Cartman is rushed to the hospital after again being possessed by Kenny, the first occurrence of which was in the episode \\"A Ladder to Heaven\\" when he mistook Kenny's ashes for chocolate milk mix. The doctor tells his mother Liane that Cartman is 'running out of time'. Upon hearing of all this, Chef decides to take everyone to the Crossing Over TV show in New York and have John Edward talk to Kenny from beyond the grave. At the show, Edward merely makes uselessly vague statements about Kenny, and advises Kyle that his grandmother wants him to \\"look for four white doves.\\" Disappointed with Edward, Chef takes Cartman to his parents in Scotland and has them perform an exorcism. About to fly back to Colorado, Kyle spots a poster advertising a school called Jewleeard, with four white birds as its logo. Convinced, he rushes off to enroll himself. Stan goes to Edward's house, and offends him by trying to get him to admit that what he does is not real, and calls him a \\"douche\\" and \\"the biggest douche in the universe\\". Before Stan leaves, he steals some of Edward's books, to learn more about cold reading. In an attempt to persuade Kyle that Edward is a fake, Stan demonstrates cold reading on some passersby as they stand in the street but the plan backfires when the crowd believes that Stan actually has psychic powers, and he is immediately given his own show. This prompts Edward to challenge Stan to a psychic showdown. Meanwhile, Chef's parents successfully exorcise Kenny's spirit from Cartman, but since Chef has not brought a \\"victim child\\" into which to transfer the spirit, it flies around their house before occupying a pot roast. Cartman returns to his normal self and Chef's parents give him the roast to take back to South Park. However, Chef, Cartman, and Liane end up forgetting to claim the pot roast at the baggage claim in the airport. At the psychic showdown, Stan finally convinces Kyle and much of the audience that, although it may be comforting to think of their deceased relatives talking to them, such a fate isn't a particularly desirable one—especially if it means that they have to talk to Edward. A large spacecraft suddenly crashes through the studio roof. The nomination committee for the annual \\"Biggest Douche in the Universe\\" award, made up of several different aliens, comes to take Edward to the award ceremony for they have accepted Stan's nomination he unintentionally made earlier. Once taken there, Edward wins the prize despite throughout the entire episode yelling \\"I am not a douche!\\"—beating a variety of aliens including one that is literally a giant douche. Throughout the episode, fictional trailers play for Rob Schneider's latest comedy vehicles. Near the end of the episode a trailer is shown wherein Schneider finds the abandoned pot roast and eats it, thus allowing Kenny's spirit to possess him. The resulting movie shows him living out Kenny's former life until he is shot and impaled on a flag pole. == Production == At the time of this episode's original broadcast, Rob Schneider was about to star in The Hot Chick, and had already starred in The Animal. The running gag is that all of the fictional trailers follow the same basic plot: a man is somehow transformed, whether it be into an animal, a woman, a stapler, or a carrot. This point is furthered in the episode with a trailer clearly showing a plot exactly the same as these, but with almost every word spoken in complete gibberish. The term derp that is used in one of the Rob Schneider trailers (and would later become a popular term on the Internet) was coined when South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone were shooting the movie BASEketball; a derp is \\"a stupid joke that you could see a mile away,\\" commenting on their criticism of Schneider's movies. Mr. Derp, for example, was the name of Chef's replacement in \\"The Succubus\\". Asked about being parodied on South Park, Schneider responded in an About.com interview: \\"I loved it. That was genius. I thought the only thing, they were too nice to me ... When you're spoofed by the best people in the business, that's an honor.\\" The episode title, \\"The Biggest Douche in the Universe,\\" refers to the self-proclaimed psychic John Edward, and was referred to by Penn Jillette in his and Teller's show, Penn & Teller: Bullshit!. Penn and Teller are friends of Trey Parker and Matt Stone and have stated that this is their favorite episode. According to the commentary for this episode, Trey Parker described the creation of the episode as being centered on John Edward who the entire crew of South Park Studios agreed was \\"the biggest douche in the universe.\\" That was until Matt Stone asked the question \\"Well, what about Rob Schneider?\\" leading to the fictional trailers. Parker and Stone credit James Randi with Stan's explanation of cold reading. ==References== ==External links== * The Biggest Douche In The Universe Full episode at South Park Studios * The Biggest Douche In The Universe Episode guide at South Park Studios * * Category:Television episodes about exorcism Category:Television episodes about ghosts Category:Television episodes set in Scotland Category:South Park (season 6) episodes Category:Television episodes about psychic powers Category:Television episodes about spirit possession Category:Television episodes set in New York City ","title":"The Biggest Douche in the Universe"},{"id":"7823851","text":"Moses Hampton (October 28, 1803 – June 27, 1878) was a Whig member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania. ==Biography== Moses Hampton was born in Beaver, Pennsylvania.

The Mount Prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. ==History== The Mount Prison was designed as a Category C Training prison built on the site of the former Bovingdon RAF station. However, when the establishment opened in 1987, it was used as a Young Offenders Institution for males aged 18 to 21. Today the prison is used to hold Category C adult male prisoners. In November 1994, two inmates escaped from The Mount in a violent break-out. The pair attacked a civilian instructor, tied him up and fled from the bricklaying workshop being held inside the prison. The instructor was taken to hospital suffering from a fractured skull. In February 2005, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons condemned The Mount Prison, claiming that the jail's drug problem was out of control and threatened the security and safety of prisoners. According to the report, nearly half of the inmates said they felt unsafe, 25% had been victims of bullying, and another 44% said that it was easy to obtain illegal drugs. The inspection also found significant tensions among ethnic minorities at the prison and unclean conditions. In 2007, The Mount Prison partnered with Hertfordshire Highways to have inmates repair damaged roadwork signs. The prison announced the contract under which offenders who are learning metalwork, welding and painting skills will repair the broken road signs. In January 2013, the Ministry of Justice announced that an additional houseblock will be constructed at The Mount Prison, increasing the overall capacity of the jail. In April 2015, a prisoner was stabbed with a shard of glass and almost bled to death. In the summer of 2016, the prison's Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) reported that, \\"all the ingredients were in place for The Mount to suffer disorder such as has been experienced in other prisons – staff shortages, readily available drugs, mounting violence\\". In July 2017, riot-trained staff were brought into Mount Prison to deal with a disturbance; for a time prison staff had lost control of two wings, but order was later restored. Another incident ensued the following day, when armed prisoners took control of Nash Wing and broke windows. ==The prison today== The Mount is a Category C prison for adult males. As of 31 August 2015, it had an operational capacity of 1,028. The regime at the prison includes full- and part-time education, workshops, training courses, farms and gardens, and a works department. Other features include listener groups (a community-based project to keep juveniles out of prison), a job skills course, and prisoner- led drug-free meetings. According to a report, Mount Prison experiences severe staff shortages, which inmates' relatives have claimed results in prisoners being locked in their cells over weekends. The Mount was given the second lowest rating out of four by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS), which said performance was \\"of concern\\". In November 2016, the drug problem was seemingly at its worst and many prisoners suffered serious health effects which led to 70 emergency callouts during the month, mainly drug-related. Spice is a \\"big concern\\" according to prison staff. Staff have left due to uncompetitive salaries, and many of the empty posts have remained unfilled. An IMB report said: “Experienced staff have left and not been fully replaced, so that at the end of February there were 24 vacancies out of a complement of 136 officers, and a high proportion of officers and managers had less than two years’ experience.” ==References== ==External links== * Ministry of Justice pages on The Mount Mount Mount Mount Mount ","title":"HM Prison The Mount"},{"id":"7823867","text":"NSHS as an acronym can refer to many High Schools: *North Salem High School - Salem, Oregon *North Stafford High School - Stafford, Virginia *New School High School - Monmouth County, New Jersey *Newman Smith High School - Carrollton, Texas *North Scott High School - Eldridge, Iowa *Newton South High School - Newton, Massachusetts *North Springs High School - Sandy Springs, Georgia *North Shore High School - Glen Head, New York *North Shore High School - Harris County, Texas *New Salem High School - North Dakota *Ninety Six High School - Ninety-Six, South Carolina *North Sanpete High School - Mt.

It is situated at the corner of Nørregade and Sankt Peders Stræde in the city's Latin Quarter. Built as a single-nave church in the mid-15th century, it is the oldest building in central Copenhagen. It is also notable for its extensive complex of sepulchral chapels. ==History== St. Peter's Church was in the Middle Ages one out of four Catholic parish churches in Copenhagen. It is first mentioned in 1304 but was most likely founded in the 12th century. The first church burnt down in 1380 but was rebuilt shortly thereafter. After the Reformation the church building was for a while used as a canon and bell foundry. de Thurag's Hafnia Hodierna Frederick II presented St. Peter's Church to his German-speaking subjects in 1585. The building was renovated by Hans van Steenwinckel the Elder who also added a gablet upper floor to the uncompleted tower, which was however replaced by a spire in the 17th century. The church became a centre for Copenhagen's political, economic, cultural and military elite, which, like the Royal Court, relied on German for everyday use. St. Peter's Church The rapidly growing congregation made it necessary to expand the church in several stages. Christian IV added a northern transept in 1631 and a southern transept in 1634. Just 60 years later, Christian V extended the north transept with a further three severies. The distinctive sepulchral chapels arose between 1648 and 1740. St. Peter's Church was severely damaged in the Copenhagen Fire of 1728. The interior was lost to the flames but the outer walls were left intact and the church could fairly easily be rebuilt by Johan Cornelius Krieger. The church was first given a short lantern spire which was replaced by the current copper-clad spire in 1756-57. The spire survived the British bombardment during the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807. With the increasing tensions between Denmark and Germany in the middle of the 18th century, culminating in the First Schleswig War from 1848 to 1850, the church lost its special position and therefore members, prestige and financial support. As time passed, it became an impossible task for the congregation to maintain the large building complex, and in 1994 the state took over the church back into its care. It was transferred to the Palaces and Properties Agency, which in the late 90s carried out extensive restoration and partial restructuring under the direction of architect and professor Hans Munk Hansen. ==Architecture== St. Peter's Church was originally built as a single-nave church but with Christian IV's addition of the northern and southern transepts, it received the cruciform layout which characterizes it today. Most of the church, including the nave, the choir and the lower part of the tower, dates back to the middle of the 15th century. The main entrance is located in the southern transept and is marked by a richly carved Baroque portal from 1731, carved by the sculptor Diderik Gercken. The spire from 1756 to 1757 is built in the Rococo style to the design of carpenter ==Sepulchral chapels== Interior of the chapel The church has an extensive complex of sepulchral chapels which was commenced in 1643 and not completed until 1681-83 when Hans van Steenwinckel the Youngest completed a three wing chapel towards Larslejstræde. The complex contains numerous tombs and epitaphs of important German families in Denmark. Beneath the tombs contain the sarcofages of the most distinguished family members while other coffins are placed in three to four layers in underground crypts. ==Interments== ===Chapel=== Many of the chapels are made by Johannes Wiedewelt and Andreas Weidenhaupt.

As a player, he made 747 appearances in the Football League in a career that spanned 22 seasons, playing for Oldham Athletic (two spells), Huddersfield Town, Stockport County (two spells), Bradford City, Rochdale and Preston North End, and also spent a season in the North American Soccer League with the San Jose Earthquakes. As a manager, he took charge of Stockport County and Preston North End. After his spell in club management he became a long-standing kit manager for Manchester City before moving to his current role as a presenter and content producer for the club's media department. He also had a brief cameo in the song \\"Parklife\\" by Blur. ==Playing career== ===Early years=== Chapman was born in Oldham, Lancashire, growing up in nearby Royton, and as a youngster played for Chadderton Boys before going on to play for Huddersfield Town's youth team during his schooldays. He spent the first months of his working life as a trainee accountant with Middleton Council before being recommended to Oldham Athletic, where he signed as a professional. He made his first-team debut as an 18-year-old against Bristol Rovers in February 1967, but went back to Huddersfield Town in September 1969. ===Back at Oldham=== In December 1974, he returned to Oldham Athletic, now in Division Two. He stayed at the club for the next four and a half years, during which they climbed back up to the Second Division. Chapman missed only five games during that time and it came as a surprise to many when he left at the end of the 1978–79 season. In total, he made 263 league appearances for Oldham Athletic and scored 20 times. ===Later years=== Upon leaving Oldham, Chapman spent the summer of 1979 playing in the North American Soccer League for San Jose Earthquakes before returning to England and to Stockport County. After one season at Edgeley Park, Chapman left to sign for Bradford City. He spent four seasons at Valley Parade making 139 league appearances, before leaving on a free transfer for Rochdale where he spent two seasons, playing nearly 100 games for the Spotland side. His career at Preston saw him a regular in the team during their successful promotion season of 1988, and he scored the winning goal in an away match at Leyton Orient that confirmed their promotion. For that reason he is still fondly remembered by PNE supporters. A fanzine \\"53 miles West of Venus\\" was published for several years afterwards following Chapmans immediate comments about how he felt after the game. ==Management career== In July 1985 he became player-manager of Stockport County but moved on a year later to become player-coach under John McGrath at Preston North End. In 1990, he took over the managership of the club himself but was later sacked in October 1992.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. Albany Barracks is located next to Parkhurst, another Male/B prison and together they form HM Prison Isle of Wight. ==History== Albany was designed and built as a Category C Training Prison in the early 1960s occupying the site of Albany Barracks. Soon after opening in 1967, a decision was taken to upgrade Albany to a Category B prison and, in 1970, Albany became part of the dispersal system.http://www.justice.gov.uk/contacts/prison-finder/isle-of-wight It suffered major disturbances in 1972 which closed most of the Prison for over a year. In 1992, Albany was redesignated as a Category B Closed Training Prison. In January 1998 Albany changed from being half Vulnerable Prisoner Unit and half Normal Location, and is now exclusively used to house sex offenders and vulnerable prisoners. Albany also operates as an Assessment Centre for the core Sex Offender Treatment Programme. In August 2001 spikes (designed to stop birds perching) had to be removed from the exterior of Albany Prison after it was discovered that some of the spikes were coming loose. Prison Officers feared that inmates could use the spikes as a weapon against them. In May 2006 up to 60 prisoners at Albany Prison issued writs demanding compensation from the Home Office. The inmates demanded compensation because they were prevented from using the lavatory when security checks were being carried out. In March 2006 the kitchen providing meals to inmates at Albany prison was awarded a five-star rating for kitchen hygiene by the environmental health department of the Isle of Wight Council. The inspection of kitchens at 1,900 premises on the Isle of Wight, including schools, church halls, cafes and restaurants found Albany to have a top rating in standards of food preparation, ahead of establishments such as the Royal Yacht Squadron club. In October 2008, it was announced that the name Albany could be lost, along with the two other prison names, Parkhurst and Camp Hill. The three would become part of one large prison run by a single governor. New names for the larger single prison have been suggested as HMP Solent, HMP Mountbatten and HMP Vectis. HMP Isle of Wight was later selected as the new name for the super prison incorporating all three island prisons. In May 2010 a man dressed as Snoopy and an accomplice attempted to enter the Albany site, trying to free a prisoner. The pistol the costumed man carried was a water gun.

Retrieved on 13 July 2010. ===1972 disturbances=== The UK prisoners Union Preservation of the Rights of Prisoners had been founded on 11 May 1972. It had started organising peaceful protests in prisons across England. There were five protests between 11 and 13 June, including one in Albany. On 4 August there was an England-wide prison strike involving 10,000 prisoners, i.e. 25% of the total prison population. This included Albany. The Prison Officers Association found this disturbing. By the week of 21 August they had issued a six-point policy document called Get Tough. However Prison Officers in Albany rejected this as not being strong enough and demanded stricter punishments for every infringement of the regulations. This was backed up by threat of a work-to-rule and overtime ban if their demands were not met by 13 September. Further prison officers provided stories for the media of a \\"mafia- style\\" organisation amongst high-profile long term prisoners. Several were named: Charles Kray, Robert Welch, John Duddy, Ian Brady and Ray Morris. A deputation of Police Officers met with Governor, and shortly afterwards the Governor organised a lock-up and search of the entire prison, citing fears of a mass escape as the reason. ==Current status== Albany holds Category B/C sex offenders and vulnerable prisoners. Accommodation at Albany Prison comprises six wings (House Blocks 11–17), as well as a separate induction unit and an inpatient healthcare unit. All wings are identical and hold prisoners in single cells with in-cell but no toilet or sink. On each landing there are communal recesses housing toilets and wash basins. There are also payphones on each wing, and one TV room within each wing. The Isle of Wight College provides education at Albany Prison. A range of courses are available including Basic and Key Skills, Art and Craft, Information Technology, Food Hygiene, Business Studies, as well as Open University Courses. There are also vocational training programmes in: Bricklaying, Painting and Decorating, Horticulture, Industrial Cleaning, Woodwork and Tailoring. The prisons gym department also provides physical education courses as well as recreational gym.

His parents were Cristóbal López Sanchordi and Manuela Portaña Meer. Vicente López began formally studying painting in Valencia at the age of thirteen, he was a disciple of father Antonio de Villanueva, a Franciscan friar, and he studied at the Academy of San Carlos in his native city. He was seventeen when he won first prize in drawing and coloring receiving a scholarship to study in the prestigious Academia Real de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid. For the following three years in Madrid, he apprenticed with the Valencian painter, Mariano Salvador Maella. Vicente López returned to Valencia in 1794 and subsequently became vice-director of painting at the Academy where he had studied as a boy. In 1795 he married Maria Piquer, they had two sons: Bernardo and Luis, who were also painters, following their father's style but with little accomplishments. In 1801 López was named President of the Academy of San Carlos. == Court painter== J. Duart (R.A.B.A.S.F., Madrid). When king Charles IV visited the city of Turia in 1802, the king appointed him an honorary court painter at the same time he gave him some commissions that he executed successfully. He was already well known and regarded when in 1814 López was called to the court of Ferdinand VII, the Spanish king, who appointed him official court painter and received a royal appointment. Shortly thereafter he succeeded Goya as Royal Court Painter during the reign of Ferdinand VII, who also appointed him as drawing teacher of his second wife, Maria Isabella of Portugal, and later of his third wife, Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxony. In 1817 he was named President of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. Vicente López was a prolific painter executing many religious, allegorical, historic and mythological scenes, but he specialized in portraits. During his long career he painted nearly every notable person in Spain during the first half of the 1800s. In 1826, López painted a portrait of Francisco Goya when the famous master visited the court from Bordeaux, where the Aragonese painter was then living. Goya was then 80 and would die two years later. It was said that Goya got bored posing for his colleague who was very meticulous and a stickler for detail, and that for this reason the portrait is inferior to others by López. However, for this precise reason, and because of the strong personality of the model this is one of López's most lively and best-known works. Portrait of Francisco Goya, 1826. Vicente López spent the remainder of his life in Madrid painting portraits of statesmen, academics, and other important figures, as well as dramatic and emotional religious subjects. When he died, in Madrid, he was court painter of Queen Isabella II. He was seventy eight years old. == Style == Vicente López was a Neo-classicist painter but he retained certain traces of the Rococo style. He had the Neo-classical emphasis on masterly drawing, though with less rigidity. López is considered the best Spanish painter of his time, second only to Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes. One of his rivals was Agustín Esteve Marqués. Lopez's style is dominated by the influence of Anton Raphael Mengs and the Academicism, and he was unaffected by romanticism popular at the end of his career. López was very skilled in drawing and using the brush, but he did not achieve the level of genius that Goya did. His best works are probably his drawings and small-scale paintings. ==References== *Vicente López Portaña (1772–1850).

The former prison lies adjacent to Albany and Parkhurst, both part of HMP Isle of Wight. ==History== Camp Hill was built in 1912 using prisoner labour from Parkhurst Prison. Camp Hill was formally opened by Winston Churchill. In a report in April 2007, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised Camp Hill for its lack of a coherent and positive direction, and its failure to improve. Concerns were also raised at the number of inmates not in vocational work at the prison. Camp Hill courted controversy again weeks later, when it emerged an arsonist had been mistakenly released 29 months too early from the prison. In January 2008 a convicted drug dealer refused to leave his cell in Camp Hill for a court appearance. Citing the 1998 Human Rights Act, the prisoner claimed his human rights would be breached if he was forced to leave, due to fears he would lose his cell to another inmate amid an overcrowding crisis at Camp Hill. In October 2008, it was announced that the name Camp Hill could be lost, along with the two other prison names, Albany and Parkhurst.

It was laid out at the end of the 19th century and expanded in 1928 on the construction of a football ground on the site; which became the home of the town's football team. There was also a cricket pitch, athletics field and public playing field. Parts of the ground were affected by mining subsidence for much of the centre's existence. It was finally shut down on 25 May 1985 when a 40-foot wide hole appeared on the cricket pitch. All subsequent plans for sports to return to the centre had to be shelved due to ongoing problems with subsidence. By the early 1990s, Dudley Sports Centre was heavily overgrown and the site was fenced off for safety reasons, though no demolition work had yet taken place. On at least one occasion, gypsies moved onto the site before the local authority forced them to move on. Clearance of the site began in 1998, in preparation for the construction of the Castle Gate complex; which would operate as a business and leisure park. This project had been on the council's agenda for at least six years. In 2001, a McDonald's and Showcase cinema opened on the site, with Pizza Hut opening an outlet the following year.

Edsel, published in 2006 by Laurel Publishing. == Summary == This book focuses on an aspect of World War II that is largely ignored in many history books – the Nazi looting of Europe and Russia and the Allied recovery and repatriation of stolen art. Little known to the general public, Hitler diverted his attention from the prosecution of the war to the systematic theft of Europe's great art. His dream was to build the world's greatest collection – The Führermuseum – in his hometown of Linz, Austria. European museum officials took extraordinary measures to protect art from Hitler and the ensuing war. When U.S. forces prepared to enter Europe, they assembled a special force of largely American and British museum directors, curators, and art historians known as the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program (MFAA) section, attached to the Allied armies. These \\"Monuments Men\\" attempted to minimize damage to European monuments and architecture, and to track down stolen works of art. Their effort would become one of the greatest \\"treasure hunts\\" in history. In the end, Allied forces located more than 1,000 repositories in mines and castles across Europe, many of which were filled with art, sculpture, furniture, archives, and other cultural property stolen by the Nazis. Edsel notes that thousands of pieces are still missing, such as Raphael's Portrait of a Young Man from the Czartoryski Museum in Kraków, Poland. Rescuing Da Vinci tells this story through brief text and more than 460 photographs, 60 of which are in color. This group of photographs has never been published in a single book, and many have not been seen in decades. Images such as Michelangelo's David entombed in brick for protection or a Rembrandt Self Portrait sitting atop crates in a salt mine, capture the story in ways beyond words. == Organization == Forewords to Rescuing Da Vinci were written by Lynn Nicholas, author of The Rape of Europa (a scholarly book on the same subject), and Dr. Edmund Pillsbury, former director of the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. Nine chapters document the history from Hitler's artistic ideals and his premeditated theft of Europe to the formation of the MFAA and their recovery and restitution of thousands of works of art and other cultural properties. Edsel closes the book with a chapter on the destroyed and lost monuments and works of art that are a continued legacy of Hitler's destruction. Each chapter begins with several pages of text, followed by dozens of photographs with detailed captions. Also included are maps that mark the location of the Mona Lisa at all stages during the war, the location of all fourteen known Leonardo da Vinci paintings, and the locations of major Nazi repositories in Germany and Austria. == Themes == === Nazi destruction === While art theft is not commonly associated with the Nazi reign, and perhaps thought by some to be insignificant in comparison to the number of lives lost during World War II at the hands of Hitler, Edsel points out that it was another premeditated and destructive plan of the Nazis. By classifying contemporary artists and their work as \\"degenerate,\\" Hitler sought to rid Europe of what he considered to be undesirable artwork. Hundreds of paintings were removed from museums, many destroyed by Nazis in symbolic burnings. Catalogues reprinted in Rescuing Da Vinci list works of art in other countries which Hitler desired for his own museum, and that he was determined to obtain, by whatever means necessary. Edsel points out that the cultural loss inflicted by Nazi plundering cannot be ignored in discussing Nazi destruction. ===Jewish Holocaust=== This book also reveals often-ignored aspects of the Nazi plan to rid Europe of its Jewish population. Photographs showing warehouses of furniture and household items from pianos to children's toys, all of which had been looted from Jewish families, symbolize the reach and extent of the Holocaust. Museums and mines full of stolen paintings show the work of the ERR, the organization in France that \\"legalized\\" the seizure of Jewish collections and property. === Restitution === The effects of Nazi looting are still being felt in the early 21st century. Many victims and their families are just now having stolen paintings returned to them. Some of these cases, such as that of Maria Altmann, have made headlines. Rescuing Da Vinci shows the beginning stages of this restitution work, performed by the MFAA 60 years ago. Edsel argues that many more cases such as Altmann's will surface in the coming years. === Americanism === Rescuing Da Vinci points out the strengths and good deeds of the U.S. military. It also demonstrates the appreciation of foreign governments for the United States' actions. However, some argue that it relies too heavily on the effects of the American involvement. \\"Although Rescuing Da Vinci mentions Allied officers throughout Europe, the focus is primarily on Americans and could benefit from greater mention of European contributions.\\" (Shauna Isaac, The Art Newspaper) == Research == Edsel spent years researching the subject before writing Rescuing Da Vinci. He used researchers in more than a dozen countries to search foreign archives for photographs, as well as performing extensive research at the National Archives in College Park, Maryland. He and his team continue to research MFAA personnel in order to develop biographies on all and honor their achievements. == Reception == == Adaptations == A film, co-produced by Edsel and Actual Films, entitled The Rape of Europa, was released in November 2007. A related adaptation was The Monuments Men (2014), starring George Clooney, who produced and directed it, and a prominent cast. ==See also== *Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program == External links == * Official Website * Author's blog * Finding the \\" Missing \\" Monument Men - Research by Nancy Cunningham Category:2006 books Category:Art and cultural repatriation after World War II ","title":"Rescuing Da Vinci"},{"id":"7824070","text":"John Wilson Farrelly (July 7, 1809 – December 20, 1860) was an American politician from Pennsylvania who served as a Whig member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Pennsylvania's 22nd congressional district from 1847 to 1849. ==Biography== John Wilson Farrelly (son of Patrick Farrelly) was born in Meadville, Pennsylvania.

KYND is owned by Pro Broadcasting, Inc. ==History== 1520 KYND has been brokered for the majority of its existence. Having first been proposed in 1978 by original owner Matthew Provenzano, the facility was granted a construction permit as a Class D facility in November 1987, utilizing 500 watts daytime only, from a 4-tower array west of Telge Rd. The 4 towers were originally of identical height at 38.4 meters. The facility received a License to Cover, Facility #40696, on March 1, 1990. In 1993, KYND was upgraded to 3 kilowatts, daytime only, but with a Critical Hours power of 2.6 kilowatts. The current 25 kilowatt daytime operation was granted in 2012. KYND's Critical Hours power is licensed at 18 kilowatts. While KYND has attempted to acquire a Nighttime Authorization previously, and a Construction Permit was granted to give the facility its first night operations (at a power of only 2 watts from a location in SW Houston near U.S. 59) the plan was scrapped, given that the minuscule power level would serve an extremely small section of Houston, and certainly not cover the COL of Cypress, northwest of the major metropolitan area. KYND has broadcast in Vietnamese, Desi, English, and Spanish throughout its existence. It was briefly programmed with a classic hits music format after China Radio International (CRI) concluded its contractual lease agreement with Pro Broadcasting in December 2015, and on various other occasions when KYND has been unable to secure a paying client for the broadcast time that the ownership offers to interested parties. The station was leased in May 2016, by Synergy Broadcasting, who returned the longtime Urban Oldies and Talk programming that had previously aired on the 1430 KCOH radio until 2013, on the reincarnated KCOH on 1230 until 2015, and later on KJOZ until 2016. On December 22, 2016, Class D translator K260CH Dilley received a license to cover, rebroadcasting KYND programming. The owner of the licensed translator claims to be broadcasting KYND from its location in Dilley, Texas, something ownership of KYND had no prior knowledge of until it was licensed. The owner of the translator had attempted to move the station to Cypress, Texas, but permission was declined by the FCC. On September 11, 2017, KYND lost regular leased programming it had contracted with Synergy Broadcasting, when Synergy moved to KLVL in Pasadena.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. ==History== Wealstun Prison was formed from the almagamation of HMP Thorp Arch and HMP Rudgate on 1 April 1995; both built in 1965, on the site of ROF Thorp Arch). The amalgamation of two neighbouring establishments was an historic development for the Prison Service, and had the effect of creating a category C closed side and category D open side within one establishment. A great deal of building development has taken place at the prison in recent years, and has recently been completed. In June 2003, 20 prisoners were involved in a rooftop protest at Wealstun Prison. The inmates smashed windows and climbed up drainpipes and ledges to the roof of the jail. After 19 hours some of the prisoners came down from the roof, but some of the inmates lasted 30 hours on the roof before surrendering peacefully. In February 2004, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised Wealstun Prison for being mouldy, damp and infested with rats. The report made 135 recommendations for improvements at the jail, and stated that in parts of the prison there was no alarm system, basic repairs had been neglected and windows were smashed or missing. However following a more recent inspection, HMP Wealstun was highly praised for the work undertaken there. In 2008 due to Category C overcrowding problems in the prison service, HMP Wealstun was re-rolled from a Category C/D prison to a wholly Category C prison and as a result the open side of the prison closed, and was converted to provide additional category C accommodation. The new Category C area commenced operation in April 2010. In August 2010, an unannounced full inspection of the prison by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons stated that Wealstun \\"is clearly slipping backwards. The deterioration in safety is the most obvious example but there is a disturbing sense of lack of grip in other areas too. The issues identified in this report need to be addressed quickly and effectively to prevent them from becoming even more serious.\\" The report also made numerous recommendations. ==The prison today== Accommodation at Wealstun includes 15 double-occupancy cells on B Wing. The remainder of the Category C cells are single-occupancy covering 10 wings (A - J Wing). Wealstun offers education, workshops, training courses, farms and gardens and a works department. The prison has a Listener Scheme (supported by the Samaritans and prison officers) and a Community Integration Unit and work out scheme. Wealstun is served by Leeds North East Primary Care Trust, with a part-time medical officer and an on-call facility. HMP Wealstun also has extensive services and provisions in place to help with resettlement and reducing reoffending. Wealstun has a visitors' centre for use on visiting days, and a modern visiting room is in operation, which has play area facilities and a refreshment counter where food may be purchased. There is a non-denominational chapel which was dedicated on 1 November 2005.Harrogate Advertiser, New Chapel opens, published 2 November 2005, accessed 21 August 2018 HMP Wealstun opened fully as a category C establishment in April 2010 after the security building work was completed on the conversion of the category D part of the prison. ==Notable former inmates== * Owen Oyston ==References== ==External links== * Ministry of Justice pages on Wealstun Wealstun Wealstun Category:1995 establishments in England Wealstun ","title":"HM Prison Wealstun"},{"id":"7824161","text":"Joseph Henry Kuhns (September, 1800 – November 16, 1883) was a Whig member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania. ==Biography== Joseph H.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. ==History== Formerly a Naval Base, HMS Ceres, Wetherby was introduced into the Prison System in 1958 as a Borstal. Since that time there have been many changes in its role from an open Youth Custody Centre, to a closed Youth Custody Centre, to its current role as a dedicated Male Juvenile Prison housing inmates aged between 15 and 17 years. It houses offenders who are from Humberside, North, South and West Yorkshire and parts of Lancashire and Greater Manchester. Its functional capacity is 276 detainees, however, the Ministry of Justice list the operational capacity as being 336 detainees. ==The prison today== All living accommodation in the prison is in single occupancy cells. The living accommodation is split into 6 living units (Anson, Benbow, Collingwood, Drake, Exmouth & Frobisher) housing 60 trainees in each. There are two brick-built units that were built in the 1970s and 4 \\"quick- build\\" ready-to-use units that were erected in 1997. An additional self- contained unit for vulnerable boys in custody has officially opened in 2009 by the Youth Justice Board, the Keppel Unit holds up to 48 boys aged 15–17, offering enhanced support including individual care plans, extended enrichment opportunities exclusive to Keppel Unit; such as the weekly 'Park Run', where the trainees are offered the chance to stroll or compete for lap times around the pond and surrounding recreational pitches, and small animals where the trainees can handle and assist in the caring of rabbits & the various breeds of duck. The enhanced supervision unit (ESU), Napier, was opened in 2019 able to provide additional care and support for 6 young males. Wetherby's Education Programme (offered on a half-time basis) is provided by Novus. Courses are provided in a variety of subjects and individual timetables are developed to meet the trainees' needs in conjunction with the sentence planning process. The establishment has a Chaplaincy Team for both staff and trainees. There are weekly services, an Ecumenical Service for Church of England and other Free Churches, a Roman Catholic service as well as Muslim prayers and non-exclusive prayer sessions for those of other faiths.

The prison has a small Health Care Centre which is run by nursing staff who provide 24-hour medical cover. A doctor attends the establishment in the mornings. Refreshments are available to visitors and prisoners in the visits room during visiting hours and vending machines are also available. ==2016 lockdown== In February 2016, it was revealed that all of the detainees were on lockdown due to rising levels of violence against staff and other detainees.

He was the youngest among the sharana leaders and grew up in the household of Basavanna as he was the son of Nagalambike, Basava's own sister. He also wrote the Karana Hasuge which is one of the most sacred texts of the Lingayats, among many vachanas. He propounded the \\"shatasthala\\" philosophy associated with the six holy places of Veerashaiva Lingayat creed. He succeeded to the Shunya Simhasana at Anubhava Mantapa, Kalyana after the departure of Allama Prabhu, circa 1162ad. His young shoulders carried on the legacy of Basava after the latter's departure to Kudalasangama in 1162ad. He is credited to have systematised the entire manual of simple rituals for the followers. He was a strong advocate of the Ishtalinga wearing and expounded the material as well as the esoteric meaning of that divine symbol. He held together the nascent group of Shivasharanas and Jangmas in tumultuous times of clashes with the orthodox Brahmins and heretic Jains. Following the assassination of Kalachuri King Bijjala II in 1167 A.D, Channabasava along with his followers migrated to Ulavi safeguarding the Vachana literature. He attained Samadhi state there at the age of 25 passing on the leadership of the movement to Siddarama. A sacred temple of Channabasavanna is located at Ulavi in Karwar District (Uttar Kannada) of Karnataka State, India. The temple of Channabasavanna faces the east. In front of the temple there is a spacious lake. The lake is filled with lotus flowers and hence very attractive. Devotees coming from different parts of the country, take a dip in the holy waters and are absolved of all their sins and impurities. Thrice a day the Mahasamadhi of Channabasavanna is worshipped with all pomp and ceremony. On the Samadhi is placed the face of Nandi. To the left is Sangameshwar, to the right Mallikarjuna and to the right of Mallikarjuna is Basavanna. The Mantap outside the temple is very beautiful. To the east and to the south there are doors. The door of the sanctum is to the east.

Burnett and Parker took control of the project and involved noted Splatterpunk author and screenwriter David J. Schow to do a page one rewrite of the original Fever Dreams script. Following this, they produced a two-minute \\"teaser\\" trailer to sell Parker's directorial vision for the film. Impressed with their efforts, director Bryan Singer called Warner Premiere's Diane Nelson to inform her of the project.

The prison is located in the village of Appleton Thorn (near Warrington) in Cheshire, England. Thorn Cross is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. ==History== Thorn Cross Prison opened in 1985, on the site of the former RNAS Stretton (HMS Blackcap) airfield. Thorn Cross was initially used as an open prison for adult males. In 1996, the prison was re-rolled as a Young Offenders Institution. At the time, Thorn Cross was the first such institution in the United Kingdom to enforce military-style disciplinary regime for some of its inmates, which led to a part of the prison (unit 5) being labelled a boot camp. In January 1999, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons labelled Thorn Cross Prison as an inspirational example of good practice. In particular the report praised the prison's High Intensity Training (HIT) project, and recommended it be rolled out to other prisons. In October 2005, a further inspection report highly praised Thorn Cross Prison, again highlighting the prisons HIT program. The report also noted that Thorn Cross managed to reduce re-offending amongst its ex-inmates to just over 20 per cent, one of the best rates in the country. The report added that the prison had to do more to improve relations with the local community however. ==Present day== HM Prison Thorn Cross is a Category D Adult Male Institution for males aged 21+. Accommodation consists of single rooms, each prisoner having his own room key. Education and training courses offered at the prison include Construction Crafts, Motor Vehicles, Horticulture, Hospitality and Catering and Rail Construction (NVQ Level 2).

The station is owned by Entercom and carries a sports radio format. KILT shares its call sign with its sister station KILT-FM 100.3 FM, which airs a country music radio format. Its studios are located in the Greenway Plaza district. KILT is powered at 5,000 watts. It uses a directional antenna at all times. The transmitter is on West Road at Ella Boulevard in North Houston.Radio-Locator.com/KILT-AM Programming is also heard on an HD Radio subchannel on co-owned 100.3 KILT-FM-HD2. ==Programming== On weekdays, KILT has local hosts from morning drive time through the evening, with CBS Sports Radio syndicated national programming heard late nights and weekends. KILT is the flagship station of the NFL's Houston Texans and the MLS' Houston Dynamo. It has aired every Texans game since the team's inception into the league in 2002. ==History== ===KLEE=== 610 AM signed on the air on January 31, 1948. It was owned by W. Albert Lee. The station chose the call sign KLEE to reflect the owner's name. The studios were in the Milby Hotel, which Lee owned. The following year, Lee added a television station, Channel 2 KLEE-TV. It was Houston's first television station and the second one in Texas. Lee sold Channel 2 to the Hobby Family in 1950, owners of the Houston Post daily newspaper, but he kept his radio station since the Post already owned AM 950 KPRC ===Gordon McLendon Ownership=== In 1952, KLEE was sold to Gordon McLendon, who initially changed the call letters to KLBS, to represent his network, the \\"Liberty Broadcasting System.\\" McLendon had great success programming Top 40 hits on KLIF 1190 in Dallas. That prompted McLendon to turn other stations in his chain into Top 40 outlets, including AM 610 in Houston, in 1957. The station took the call letters KILT as a nod to McLendon, who often called himself \\"The Old Scotsman\\" on the air. (Scottish men are known for wearing kilts instead of pants.) For 24 years, KILT was the leading Top 40 station in Houston, called \\"The Big 610 KILT\\". It used PAMS jingles that featured the call letters being sung out over the air. Notable personalities in the 1960s and 70s included Steve Lundy, Sheila Mayhew, Beau Weaver, Jay West, K.O. Bailey, Barry Kaye, Captain Jack and others. ===Flip to Country=== On February 16, 1981, sister station KILT-FM dropped album rock for country during the \\"Urban Cowboy\\" craze that swept through Houston, and the United States in general. The AM station continued with its adult Top 40 sound. But in the 1980s, young listeners were increasingly tuning in FM stations to hear their favorite hits. Competition from KRBE 104.1 FM and KRLY 93.7 FM prompted KILT to end its Top 40 format. On June 1, 1981, KILT AM 610 switched to country music, partially simulcasting KILT-FM, then known as \\"FM 100\\". Over time, KILT AM played more classic country titles among current and recent hits, while KILT-FM concentrated on current country music. KILT AM included more news and features while KILT-FM stressed its more-music approach. But the same morning show was heard on both stations. In 1989, KILT-AM-FM were acquired by Westinghouse Broadcasting.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1993 page B-350 Westinghouse kept KILT as an AM country station for another five years. But as AM radio declined as a source for music, management decided to make a change. ===SportsRadio 610=== The current sports-talk format debuted in September 1994.Terry Blount, \\"'KILT to become city's first all-sports station\\", The Houston Chronicle, September 8, 1994. SportsRadio 610's 20th Anniversary Page, CBS Radio (September 10, 2014) The moniker for the new format was \\"Star 610 SportsRadio KILT.\\" The initial hosts were Mike Edmonds & Ed Fowler in the afternoon from 4-7 p.m. and the Bob Stevenson Outdoors Show, airing Tuesday-Friday mornings 4am-5am and Saturdays & Sundays from 4am-7am. Prime Sports Radio, based in Dallas, aired for all other hours. In 1995, Edmonds & Fowler moved to the mornings 6am-9am and Rich Lord & Kenny Hand were paired together for \\"Section 610\\" from 4pm-7pm. Lord and Hand also alternated hosting the locally produced Astros 10th Inning Shows on 610 from 1995–97. KILT's main competition is 790 AM KBME which switched to Sports Talk programming in 2004. A rimshot FM station, 97.5 KFNC, licensed to Mont Belvieu, Texas, halfway between Houston and Beaumont, switched to ESPN Radio in 2007. Before KBME moved from Adult Standards, KILT was the only sports station in the Houston market and was the radio home for the Houston Rockets, Houston Texans, and Houston Comets franchises. In recent years, KILT lost the rights to air Houston Rockets basketball games to KBME, and the WNBA Comets folded. ===Entercom ownership=== On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. KILT has remained Houston's top rated sports station for most of its history. Co-owned 650 KIKK carries the CBS Sports Radio Network in the daytime, while 610 KILT runs local sports shows. Late nights and weekends, KILT carries CBS Sports Radio programming. ===Controversy=== In 2007, a lawsuit was filed by then morning show co-host John Granato against CBS. This ultimately led to Granato leaving 610 and starting a new station: KGOW \\"1560 The Game.\\" Shortly thereafter, his co-host Lance Zierlein joined him at KGOW. In 2017 KGOW switched from Sports to Vietnamese language programming. == Past Personalities == Shaun Bijani (left) and Paul Gallant airing live from a sports collectors show in Houston. * Seth Payne, host * Ted Johnson, host * Wade Smith, host, * Booker T, host * Clint Stoerner, current afternoon host * Mike Meltser, host * Sean Pendergast, host * Rich Lord, host * John Lopez, host * Paul Gallant, host * Fred Davis, host * Landry Locker, producer * Chris Jones, producer * Brian McDonald, producer * Laura Reynolds, traffic & assistant program director * Ryan McCredden, program director * Shaun Bijani, host * Derek Fogel, host * Patrick McLellan, host * Jeremy Brahnam - Houston Dynamo play-by-play * Garret Heinrich - Houston Dynamo color analyst * Brad Wright - digital supervisor ==References== ==External links== *SportsRadio 610 KILT official website *FCC History Cards for KILT Category:Sports radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1948 Category:1948 establishments in Texas ILT (AM) Category:Houston Texans broadcasters Category:CBS Sports Radio stations Category:Entercom radio stations ","title":"KILT (AM)"},{"id":"7824306","text":"Henry Nes (May 20, 1799 – September 10, 1850) was an American medical doctor and politician. ==Biography== Nes was born in York, Pennsylvania.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. ==History== By 1814, the existing Cardiff Gaol was deemed insufficient for coping with both the scale of demand and quality of building to cope with the quickly expanding industrial town, and so proposals were made to build a new county jail for Glamorgan. Construction commenced in 1827, and the new stone building located south of Crockherbtown opened at the end of 1832, capable of housing 80 prisoners, including 20 debtors. The three Victorian wings of Cardiff Prison underwent a major refurbishment programme in 1996, and the prison’s capacity was extended by the commissioning of three new wings (C, D and E), with the number of places for life-sentenced prisoners increased also. In 1997 Cardiff Prison was criticised for chaining sick inmates to their hospital beds after a probe into the death of one of Cardiff's prisoners.https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-61126117 Three years later one of Cardiff's Assistant Governors was found dead after an investigation into child pornography. The manager had been arrested at the prison days earlier by detectives investigating the alleged misuse of a personal computer. Cardiff Prison was criticised in 2001 for its cell-share policy in the wake of an inmate's death. Prison officials were advised to carry out full checks on prisoners on their arrival, to prevent violent or even fatal incidents from occurring. A year later the prison was criticised again for its poor record in dealing with drug abuse and providing decent recreation facilities for inmates. ===Execution site=== A total of 20 judicial executions took place at Cardiff prison.

HIL simulation provides an effective platform by adding the complexity of the plant under control to the test platform. The complexity of the plant under control is included in test and development by adding a mathematical representation of all related dynamic systems. These mathematical representations are referred to as the “plant simulation”. The embedded system to be tested interacts with this plant simulation. ==How HIL works== A HIL simulation must include electrical emulation of sensors and actuators. These electrical emulations act as the interface between the plant simulation and the embedded system under test. The value of each electrically emulated sensor is controlled by the plant simulation and is read by the embedded system under test (feedback). Likewise, the embedded system under test implements its control algorithms by outputting actuator control signals. Changes in the control signals result in changes to variable values in the plant simulation. For example, a HIL simulation platform for the development of automotive anti-lock braking systems may have mathematical representations for each of the following subsystems in the plant simulation:T. Hwang, J. Rohl, K. Park, J. Hwang, K. H. Lee, K. Lee, S.-J. Lee, and Y.-J. Kim, \\"Development of HIL Systems for active Brake Control Systems\\", SICE-ICASE International Joint Conference, 2006. * Vehicle dynamics, such as suspension, wheels, tires, roll, pitch and yaw; * Dynamics of the brake system’s hydraulic components; * Road characteristics. ==Uses== In many cases, the most effective way to develop an embedded system is to connect the embedded system to the real plant. In other cases, HIL simulation is more efficient. The metric of development and test efficiency is typically a formula that includes the following factors: 1\\\\. Cost 2\\\\. Duration 3\\\\. Safety 4\\\\. Feasibility The cost of the approach should be a measure of the cost of all tools and effort. The duration of development and testing affects the time-to-market for a planned product. Safety factor and development duration are typically equated to a cost measure. Specific conditions that warrant the use of HIL simulation include the following: * Enhancing the quality of testing * Tight development schedules * High-burden-rate plant * Early process human factor development ===Enhancing the quality of testing=== Usage of HILs enhances the quality of the testing by increasing the scope of the testing. Ideally, an embedded system would be tested against the real plant, but most of the time the real plant itself imposes limitations in terms of the scope of the testing. For example, testing an engine control unit as a real plant can create the following dangerous conditions for the test engineer: * Testing at or beyond the range of the certain ECU parameters (e.g. Engine parameters etc.) * Testing and verification of the system at failure conditions In the above-mentioned test scenarios, HIL provides the efficient control and safe environment where test or application engineer can focus on the functionality of the controller. ===Tight development schedules=== The tight development schedules associated with most new automotive, aerospace and defense programs do not allow embedded system testing to wait for a prototype to be available. In fact, most new development schedules assume that HIL simulation will be used in parallel with the development of the plant. For example, by the time a new automobile engine prototype is made available for control system testing, 95% of the engine controller testing will have been completed using HIL simulation. The aerospace and defense industries are even more likely to impose a tight development schedule. Aircraft and land vehicle development programs are using desktop and HIL simulation to perform design, test, and integration in parallel. ===High-burden-rate plant=== In many cases, the plant is more expensive than a high fidelity, real-time simulator and therefore has a higher-burden rate. Therefore, it is more economical to develop and test while connected to a HIL simulator than the real plant. For jet engine manufacturers, HIL simulation is a fundamental part of engine development. The development of Full Authority Digital Engine Controllers (FADEC) for aircraft jet engines is an extreme example of a high-burden-rate plant. Each jet engine can cost millions of dollars. In contrast, a HIL simulator designed to test a jet engine manufacturer’s complete line of engines may demand merely a tenth of the cost of a single engine. ===Early process human factors development=== HIL simulation is a key step in the process of developing human factors, a method of ensuring usability and system consistency using software ergonomics, human-factors research and design. For real-time technology, human-factors development is the task of collecting usability data from man-in-the-loop testing for components that will have a human interface. An example of usability testing is the development of fly-by- wire flight controls. Fly-by-wire flight controls eliminate the mechanical linkages between the flight controls and the aircraft control surfaces. Sensors communicate the demanded flight response and then apply realistic force feedback to the fly-by-wire controls using motors. The behavior of fly- by-wire flight controls is defined by control algorithms. Changes in algorithm parameters can translate into more or less flight response from a given flight control input. Likewise, changes in the algorithm parameters can also translate into more or less force feedback for a given flight control input. The “correct” parameter values are a subjective measure. Therefore, it is important to get input from numerous man-in-the-loop tests to obtain optimal parameter values. In the case of fly-by-wire flight controls development, HIL simulation is used to simulate human factors. The flight simulator includes plant simulations of aerodynamics, engine thrust, environmental conditions, flight control dynamics and more. Prototype fly-by-wire flight controls are connected to the simulator and test pilots evaluate flight performance given various algorithm parameters. The alternative to HIL simulation for human factors and usability development is to place prototype flight controls in early aircraft prototypes and test for usability during flight test. This approach fails when measuring the four conditions listed above. Cost: A flight test is extremely costly and therefore the goal is to minimize any development occurring with flight test. Duration: Developing flight controls with flight test will extend the duration of an aircraft development program. Using HIL simulation, the flight controls may be developed well before a real aircraft is available. Safety: Using flight test for the development of critical components such as flight controls has a major safety implication. Should errors be present in the design of the prototype flight controls, the result could be a crash landing. Feasibility: It may not be possible to explore certain critical timings (e.g. sequences of user actions with millisecond precision) with real users operating a plant. Likewise for problematical points in parameter space that may not be easily reachable with a real plant but must be tested against the hardware in question. == Use in various disciplines == === Automotive systems === In context of automotive applications \\"Hardware-in-the-loop simulation systems provide such a virtual vehicle for systems validation and verification.\\"S.Raman, N. Sivashankar, W. Milam, W. Stuart, and S. Nabi, \\"Design and Implementation of HIL Simulators for Powertrain Control System Software Development\\", Proceedings of the American Control Conference,1999. Since in-vehicle driving tests for evaluating performance and diagnostic functionalities of Engine Management Systems are often time-consuming, expensive and not reproducible, HIL simulators allow developers to validate new hardware and software automotive solutions, respecting quality requirements and time-to-market restrictions. In a typical HIL Simulator, a dedicated real-time processor executes mathematical models which emulate engine dynamics. In addition, an I/O unit allows the connection of vehicle sensors and actuators (which usually present high degree of non-linearity). Finally, the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) under test is connected to the system and stimulated by a set of vehicle maneuvers executed by the simulator. At this point, HIL simulation also offers a high degree of repeatability during testing phase. In the literature, several HIL specific applications are reported and simplified HIL simulators were built according to some specific purpose.A. Cebi, L. Guvenc, M. Demirci, C. Karadeniz, K. Kanar, and E. Guraslan, \\"A low cost, portable engine electronic control unit hardware-in-the-loop test system\\", Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics, 2005.J. Du, Y. Wang, C. Yang, and H. Wang, \\"Hardware-in-the-loop simulation approach to testing controller of sequential turbocharging system\\", Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics, 2007. When testing a new ECU software release for example, experiments can be performed in open loop and therefore several engine dynamic models are no longer required. The strategy is restricted to the analysis of ECU outputs when excited by controlled inputs. In this case, a Micro HIL system (MHIL) offers a simpler and more economic solution.A. Palladino, G. Fiengo, F. Giovagnini, and D. Lanzo, \\"A Micro Hardware-In-the-Loop Test System\\", IEEE European Control Conference, 2009. Since complexity of models processing is dumped, a full-size HIL system is reduced into a portable device composed of a signal generator, an I/O board, and a console containing the actuators (external loads) to be connected to the ECU. ===Radar=== HIL simulation for radar systems have evolved from radar- jamming. Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) systems are typically used to create false targets to confuse the radar in the battlefield, but these same systems can simulate a target in the laboratory. This configuration allows for the testing and evaluation of the radar system, reducing the need for flight trials (for airborne radar systems) and field tests (for search or tracking radars), and can give an early indication to the susceptibility of the radar to electronic warfare (EW) techniques. ===Robotics=== Techniques for HIL simulation have been recently applied to the automatic generation of complex controllers for robots. A robot uses its own real hardware to extract sensation and actuation data, then uses this data to infer a physical simulation (self-model) containing aspects such as its own morphology as well as characteristics of the environment. Algorithms such as Back-to- RealityZagal, J.C., Ruiz-del-Solar, J., Vallejos, P. (2004) Back-to-Reality: Crossing the Reality Gap in Evolutionary Robotics. In IAV 2004: Proceedings 5th IFAC Symposium on Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. (BTR) and Estimation ExplorationBongard, J.C., Lipson, H. (2004) “Once More Unto the Breach: Automated Tuning of Robot Simulation using an Inverse Evolutionary Algorithm”, Proceedings of the Ninth Int. Conference on Artificial Life (ALIFE IX) (EEA) have been proposed in this context. ===Power systems=== In recent years, HIL for power systems has been used for verifying the stability, operation, and fault tolerance of large-scale electrical grids. Current-generation real-time processing platforms have the capability to model large-scale power systems in real-time. This includes systems with more than 10,000 buses with associated generators, loads, power- factor correction devices, and network interconnections. These types of simulation platforms enable the evaluation and testing of large-scale power systems in a realistic emulated environment. Moreover, HIL for power systems has been used for investigating the integration of distributed resources, next-generation SCADA systems and power management units, and static synchronous compensator devices. ===Offshore systems=== In offshore and marine engineering, control systems and mechanical structures are generally designed in parallel. Testing the control systems is only possible after integration. As a result, many errors are found that have to be solved during the commissioning, with the risks of personal injuries, damaging equipment and delays. To reduce these errors, HIL simulation is gaining widespread attention. This is reflected by the adoption of HIL simulation in the Det Norske Veritas rules.DNV.

As of 2014, the museum, along with the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, and the Africa Museum in Berg en Dal, together make up the National Museum of World Cultures. ==First ethnographic museum in Europe== The institution which was at first called the \\"Museum Japonicum\\". It was the first museum in Europe which was designed to demonstrate that collecting the artefacts of man could mean more than the mere accumulation of curiosities. From the very outset, this innovative institution incorporated at least four basic principles: collecting, scientific research, presentation to the public, and educational guidance.Otterspeer, W. (1989). Leiden Oriental Connections, 1850-1940, p. 391. In 1816 the Koninklijk Kabinet van Zeldzaamheden was formed in the Hague as an attempt to start a museum of scientific artifacts from around the world, based on royal collections and a large group of Chinese artifacts from private collections. Thanks to the early efforts of this organization, in the early 1830s, when Philipp Franz Balthasar von Siebold abandoned the political turmoil of revolutionary Belgium for the relative calm of the University of Leiden, he was inspired by the first museum director R.P. van de Kasteele to collect Japanese objects for his collection.Koninklijk Kabinet van Zeldzaamheden on Leiden University webpage The resulting gift of about 5,000 objects became the heart the new museum's holdings.Otterspeer, p. 289. Siebold's home in Leiden—and the objects he brought to Europe after eight years in Japan—was opened to the public in the early 1830s (today his collection is preserved in the SieboldHuis). The Dutch crown had previously purchased the smaller collections of Jan Cock Blomhoff in 1826 and Johannes Gerhard Frederik van Overmeer Fischer in 1832. These which were merged with what Siebold bestowed on King William I; and they became crucial elements in the creation of what became the Museum voor Volkenkunde, or Ethnographic Museum in Leiden in 1837. This institution would later evolve into the National Museum of Ethnology.RVM website: Home...>Collectie...>Collection History In 1843, Siebold also encouraged other Europeans to create ethnographic institutions similar to what was developing in Leiden. He urged \\"the importance of their creation in European states possessing colonies because these institutions could become a means for understanding the subject peoples and of awakening the interest of the public and of merchants -- all of which are necessary conditions for a lucrative trade which benefits all.\\"Carbonell, Bettina. (2004). Museum Studies: An Anthology of Contexts, p. 134, citing Siebold, Philipp. (1843). Lettre sur l'utilité des Musées Ethnographiques et sur l'importance de leur création dans états européens qui posèdents des Colonies, p. 10. ==Museum holdings== Maya belt plaque made of jadeite from Guatemala held by the museum. The collection today contains a large number of objects from Africa, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Latin America, North America, Oceania, and Asia. In developing the collection, the museum has devoted significant attention to acquiring material which illustrates the historical development of world cultures; but the genesis of the museum's holdings began with material garnered during the years Japan was officially closed except for one small island in Nagasaki harbor -- Dejima. ===Blomhoff collection=== As Opperhoofd (or chief trader) for the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie or VOC) at Dejima island in Nagasaki harbor from 1817 through 1823, Jan Cock Blomhoff was unique. Despite the Japanese \\"closed door\\" policy for Westerners (sakoku), he did transport his wife, Titia, and children to join him.Bersma Rene. (2002). Titia, the First Western Woman in Japan. The Japanese predictably responded by ejecting both Blomhoff and his family; but that experience did broaden the range of household goods and other objects he accumulated across the span of his stay in Japan. ===Fischer collection=== Johannes Gerhard Frederik van Overmeer Fischer began as a clerk at Dejima and he was later promoted to \\"Package House Master\\" (pakhuismeester). During the span of his stay in Japan, Fisher's access to Japanese culture was limited; but within his universe of contacts, he was able to amass a considerable collection of \\"ordinary\\" objects which were plausbily overlooked by others. This material was brought back to the Netherlands in 1829. In 1833, he published Bijdrage tot de kennis van het Japansche rijk (Contribution to the knowledge of the Japanese State).Frederiks, Johannes. (1888). Biographisch woordenboek der Noord-en Zuidnederlandsche letterkunde, p. 250. ===Siebold collection=== As a physician practicing Western medicine in Nagasaki (1823-1829), Philipp Franz von Siebold received payment in kind with a variety of objects and artifacts which would later gain unanticipated scholarly attention in Europe. These everyday objects later became the basis of his large ethnographic collection, which consisted of everyday household goods, woodblock prints, tools and hand-crafted objects used by the Japanese people in the late Edo period. Further information relating to this material was published in Siebold's Nippon. His professional interest was especially drawn to implements used in the practice of traditional Japanese medicine.Alpen, Jan. (1995) Oriental Medicine: An Illustrated Guide to the Asian Arts of Healing, p. 7. As of 2005, a separate museum located in one of Siebold's former houses, the SieboldHuis, houses part of the collection. ==Leiden plate== The Leiden plate is a Maya belt plaque and important historical artifact from Guatemala.

She’s met with a world that’s completely foreign to her: politicians and the military move freely about the city, and she views city residents as spoiled, snobbish and arrogant. In contrast, she comes from a rural area where the Icelandic Sagas of the Middle Ages constitute the majority of what people discuss and ponder and are viewed as more important than reality. These historical backgrounds are certainly important and provide crucial patterns. The prime minister subsequently carries out secret dealings with the Americans and “sells” the country. Ugla, however, also confronts other current issues, above all in the organ player’s house. There, she comes in contact with communist and anarchist mindsets and likewise protests the construction of an atom station in Iceland. After a short relationship with Búi Árland, Ugla decides to return to the “selfconscious policeman”, who is the father of her recently born child. ===Cast=== ====In Eystridalur==== * Ugla Falsdóttir, her mother and father * The priest ====At the home of Búi Árland==== * Búi Árland * Búi's wife * Búi's cook and her daughter * Their children: Arngrímur (Landaljómi), Guðný (Aldinblóð, 'Fruit-Blood'), Þórður (Gullhrútur, 'gold ram'), Þórgunnur (Daggeisli) * Visiting politicians: the Prime Minister, Óli fígúra, other politicians, and Americans ====At the Organist's house==== * Organistinn (The Organist) * The Organist's mother * Kleopatra * benjamín the atom-poet (a god) (mafía F.F.F.) * briljantín the atom-poet (a god) (mafía F.F.F.) * Tvö hundruð þúsund naglbítar ('Two hundred thousand pliers') (mafía F.F.F.) * Lögreglumaður feiminn ('The Selfconscious Policeman') * Lögreglumaður ófeiminn ('The Unselfconscious Policeman') == Background == The Atom Station, written in 1946 and 1947, was published in 1948. The historical background of the novel is the British and later American occupation of Iceland during World War II, including the urbanisation and monetization of the Icelandic economy it stimulated. Many viewed Iceland’s independence as threatened due to the United States’ request in 1946 to establish a military base in Keflavík for 99 years, and pressure on Iceland to join NATO. Laxness was critical of the fact that Icelandic jurisdiction was not applicable to the area within the military base. But above all, he saw a threat to Icelandic life, because, in the event of an atomic war, Iceland would become a potential target due to the military base. These fears are based on the impression left by the two atomic bombs which had been recently dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Laxness began writing the novel shortly after these events; however, the Icelandic Parliament (the Althing) eventually agreed to the request and concluded the Keflavík Contract, provoking the 1949 anti-NATO riot in Iceland. Many of the characters in the novel can be understood as satires of real figures in Icelandic business and politics at the time, or otherwise modelled on Laxness's friends and acquaintances, though the work is too sophisticated simply to be read as a roman à clef.Peter Hallberg, Halldór Laxness (Twayne, 1971), pp. 163--64. According to Laxness's biographer Hannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson,'Segir Atómstöðina eiga sér fyrirmynd í tékkneskri bók', Morgunblaðið, 22.10.2004, http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2004/10/22/segir_atomstodina_eiga_ser_fyrirmynd_i_tekkneskri_b/. * One model for the main character, Ugla, was Arnheiður Sigurðardóttir. * The Organist was inspired primarily by Laxness's friends Erlendur Guðmundsson í Unuhúsi (to whom the book is dedicated) and Þórður Sigtryggsson. * The main models for Búi Árland would mainly be Guðmundur Vilhjálmsson, the chairman of Eimskip, and Pálmi Hannesson, rector of Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík. * The Prime Minister is based on Ólafur Thors (and the novel, amongst other things, a transparent attack on Ólafur). * Landaljómi is based on Thor Vilhjálmsson. * The god Briljantín is based on Ragnar Frímann Kristjánsson * Kleópatra's model is Guðmunda Sigurðardóttir. * Tvö hundruð þúsund naglbítar (Two Hundred Thousand Pliers) is a combination of Sigurjón Pétursson and Jóhann Þ. Jósefsson. ==Reception== First English-language edition Early Icelandic reviewers read the book primarily as a satire on the politics of the day; it has traditionally been seen as one of Laxness's weaker works,Giuliano D’Amico, 'The Whole World Is One Atom Station: Laxness, the Cold War, Postcolonialism, and the Economic Crisis in Iceland', Scandinavian Studies, 87 (2015), 457-88 (p. 459), https://muse.jhu.edu/article/616175. though it has long been read as Iceland's first urban novel, foreshadowing the prominence of Reykjavík in more recent literature.Ástráður Eysteinsson and Úfhildur Dagsdóttir, 'Icelandic Prose Literature, 1940--2000', in A History of Icelandic Literature, ed. by Daisy Nejmann, History of Scandinavian literatures, 5 (University of Nebraska Press: 2007), pp. 404--70 (p. 411). However, more recent critics have seen it as offering more enduring theological,John Macqueen, “Theology and The Atom Station”, in Afmæliskveðjur heiman og handan. Til Halldórs Kiljans Laxness sextugs, ed. by Jakob Benediktsson, Sigurður Þórarinsson, Kristján Karlsson, and Tómas Guðmundsson (Reykjavík: Helgafell, 1962), pp. 80–83. philosophicalÁrmann Jakobsson, 'Nietzsche í Grjótaþorpinu: siðferði manns og heims í Atómstöðinni', Andvari, 127 (2002), 127--42. http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?gegnirId=000503386. and political commentary: Giuliano D'Amico, for example, argues that 'neither with the Americans nor with the Soviets, the characters of Atómstöðin seem to advocate for a “Third Europe” that ... resembles the “third space” articulated by postcolonial theory'.Giuliano D’Amico, 'The Whole World Is One Atom Station: Laxness, the Cold War, Postcolonialism, and the Economic Crisis in Iceland', Scandinavian Studies, 87 (2015), 457-88 (p. 468), https://muse.jhu.edu/article/616175. Laxness endured political persecution for the novel: the Alþingi withdrew his state writer's stipend; he was prosecuted for describing an abortion; and 'Icelandic and American authorities even started investigating his periods of residence in America, with the hope of finding some fiscal irregularities and ruining him'. He also struggled to get the novel translated.Giuliano D’Amico, 'The Whole World Is One Atom Station: Laxness, the Cold War, Postcolonialism, and the Economic Crisis in Iceland', Scandinavian Studies, 87 (2015), 457-88 (p. 461), https://muse.jhu.edu/article/616175. ==Influence and adaptations== Atómstöðin has been characterised as 'what many readers and critics gradually came to think of as the exemplary Reykjavík novel', focusing on urban Icelandic life for the first time.Ástráður Eysteinsson and Úfhildur Dagsdóttir, 'Icelandic Prose Literature, 1940--1980', in A History of Icelandic Literature, ed. by Daisy Nejmann, History of Scandinavian literatures, 5 (University of Nebraska Press: 2007), pp. 404--70 (p. 411). . Laxness dubbed one of his characters, benjamín, an atómskáld ('atom-poet'), as a derogatory reference to modernist poets. The name came to be applied to a real group of poets, the Atom Poets.Eysteinn Þorvaldsson, 'Icelandic Poetry Since 1940', in A History of Icelandic Literature, ed. by Daisy Nejmann, History of Scandinavian literatures, 5 (University of Nebraska Press: 2007), pp. 471-- (p. 474). . The book was adapted as a film by Þorsteinn Jónsson in 1984.Atómstöðin (1984) - IMDb Through the film, the book has been seen to have continued resonances in twenty-first-century Iceland: 'the powerful imagery is coincidentally linked to the 2009 protests ... following the Icelandic banking crisis'.Helga Þórey Jónsdóttir, 'Atomic Station', in World Film Locations: Reykjavík, ed. by Jez Connolly and Caroline Whelan (Bristol: Intellect Books, 2012), pp. 14-15 (14). ==See also== * GIUK gap ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:1948 novels Category:Icelandic novels Category:Novels by Halldór Laxness Category:Novels set in Iceland Category:Icelandic-language novels Category:Icelandic books ","title":"The Atom Station"},{"id":"7824505","text":"Kolchugino () is a town and the administrative center of Kolchuginsky District in Vladimir Oblast, Russia, located on the Peksha River (Klyazma's tributary) some northwest of Vladimir, the administrative center of the oblast.

At the time of the Civil War, Van Camp was a well-known dentist in Washington, D.C.. After his arrest and imprisonment in the Old Capitol Prison, he was paroled in early 1862. During the remainder of the Civil War, he continued spying for the Confederacy. He had taken his family to California during the Gold Rush of 1849, and then traveled in the South Pacific. In the 1850s he operated a whaling supply company in Samoa, where he was appointed as Commercial Agent for the United States in the Navigator Islands (now American Samoa) from 1853 to 1856.

Formerly a wastebasket genus, many species historically placed here have been moved to other genera in the family, such as Amblyraja, Beringraja, Dipturus, Leucoraja and Rostroraja. Raja are flat-bodied, cartilaginous fish with a rhombic shapes due to their large pectoral fins extending from or nearly from the snouts to the bases of their tails. Their sharp snouts are produced by a cranial projection of rostral cartilage. The mouth and gills are located on underside of the body. They may be either solid-coloured or patterned, and most skates have spiny or thorn-like structures on the upper surface, and some species contain weak electrical organs within their tails. Mating typically occurs in the spring and the female lays numerous eggs per clutch which are encapsulated in leathery cases, commonly known as \\"mermaid’s purses\\". Species vary in size, ranging from about in length. These bottom-dwellers are active during both day and night, and typically feed on molluscs, crustaceans and fish. Raja skates are found in the East Atlantic, including the Mediterranean, and western Indian Ocean, ranging from relatively shallow water to a depth of .

He was born in London, Ontario. He is a two-time Olympian and was ranked 5th in the world (among welterweights) after the 2007 World Amateur Boxing Championships. ==2004 Summer Olympics== He represented his native country at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, where he was eliminated by technical knockout in the first round by Ruslan Khairov of Azerbaijan. Trupish qualified for the Athens Games as a lucky semifinal loser in the second tournament in Tijuana, Mexico. He took the place of Juan McPherson (USA), finalist from the 2003 Pan American Games. However his quota was dropped by the USA Boxing Association due to unsuccessful presentation at the USA Olympic trials. Winner of those trials Vanes Martirosyan qualified for the Qualifying Tournament in Tijuana. ==2008 Summer Olympics== Trupish was the only Canadian boxer (in any weight class) to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The CBC projected a first-bout loss and he was, in fact, eliminated after the first bout against Bakhyt Sarsekbayev of Kazakhstan by a points loss of 20-1. Afterward, Trupish was heavily criticised in the Canadian press for his poor performance--the Edmonton Sun said he was \\"absolutely annihilated\\"--but was also given credit for giving a wake-up call to Boxing Canada. The embarrassment of seeing their only fighter soundly defeated in the first round is expected to bring attention to the need for Canada to provide better funding and training to their athletes. ==References== ==External links== * Canadian Olympic Committee Category:1979 births Category:Boxers at the 1999 Pan American Games Category:Boxers at the 2003 Pan American Games Category:Boxers at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Boxers at the 2006 Commonwealth Games Category:Boxers at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Living people Category:Olympic boxers of Canada Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for Canada Category:Pan American Games competitors for Canada Category:Sportspeople from London, Ontario Category:Welterweight boxers Category:Canadian male boxers ","title":"Adam Trupish"},{"id":"7824623","text":"In Lingayat theology, the Ashtavaranas (ಅಷ್ಟಾವರಣ, ಎಂಬಗೆ, ಎಂಟು ಬಗೆ) refer to the eight virtues that act as shields or coverings protecting the devotee from extraneous distractions and influences of Maya. Ashta means 'eight' and Avarana means 'covering'. They also protect against attachment to worldly desires. The Ashtavaranas are described as, * Guru * Linga Ishta-Linga * Jangama * Vibhuti or Bhasma * Rudraksha * Padodaka * Prasada * Mantra Among the ashtavarnas, Guru, Linga and Jangama are the human beings to be worshiped. Guru means religious teacher at some stage his own conscious (arivu) can also become guru. Linga is considered to be the self (inner atma). and Lastly the Jangama is the human who wonders and propagates the teachings of dharma. Vibhuti, Mantra and Rudraksha are the things, by which one has to worship Guru, Linga and Jangama. Vibhuti is the indication of purity. It also means that the it is burnt ash of interest towards other woman, Gold and Land. Mantra is the holy chanting words. Normally Lingayats chant \\" OM SHRI GURUBASAVA LINGAYA NAMAH\\" and some chant \\" OM NAMAH SHIVAYA\\". Rudraksha is the thing one has to wear on the body. Rudraksha are available in punchamukhi and Ekmukhi Rudrakshas. In spiritually it is the symbol of third eye of \\"MAHADEVA\\" or \\"SHIVA\\". Here it can be interpreted as inner conscious, which plays as third eye. Lastly Padaodaka and Prasada are the outcomes of this worship. Padodaka is the liquid, and Prasad is food. Here spiritually one can interpret Padodaka as the knowledge outcome from Guru, Linga and Jangama's when they discuss daily concerns with their Anubhava (experience).

The goal of the skin is to sense important environmental parameters—such as proximity to objects, heat, moisture, and direct touch sensations. Examples of a sensitive skin have been made by a group at the University of Tokyo led by Prof. Takao Someya. The group's work has been published in Nature, Science and Advanced Materials journals, as well as Proceedings of the (United States) National Academy of Sciences. They have demonstrated pressure and temperature measurements at a resolution of a few millimeters, as well as organic transistors, organic solar cells, and organic light emitting diodes about 1 μm thick. The sensor arrays are based on many organic thin film transistors that are turned on one at a time and the current that flows through the sensor (electrical resistance-based) tells you how much pressure is being sensed. They have simultaneously measured pressure and temperature by using two separate arrays and laying one on top of another. ==See also== * Electronic nose * Electronic skin * Tactile sensor ==References== *Takao Someya Group at University of Tokyo Category:Robotic sensing Category:Medical equipment ","title":"Sensitive skin (electronic device)"},{"id":"7824718","text":"The Waid Academy is a public secondary school in Anstruther, Fife. The school's catchment area extends to as far as Elie and Colinsburgh to the west and Crail to the east (the East Neuk boundaries) but accepts pupils from towns such as Leven, Upper Largo, Lundin Links, Kennoway and Markinch. The Waid Academy school uniform consists of a black wool blazer, with red piping and a red and black tie, along with a school shirt and trousers/skirt, however any black jeans or other bottoms are accepted. ==History== Lieutenant Andrew Waid (1736–1804), an Anstruther man, left his money for the founding of Waid's Orphan Naval Academy for the sons of poor mariners and fishermen. For a variety of reasons it was not possible for his wishes to be carried out in the years following his death, and for much of the 19th century his will was ignored and the value of his estate accumulated. At last in 1884, Commissioners appointed under the Educational Endowments (Scotland) Act of 1882, proposed a scheme for his money to be used for the creation of a secondary school to serve the East Neuk of Fife. On 6 September 1886, The Waid Academy opened for the first time. It was the first school in Scotland to be created under the 1882 Act and its constitution became a model for other schools which were created or changed as a result of the Act. The old school campus was split between two buildings. The principal school building was previously the Head Masters house but latterly used for additional teaching rooms. South Waid was erected in 1901, this building sits to the north of Crail road and extended the number of classrooms, although it did result in students having to cross a small road in order to access them. The principal school building was extended in 1955 due to a rising influx of students. This extension consisted of a large two storey building which encompassed several new classrooms on both floors as well as two gymnasiums and a small swimming pool on the ground floor. In the following decades, several portable buildings and other small buildings were built surrounding both the principal building and South Waid. The Waid Academy received a coat of arms in 1959, approved by the Lord Lyon King of Arms. It was designed by Stewart Lees, teacher of art at the school from 1953 to 1960. The design and motto are based on the carving in stone above the school's main entrance. The coat of arms shows a ship passing between towers or pier heads. The logo is underscribed by the Latin phrase Multi Pertransibunt Et Augebitur Scientia – many will pass through and knowledge will be increased. The Waid Academy school uniform consists of a black wool blazer, with red piping and a red and black tie, along with a school shirt and trousers/skirt. A new sports hall and playing fields was opened for the school in 2003. In 2008, Iain Hughes was appointed Rector of the school, after serving as Deputy Rector for many years. In October 2014 funding was announced for a new £24 million building to be located on the existing school site, then planning consent issued in July 2015. The old school building was closed on 2 June 2017 with the main building been being put up for sale as well as the South Waid building. Most of the various extensions to the rear of the original school building were demolished to provide an all weather sports pitch and additional parking for the newly constructed school. The keys to the new build were handed over on 28 April 2017, with the school officially opening on 12 June 2017. ==Alumni== * Edith Bowman – Radio presenter * Doug Henderson – Labour MP for Newcastle North * John Lloyd – Journalist, chiefly for the Financial Times. * Andrew Mackintosh – Actor, portrayed DS Alistair Greig in the long-running ITV drama The Bill. * George Mudie – Labour MP for Leeds East * Daniel Sloss – Comedian * Catherine Steele – Plant biochemist ==References== ==External links== * *profile on Education Scotland ParentZone Category:Secondary schools in Fife Category:Educational institutions established in 1866 Category:1866 establishments in Scotland ","title":"Waid Academy"},{"id":"7824727","text":"Still in Love may refer to: * Still in Love (album), a 1982 album by Carrie Lucas * \\"Still in Love (Kissing You)\\", a Beyoncé Knowles cover version of the song \\"Kissing You\\" by Des'ree * \\"Still in Love\\", a song by 112 from Part III * \\"Still in Love\\" (Brian McKnight song), from the album I Remember You * \\"Still in Love\\", a song by Brooke Fraser from What to Do with Daylight * \\"Still in Love\\", a song by Corey Hart from Young Man Running * \\"Still in Love\\", a song by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds from Nocturama * \\"Still in Love\\", a song by David Gates, from the album Take Me Now * \\"Still in Love\\", a song by Lionel Richie from Louder Than Words * \\"Still in Love\\", a song by Diana Ross from Silk Electric * \\"Still in Love\\", a song by Supertramp from Brother Where You Bound * \\"Still in Love\\", a song by Tyra B * Still in Love (horse), a Japanese Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare ==See also== * Still in Love with You (disambiguation) * I'm Still in Love with You (disambiguation) ","title":"Still in Love"},{"id":"7824734","text":"\\"Hood Boy\\" is a song by American singer Fantasia featuring American rapper Big Boi, from her second and eponymous studio album (2006). It was released as the album's lead single by J Records on November 14, 2006. \\"Hood Boy\\" was written by Johnta Austin, Frank DeVol, Holland-Dozier-Holland, Anthony McIntyre and Antwan Patton, and produced by Austin and the Canadian production team Tone Mason. It samples the introduction of the Supremes' 1967 single, \\"The Happening\\". An uptempo R&B; song, \\"Hood Boy\\" explores Fantasia's appreciation for thugs. The song's reception was mostly positive; music critics praised its composition and Fantasia's vocals. The single appeared on several United States Billboard charts, peaking at number three on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. According to one commentator, the song was successful on urban radio. Its music video, directed by Norwegian photographer Ray Kay, was released on November 30, 2006. In the video, Fantasia sings and dances in a barbershop and in front of a neon sign and Big Boi performs his verses. To further promote \\"Hood Boy\\", Fantasia performed it at the 2011 Artscape festival and the 2018 Essence Music Festival. ==Background and release== American rapper Big Boi (pictured in 2012) co-wrote \\"Hood Boy\\" and contributes several verses. Due to the lukewarm commercial performance of – and mixed critical response to – Fantasia's 2004 debut pop album (Free Yourself), she and J Records decided to record more R&B; and hip hop for her second and eponymous album (2006). In her biography of Fantasia, Liz Sonneborn wrote that the singer \\"purposely cultivated a more daring sound\\" on her follow-up record.Sonneborn (2008): p. 39 Fantasia attributed the change in her musical style as an escape from her painful past, which was featured on the American reality competition series American Idol: \\"I'm not sad anymore; I'm not hurting anymore.

The song was released as an audio CD, which includes the radio edit and instrumental, and as a digital download. An 11-track remix extended play (EP), Dance Vault Mixes, was released on February 20, 2007 as a digital download. ==Composition and lyrics== \\"Hood Boy\\" is an uptempo three-minute, 34-second R&B; song. It samples the opening of the Supremes' 1967 song, \\"The Happening\\", and has verses by the American rapper Big Boi. The song's instrumentation includes an \\"opening salvo of horns\\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it a modern interpretation of Ike & Tina Turner's music, and AXS's Kareem Gantt described the track as \\"a buffet of neo-soul mixed in with hip-hop\\". Slant Magazine Sal Cinquemani cited the song as an example of the album's emphasis on production over vocals. \\"Hood Boys lyrics explore Fantasia's attraction to thugs, and Erlewine compared the song to Destiny's Child's 2004 single \\"Soldier\\". Curve's Margaret Coble saw it as a \\"radio-friendly thug ode\\". The track includes references to \\"wifebeaters and chains\\" and \\"some sexual innuendos and the 'N' word\\". ==Reception== Critical reaction to \\"Hood Boy\\" was positive, with Kareem Gantt including it on his list of top ten Fantasia songs. Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the singer's performance, writing that she \\"remakes herself into a vibrant, vital diva\\". A Stereogum writer called Fantasia's voice a \\"raspy, divalicious vox\\". Henry Goldblatt of Entertainment Weekly described \\"Hood Boy\\" as 2006's strongest R&B; release, and Michael Slezak called it \\"infectiously funky\\" and an \\"electrifying romp\\". Clover Hope of Billboard praised Fantasia's connection to the song, calling the tracks on more mature subjects \\"right up [the singer's] alley\\". However, Allison Steward of The Washington Post criticized \\"Hood Boy\\" as \\"credibility-shredding\\". The song appeared on several United States Billboard charts. It peaked at number three on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart on December 30, 2006, and remained on the chart for four weeks. The song reached number 67 on Hot 100 Airplay in January 2007, and stayed on the chart for four weeks. It peaked at number 21 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart on January 20, 2007, and remained on the chart for 19 weeks. The song also reached number 21 on the R&B;/Hip-Hop Airplay chart that day, remaining on that chart for 16 weeks. Jim Cantiello of MTV wrote that the single and its 2007 follow-up, \\"When I See U\\", were successful on urban radio. ==Music video and live performances== A music video for \\"Hood Boy\\", directed by Norwegian photographer Ray Kay, premiered on November 30, 2006 on BET. It was filmed in Crenshaw, Los Angeles; when describing the location, Fantasia said: \\"If you want to find a 'hood boy, you got to go to the 'hood to find one, and no better place to do it than Crenshaw.\\" In the video, Fantasia performs in front of a pink neon sign displaying her name; Michael Slezak compared the scene to Roxie Hart in the 1972 musical, Chicago. The singer also wears a short skirt, dancing in a barbershop and riding a motorcycle. Fantasia has a fauxhawk and large false eyelashes in some scenes, and Big Boi appears in others. The video ends with the police stopping a dance and Fantasia strutting away. Slezak praised the singer's confidence in the video. To further promote the single, Fantasia performed it at the 2011 Artscape festival to a positive audience response. She also sang it as part of the 2018 Essence Music Festival. \\"Hood Boy\\" was featured in an eleventh season episode of RuPaul's Drag Race as part of a lip-sync battle between Vanessa Vanjie Mateo and Plastique Tiara to determine who would be eliminated from the competition; the lip-sync resulted in Plastique Tiara being eliminated. ==Formats and track listings== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal. *Performer – Fantasia *Composer – Eddie Holland, Jr., Frank DeVol, Brian Holland, Anthony McIntyre, Antwan Patton, Johntá Austin, Lamont Dozier *Lyricist – Brian Holland, Johntá Austin, Frank DeVol, Eddie Holland, Jr., Lamont Dozier, Antwan Patton, Anthony McIntyre *Producer – Tone Mason, Johntá Austin *Mixing Engineer – Manny Marroquin *Recording Engineer – Aaron Fessel, Tatsuya Sato, Chris Caramouche ==Charts== { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:19em;\\"Chart (2006-07) !scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\"US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100  3 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Hot 100 Airplay (Billboard)  67 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard)  21 - !scope=\\"row\\"US R&B;/Hip-Hop Airplay (Billboard)  21 - } ==Release history== { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" - !

The bones are collected and used for traditional games and fortune-telling throughout Central Asia, and games involving the ankle bones may also be referred to by the name of the bones. They may be painted bright colours. Such bones have been used throughout history, and are thought to be the first forms of dice. In English language sources, shagai may be referred to as \\"ankle bones\\", and playing with shagai is sometimes called ankle bone shooting. Shagai games are especially popular during the Mongolian summer holiday of Naadam. In shagai dice, the rolled shagai generally land on one of four sides: horse, camel, sheep or goat. A fifth side, cow, is possible on uneven ground. Mongolians still exchange shagai today as tokens of friendship. The shagai may be kept in a little pouch. In addition, Mongolians (usually male) also collect wolf shagai (in this case the calcaneus rather than the astragalus), which are viewed as good-luck tokens, presumably due to the bone's superficial resemblance to the male genitalia. == Divination == In fortunetelling, four shagai are rolled on the ground; the two convex sides, horse and sheep, are considered lucky, with horse being the luckiest. The sides with concave indents, goat and camel, are deemed unlucky; rolling all four sides on one throw is considered indicative of very good fortune. == Games == Modernization of the shagai in Tyva by Kuzhuget Ali, Kyrgyz boys playing chükö-based game for fun in the stadium in Naryn, Kyrgyzstan. Monument at the site for the game in Osh, Kyrgyzstan. A large variety of traditional Mongolian games are played using the shagai pieces. Depending on the game, the anklebones may be tossed like dice, flicked like marbles, shot at with arrows, caught in the hands, or simply collected according to the roll of a die. In many games, the side on which a tossed piece lands (horse, sheep, camel, or goat) is significant. For one of the most popular games, there are even public tournaments held, most commonly played during the traditional Naadam festival. In this game, pieces are flicked with the middle finger of one hand, along a wooden board (khashlaga = fence rail) held in the other hand. The goal is to hit a target piece over a distance of about 10 m. An ankle bone shooting game was played under the name of at the 2014 World Nomad Games. Some other common games are: ; Horse race : A very common game, usually played with two, but also with more players. Each player flicks one piece (his \\"horse\\") in turn along a sequence of stationary pieces representing the race course. ; Birthing camels : On each turn, a player tosses all the pieces to the ground. The goal is then to use the \\"sheep\\" pieces to knock the \\"camel\\" pieces also into sheep position. ; Cat's game : A number of \\"sheep\\" (or \\"goats\\") are lined up two-by-two. The player then throws another object (often a piece of chain) up into the air and catches it again. In the short time while the object is floating, the task is to pick up one piece with the same hand, but not to disturb the others. ; Full toss : Each of two to four players in turn tosses all the pieces. Depending on the number of horses and/or camels landed, the player can collect pieces from the pool, or has to add some. Winner is the player who has collected the most once the pool is empty. ; Open catch : Using ten or more pieces, each player in turn places all of them in one hand and tosses them up into the air. Then he tries to catch as many as possible with the back of the same hand. The caught pieces are tossed up again, and as many as possible caught in a fist this time. The caught ones are collected by the player. Winner is who has collected the most pieces once the pool is empty. ; Twelve years : Two players in turn toss two pieces like dice for twelve rounds (corresponding to the twelve-year cycle of the traditional calendar), counting a point for each horse landed. If no player reaches 12 points, the game restarts, otherwise the higher score wins. ; Tossing three shagai : Any number of players take turns tossing three pieces like dice. Three pieces landing on the same side score two points, two sames give one point. Winner is who first reaches a predetermined number of points. ; The four shagai : Players take turns tossing four pieces. All four landing on different sides scores eight points, four sames give four points, and two pairs give two points. If a player manages to grab all pieces of a four sames throw (by any player), they also get the score of that throw. Winner is who first gets ahead of all others by a predetermined margin. ; Four animals : The pieces are divided into four groups, representing herds of different animals as of which side is turned upwards. Players take turns tossing one extra piece like a dice, collecting one from the herd of the type thrown, or putting one back if the respective herd is empty.

Lewis until 1963. The announcers for the show were, respectively, Johnny Olson, Wayne Howell and Roger Tuttle. In 2001, Play Your Hunch was ranked #43 on TV Guide's \\"50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time\\". Play Your Hunch was a Mark Goodson-Bill Todman production. It has been considered to be something of a \\"spin-off\\" of another more successful Goodson-Todman game, To Tell the Truth. It featured one of Robert Redford's first professional acting roles, with Ted Koppel also making an early career appearance. ==Broadcast history== The show first aired on CBS from 1958–1959. ABC picked it up in the same year, and then NBC aired it for the rest of its run, concluding in 1963. During the NBC run, two different prime time versions aired - one in 1960, and one in 1962. ==Hosts and announcers== The series was originally hosted by Merv Griffin. After he left on September 28, 1962 to begin his talk show. Gene Rayburn briefly took over from October 15 to November 16, 1962 before being reassigned to The Match Game. Robert Q. Lewis then took over for the rest of the run. Announcer Johnny Olson substituted for Griffin on December 29, 1961 and March 6, 1962. This was Olson's first regular announcing job with longtime employer Mark Goodson. ==Game play== Merv Griffin and Liz Gardner in 1960. Two couples (or occasionally pairs with other relationships) competed. The game revolved around \\"problems\\" which involved a choice between three visible possibilities (often three people) which were always labeled X, Y, and Z. Some questions would have an element of observation; for example, one couple was asked which of three labeled musicians amongst the show's band was not playing his instrument and was merely pretending. Other problems depended mainly on luck in guessing correctly. The teams were alternatively presented with problems and had the choice to play or pass after the choices were unveiled but before the problem was described. The couple who played the problem discussed the answer amongst themselves until a chime rang and the couple had to answer. If the couple was wrong, the opponents had the choice between the remaining two answers. If either couple got the right answer, they earned a point, with three points winning the game. In addition, each team earned $50 a point ($100 a point on NBC's primetime edition). At least once every show, the couples would also have to solve a \\"come-closer\\" problem, which involved coming up with a numerical answer to a problem by writing their answer on a slate (example: how many coffee beans in a displayed container); the teams would then reveal their slates, and the team who guessed closer to the actual answer would score a point. Couples remained on the show as champions until they were defeated, with the first question of each game going to the challengers. On the CBS version, the winning couple played an endgame known as \\"The Last Straw\\" for a car. The couple would be shown 7 straws, without knowing which 5 were long and which 2 were short. If the couple picked all 5 long straws, they won a car. If they picked a short straw, they earned $100 for each long straw they picked up to that point. A later bonus round would be played for a prize, like a trip, an appliance, a car, etc. Either the show's assistant Liz Gardner, or announcer Johnny Olson himself would hide behind one of three \\"doors\\" onstage; the couple would simply have to guess which \\"door\\" either of them was hiding behind. No bonus games were played on the NBC run. ==Foreign versions== A British version of the show was produced by the BBC in the early 1960s, hosted at one stage by Alan Freeman. An Australian version aired on QTQ Channel 9 in Brisbane from 1968 to 1973 hosted by Don Secombe. A different Australian version aired 1962-1964 on TCN-9 in Sydney, hosted by George Foster. ==Episode status== At least some episodes exist. GSN has aired a handful of episodes with Griffin as host in the past, most recently the nighttime premiere on August 20, 2007 (which had aired on GSN at least once prior). One public domain episode of the Griffin version is available on classic game show DVD collections. The year is unknown. On September 15, 2017, the network BUZZR played an episode of the show for their \\"Lost and Found\\" series of shows. No editions of the UK series are listed on the BBC Programme Catalogue, suggesting that no editions of the series survive in the archives. ==External links== *American version on IMDb *British version on IMDb *Sydney Australia version on IMDb ==References== Category:CBS original programming Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming Category:NBC original programming Category:Television series by Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions Category:1950s American game shows Category:1960s American game shows Category:BBC television game shows Category:1960s British game shows Category:1958 American television series debuts Category:1963 American television series endings Category:1962 Australian television series debuts Category:1964 Australian television series endings Category:1960s Australian game shows Category:1970s Australian game shows Category:Black-and-white Australian television shows Category:English-language television shows ","title":"Play Your Hunch"},{"id":"7824827","text":"The Official Finnish Charts (, ) are national record charts in Finland compiled and published by Musiikkituottajat - IFPI Finland.

In January 1991, the Yle radio station Radiomafia started to compile the first weekly chart in Finland called Radiomafian lista, which was broadcast on the radio every Sunday. Prior to that, all singles and album charts in Finland had been either monthly or biweekly published sales charts. Radiomafian lista became the official Finnish charts in January 1994 when they began a partnership with Suomen Ääni- ja kuvatallennetuottajat (ÄKT) (now known as Musiikkituottajat – IFPI Finland), the umbrella organization of recording producers active in Finland. Simultaneously, they began to publish the first weekly published singles chart based on sales in Finland, as well as a chart for studio and compilation albums. This move effectively killed the competition from the other chart compilers and by 1995, the Official Finnish Charts were the only sales charts published in Finland. == Charts == Presently the following weekly charts are composed and published by Musiikkituottajat, according to sales and streaming: Note: Click to open the PDF file \\"Suomen Virallisen Listan säännöt\\" on the right side of the page. *Albums (Top 50) (Suomen virallinen albumilista, the Official Finnish Albums Chart) *Singles (Top 20) (Suomen virallinen singlelista, the Official Finnish Singles Chart) *Mid-priced albums (Top 10) *Music DVDs (Top 10) In addition, Musiikkituottajat owns and publishes a digital chart which tracks digital sales of songs and is compiled by the Official Charts Company.

The endpapers or end-papers of a book (also known as endsheets) are the pages that consist of a double-size sheet folded, with one half pasted against an inside cover (the pastedown), and the other serving as the first free page (the free endpaper or flyleaf). Thus, the front endpapers precede the title page and the text, whereas the back endpapers follow the text. Booksellers sometimes refer to the front endpaper as FEP. Before mass printing in the 20th century it was common for the endpapers of books to have paper marbling. Sometimes the endpapers are used for maps or other relevant information. They are the traditional place to put bookplates, or an owner's inscription. , there are many styles of endsheets or endpapers that are specifically designed for use with different bindings. For example, endsheets reinforced with cloth are used in sewn bindings. The cloth holds the stitches and prevents the paper from perforating and tearing. Other styles are designed for use with perfect binders. Combined and Universal Endsheets are loaded into the cover feeder of an automatic perfect binder and attached – instead of the soft cover – automatically producing a book block reinforced from head to tail. The Folded Tabbed End sheet is collated with the text pages, milled and bound along with the book block.

A resident of St. Catharines, Ontario, he represented his native country at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. He was involved in one of the many controversies that engulfed the Olympic boxing tournament. In Pagendam's opening bout versus Tserendorj Amarjargal of Mongolia, Ivorian referee Joseph Lougbo gave Tserendorj a standing-8 count in the second round. Pagendam was subsequently knocked down once in the second round, then climbed off the floor and soon knocked down Tserendorj. After that, the referee gave another standing-8 count against the Mongolian, which should have terminated the bout, according to international rules. In the third round, however, Pagendam was rocked by a punch to the head, and Lougbo stopped the bout, awarding the Mongolian the win. Afterwards, Canada protested, contending that Pagendam had actually won the bout in the second round. The protest was upheld, and AIBA announced that the referee was suspended from the rest of the Games' boxing tournament. Later however, the Canadians were informed that although Pagendam was the winner of the bout, he could not continue in the tournament for medical reasons. According to AIBA rules, fighters whose bouts are stopped because of head blows may not fight again for 60 days.

The group of approximately 400 service members and civilians worked with military forces to safeguard historic and cultural monuments from war damage, and as the conflict came to a close, to find and return works of art and other items of cultural importance that had been stolen by the Nazis or hidden for safekeeping. Many of the men and women of the MFAA, also known as \\"Monuments Men\\", went on to have prolific careers. Largely art historians and museum personnel, many of the American members of the group had formative roles in the growth of the United States’ greatest cultural institutions, including the National Gallery of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the New York City Ballet. Members from other allied powers, such as the United Kingdom and France, also found post-war success in museums and other institutions across the world. The legacy of the men and women who served in the MFAA lives on through the creation of the Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art, a US non-profit founded by American author and philanthropist Robert M. Edsel. The Foundation seeks to further the mission of the MFAA by recovering Nazi looted artworks, documents, and other cultural objects and returning them to their rightful owners. Monuments men and women have worked directly with the Foundation, including Harry L. Ettlinger and Motoko Fujishiro Huthwaite. == Formation == Even before the U.S. entered World War II, art professionals and organizations such as the American Defense Harvard Group and the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) were working to identify and protect European art and monuments in harm’s way or in danger of Nazi plundering. The groups sought a national organization affiliated with the military which would have the same goal. Francis Henry Taylor, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, took their concerns to Washington, D.C. Their efforts ultimately led to the establishment by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the \\"American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas\\" on June 23, 1943. What began as a brain trust of the art world’s finest during the war became a group of 345 men and women from 13 countries that comprised the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section unit. They spent 1945 seeking out more than 1,000 troves containing an estimated 5 million pieces of artwork and cultural items stolen from wealthy Jews, museums, universities, and religious institutions. And for six years after the surrender, a smaller group of about 60 Monuments Men continued scouring Europe as art detectives. Commonly referred to as the Roberts Commission after its chairman, Supreme Court Justice Owen J. Roberts, the group was charged with promoting the preservation of cultural properties in war areas, including the European, Mediterranean, and Far Eastern Theaters of Operations, providing that this mission did not interfere with military operations. Headquartered at the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., the Commission drew up lists of and reports on European cultural treasures and provided them to military units, in hopes that these monuments would be protected whenever possible. The Commission helped establish the MFAA branch within the Civil Affairs and Military Government Sections of the Allied armies, led by Major L. Bancel LaFarge. After the war, the Roberts Commission helped the MFAA and Allied Forces return Nazi-confiscated artworks to rightful owners. It also promoted public awareness of looted cultural works. The group was dissolved in June 1946, when the State Department took over its duties and functions. General Dwight D. Eisenhower facilitated the work of the MFAA by forbidding looting, destruction, and billeting in structures of cultural significance. He also repeatedly ordered his forces to assist the MFAA as much as possible. This was the first time in history an army attempted to fight a war and at the same time reduce damage to cultural monuments and property. == War operations == As Allied Forces made their way through Europe, liberating Nazi-occupied territories, Monuments Men were present in very small numbers at the front lines. Lacking handbooks, resources, or supervision, this initial handful of officers relied on their museum training and overall resourcefulness to perform their tasks. There was no established precedent for what they confronted. They worked in the field under the Operations Branch of SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, Europe, commanded by Eisenhower), and were actively involved in battle preparations. In preparing to take Florence, which was used by the Nazis as a supply distribution center due to its central location in Italy, Allied troops relied on aerial photographs provided by the MFAA which were marked with monuments of cultural importance so that pilots could avoid damaging such sites during bombings. When damage to monuments did occur, MFAA personnel worked to assess damage and buy time for the eventual restoration work that would follow. Monuments officer Deane Keller had a prominent role in saving the Campo Santo in Pisa after a mortar round started a fire that melted the lead roof, which then bled down the iconic 14th century fresco-covered walls. Keller led a team of Italian and American troops and restorers in recovering the remaining fragments of the frescoes and in building a temporary roof to protect the structure from further damage. Restoration of the frescoes continues even today. Countless other monuments, churches, and works of art were saved or protected by the dedicated personnel of the MFAA section. Frequently entering liberated towns and cities ahead of ground troops, Monuments Men worked quickly to assess damage and make temporary repairs before moving on with Allied Armies as they conquered Nazi territory. Two monuments officers were killed in Europe, both near the front lines of the Allied advance into Germany. Captain Walter Huchthausen, an American scholar and architect attached to the U.S. 9th Army, was killed in April 1945 by small arms fire somewhere north of Essen and east of Aachen, Germany. Major Ronald Edmond Balfour, a British scholar attached to the Canadian First Army, was killed in March 1945 by an explosion in Cleves, Germany. Edsel, (2009), pp. 242-5. == Art repositories == American and allied forces in Europe discovered hidden caches of priceless treasures. Many were the product of looting by Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. Others had been legitimately evacuated from museums for safekeeping. Monuments Men oversaw the safeguarding, cataloguing, removal and packing of all works from all these repositories. In Italy, museum officials had sent their holdings to various countryside locations such as the Tuscan villa of Montegufoni, which housed some of the Florentine collections. As Allied forces advanced through Italy, the German army retreated north, stealing paintings and sculptures from these repositories as they fled. As German forces neared the Austrian border, they were forced to store most of their loot in various hiding places, such as a castle at Sand in Taufers and a jail cell in San Leonardo. Beginning in late March 1945, Allied forces began discovering these hidden repositories in what would become the \\"greatest treasure hunt in history\\". In Germany alone, U.S. forces found about 1,500 repositories of art and cultural objects looted from institutions and individuals across Europe, as well as German and Austrian museum collections that had been evacuated for safekeeping. Soviet forces also made discoveries, such as treasures from the extraordinary Dresden Transport Museum. Hundreds of the artifacts were surrendered by, or had their locations reported by, SS General Karl Wolff as part of Operation Sunrise, his secret negotiation with the Office of Strategic Services. These included the contents of the Uffizi and Pitti palaces and paintings by Titian and Botticelli. Some of the repositories discovered by Monuments Men in Germany, Austria, and Italy were: *Berchtesgaden, Germany: The 101st Airborne Division, known as the \\"Screaming Eagles\\", found more than 1,000 paintings and sculptures stolen by German Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring. The cache had been transferred from his country estate, Carinhall, and moved to Berchtesgaden in April 1945. *Bernterode, Germany: Americans found four coffins containing the remains of Germany’s greatest leaders, including those of Frederick the Great (Frederick II of Prussia) and field marshal Paul Von Hindenburg. Also found in the mine were 271 paintings, including court portraits from the Prussian Sanssouci palace in Potsdam, Germany, which had been hidden behind a locked door and a brick wall nearly five feet thick. The site was originally used as an ammunition and military supply complex manned by hundreds of slave laborers. *Merkers, Germany: The Kaiserode mine at Merkers was discovered by the U.S. 3rd Army under General George S. Patton in April 1945. Reichsbank gold, along with 400 paintings from the Berlin museums and numerous other crates of treasures were also discovered. More dismal discoveries included gold and personal belongings from Nazi concentration camp victims. *Neuschwanstein Castle, Germany: Over 6,000 items stolen by the ERR (Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg, Alfred Rosenberg’s task force that handled the \\"legalized\\" looting of Jews) from private collectors in France were found here, including furniture, jewelry (see Nazi gold), paintings and other belongings. Monuments Man Capt. James Rorimer oversaw the evacuation of the repository, which also held ERR documents. *Altaussee, Austria: This extensive complex of salt mines served as a huge repository for art stolen by the Nazis, but it also contained holdings from Austrian collections. More than 6,500 paintings alone were discovered at Altaussee. The contents included: Belgian-owned treasures such as Michelangelo’s Madonna of Bruges stolen from the Church of Our Lady in Bruges, and Jan van Eyck’s Ghent Altarpiece stolen from Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent; Vermeer’s The Astronomer and The Art of Painting which were to be focal points of Hitler’s Führermuseum in Linz, Austria; and paintings from the Capodimonte Museum in Naples, Italy that had been stolen by the Hermann Göring Tank Division (Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann Göring) at Monte Cassino in Italy. *San Leonardo, Italy: In the jail cell of this far northern town, Allied officials discovered paintings from the Uffizi that had been hurriedly unloaded by retreating German troops. Among the masterpieces were paintings by Sandro Botticelli, Filippo Lippi and Giovanni Bellini. == Restitutions == In early May 1945, Lt. Col. Geoffrey Webb, British MFAA chief at Eisenhower’s headquarters, proposed that U.S. forces quickly prepare buildings in Germany so that they might receive large shipments of artworks and other cultural property found in the numerous repositories. Eisenhower directed his subordinates to immediately begin preparing such buildings, ordering that art objects were to be handled only by MFAA personnel. Suitable locations with little damage and adequate storage space were difficult to find. By July 1945, U.S. forces had established two central collecting points within the U.S. Zone in Germany: Munich and Wiesbaden. Secondary collecting points were also established in various German towns, including: Bad Wildungen, Heilbronn, Marburg, Nuremberg, and Oberammergau. One of the more critical of these secondary collecting points was at Offenbach, where officials processed millions of Nazi-looted books, archives, manuscripts, Jewish objects such as Torah scrolls, and property seized from Masonic lodges. In summer 1945, Capt. Walter Farmer became the collecting point's first director. The first shipment of artworks arriving at Wiesbaden. When his superiors ordered that he send to the U.S. 202 German-owned paintings in his custody, Farmer and 35 others who were in charge of the Wiesbaden collection point gathered to draw up what has become known as the Wiesbaden manifesto on 7 November 1945, declaring \\"We wish to state that, from our own knowledge, no historical grievance will rankle so long or be the cause of so much justified bitterness as the removal for any reason of a part of the heritage of any nation even if that heritage may be interpreted as a prize of war.\\" Among the co-signers was Lt. Charles Percy Parkhurst of the U.S. Navy. Once an object arrived at a collecting point, it was recorded, photographed, studied, and sometimes conserved so that it could be returned to its country of origin as soon as possible. Some objects were easily identifiable and could be quickly returned, such as the Veit Stoss Altar of Veit Stoss from St. Mary's Basilica in Kraków, which had been discovered in the Nuremberg Castle. Others, such as unmarked paintings or library collections, were much more difficult to process. Among the facilities were: *Munich Central Collecting Point (MCP): Monuments officer Lt. Craig Hugh Smyth established the MCP in July 1945. He converted the former Führerbau, which housed Hitler’s office, into a functional art depot complete with photography studios and conservation labs. This facility primarily housed art stolen by the ERR from private collections and Hitler’s collection found at Altaussee. *Wiesbaden Collecting Point (WCP): Monuments officer Capt. Walter Farmer helped establish this facility in July 1945. Art from the Berlin museums and other items found in the mines at Merkers were processed here. Museum collections stored at Siegen and Grasleben also were sent to Wiesbaden. *Offenbach Collecting Point (OCP), also known as the Offenbach Archival Depot: Established in July 1945 in the I.G. Farben building on the Main River just outside Frankfurt, Offenbach primarily served as an archival depot. Because the OCP housed the largest collection of Jewish cultural property in the world, including the entire holdings of the Rothschild Library in Frankfurt and cultural objects from Masonic lodges, restitutions were complicated. Identification of the millions of books, religious objects and other materials was tedious. Many of the owners had become victims of the Holocaust leaving no one alive to pursue claims. The facility was closed in 1948 and its remaining unclaimed items were transferred to Wiesbaden. ==Occupation of Japan== As the war neared its end in Japan in 1945, Monuments Men George Stout and Major Laurence Sickman recommended creating an MFAA division there. Consequently, the Arts and Monuments Division of the Civil Information and Education Section of GHQ of the Supreme Command of the Allied Powers in Tokyo was established. Stout was the Chief of the Division from about August 1945 until the middle of 1946. Langdon Warner, archaeologist and curator of Oriental art at Harvard’s Fogg Museum, advised the MFAA Section in Japan from April to September 1946. Other members included Howard Hollis, Lt. Col. Harold Gould Henderson, Lt. Sherman Lee, and Lt. Patrick Lennox Tierney. ==MFAA personnel== The American museum establishment led the efforts to create the MFAA section. Its members included museum directors, curators, and art historians, as well as those who aspired to join their ranks. Many major museums employed one or more MFAA officers before or after the war, including the National Gallery of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Toledo Museum of Art, and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. Many other Monuments Men were or became professors at esteemed universities such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, New York University, Williams College, and Columbia University, among others. Paul J. Sachs’ famous \\"Museum Course\\" at Harvard had educated dozens of future museum personnel in the decades preceding World War II. S. Lane Faison's passion for art history was passed on to hundreds of students and future museum leaders at Williams College in the 1960s and 1970s, some of whom are currently directors at major United States museums. Upon returning home from service overseas, many former MFAA personnel led the creation or improvement of some of the leading cultural institutions in the United States. MFAA personnel became founders, presidents, and members of cultural institutions such as the New York City Ballet, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, the American Association of Museums, the American Association of Museum Directors, the Archaeological Institute of America, the Society of Architectural Historians, the American Society of Landscape Architects, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the National Endowment for the Arts, as well as respected artists, architects, musicians, and archivists. ==Awards== Surviving members receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor in 2015 * 2007 National Humanities Medal, was awarded to the Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art on behalf of the USA. * 2009 honorary Doctor of Fine Arts, by MassArt * On May 19, 2014, the United States House of Representatives voted to pass the Monuments Men Recognition Act of 2013, a bill that would award the Monuments Men a Congressional Gold Medal \\"in recognition of their heroic role in the preservation, protection, and restitution of monuments, works of art, and artifacts of cultural importance during and following\\" World War II. Representatives praised the Monuments Men for preserving cultural heritage. The award was given after several years of tireless work on the part of the Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art, and its founder Robert M. Edsel. ==2014 film== The Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program is the subject of the 2014 Sony Pictures and 20th Century Fox film The Monuments Men. The critically acclaimed film, which stars George Clooney, Matt Damon, Jean Dujardin and Cate Blanchett, is based on Robert M. Edsel's NYT's best-selling book Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History. == See also == * Roberts Commission * List of Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (MFAA) personnel * Counterintelligence Corps * Art repatriation * Art theft and looting during World War II * Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art * Rescuing Da Vinci * The Rape of Europa * Wiesbaden manifesto ==References== Notes Bibliography * Paolucci, Stefano.

The Nintendo versions of the game were released by Bandai, while the Sega versions were published by Sega themselves. The Green Ranger is only playable on the Genesis and Game Gear versions of the game. ==Super NES== The first level in the Super NES version of the game showing the roster of Rangers and Jason fighting a Putty Patroler The Super NES version of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is a side- scrolling action game composed of seven stages, with two different gameplay styles. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Super NES game a score of 6.5 out of 10 but a unanimously negative assessment, saying it has poor animation and dull level design and \\"is simply way too easy for experienced players.\\" They praised the character selection feature, but concluded that even Power Ranger fans would find the game entertaining for only a short while. Nintendo Magazine System gave the game an overall score of 77, describing the difficulty as \\"mighty tough\\". Praise was given to the energetic presentation and style akin to the TV show, fluid controls and animation, and the attention to detail in making each character unique with trademark moves. One of the reviewers gave Bandai credit for \\"a genuine attempt at something vaguely special\\", calling the end result \\"pretty cool\\", while the other reviewer dubbed the game unoriginal. Other criticism was directed at the old-fashioned gameplay and repetitive feel, with the final consensus being that the game was more for hardcore fans than hardcore gamers. ==Game Boy== The Game Boy version is a side-scrolling action game similar to the SNES game but much more simplified. There are five levels, each consisting of two segments. In the ranger segment, any of the five original rangers must go through a level while defeating putty patrols. Using the select button unlocks their unique weapon, but drains health with each use. The second segment is a Megazord fight versus the main villains of the show. When played on the Super Game Boy, unique color palettes can be used with each ranger. ==Genesis== The Sega Genesis/Mega Drive version is a one-on-one competitive fighting game, featuring two different game modes: a Scenario Mode where the player competes against a series of CPU-controlled opponents, and a Battle Mode for two players. In the Scenario Mode, the matches consist of two segments: the player will fight against a regular-sized monster as one of the Rangers, and after the defeating the monster they will battle a giant version of it. Initially, only the five original Rangers and the Megazord are available, but once the Green Ranger is defeated, he and the Dragonzord are unlocked. GamePro panned the game, chiefly for the one-dimensional gameplay and unbalanced difficulty. ==Game Gear== In this version, the player has three basic attacks (one of which is accomplished by pressing the two action buttons simultaneously), a throw, and three special moves per character. The Game Gear version has more levels and enemies than the Genesis version. The game consists of three game modes: a single-player story game which features a series of plot-based battles against an assortment of enemies, a single-player vs. game, and a two-player Link game in which two players battle each other using the link cable. Like the Genesis version, the Green Ranger and Dragonzord (Including Dragonzord Battle Mode) become unlocked once they are defeated in the story mode. GamePro described the game as \\"a satisfying blend of fighting and adventure, perfect for beginning players.\\" They commented that the game's story mode is simplistic and very easy, but enjoyable, and is enhanced by the ability to control any of the Power Rangers in the game's other modes. Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the large number of moves and the ability to play as the Megazord, and scored the game a 6.2 out of 10. ==Sega CD== The Sega CD version is a full motion video-based quick time event game. ==See also== *Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie (video game) *Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Fighting Edition ==References== ==External links== *power rangers samurai fan game website *Game Boy, Game Gear, Genesis, and SNES versions at MobyGames Category:1994 video games Category:Bandai games Category:Beat 'em ups Category:Game Boy games Category:Game Boy-only games Category:Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Category:Natsume (company) games Category:Power Rangers video games Category:Sega CD games Category:Sega Game Gear games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Side-scrolling beat 'em ups Category:Superhero video games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Versus fighting games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Iku Mizutani Category:Video games scored by Kinuyo Yamashita Category:Video games featuring female antagonists Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games set in 1994 ","title":"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (video game)"},{"id":"7825175","text":"Helsingborg City Theatre (in Swedish: Helsingborgs stadsteater) is the city theatre of Helsingborg, Sweden. Helsingborg City Theatre The present Helsingborg City Theatre was built in 1921, after the old Helsingborg Theatre (located at the same place, built in 1877) was demolished. The building was designed by the local architectural firm Arkitektfirman Arton. But even before that the location harboured a small theatre house dating back to 1821. Being a well-placed geographical link between Sweden and Denmark, Helsingborg has a proud and steady theatre tradition, particularly from European guest touring theatre companies. The theatre's productions became famous through the management of director Ingmar Bergman, who managed Helsingborg City Theatre in the years 1944-46. In 2010, Ingmar Bergman square was named after him to honour his contributions to the city's theater-culture. The theater underwent several major reorganizations during the 2000s and since 1 January 2015 has been part of the municipal company Helsingborg Arena & Scen AB. ==References== ==External links== * Helsingborg City Theater (official site) City Theatre Category:Theatres in Sweden Category:Buildings and structures in Skåne County Category:Tourist attractions in Skåne County ","title":"Helsingborg City Theatre"},{"id":"7825232","text":"Schwadorf is an Austrian market town in the Bruck an der Leitha district.

He lived in San Diego during the earliest years of his childhood. He has three sisters. One of his sisters is also a painter, and two of his sisters are completely deaf. His Northern New Mexican ancestry can be traced back eleven generations. His father is a mathematician and computer scientist who has worked on many weapons projects at laboratories including White Sands Missile Range and Los Alamos National Laboratory. Roybal studied fine art at The Colorado Institute of Art. He apprenticed with French artist Jean-Claude Gaugy and lived and studied with Austrian artist Ernst Fuchs. His debut show was in Payerbach, Austria in 2000. ==Paintings== Judas, egg tempera and oil on wood, 10x 8 Roybal’s work is inspired by Northern Renaissance Art and early Mannerism. His influences are numerous, including Jan van Eyck, El Greco, and Hieronymus Bosch. Contemporary influences include Ernst Fuchs, Remedios Varo, and Mark Ryden. Roybal’s painting technique is modeled after Jan van Eyck and his followers. His work has gained greater prominence beginning in 2002 with the distinguished honor of being named one of the top 100 contemporary Hispanic artists by The National Hispanic Cultural Center. In 2006, he participated in a group show titled “Life and Liberty After 9-11” at The Las Cruces Museum of Art. Stylistically his work mixes religion, metaphysics, modern symbols such as toys and televisions with elongated stylized figures. His subject matter is influenced by Carl Jung’s work on archetypes and esoteric traditions including alchemy and metaphysics. He recently had a major show at The Albuquerque Museum of Art and also began showing at La Luz de Jesus Gallery on Hollywood Blvd. in Los Angeles, California. ==Personal life== Roybal currently lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico. ==Album Art== * \\"Mystical Sun\\" Energy Mind Consciousness, released by Cyberset Music. * \\"Wintergreen\\" Around and Around Again. ==Publications== * \\"Ashe Journal\\" 2010 * \\"The Alibi\\" 2010 * \\"Ashe Journal\\" Special Art Issue, 2007. * The American Artists BlueBook” (2004, 2005, 2006) * “Dawnings” (2001) * “The Santa Fe Reporter” 2003 * “The Essential Guide” 2003 ===Solo Exhibitions=== *2001 \\"Atomic Bombs and Religious Icons\\", Rancho de Chimayo Gallery, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. *2002 \\"Conquering Surrealism in America”, Rancho de Chimayo Gallery. *2003 “Recognitions and Precognitions”, Sacred Arts Gallery, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. *2004 \\"Narrative Enigmas\\", The Journey Fine Arts Gallery, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. *2006 \\"Spanish Market Celebration\\", Rancho de Chimayo Gallery. *2007 \\"Spanish Market Celebration\\", Rancho de Chimayo Gallery. *2008 \\"Spanish Market Celebration\\", Rancho de Chimayo Gallery. *2009\\"Spanish Market Celebration\\", Rancho de Chimayo Gallery. ==Collections== *The National Hispanic Cultural Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA. *Ernst Fuchs collection, Vienna, Austria. ==See also== * Visionary art ==References== * http://alibi.com/index.php?story=30544&scn;=art * https://web.archive.org/web/20121107024038/https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/around- around-again/id283959064 (Wintergreen album) * http://www.MysticalSun.com * http://www.askart.com/askart/r/antonio_roybal/antonio_roybal.aspx (Artist Bluebook for American Artists) * http://www.ashejournal.com/index.php?id=295 (Spiritual Magazine) ==External links== * http://www.AntonioRoybal.com/ - Antonio Roybal’s Official Website * http://www.KlaudiaMarrgallery.com (Gallery that represents Antonio Roybal's work.) * http://www.beinart.org * https://web.archive.org/web/20110202102246/http://ranchochimayo.com/ -Santa Fe Gallery representing Roybal. * http://www.all- art.org/art_20th_century/roybal1.html -History of Art website including a section with Roybal's work. * http://www.askart.com/askart/artist.aspx?artist=133621 * http://nhccnm.org/ -The National Hispanic Cultural Center has a work by Roybal in its permanent collection. * Antonio Roybal on GodConsciousness.com * http://www.ashejournal.com/index.php?id=295 Roybal's work featured in Ashé Journal * http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/glossary/Painters-by- Nationality.html Painters of the World by Nationality.

Wood End is surrounded by the districts of Bell Green, Alderman's Green, Potters Green and Henley Green. To the south of Wood End is the Manor Farm estate, which along with Henley Green and Deedmore, make up the four areas marked for redevelopment in the New Deal for Communities programme. Along with Walsgrave and Potters Green, these six areas make up the Henley ward. Wood End was built by the city council in the late 1950s and early 1960s, to rehouse families from inner city slum clearances as well as people moving into the city to work in the city's then-booming car industry. However, by the 1980s, Wood End was soon recognised as one of the worst districts of Coventry, with some of the city's highest levels of crime and unemployment. £34million was invested on improving the estate between 1987 and 2002, with many homes being refurbished and some being demolished, as well as new community projects being launched, but crime rates remained high and Wood End was unable to shake off its unwanted reputation. Many of the homes are now owned by the Whitefriars Housing Group, a housing trust which took over the running and management of Coventry's council houses in 2000. In April 2004, it was announced that Wood End, along with three other neighbouring districts, was to be extensively redeveloped. The outline plans stated that a large percentage of the estate's homes would be demolished and replaced with new homes to which existing tenants would be entitled to live. It was reported on the 6 July 2006 Coventry Evening Telegraph that the Severn Trent water company had revealed that the Wood End area is inaccessible without a police escort, even for emergencies, due to earlier attacks on employees. It was also revealed that Wood End is the only estate in the region which has a danger warning; there has been civil unrest on several occasions. On 12 May 1992, a wave of rioting which persisted for several days began in Wood End. Gangs of youths hurled petrol bombs at riot police after a crackdown on local youths using scrambler bikes. Passing vehicles were stoned, and nearby Wyken Infants School was badly damaged in an arson attack. The following night, 16 people were arrested after police were targeted with bricks and petrol bombs in a disturbance outside the Live and Live public house. The rioting then spread to the Willenhall district in the south of the city. The third night of disturbances in Wood End saw rioters rip metal shutters from the frontage of a newsagents. On the fourth night, the rioters turned their attention to firefighters, who found themselves being stoned by a gangs of youths, while further disturbances in the Willenhall district saw police being targeted by missiles thrown from upstairs windows and balconies of flats. The rioting ceased on 17 May. Newly-elected local Labour MP Bob Ainsworth condemned the violence, but was keen to highlight that it was almost inevitable due to the lack of opportunities available in the area, particularly unemployment which stood at around 25% locally, as well as family breakdown, poverty and child neglect.

He was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the seventh round of the 2008 NFL Draft. He played college football at Southern California. ==Early years== Washington had a heralded career as an athlete at South Torrance High School. In his Senior 2002 season, he earned numerous All-American honors, running for 1,549 yards on 140 carries (11.1 avg.) with 23 TDs while catching 13 passes for 200 yards (15.4 avg.) with 2 TDs in 2002 despite missing 5 games with a knee injury. He also earned substantial notice as a sophomore and junior player As a Senior, Washington was ranked as the #12 running back in the nation by ESPN.com was aggressively recruited by USC and Michigan State, as well as Wisconsin, Oregon, Oregon State, ASU, Arizona, Boston College and Washington State. ==College career== Although Washington admitted he grew up as a rival-UCLA fan, he became USC's second commitment to the 2003 recruiting class in May 2002. That class also included two other highly touted running backs: 2005 Heisman Trophy-winner Reggie Bush as well as Colorado high school all-star and future USC touchdown leader LenDale White. Going into their freshman 2003 season, all three backs were considered to be talented enough to challenge for the starting position and all three played during the USC opener at Auburn. Washington's freshman season was limited by a nagging ankle injury suffered in the second game of the season that caused him to miss half the season and the 2004 spring practice due to a stress fracture in the ankle. He was ruled academically ineligible for the 2004 season and was redshirted. Washington was again academically ineligible for the 2005 season and lost his athletic scholarship. After considering entering the NFL Draft, leaving USC or transferring to a different school (with easier academic requirements), Washington was encouraged by his parents, teammates and university staff to stay in school and focus on academics while paying his own way through school. After much focus and hard work, Washington finally regained academic eligibility in the spring of 2006, and regained his scholarship that August.Washington (#23) as the Trojans running back against the Stanford Cardinal. Initially planned as the starting running back for the 2006 USC Trojans, the redshirt junior suffered a hamstring injury in pre-season practice, but had re-gained the starting position by midseason. He told the Los Angeles Times' Gary Klein that he had decided to forego the 2007 NFL Draft and return for his redshirt senior season.

In Manila 1992, at second reserve board (+0 −0 =2), and in Istanbul 2000, at third board (+5 −4 =4). He was awarded the International Master (IM) title in 1976, and the Grandmaster (GM) title in 1997, following his win in the World Senior Championship. This achievement is notable in that he was one of the oldest players to be awarded the GM title for current achievements, rather than an honorary or retrospective title. This can be explained by the fact that although he was a strong master for many years, he was rarely allowed to play outside of the Soviet Union, and therefore had few opportunities to gain FIDE titles. Likely his career as a Soviet Army officer hampered his international chess opportunities. In 2001 he earned the International Correspondence Chess GM title.ICCF player profile Jānis Klovāns won the World Senior Chess Championship in 1997, 1999, and 2001.

Born in Roby, Lancashire, England, he began his ministry in the Filey circuit. He was ordained as a Methodist minister in 1928 and served circuits in the north and south of England until 1969. During his career as a minister he wrote numerous plays and hymns. It was not until he retired, however, that he began writing prolifically. His hymns reflect his rejection of fundamentalism and show his concern with social issues. They include many that were written to supply obvious liturgical needs of the modern church, speaking to topics or appropriate for events for which there were few traditional hymns available. Green also wrote poetry: his poem The Old Couple was included by Philip Larkin in 'The Oxford Book of Twentieth- Century English Verse' (1973). He died on 22 October 2000. His obituary in The Times of 24 October 2000 quoted him as saying of hymn singing, \\"It’s such a dangerous activity … you get this glow which you can mistake for religious experience\\".Quoted by Royden, C., Great Hymn Writers: Fred Pratt Green, accessed 24 August 2016 His hymns appear in hymn books of various denominations, but most notably in Singing the Faith, the hymn book of the Methodist Church of Great Britain, and the United Methodist Hymnal used in the United States. Hymnal indexes vary in alphabetizing him under 'G' or 'P'. As well as writing his own hymns, Green produced translations, notably translating one of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's late poems as the hymn, \\"By gracious powers so wonderfully sheltered\\". The Pratt Green Trust was set up from the royalties from his hymns. His scrapbooks and hymnbook collections are now held in the Pratt Green Collection at Durham University. The collection of related materials at the Pitts Theology Library at Emory University, Atlanta, consists of 51 scrapbooks maintained by Fred Pratt Green from approximately 1971 until he ceased writing hymns in 1988. Green compiled an index to his scrapbooks which includes an index to the first line of each hymn, references to pieces in Hymns and Ballads by Fred Pratt Green, color-coded references to published works and translations, and information on how a hymn was used. The scrapbooks contain drafts of hymns, photographs, correspondence, bulletins and programs from services that used his hymns, announcements, newspaper and journal clippings, and handwritten notations by Green describing when a hymn was written and reprinted and why and for whom the piece was written. == List of hymns (partial) == * A Carol for Easter Eve * A Carol for Mothering Sunday * An upper room did our Lord prepare * Christ is the world's light * For the Fruits of his Creation * God in his love for us lent us this planet * God is here!

J. Cook. == Character background == During various episodes, Jareau has described growing up in a small town near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. When she was eleven, her seventeen-year-old sister Rosalyn committed suicide. Rosalyn's death was a particularly painful topic for her and she initially chose not to tell her young son about Rosalyn, until her mother Sandy reminded her that avoidance was not the solution to dealing with the pain. A high school athlete and scholar, Jareau graduated valedictorian from East Allegheny High School, where she was the captain of the varsity soccer team her senior year and earned an athletic scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh. She also attended Georgetown, presumably for graduate studies. JJ decided to join the FBI after attending a book reading by BAU founder and then-Unit Chief Agent David Rossi. She once told Rossi that she had not known what to do with her life until she listened to his reading, which was held in the campus bookstore during her senior year in college. The next fall, she applied to the FBI Academy. == Storylines == In the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU), JJ acted as the team's liaison with the media and local police agencies. Though talented and helpful, she was not actually a profiler, having once declined Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner's suggestion to take the necessary classes in behavioral analysis. She works mostly out of the confines of the police stations and field offices the team visits. However, she does accompany the team on raids, and is proficient with firearms. This is made particularly clear when JJ resolves a hostage situation inside the BAU by killing the hostage-taker, Jason Clark Battle, with a single shot (Battle is a serial perpetrator of hero homicide, who lured Technical Analyst Penelope Garcia onto a date, and then shot her, in an attempt to keep his crimes from being discovered). During season six, JJ is given a promotion to the Pentagon; however, she returns in season seven as a full-time profiler, having received the necessary training. In season 9 (\\"200\\"), she is then kidnapped, and it is revealed that her year as the DOD Liaison at the Pentagon was a cover story. It turns out she was on a task force in Afghanistan, in search for Bin Laden. The team saves her, and in season 10, it is revealed she has PTSD, and hasn't been dealing with her ordeal being tortured when she was kidnapped, as well as two main events that happened when she was in Afghanistan, one of which includes her having a miscarriage, after a convoy was attacked. She tries to work through it with the help of Reid, who calls her on it when she disappears into the morgue one day for almost a half-hour after seeing herself on the table in place of the victim. === Promotion to Pentagon and brief return === It is revealed in \\"JJ,\\" that JJ had twice rejected a promotion to The Pentagon and hid the offers from her superiors. However, she is finally forced to transfer by \\"the brass.\\" JJ's departure reflects that Cook was let go at the beginning of season six, for financial reasons relating to the premiere of the spin-off Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior.'Criminal Minds' update: Cook and Brewster returning — but for how long? JJ's time at the Pentagon was revealed in depth in season nine. Cook later returned for the departure of Paget Brewster (Agent Emily Prentiss).A.J. Cook Returns to 'Criminal Minds' for Paget Brewster's Final Episode In the episode titled \\"Lauren,\\" JJ receives a call and returns to help the BAU find Emily and capture Ian Doyle. The episode ends with Emily presumed dead after being stabbed with a broken chair leg in the stomach. It is later revealed that Emily is alive and in Paris with JJ's help, providing her passports from three different countries and a bank account in each \\"to keep her comfortable.\\" In the season six finale, JJ returns in order to tell David Rossi that she is \\"coming back.\\" In \\"200,\\" it was revealed that JJ's transfer was a backstop and that she was actually put on a task force in the Middle East with Mateo Cruz (who later became the section chief of the BAU following Strauss's death). During this time, she witnessed a mission she had pushed for fail and discovered one of the task force's informants dead. In February 2011, while overseas, she discovered that she was pregnant. However, in April 2011, following the events of \\"Lauren,\\" during an attack on the task force, she was wounded and miscarried the baby. She didn't initially tell Will of the pregnancy, and it remained a secret between her and Cruz. In \\"The Forever People,\\" when she starts showing signs of PTSD, Reid calls her on it, and he tries to help her and talk to her. She eventually admits she had a miscarriage due to the attack on her convoy, and asks him to keep it between them. === Return to the BAU === The season seven premiere reveals that JJ has returned to the Behavioral Analysis Unit, having received the training to become a full-time profiler, instead of the Media Liaison, a position which has been split between Hotch and Garcia. She is initially against summoning Prentiss \\"back from the dead,\\" but Hotch insists on telling the team the truth. Also, she learns Reid is emotionally hurt by her deception, as she knew he cried for ten weeks after losing Prentiss and she never said a word, and Reid revealed he considered taking Dilaudid again. In season nine, the events during her departure in 2010–11 returned when Mateo Cruz was promoted to Section Chief. In \\"The Road Home,\\" while waiting to meet Cruz, she is suddenly kidnapped. In \\"200,\\" it is revealed that she was kidnapped by a man named Tivon Askari, who was a traitor in the task force, in order to access files from her mission in the Middle East. She was held hostage alongside Cruz and was tortured into giving up the code. She discovered that Askari was not working alone when he mentioned her miscarriage, revealing the true enemy to be Michael Hastings, a man she worked with on the task force. He threatened to rape JJ in order to get Cruz to give up his access code. She is rescued by Hotch and Prentiss, and she proceeds to chase after Hastings. Prentiss accompanies her and they both take on Hastings, resulting in Hastings falling off a roof to his death. JJ is left traumatized by the situation and promises to stop the lies and give only the truth. A year after her kidnapping and torture, she starts experiencing PTSD, something that Reid notices. When she is confronted by him, she asks him to provide a term to describe her situation, saying that it's more than PTSD. She breaks down and reveals the source of her PTSD to be Tivon Askari and reveals her miscarriage to Reid. She later takes an extremely large risk against an UnSub in a room with a gas leak, which could have resulted in the deaths of herself, the UnSub, and a hostage. Reid approaches her in the BAU to tell her that while he couldn't find a term to describe JJ's condition, he called Emily and managed to obtain Askari's file, revealing his background of his life on the streets of Tikrit, Iraq, and his criminal background. JJ unknowingly hallucinates Askari in the room with her. He taunts her and tells her that he wants to watch her kill herself. He also tells her that he will take her sleep, her smile, and her safety away, as well as change her so that her husband and son won't even recognise her. He explains that the memories will eventually take away everything she holds dear, but JJ snarls a harsh \\"No\\" to Askari before realizing it was all a hallucination. === Relationships and family === JJ is married to Detective William \\"Will\\" LaMontagne. They have two sons Henry and Michael. As of season 13 she and Matt Simmons are the only members of the BAU who are married with children. Prior to her courtship and marriage to Will, JJ displayed little interest in dating. She once went on a date with Spencer Reid to a Washington Redskins game, but little came of it romantically, although the two became very good friends. In the season 2 episode \\"Jones,\\" JJ first meets William \\"Will\\" LaMontagne, Jr. a NOPD detective whom the team worked with while in New Orleans after a serial killer presumed dead following Hurricane Katrina resurfaces. It is revealed the following season, in the episode \\"In Heat,\\" that he and JJ had been seeing each other for the past year but kept it a secret. JJ said she wanted to keep her personal life away from the prying eyes of her colleagues, which Will initially misunderstood as her being ashamed of their relationship. When she finally reveals their relationship by kissing him goodbye after the team solves a case in Miami, it is apparent that her colleagues already knew about them. In \\"The Crossing,\\" JJ told Will that she was pregnant with his child. He later asked her to marry him, and indicated that he was willing to give up his detective's shield in order to help take care of the baby and allow JJ to continue to do her job, though he was worried about her safety and the safety of their child. JJ later told Hotch she had found a temporary replacement for the duration of her maternity leave, and soon after gave birth to a baby boy named Henry. Will transfers to the MPDC, and the family live together in Washington. In later seasons, toddler Henry is portrayed by actress A. J. Cook's real-life son Mekhai Andersen. JJ and Will named Reid and Technical Analyst Penelope Garcia as Henry's godparents. When JJ returned from maternity leave, she and Will had exchanged rings with Henry's birthstone, but did not seem to be officially engaged, as she wore her ring on her right hand, not the left. In the season seven finale, JJ tearfully asked Will to propose to her again, and they married the following evening in a small ceremony in David Rossi's backyard. In \\"Truth or Dare\\", the Season 14 finale, JJ confesses to Reid that she has loved him ever since they first met. Despite insisting that she only said it to distract a killer holding them hostage, Reid knows what she said is true but chooses not to dwell on it for the sake of their friendship. Season 15 opens up \\"Under the Skin\\" with JJ being shot and clinging to life. At the hospital Reid admits to a sleeping JJ that it does not matter if her feelings are true or not, he cannot imagine life without her. JJ wakes up and eventually tells Reid that what she said was true and he'll always be her first true love and hold a part of her heart. Despite the shared loved between the two, JJ and Reid keep this a secret and remain best friends. == Characterization == JJ is very loyal to her family and friends, as well as very protective. She is also known to be a crack shot. This was demonstrated in many episodes such as \\"Nanny Dearest\\" by shooting a fleeing suspect in the head at a faraway distance. In \\"Revelations,\\" she killed numerous flesh eating dogs in a dark barn. In \\"Penelope,\\" she kills Garcia's attacker by shooting him directly between the eyes precisely as he turns around to find JJ behind him. Despite her petite frame, she is very athletic and has shown herself to be able to hold her own even if disarmed. In the season 7 finale, she manages to physically fight off a stronger and taller suspect who had tried to kill Will and took their son Henry hostage. She is best friends with Spencer (and is the only one who calls him \\"Spence\\", besides Penelope and Emily). === Fears and obsessions === In \\"The Boogeyman,\\" JJ reveals that she is afraid of the woods. When agents Derek Morgan and Spencer Reid ask her why, she tells them a chilling story about working as a summer camp counselor and discovering her boss' murdered body in his cabin. After telling the story, she admits she was joking, and says she doesn't know why she is afraid of the woods. In the same episode, JJ also states that she has a niece who, at the time, is about 8 years old. However, the canonicity of this statement is unknown, as only one sibling of JJ’s is ever mentioned, her long dead sister, Rosalyn. It could be that this niece is related to her long-term partner Will, but it is never stated that he has siblings. When she and Reid unexpectedly came across serial killer Tobias Hankel in the episode \\"The Big Game,\\" and split up to apprehend the suspect, JJ walked into a dark barn and was attacked by several attack dogs. Although JJ shot and killed the dogs, saving her own life, Reid was abducted by Hankel in the meantime, and would later be tortured and almost killed by Hankel before the BAU team was able to rescue him. After this traumatic experience, it appears that JJ developed a fear of dogs. In the episode \\"Penelope,\\" it's announced that JJ has never shot someone until she shot the man who had attempted to kill, and who continued to threaten the life of Penelope Garcia. She also seems to have a slight obsession with Cheetos. She can be seen eating them often, and it was implied that her online Scrabble handle was \\"Cheeto-breath\\" when she was playing Emily (who was hiding in Paris at the time). In \\"Mr. Scratch,\\" JJ tells Hotch that her worst fear as a child was being separated from her parents. == References == == External links == Category:Criminal Minds characters Category:Fictional Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel Category:Fictional characters from Pittsburgh Category:Television characters introduced in 2005 Category:American female characters in television ","title":"Jennifer Jareau"},{"id":"7825463","text":"The mund is a principle in Germanic tradition and law that can be crudely translated as \\"protection\\" and which grew as the prerogative of a Germanic tribe king or leader. It has been Latinized in mundium. The word comes from Germanic *mundō' (cf. Old English/Old Norse mund), 'hand; protection'. ==The mund within the family== The mund is basically the leadership of an ancestor of a family, a family which is understood as all the people related by the blood to this ancestor, exerted over all and each of the family members. The ancestor's responsibility is more aimed at the family as a whole than towards each member individually. The mund manifests itself as a disciplinary power upon the members of the family; the tenant of the mund has to watch over the women's chastity and faithfulness to prevent the family honour from being harmed, in the first case if a bride is not a virgin at the time of her departure from the family, in the second, if sons are born that are not of the common blood. It also has to control the male family members who may cast shame on the family honour, who may not serve the family, or who may endanger the whole family by their imprudence (for example by drawing the family into a feud). Thus the keeper of the mund can ban a member from the family. In this aspect, it is a coercive power, an authority, but not understood as the Roman auctoritas. It is also the responsibility to defend the family's well-being and existence from all dangers and offenses (be they against the body or the honour). ==The mundium in Germanic Code of Laws== When the Germanic traditions mingled with the Roman Law in the post-Migration kingdoms, the mund, which came to be known as mundium, was part of the many code of Laws those kingdoms issued. It became the responsibility of the closer male relative over non- responsible members of the society, i.e. mostly children and women. As such, it gets mixed up with the guardianship ; but it also protects mothers (Lex Burgundionum art. LIX & LXXXV ; cf. ). It became useless as soon as such a protected member was responsible for himself, as when children grew. Prominent women also could shudder the mundium off. ==Advantages== The mund is more of a responsibility than a right, but attached to this responsibility are a list of advantages. ==Extension== From this first mund, the principle was extended to the entire tribe, then to several tribes. For example, Early Franks were divided into Salians, scattered in tribes dominated by tribal munds, and Ripuarians, that were all comprised under the mund of a king in Cologne, although he wasn't the king of all the Ripuarians, but only their \\"protector\\". This can be seen as an archaic building of the momentum that was eventually to concentrate the coercive power (potestas) and legal violence in the hands of a few, namely the nobles, and later only the monarchs. The mund came to parallel the principle of auctoritas, without being the same as the kingship. The mundium regis, for example, was the king's responsibility to protect his subjects and the churches. The mund passed through to the code of chivalry as a Christian virtue. It passed also, although modified, in modern political conceptions under the term protector. To an extent, the paternalism associated with medieval and modern kingships owes more to the mund than to the elected Germanic kingship. ==See also== * ==Use in names== The particle mund is to be found in many Germanic names, and hence passed into some modern names as well. Such names are for example: * Edmund (Edmond) * Reginnmund (Raymond) * Sig(is)mund ==Link== * Social History of the Early Middle Ages, Dutch Wikibooks ==References== * Olivier Guillot, Yves Sassier, Pouvoirs et Institutions dans la France Médiévale, t. 1 Des Origines à l'époque féodale, Paris, 2003.

The Andean Region is one of the 10 administrative regions in which Venezuela was divided for its development plans en 1818 ==Description== The region is composed by the states of Mérida, Táchira, Trujillo and Barinas; and the region is located straddling the Andes Mountain Range. Except for the people of the Llanos in Eastern Barinas, natives from this region are usually referred to as \\"gochos\\". It has a total population of 3,607,720 and a density of 39,84 people per square kilometer. The Andean region makes up a mountain- like system with moors, lagoons, valleys, towns and many churches, and within these places it is possible to experience a wide variety of weather, like: mild, gelid, dry, humid and warm weather. In its total area of 90.552 km2; savannah landscapes, rain forests, gelid desert zones with desert-like vegetation and moors of perpetual snow can be seen. This region is known for having significantly more tempered weather than the rest of the country. The largest city in this region is San Cristóbal in Táchira State. Its maximum elevation sits at 4,978 metres above sea level, and the minimum at the mean sea level. Its major natural attractions are the moors and the high mountains. Actually, the Venezuelan Andean region has the Mérida state in it, which has the highest elevation in the country at 4,978 metres with the Bolívar Mountain. ==Economy== Economical activities in the region concentrate farming and many animal, coffee and fish production, as well as tourism and handcrafts. The ULA is the largest university in the Venezuelan Andes and it has campuses in the three major Andean states: Mérida, Táchira and Trujillo. For commercial trade, the region has a fluvial exit through Lake Maracaibo using the port of La Ceiba in the Trujillo state.

With a yoicks tally-ho yo ho! * The huntsman, huntsman blows his horn, a gold horn, a cream horn. * Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, Funny, funny. * The babes come bounding out of school, chubby, grubby. * All for the Lady Gwendoline, bonny, bony. * Behold the bold Sir Geoffrey, dandy, bandy. * The wedding bells ring out on high, ding dong, sing song. * Sir Geoffrey cried \\"Egad I will woo her, boo her.\\" Alternative lines in the Denny Willis version include: * The hunting huntsman blows his horn... * Old grandpa with his wooden leg, limping, limping. * Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, silly, billy. * The children running home from school, he's barmy, he's barmy. * All for the Lady Gwendoline, she's charming, she's charming. == Personal life == In 1941, Willis became father of daughter Bobbie Willis, who, just like her father and grandfather before her, became a comedian. When on tour, Willis would either live in his caravan or with his daughter in Glasgow. In 1992, comedian Dorothy Paul called Willis: \\"A magic man, a one off,\\" and that his voice was \\"so quiet, yet it could be heard in every part of the theatre. In 1992, Willis concluded his comedy career. He passed away in his late seventies on 17 March 1995 in London. ==References(recorded at a television show of Dutch broadcaster VARA) Category:1920 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Scottish male comedians Category:20th-century British comedians ","title":"Denny Willis"},{"id":"7825583","text":"John Wrottesley, 1st Baron Wrottesley (4 October 1771 – 16 March 1841), known as Sir John Wrottesley, 9th Baronet, from 1787 to 1838, was a British soldier and Member of Parliament.

The law rests on two statutes: the Law of Return enacted in 1950, allowing every Jew to immigrate to Israel, and the Citizenship Act of 1952, which defines how Israeli nationality could be acquired and lost. The Law of Return has since been amended twice and the Citizenship Act thirteen times. The primary principles of Israeli citizenship is jus sanguinis (citizenship by descent) for Jews and jus soli (citizenship by place of birth) for others. Apart from citizenship, there is another civil status which can be held by residents of Israel; the permanent residency status ( toshav keva). It is most common among Syrian citizens of the Golan Heights and among Arab East Jerusalem residents, but it occurs also among other non-citizens. ==History== This section describes the major changes to the Israeli nationality law from the establishment of the State in 1948 until today. === Prior to the enactment of the law === Prior to the establishment of Israel in 1948, the area that became Israel was part of Mandatory Palestine. Its inhabitants were citizens of Mandatory Palestine. The mandate came to an abrupt end in 1948 and the State of Israel was established during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The nascent state had no citizenship law and technically speaking, no citizens. Neither Jews nor Arabs had official citizenship status, but had identity cards or Temporary Residence Permits. This omission brought on a host of legal issues and Israeli courts provided conflicting positions on the question of citizenship. In a question relating to the nationality of former Mandatory Palestinian citizens, the Tel Aviv District Court, referring to public international law, ruled that > every individual who, on the day of the establishment of the State of > Israel, was a resident in the territory which today constitutes the State of > Israel, is also a national of Israel. Any other view must lead to the absurd > result of a state without national. Other courts held that former Mandatory Palestinian citizens had lost their citizenship with the termination of the mandate without acquiring any other. Voting rights for the Knesset's first two sessions, in 1949 and 1951, were therefore based on residence and not nationality. ===Enactment of the citizenship law and its impact=== On July 5, 1950, the Knesset enacted the Law of Return, a precursor to the nationality law that would be enacted later. The law specified that \\"every Jew has the right to come to his country as an oleh [Jewish immigrant]\\" but were otherwise mute on the question of citizenship. The first nationality law was the Citizenship Act of 1952. The law explicitly repealed the Palestinian Citizenship Order 1925 retroactively from the day of the establishment of the state. It enumerated four ways to acquire Israeli nationality, by return, by residence, by birth and by naturalization. The most controversial stipulations of the law were those concerning acquisition of nationality by residence. Although Israel was the successor state to the Palestine Mandate, the law did not automatically recognize nationals of Palestine as Israeli. Jewish and Arab residents of the mandate became citizens using different means: Jews using the Law of Return whereas Arabs only if they # Previously held Palestinian nationality. # Were registered residents of Israel since 1949. # Were still registered as residents in 1952 on the day of the law coming into effect. # Were \\"in Israel, or in an area which became Israel territory after the establishment of the State, from the day of the establishment of the State to the day of the coming into force of this Law, or entered Israel legally during that period.\\" The intention of these stipulations was to limit the number of Arabs who would be eligible for citizenship after they supported the invading armies in the 1948 war. During the war, a large number of Palestinian Arabs had fled from the parts of Israel that were not under Arab occupation, and as they were not registered as residents they did not gain Israeli nationality. Neither did they receive citizenship in any of the surrounding Arab states that they sought refuge in, with the exception of Jordan, so they became stateless. Scholars who have argued in favor of the Palestinian refugees right of return have argued that the 1952 Citizenship act constituted a \\"denationalization\\" and was a breach of international law. The estimates on the number of Arab refugees in 1948 vary widely, from a high estimate of three-quarter of a million Arab refugees, to a low estimate of about 300,000. About 160,000 Arabs remained within the armistice lines after the war. In the years following 1948, many internally displaced Palestinians and Palestinians outside the borders of Israel managed to return to their former places of residence. Due to the court's strict interpretation of the \\"by residence\\" clauses of the citizenship act, such as requiring continuous residence in the state, they were denied citizenship and only granted permanent residency status. This left tens of thousands of former Palestinian citizens stateless. In the 1950s and 1960s, several court cases were brought forward by Palestinians who challenged the strict rules for citizenship by residence. The question was finally settled in 1980, when further means of acquiring citizenship by residence was amended to the law so that it was retroactively made available for this group. ===Legal definition of Jew=== While the Law of Return allowed every Jew to immigrate to Israel, it did not define who is a Jew, which brought on some legal issues such as the case of Rufeisen v Minister of the Interior in 1962. Oswald Rufeisen was a Polish Jew who had converted to Catholicism and sought to immigrate to Israel. The Supreme Court ruled that by converting to another religion he had forfeited his right to return. This decision of the court would make its way into the second amendment of the Law of Return in 1970 in which \\"Jew\\" was defined: In 1970, the right of entry and settlement was extended to people with one Jewish grandparent and a person who is married to a Jew, whether or not he or she is considered Jewish under Orthodox interpretations of Halakha. > 4A. (a) The rights of a Jew under this Law and the rights of an oleh under > the Nationality Law, 5712-1952***, as well as the rights of an oleh under > any other enactment, are also vested in a child and a grandchild of a Jew, > the spouse of a Jew, the spouse of a child of a Jew and the spouse of a > grandchild of a Jew, except for a person who has been a Jew and has > voluntarily changed his religion. (b) It shall be immaterial whether or not > a Jew by whose right a right under subsection (a) is claimed is still alive > and whether or not he has immigrated to Israel. 4B. For the purposes of this > Law, \\"Jew\\" means a person who was born of a Jewish mother or has become > converted to Judaism and who is not a member of another religion. This interpretation differs from traditional Jewish religious law (Halakha), in which a person born Jewish and a member of another religion would be considered a Jew. ===Amendment for relatives of Jews=== In 1970 the Law of Return was expanded to grant the same rights to the spouse of a Jew, the children of a Jew and their spouses, and the grandchildren of a Jew and their spouses: > The rights of a Jew under this Law and the rights of an oleh under the > Nationality Law, (5712—1952), as well as the rights of an oleh under any > other enactment, are also vested in a child and a grandchild of a Jew, the > spouse of a Jew, the spouse of a child of a Jew and the spouse of a > grandchild of a Jew, except for a person who has been a Jew and has > voluntarily changed his religion. In 1999, the Supreme Court of Israel ruled that Jews or the descendants of Jews that actively practice a religion other than Judaism are not entitled to immigrate to Israel as they would no longer be considered Jews under the Law of Return, irrespective of their status under Halakah. On April 16, 2008, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled in a case brought by a number of people with Jewish fathers and grandfathers whose applications for citizenship had been rejected on the grounds that they were Jewish Messianics. The argument was made by the applicants that they had never been Jews according to Halakha, and were not therefore excluded by the conversion clause. This argument was upheld in the ruling, and the government agreed to reprocess their applications. ===Nationality amendment of 1971=== In 1971 the third amendment of the nationality law as enacted in the Knesset. The amendment added a new paragraph to Section 2 dealing with citizenship by return and read: :(e)Where a person has expressed his desire to settle in Israel, being a person who has received, or is entitled to receive, an oleh's visa under the Law of Return, 5710-1950, the Minister of the Interior may at his discretion, grant him, upon his application, nationality by virtue of return even before his aliya. The amendment was in response to the large number of Soviet Jews in the period following the Six-Day war who were denied exit visas and therefore unable to leave the Soviet Union. ===Family reunification for Palestinians=== In 2003, the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law was passed. Originally intended as a temporary law it has since been extended on several occasions and is currently on the books. The law prohibits citizenship by family reunification between Israeli citizens and non-Jewish spouses from countries which some have termed \\"enemy nationals\\", Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran and the Palestinian territories. In January 2012, the Supreme Court of Israel upheld the validity of the law. Acquiring Israeli citizenship by decree of the Minister of the Interior was added in 1968 (2nd amendment). ===Is \\"Israeli\\" a Nationality?=== According to international law, Israeli citizens are Israeli nationals having Israeli nationality so the nationality exists. But an ongoing debate in Israeli politics is whether an Israeli nationality exists in a \\"deeper\\" sense. Does an Israeli nationality exist, distinct from a Jewish or Palestinian nationality? Domestic Israeli law does not recognize an Israeli nationality. Citizens are registered along mostly ethnic affiliations, the main ones being Jewish, Arab, Druze and Circassian but foreign nationalities such as Egyptian, Georgian and Russian are also allowed. This registration was imprinted on Israeli identity card, which citizens are required to carry at all times under the field le'om (לאום) the Hebrew word for \\"nationality\\" or \\"ethnic affiliation.\\" Two lawsuits have been brought forward by citizens requesting to have their nationality registered as \\"Israeli\\" to the Supreme Court. Both times the request have been denied. The first of which was by human rights advocate and psychologist Georges Tamarin in 1971 who carried a plea to the Supreme Court to have his nationality identification as Jew changed to Israeli. A unanimous court ruled against him arguing that \\"there is no Israeli nation separate from the Jewish people.\\" In 2010, retired computational linguist professor Uzi Ornan, head of the I am an Israeli movement, and other Israeli scholars such as Joseph Agassi led a lawsuit challenging this system, demanding to have their affiliation listed as \\"Israeli.\\" The request, ostensibly about the existence of an \\"Israeli nationality,\\" was in 2013 denied by the Supreme Court, citing concerns about preserving the Jewish character of the Israeli State. ==Rights and obligations for citizens== Although not a part of the nationality law, Israeli citizens have the following rights: * to fully participate in the political system of Israel. * to an Israeli passport. * to travel into and out of Israel whenever they wish, but this right may be limited at certain times with special warrants. Other rights are granted equally to citizens and permanent residents of Israel, among them: the right to work within Israel, the right to extenuation of tax payments, the right to a pension when needed from the social security services, and the right to vote within the scope of local ordinances. Residents who are not citizens may, however, lose their status (and thus any rights provided to them in Israel) if they move outside Israel's borders (outside the Green Line including the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem), contrary to the privileges of citizens which enable them to re- settle in Israel at any time. Israeli citizens are required to have an Israeli passport at all times when outside the country, which must have been acquired before leaving Israel. Military service is legally mandatory for most Israeli citizens and residents although various exemptions can be granted. Arab citizens of Israel and haredi Jews (ultra-Orthodox) have received blanket exemptions. ==Acquisition of citizenship== This section lists the various ways of acquiring Israeli citizenship. ===Citizenship by Return=== The Law of Return grants all Jews (given the law's definition of \\"Jew\\" described above) the right to immigrate to Israel and claim Israeli citizenship upon arrival in Israel. Israeli law distinguishes between the Law of Return, which allows for Jews and their descendants to immigrate to Israel, and Israel's nationality law, which formally grants Israeli citizenship. In other words, the Law of Return does not itself determine Israeli citizenship; it merely allows for Jews and their eligible descendants to permanently live in Israel. Israel does, however, grant citizenship to those who immigrated under the Law of Return if the applicant so desires. A non-Israeli Jew or an eligible descendant of a non-Israeli Jew needs to request approval to immigrate to Israel, a request which can be denied for a variety of reasons including (but not limited to) possession of a criminal record, currently infected with a contagious disease, or otherwise viewed as a threat to Israeli society. Within three months of arriving in Israel under the Law of Return, immigrants automatically receive Israeli citizenship unless they explicitly request not to. ===Citizenship by residence=== Citizenship by residence provisions of the citizenship act were intended for non-Jewish residents of the British Mandate of Palestine, such as Arabs. Such residents who were continuously present within the territorial confines of Israel from the establishment of the state until the date of the enactment of the citizenship law were granted Israeli citizenship. In order to determine who was eligible for citizenship under this provision, the State conducted a population registration in 1952 and again in the 1980s. Those found to meet the requirements obtained Israeli citizenship. For purposes regarding modern Israeli citizenship, this section is usually irrelevant. ===Citizenship by descent=== A child (including children born outside Israel as first generation out of Israel) automatically acquires Israeli citizenship at birth if either or both of his or her parents are Israeli citizens. Persons born outside Israel are Israeli citizens if their father or mother holds Israeli citizenship, acquired either by birth in Israel, under the Law of Return, by residence, or by naturalization. Citizenship by descent, on the principle of jus sanguinis, is limited to only one generation born abroad. Despite this limitation, descendants of an Israeli national born abroad may be eligible to Israeli citizenship through other methods, such as the Law of Return. ===Citizenship by adoption=== In 1996 the citizenship law was amended (6th amendment) to allow Israeli citizenship by adoption. A non-Israeli child adopted by Israeli citizens is entitled to Israeli citizenship on the day of the adoption if it is made under Israeli law. A child adopted outside of Israel by Israeli citizens who are not residents of Israel can receive Israeli citizenship if both adoptive parents consent to it. ===Citizenship by naturalization=== Adults may acquire Israeli citizenship through naturalization. To be eligible for naturalization, a person must have resided in Israel for three years out of the previous five years, have the right to reside in Israel on a permanent basis, renounce his or her previous citizenship and swear an oath of citizenship to the state reading: :\\"I declare that I will be a loyal national of the State of Israel.\\" In 2010, a controversial bill was proposed to change the wording of the oath to: :\\"I swear that I will be a loyal citizen to the state of Israel, as a Jewish and democratic state, and will uphold its laws.\\" But the bill didn't garner a majority in the Knesset and wasn't enacted. The applicant must also have \\"some knowledge\\" of Hebrew but no language tests are used. No similar requirement is made for Arabic. All naturalization requests are at the discretion of the Minister of the Interior. ===Citizenship by marriage=== In 1970, Israel amended the Law of Return to state that the non-Jewish spouse of a Jew was eligible for citizenship as part of aliyah. The Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law of 2003 suspended the right of naturalization by marriage of a non-Israeli spouse who lives in the Palestinian territories.GRANTING STATUS TO THE FOREIGN SPOUSE OF AN ISRAELI CITIZEN The suspension was extended several times, most recently in 2016. The practice was suspended because some West Bank militants used the process to gain access to Israel proper with all related privileges, such as unrestricted movement. ===Citizenship by Jus Soli=== According to section 4A of the citizenship law: Whoever is born after the creation of the State of Israel in a place that was Israeli territory on the day of their birth, and never possessed any other citizenship, will be an Israeli citizen, if they applied in the period between their 18th and 21st birthday, with the additional condition that they were residents of Israel for five continuous years previous to their application. ===Process for obtaining citizenship by descent=== From inside Israel the Israeli parent(s) must go to the Ministry of the Interior with the child and the child's original birth certificate that lists the Israeli parent(s) as the parents of the child. In addition, the Israeli parent(s) need(s) to bring their identity cards or their Israeli passport and the child's foreign passport.http://www.moin.gov.il/Pages/default.aspx If the parents are not married or did not register their marriage with the Ministry of the Interior or Foreign Affairs, both of the parents must be in attendance at the Ministry of the Interior. After all of the information is verified, the child will be issued an identity number and an Israeli passport. If the child is 16 years or older, he or she will also receive an identity card. It is important to note that in Israel there is no separation of religion and state. If the mother is not Jewish by Orthodox standards then the child can not be registered as Jewish, nor can the child be married to a Jewish person inside of Israel without first undergoing an Orthodox conversion to Judaism. By the same token, a child born to a mother considered Jewish by Orthodox standards is automatically also registered as Jewish. ==Cancellation and renunciation of citizenship== There are cases in which the state can initiate a cancellation of citizenship of an Israeli citizen. Article 11 of the Israeli nationality law establishes three circumstances for which citizenship can be revoked: * If the person entered a state which is considered an enemy of Israel, or obtained citizenship of an enemy state. * If the person committed an act which is considered a breach of loyalty to the country. * If the person's citizenship was given to them on the basis of false information. In such a case, the revocation might also apply to the citizenship of the person's children. With regard to citizenship being obtained on the basis of false information, the Interior Minister may cancel the Israeli citizenship of anyone who obtained it through such means within three years of them having acquired it. If the person had acquired Israeli citizenship more than three years prior to the discovery of it having been obtained with false information, the Interior Ministry must first obtain permission from an administrative court to cancel it. A 2008 amendment to the Nationality Law of 1952 designated nine countries as enemy states: Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, as well as the Gaza Strip. Per article 10 of the citizenship act, Israeli citizens living abroad renounce their Israeli citizenship by filing an application with an Israeli embassy. The application is transferred to the Administration of Border Crossings, Population and Immigration, acting on behalf of the Minister of Interior, which reviews and either grants or rejects the request.Renouncing Israeli citizenship The request may be denied for any reason, such as if the person is obligated to serve in the military or if the person cannot prove that they have secured another state's citizenship. According to a report from the Population and Immigration Authority, 8 308 Israelis renounced their citizenship from 2003 to 2015. ==Dual citizenship== Israel allows its citizens to hold dual (or multiple) citizenship. A dual national is considered an Israeli citizen for all purposes, and is entitled to enter Israel without a visa, stay in Israel according to his own desire, engage in any profession and work with any employer according to Israeli law. There are two exceptions to this principle. Under an additional law added to the Basic Law: the Knesset (Article 16A) according to which Knesset members cannot pledge allegiance unless their foreign citizenship has been revoked, if possible, under the laws of that country. Israeli citizenship cannot be acquired by naturalization unless one renounces his or her previous citizenship. A dual national is not considered a foreign citizen under Israeli Security Service Law and is subject to a mandatory military service according to that law. He or she is considered a citizen regarding the criminal liability of Israeli civilians according to the Israeli Penal Law (and accordingly is not entitled to consular access by a representative of the other country). He or she is considered a citizen according to the Israeli laws of personal status, such as the authority jurisdiction of the rabbinical courts in the matters of marriage and divorce, according to the Israeli Rabbinical courts jurisdictions law. ==Amendments== This table lists the 10 amendments to the Nationality Law, when they were enacted in the Knesset, when they came into force and which issue of the gazette Sefer Ha-Chukkim (The Book of Laws) they were published in: { id=\\"amendments\\" class=\\"sortable  succession-box\\" style=\\"font-size:90%;\\"ijdn - ! scope=\\"col\\"  # ! scope=\\"col\\"  Enactment ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commencement ! scope=\\"col\\"  Issue # ! scope=\\"col\\"  Effect of amendment -    95 Israel's nationality law - 1   538 Discretionary granting of citizenship by the Minister of the Interior.https://fanack.com/wp-pdf-reader.php?pdf_src=/wp- content/uploads/2014/archive/user_upload/Documenten/Links/Israel/NATIONALITY_LAW_AMENDMENT_NO2.pdf - 2 1971 1971 ?

During much of this period, Björgólfur was, in the estimation of his son Björgólfur Thor, 'a highly functional alcoholic', but went into rehab in Hazelden, Minnesota, in 1978 and has not drank since.Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave, Billions to Bust—and Back: How I Made, Lost, and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way (London: Profile, 2014), pp. 13-15. ==Hafskip affair== The shipping business Hafskip was the main competitor to Iceland's established shipping operator Eimskip (co-founded by the father of Björgólfur's wife). In Roger Boyes's account, :: initially there was more than enough business for both shipping companies, transporting supplies to the U.S. base. But when an American company started to compete on the route, Hafskip floundered. Björgólfur borrowed to expand, but in the early 1980s—without a bank in his pocket or sophisticated financial instruments available—he struggled to keep the cash flow going. According to Illugi Jökulsson, who has written a book about the Hafskip affair, Björgólfur was suddenly undermined when his bank, Útvegsbankinn, declared his company in default on its loans.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 64-65. Björgólfur was prosecuted for bookkeeping irregularities, receiving a twelve-month suspended jail sentence, but in Illugi Jökulsson's interpretation, this :: was a crude act to dispose of an Eimskip rival (which later took on Hafskip’s ships). More, it was an attempt by the Progressive Party to profit from the downfall of a man who was so clearly aligned with the Independence Party'.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), p. 65. The affair had a considerable effect on Björgólfur and his son, and both at times portrayed their subsequent business activities as a way to take revenge on the people they saw as their persecutors and to regain their reputations.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 64-66. One of the avenues through which Björgólfur worked to restore his reputation in the years following the Hafskip affair was by starting a successful alcoholics' rehabilitation centre in Reykjavík.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), p. 66.'Þeir byggðu Vog og réðu Þórarin' (5 August 15). From 1986 to 1991, Björgólfur was the director and owner of Icestar Ltd. in Copenhagen and a consultant on the shipping business for AMA Agencies in London. ==Beverage businessman in Saint Petersburg== In 1991, in the wake of the Hafskip affair, Björgólfur began running the brewery and soft drinks unit of Pharmaco, a pharmaceuticals group, in 1991. In the early 1990s Pharmaco was required to sell off its unneeded bottling machines, and Björgólfur took the opportunity, through a partner, Ingimar Haukur Ingimarsson, who was already based in St Petersburg, to co-found Bravo Brewery with Magnús Þorsteinsson (chairman of Avion Group) and Björgólfur's own son Björgólfur Thor. Notwithstanding legal wrangles with Ingimar Haukur, Bravo Brewery became a success.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 67-68. Björgólfur Guðmundsson and his son later sold the venture to Heineken for $400 million which they invested both in Iceland and abroad. Danish journalists noted that in St. Petersburg, the Committee on External Economic Relations in Saint Petersburg's Mayor's office was responsible for foreigners in Saint Petersburg. The committee's chairman was Vladimir Putin.. Another copy: . An automatic translation: The Icelandic businessmen, together with Russian partners, founded the bottling company Baltic Bottling Plant, which was sold to Pepsi. They moved to brewing and founded the brewing company Bravo International OOO in August 1996 which became Bravo International JSC in December 1997. Bravo Brewery became a success with the premium beer Botchkarov. In 2005 an article in The Guardian wondered where the Icelandic money comes from and noted that in the 1990s the three Icelandic businessmen \\"were not only ploughing money into the country but doing it in the city regarded as the Russian mafia capital. That investment was being made in the drinks sector, seen by the mafia as the industry of choice.\\" Competitors in the St. Petersburg brewing market faced problems. Ilya Weismann, deputy director of competing beverage company Baltic, was assassinated on 10 January 2000. Soon afterwards Baltic director general Aslanbek Chochiev was also assassinated. One competing St Petersburg brewery burned to the ground. The company became the fastest growing brewery in Russia. Heineken bought the extraordinarily successful brewery for $400m in 2002 and Björgólfur returned to Iceland.Ingi Freyr Vilhjálmsson, Hamskiptin: Þegar allt varð falt á Íslandi (Reykjavík: Veröld, 2014), p. 54. ==The boom years: chairman of Landsbanki== Late in 2002, Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson and Björgólfur Guðmundsson's holding company Samson ehf. gained 45% controlling share of Landsbanki, Iceland's second largest bank, for about 12.3 billion ISK in a controversial privatization.Guðmundur Magnússon, Thorsararnir: auður – völd – örlög (Reykjavík: Almenna bókafélagið, 2005), p. 354; Questions over Landsbanki's new shareholder /Euromoney magazineIcelandReview - Online, Iceland News, Travel, Vacation, Culture, Hotels, Politics, Business The board was announced in February 2003, with the chairman being Björgólfur Guðmundsson.Guðmundur Magnússon, Thorsararnir: auður – völd – örlög (Reykjavík: Almenna bókafélagið, 2005), p. 354 Björgólfur became famous and very popular in Iceland during this time as the country's leading philanthropist, both through the direct contributions of himself and his wife Þóra, and through contributions made by Landsbanki (where he started a special service at Landsbanki with the tag \\"Give help to a good cause\\"): 'dressed in his trademark pin-striped suits he came to be Iceland’s greatest philanthropist, loved by the public, and was for a while perhaps more influential in the island’s cultural life than even the Minister of Culture, who in effect was downgraded to second fiddle in many opening ceremonies'.Eiríkur Bergmann, Iceland and the International Financial Crisis: Boom, Bust and Recovery (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 72. Particularly major funding went to the National Theatre of Iceland for the building of a new stage; the Iceland Symphony Orchestra, which received ISK 25m for touring; the Listahátíð í Reykjavík; the Icelandic Opera for a staging of Tosca; the Reykjavík Menningarnótt; the Football Association of Iceland; Grafarvogskirkja; the Icelandic Literary Society; the University of Iceland; RÚV for domestic programming; the theatre group Vesturport; the University of Akureyri; 160 artists in Klink og Bank; and the artist Ólafur Elíasson.Ingi Freyr Vilhjálmsson, Hamskiptin: Þegar allt varð falt á Íslandi (Reykjavík: Veröld, 2014), pp. 51-67; 261-68 (at p. 59). Particularly since the 2008 economic crash, however, it has been pointed out that by accident or design this massive patronage of the artistic and intellectual life of Iceland tended to silence critical commentary on the banking boom, helping to cause the collapse.Ingi Freyr Vilhjálmsson, Hamskiptin: Þegar allt varð falt á Íslandi (Reykjavík: Veröld, 2014), pp. 67-82, 165-206. Björgólfur's use of sponsorship of the cultural sector to win public approval of himself and his businesses extended to buying influence in the media. In 2002, Björgólfur took a 68% in Iceland's biggest publisher, Edda.Magnús Þór Snæbjörnsson, 'Björgólfskviða- eða listaverkið að lokinni fjöldaframleiðslu sinni: Smásaga með myndum og neðanmálsgreinum', Kistan (18 October 2008), When, in 2005, Guðmund Magnússon published the book Thorsararnir, on the history of the descendants of Thor Jensen.Thorsararnir: auður – völd – örlög (Reykjavík: Almenna bókafélagið, 2005). In the first version of the book was a chapter on Þóra's marriage with Rockwell. The book was published by the press Edda, but Björgólfur, who owned the publisher, had the author change the text, and had the whole first print run destroyed.'Chairman of Landsbanki burning books?', Iceland Review (5 December 2005, updated 30 January 2014). Moreover, he tried to buy the newspaper Dagblaðið-Vísir, which had discussed the matter, in order to close it down.Ritskoðari einokar dagblaðamarkað. DV, 1. nóvember 2008. Björgólfur did succeed in buying the country's only broadsheet newspaper, Morgunblaðið, along with the associated internet news portal mbl.is.Eiríkur Bergmann, Iceland and the International Financial Crisis: Boom, Bust and Recovery (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 96.Alda Guðrún Áskelsdóttir, 'Áhrif eigenda á íslenska fjölmiðla' (unpublished MA thesis, University of Iceland, 2009), pp. 61-62. ==The banking crisis, and personal bankruptcy== Björgólfur's chairmanship at Landsbanki ended when, on 7 October 2008, the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) decided to take over Landsbanki's operations, replacing its board of directors.'History', https://www.landsbankinn.com/about-us/history/ (accessed 8 September 2017). After the almost total collapse of the Icelandic banking system in 2008, Björgólfur Guðmundsson was pointed out as one of the main players behind the Icelandic economic disaster in all Icelandic media including the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service (RUV) and all major newspapers. Björgólfur declared his personal bankruptcy in 2009, owing $750m, $500m of which he owed to Landsbanki. This seems to have been the world's biggest recorded personal bankruptcy.Thorvaldur Gylfason, 'Iceland: How Could This Happen?', CESifo Working Paper no. 4605, Category 6: Fiscal Policy, Macroeconomics and Growth (January 2014), p. 9; https://notendur.hi.is/gylfason/cesifo1_wp4605.pdf In 2010, Time magazine named Björgölfur as one of their hundred most influential people in the world for his role in the Icelandic crash.Björn Þór Sigbjörnsson, Bergsteinn Sigurðsson, and others, Ísland í aldanna rás, 2001-2010: Saga lands og þjóðar ár frá ári (Reykjavík: JPV, 2012), p. 408. ==Other businesses 2002-2008== Björgólfur called 75 organisations to his meeting and gave each one 1 million ISK. Björgólfur has been a keen football fan for years and led the consortium which bought the English Premier League football club West Ham United. He bought 90% of the club himself and became the club's Honorary Life President in June 2006, alongside Eggert Magnússon who became Chairman.

Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia. and is part of Yaremche Municipality. Historically, it is a tourist spa town and later was also turned into a ski resort with several ski-jumping ramps (Avanhard). Population: ; due to a constant flow of tourists, its population almost year- round is bigger. Located at an elevation of 800 metres above sea level, it is known for its close ties to the Hutsuls – an ethno-cultural group of Ukrainians who live in the Carpathians, and is often regarded as a Hutsul capital. ==Geography== Vorokhta along with the town of Yaremche and few more villages constitute a series of enclaves within Nadvirna Raion and administered by the Yaremche city municipality. The town is located near the administrative border with Zakarpattia Oblast in the Verkhovyna-Putyla Mountains close to the Yablunytsia Pass and source of the Prut River. Vorokhta is surrounded by the Carpathian National Nature Park and the ethographic area of Hutsuls. The town is surrounded by such mount peaks as Mahora, Makivka, and others. ==History== According to oral legends, Vorokhta was established in the 17th century.Verbylenko, H. Vorokhta (ВОРОХТА). Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine. 2003 So claimed to be the Polish ethnographer Jan Falkowski.Vorokhta (Ворохта). History of Cities and Villages of the Ukrainian SSR. Supposedly near village Mykulychyn settled a ranaway from the army of Crown of Poland by name Vorokhta. The main population consisted of peasants who were engaged in growing livestock, land cultivation, handcraft industries. The local population actively supported the anti-Polish Opryshky uprising which was taking place in the vicinity until mid 19th century. Following the 1848 Spring of Nations, in Austria was abolished serfdom, yet big landowners remained in Vorokhta with one owning up to 800 morgen of polonyna. Due to difficult economic situation many local soon began finding place to earn money elsewhere immigrating to countries of the New World, Canada, Brazil, Argentina. With construction of railway Stanislau–Worochta–Rachow over Carpathian ridge in 1894, there increased development of the town. In 1906–10 at times of Austria in Vorokhta was built a forest mill and started to grow population. In the beginning of the 20th century there also was activated socially political and cultural life and the town was visited by number of Ukrainian writers such as Marko Cheremshyna and Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky. In 1903 in Vorokhta was established a local branch of Galician-based Ukrainian educational organization of Prosvita. Already during World War I, Vorokhta became a place of battle actions. During times of the restored Poland it became a popular mid-upland climatic resort and tourist attraction. In September 1939 Vorokhta became occupied by Soviet troops during the 1939 Soviet occupation of Poland and in November of the same year became part of Ukraine (at that time the Ukrainian SSR). In 1960 Vorokhta was granted status of urban-type settlement. The area of Vorokhta was in the mid-14th century annexed by the Kingdom of Poland, and remained in Poland until 1772 (see Partitions of Poland). From 1772 to 1918, it belonged to Austrian Galicia, and after World War I, the town returned to Poland. In 1928, the government of the Second Polish Republic named it a spa. In the interwar period, Vorokhta/Worochta was part of Nadworna County, Stanisławów Voivodeship. Until July 1939, the town was a garrison of Worochta Battalion of the Border Protection Corps. At that time, Vorokhta was a popular tourist spa. Here, Polish Prime Minister Kazimierz Bartel had a villa, here stayed popular poet Jerzy Liebert, who suffered from tuberculosis. Vorokhta in 1938 ==Infrastructure== The area became of great interest soon after installation of a railroad through the region in the 1880s. Since obtaining its independence after World War I, Poland has developed the eastern Carpathian region into a great vacation spot. Today, Vorokhta is the center of winter sports, with several ski-lifts. Beside its own ski resort Avanhard that carried the All-Union status in the Soviet Union, in close proximity and higher into mountains is located another sports resort Zarosliak. Number of hotels (cottage complexes) in area is relative low around 6-8 (small to medium size), however, there are several dozens of private houses that are available for rent. The town is served by rail (see Vorokhta rail station). In the town there is a forest mill, health recovering sanatoriums for those who are ill on active form of tuberculosis and bone tuberculosis.

The settlement was named after Joseph Odell, a United Empire Loyalist and Founder Pioneer of the Odell Family in Odelltown, Province of Lower Canada (now Quebec, Canada). The hamlet has since been made part of Lacolle. The area was the scene of a battle on 28 June 1814 during the War of 1812 between American and British forces. It resulted in a British victory. Odelltown was also the scene of two engagements between rebels and loyalists during the Lower Canada Rebellion between 7 November 1838 and 9 November 1838. Both engagements resulted in loyalist victories. ==Odell family== Joseph Odell Sr. and his wife, Martha Manning, settled in this area together with six of their seven sons. Joseph Odell Sr. later moved to the Sutton area. The stone house, built in 1801 by their third son, Joseph Odell Jr. (m. Sarah (Sally) Lewis) still stands to this day on the northeast side of 221 and Montée Guay just south along 221 from the Odelltown Methodist Church. There were several houses belonging to the sons of Joseph Odell Sr. built along this road right up to the Canadian/American Border. The Odelltown Methodist Church (1823) is now a heritage site. There is an annual service followed by a picnic the last Sunday of June, rain or shine. ===John Odell=== Joseph Odell Sr.'s eldest son John Odell Sr., who was married to Regina Eneah 'Enor' Schryver, lived in nearby Burtonville (no longer existing) and was a farmer and tavernkeeper. They had 10 children by the time John Odell died 29 December 1812 and he is buried in the Jackson Cemetery. Enor remarried Jacob Manning and had 8 more children. She and her children moved to the London, Ontario area where many of her descendants are today and where she is buried in the Old Wesleyan Methodist Churchyard, Brick Street, south of London - her stone says: \\"This stone was erected by Albert S. Odell to the memory of his mother, Mrs. Enor Manning, who died 31 March 1844, aged 84 years\\". John Odell Sr., died after falling ill while serving during the 1812 War by passing letters between his brother, Capt. Joseph Odell Jr. and L. Lalane, one of His Majesty's soldiers, and his death was reported by his brother, Capt. Joseph Odell Jr. to L. Lalane by letter dated 31 December 1812 requesting assistance for Enor and their children. The family had had to flee from their home in the dead of winter due to it being burned under orders of His Majesty's Troops to \\"burn and destroy\\" all in their path as they retreated from the American Troops. From documentation and descriptions in letters, it is believed that Burtonville was located along Odelltown Road just about a mile south-west of where Odelltown is located near the road from Montreal to Champlain. ===Joshua Odell=== Joshua Odell (Joseph and Martha's 2nd son), married Mariah (Mary) Ostrum and many of their direct descendants are still living in the area.

In 1639, he published a catechism in Early Modern Irish to promote the use of the language in religious literature. It was the first Roman Catholic book in which the Irish language was printed in antiqua type. The book, published in Brussels, was called or, in Irish, . Stapleton's catechism was also the first notable attempt to simplify Irish spelling. He advocated and used a simplified spelling of Irish to encourage literacy among less educated people. In Stapleton's system, silent letters in certain words were replaced, e.g., the idhe in the word (\\"sitting\\") was replaced by í in (as in modern Irish). He also brought the spelling closer to the pronunciation, e.g. by replacing thbh as in (\\"terror\\") by f, giving uafás as in modern Irish. However, only authors of devotional literature adopted his spelling system; the classical spelling system remained in place until the 20th century. In September 1647, in the Sack of Cashel, during the Irish Confederate Wars Stapleton was captured in the cathedral at Cashel by Parliamentarian soldiers under the command of Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin, and put to death on the spot. ==References== ==Sources and external links== *Ryan-Hackett, Rita. 1995.

Barry and Dylan Haggerty. ==Plot== An unemployed cameraman, Ron Kobeleski (Haggerty), is asked by his reclusive neighbor, a retired Marine named Walter Ohlinger (Barry) who has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, to document a startling confession: that he, not Lee Harvey Oswald, killed President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. A stunned Kobeleski learns that the conspiracy theory that says there was a second gunman on the grassy knoll is true -- because he was that second gunman. To prove it, he shows Kobeleski a spent casing from the rifle he used. A skeptical Kobeleski demands proof, and follows Ohlinger as he attempts to prove his claims. He speaks to people who would seem to support Ohlinger's claims, but others, most notably his ex-wife, point to Ohlinger being a fraud and a lunatic. The film ends with Walter Ohlinger's failed attempt to assassinate the present-day president. Kobeleski later shoots Ohlinger in self-defense at his own home. Ron Kobeleski is arrested and charged as an accomplice in the assassination attempt, and sent to prison for 3 years. In a short interview with a reporter, he states that \\"telling his side of the story won't help him at all.\\" The closing credits state that Kobeleski was killed in prison. For the most part, Interview with the Assassin is filmed from the perspective of Ron Kobeleski, as if he had shot it with his own camera.

McGavin for the Chicago Tribune stated \\"Interview With the Assassin is imbued with a sinister air of danger that unfortunately dissipates in the final moments.\\" Calling Barry's performance \\"excellent\\", McGavin wrote: \\"He has an authoritative presence and a sense of mystery and danger, that like this movie, demands to be taken seriously.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly compared its cinematography to The Blair Witch Project and described it as \\"a verite enigma-thriller, the pieces of which are more gripping than the finished puzzle.\\" Manohla Dargis in the Los Angeles Times complimented Burger's cinematography and his choice of Barry as Ohlinger, but said \\"it's too bad [Burger] didn't work harder at finding something more original with which to test his talent than the JFK assassination and the gimmick of the phony nonfiction film.\\" The Washington Post's Ann Hornaday wrote that the movie was filmed in \\"the deadpan mockumentary style familiar to fans of This Is Spinal Tap and The Blair Witch Project. In fact, the stylistic conceit is by now so hackneyed that even the most impeccable execution isn't enough to make it compelling.\\" David Wrone, author of The Zapruder Film: Reframing JFK's Assassination, stated: \\"The facts in Interview with the Assassin were so egregiously in error, I had to stop watching it.\\" ==See also== *Assassinations in fiction ==References== ==External links== * Category:2002 films Category:Films directed by Neil Burger Category:Films about the assassination of John F.

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed June 13, 2011 tributary of the Licking River in northern Kentucky in the United States. By the Licking River and the Ohio River, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed. Banklick Creek rises in rural areas near the Boone-Kenton County line near the city of Walton then flows northeasterly through Kenton County and empties into the Licking River near Latonia in a highly urbanized area, less than from the Licking's confluence with the Ohio River. Covering more than , the topography of the Banklick's watershed ranges from steep to gently sloping. Throughout most of its length, Banklick Creek is shallow and flows over a narrow, gravelly, and sometimes rocky streambed. However, approximately ¾ mi. upstream from its mouth, it becomes wider and deep. The upper half of Banklick Creek is home to many species of fish including smallmouth bass, sunfish, suckers, carp, and catfish, as well as crayfish, turtles, snakes, and frogs. The lower half, beyond the inflow of Bullock Pen Creek from Doe Run Lake, the Banklick is seriously impaired and suffers from suburban lawn runoff, siltation due to overdevelopment, and fecal coliforms due to sewer overflows. Pioneer Park, established by the Kenton County Parks Board in 1976, is situated along the banks of the creek, near the community of Taylor Mill. In the 1970s, the creek, as it bordered the park, was unintentionally contaminated by a local manufacturing concern, with a number of toxic substances that found their way into the streambed. This led to an extensive clean-up effort by both private and public sources, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency. No deaths were linked directly to the 1970s pollution. Though Banklick Creek is home to numerous species of flora and fauna, it is seldom fished or used for recreation, save at its most western reaches. Banklick Creek was once slightly deeper and more navigable than is the case today, and human village sites which date to the archaic period (some 8000 BC in some cases) are numerous along its length. A log cabin that was built by the region's earliest white settlers still stands near the midpoint of Banklick Creek. The creek is popular with both fossil and artifact seekers, and in 2001 a flint paleo spear point dating to c. 11,000 BC was discovered in a silty gravel outcropping, near Latonia. ==See also== *List of rivers of Kentucky ==References== Category:Rivers of Kenton County, Kentucky Category:Rivers of Kentucky ","title":"Banklick Creek"},{"id":"7825709","text":"Petrolisthes elongatus, known as the New Zealand half crab, elongated porcelain crab, blue half crab, blue false crab or simply as the half crab or false crab, is a species of porcelain crab native to New Zealand. ==Description== The carapace is flattened with smooth side and rear margins, width is up to , and long whip-like antennae grow from the front corners, with the short rostrum extending beyond the large prominent eyes. The animal either filter feeds with long setae borne from the maxilliped palps, or scavenges by chopping up flesh with the second maxilliped and further shredding with the mandibles. The large chelipeds are generally smooth with no teeth or serrations, mainly used for territorial defense among males, who usually have one enlarged. Chelipeds and legs bear randomly located spines which can break off with wear, and these areas are dorsally coloured the same as the carapace, in black, blue, greenish or greyish, the ventral areas lighter. The last pair of legs are setose, reduced in size and carried folded under a large abdominal flap, which also allows the animal to swim backwards. Telson and uropods also setose. Studies in New Zealand from the 1960s and 1970s showed a difference in breeding biology from north to south, with ovigerous females found all year round in Auckland, and only in the summer months around Kaikoura.

This Pedro Mountain headland blocks the easy passage of coastal travelers between the Pedro Valley in Pacifica, California and Montara, California. The most prominent of these Pedro Mountain roads was Coastside Boulevard, the 1914 to 1937 coastal highway 57, which remains in use today as part of the trail network of McNee Ranch State Park. ==History== Pedro Mountain Road in 2007 The first historical record of the road crossing Pedro Mountain was in the journal of the Portola Expedition, October 1769. \\"...on a very bad road up over a high mountain...though easily climbed on the way up, had a very hard abrupt descent on the opposite side.\\" This routing today is known as Indian Trail, running up from Martini Creek, over Saddle Pass and down the ridge into the present day Willow Brook Estates in the Linda Mar district of Pacifica. From 1848 until 1879 the routing, known as Road Trail, was changed to run east and west along the ridge of Pedro Mountain from Saddle Pass turning north and descending the ridge above Adobe Drive and on towards the Sanchez Adobe. From 1879 to 1914 the routing was changed entirely, called the Half Moon Bay - Colma Road, and transversed over the mountain closer to the ocean on very steep and rutted switchbacks from above the Shamrock Ranch towards Martini Creek. The steepest sections of this routing were virtually impassible to automobiles, with a grading of 24%. The road was paved with concrete in 1913. From October 31, 1915 to June 1937 another new (paved) routing, called Coastside Boulevard (Highway 57) was routed up from Higgins Road in Pacifica, rising back towards Saddle Pass, and was welcomed as a much more automobile accessible routing. Remnants of this road are still passable to hikers, mountain bikers and horses and in the present day is called the 'Old Pedro Mountain Road'.VanderWerf, Barbara 1994. Montara Mountain. Gum Tree Lane Books, Granada, CA. Many cyclists have taken to unofficially calling it \`Planet of the Apes\`.https://www.strava.com/segments/3638392 ===Half Moon Bay - Colma Road=== It was a narrow, steep, and winding road and reportedly was seldom in good condition. Numerous accidents occurred on this dangerous road and some of the wrecked cars can still be found in ravines below the route. “Even with a thoroughly reliable driver and trustworthy car,” Motoring magazine warned in 1913, “Pedro Mountain Road is in such poor condition that anyone going this way is simply inviting disaster.” The danger was underscored by a large sign that read: “DANGEROUS FOR AUTOMOBILES—TAKE ROAD VIA SAN MATEO” Motorists who chose to ignore this sign encountered grades as steep as 25 percent in some places. Hairpin turns called for “the coolest heads, firmest hands, and strongest brakes that a car can have.”Half Moon Memories website This is supported by vintage photographs of the road. ===Ocean Shore Railroad=== The Ocean Shore Railroad, which operated from 1907 to 1920, served as an alternative routing to the nearly impassible Half Moon Bay-Colma road routing. After the railroad ceased operations along the coast, the company was unable to reach a satisfactory agreement with the State of California to move the highway to the railroad's right-of-way. Eventually, when State Route 1 was completed, the state located most of the highway parallel to the right-of-way, even along the treacherous Devil's Slide.Jack R. Wagner, The Last Whistle: Ocean Shore Railroad (Berkeley:Howell-North Books, 1974) ===Coastside Boulevard=== The Coastside Boulevard (also known as Highway 57) routing was replaced in 1937 by State Route 1 (the Cabrillo Highway), along the Devil's Slide.Rick Adams and Louise McCorkle, The State Route 1 Book, Ballantine Books, 1985 Portions of the crumbling pavement of Pedro Mountain Road can still be found between Montara and Pacifica. In some places, the roadbed has washed out or been partially buried by landslides. A short stub of the highway is still in use in Montara, near the local nursery. Nevertheless, the old routes are still accessible to hikers.Eyewitness account by Robert E. Nylund, www.mapquest.com One longtime coastside resident, Charlie Nye, Jr., recalled: \\"The road coming over Pedro Mountain was terrible, just awful. Words can’t describe it. It was just impossible. It went around turns and more turns, hairpin turns, short turns, backward turns. There were potholes on top of potholes. When you come down here today and complain about a few earth-slides on Devil’s Slide, well, that’s nothing compared to that old Pedro Mountain Road.\\"Interview with Charlie Nye Jr. for Half Moon Bay Memories website ==The road today== Part of the road begins at a chain link fence at the existing stub in Montara and continues north to Martini Creek.

The game was released on 26 November 2009 in Australia, 27 November in Europe, and 1 December in North America. In Rogue Warrior, the United States has sent in Richard Marcinko, a veteran U.S. Navy SEAL, on a mission into North Korea to disrupt ballistic missile launchers. The plot is not based on the autobiography by the game's protagonist, Richard Marcinko. Marcinko is voiced by actor Mickey Rourke. First announced in 2006, Rogue Warrior was originally being developed by Zombie Studios, and was set for a 2007 release. However, the game's release was delayed after Bethesda stated they were unsatisfied with the direction Zombie Studios was taking the game. Bethesda quickly scrapped the project and brought in Rebellion Development to develop an entire new game from scratch. Rebellion, while retaining some major elements from Zombie's rendition, has taken a whole new approach to the game and its focus. Rogue Warrior was universally panned by critics, who cited it as one of the worst games of all time. Criticism of the game included its poor controls, multiple glitches, outdated graphics, frequent profanity, rushed production, uninteresting gameplay, short length, very limited multiplayer, and broken and exploited combat techniques. ==Gameplay== Richard Marcinko using a kill move to eliminate an enemy. A third-person perspective is used when showing kill moves. Rogue Warrior is primarily a first-person shooter with tactical elements. The player assumes control of U.S. Navy SEAL Richard \\"Demo Dick\\" Marcinko, also known as \\"Rogue Warrior\\". The primary goal for Marcinko begins as an infiltration mission to disrupt hostile missiles and evolves to prevent other potentially dangerous situations. To achieve this goal, Marcinko may use a wide array of weapons and explosives. Such weapons include AK-47s, grenades, and combat knives. In addition to weapons, Marcinko may also utilize explosives barrels and gas tanks to eliminate enemies. The focus of gameplay is Marcinko's over-the-top methods and signature execution moves used in war situations. When the player is in close proximity of an enemy, they may press one of several buttons to trigger an instant kill via finishing moves, referred to as kill moves in the game. There are more than twenty-five finishing moves available to players. Such moves include throwing an enemy over a rail, slashing their throat, or stabbing them in the head. Upon initiating a finishing move, the in-game camera shifts to a third person cinematic angle to show the finishing animation. A cover system akin to Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas is incorporated. This allows the player to blind-fire and pop in-and-out of cover, but some positions of cover may be destroyed. There is also a \\"robust\\" checkpoint system that tracks player progress. ==Plot== In 1986, Richard Marcinko (voiced by Mickey Rourke), a U.S. Navy SEAL, is sent on a classified mission into Unggi, North Korea, with two other SEALs, to retrieve intelligence from a North Korean mole on ballistic missiles of an unfamiliar design that North Korea is supposedly in possession of, as well as to recon a factory that is allegedly developing the missiles. Shortly after touching ground, Marcinko's unit successfully takes out a Korean People's Army patrol, but one of the North Koreans suffers only wounds and manages to pull the pin of one of his grenades, killing Marcinko's team. Admiral Travis Payton (voiced by Neal McDonough), the commander of the operation, demands that Marcinko abort, but he refuses, saying he intends to finish the mission. After fighting through Unggi, Marcinko discovers the mole was killed. However, he finds the intel in the mole's apartment room on missile launchers that have been developed in Unggi. Marcinko is then ordered by Payton to disable the missile launchers by any means necessary. Marcinko enters the facility that is producing the missile launchers but finds that only one is present. According to intelligence received from Payton, the rest of the launchers are being moved out by sea. After destroying the missile, Marcinko heads to the Unggi harbor, and sees that they are actually being sent out of Unggi by train to the Soviet Union, not far from Unggi. Marcinko boards the train and destroys it as it crosses the border. Marcinko enters Soviet territory and gathers intelligence that the ballistic missiles were of Soviet origin, not North Korean. Marcinko also notices that the remaining ballistic missiles were moved out of North Korea to a palace in the Soviet Union. Marcinko insists on going after the missiles, but Payton warns that an attempt to go after the missiles will not only result in Marcinko's court-martial but even war between the United States and the Soviet Union. Marcinko dismisses these warnings and goes after the missiles. Marcinko enters the palace where the missiles are located. He contacts Payton, who threatens to have Marcinko court-martialed for disobeying orders. Marcinko suggests that he found proof that the Soviet Union created a missile defense program aimed to deter any U.S. nuclear launch against Soviet territory. This program was similar to the real-life U.S. Star Wars program aimed at deterring any Soviet missile attack on U.S. territory. Marcinko launches a missile at the palace, destroys the missiles located in a bunker under the palace, and escapes the palace. Marcinko then goes to a dam to disrupt electricity to a Soviet submarine base. Marcinko then heads to the submarine base with the purpose of destroying a submarine carrying the remaining missiles. Marcinko escapes onto a patrol boat with Navy SEALs aboard that were sent by Payton to help Marcinko. Marcinko hands over a computer chip to the commanding SEAL of the boat and tells him that it is evidence that justifies Marcinko's actions that is to be presented at his court-martial. ==Development== Announced in the fall of 2006 as a partnership between Bethesda Softworks and Zombie Studios, Rogue Warrior: Black Razor was billed as a tactical first-person shooter for release in 2007. Set in present-day North Korea, the plot focused on Marcinko and his team's effort to neutralize the country's nuclear launch capabilities. The game include drop-in four- player cooperative and 24-player competitive multiplayer, with the latter featuring a unique map system where each team would select the layout of their territory, and the center area of the map would be randomized. In 2009, the game resurfaced after much silence. Bethesda publicly stated that they were not satisfied with the direction Zombie was taking the game. Bethesda scrapped the project and commissioned Rebellion Developments to develop the game. Starting fresh, Rebellion made numerous changes to the gameplay, plot, and features. The setting shifted to 1986 Soviet Union and North Korea; the game engine became proprietary; the cooperative play was struck along with the multiplayer tiling system; the overall focus turned to Marcinko's personality and kill moves; and the name was shortened to simply Rogue Warrior. Mickey Rourke was also announced as the celebrity voice actor of Marcinko. On 6 September, video game website GameSpot posted the game's first preview after the game had been reconstructed. ==Reception== Rogue Warrior received \\"unfavorable\\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameSpot said of the PC and Xbox 360 versions, \\"This dreadfully boring, expletive-filled, extremely short shooter is an absolute rip-off.\\" IGN said that the gameplay is poorly done. GameZone's Natalie Romano said of the Xbox 360 version, \\"A very disappointing game from start to finish, Rogue Warrior is a game that brings nothing new to the genre nor does it make for a fun first-person shooter worth the money. Simply put, this isn’t just an awful shooter but it’s also a terrible game. Sorry, but this is one hero we would like to leave behind.\\" Andrew Reiner of Game Informer concluded that \\"with the gunplay being as bad as it is, and the story coming across as a six- year-old’s interpretation of Cold War events, the only fun comes from the possibility of stepping into the shoes of a blatantly homoerotic Rambo\\". ==See also== * List of video games notable for negative reception ==ReferencesGamasutra Interview Rebellion's Guy Category:2009 video games Category:Bethesda Softworks games Category:First-person shooters Category:Games for Windows certified games Category:Multiplayer and single- player video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Rebellion Developments games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games set in 1986 Category:Alternate history video games Category:Video games set in North Korea Category:Video games set in the Soviet Union Category:Cold War video games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Stealth video games ","title":"Rogue Warrior (video game)"},{"id":"7825934","text":"BrightPoint, Inc. was a provider of \\"wireless device lifecycle services\\", specializing in the distribution of wireless devices and in providing customized logistics services to the wireless industry.

Atco Records released it as a single in March 1957, which topped the R&B; Chart for twelve weeks. It also reached number three on the Billboard singles chart. Although the Coasters had previously done well on the R&B; charts, it was \\"Searchin'\\" (along with \\"Young Blood\\" on the flip side) that sparked the group's rock and roll fame. ==Composition== The lyrics, written by Leiber, use vernacular phrasing. The plot revolves around the singer's determination to find his love wherever she may be, even if he must resort to detective work. The song's notable gimmick was in citing specific law-enforcement figures from popular culture, such as Sherlock Holmes, Charlie Chan, Joe Friday, Sam Spade, Boston Blackie, Bulldog Drummond, and the North- West Mounted Police (the Mounties). The vocals of the Coasters' lead singer Billy Guy are raw and insistent. Driving the song is a pounding piano rhythm of two bass notes alternating on every second beat. The theme of the song is searching for love: \\"Well, I'm searching, Yeah I'm gonna find her\\". The refrain is simple variations of this phrase, \\"Gonna find her, yeah ah, gonna find her\\". The song was recorded in Los Angeles on February 15, 1957; the backing band included Mike Stoller (piano and arrangement), Barney Kessell (guitar), Ralph Harrison (bass), and Jesse Sailes (drums).Peter Grendysa and Robert Pruter, Atlantic Rhythm and Blues 1947-1974 booklet notes (CD edition), Atlantic Records, 1991 ==Other versions== Johnny Rivers released a version of the song as a medley with \\"So Fine\\" which reached number 113 on the U.S. pop chart in 1973. Singer/songwriter Paul McCartney chose \\"Searchin'\\" as one of his Desert Island Discs in 1982. McCartney performed the song with the Beatles during their audition for Decca Records on January 1, 1962 (with somewhat mangled lyrics that included a mention of Peter Gunn). ==References== Category:Songs written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller Category:1957 singles Category:The Coasters songs Category:The Beatles songs Category:The Hollies songs Category:The Spencer Davis Group songs Category:Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip- Hop Songs number-one singles Category:Atco Records singles ","title":"Searchin'"},{"id":"7825995","text":"Ellingboe is the surname of the following people: * Bradley Ellingboe (born 1958), American composer * Jules Ellingboe (1892–1948), American racecar driver ","title":"Ellingboe"},{"id":"7826010","text":"John \\"Shôn\\" Eirwyn Ffowcs Williams, (born 25 May 1935) is Emeritus Rank Professor of Engineering at the University of Cambridge and a former Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge (1996–2002). He may be best known for his contributions to Aeroacoustics, in particular for his work on Concorde. Together with one of his students, David Hawkings, he introduced the far-field integration method in computational aeroacoustics based on Lighthill's acoustic analogy, known as the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings analogy. ==Education and early life== Born in Wales in 1935, Ffowcs-Williams was educated at the Great Ayton Friends' School and Derby Technical College (now part of the University of Derby). He served an engineering apprenticeship with Rolls-Royce before going to the University of Southampton, he always maintained a strong commitment to bring academic research to bear on industrial problems. He was awarded Bachelor of Science degree and a PhD from the University of Southampton in 1961. ==Career and research== He cofounded Topexpress Ltd, a consultancy company in Cambridge specialising in engineering science, was executive consultant to Rolls Royce and a director of VSEL plc. For 25 years he led the division in which The University Cambridge's Fluid Mechanics, Aeronautics, Thermodynamics, and Turbomachinery work is concentrated. He was admitted to his Professorial Fellowship at Emmanuel in 1973; he was the longest-serving professor in the University when he retired from his chair in 2002. He taught engineering for the College but, before becoming Master his main College contribution was serving on the Governing Body and its committees. He was the first holder of the Rank Chair of engineering established in 1972 in the field of Acoustics, coming to Cambridge from Imperial College London, where he held the Rolls-Royce Chair in theoretical Acoustics. His speciality was noise and vibration caused by unsteady flow. His main achievement was to persuade very good research students to tackle important but interesting problems which ranged from the aeroacoustics of supersonic flight, to the quietening of underwater platforms. His work helped make anti-sound useful for noise control and for stabilising unstable aeromechanical systems. His doctoral students include David Crighton, Steve Furber, and Ann Dowling. ===Awards and honours=== Ffowcs-Williams was award an Honorary Doctor of Science (DSc) from the University of Southampton and Master of Arts and Doctor of Science (ScD) degrees from the University of Cambridge. * He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng) in 1988 * In 1984 he was awarded the Rayleigh Medal by the UK Institute of Acoustics. * In 1989 he was awarded the Médaille Étrangère by the French Acoustic Society (SFA). * For his contributions to the foundations and applications of Aeroacoustics, which have enabled dramatic reductions in the noise of aircraft and submarines he was awarded the Sir Frank Whittle Medal by the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2002. * He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society (FRAeS) * He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA) * He was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Physics (FinstP) ==References== Category:1935 births Category:Academics of Imperial College London Category:Living people Category:Masters of Emmanuel College, Cambridge Category:Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering Category:Fellows of the Institute of Physics Category:Fellows of the Royal Aeronautical Society Category:Welsh engineers Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:20th-century British engineers Category:21st-century British engineers Category:Fluid dynamicists ","title":"John Ffowcs Williams"},{"id":"7826014","text":"Wildflowers is a 1999 drama film directed by Melissa Painter and starring Clea DuVall, Daryl Hannah, Tomas Arana and Eric Roberts.

As the Rio Grande formed the international border, the tract was unambiguously American territory. In July 1906, however, the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company dug a cutoff to shorten the course of the river, thus bypassing the tract. As a result, the of the tract (including the former riverbed) became located south of the river. The company was eventually taken to court and fined for the diversion of the river, and the land was agreed to remain American territory, in accordance with the border treaty. In 1929 the town of Río Rico was founded near the tract on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande.Matter of Cantu 17 Immigration & Naturalization Dec. 190, 190-91 (BIA, 1978) As the Rio Grande changed its course after floods, the settlement was progressively pushed into the tract. The residents, being mostly of Mexican heritage, accepted the authority of the Mexican government and all parties generally acted as if the tract was Mexican territory. However, the United States never actually relinquished the land, and the issue was re-discovered decades later by a researcher. The Boundary Treaty of 1970 provided for the Horcón Tract to revert to Mexico upon the completion of two new flood control projects. Thus in 1972 the United States officially ceded the tract of land to Mexico. The Board of Immigration Appeals later determined that persons born in the Horcón Tract between 1906 and 1972 could not be deported, effectively if not technically granting citizenship.Matter of Cantu, 17 Immigration & Naturalization Dec. 190, 194 (BIA 1978)(\\"Either the Government has established, ... that the respondent is an alien, or it has not; if it has not, it is not incumbent upon this Board to go the additional step of determining whether he is also a citizen.

Providing performing music and drama courses, the institution became renowned partly because of the international reputation of its successive directors such as François-Joseph Fétis, François-Auguste Gevaert, Edgar Tinel, Joseph Jongen or Marcel Poot, but more because it has been attended by many of the top musicians, actors and artists in Belgium such as Arthur Grumiaux, José Van Dam, Sigiswald Kuijken, Josse De Pauw, Luk van Mello and Luk De Konink. Adolphe Sax, inventor of the saxophone, also studied at the Brussels Conservatory. In 1967, the institution split into two separate entities: the Koninklijk Conservatorium Brussel, which teaches in Dutch, and the Conservatoire Royal de Bruxelles, which continued teaching in French. The former entity became a School of Arts of Erasmus University College alongside film school RITCS, and associated with Vrije Universiteit Brussel it also offers Ph.D. degrees in the Arts through Art Platform Brussels.

The style is neo-Renaissance, influenced by the Lescot Wing of the Louvre. The decorative program of the facade is very elaborate, with five separate pediment sculptures (Instrumental Music by Liège sculptor Adolphe Fassin, Orchestration by Charles van der Stappen, Composition by Antwerp sculptor Frans Deckers, Performing Arts by Antoine-Félix Bouré, and Poetry by Tournai sculptor Barthélemy Frison) and other incidental work including garlands, caryatids, palm trees and musical instruments by sculptors Georges Houtstont, Paul de Vigne, Antoine-Joseph Van Rasbourgh, Auguste Braekevelt, and Égide Mélot. == Auxiliary activities == === Concerts === Each year a variety of regular student concerts and performances is organised by the Conservatory, boasting over hundred events and enhanced by two festivals. The right wing of the Conservatory contains a 600 seats ornate concert hall in Napoleon-III style with exceptional acoustic qualities, equipped with a Cavaillé-Coll organ. Concert hall of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels (Library of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels, B-Bc, SLZ) === Musical Instrument Museum (MIM) === Founded in 1877 to provide students with a practical education about ancien instruments, the Conservatory museum, currently referred to as the Musical Instrument Museum (MIM) of Brussels displays over 8.000 ancient instruments acquired by Fétis, rare pieces from the initial collection, from the various funds or from new acquisitions. Since 2000, the museum, one of the most important ones of its kind, is located in the prestigious Art Nouveau building conceived in 1899 by the Belgian architect Paul Saintenoy for Old England. === Library === Initially created with a pedagogic aim, the Conservatory library hosts about 250.000 references, representing a scientific instrument of international resonance. 350x350px It primarily consists of works about music (including more than 1200 musical or musicological periodicals), as well as of autograph, printed or digitized (scanned) scores. There is also an important collection of more than 8.000 libretti of Italian, French or German operas from the XVIIe and XVIIIe s., lute and guitar tablatures, several thousands of handwritten letters of musicians, iconographic documents (over 9.000 pieces), concert programmes and various types of recordings (magnetic tapes, video, 78 and 33 rpm vinyl, CD, etc.). Next to the core collections, the library possesses several subcollections of historical importance, together forming an extensive patrimony: * the Johann J.H. Westphal collection bought by Fétis (manuscripts of C.P.E. Bach and G.P. Telemann), * the Richard Wagener collection acquired by the librarian Alfred Wotquenne (German music from the XVIIe, XVIIIe and XIXe s. including 40 autograph manuscripts from three sons of J.-S. Bach), * the Jean-Lucien Hollenfeltz collection (documents of Constance Mozart and her youngest son Franz Xaver Amadeus Mozart), * the Maria Malibran collection (documents and objects from the cantatrice and her close family), * the Edmond Michotte collection (pieces from Rossini's private library), * the Józef Wieniawski collection (autograph scores from the pianist), * the Laurent Halleux collection, * the Joseph Jongen collection. The library is open to the general public. In 2015, the library acquired the score collection of CeBeDeM (Belgian Centre for Music Documentation). In doing so it also took over the latter's objectives in promoting Belgian contemporary music worldwide. == Personalities linked to the Royal Conservatory of Brussels == François-Auguste Fétis, first director of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels === Directors === * 1833-1871: François-Joseph Fétis * 1871–1908: François-Auguste Gevaert * 1908–1912: Edgar Tinel * 1912–1925: Léon Du Bois * 1925–1939: Joseph Jongen * 1939–1949: Léon Jongen * 1949–1966: Marcel Poot ==== Directors of the Conservatoire Royal de Bruxelles ==== * 1966–1973: Camille Schmit (in French) * 1974–1987: Éric Feldbusch (in French) * 1987–2002: Jean Baily (in French) * 2003–present: Frédéric de Roos ==== Directors of the Koninklijk Conservatorium Brussel ==== * 1966-1994: Kamiel D'Hooghe (in Dutch) * 1994-2004: Arie Van Lysebeth (in Dutch) * 2004-2008: Rafael D'Haene * 2008–2017: Peter Swinnen * 2017–present: Kathleen Coessens === Notable faculty === * Daniel Blumenthal (piano) * Boyan Vodenitcharov (piano) * Igor Oistrach (violin) * Barthold Kuijken (baroque) * Katarina Glowicka, computer music * Luc Devos (piano) * Jan Michiels (piano) * Lola Bobesco (violin) * Yossif Ivanov (violin) * Adrien François Servais (cello) * Paul Dombrecht (hobo) * Philippe Pierlot (baroque) * Norbert Nozy (brass band) * André Souris (direction, composition) * Jacques Leduc (direction, composition) * Charles-Auguste de Bériot, violin * François Daneels, saxophone * Bernard Foccroule, organ * Julien Ghyoros, direction * Jacques-Nicolas Lemmens, organ * Jean Louël, piano * Marie Pleyel, piano * Eliane Reyes, piano * Adolphe Samuel, composition * Henri Vieuxtemps, violin * Henryk Wieniawski, violin * Eugène Ysaÿe, violin * Zygmund Kowalsky (violin) * Yuzuko Horigome (violin) * Valery Oistrach (violin) * Viviane Spanoghe (chamber music) * Erik Robberecht (chamber music) * Alain Gervreau (baroque) * François Fernandez (baroque) * Bart Coen (baroque) * Bruno Castellucci, jazz percussion * Ernest Van Dijck, lyrical art * Annelies Van Parys, form analysis * Jules Zarembski, piano * Philippe Graffin, violin ===Notable alumni=== * Elie Apper * Isaac Albéniz * Peter Benoit * Oskar Back * Fabrizio Cassol * Claire Chevallier * Alain Crépin * François Daneels * John Giordano * Edwin Grasse * Mansoor Hosseini * Désiré Magnus * Alma Moodie * Norbert H.

His attack \\"ignited controversy of a scale, visibility, and ferocity never before seen in anthropology.\\" Freeman initially became interested in Boasian cultural anthropology while an undergraduate in Wellington, and later went to live and work as a teacher in Samoa. After entering the New Zealand Naval Reserve in World War II, he did graduate training with British social anthropologists Meyer Fortes and Raymond Firth at London School of Economics. He did two and a half years of fieldwork in Borneo studying the Iban people. His 1953 doctoral dissertation described the relations between Iban agriculture and kinship practices. Returning to Borneo in 1961 he suffered a nervous breakdown induced by an intense rivalry with ethnologist and explorer Tom Harrisson. This experience profoundly altered his view of anthropology, changing his interests to looking at the ways in which human behavior is influenced by universal psychological and biological foundations. From then on Freeman argued strongly for a new approach to anthropology which integrated insights from evolutionary theory and psychoanalysis, and he published works on the concepts of aggression and choice. This new interest in biological and psychological universals led him to take issue with the famous American anthropologist Margaret Mead who had described Samoan adolescents as not suffering from the \\"coming of age\\" crisis which was commonly thought to be universal when the study was published in 1923. Mead argued that the lack of this crisis in Samoan adolescence was caused by the youths' greater degree of sexual freedom, and that adolescence crises were therefore not universal, but culturally conditioned. In 1966-67 Freeman conducted fieldwork in Samoa, trying to find Mead's original informants, and while visiting the community where Mead had worked he experienced another breakdown. In 1983 Freeman published his book Margaret Mead and Samoa: The Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth in which he argued that Mead's data and conclusions were wrong and that Samoan youths suffered from the same problems as Western adolescents. He also argued that Samoan culture in fact put greater emphasis on female virginity than Western culture and had higher indices of juvenile delinquency, sexual violence and suicide. He later published The Fateful Hoaxing of Margaret Mead, in which he argued that Mead's misunderstandings of Samoan culture were due to her having been hoaxed by two of her female Samoan informants, who had merely joked about sexual escapades that they did not in fact have. Freeman's critique of Mead sparked intense debate and controversy in the discipline of anthropology, as well as in the general public. Many of Freeman's critics argued that he misrepresented Mead's views and ignored changes in Samoan society that had taken place in the period between Mead's work in 1925-1926 and his own from 1941 to 1943, including an increasing influence of Christianity. Several Samoan scholars who had been discontented with Mead's depiction of them as happy and sexually liberated thought that Freeman erred in the opposite direction. But Freeman's arguments were embraced enthusiastically among scholars who argue for the existence of genetically-hardwired universal behaviors and prefer such fields as sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.The debate made Freeman a celebrity both inside and outside of anthropology, to an extent that in 1996 Freeman's life became the topic of the play Heretic written by Australian playwright David Williamson, which opened in the Sydney Opera House. The so-called Mead-Freeman controversy spanned three decades, and Freeman published his last rebuttal of a critique of his arguments only weeks before his death in 2001. ==Life== Freeman was raised in Wellington by an Australian father and a New Zealand mother who had been reared in Presbyterian tradition. In particular, Freeman's mother took an active interest in his education and he maintained a close relationship with her during his adult life. ===Early studies=== In 1934 he entered Wellington's Victoria University College as an undergraduate and studied psychology and philosophy with Siegfried Frederick Nadel. Freeman later commented that if anthropology had been offered he would likely have chosen to study that. He also studied education and was issued a teacher's certificate in 1937. In 1938 he attended a graduate seminar taught by Ernest Beaglehole, who in turn had been a student of Edward Sapir. Beaglehole encouraged Freeman's interest in Mead's groundbreaking 1928 work, and this sparked his interest in visiting Samoa.Freeman 1983, Preface, page xiii. During his undergraduate studies in psychology he studied the socialization of children aged 6 to 9 in Wellington. This research led him to take a strong cultural determinist stance, even publishing an article in the student publication \\"Salient\\" stating that \\"the aims and desire which determine behavior are all constituted by the social environment\\". Also during this period he met Jiddu Krishnamurti who instilled in Freeman an interest in free will and choice as a counterpoint to the forces of social and cultural conditioning. ===In Samoa=== Three Samoan girls photographed in 1902 forty years before Freeman's arrival in Samoa In 1940 Freeman's desire to travel Samoa was realized when he took a position as a schoolteacher in Samoa, from April 1940 to November 1943, during which time he learned to speak the Samoan language fluently, being qualified by a government examination. And he was adopted into a Samoan family of the community of Sa'anapu, and received the chiefly title of Logona-i-Taga. He also made archaeological field studies around the island of Upolu including the Falemauga Caves and earth mounds in Vailele village. Even though he was working as a teacher, he also had time to undertake studies of socialization in children of the same age group with which he had worked in New Zealand. Freeman also collected Samoan artefacts of material culture, which was later deposited in the Otago Museum of Dunedin, New Zealand of which he was made an honorary curator of ethnology. Having served in the Samoan defence force since 1941, in 1943, Freeman left Samoa to enlist in the Royal New Zealand Naval Volunteer Reserve. He served in Europe and the far east during the war, and in September and October 1945 while his ship was accepting the surrender of Japanese troops in Borneo, Freeman came into contact with the Iban people. This experience inspired him to return to do fieldwork in Sarawak. ===Doctoral research in Borneo=== In 1946 he received a Rehabilitation Bursary of the New Zealand government, he did two years of post-graduate studies with Raymond Firth at the London School of Economics and Political Science. During 1946-48 his research centered on manuscript sources relating to Samoa in the archives of the London Missionary Society. In 1947 he gave a lecture series at Oxford University on Samoan social structure, this brought him into contact with Meyer Fortes who became a significant influence on his doctoral research. In November 1948, he married Monica Maitland, and shortly after the couple left for Sarawak where Freeman would spend the next 30 months doing fieldwork among the Iban for his doctoral dissertation. In Borneo, Freeman collaborated closely with his wife, an artist, who made many ethnographic drawings of the Iban.Freeman, Monica. 2009. The Iban Diaries of Monica Freeman 1949-1951, Including Ethnographic Drawings, Sketches, Paintings, Photographs and Letters. Laura P. Appell-Warren, (Editor) Monograph 11 of Borneo Research Council Freeman returned to England in 1951 and was accepted into King's College at the University of Cambridge, where he completed his doctoral thesis on the Iban in 1953. His thesis about Iban agriculture has been described as \\"a superb piece of research\\" and \\"one of the best and most complete accounts of swidden agriculture that has yet been made\\" It was pioneering in utilizing quantitative data to illuminate aspects of swidden economy as well as social organization. He also described the Iban kinship system which was remarkable in being neither patrilineal or matrilineal, but allowing either kind of filiation (but not both) for any individual. Freeman described this system as \\"utrolineal\\", and personal choice inherent in the system underpinned much of Freeman's later work. He subsequently taught at the University of Otago in New Zealand, and the University of Samoa. In 1955, he became Senior Fellow in the Research School of Pacific Studies at Australian National University in Canberra, where he stayed until his death. ===Kinship studies and changing heart=== In the next decades Freeman worked on kinship, exploring especially the system of cognatic descent, in several important papers, such as Freeman (1957) and (1961). Up until this point Freeman had been trained in a framework of British social anthropology and identified strongly with American, Boasian cultural anthropology, but from 1960 he grew increasingly dissatisfied with that paradigm, partly because he felt that it left him unable to answer several important questions regarding Iban ritual behavior. Freeman later described how this dissatisfaction culminated when he read a passage in Victor Turner's \\"Symbols in Ndembu ritual\\", which questioned the ability of anthropologists to form adequate opinions about psychological aspects of ritual behavior. ===Conversion and breakdown in Kuching=== The Old Sarawak Museum in Kuching, where Freeman destroyed an Iban carved statue. An important event in Freeman's life and career took place in 1961 when Freeman was sent to Borneo to attend to a graduate student, one Brian de Martinoir, who had run into trouble with locals while studying in central Borneo. The student (who was later described by Freeman as an impostor with fake credentials) had been subject to verbal abuse and humiliation by Tom Harrisson, Government Ethnologist and Curator of the Sarawak Museum, and this event had threatened his relationship with the Kajang people that he was studying. Freeman knew Harrisson, from his earlier work in Borneo in 1957 when Freeman had himself once been subject to Harrisson's fiery temper - the two men both had strong personalities and they were both strongly territorial about their research subjects. During the stay in Kuching, Freeman developed an intense antagonism towards Harrisson, whom he believed to be a corrupting influence on the local indigenous people, and in spite of his orders from the Australian National University to leave Harrisson be, he worked intensely to put him in a bad light with the local government, and to have him forcibly removed from Borneo. Freeman seems to have believed that through erotic statues elaborated by the local Iban and working in concert with agents of the Soviet Union to subvert the British rule of Malaysia, Harrisson was exerting a form of mind control over Freeman himself as well as over the officials of Borneo. The conflict culminated when Freeman broke into Harrisson's house while he was out, and smashed a carved wooden sculpture at the Sarawak museum. Doubting his own mental health Freeman left Borneo for England intent to see a friend who was a psychiatrist, but during a stop-over in Karachi where he met with officials from London, he decided instead to return to Canberra. At Canberra Freeman was talked into seeing a psychiatrist by the university, agreeing on the condition that the topic of conversation would be Harrisson's madness and not his own mental state. When the psychiatrist Dr. Tenthowathan evaluated him as being emotionally unstable, Freeman was incredibly offended and wrote a report denouncing the doctor as an incompetent. While there were always speculations and divided opinions about Freeman's mental health among his friends and colleagues, Freeman himself rejected such speculations entirely, stating that he was in full control of himself throughout the events in Kuching. Freeman himself described the events in Kuching as a \\"conversion\\" and an \\"abreaction\\" through which he acquired a new level of awareness, including the sudden realization that most of the basic assumptions of cultural anthropology were inadequate. From then on he adopted a new, less culturalistic and more naturalistic scientific stance, incorporating elements of ethology, primatology, neuroscience, psychology and evolutionary theory. He also changed the name under which he published; until that point he had published as J. D. Freeman, but from then on he published as Derek Freeman. ===Freeman and Mead in Canberra=== Margaret Mead, whose conclusions regarding female sexuality in Samoa Freeman sought to refute. The events also affected Freeman's career by making the Malaysian government declare him persona non grata in Borneo, the place which had been his primary research site. Freeman then traveled to Europe to study psychoanalysis for two years. He contacted Margaret Mead, asking her to introduce him to the American psychoanalytic milieu, which she reluctantly did. Mead knew at that point that Freeman had privately criticized her work in Samoa, and also had heard of his reputation for being difficult to deal with. In November 1964 Mead visited the Australian National University and she and Freeman had their only meeting. Freeman privately presented Mead with most of the critique of her work that he would later publish after her death, and at a public meeting they had a heated discussion about the importance of female virginity in Samoan culture. During this meeting Freeman made a peculiar faux pas. When Mead asked why he had not brought his undergraduate thesis on Samoan social structure to her residence the night before, he replied \\"because I was afraid you might ask me to stay the night\\". Mead was by then more than 60 years old and walked with a cane, and the suggestion that Freeman thought Mead might seduce him caused hilarity in the auditorium. Freeman later commented that he had no idea why he said what he did, and that he was himself mortified at hearing his own words. This slip and subsequent events in Samoa, have been used to argue that Freeman's academic relationship with Margaret Mead was complicated by Freeman's emotions. Freeman later admitted that he did feel intimidated by Mead even as he was administering his harsh verbal critique of her work, and he described her as a \\"castrator of men\\" to whose power he did not want to succumb. ===Back to Samoa=== In December 1965, Freeman returned to Samoa, staying there the next two years. Originally his research was supposed to focus on social change, especially interactions between demographic and environmental processes, and he intended to base his research in ethological and psychoanalytic theory. However, traveling to Samoa Freeman decided that his objective should rather be to refute Mead's studies of Samoan sexuality. After working for a while in Western Samoa where he had most of his connections, he traveled to Ta‘ū in American Samoa, the location of Mead's fieldwork in the 1920s, hoping to find some of her original informants. He did not find any, but he did interview several Chiefs who had known Mead and who were highly critical of her depictions of Samoan society. He was also told that Mead had had an affair with a Samoan man, and the men he interviewed expressed outrage at her sexual licentiousness. This information deeply impacted Freeman, who later described the discovery as deeply upsetting. He concluded that when Mead described Young Samoan women as sexually liberated she was in fact projecting onto them \\"her own sexual experiences as a young woman in the faraway, romantic south seas\\". Shortly after uncovering this information Freeman suffered another breakdown, his Samoan hosts found him wandering the beach in an agitated state. Due to his \\"verbally violent\\" behavior, the coast guard was dispatched to bring him to observation at the local hospital. Samoan witnesses ascribed the incident to spirit possession, some Americans thought of it as evidence of psychological problems, but Freeman himself dismissed those speculations attributing it to fatigue from research and possible symptoms of dengue fever. ===The beginnings of controversy=== Back from Samoa in 1968 Freeman gave a paper criticizing Mead to the Australian Association of Social Anthropology. The paper contained many of the arguments later to be published in \\"Margaret Mead and Samoa\\": Freeman argued that Mead had been influenced by her strongly held belief in the power of culture as a determinant of human behavior, and that this belief had caused her to mischaracterize Samoa as a sexually liberated society when in fact it was characterized by sexual repression and violence and adolescent delinquency. In 1972 he published a note in the Journal of the Polynesian Society criticizing Mead's spelling of Polynesian words suggesting that her non-standard orthography betrayed a general lack of skills in the Samoan language. Completing his manuscript of Margaret Mead and Samoa in 1977 he wrote Mead offering her to read it before publication, but Mead was by then seriously ill with cancer and was unable to respond - she died the next year. Freeman sent the manuscript first to the University of Oxford Press for publication, but the editor requested several revisions which Freeman rejected. In 1982 the manuscript was accepted for publication by the Australian National University Press, which issued the work in 1983. In 1979 Freeman also sparked a public controversy in Canberra when he protested against the Mexican government's gift of a copy of the Aztec calendar stone to the Australian National University. Freeman believed the stone to have been an altar used for human sacrifice, and therefore saw it as being inappropriate. Freeman stated that the Aztecs were \\"the most barbaric culture in all of human history\\". The event caused public debate, with commentators accusing Freeman of exhibiting a double standard as he did not speak out against a model of the Roman Colosseum on the campus, and that he had never spoken similarly out against practices of human sacrifice and cannibalism amongst the Bornean and Samoan people he had studied. The controversy created an urban legend in Australia that Freeman had either doused the stone with blood in a display of protest, or that he had planned to do so - these stories are however incorrect, and Freeman in fact calmly attended the inauguration of the stone. ===Freeman vs. Mead: A self described heresy=== Freeman's research on Samoa was conducted over 4 decades, and crystallized in 1981 when he was finally granted access to the archives of the High Court of American Samoa for the period of the 1920s;Freeman 1983, Preface, page xvi. consequently, his refutation was published only after Mead's death in 1978. Freeman says that he informed Mead of his ongoing work in refuting her research when he met her in person in November 1964 and engaged in correspondence with her;Library of Congress, \\"Mead Responds to Freeman.\\" nevertheless, he has come under fire for not publishing his work at a time when Mead could reply to his accusations.\\"Misguided Views from Defenders of the Clever Country\\" by Ron Brunton, The Courier-Mail, 21 July 2001. However, when Freeman died in 2001, his obituary in The New York Times pointed out that Freeman tried to publish his criticism of Mead as early as 1971, but American publishers had rejected his manuscript. In 1978, Freeman sent a revised manuscript to Mead, but she was ill and died a few months later without responding. The publication of Margaret Mead in Samoa: the Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth sparked an intense controversy both within anthropology and in the general public. The debate which has been characterized as being \\"of a scale, visibility, and ferocity never before seen in anthropology,\\" lasted for more than a quarter of a century and has not yet died out. Dozens of articles and many monograph books have been published analyzing the arguments and the debate itself. In the 1983 book Freeman described incongruities between Mead's published research and his observations of Samoans: Freeman's 1983 critique asserts that Mead was tricked by native informants who were lying to herMcCall, page 1. and that these misconceptions reinforced Mead's doctrine of \\"absolute cultural determinism\\" that entirely neglects the role of biology and evolution in human behavior, concentrating instead on the cultural influences.Shankman, page 539. Freeman also argues that \\"Mead ignored violence in Samoan life, did not have a sufficient background in—or give enough emphasis to—the influence of biology on behavior, did not spend enough time in Samoa, and was not familiar enough with the Samoan language.\\"Library of Congress, \\"Afterward: Derek Freeman and Margaret Mead.\\" Freeman's refutation was initially met by some with accusations of \\"circumstantial evidence, selective quotation, omission of inconvenient evidence, spurious historical tracking and other critical observations,\\" resulting in \\"major questions\\" about the validity and honesty of his scholarship. In 1996 Martin Orans examined Mead's notes preserved at the Library of Congress, and credits her for leaving all of her recorded data available to the general public. Orans concludes that Freeman's basic criticisms, that Mead was duped by ceremonial virgin Fa'apua'a Fa'amu (who later swore to Freeman that she had played a joke on Mead) was wrong for several reasons: first, Mead was well aware of the forms and frequency of Samoan joking; second, she provided a careful account of the sexual restrictions on ceremonial virgins that corresponds to Fa'apua'a Fa'auma'a's account to Freeman, and third, that Mead's notes make clear that she had reached her conclusions about Samoan sexuality before meeting Fa'aupa'a Fa'amu. He therefore concludes, contrary to Freeman, that Mead was never the victim of a hoax. Orans argues that Mead's data supports several different conclusions (Orans argues that Mead's own data portrays Samoa as more sexually restrictive than the popular image), and that Mead's conclusions hinge on an interpretive, rather than positivist, approach to culture.Orans, Martin 1996 Not Even Wrong: Margaret Mead, Derek Freeman, and the Samoans. Freeman's obituary in The New York Times stated that \\"His challenge was initially greeted with disbelief or anger, but gradually won wide -- although not complete -- acceptance,\\" but further said that \\"many anthropologists have agreed to disagree over the findings of one of the science's founding mothers, acknowledging both Mead's pioneering research and the fact that she may have been mistaken on details.\\" Soon after, The New York Times published the following response from Professor Louise Lamphere, president of the American Anthropological Association, :Your 5 Aug. obituary of the anthropologist Derek Freeman leaves the impression that the two books he wrote attacking Margaret Mead's work have permanently damaged her reputation. The Freeman debate has been the subject of a number of books and scholarly articles that support her views on the importance of culture for the adolescent experience, while criticizing some details of her research. :I have taught about the controversy for the last 18 years and am still impressed by the fact that a 24-year-old woman could produce a study so far ahead of its time. Dr. Freeman studied a different island 20 years after Mead's research, and his notion that biology is more determinative than culture is oversimplified. Most serious scholarship casts grave doubt on his data and theory. A detailed review of the controversy by Paul Shankman, published by the University of Wisconsin Press in 2009, supports the contention that Mead's research was essentially correct, and concludes that Freeman cherry-picked his data and misrepresented both Mead and Samoan culture. ===Death=== Freeman died of congestive heart failure in 2001 at the age of eighty-four. His private book collection, which has been described as one of a number of \\"major Canberra personal libraries\\",Colin Steele, \\"Charles Stitz adds to our book history\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 26 June 2014. was dispersed after his death. ==Selected works== ===Books and theses=== * 1953 Family and Kin among the Iban of Sarawak.

It is occasionally known as the \\"second coronation concerto\\" on account of Mozart playing it on the occasion of the coronation of Leopold II in Frankfurt am Main in October 1790. The autograph is held by the Jagiellońska Library, Kraków. The first edition was produced by Johann Andre of Offenbach in 1794, and Breitkopf & Härtel produced an edition in 1800. Like most of Mozart's concertos it is in three movements: # Allegro # Allegretto in C major # Allegro assai The concerto was written for Mozart to perform himself: Hutchings calls it \\"athletic\\", combining grace with vigour. It is scored for flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, and strings. == First movement == The first movement is in cut time, and it is the only first movement of a piano concerto by Mozart to be written in cut time. The orchestra opens quietly with a prelude of 71 bars (Hutchings incorrectly states 72), wherein six orchestral themes are exposed (A-F in Hutchings' notation; see main article on Mozart Piano Concertos for a discussion of this notation), of which the first, rhythmical and with a military ambiance, becomes increasingly important as the movement progresses; indeed, its insistent rhythm dominates the entire movement. The piano then answers with its own exposition of 116 bars, starting with A and B, then introducing some new material (themes x and y), with free passages of arpeggios and scales: the scheme is ABxAyA Free D Free. The orchestra then returns on its own with its short first ritornello (22 bars) that introduces another theme, G: the scheme is AGAG. In the ensuing middle section (35 bars) yet another orchestral theme is introduced, H: the scheme is HAHAHA. This is followed by a long recapitulation, also of 116 bars, where, as is typical of his concertos, Mozart rapidly departs from a simple repetition of the previous material: the scheme is ABAyADA Free. Finally, the movement is brought to a close with the final ritornello (36 bars): AGA Cadenza (Mozart's own exists) EF - hence the two closing themes of the prelude are finally heard again at the end. === Analysis === The analysis is based on, and expanded from the scheme of Hutchings, by reference to the score. Girdlestone's implied scheme differs somewhat (for example, he recognises seven themes in the prelude: the extra one is identified as the \\"subsidiary theme\\" below). ==== Prelude (orchestra) ==== Bars: 1-16 A (2 x 8 bars, first p then f) 16-24 B 24-36 C plus short passage (32-36) connecting to D (this reoccurs constantly with D and thus could be considered part of it) 37-54 D (37-42), plus subsidiary theme linking to E 54-62 E -first closing theme 62-71 F -second closing theme ==== Exposition ==== 72-79 A (piano) 79-87 A (piano plus orchestra) 87-95 B (in orchestra, piano accompanies), modulates to C major at end 95-99 x (piano) 100-105 x (piano plus orchestra) then short passage connecting to A 106-111 A (orchestra), still in C 111-130 A (piano plus orchestra), in d minor then modulates through suspensions through various keys 130-138 y (orchestra) in C major 138-148 y (piano, but with strings at 142-44) 149-164 A (fragments of the rhythm in orchestra, piano accompanies), modulates through various keys 164-167 linking passage similar to 32-36 (in orchestra, piano accompanies), in C major 168-171 D (orchestra, piano accompanies), in F major again 171-177 linking passage similar to 32-36 (in orchestra, piano accompanies) 178-180 D (piano, orchestra accompanies) 181-188 Free passage, based on the triplets of D (piano with orchestral accompaniment), finishing on the shake at 178 on D, signifying the end of the exposition. ==== First ritornello (orchestra) ==== 189-194 A, in C major 194-201 G 202-206 A (repeated fragments) 207-210 G ==== Middle section ==== 211-212 H (piano), in a minor 213-214 A (orchestra, piano accompanies) 215-216 H (piano), in a minor 217-235 A (orchestra and piano closely tied, switching theme back and forward) 235-240 H (a free version, piano) 241-246 A (orchestra), modulating to return to F major for the recapitulation ==== Recapitulation ==== 247-254 A (piano), in F major 255-262 A (orchestra) 262-273 B (orchestra, piano accompanies) 273-278 A (orchestra) 278-285 A (piano, orchestra accompanies) 286-297 A (orchestra, piano accompanies, 291-293 linking passage) 297-305 y (orchestra) 305-315 y (piano, on its own apart from 309-311) 316-330 A (orchestra, piano accompanies) 330-334 transition passage to D, like 32-36 (orchestra, piano accompanies) 335-340 D (orchestra, piano accompanies), 338-340 linking passage by piano 340-347 subsidiary theme like 42-49 (piano, orchestra accompanies) 348-352 transition passage like 32-36 (orchestra, piano accompanies) leading to D 353-359 D (piano, orchestra accompanies), 356-359 linking passage 360-366 A (orchestra, piano accompanies) 367-368 A (piano, orchestra accompanies) 369-370 A (orchestra, piano accompanies) 371-378 Free passage, piano in broken chord triplets, leading to shake on g at 378 signifying the end of the recapitulation. ==== Final ritornello (orchestra apart from cadenza) ==== 379-384 A 384-390 G 390-392 A (fragment) 392 Cadenza (piano: Mozart's is 37 bars long, KV 626aI/58) 393-401 E 401-410 F ==== Themes ==== A (first appearance: bar 1) : \\\\relative c { \\\\override Score.BarNumber #'stencil = ##f \\\\key f \\\\major f4 f8. f16 f4 f  c'4 c c4. \\\\times 2/3 { bes16( a g }  f4) f8. f16 f4 f  e4 g r2  f4 f8. f16 f4 f  c'4. \\\\times 2/3 { bes16( a g } f4.) \\\\times 2/3 { e16( d c }  d4) bes g c  f,4 r r2  \\\\bar \\".\\" } B (first appearance: bar 16) : \\\\relative c' { \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\partial 4 f(  e4 f) r a(  gis4 a) r c  d,4 d'2( c8 bes)  a4( g) r2  \\\\bar \\".\\" } C (first appearance: bar 24) : \\\\relative c { \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\partial 4 e8 r  f8 r g r a r bes r  a32( bes c8.) c4 r2  \\\\bar \\".\\" } D (first appearance: bar 37) : \\\\relative c { \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\times 2/3 { d8( c bes } \\\\times 2/3 { a bes c } \\\\times 2/3 { bes c d } \\\\times 2/3 { c d es) }  \\\\bar \\".\\" } E (first appearance: bar 54) : \\\\relative c { \\\\key f \\\\major r4 c8-. bes-. a-. g-. f-. e-.  d8-. c-. bes-. a-. g-. f-. e-. d-.  c4 r a a8 a  bes4 bes8 bes g4 g  a4 r r2  \\\\bar \\".\\" } F (first appearance: bar 64) : \\\\relative c { \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\partial 4 a16 c8.  f,16 a8. c,16 f8. a,16 c8. e,16 g8.  \\\\bar \\".\\" } x (first appearance: bar 95) : \\\\relative c { \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\partial 4. g8( c e  g4) g4.( a16 g f e d c)  c8( b) b4. b8( d8. c16  e8. d16 f8. e16 g4) f  dis4 e r2  \\\\bar \\".\\" } y (first appearance: bar 130;

Each of the two major themes, the first major, the second minor, is broadly presented and varied; Mozart slightly varies the second presentation in B to avoid exact repetition. The movement is closed with highly characteristic use of the woodwind in quiet rising scales. === Analysis === ==== Exposition ==== 1-10 A (orchestra) 10-14 B (orchestra) 15-20 Connecting passage, modulating through various keys back to C major 21-25 A (orchestra) 26-29 A (piano) 30-35 A (passes back and forwards between piano and orchestra) 35-38 C new thematic material, passing into 39-43 free passage that modulates to G major 44-47 A (orchestra), in G major treated canonically 48-51 A (piano, orchestra accompanies), in G major treated canonically 52-57 D new thematic material (piano), closing the first group 58-61 E Opening of second group with unprepared modulation to g minor (orchestra) 62-66 E (piano, strings accompany) 67-70 F new thematic material in orchestra 71-73 same, with piano, modulating to G major at end 74-76 G (piano in G major) 76-77 G (orchestra, piano accompanies) 77-78 connecting passage (piano) 79-85 H (piano, orchestra accompanies) turning into free passage that modulates back to C major at the close for the recapitulation. ==== Recapitulation ==== 86-95 A (piano first, then both), treated in a varied way 95-98 C (piano, orchestra accompanies. almost identical to 35-38), passing into 99-102 free passage that modulates into G major, then immediately back to C major 103-111 A treated canonically as in 48-51, extended (piano and orchestra together) 111-116 D (piano) in C major, 116-120 E (orchestra), this time in c minor 121-124 E (piano, orchestra accompanies), still c minor 125-129 F (orchestra), c minor 129-135 same, with piano, modulating to C major at end 135-136 G (orchestra) 136-141 connecting passage (piano, orchestra accompanies) 141-146 H (piano, orchestra accompanies) turning into free passage that leads back to A stays in C major 146-150 A (orchestra plus piano) ==== Coda ==== 150-155 scales in orchestra 156-159 A - final, ornamented statement by piano, accompanied by the orchestral scales. ==== Themes ==== A (first appearance: bar 1) : \\\\relative c { \\\\time 6/8 e4. g8( f d)  c8 r r e( f fis  g8) r r g,( a b)  c8( d e f g a)  e4( d8) r4 r8  \\\\bar \\".\\" } == Third movement == The movement, described by Girdlestone as the concerto's strongest movement, is in a broadly rondo form. In contrast to the languid second movement, the theme is sharply defined and introduced by the piano, quickly followed by the winds. The theme establishes the main motif of this piece: quaver-quaver-crotchet, quaver-quaver-crotchet. The two quavers in each group of three notes are of identical pitch. This motif is in fact used very frequently throughout the piece, a technique similar to the motif development used by Beethoven in his Symphony No.5, First Movement. The orchestra then comes up with the second theme - a scalar passage which is then presented in a contrapuntal fashion. The piano remains silent during this time. Then the piano makes its re-entrance and starts off with runs. The orchestra provides continuous accompaniment with the main motif and different themes. At one point the opening material returns and the second theme is played again, though not in the same pitch or with the same instrumentation. The treatment is contrapuntal but somewhat looser than previously, the piano now playing along with the orchestra. A sweeping passage by piano and then by orchestra leads into the cadenza which provides a temporary break from the relentless exhilaration of the movement. After the cadenza comes the coda where the main theme is built up bit by bit to a conclusion. The piece closes with three emphatic chords played by all instruments, including piano. All in all this is one of Mozart's most miraculous movements - the balance between the extreme light-heartedness of the melodies and the formal complexity of the motifs and the counterpoint being simply astounding. == References == * Hutchings, A.

It is notable as the birthplace of Kate Roberts, the greatest Welsh writer of the 20th century; her childhood home is now a museum (see below). ==History and description== The view is of Anglesey, Yr Eifl and by walking around you can reach common land called Comin Uwch Gwyrfai and Y Lon Wen. Nearby villages include Y Fron and Rhostryfan. Rhosgadfan is on the border of Snowdonia National Park. The nearest town is Caernarfon and the nearest city is Bangor. There are no shops in Rhosgadfan even though it has a population of almost 2,000. The closest mountain is Moel Tryfan Moel Tryfan is at grid ref. ; a larger mountain nearby, Tryfan, is also sometimes called Moel Tryfan. and people from the school walk up often to collect money for educational things. Charles Darwin visited the mountain and recognised evidence of glaciation there . Farming is the main economic activity in the village. However, the village once had a quarry behind it. The Dyffryn Nantlle (Nantlle Valley) area is well known for quarries. The one near Rhosgadfan was a film set for the Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life. The farming mostly consists of sheep rearing but some other animals inhabit the area. The football club, Mountain Rangers, is very well attended and is the focal point of the village. Mountain Rangers The Welsh TV programme C'mon Midffild was filmed in the village hall, prior to its destruction. The hall was destroyed in a blaze believed to have been caused by arson. Nobody has been brought to justice. During March and April 2010 filming of SNOWDONIA 1890, a new television series to be shown on BBC1 Wales in the autumn of 2010, took place at various locations in the area. == Education == Cae'r Gors - the Kate Roberts Heritage Centre, Rhosgadfan.

In 1836, Scottish engineer James Nasmyth, in partnership with Holbrook Gaskell, built the Bridgewater Foundry in Patricroft. Nasmyth chose Patricroft, located on the west side of Manchester, ‘because of the benefit of breathing pure air, realising that a healthy workforce is a more efficient workforce'. He named the works \\"Bridgewater Foundry\\" in memory of Canal Duke, the first canal maker in Britain. Bridgewater Foundry was located adjacent the Bridgewater Canal and the Manchester to Liverpool railway line. The foundry soon expanded to become a major supplier of steam locomotives. During the First World War the factory's production was mainly diverted to munitions work. At the start of the Second World War it became a Royal Ordnance Factory, producing shells, tanks and guns. The engineering works closed in 1989: the site is now part of a business and technology centre. The area was part of the municipal borough of Eccles in Lancashire until 1974 when it was incorporated into Salford, Greater Manchester. ==Churches== *Christ Church Christ Church on Liverpool Road is the Anglican Parish Church of Patricroft.

Their foray among the enemy, narrated in Book nine, demonstrates their stealth and prowess as warriors, but ends as a tragedy: the loot Euryalus acquires (a glistening Rutulian helmet) attracts attention, and the two die together. Virgil presents their deaths as a loss of admirable loyalty and valor. They also appear in Book 5, during the funeral games of Anchises, where Virgil takes note of their amor pius, a love that exhibits the pietas that is Aeneas's own distinguishing virtue.James Anderson Winn, The Poetry of War (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 162. In describing the bonds of devotion between the two men, Virgil draws on conventions of erotic poetry that have suggested a romantic relationship to some, interpreted by scholars in light of the Greek custom of paiderastia.Louis Crompton, Homosexuality and Civilization (Harvard University Press, 2003), pp. 84–86; Winn, The Poetry of War, p. 162. ==Background== Nisus and Euryalus are among the refugees who in the aftermath of the Trojan War flee under the leadership of Aeneas, the highest-ranking Trojan to survive. Nisus was the son of Hyrtacus,Aeneid 9.175, 234, 319, 406. and was known for his hunting. The family cultivated the huntress-goddess who inhabited Mount Ida.Aeneid 9.406–408. Euryalus, who was younger, has spent his entire life in a state of war and displacement.Mark Petrini, The Child and the Hero: Coming of Age in Catullus and Vergil (University of Michigan Press, 1997), pp. 21–22. He was trained as a fighter by his battle-hardened father, Opheltes,bellis adsuetus, Aeneid 9.201. of whom he speaks with pride. Opheltes seems to have died at Troy. After their wanderings around the Mediterranean, the Trojans are fated to land on the shores of Italy. Some members of their party, especially the matres (\\"mothers\\"), are settled at Sicily before the Italian war, but the mother of Euryalus refused to be aparted from her son and continued on.Aeneid 9.284–286; Petrini, The Child and the Hero, p. 22. ==Characterization== Although Nisus and Euryalus are inseparable as a pair in the narrative, each is given a distinct characterization. Nisus is the elder, more experienced man. He is swift and accurate (acerrimus) in the use of projectile weapons, the javelin (iaculum) and arrows. Euryalus is still young, with the face of a boy (puer) who hasn't started shaving, just old enough to bear arms. He was more beautiful (pulchrior) than any other of Aeneas's men at arms. Euryalus maintains a loving relationship with his mother. He refuses to see her before he leaves on his mission, because he cannot bear her inevitable tears, and yet his first concern amid promises of rich rewards is that she be cared for if he fails to return.Petrini, The Child and the Hero, p. 22. ==Plot and themes== The foray by Nisus and Euryalus is a well-developed, self-contained episodePetrini, The Child and the Hero, p. 21. that occurs in the \\"Iliadic\\" half of the Aeneid, set during the war through which the displaced Trojans established themselves among the inhabitants of central Italy. Virgil introduces the characters anew, but they have already appeared in Book 5,The race is narrated at Aeneid 5.286ff. at the funeral games held for Aeneas's father, Anchises, during the \\"Odyssean\\" first half of the epic.Although the games are an episode in the wanderings, they recall the funeral games for Patroclus in Iliad 23; Lee Fratantuono, Madness Unchained: A Reading of Virgil's Aeneid (Lexington Books, 2007), p. 131. The games demonstrate behaviors that in the war to come will result in victory or defeat; in particular, the footrace in which Nisus and Euryalus compete prefigures their disastrous mission.W.S. Anderson, The Art of the Aeneid (Bolchazy-Carducci, 2005, originally published 1969) , p. 60. The five runners are, in the order in which they would have finished, Nisus, Salius, Euryalus, Elymus, and Diores. Nisus, however, slips in the blood from the cattle sacrificed during the religious rituals that preceded the race. Recognizing that he can't recover his lead, he trips Salius to hand the victory to Euryalus. Nisus shows himself willing to sacrifice his own honor in order to help Euryalus, but the gesture demonstrates not only his loyalty but a willingness to cheat. Salius objects to the foul, and is given a consolation prize. Nisus receives compensation for his bad luck, and Euryalus gets the winner's prize. The incident is treated as comic, but becomes ominous in light of what happens to the pair later.Anderson, The Art of the Aeneid, p. 60. Although the night raid of Nisus and Euryalus has a discrete narrative unity, it is closely related to major themes of the epic, such as the transition from boyhood to manhood, also present in the characters of Ascanius, Pallas, and Lausus,Petrini, The Child and the Hero, p. 21. and the waste of young lives in war. Nisus and Euryalus's killing spree through the camp of the Rutuli is one of Virgil's most brutal descriptions of combat (especially when Nisus beheads the chief Remus with his warriors Lamyrus, Lamus and Serranus). The poetry of Euryalus's death—\\"as when a richly hued flower is cut down by the plough and withers as it dies, or when the rains beat down the poppy's head, weighed down on slack neck\\" — is a replay of the death of Gorgythion in the Iliad. ==References== == Further reading == * Virgil, Aeneid, V.294; IX.176-445. * Dictionary of Classical Mythology.

He had previously been a member of the NSDAP (1939–1945). From 1957 to 1966, he served as Federal Minister for Post and Communication. A member of the German parliament for more than 40 years, he served as the 7th President of the Bundestag from 1979 to 1983. ==Life== Stücklen was born in Heideck. After an apprenticeship, he worked as an electrician while studying engineering in a correspondence course. He was drafted into the Reichsarbeitsdienst in 1936 and later into the Wehrmacht, where he served as a soldier in World War II from 1940 to 1943, when he was released as unfit for service due to a knee injury. He then worked in the electrical industry and was able to finish his training as an electrical engineer in Mittweida, after which he became a departmental manager at AEG. After 1945, he worked in his parents' locksmithery at Heideck. He co-founded the BMS Ingenieurgesellschaft mbH & Co. KG engineering company in 1952 and was a company associate until 1989. Richard Stücklen was married with two children. He died in 2002 in Weißenburg in Bayern from heart disease. ==Political career== Stücklen joined the Nazi Party in 1939 CSU-Landesgruppenvorsitzende After the end of World War II in 1945, Stücklen was one of the founders of the CSU in Heideck and in Hilpoltstein. He was elected to the Bundestag in 1949 as representative of the electoral district of Weißenburg. He was the youngest member of the first Bundestag Speech by Wolfgang Thierse on the occasion of Stücklen's death. and stayed a directly elected member of the Bundestag (first representing Weißenburg, later Roth) for eleven legislative periods until the end of 1990, longer than any other member before or after him. Stücklen was part of a group of parliamentarians who unsuccessfully proposed changing the German voting system to plurality voting in 1955. After the 1957 Federal elections, Stücklen became Federal Minister for Post and Communication in Konrad Adenauer's cabinet on 29 October 1957. He was the youngest German Federal minister at that time. He kept his post in the cabinets of Ludwig Erhard. On 1 December 1966, Stücklen left office and was replaced by Werner Dollinger in Kurt Georg Kiesinger's grand coalition cabinet. Between 1967 and 1976, he was chairman of the CSU parliamentary group and deputy chairman of the CDU/CSU group. After the 1976 Federal elections, where he ran as a potential minister in a possible Helmut Kohl cabinet, he was elected Vice President of the Bundestag on 14 December 1976. Shortly after the Bundesversammlung had elected Karl Carstens as President of Germany, Stücklen became his successor as President of the Bundestag. After the 1983 elections, Rainer Barzel became president of the parliament, and Stücklen returned to his vice presidential post which he held until he quit parliament on 20 December 1990. One of the most famous Bundestag sessions presided over by Stücklen was that of 18 October 1984, when Stücklen excluded Green Party member Jürgen Reents from the session for calling Helmut Kohl \\"bought by Flick\\".

It's located above sea level close to the city of Skole, southwest of Lviv. Slavske is an urban village and a popular ski resort in the Skole Beskids range of the Carpathian mountains in western Ukraine. It's one of the biggest Ukrainian winter sports centers. Population: . ==Location== Slavske is situated in the valley of the Opir and Slavka rivers in an area traditionally inhabited by the Boyko highlanders, adjacent to southeast Poland and northeast Slovakia. The mountains surrounding Slavske are of volcanic origin with forest cover, with an average height of about 1,200 m to 1,400 m. The town is conveniently located on an important rail line which connects Ukrainian cities with Uzhhorod as well as Slovakia and Hungary. ==History== According to tradition, Slavske takes its name from a band of intrepid warriors of Early East Slavs (Drevlians) led by Prince Sviatoslav Volodymyrovich, one of the ill-fated sons of Vladimir I of Kiev killed by his half-brother Sviatopolk I in 1015. Sviatoslav was attempting to escape to Hungary after the murder of his brothers Boris and Gleb when he was intercepted by Sviatopolk's men and killed in the upper reaches of the Opir River. Opir, incidentally, means \\"resistance.\\" Local lore identifying his burial site and stories connecting Danylo Romanovych, Prince of Volhynia and Galicia, to the Boyko Region suggest that the locality figured to an extent in the history of Kievan Rus' and Ukraine. Legend has it that the region was among those ravaged by the rampaging Mongol-Tatar horde led by Batu Khan during its campaign to invade Central Europe in 1240–41. The invasion also saw Kiev, Volodymyr-Volynskyi and Halych destroyed, thus interfering with Danylo's plans for the unification of Ukrainian territories. Material evidence of the village's existence, however, can only be traced back to the year 1483. Records indicate that the village later belonged to the Potocki family before being transferred to Evhen Kinsky, who then sold it to Baron Hredel. Following the opening of the railway line between Stryi and Mukachevo in 1878, Slavske became a popular stop. Slavske’s history as a winter sports centre as well as a spa town goes back to the 19th century, when it was part of Galicia – a province of Austria-Hungary. Austrians built hotels in the town, and by 1918, when the town became part of Poland, it was a very popular destination, attended mostly by tourists from nearby city of Lviv. Between 1919 and 1939 several ski lifts and ski platforms were built in Slavske and its vicinity, most of them on Pohar mountain. Slavske. Church the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (1901). ==Leisure== Slavske first became known as a skiing center in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The first cableways and ski jumps were built in the 1920s and 1930s. It reached the peak of its popularity during the Soviet era when it became the main training grounds of the USSR Olympic team. While its pistes cannot rival those in Europe, there are slopes, such as the central ski track operated by the Dinamo sports centre, touted by local authorities as being of international competitive standards. The best slopes are found on Mt Trostian, which is 1,235 metres above sea level. A new resort is being built on Mt Zvorets, located two kilometres from Slavske toward Volosianka, which is expected to compete against the Slavske Trostian resort. The other mountains in the area are Politekh, Pohar, Grabovets and Krokus. The skiing season begins in late November and ends in late March. In summer, holiday makers engage in fishing as well as walking and riding excursions or berry and mushroom picking. ==References== ==External links== *Slavske Resort site *Skiing site *Trostian mountain * Category:Urban-type settlements in Lviv Oblast Category:Ski areas and resorts in Ukraine Category:Skole Raion Category:Tourist attractions in the Soviet Union ","title":"Slavske"},{"id":"7826489","text":"Clan Lockhart is a Lowland Scottish clan.Way, George and Squire, Romily.

Like many other Scottish families the Locards came from England to Scotland after they had been dispossessed of lands by William the Conqueror. In the twelfth century there were Lockards near Penrith and later in Annandale. In Annandale the town of Lockerbie is said to have been named after them. The chiefly family finally settled Ayrshire and Lanarkshire where they have held lands for over seven hundred years. A charter of 1323 is the earliest paper in the family archives, in which Sir Symon Locard bound himself and his heirs to pay an annual rent of £10 out of the lands of Lee and Cartland, South Lanarkshire. Sir Symon's grandfather, Stephen Locard, founded the village of Stevenson in Ayrshire. His son, Symon, held lands in Ayrshire and founded a village called Symons Toun, which is today called Symington. ===Wars of Scottish Independence and the Crusades=== Ceiling painting of the Lockhart arms, Tower of Hallbar, South Lanarkshire, Scotland. Symon Locard, 2nd of Lee, won fame for himself and his family in the Wars of Scottish Independence against the English when he fought alongside king Robert the Bruce and was knighted for his loyal service. Sir Symon accompanied 'Good Sir James Douglas' of the Clan Douglas when he took the heart of Robert the Bruce on the crusades in 1330. It was Sir Symon who carried the key to the casket in which the heart was carried. Symon rescued the casket and heart and returned it to Scotland after James Douglas had been killed in Spain fighting the Moors. A heart with a fetterlock was from then on included in the chief's arms and also the deed is commemorated in the clan motto. ====The Lee Penny==== During the crusades of the 14th century the Lockharts brought back a precious heirloom. It is known as the \\"Lee Penny\\". Sir Simon Lockhart captured a Moorish amir in battle and received from the man's mother as part of his ransom an amulet or stone with healing powers. The amir's mother told Sir Simon that the stone was a sovereign remedy against bleeding and fever, the bite of a mad dog, and sickness in horses and cattle. It was later set in a silver coin which has now been identified as a fourpenny piece from the reign of King Edward IV. The Lee Penny is kept in a gold snuffbox which was a gift from Maria Theresa of Austria, Empress of Austria to her general Count James Lockhart in 1789. The fame of the Lee Penny spread through Scotland and Northern England and there are many recorded occasions when it was employed with apparent success. The coin was exempted from the Church of Scotland's prohibition on charms and was lent to the citizens of Newcastle during the reign of King Charles I to protect them from the plague. A sum of between £1000 and £6000 was pledged for its return.Westwood, Jennifer and Kingshill, Sophia (2009). The Lore of Scotland. A guide to Scottish Legends. London : Random House. p. 192 The penny gained further fame in the 19th century for inspiring Sir Walter Scott's 1825 novel The Talisman.James Y. Simpson, Archaeological Essays, Vol. 1, 1872, p. 215 ===16th and 17th centuries=== The Tower of Hallbar was purchased in 1681 by George Lockhart of Lee Castle, whose estate adjoined it. In 1547 Alan Lockhart of Lee was killed at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh. Sir James Lockhart of Lee (b.1594) was appointed by Charles I of England as a gentleman of the Privy Council and was knighted. He was also appointed to the Supreme Court Bench taking the title of Lord Lee. ====Civil War==== During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms he was a zealous royalist and was captured at Alyth in 1651. His son was Sir William Lockhart of Lee who was a distinguished soldier and fought at the Battle of Worcester as a royalist in 1651. However he later reconciled with Oliver Cromwell and married Cromwell's niece. As a result, he was not in favour with the Stuart monarchs when they were restored in 1660 and made his home in France. He later campaigned on the continent and Cardinal Mazarin offered to make him mareshcal of France. Sir George Lockhart (1630–1689) was the second son of Sir James Lockhart, Lord Lee, Lord Justice Clerk and became one of the most famous advocates at the Edinburgh Bar. He became Lord President of the Court of Session in 1685 and was M.P. for Lanarkshire in both the English and Scottish Parliaments. His knighthood was conferred in 1663 and the Carnwath and Dryden estates acquired by him in 1681. He was murdered on Easter Sunday 1689 on his way home from church by a dissatisfied litigant named Chiesly of Kersewell and Dalry. ===18th century and Jacobite risings=== George Lockhart, Second of Carnwath (1673–1731) was a fervent Jacobite; he became Principal Agent to the exiled King James after the Jacobite rising of 1715. He was one of the Commissioners for the Treaty of Union, and the only one against it. He was one of the earliest of the agricultural improvers. He married Euphemia Montgomery, daughter of the ninth Earl of Eglinton; they had fourteen children. He died as the result of a duel. James Lockhart inherited the estates in 1777 and saw service on the continent where he rose to become a count of the Order of Maria Theresa and a general of that empress's imperial forces. ==Clan Chief== Chief: Ranald Lockhart of the Lee, Chief of the Name and Arms of Lockhart. ==Clan Castle== The seat of the Chief of the Clan Lockhart was at Lee Castle near Lanark, but have since passed out of Lockhart hands.

Paternoster Row was described as \\"almost synonymous\\" with the book trade. It was part of an area also called St Paul's Churchyard. The street was devastated by aerial bombardment during the World War II. In 2003 the street was replaced with Paternoster Square, the modern home of the London Stock Exchange, although a City of London Corporation road sign remains in the square near where Paternoster Row once stood. ==Name== The street is supposed to have received its name from the fact that, when the monks and clergy of St Paul's Cathedral would go in procession chanting the great litany, they would recite the Lord's Prayer (Pater Noster being its opening line in Latin) in the litany along this part of the route). The prayers said at these processions may have also given the names to nearby Ave Maria Lane and Amen Corner. An alternative etymology is the early traders, who sold a type of prayer been known as a \\"pater noster\\". ==History== The name of the street dates back at least to the 16th century. Houses in St. Paul's Churchyard were damaged in the Great Fire of London in 1666, burning down the old St. Paul's Cathedral. When the new St. Paul's Cathedral was erected, booksellers returned after a number of years. Gentleman Henry (Robert) Gunnell, Esq. (1724–1794) of Millbank, a senior officer in the House of Commons and House of Lords who worked the Tax Acts for the American Colonies with Prime Minister George Grenville and also Lord North, bought No.8 Paternoster Row in 1778 as one of his portfolio of properties and soon after gave it to his eldest son John Gunnell (1750–1796), a Westminster gentleman. John though seldom stayed at the house, as he lived mainly at Margate, Kent, and it was instead used as a literary venue by his father Henry (Robert) and his friends, where among other notable members, Jane Timbury would attend. Her stance as a novelist and poet later inspired Jane Austen in her career. Henry (Robert) Gunnell's wife Anne Rozea (1727–1795) of Duke's Court, St.Martin's Lane (situated where now the National Gallery cafe is positioned) was known for her attendance, reciting moving French poetry dressed in an exquisite mantua with ornate jubilee hat. Johann Christian Bach (1735–1782) was also known to have attended on occasions. Henry (Robert) had bought No.8 Paternoster Row from Philanthropist Sylvanus Hall, a successful London currier and leather goods craftsman (Guildhall Library) and also governor of both St.Thomas and Bridewell Hospitals, who owned two other houses on Paternoster Row and had earlier worked with Anne Rozea at \\"Gunnell’s Hat Warehouse\\" at No.54 Chandois Street (next door to the Mercers Coventry Cross), Covent Garden, from the mid 1760s. There he oversaw the manufacture of fashionable hats, cloaks and silk garments and later married Henry (Robert) Gunnell and Anne Rozea's daughter, Ann Gunnell (1746–1804), at the church of St.Augustine, Watling Street, 02.Feb.1769 just east of St.Paul's cathedral. They lived at No.8 Paternoster Row for nine years, until her father bought it for his son John as part of his inheritance as mentioned in 1778. Ann and Sylvanus Hall then moved to a house on Golden Square, Soho. On the 21.Feb.1776, at the Old Bailey, Jeremiah Pope was indicted for stealing ‘six hundred pounds weight of lead piping’ from the three properties (Nos. 8, 9, and 10) of Sylvanus Hall on Paternoster Row. Another well-known visitor to No.8 was Thomas Vanhagen, whose famous pastry shop was located beside Pauls Alley, St Paul’s Churchyard, facing the North Entrance and where many Londoners took their refreshment. Various caricatures of Vanhagen (British Museum) were published over the years. His daughter Charlotte married Henry (Robert) and Anne’s son Henry Gunnell (1754-1823), also of the House of Commons, 10.July.1779 at the parish of St.Gregory by St.Paul's. The Gunnells eventually sold No.8 Paternoster Row in 1794. A bust of Aldus Manutius, writer and publisher, can be seen above the fascia of number 13. The bust was placed there in 1820 by Bible publisher Samuel Bagster. It was reported that Charlotte Brontë and Anne Brontë stayed at the Chapter Coffeehouse on the street when visiting London in 1847. They were in the city to meet their publisher regarding Jane Eyre. A fire broke out at number 20 Paternoster Row on 6 February 1890. Occupied by music publisher Fredrick Pitman, the first floor was found to be on fire by a police officer at 21:30. The fire alarm was sounded at St. Martin's-le-Grand and fire crews extinguished the flames in half an hour. The floor was badly damaged, with smoke, heat and water impacting the rest of the building. This blaze was followed later the same year on 5 October by 'an alarming fire'. At 00:30 a fire was discovered at W. Hawtin and Sons, based in numbers 24 and 25. The wholesale stationers' warehouse was badly damaged by the blaze. On 21 November 1894, police raided an alleged gambling club which was based on the first floor of 59 Paternoster Row. The club known both as the 'City Billiard Club' and the 'Junior Gresham Club' had been there barely three weeks at the time of the raid. Forty-five arrests were made, including club owner Albert Cohen. On 4 November 1939, a large-scale civil defence exercise was held in the City of London. One of the simulated seats of fire was in Paternoster Row. Trübner & Co. was one of the publishing companies on Paternoster Row. ==Destruction during World War II== The street was devastated by aerial bombardment during the Blitz of World War II, suffering particularly heavy damage in the night raid of 29–30 December 1940, later characterised as the Second Great Fire of London, during which an estimated 5 million books were lost in the fires caused by tens of thousands of incendiary bombs. After the raid a letter was written to The Times describing: Another correspondent with the newspaper, Ernest W. Larby, described his experience of 25 years working on Paternoster Row: The ruins of Paternoster Row were visited by Wendell Willkie in January 1941. He said, \\"I thought that the burning of Paternoster Row, the street where the books are published, was rather symbolic. They [the Germans] have destroyed the place where the truth is told\\". ==Printers and booksellers based in Paternoster Row== The Globe' Note: Before about 1762, premises in London had signs rather than numbers. * The Tyger's Head – Christopher Barker (????), his son Robert Barker (1545–1629)A Dictionary of Printers and Printing. * The Star – Henry Denham (1564) * The Brazen Serpent (1627–1650) – Robert Dawlman (1627–1635, 1635–1638, died 1659), Luke Fawne (1635–1638, 1639–1641), Samuel Gellibrand (1639–1641, 1641–1650) * The Golden Ball/Ball (1650–1675) – Samuel Gellibrand (1654, 1655, 1656, 1661, 1667, 1669, 1673) (died 1675), two of his sons Edward Gellibrand (1676, 1678, 1679, 1680, 1681, 1685), John Gellibrand (1679–1685), F.?

In 1969, Lees moved to Israel at the Tel Aviv University and in 1970, he established the first linguistics department there. Lees also went to India on a tour under the patronization of the Ford Foundation. He taught intensive courses on contemporary linguistics at Delhi University and at the Central Institute of English and Foreign Languages (CIEFL), Hyderabad. Lees was known as a fierce partisan of Chomsky's brand of linguistics, and could be withering in his criticism.

He served as speaker of the Assembly from 1969 to 1973 and ran unsuccessfully for Governor of New York in 1978. ==Life and career== Duryea was born on October 18, 1921, in Montauk, Suffolk County, New York, the son of Perry B. Duryea Sr. (1891–1968). Duryea Sr. ran a wholesale seafood business, and later was a state senator and State Conservation Commissioner. Duryea Jr. attended East Hampton High School and graduated from Colgate University in 1942. He attained the rank of lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy as a pilot of the U.S. Naval Air Transport Service, and entered the family business full- time after World War II. In 1944 Duryea married Elizabeth Ann Weed with whom he had two children, Lynn Duryea born in 1947 and Perry B. Duryea III born in 1949. The Duryeas divorced in 1990.

During the campaign, he had called for juveniles to be tried as adults for certain violent crimes, a move steadfastly opposed by Carey. The situation was dramatically altered, however, when Willie Bosket, a 15-year-old from Harlem, killed three people in the New York City Subway and was only sentenced to five years in a state youth facility. The outcry over such a lenient sentence led Carey to reverse course and support a law allowing juveniles as young as 13 to be tried as adults. A New York State office building in Hauppauge, Long Island, was renamed the Perry B Duryea Jr State Office Building at the request of Suffolk County Court Judge, the Hon. Martin J Kerins. Duryea died on January 11, 2004, in Southampton Hospital in Southampton, New York, from injuries suffered in a car accident and was buried at the Fort Hill Cemetery in Montauk. ==Sources== ==External links== *Colgate University Obituary *Suffolk Jetport Seen at an Impasse *Finding Aid for the Papers of Perry B.

McLeod: Lesbian and gay liberation in Canada: a selected annotated chronology, 1964-1975: Toronto: ECW Press/Homewood Books, 1996: . Klippert, originally from Kindersley, Saskatchewan, was raised in Calgary, Alberta. In 1960 he was convicted on eighteen charges of gross indecency and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Upon his release, he moved to northern Canada. He was working as a mechanic in Pine Point, Northwest Territories, in 1965 when he was picked up by police for questioning in connection with a case of suspected arson. Although he was found not to have had any involvement in the fire, Klippert voluntarily admitted to having had recent consensual homosexual relations with four different adult men. He was subsequently arrested and charged with four counts of \\"gross indecency\\". A court-ordered psychiatrist assessed Klippert as \\"incurably homosexual\\", and Klippert was sentenced to \\"preventive detention\\" (that is, indefinitely) as a dangerous sexual offender. Klippert appealed to the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories; his appeal was dismissed. He then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada; his appeal was dismissed on November 7, 1967, in a controversial 3–2 decision.Klippert v The Queen, [1967 SCR 822.] The day after Klippert's conviction was upheld, New Democratic Party leader Tommy Douglas invoked Klippert's name in the House of Commons of Canada, stating that \\"homosexuality is a social and psychiatric problem rather than a criminal one\\", and asking Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson if he would consider setting up a commission to study the issue, similar to the Wolfenden Committee in Britain which brought in \\"enlightened and humane recommendations for coping with this problem.\\"Canada. House of Commons Debates (Hansard), 27th Parliament, 2nd Session : Vol. 4, p. 4036 (November 8, 1967). The Prime Minister replied that he would be very glad to consider that matter. Douglas followed up with a second question, asking the Minister of Justice, Pierre Trudeau, if this matter was being considered by officials in the Department of Justice. Trudeau replied that \\"one aspect of this matter is being looked at in the context of another law.\\"Canada. House of Commons Debates (Hansard), 27th Parliament, 2nd Session : Vol. 4, p. 4037 (November 8, 1967). Within six weeks, Pierre Trudeau presented the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69 (Bill C-150 of 1968), an omnibus bill which, among other things, decriminalized homosexual acts between consenting adults. The law passed, and homosexual acts between consenting adults were decriminalized in Canada in 1969. Klippert remained in prison until his release on July 21, 1971. He lived 25 more years before his death from kidney disease in 1996. In 2016 the government of Justin Trudeau indicated that it plans to recommend a formal posthumous pardon of Klippert's conviction.\\"Trudeau to urge pardon for man deemed a dangerous sex offender for being gay in 1960s\\".

Bird Machine Company was acquired by Baker Hughes, Incorporated in 1989. ==Origin== Bird Machine Company can trace its origin to a partnership established by Charles Sumner Bird in the early 1900s. The first product, the BIRD Rotary Paper Screen, was a major contribution in the advancement for stock cleaning in paper mills. The Company was incorporated in 1909. Bird soon expanded to a broad line of equipment for stock preparation and cleaning in the pulp and paper industry, as well as significant accessory equipment used in the making and finishing of paper and paperboard. The Company established a broad line of centrifugal and filtration equipment for liquid/solids separation in 1932. The significant development was the patented design of the first planetary gear unit applied to centrifugal equipment. This patent was issued in June, 1934 and formed the foundation for the design utilized in the BIRD Solid Bowl and Screen Bowl Centrifuges and paved the way for the development and application of decanter centrifuges into the process industry. In the early 1940s, Frank Young of Bird Machine Company patented the BIRD-Young Filter. This fast, efficient filter quickly found applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical markets. The BIRD-Young Filter can efficiently separate and wash solids in a machine that is a fraction of the size of conventional Rotary vacuum-drum filter. In 1964, the Company launched a major program of plant and facilities expansion at South Walpole, Massachusetts, USA headquarters. This policy of providing new facilities and equipment has continued. Today, this headquarters facility includes a complete analytical and pilot scale laboratory, a customer and employee training complex, offices and manufacturing. The manufacturing complex includes CNC machine tools, fabrication, assembly and test resources. In 1965, Bird Machine Company of Canada, Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bird Machine Company, was activated in Montreal. As the Canadian operation grew, the Company expanded further by relocating the manufacturing plant to Saskatoon in 1967. During the 1970s, Bird initiated an aggressive program of providing local sales, service and manufacturing to support its customers. The Bird Companies Charitable Foundation was a supporter of Northeastern University and a plaque honoring them for their contributions can be found in Dodge Hall on the main Boston campus. ==Purchase== In 1989, Bird Machine Company was acquired by Baker Hughes, Incorporated, a diversified oil field services company based in Houston, Texas. In 1996, Ketema Process Equipment Company of Santee, California was purchased by Baker Hughes and merged into Bird Machine Company. The acquisition of Ketema provided Bird with an entrée into the pharmaceutical and fine chemical market segments with batch products such as the TOLHURST and MARK III Centrifuges, PROCESS 2000 Vertical Peeler Centrifuge, and NIAGARA and MAVADISC Filters. On July 7, 1997, Baker Hughes, Incorporated announced the completion of the acquisition of the Environmental Technology Division of Deutz AG that consisted of the KHD (today Deutz AG) centrifuge, filtration and thermal product line located in Cologne, Germany, and the R&B; filter press operation based in Wuppertal. Although the product lines of Bird and KHD were similar (KHD was a former licensee of Bird), this acquisition provided Bird with a significant market share in the worldwide municipal market, a much stronger presence in Europe and Southern Africa as well as the premier filter press product line. Shortly after the acquisition, the R&B; operation was relocated to Cologne. In October 1998, Bird Machine Company combined resources with two other Baker Hughes companies to form Baker Process. In June 2001, Baker Process was realigned into the three former legacy companies. In October 2003, Bird Machine was acquired by Andritz AG.www.andritz.comwww.corporate-ir.net ==References== Category:Companies based in Massachusetts Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1906 Category:1906 establishments in Massachusetts ","title":"Bird Machine Company"},{"id":"7826716","text":"Pleasant Hill High School may refer to: *Pleasant Hill High School (Illinois), Pleasant Hill, Illinois *Pleasant Hill High School (Louisiana), Pleasant Hill, Sabine Parish, Louisiana *Pleasant Hill High School (Missouri), Pleasant Hill, Missouri *Pleasant Hill High School (Oregon), Pleasant Hill, Oregon *Pleasant Hill High School (California), Pleasant Hill, California ","title":"Pleasant Hill High School"},{"id":"7826724","text":"Vladimir Valentinovich Alexandrov (; born 1938; disappeared 1985) was a Soviet/Russian physicist who created a mathematical model for the nuclear winter theory.

The last moments of his life are shrouded in contradiction. When questioned by journalists in 1986, his acquaintances in Madrid gave differing accounts of how much he resisted when being driven towards the Soviet embassy. In 2016 Andrew Revkin argued, \\"He's almost assuredly dead. ...This wasn't just, you know, thumb-sucking climate science. It was in the middle of a war—a long Cold War—and there were bodies.\\" ==Research== According to an FBI white paper, Alexandrov was a mathematician specializing in computer science. In 1976 he was directed to shift his research from gas dynamics and plasma mechanics to climatology. In late 1970 he was assigned to the laboratory of computational physics in climatology at the Dorodnicyn Computing Centre, working with Professor Nikita Moiseyev and A. M. Tarko. He was sent to the USA under a research exchange agreement, and studied at the NCAR in 1978, 1980 and 1982, which gave him access to the Cray-1 supercomputer. In 1983 he was directed by Evgeny Velikhov to work on nuclear winter scenarios heading an ad hoc group of 20 scientists.Interagency Intelligence Assessment (1984): The Soviet Approach to Nuclear Winter, page 10-11 A pioneer in global climate modelling, he presented a mathematical solution to baroclinicity in 1982.Alexandrov, V.

Thompson, two major figures in the development of the nuclear winter scenario, described Alexandrov and Stenchikov's model as \\"a very weak piece of work\\" and \\"a primitive rendition of an obsolete US model\\".Laurence Badash, A Nuclear Winter's Tale, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2009 Later they were to rescind these \\"harsh\\" criticisms and instead applauded Alexandrov's pioneering work, saying that the Soviet model shared the weaknesses of all the others.An assessment of global atmospheric effects of a major nuclear war pg 59 ==Disappearance== How Alexandrov disappeared and what happened to him afterward remains unknown,Vera Rich, \\"Nuclear winter expert vanishes without trace,\\" Nature, Vol. 316, 4 July 1985, 3 Vera Rich, \\"Aleksandrov still not found,\\" Nature, Vol. 316, 8 August 1985, 479 Tim Beardsley, \\"Soviet missing person,\\" Nature, Vol. 317, 19 September 1985, 191 I. Andronov, \\"Where is Vladimir Aleksandrov?\\", Literaturnaya Gazeta, n.30, 23 July 1986 but several theories have been put forward. According to an article in the newsmagazine Time in October 1985, the leading thoughts on the matter were that \\"The mystery of his disappearance had been compounded by the suspicions of some Western scientists that the nuclear winter scenario was promoted by Moscow to give antinuclear groups in the U.S. and Europe some fresh ammunition against America's arms buildup\\"...and that others \\"speculate that Alexandrov was planning to renounce the nuclear winter concept and may have been kidnapped by the KGB. According to another theory, the physicist defected to the West.\\"A 1985 Time magazine account of Alexandrov's disappearance. Also found in \\"Another Return From the Cold. By Jacob V. Lamar Jr. Sunday, June 24, 2001\\" A. Levakov suggests that his supercomputer work on nuclear winter was as embarrassing to the Soviet Union as it was to the USA.A. Levakov, \\"Supercomputer Technology and Projects in the U.S.\\", Jet Info online, No.12 (115)/2002 According to the Mitrokhin Archive, during a conference in 1987 the head of the KGB's First Chief Directorate Vladimir Kryuchkov accused the CIA's Deputy Director Robert Gates of kidnapping Alexandrov and holding him against his will. Andrew Revkin assumes that he was a spy; it was never clear whether for the USSR, USA, or both. US colleagues regarded his work on nuclear winter computer models to be on the extreme fringe, a position which toed the Soviet party line at the time – a position that, in private, he reportedly acknowledged was nonsense. US colleagues also pointed to his unorthodox denial by the US visa agency to permit him access to dual-use supercomputers, a denial which transpired after his name-dropping jokes about how he could freely access the coveted Cray X-MP at the US nuclear weapons lab LLNL, and a denial which is likely a key factor in how he could have possibly fallen so far from favor in the Soviet establishment. Someone from Moscow would attempt to \\"phone\\"/internet access this powerful US computer a few months before his disappearance. Upon learning of the missing-person case that had not been reported on in Madrid at the time, nuclear winter colleagues, in particular the US team that included Alan Robock, took a pact not to raise the alarm as they thought it conceivable that he had defected to the West. Robock would later regret taking this pledge as a lost opportunity to find him before the trail went cold. ==See also== *List of people who disappeared ==References== Category:1938 births Category:1980s missing person cases Category:20th-century physicists Category:Missing people Category:Missing person cases in Spain Category:Russian physicists Category:Soviet physicists Category:Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology alumni ","title":"Vladimir Alexandrov"},{"id":"7826751","text":"Madingo Kayes is an archaeological site in modern-day Republic of Congo, lying close to the town of Madingo-Kayes.

It was published anonymously in a Russian emigre magazine Listki Zhizni, a companion publication to the Zhizn (\\"Life\\") magazine.Literaturnaya entsyklopediya (Encyclopedia of Literature), Moscow, 1929-1939, article \\"International\\" The other verse was called The Proletarian Song (Песнь пролетариев), which would become quite popular. In 1903, Arkady Kots joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and carried out party assignments in Mariupol and Odessa. In 1907-1914, Kots did not belong to any political party. In 1907, a publishing house Nash Golos (Наш голос) published a collection of verses by Arkady Kots named Proletarian Songs (Песни пролетариев), which would be immediately confiscated by the tsarist authorities. Kots is known to have translated a play by Octave Mirbeau called Les Mauvais Bergers and published a number of political brochures. In 1914-1920, he sided with the Mensheviks. Evacuated to the east during the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Kots died in 1943. == References == Category:1872 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Writers from Odessa Category:People from Odessky Uyezd Category:Odessa Jews Category:Russian Social Democratic Labour Party members Category:Mensheviks Category:Jewish poets Category:Russian male poets Category:Soviet poets ","title":"Arkady Kots"},{"id":"7826853","text":"Elvis Hitler is an American psychobilly and hellbilly band from Detroit, Michigan.

Cavazzi was an indifferent student and was almost denied a position in the central African mission, but eventually prevailed thanks to his piety. He arrived in Luanda in 1654 and was dispatched to the Portuguese possessions in the eastern end of the colony. He traveled widely as a chaplain with the Portuguese Army including a stay at the court of the king of Pungo Andongo, a trip with them, in 1659 into the central highlands region, a visit in 1660 to the court of Queen Nzinga (or Njinga) in Matamba and the Kingdom of Kongo.For details of his visit, and the sources he used to rewrite his work on Kongo in later editions of Istorica Descrizioni see John Thornton, \\"New Light on Cavazzi's Seventeenth-Century Description of Kongo,\\" History in Africa 6 (1979): 253-4. He returned to Njinga's court in 1662 and remained there after the queen's death in 1663. He presided at her funeral and left Matamba in 1665, returning to Italy in 1667. He was assigned the task of writing a history of the Capuchin mission, perhaps because since 1662 or so he had been writing his own history. He worked in the archives in Italy to round out his history, but The Holy Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, which had commissioned the work was reluctant to publish it, and in fact it was not published until 1687, after Cavazzi's death. In 1673 he returned to Angola as prefect of the Capuchin mission. He returned to Italy in 1677 where he wrote a second biographical account of the Capuchin mission, which was not published until the twentieth century. He died on July 18, 1678.Biographical details are found in Giuseppe Pistone, \\"I manoscritti \`Araldi' di Padre Giovanni Antonio Cavazzi da Montecuccolo,\\" Atti e memorie, Accademia Nazionale di Scienze, Lettere e Arti di Modena 9 (1969): 152-65 ==Works== Cavazzi is famous for his descriptive history, Istorica Descrizione de' tre regni Congo, Matamba ed Angola.Bologna, 1687, 2nd edition, 1690 There were many translations, a German one in 1694 and a French one in 1732.

The character was introduced after DC Comics created Earth-Two, a parallel world that was retroactively established as the home of characters whose adventures had been published in the Golden Age of comic books. This provided justification within the fictional world of Batman stories for DC Comics publishing Batman comic books that disregarded the character's Golden Age stories, as Batman had been presented as a single ongoing incarnation of the character since his earliest stories were published. ==Publication history== Batman of Earth-Two first appeared in Justice League of America #82 and was created by Dennis O'Neil and Dick Dillin. The character history of the Earth- Two Batman accordingly adopts all of the earliest stories featuring the character from the 1930s and 1940s, while the adventures of the then- mainstream Silver Age Batman (who lived on \\"Earth-One\\") begin later in time and with certain elements of his origin retold. Each were depicted as separate, though parallel, individuals living in their respective universes, with the \\"older\\" Earth-Two character eventually reaching his retirement and death. A parallel to this character is introduced in Justice Society of America Annual #1 (2008) entitled \\"Earth-2\\" where the Post Crisis Earth-2 is fully introduced. The most notable difference between Pre-Crisis Earth-Two Wayne and his newer Post-Crisis Earth-2 incarnation is that the Post-Crisis Earth-2 Joker learned the real identities of Robin and the Huntress after turning Gotham DA Harvey Simms into the new Two-Face (Harvey knowing Helena's identity already). A new parallel to this character was introduced in the 2012 Earth-2 series who died in the first issue, protecting that world from Darkseid's forces, alongside that world's Superman and Wonder Woman. His father, Thomas Wayne, later took up the mantle to atone for earlier sins, including deceiving his son about his own death. Dick Grayson would also take up the mantle during Earth 2: Earth's End and Earth 2: Society. Helena would later don the mantle after Dick retired at the end of the Society series. ==Fictional character biography== ===Childhood and early history=== Batman's origin and history is essentially similar to the Earth-One version of the character, but events unfold in more of a real-time fashion. For example, the Batman makes his debut in 1939, meets Robin, the Joker, Catwoman and Clayface at various points in 1940, the Penguin in 1941, Two-Face in 1942, etc. These dates reflect the publishing dates of the original stories, rather than taking the Earth-One and Modern Age approach of keeping the characters eternally youthful. * Bruce Wayne was born in Gotham City circa 1915-1916. * Bruce's parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, were killed when he was eight years old by a robber named Joe Chill, in 1924. According to a later retcon, Martha died from a heart attack soon after Thomas was shot to death. * Like his Earth-One counterpart, the Earth-Two Wayne is raised by his father's brother, Phillip Wayne, though he never recovers from his parents' murder and vows to one day wage a war against the criminal underworld in Gotham City. This aspect of the Batman mythos was retconned in the Post-Crisis history established by Frank Miller's Batman: Year One, where Phillip is eliminated and Alfred largely raises Bruce. In the Golden Age and Earth-Two reality, Wayne and Alfred meet for the first time in 1943, after Batman has already met Robin (and in fact, this version of Alfred is Alfred Beagle - his originally published name which was kept for the Earth-Two distinction). * After a period of training, a young Bruce Wayne becomes Batman. His first printed story is \\"The Case of the Chemical Syndicate\\", although story content implies that this was not his first mission. * Bruce Wayne meets eight-year-old Dick Grayson, following the murder of his parents by a gangster who he overheard. Grayson eventually takes the identity of Robin. * Batman meets Superman for the first time and the two heroes soon become lifelong friends. Unlike their Post-Crisis incarnations, they get along right away and often team up over the years. Along with Kal-L, Batman participates in the Justice Society and the war-time only All-Star Squadron. * Batman dies in 1979. ===Divergence with Earth-One=== At the dawn of the Silver Age of comics, DC Comics decided to reintroduce several of their Golden Age superheroes, all of whom had ceased publication several years earlier. Flash and Green Lantern were reimagined as Barry Allen and Hal Jordan. Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman, having been continuously published since their Golden Age introductions, were not given any reimaginings (although much about the mythos of each had evolved slowly over the years). It was later revealed that the current heroes live on a parallel world to the Golden Age heroes: The newer Silver Age heroes are on \\"Earth-One\\", while the older Golden Age characters reside on \\"Earth-Two\\" (the numbering does not indicate any hierarchy of parallel Earths, only the number by which they were discovered). When Barry Allen met Jay Garrick, it meant there were two Flashes, two Green Lanterns, two Supermen and two Batmen. Unlike the Silver Age versions of the Flash and Green Lantern, who had entirely different secret identities from their Golden Age counterparts, the Batman and Superman of each world were both Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent, respectively. There is no clear demarcation between when the stories of one Batman ends and the other begins. Indeed, many stories from the 1940s and the 1950s were treated as canon to both incarnations of Batman after the concept of Earth-One and Earth-Two was established; Some stories from the mid-1950s could have only occurred on Earth-One, while some stories as late as the early-1960s seem as though they could have also occurred on Earth-Two. DC has mandated that only the Earth-One Batman wore a yellow oval around the bat symbol on his chest, making 1964 the fixed year in which all Batman stories were set on Earth-One, although there are several instances where this is contradicted in-story. The Earth-Two Wayne made several different character evolutions from the mainstream Batman, as the Earth-Two Bruce accepts his one-time adversary Catwoman as his true love and shares his secret identity with her after her memory is restored of her real life. The Earth-Two Wayne and Catwoman, Selina Kyle, later marry, after she had voluntarily served prison time for her crimes. They have a daughter, Helena Wayne, the Huntress,First appearance: and the family resides at Wayne Manor where Bruce devotes himself and his fortune to philanthropy. By the early 1960s, Wayne has retired as Batman with Robin taking over crimefighting in Gotham City. He even accepted Wayne's position in the reformed Justice Society.Justice Society (Vol 1) #55 Wayne is later called out of retirement by the ancient god, Mercury to help defeat King Kull along with other superheroes of Pre-Crisis Earth-Two, Earth-One and Earth-S. Several years after, that he again dons his costume to answer the Batsignal when Robin is away from Gotham City, but this adventure ends in tragedy as Batman's kick causes a criminal to fire his gun wildly, striking and killing Selina Wayne. Bruce burned his cape and cowl that night, swearing to never wear it again. His years of civic volunteerism results in him being named to replace the retiring James Gordon as Police Commissioner. In this capacity, Wayne is soon mind-controlled by the Psycho Pirate. Resulting in his declaring the current roster of the Justice Society of America to be outlaws and he attempts to arrest them. Once freed from the Psycho Pirate's control, Wayne clears the JSA of all trumped-up charges. Adventure Comics #462 (1979), featuring the death of Batman. Cover art by Jim Aparo. The elder Earth-Two Wayne is eventually coaxed out of retirement for one last mission as Batman when a thief named Bill Jensen is magically empowered by a sorcerer named Frederick Vaux (possibly the Earth-Two analogue to Felix Faust) and attacks Gotham City. As when he was eight, Earth- Two Wayne faces an overpowering criminal with a weapon that is greater than himself, though this time it is magical bolts rather than bullets. Already dying of cancer from his years of pipe smoking (as stated in Brave and the Bold #197), Wayne decides to fight to the death against Jensen, who bears a furious grudge against Wayne, stopping his threat at the cost of his own life. In the aftermath of the battle, the public learns that Wayne was Batman's secret identity. The Earth-Two Doctor Fate later removes the memory of the battle from the consciousness of the general public, so as to protect the secret identities of Robin and the Huntress, which were also thus exposed, and causing everyone to believe instead that Wayne died of cancer at home on the same day that Batman died. Several years after Bruce Wayne's death, Batman's diary was discovered and made public (as described in the limited series America vs. the Justice Society). In it, he charged the JSA with treason, being spies for Hitler, resulting in the team being put on trial. It is ultimately revealed that this was a hoax on Batman's part, designed to set a trap for a longtime Justice Society foe, Per Degaton. Knowing he was dying and would not be alive to combat Degaton's as yet unrevealed scheme, Wayne fabricated the treason charges so as to bring about a reexamination of the JSA's history, giving them clues as how to defeat the time traveling villain. It would prove to be the Earth Two Batman's final case, solved from the grave. Professor Zee, the scientist who had invented the Time Machine (and someone Per Degaton shot), appeared from it, which he had used to transport himself 40 years into the future, and accused Per Degaton of murder. Per Degaton then shot himself in the head. As a tribute to this version of the character, his final formal 'appearance' was in Secret Origins vol. 2, #6 (Sept. 1986) in the story \\"Secret Origins Starring the Golden Age Batman\\" by writer Roy Thomas and artists Marshall Rogers and Terry Austin, a retelling of the Earth-Two Batman's origin. In the limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Anti- Monitor destroys most universes, reducing the universe to the anti-matter universe and a single positive matter universe. Earth-Two \\"never existed\\" in this new universe's history, which retroactively removes the Earth-Two Batman from history, blending elements of his past with that of the Earth-One Batman's, effectively creating a Batman with a new fictional history. ===One Year Later=== During Infinite Crisis, senior members of the Justice Society regain some memories of Earth-Two's previous existence. One year later, when the Gentleman Ghost attacks the JSA using powers of limited control over the spirits of the dead, Jakeem Thunder and the Thunderbolt are assisted in battle by the spirits of various deceased JSA members and allies, including the Batman of Earth-Two. Although Jakeem is confused by his presence, noting that Batman is not dead, the Thunderbolt tells him not to worry about it. ===The New 52=== In September 2011, DC Comics carried out a line-wide revision to its superhero comic book series and the fictional histories of their characters, branded as \\"The New 52\\". In this revised fictional history, the Earth-2 Batman is now Thomas Wayne, father to Bruce Wayne. Wayne, a corrupt doctor, works for the Mafia in Gotham City until he fakes his own death, deceiving his son about whether he has survived. The original Batman (Bruce Wayne) discovers his father's actions and disassociates himself with Thomas. Following Bruce Wayne's death, Thomas Wayne becomes the second Batman. As Batman, Thomas Wayne uses Hourman's Miraclo pills. After Thomas Wayne sacrifices his life to prevent villains from a parallel world from entering his own, Dick Grayson becomes the new Batman.Earth 2: Society #1.

The son of Harry and Maire Gullichsen he was born into a family of industrialists, designers and artists. His siblings are the renowned Finnish philosopher Lilli Alanen and Johan Gullichsen, a professor of engineering. Kristian Gullichsen has three sons and two daughters, one of the sons is the artist Alvar Gullichsen (born 1961). Gullichsen has been married twice; his second wife is architect Kirsi Gullichsen (née Parkkinen) (born 1964). Kristian Gullichsen has been a member of the board of governors of the Alvar Aalto Academy and the committee of the Alvar Aalto Symposium. From 1988 to 1993 he held the title of Finnish State Artist Professor. ==Childhood== The Gullichsen family home was the world-famous Villa Mairea (1938–39) in Noormarkku, designed by Alvar Aalto, one of the seminal houses of 20th century modernist architecture. Kristian was seven years old when his family moved into the house in August 1939. The family was close friends of the Aalto family, and Aalto was responsible for designing the company factories and communities, as part of the company ideology of enculturation. Kristian played with the Aalto children and did odd jobs in the Aalto architects' office.Kristian Gullichsen, \\"Preface\\", in Juhani Pallasmaa (ed), Alvar Aalto, Villa Mairea 1938-39. Alvar Aalto Academy, Helsinki, 1998. ==Early career== Kristian Gullichsen studied architecture at Helsinki University of Technology, qualifying as an architect in 1960, after which he returned to the Aalto office to work as an assistant architect, before founding his own office in 1961. From 1965 to 1967 he was also Head of the Exhibitions Office of the Museum of Finnish Architecture, Helsinki. In his early career he did a number of joint works with other architects such as Kirmo Mikkola and Juhani Pallasmaa. Of such projects the most memorable historically was the so-called Moduli 225 house (1969-1971), an industrially produced prefabricated summer house, built in timber, steel and glass, influenced by Japanese house design, the teachings of his mentor, Finnish architect and professor, Aulis Blomstedt and the minimalist houses of Mies van der Rohe. Seventy of the houses were built, but few remain today because they could not withstand the Finnish climate. Kristian Gullichsen, Stockmann department store extension, Helsinki (1986) ==Mature career== In 1969 Gullichsen founded a partnership in Helsinki with architects Erkki Kairamo and Timo Vormala, Arkkitehdit KY, which continued until Kairamo's death in 1997. The three partners presented different architectural modernist styles, Gullichsen the monumental, Kairamo the constructivist and Varmola the typological. Since Kairamo's death Gullichsen and Vormala have continued together as Gullichsen Vormala Arkkitehdit. The work of the office reached international attention in the late 1970s and early 1980s, described by the British journal The Architectural Review as constituting the \\"Cool Helsinki School\\". Gullichsen's mature architecture can be seen as a late-modernist style, combining the minimalist aesthetic of pure modernism with the humanist touches and concern for locality, craftsmanship and materials derived from Aalto. ==A selection of works by Kristian Gullichsen in collaboration with Erkki Kairamo and Timo Vormala== Kristian Gullichsen, Olympos Housing, Helsinki (2000) Kristian Gullichsen, Malmi Church, Helsinki (1982) *Kauniainen Parish Centre, Helsinki (1985) *Pieksämäki Civic Centre (1990) *Stockmann Department Store Extension, Helsinki (1986) *Olympos Housing, Myllytie 6, Kaivopuisto, Helsinki (1995) *University of Lleida Library and Science Centre, Spain (2003). *Finnish Embassy, Stockholm, Sweden (2002). *Gullichsen's own summer cottage in the archipelago, Hiittinen (1994) *Malmi Church (1982) *Pori Art Museum renovation (1979-1981) ==Books on the works of Kristian Gullichsen, Erkki Kairamo and Timo Vormala== * Ilona Anhava (ed.), Theory free zone.

He was a director of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, serving from 1903 to 1930. ==Early life== Born in Wilmot House, Dalston,Chick: Sir Charles James Martin(1866–1955)’, rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2009, accessed 14 Jan 2013 Hackney, North London he was the twelfth child of Josiah (an insurance company actuary) and Elizabeth Mary Martin (née Lewis), Charles James was part of an extended family of children from his parents' previous marriages. Being a delicate child, he was sent off to a private boarding school in Hastings. At 15 he was employed as a junior clerk at the insurance firm where his father worked. He studied mathematics as a requirement for a future as actuary, but showed no special aptitude. Browsing through the numerous bookshops in the area, he came across a secondhand copy of \\"A Hundred Experiments in Chemistry for One Shilling.\\" Carrying out these experiments, he was sufficiently inspired to entreat his father to allow him to pursue a career in science. He accordingly took evening classes at King's College, London. He then studied medicine at St Thomas's Hospital and spent some time in Leipzig studying physiology under Karl Ludwig. ==Career== Sister Florence Elizabeth McMillan, Dr Anderson in the centre and Sir Charles James Martin on the right In 1891 he accepted a post as lecturer at Sydney University, before moving to the University of Melbourne as acting Professor of Physiology. He remained in Australia for 12 years, after which he returned to the UK to become the first Director of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1901. His candidacy citation read: During World War I he served with the Australian Army Medical Corps in Gallipoli, Egypt, and France as a pathologist with the rank of Lieutenant-colonel. He found some cases of enteric fever at Gallipoli were not typhoid, but paratyphoids A and B, and made a vaccine for all three. A memo to his colleagues on the different treatments for amoebic and bacillary dysentery was widely circulated by the army under Martin’s name. In France he organized the integration of decentralized pathology services into the A.A.M.C. After the war he returned to the Lister Institute until his retirement in 1930. He then spent a further two years in Australia as head of the animal nutrition division of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research in Adelaide. On his return to the UK he went to live at Roebuck House in Old Chesterton, Cambridge, which he equipped as a laboratory. During WWII it was used to rehouse the experimental animals being used for medical studies by the staff of the Lister Institute. In 1934 he undertook an experimental study of the myxoma virus, at Cambridge and on a rabbit-infested island in Pembrokeshire, to show it was both safe and effective to control plagues of rabbits. He was awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal in 1923 and delivered the Royal College of Physicians Croonian Lectures in 1930. He was knighted in 1927.

Originally of Norman French extraction, they were wealthy and well connected, and lived at ease on their handsome estate, \\"The Leap\\", at Davidstown, near Enniscorthy. They sympathized warmly with and took an aggressive part in the agitations preceding the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and on the defeat of the patriots or rebels the family was ruined.

Devereux.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 16 (Index). New York: The Encyclopedia Press, 1914. 25 July 2019 ==Life== During the agitation preceding the rebellion, John C. Devereux was obliged to fly from the country; he went first to France and afterwards to America. He landed at New York about 1797, gave dancing lessons in Connecticut, and in November 1802 opened a dry goods and grocery store in Utica, New York. Devereux was a friend of Albany shopkeeper and entrepreneur William James. His goods were of handsome quality. Devereux \\"...had energy, shrewdness, and industry; a temper most generous, a tongue that was persuasive and fluent, and manners benignant and polished.\\" He quickly became possibly the most successful and best known merchant west of Albany. His brothers Luke, Thomas, and Nicholas emigrated as well, and joined him. By 1813, Luke Devereux had opened his own store. He was successful and became wealthy; was public spirited and enterprising. Dr. Bagg in \\"The Pioneers of Utica\\" says, \\"a settler of 1802 and a very prince among his fellows was John C. Devereux whose honourable career and many deeds of charity left behind him a memory as verdant as that of the green isle whence he came\\". In 1814, his brother Nicholas, after two years working for William James in Albany, returned to Utica and partnered with John. The business prospered and became one of the most extensive in Western New York. In 1830 Mr. Devereux was appointed president of the Utica branch of the United States Bank and held the position as long as the bank existed. ===The Savings Bank of Utica=== As the Devereux brothers were successful business, many people with relatively small savings would seek their advice regarding possible investments. By 1821 a custom had developed whereby they would leave money with the brothers for safekeeping. \\"The scant savings of poorer citizens who confided in the integrity of these gentlemen were sacredly guarded and regular interest was paid on all accumulated balances.\\" Even after both had retired from active business, they retained a bookkeeper at the Devereux office at 12 Bleeker Street, to keep track of accounts. In 1839, Nicholas decided it was time to form a corporation to carry on this work. They founded the Utica Savings Bank, for which they obtained a charter. John was elected president. At first the bank was operated from Nicholas Devereux's office, a vacant shop where the corporation secretary, Stalham Williams would receive deposits. On the wall was a gauge for measuring height for the purposes of identification, and a detailed physical description of each depositor was maintained in a memorandum book. In 1868, the bank moved to new quarters on the corner of Genesee and Fayette streets.\\"The Savings Bank of Utica\\", United States Investor, Vol. 34, Part 2, Issues 27-52, September 15, 1923 The meticulous Mr. Williams, who had served as a collector on the Erie Canal, continued to serve as secretary well into his nineties. Prior to 1840, the mayor was appointed by the city council. That year, John C. Devereux became the first elected mayor of the city of Utica. He was twice married. His first wife, Miss Ellen Barry, of Albany, died in 1813. His second wife Mary, daughter of Peter Colt, of Rome, New York, survived him twenty-one years and died August 7, 1868. They had no children, but at different times adopted two: Ellen, who became the wife of Mr. Catlin, of Paterson, New Jersey, and his nephew, John C. Devereux, Jr., son of his brother Thomas. John C. Devereux, Jr. died in 1861. John Corish Devereux died at Utica, New York, on 11 December, 1848, and was buried on the grounds of the Sisters of Charity, near St. John's church. ==Philanthropy== A devout Catholic, he donated $300 to the building of the Presbyterian Church. Devereux loved his Church and its institutions, and in 1813 was a trustee of St. Mary's, Albany. Visiting missionary priests always stayed at Devereux's home, where local Catholics heard Mass on Sundays. In 1819, he and his brother Nicholas became two of the founding trustees of St. John's Church, whose congregation at that time numbered about twenty-five. However, this number was further increased by the arrival of a large number of Irish immigrants working on the Erie Canal, and who contributed from their earnings one dollar a month toward the purchase of land and erection of a building. By 1828, there were 600 parishioners. In 1843 he and Nicholas brought the Daughters of Charity of Emmitsburg, Maryland to Utica to open St. John's Female Orphan Asylum; the two Devereux brothers each gave $5,000 towards the project,Cookinham, Henry.

The station was opened as part of the first segment of the Syretsko-Pecherska Line on 31 December 1989. It serves as a transfer station to the Teatralna station of the Sviatoshynsko-Brovarska Line. It is located near the city's Golden Gate, from which the station takes its name. The original design plans for the station called for a clean utilitarian structure typical of metro stations of that period. Due to the efforts of the city's chief architect Mykola Zharikov, the design was scrapped in favor of one that resembles an ancient Kievan Rus' temple by Borys Zhezherin, Vadym Zhezherin, and Zharikov himself. Such a design was a particularly risky feat, since Ukraine was a part of the secular Soviet Union at the time of the station's construction. Vadym Zhezherin and Mykola Zharikov, among the other artists and architects of the station, were bestowed the State Prize of Ukraine in the Field of Architecture for their work in 1991. The Zoloti Vorota features 80 distinct mosaic pieces and images depicting the history of Kievan Rus'. In 2011, the station's mosaics were listed as \\"newly discovered objects of cultural heritage\\" by the city's Department of Cultural Heritage. The station is regarded as one of the most impressive metro stations in Europe, being placed on a list compiled by The Daily Telegraph in 2013. ==Construction== The initial plans for the future Syretsko-Pecherska Line called for a transfer station (named \\"Kominternivska\\") to connect with the Sviatoshynsko-Brovarska Line at Universytet station. However, the short central hall at Universytet was inadequate for the high volume of passengers that a transfer station would be subject to, thus the station's future location was moved a few city blocks to coincide with a newly proposed station of the Sviatoshynsko-Brovarska Line. This new station, called Teatralna, would be located in between the Khreshchatyk and Universytet stations, and would serve as a transfer to the future Zoloti Vorota station. Although the Kominternivska station was never built, some of its architectural designs were preserved and used in the creation of the Teatralna station. Construction for the Syretsko-Pecherska Line, the Kyiv Metro system's third line, began on 23 February 1983. It had a projected date of completion in 1986, although the line's opening was delayed until the end of 1989 due to the economic state of the Soviet Union at the time. The line's first segment was officially opened on 31 December 1989, and consisted of three stations; Zoloti Vorota–Palats Sportu–Mechnikova (named Klovska today). The station is located at a depth of , creating the need for an underground vestibule in between the two escalator tunnels. Since its entrance is located on a hillside, two separate escalator tunnels had to be created, connected by an underground station vestibule. The upper tunnel is long, while the lower tunnel is long. The vestibule was built in the same way as with other stations of the Kyiv Metro system; it was first completed at ground level, and then lowered to its final location underground. The vestibule is a tall monolithic dome with an approximately similar diameter. The installation began in November 1987 and was completed by 1988, lowered at a pace of half a meter a day. Since the construction took place in water-saturated soils, over 200 frozen wells had to be formed so it could be lowered to its proper location. In addition, over of rock had to be removed to make way for the vestibule. After it was finally installed, construction work began on the lower escalator tunnel. Due to a difficult hydrogeology, the tunnel was not completed by the station's grand opening and until 1 May 1990, it could only be reached with a transfer from the Teatralna station. For several years, the Zoloti Vorota station served as the line's northern terminus. Continued construction extended the line northwards to the Lukianivska station. In between the two stations, the Lvivska Brama station was built during the late 1990s; however, it has not been completed to this day. ==Design== The station's massive chandeliers, flanked by the ceiling's mosaic pieces From an engineering standpoint, Zoloti Vorota was built as a deep column station, at a depth of underground. It consists of three distinct vaulted halls, featuring one central hall, and two side platform halls, each separated by a row of columns. The central hall is connected to the only above-ground vestibule through two escalator tunnels, separated by an underground vestibule, which was needed because of the depth at which the station is located. Its design and formation is nearly similar to the Maidan Nezalezhnosti station of the system's Obolonsko–Teremkivska Line. The station's original plans were designed by a team of Moscow architects from Metrogiprotrans; their design was strictly utilitarian, architecturally similar to the other metro stations of that period. However, due to the socio- economic changes taking place in the country at the time, the original design was scrapped because it was considered \\"too weak\\" for one of the city's main metro stations in a historically significant location. Close-up of a light fixture in the station's underground vestibule The city's chief architect Mykola Zharikov approached Vadym Zhezherin to create a new design for the station. Zhezherin enlisted the help of his father, Borys in completing the design. Vadym previously worked on the reconstruction of the city's Leo Tolstoy Square and similarly named metro station, while his father, who was awarded the title of Distinguished Architect of Ukraine, was responsible for the reconstruction of the nearby National Opera House. They were supported by architects Anatoliy Krushynskyi, Tamara Tselikovska, and Fedir Zaremba, who were responsible for designing the underground vestibule. While the redesign was taking place, construction on the station's original utilitarian design continued. The new design was based on the form of a Kievan Rus' temple, featuring unique mosaics situated throughout the station. The central hall's height was increased, and the original design's pylons were replaced with much lower columns, finished off with white marble and matte polish. In particular, the white ceiling was divided with diametrical mosaic stripes with brick grouting on the sides, completed by artists Hryhoriy Korin and Volodymyr Fedko. The station is illuminated by two-tierd bronze chandeliers, each featuring 12 distinct lighting groups holding candle-like bulbs. The chandeliers, designed by Stanislav Adamenko and Mariya Ralko, were installed between the mosaic stripes. Both the station halls and the underground vestibule feature similar light fixtures, although they are significantly smaller than the main chandeliers. The redesign also called for a gold smalt- covered ceiling, although this was rejected as it was too expensive. To finish it off, gray granite was used on the floor. ==Mosaics== Close-up of the gold name inscription which was carried out in an ancient Rus'-style font The Zoloti Vorota station features a number of distinct mosaic decorations, which were completed by artists Hryhoriy Korin and Volodymyr Fedko. There are a total of 80 large mosaic pieces; they run in a clockwise direction around the station, depicting the history of Kievan Rus. The two artists, accompanied by the station's lead architect Vadym Zhezherin, concluded that the station should be decorated with mosaic pieces of historical significance of the period leading up to the Mongol invasion of Rus'. Korin completed the mosaics in either ends of the station and the large ceiling arches, while Fedko was completed the unique images relating to Kievan Rus' and the smaller arches in between each of the station's pillars. Four large mosaic panels are installed on either ends of the station hall and the two escalator tunnels. On the side that leads to the exit to the city, a panel was installed depicting the patron saint of Kyiv, Michael the Archangel. Meanwhile, at the very end of the station, Saint George is depicted, symbolizing Moscow, the Soviet Union's capital at the time. One of the mosaic panels at the end of the station near the escalators includes an inscription featuring a Ukrainian nationalist slogan, stating СЛАВА УКРАЇНІ, which is translated as Glory to Ukraine. A large portion of the station's mosaics depict the various Grand Princes of Kievan Rus', of which 27 are depicted. The mosaic pieces themselves incorporate the princes' years of reigning and their names: * Kyi * Shchek * Khoryv * Lybid * Askold * Dir * Oleg of Novgorod * Igor of Kiev * Olga of Kiev * Sviatoslav I of Kiev * Vladimir the Great * Yaroslav the Wise * Iziaslav I of Kiev * Vsevolod I of Kiev * Sviatopolk II of Kiev * Vladimir II Monomakh * Mstislav I of Kiev * Yaropolk II of Kiev * Vsevolod II of Kiev * Iziaslav II of Kiev * Rostislav I of Kiev * Roman I of Kiev * Sviatoslav III of Kiev * Rurik Rostislavich * Mstislav III of Kiev * Vladimir IV Rurikovich * Daniel of Galicia The station also has nine mosaics depicting various other important personalities of the Kievan Rus' era featuring Anthony, Theodosius, Anne, Hilarion, Agapetus, Alypius, Nestor the Chronicler, Petro Mylonig, and Sylvester. Eight of the mosaic pieces depict Kyiv's ancient Rus' churches including the Church of the Tithes, the Saint Sophia Cathedral, Iryninska Church, St. Michael's Golden-Domed Cathedral, Church of the Saviour at Berestove, Dormition Cathedral, Church of the Mother of God Pyrohoshchya, and the St. Cyril's Monastery. Lastly, there are 32 mosaic pieces featuring simargls, which are mythical creatures in East Slavic mythology, often depicted as a winged lion or dog. ==Service== The Zoloti Vorota station has only two street entrances, one of which is located on Volodymyrska Street, and the other on Zoloti Vorota Passage. Each of the entrances are connected by a single vestibule in the city center near the Golden Gate, and Ukraine's National Opera building. , the Zoloti Vorota station has a daily ridership of 20,000. The station itself is operational every day from 05:39 to 00:06, while the transfer tunnel which connects Zoloti Vorota to Teatralna is open from 05:45 to 00:32. The station features six escalators, with the upper and lower vestibules both having two operating escalators, with an additional backup escalator. The commute from Zoloti Vorota to the line's terminus at Syrets takes approximately 9 minutes and 5 seconds, while it takes 30 minutes and 55 seconds to commute to the Chervony Khutir terminus. The train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 2–13 minutes in either direction. The morning's first eastbound train departs from the station at 05:48, while the westbound train departs at 06:01. The evening's last eastbound departs at 00:15, while the westbound train departs at 00:30. The entire Kyiv Metro system uses the same methods of payment for transit via each station; plastic tokens, temporary paper contactless cards, and reloadable plastic contactless cards. In June 2015, the station was outfitted with Paypass functionality, a contactless payment service from MasterCard. It is one of seventeen strategic stations of the metro system to use this technology, making Kyiv the fifth rapid transit system in the world to incorporate this technology. ==References== Notes Footnotes ==External links== * * * Category:Kiev Metro stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1989 Category:Volodymyrska Street ","title":"Zoloti Vorota (Kyiv Metro)"},{"id":"7827226","text":"Blanche Ring (April 24, 1871 - January 13, 1961) was an American singer and actress in Broadway theatre productions, musicals, and Hollywood motion pictures. She was best known for her rendition of \\"In the Good Old Summer Time.\\" ==Early life and family== Blanche Ring was born in Boston, Massachusetts to James H. Ring and Wilhelmena F. Ring. She came from show business stock. Her father was a comedian for 30 years and her grandfather James H. Ring, was a leading comedian of the Boston Museum company. Her great- great-grandfather, Charles Fisher, was also an actor and came to the United States from England. He journeyed with theatrical caravans as far west as the Mississippi River. Her heritage was English-Irish-Scottish. In total, four generations of her ancestors were Shakespearean actors. Blanche was one of 5 daughters and one son born to the Rings. Several of Blanche's siblings were in the entertainment business and quickly became recognizable names in the industry. In fact, they often performed together or on the same playbill. Two of the Ring sisters, Grace and Sarah, were not performers. Blanche's sister Julie Ring (1878–19??) became a stage actress. She married Albert H. Sutherland, a theatrical agent and former British actor. They had a son, A. Edward Sutherland, who became a film director in the United States. Her sister Frances Ring (July 4, 1882 – January 15, 1951)Who Was Who in the Theatre: 1912-1976 Gale Research (compilation of John Parker's Who's Who in the Theatre series originally published annually) Frances Ring Meighan, findagrave.com Retrieved August 7, 2017 was married in 1909 to Thomas Meighan, the popular stage and later silent film actor. The Ring sisters' younger brother, Cyril \\"Cy\\" Ring, was a freelance actor. He was the first husband of actress Charlotte Greenwood (1916–1922). He later married Ziegfeld Follies girl Molly Green in 1923; they had two daughters. ==Theater== In The Good Old Summer Time - Cover - Blanche Ring ===Musicals=== Miss Ring made her debut at age 16 in A Parisian Romance in 1887 with Shakespearean actor Richard Mansfield's theatrical company. Later she acted with Nat Goodwin and Chauncey Olcott. Her version of \\"In the Good Old Summertime\\" in 1902 was an instant hit. She followed this with another hit song \\"The Belle of Avenue A\\", performed in Tommy Rot, which was staged at Mrs. Osborn's Playhouse in New York City. Ring left the US for a tour of Europe including London, returning to America in 1904 where she became even more established as a favorite performer appearing at three notable venues belonging to vaudeville impresario F.F. Proctor including Proctor's Twenty-third Street Theater, Newark Theater and Fifth Avenue Theater. \\"I've Got Rings On My Fingers\\" was introduced when Blanche performed in The Midnight Sons in 1909. Her recording of the song for Victor Records is listed as one of Billboard's top hits of that year, along with her recordings of \\"Yip-I-Addy-I-Aye\\" and \\"The Billiken Man.\\" Will Rogers spoke his first lines on stage in Ring's play The Wall Street Girl. In 1910, she recorded \\"Come Josephine in My Flying Machine\\" after introducing it in a Broadway show, and the song became one of her biggest hits. Among her other songs of note are \\"Bedelia\\" and \\"I'd Leave My Happy Home for You\\". The former was featured in The Jersey Lilly. During World War I, the singer was popular with \\"They're All Out of Step But Jim\\". Blanche Ring possessed a talent for mime. This helped her advance in musical revues and she was billed as \\"America's Favorite Singing Comedienne\\" as of 1918. Her impersonations were paired with those of Charles Winninger in the Passing Show of 1919, performed at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York City. ====1930s==== Ring appeared as Mrs. Grace Draper in Strike Up the Band (1930) and she played Josie Huggins inRight This Way (1938). ===Dramas=== On the dramatic stage she appeared in Cradle Snatchers and as Mrs. Hawthorne in The Great Necker (1928). Her final stage performance was in her role as Rose Bertin in Madame Capet (1938); the production starred Eva Le Gallienne. ==Film== Ring went to Hollywood in 1916 to star in the silent film The Yankee Girl. She has a brief role in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. She acted in the motion picture It's the Old Army Game (directed by her nephew Eddie Sutherland) with W.C. Fields in 1926. In 1940, Ring appeared as one of the featured vaudeville greats in the Bing Crosby picture, If I Had My Way (1940). ==Personal life== ===Marriages=== The singer's personal life was tumultuous and not without scandal. In all, Blanche Ring was married five times and by her own admission she separated from several of her husbands for various reasons. All of Ring's marriages ended in divorce. * Walter F. MacNichol - Ring had one son, Gordon Eliot MacNichol, by her first marriage to MacNichol, a theatrical manager. * James Walker Jr. - Ring separated from Walker in 1898 and the couple divorced in 1904. Walker was from Somerville, Massachusetts and worked for the railroad. * Edward Wentworth * Frederick Edward McKay, her theatrical manager * Charles Winninger - Ring first met Winninger a fellow actor in 1908 and they later appeared in \\"Broadway Whirl\\" together. The couple married in 1912 when Ring was 41. The couple separated in 1928; Winninger and Ring were not formally divorced until 1951. In the summer, Ring gravitated to nearby Westchester County for golf and the beaches. She liked to entertain fellow thespians and was known for throwing house parties attended by the likes of Douglas Fairbanks and Eddie Foy Sr.. At one time, Ring shared a home in Rye, New York with Winninger at 30 Oakland Beach Avenue where she remained until at least 1935. Previous to living in Rye, Ring had a country home in Mamaroneck across from the actress Ethel Barrymore and another in Larchmont at 28 Oak Avenue. Ring left New York in 1959 to live in Hollywood with her brother, Cyril. In May 1960 she attended a reunion of former Ziegfeld Follies girls. Blanche Ring was an honorary member of the Ziegfeld Club, though she never worked for Flo Ziegfeld. ===Legacy=== Blanche Ring died in a nursing home in Santa Monica, California in 1961, aged 89.

Its architecture, based on multiple software agents, supports decision-making teams by anticipating information relevant to their decisions based on a shared mental model about the context of decision making. ==Principles of design== In this digital information age, decision-making teams are often flooded with an overwhelming amount of information. This leads to two challenges: * First, a human decision maker can be overloaded with information and have difficulty making good decisions in a timely manner. * Second, members of a team may have difficulty determining what information a teammate actually needs, and hence what information needs to be shared with him/her. The R-CAST technology aims to address both of these challenges. The R-CAST approach is based on four major concepts: # Agents use a model of human decision making process (called recognition primed decision [RPD] model) to link decision-making tasks to information relevant to the decisions. # The computational RPD model in R-CAST uses a knowledge structure (called experience knowledge) that captures knowledge relevant to decision-making. # Three types of relevant information can be anticipated from experience knowledge and inference rules, relating to: ## matching current situation to known experience (i.e., cues), ## evaluating multiple decision options, and ## detecting anomalies after a decision is made so that the original decision can be modified accordingly. # The computational RPD model serves as a shared DM process between agents and human in a team, which enables agents to share relevant information to other teammates, whether they are software agents or human. ==Principles of operation== In addition to anticipating information needed for decision makings, R-CAST agents also collaborate to seek and fuse information in a distributed environment such as Service-oriented architecture. R-CAST is developed at the Intelligent Agents Laboratory in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Pennsylvania State University, led by Dr. John Yen. The R-CAST architecture is component-based and reconfigurable. By selecting components suitable for an application, R-CAST can be configured into a wide range of agents: from simple reflex agents to RPD-enabled agents. Key components of R-CAST include the RPD model interpreter, the knowledge base, the information manager, the process manager, the communication manager, and adapters for various domains. The RPD model interpreter matches the current situation with known experiences, which are organized into a hierarchy. Missing cues relevant to the current decision are identified. The information manager uses the information dependency in the knowledge base to infer missing information that is relevant to the higher- level cues, option evaluations, and anomalies. The communication manager then contact agents that provide the missing information. To build a model, one has to (a) determine what components are involved to compose the model, (b) analyze tasks and elicit relevant knowledge for the components, and (c) develop domain adapter to integrate agents to the external environment. R-CAST agents have been used to develop decision-making aids for human teams. They have also be used to study team cognition and issues related to human-agent collaboration in time-stressed application domains. ==Publications== * Xiaocong Fan, Bingjun Sun, Shuang Sun, Michael McNeese, and John Yen, RPD- Enabled Agents Teaming with Humans for Multi-Context Decision Making, AAMAS 2006 * X.

It is also known by the title The Fable of Arachne. It is usually regarded as a late work by the artist, dating from around 1657. Traditionally, it was believed that the painting depicted women workers in the tapestry workshop of Santa Isabel. In 1948, however, Diego Angula observed that the iconography suggested Ovid's Fable of Arachne, the story of the mortal Arachne who dared to challenge the goddess Athena to a weaving competition and, on winning the contest, was turned into a spider by the jealous goddess. This is now generally accepted as the correct interpretation of the painting. The painting as previously displayed before additions not by Velázquez were masked from view It was painted for Don Pedro de Arce, huntsman to King Philip IV. It entered the Spanish royal collection in the eighteenth century, and was probably damaged by the fire at the Royal Alcazar of Madrid in 1734. New sections were added at the sides (37 cm in total) and over 50 cm to the top of the canvas. The painting remains at the extended size but is currently (in November 2013) displayed behind a screen with a frame added over a cut-away section revealing only the original dimensions. Stylistic elements, such as the lightness, the economical use of paint, and the clear influence of the Italian Baroque, have led many scholars to assert that it was painted in 1657. Others place it earlier, at some time between 1644–50, perhaps because certain aspects of its form and content recall the bodegones Velázquez painted in his early career. In Las Hilanderas, Velázquez developed a layered composition, an approach he had often used in his earlier bodegones, such as the Kitchen Scene with Christ in the House of Martha and Mary. In the foreground is the contest. The goddess Athena, disguised as an old woman, is on the left and Arachne, in a white top facing away from the viewer, is on the right. Three helpers assist them. In the background, a raised platform (perhaps a stage) displays the finished tapestries. The one visible to us is Arachne's, showing The Rape of Europa — another Greek myth. This is in fact a copy of Titian's painting of the subject, which was in the Spanish royal collection. The painting has been interpreted as an allegory of the arts and even as a commentary on the range of creative endeavor, with the fine arts represented by the goddess and the crafts represented by Arachne. Others think that Velázquez' message was simply that to create great works of art, both great creativity and hard technical work are required. Other scholars have read political allegories into the work and interpreted it through popular culture.

He is most notable for his participation in the Gowrie conspiracy of 1600. ==Early life== Ruthven was born in Perth, the third son of William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie, and his wife Dorothea Stewart. He was educated at Perth grammar school, and later at the University of Edinburgh. ==Gowrie conspiracy== Ruthven was, with his brother John Ruthven, responsible for an attempt to kidnap or murder King James in August 1600. He lured the king to Gowrie House, where he attempted to confine him in a corner turret while his brother distracted members of the king's retinue. However, the king was able to call for help, and both Alexander and John Ruthven were killed by members of the king's party. While opponents of the king were of the belief that James had fabricated the conspiracy to cover his eradication of the Ruthven family, most modern scholarship agrees that the brothers concocted a plot to kidnap the monarch. ==Aftermath== Following his death, Alexander was condemned for treason, and hanged and quartered in Edinburgh on 17 November 1600. His head remained exposed in that city, while his arms and legs were taken to Perth. ==Notes== ==References== * Category:1580 births Category:1600 deaths Category:1600 in Scotland Category:People executed by the Kingdom of Scotland by hanging, drawing and quartering Category:People from Perth, Scotland Category:Younger sons of earls Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Executed Scottish people ","title":"Alexander Ruthven"},{"id":"7827404","text":"Maria Thins (c. 1593 – 27 December 1680) was the mother-in-law of Johannes Vermeer and a member of the Gouda Thins family.In the Great or Saint John Church in Gouda there is a stained glass window donated by her ancestors. ==Life== Maria was born in Gouda. In 1622 she married Reynier Bolnes, a prominent and prosperous brickmaker. In 1635 the marriage deteriorated; her sister found her crying in bed after her husband had beaten her. The couple moved to another house, where Wouter Crabeth had lived. There Bolnes had his dinner in the front room, together with his son, while he refused to talk to her and slept in a room upstairs. At one time her daughter Cornelia was locked up by her father and in 1641 Maria Thins decided to move to Delft, where her brother lived. Her husband refused to divorce her, but in 1649 she received a considerable sum of money from him. Her daughter Cornelia died in 1643. In 1653, Maria Thins' daughter Catharina married Johannes Vermeer in Schipluiden but it is not exactly known when the couple moved in at her rather spacious house on Oude Langendijk. Vermeer had his atelier on the front side of the second floor. Dirck van Baburen, The Procuress, 1622, oil on canvas, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The painting was owned by Maria Thins, mother-in-law of Johannes Vermeer, who reproduced it within two of his own paintings.In the catalogue of Essentian Vermeer (click on the woman in black) Maria Thins apparently played an important role in their life. She was a devotee of the Jesuit order in the nearby Catholic Church, and this seems to have influenced Johannes and Catharina too. Their third son was called Ignatius, after the founder of the Jesuit Order.Bailey, Anthony, Vermeer: A View of Delft, p. 63. Macmillan, 2002. . It is not known if the children were baptized in the Catholic Church, because baptismal records from that period are no longer extant. In 1664 her son Willem, a jobless bachelor, was locked up in an institution after an argument with his mother, and for attacking his pregnant sister with a stick. In 1665 Maria Thins was entrusted with her son's property. She was not required by law to limit his share to the legal minimum, but she mentioned that he had been calling her names since his youth.J.M. Montias (1989) Vermeer and his milieu, p. 160–169. In 1672 Maria Thins got into financial difficulties: her land near Schoonhoven was flooded to prevent the French army crossing the Dutch Water Line. In 1675 Vermeer went on several business trips for his mother-in-law, first to Gouda, when her husband had died, and then to Amsterdam. There Vermeer borrowed money by fraudulently using her name.J.M. Montias, p. 210–212. Shortly thereafter Vermeer suffered what was referred to as a \\"frenzy\\", in the words of his wife, from which he died. She attributed this to stress caused by all their financial difficulties. After Vermeer's death, Maria Thins stated that she used her income to help support the struggling painter and his growing family. For her help she received The Art of Painting, one of the finest, most mysterious and famous paintings in the history of Western Art. In 1676 she lived in the Hague but moved back to Delft where, upon her death, she was buried in the Protestant Old Church on 27 December 1680, next to Vermeer and her son Willem. The burial record states that she died as the widow of Rijnier Bolnes. Her daughter Catharina moved to Breda. Catharina Bollenes (Bolnes) received \\"Holy Oil\\", according to the records of the Roman Catholic parish of St Joseph, before being buried on 30 December 1687. ==References== ==External links== * http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-17942747.html * http://www.vermeerscamera.co.uk/reply4.htm * http://www.bergerfoundation.ch/ Category:Johannes Vermeer Category:People from Delft Category:People from Gouda, South Holland Category:1680 deaths Category:1590s births Category:Dutch Roman Catholics ","title":"Maria Thins"}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:4,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=4}}},I={class:"card-container"};function R(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Life Quotes🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",I,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const D=d(H,[["render",R]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/10.md","filePath":"drive/10.md"}'),L={name:"drive/10.md"},x=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{E as __pageData,x as default};
