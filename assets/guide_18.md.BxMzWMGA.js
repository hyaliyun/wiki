He was also a socialist and an Irish republican. Born into the literary Behan family (brother being Brendan Behan), Dominic Behan was one of the most influential Irish songwriters of the 20th-century. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Behan was born in inner-city Dublin into an educated working- class family. His father, Stephen Behan, fought for the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in the Anglo-Irish War. Dominic was the brother of Brendan Behan. His mother, Kathleen, a collector of songs and stories, took the boys on literary tours of the city. Behan's maternal uncle, Peadar Kearney, wrote \\"A Soldier's Song\\", the song the Irish National Anthem was based on. Another brother, Brian was also a playwright and writer. At the age of thirteen, Dominic left school to follow in his father's footsteps in the housepainting business. The family house in which Behan lived was the property of Christine English, Dominic's grandmother, who owned several properties in the city. His father Stephen was a member of the IRA and had been one of Michael Collins' \\"Twelve Apostles\\", who were responsible for the deaths of several officers from the British Army during the Irish War of Independence. He was banned from a professional future career for refusing to swear allegiance to the British Crown during the war of independence. ===Republican and political activities=== In 1937, the family moved to a new local council housing scheme in Crumlin. Here, Behan became a member of Fianna Éireann, the youth organisation of the IRA and published his first poems and prose in the organisation's magazine Fianna: the Voice of Young Ireland. In 1952, Behan was arrested in Dublin for leading a civil disobedience campaign in protest against the ruling government's failure to tackle unemployment and other critical economic issues. Behan was subsequently jailed for his part in other campaigns protesting the government's treatment of the working class in Ireland. ===Behan the writer=== On release from jail, Behan moved to Scotland for a time, living with the Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid in the South-side of Glasgow; Behan always credited MacDiarmid with much of his early development as a writer, coming to view verse as a more agile medium for his thoughts at that time – it would only be some years later that Behan would write his first play. Whilst living with MacDiarmid, Behan became involved in what is now known as the \\"Scottish Republican Army\\", channelling arms from the IRA with whom he had historical links to the SRA. It was during this time that Behan met his future wife, Josephine Quinn, the daughter of John Quinn, a cabinet maker and part-time journalist from Glasgow, and Bridget Quinn who ran a safe house for various revolutionary organisations. It was in Bridget Quinn's house that Behan was first introduced to Josephine Quinn, who married Behan in 1955. Behan migrated to London, where he found work with the BBC, writing radio scripts, mainly for the Third Programme. His play Posterity Be Damned, produced in the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, in 1959, dealt with republican activity after the Civil War of 1922–23. An autobiographical novel Teems of Times (1961) was received to critical acclaim, (particularly from the Observer theatre critic Kenneth Tynan, who was uncharacteristically effusive in his praise); the book was subsequently dramatised for television in 1977 by RTÉ. His autobiography, Tell Dublin I Miss Her, was also published in 1961 and sold well in the USA. A biography of his brother entitled My Brother Brendan appeared in 1965, but due to a legal wrangle Behan received virtually none of the proceeds of this book. During the 1960s and 1970s Behan wrote almost 20 television plays for British television in showcases such as Play for Today and Armchair Theatre. One of these plays, The Folk Singer (1972) – a story that focused on the sectarian roots of the Northern Ireland conflict, was restructured for the theatre and presented during the height of the Troubles at Belfast's Lyric Theatre starring a young Scottish actor Ken Stott. Also during the late sixties and into the early 1970s, along with writing many TV plays, poems and songs, Behan worked with the leadership of the Official IRA to raise funds (mostly raised during extended lecture tours in the United States) to establish a permanent summer school in Mornington (Co. Meath) the aim of which was to bring Protestant and Catholic working class youths together in an adventure setting intended to break down sectarian barriers by fostering team work. The school ran courses every year through most of the 1970s and was a tribute to Behan's belief that the troubles in Northern Ireland would be resolved only by dialogue and respect. Behan was a self-educated man whose intellect was such that he numbered many respected thinkers among his friends including the likes of Hugh MacDiarmid the Scots poet with whom he lived for three years, Louis MacNeice who became for a time a writing partner – mostly for the BBC overseas program and H. A. L. Craig the screenwriter who produced the script for the film Waterloo. Behan also found time to work in education, having been identified by the Strathclyde Region education dept as the \\"Writer in residence\\" for the Region's secondary schools. Behan enjoyed this role for more than five years, Behan always expressed a conviction that the youth were worth investing in and the role with Strathclyde Region allowed him to reach out and help aspiring talent get recognition and encouragement. Through relationships with various people in the music industry including Phil Solomon (one of the owners of Radio Caroline), Behan found himself to be often involved in helping performing artists (e.g. The Dubliners, David McWilliams, Christy Moore and many others) to develop their acts, establish an appreciation of stage craft and (especially so in the case of The Dubliners) write material. In this way, Behan made some long-lasting friendships that spanned musical genres and included friendships with Eric Burdon, Jimi Hendrix, Chas Chandler and many other artists. ===Songwriting=== Arguably, it was as a songwriter that Behan excelled. He was a prolific composer and had more than 450 songs published during his lifetime, though undoubtedly wrote many more. Many of his songs were very popular in Ireland and among the Irish living in Britain and elsewhere, especially \\"The Patriot Game\\", \\"McAlpine's Fusiliers\\" (originally written by Martin Henry but adapted by Behan), \\"Avondale\\", and \\"Liverpool Lou\\". In 1958, he released The Singing Streets: Childhood Memories of Ireland and Scotland on Folkways Records along with fellow folksinger Ewan MacColl with whom he collaborated for a number of years. Behan, who was unequivocal in the defence of his copyright, publicly accused Bob Dylan of plagiarizing \\"The Patriot Game\\" in writing his own \\"With God on Our Side\\". In 2009 The Patriot Game from Easter Week and After: Songs of the IRA originally issued by Topic in 1960 was included in their 70-year anniversary boxed set Three Score and Ten as track twenty-two on the third CD. ===Pop culture references=== Dave Cousins of the band Strawbs wrote his song \\"Josephine, for Better or for Worse\\" in honour of Josephine and Dominic Behan. This song has been recorded several times; the best-known version is on the album Dragonfly by Strawbs in 1970. Bob Dylan's 1963 song \\"With God on our Side\\" uses the melody and narrative framework of Behan's \\"The Patriot Game\\", as well as being influenced by its theme. The melody, as Behan admitted during a correspondence in The Guardian with Michael Grosvenor Myer, was actually derived and adapted from a version of the traditional song known as \\"The Nightingale\\", \\"The Grenadier and the Lady\\", \\"The Month of May\\", though had been significantly changed in both tempo and mood to serve the narrative of the song the Patriot Game. The Liverpool folk/poetry band The Scaffold produced a version of Behan's song \\"Liverpool Lou\\" in 1974 which became a top 10 hit in the UK and spawned covers in various languages across Europe. On the original Scaffold pressing, the writing credits were incorrectly attributed to Paul McCartney who had produced the record on behalf of his brother Mike McGear; Behan advised the relevant authorities and had his rights to the song reinstated quickly receiving an apology from McCartney; Behan accepted McCartney's explanation that his mother had sung the song and he thought it was a traditional work. Later pressings of the song were then correctly credited to Behan; the early McCartney-labeled pressings are particularly rare and collectible. In a well-publicised interview, John Lennon dismissed the 1960s folk scene in his own country, describing it as \\"College students with pints of beer going hay-nonny nonny\\" but in the same breath, he praised Behan, from neighbouring Ireland, whom he said he liked.\\"Power To the People\\", John Lennon and Yoko Ono talk to Robin Blackburn and Tariq Ali for their underground magazine \\"Red Mole\\", 21 January 1971. On Desert Island Discs in 2007, Yoko Ono selected Behan's \\"Liverpool Lou\\" as her husband had sung it to their son as a lullaby.Yoko Ono on Desert Island Discs, 10 June 2007. Behan is discussed briefly in Bob Dylan's documentary film Dont Look Back but it is clear that the enmity between them was palpable. Behan held a number of artists in contempt, particularly when they changed the lyrics of his works to mitigate political embarrassment; for example Behan had a well-publicised spat with Liam Clancy whose recording of \\"The Patriot Game\\" omitted the verse in which Behan blamed Éamon de Valera for the long-term unrest in the six counties of Northern Ireland. Behan took the view that almost all of his work was written to make some form of social, historical or political statement and should either be used as an entire piece of work or not at all. The relationship between Behan and Clancy was never repaired. ===Behan's death=== Dominic Behan died at home in Glasgow, aged 60, on 3 August 1989 of complications arising from pancreatic cancer, shortly after the publication of his critically acclaimed novel The Public World of Parable Jones. He was survived by his widow Josephine and two sons, Fintan and Stephen. He was cremated in Glasgow and his ashes were scattered at the Royal Canal Dublin, near his birthplace, by May MacGiolla the wife of the Workers' Party of Ireland Dublin West TD Tomás MacGiolla. His oration was given by his lifelong friend Seán Garland, general secretary of the Workers' Party of which Behan had been a staunch supporter for many years. ==Works== ===Plays=== *Posterity Be Damned (1959) *The Folk Singer (1969) *Ireland Mother Ireland (1969) *Tell Dublin I Miss Her (1998) ===Books=== *Teems of Times (1961) *Tell Dublin I Miss Her (1961) *My Brother Brendan (1965) *Ireland Sings!

It may have occurred for a variety of reasons, such as a sharp drop or corner in a straight road, so oncoming traffic is concealed, a hidden junction on a fast road, poor or concealed warning signs at a cross-roads. For some decades treatment of accident blackspots (e.g. by signage, speed restrictions, improving sightlines, straightening bends, or speed cameras) was a mainstay of road safety policy, but current thinking has it that the benefits of these interventions are often overstated. Effects such as regression to the mean,UCL and PA Consulting Group for Department for Transport UK national safety camera programme - Four-year evaluation report December 2005 Appendix H describes the effects of RTM risk compensation and accident migration combine to reduce the overall benefit. In some cases it has been claimed that the end result is an increase in overall casualties. In one notable experiment, a number of accident blackspots were \\"treated\\" with a null treatment—placement of a garden gnome, according to some reports. Accident rates at these points were found to have decreased significantly in the following period, a finding which is taken as clear evidence supporting the theory of regression to the mean. ==See also== * Black Spot Program ==References== *Discussion of accident blackspots URL is invalid ==Footnotes== Category:Road safety pl:Czarny punkt ","title":"Accident blackspot"},{"id":"3239333","text":"Lalbenque is a commune in the Lot department in south-western France. ==See also== *Communes of the Lot department Category:Communes of Lot (department) Category:Quercy ","title":"Lalbenque"},{"id":"3239334","text":"The churchyard of Vepriai, Lithuania In Christian countries a churchyard is a patch of land adjoining or surrounding a church, which is usually owned by the relevant church or local parish itself. In the Scots language and in Scottish English this can also be known as a kirkyard. While churchyards can be any patch of land on church grounds, historically, they were often used as graveyards (burial places). CHURCHYARD ADJACENT TO St.MARY'S FORANE CHURCH, KORATTY. ==Use of churchyards as a place of burial== Russian Orthodox Church and churchyard in Alaska A Baptist church and churchyard in Ohio After the establishment of the parish as the centre of the Christian spiritual life, the possession of a cemetery, as well as the baptismal font, was a mark of parochial status. During the Middle Ages, religious orders also constructed cemeteries around their churches. Thus, the most common use of churchyards was as a consecrated burial ground known as a graveyard. Graveyards were usually established at the same time as the building of the relevant place of worship (which can date back to the 6th to 14th centuries) and were often used by those families who could not afford to be buried inside or beneath the place of worship itself. However, many churchyards in Northwestern France and in the UK may predate the establishment of the Christian church there today. For example, existence of the Fortingall Yew, an ancient tree (Taxus baccata) in the churchyard of Fortingall, a village in Perthshire, Scotland, has been used to suggest pre-Christian activity on the site, although yews are difficult to date exactly. Most headstones and other memorials are of the 17th century at the earliest, as ground would often be reused for further burials and only some families could afford any memorials. The use of churchyards as burial grounds for the deceased was diminished all over Europe in various stages between the 18th to 19th centuries due to lack of space for new headstones. In many European states, burial in churchyards was outlawed altogether either by royal decrees or government legislation for public hygiene reasons and portions of churchyards were taken in order for roads to be built or expanded. The loss of part (or all) of the churchyard, often led also to the removal and permanent loss of centuries-old graves and headstones. In some cases the human remains were exhumed and the gravestones transferred. In other cases, all headstones have been removed, to create a park-like environment, or simply to facilitate the seasonal cutting and removal of grass or weeds. In at least one case in the United States, the headstones from a churchyard in Pittsburgh were used to help form the foundation for an addition to the church fifty years after the last burial in the churchyard took place (the foundation itself unknowingly went through fifteen graves), with the churchyard itself becoming a parking lot nearly forty years after that; the churchyard was largely forgotten until PennDOT purchased the church property via eminent domain for construction of Interstate 279 and subsequently unearthed 727 graves. Some churchyards across the world are still used as graveyards today, particularly in most hamlets and small towns. Public cemeteries are primarily seen in major towns and cities. ==Ecology== The Fortingall Yew in June 2011. This ancient evergreen has been posited as a sacred tree.

The NOF instead looked to Italy as its model, and based itself wholly on Mussolini's National Fascist Party. In this respect it differed markedly from its chief rival Vlajka, which was firmly in the Hitler camp. Groups targeted by the NOF for criticism included the Jews, communists, the Czechoslovak government and the Magyars. It set up a youth group and a trade union movement, although the latter was minor. The group also advocated a policy of Pan-Slavism, and hoped to take a joint lead with Poland of a grand Slavic alliance that would overthrow communism in the Soviet Union. They also believed in a corporatist economy with a large agricultural sector. The NOF attracted some early support from veterans of the Czechoslovak Legions.Andrew C. Janos, East Central Europe in the modern world: the politics of the borderlands, Stanford University Press, 2002, p. 170 It was estimated by a government informer that the NOF had as many as 200,000 followers in 1926, although it had virtually no support in the Slovak area as the far right there was dominated by an indigenous movement. ==Activity== Badge of the National Fascist Community with official party motto. The NOF regularly indulged in street-fighting tactics, clashing frequently with the National Labour Party, a moderate left-wing party led by Jaroslav Stránský.

He first proposed modeling the effective interaction between nucleons in nuclei by a zero-range potential, an idea still widely used today in nuclear structure and in equation of state for neutron stars. However, he is best known for formulating the first topological soliton to model a particle, the skyrmion. Some of his most important work can be found in selected papers.Brown, G. E. (ed.) (1994) Selected Papers, with Commentary, of Tony Hilton Royle Skyrme. World Scientific Series in 20th Century Physics: Volume 3. Skyrme was awarded the Hughes Medal by the Royal Society in 1985. ==Life== Tony Skyrme was born in Lewisham, London, the child of a bank clerk. He attended a boarding school in Lewisham and then won a scholarship to Eton public school. He excelled at mathematics and won several prizes in the subject at the school. He went on to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he again excelled, he passed part one of the mathematical tripos as a wrangler in 1942, and part three in 1943 with a first class degree. While there he was president of The Archimedeans mathematics society.R. H. Dalitz, ‘An outline of the life and work of Tony Skyrme’, International Journal of Modern Physics, A, 3 (1988), 2719–44 · The Times (3 July 1987) · CGPLA Eng. & Wales (1987) Rudolf Peierls, ‘Skyrme, Tony Hilton Royle (1922–1987)’, rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2007 50 Visions of Mathematics Ed by Dara O Briain, Chapter 10, page 38 by Alan Champneys, Tony Hilton Royle Skyrme, OUP Oxford, 2014, With World War Two at its height after graduation he was drafted into war work as a mathematician under Rudolf Peierls who was leading a team working on the theoretical aspects of atomic energy, particularly as applied to atomic weapons. At the end of 1943 Peierls and several other of the British scientists working on the atom, were transferred to the United States to assist in the Manhattan project to build a nuclear weapon. Skyrme followed later in 1944, and worked on problems concerning the diffusion plant for isotope separation. He also used IBM punch card tabulators to calculate the implosions needed to detonate a plutonium bomb. His war time work earned him a fellowship at Oxford. But he followed Peierls to the University of Birmingham where he became a research fellow. The academic years 1948–9 and 1949–50 were spent at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, respectively. In 1949 he married Dorothy Mildred a lecturer in experimental nuclear physics who he met at Birmingham University. Their marriage had no children. Returning to Britain both he and Dorothy gained posts at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell from 1950 to 1962. From 1954 he was head of the group there for theoretical nuclear physics, in which among others John Bell worked. Here he made two pioneering contributions to nuclear physics. One was to show how to handle short-range forces in a three-body problem. The other was a powerful approximation to nuclear forces, later widely used as the ‘Skyrme model’. In 1962 he proposed a mathematical treatment of fundamental particles, in which particles such as neutrons and protons, that obey the Pauli exclusion principle, appear as manifestations of fields such as that of mesons. These entities would later in 1982 became known as Skyrmions. For this work Skyrme was awarded the Hughes medal of the Royal Society in 1985 but never received the full accolade of a fellowship there. In 1958/59 he had travelled with his wife as tourists in a one-year overland circumnavigation of the globe by car and land rover. They fell in love with the lush tropical gardens of Malaysia and decided to settle there. In 1962 they left Harwell and Skyrme took up a post in the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur. He found this involved heavy lecturing commitments and was less than stimulating to his research work and by 1964 had returned to Britain to a post as professor of Mathematical Physics at the University of Birmingham where he remained for the rest of his career. His hobbies were home electronics, he built his own television receiver and Hi-Fi in the 1950s, and gardening where he and Dorothy made an early attempt at self sufficiency. Skyrme died on 25 June 1987 in Selly Oak Hospital, Birmingham, of an embolism after a routine operation. ==References== Category:1922 births Category:1987 deaths Category:British physicists Category:Particle physicists Category:Manhattan Project people Category:Nuclear physicists ","title":"Tony Skyrme"},{"id":"3239413","text":"Harold Roxbee Cox, Baron Kings Norton (6 June 1902 – 21 December 1997) was a British aeronautical engineer. He was notable for his contributions to British industry, particularly aeronautical engineering, and for his part in the establishment of Cranfield University. ==Life== Cox was the son of jeweller William John Roxbee Cox, of Handsworth, Staffordshire, and Amelia (née Stern). The statistician David Cox is a distant cousin. Born Harold Roxbee Cox, he was known as 'Roxbee' to his friends. As a child, his father took him to early air shows and air races, and his imagination was fuelled by pilots of the time such as Claude Grahame-White, B. C. Hucks and Gustav Hamel, beginning a lifelong fascination with aircraft. Cox left Kings Norton Grammar School (now King's Norton Boys' School) at the age of 16 and joined the Aircraft Design Department of the Austin Motor Company at Longbridge, which was at that time, designing and building light aircraft such as the Whippet and Kestrel. Guided by the chief designer, he was responsible for the design of the tail unit of the single-seat Whippet. When Austin's aviation interests failed in 1920, Cox was transferred to the workshops to work with the apprentices, and worked towards an external University of London BSc, which he gained with first class honours. In 1922 he left Longbridge for London, where he began studying for both a PhD and a DIC (Diploma of the Imperial College) at Imperial College London in the aerodynamics and instabilities of wings. As soon as he had graduated, he joined the state-financed Airship R101 engineering team at the Royal Airship Works, Cardington. After the R101 tragedy, the work that had been planned for the R100 was cancelled, and Cox began working on the development of aeroplanes at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. It was here that he contributed to aircraft safety with his studies on the problem of wing flutter and the stability of structures. By 1936 relations between Britain and Nazi Germany were steadily deteriorating, and there was a need to prepare for a possible war. An Air Defence Department was founded at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, and Cox became its head. Much of the work carried out there was with barrage balloons. There were two aims to this research. Allied balloons needed to be able to bring down enemy aircraft, and conversely friendly aircraft needed to get through any barrages unscathed. In 1936 the Government created the Air Registration Board (ARB), a new body that would examine civil aircraft and issue certificates of airworthiness. With his experience in air safety from the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Cox became their Chief Technical Officer in 1938. Immediately war was declared, Cox was transferred back to Farnborough as Superintendent of Scientific Research and was then moved to the new Ministry of Aircraft Production in May 1940, as Deputy Director of Scientific Research. He dealt with a whole range of wartime projects, and was promoted to become Director of Special Projects in 1943. Cox had the special responsibility to work on jet engines. It was now Cox's job not to be the engineer, but the facilitator. The major aircraft and engine companies had each been conducting their own research into combining gas turbines and jet propulsion, but only Group Captain Frank Whittle's jet engine design worked. However, collaboration was now more important than trade secrets, with the government encouraging any efforts that could give the Allies any edge in conflict. Cox founded, and chaired, the Gas Turbine Collaboration Committee, helping to pool ideas and experience. In 1944 the Minister of Aircraft Production, Sir Stafford Cripps, nationalised Power Jets, making Roxbee both chairman and managing director. Power Jets was restyled again in 1946 as the National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE) with Roxbee as its Director. In 1948 Cox moved from the National Gas Turbine Establishment to become Chief Scientist at the Ministry of Fuel and Power, where he applied his gas turbine knowledge for the benefit of power generation. In 1954 Cox left the civil service to begin a second career in industry, and over the next twenty years he served on the boards of companies as diverse as the British Printing Corporation, the engineers Ricardo, and chemicals company Hoechst UK. He also chaired the packaging company Metal Box and the paint-makers Bergers, Jenson and Nicholson (now Berger Paints India), and was President of the Campden and Chorleywood Food Research Association for 33 years. Playing a wider role in business, Cox was involved with a number of industry bodies. He was the Chairman of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and President of both the National Council for Quality and Reliability and the Institute of Marketing. His autobiography \\"A Wrack Behind\\", was published posthumously in 1999.A Wrack Behind, Lord Kings Norton Of Wotton Underwood, Privately Published, 1999. == College of Aeronautics and Cranfield Institute of Technology == In the summer of 1943, as the vice-president of the Royal Aeronautical Society, Cox chaired two open meetings to discuss the education and training of aeronautical engineers. The Minister of Aircraft Production, Sir Stafford Cripps soon commissioned Sir Roy Fedden, a speaker at the meetings, to report on the state of aeronautical education. His 1944 report \\"A College of Aeronautics\\" was the blueprint for Cranfield. The College of Aeronautics opened in October 1946, and was truly a unique establishment. The concept of hands-on learning with access to aircraft and an airfield was completely revolutionary. In 1953, Roxbee was appointed one of three new Deputy Chairmen on the Board of Governors, and in 1962, on the death of Sir Frederick Handley Page, he became the Board's chairman. Years of negotiation followed, and university status and a Royal Charter were granted in 1969 with the college now officially renamed Cranfield Institute of Technology, and eventually - in 1993 - Cranfield University. Cox was awarded a knighthood in the 1953 New Year Honours. When Cox was honoured with a life peerage on 22 June 1965, he took the title Baron Kings Norton, of Wotton Underwood in the County of Buckinghamshire and his chosen motto, \\"Precision and Tolerance\\", was highly appropriate. He specifically intended these words to have a double meaning and they summed him up perfectly. They were to be interpreted in both their narrow engineering context, and also their broader, social context. He was a man with great skills in science. He was also a man whose success lay in his tolerance. It wasn't only that he was a good with people; he was also a diplomat. He believed that there shouldn't be divisions between disciplines: the arts and sciences, technology and management, commerce and education. It was an ethos that he lived by, successfully having careers in aviation, education and industry. ==Personal life== In July 1927 Cox married (Doris) Marjorie (1902–1980), eldest daughter of Ernest Edward Withers, an electrical engineer, of Northwood, Middlesex (now part of the London Borough of Hillingdon). They had two sons, Christopher (1928-2018) and Jeremy (b. 1932). He married his second wife, Joan Ruth, daughter of William George Pack, of Torquay, Devon (and formerly wife of K. A. Pascoe) Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage, 1995, ed. Patrick Montague-Smith, p. 720 in 1982.

Holmes started his musical career in the Pasadena, California area in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He is best known as the lead guitarist of heavy metal band W.A.S.P. Together with Blackie Lawless and Randy Piper he was one of the founding members of the band. Holmes was a member of W.A.S.P. first from 1983 to 1990, and again from 1996 to 2001. ==Career== ===W.A.S.P.=== Prior to meeting Blackie Lawless and Randy Piper, and joining W.A.S.P., Holmes played guitar with Los Angeles bands Buster Savage, LAX, and Slave. Holmes joined W.A.S.P. from 1982 to 1990, playing on the first four studio albums and the first live album. In 1996 Holmes rejoined W.A.S.P., and remained lead guitarist until 2001. Holmes has not played with W.A.S.P. since. ===Randy Piper’s Animal=== Holmes was contacted by friend and former bandmate Randy Piper to join Piper's new project, Animal. Holmes quickly relocated to Ohio to prepare for Animal's upcoming \\"900 lb Steam\\" tour. The tour was considered successful, and after its conclusion, Animal recorded tracks for a new album. ===After Animal=== After Holmes returned to Los Angeles in late 2003, he began working with several Southern California- based metal groups, producing and contributing guitar tracks. In 2007, Holmes was involved in the filming of a Randy Rhoads documentary directed by Peter M. Margolis, which is yet to be released. Holmes appears briefly in a 2009 episode of VH1's Rock Docs, \\"Do It For The Band: The Women of Sunset Strip.\\" In the Summer of 2009 Holmes released Secret Society's \\"Death by Misadventure.\\" ===Where Angels Suffer and solo career=== Holmes in Finland in 2014 In 2010, he joined Where Angels Suffer with Randy Piper on guitar, Steve Unger (Metal Church) on bass, Rich Lewis (Animal), on vocals, and Stet Howland on drums (Blackfoot, Lita Ford, Killing Machine, Belladonna, Impellitteri, Sister and W.A.S.P.). Ira Black has since replaced Piper. The band toured Europe for the first time in 2011. On November 26, 2012, Chris Holmes released his first solo album Nothing to Lose and decided to produce, manage and distribute it himself along with his wife Catherine Holmes. After the success of his first album, Chris started recording his second solo album, Shitting Bricks. On May 2, 2015, that album was released worldwide and on the same day Chris Holmes played his first concert in Nantes, France with his new band Mean Man . Two of the songs were filmed live, and uploaded to the official YouTube channel. In September 2018, Chris recorded the EP \\"Under the Influence\\" at Replug studio, mixed by Raphael Gary and produced by Chris and Catherine Holmes. It was released on the 2nd December 2018 in Dublin. The album is scheduled to be released in 2020. Since 2019 Chris has introduced new members to Mean Man. Taking lead on the original W.A.S.P material is Oliver Tindall, who was introduced to the band after sharing the bill with Chris in Welwyn Garden City with his own band The Wicked Jackals. Alongside Ollie and also recruited from The Wicked Jackals is his new bassist Lex Gifford. Tying the 4 piece together is Stephen Jackson on drums whom Chris met 2 years prior with Alexa De Strange from Heart Break Remedy. ==The Metal Years interview== While a member of W.A.S.P., Holmes participated in the filming of the documentary film, The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years. The film included interviews with many well known heavy metal personalities of the era discussing their lifestyle and the metal scene in late 1980s Los Angeles. Holmes' contribution to the 1988 documentary is perhaps the most memorable, because he was interviewed while floating in a swimming pool, fully clothed and visibly quite intoxicated while his mother sat poolside. The interview stood out in stark contrast to the more light-hearted and humorous interviews conducted by director Penelope Spheeris, which mostly portrayed rockers as good-natured, though often dimwitted or deluded, party animals. During the interview, Holmes smiled drunkenly at the camera, deeming himself \\"a full- blown alcoholic\\" and \\"a piece of crap\\" despite his band's success, and punctuated his remarks by guzzling from three bottles of vodka. At the end of the interview, Holmes opens a full bottle of Smirnoff over his head as he rolls out of his inflatable chair and into the water. ==Mean Man documentary== Chris Holmes is the subject of the 2020 documentary Mean Man: The Story of Chris Holmes , directed by Antoine De Montremy and Laurent Hart. The project's title is from the song \\"Mean Man\\" on the 1989 W.A.S.P. album The Headless Children. ==Personal life== Chris Holmes has been married three times. His first marriage was to Kaylen Rodgers in the late 1980s. He was briefly married to Lita Ford in the early 1990s. He is now married to Catherine Holmes, whom he wed in August 2012. In 2014 Chris Holmes and Catherine Holmes moved to Finland, but after living in Porvoo for a few months they moved to France where Catherine's parents lived. The couple currently resides in Cannes, France. ==Guitars== * Jackson Custom Rhoads (Black with brass hardware).

In an interview, Holmes said that this guitar was borrowed by Eddie Van Halen for the recording of the Women and Children First album. The guitar can be seen in the Neil Zlozower \\"Women and Children First\\" Sunset Sound studio photographs. Eddie had a similar Ibanez Destroyer that he modified after recording Van Halen into the Shark Destroyer. Eddie did not like the tone after the modification so he borrowed Chris Holmes's Ibanez Destroyer. Holmes' Red Ibanez Destroyer is distinctive because it was modified to have only a single volume control whereas usually there are 2 volume and 1 tone control. The Red Ibanez Destroyer is now in the possession of The Tone Zone's Doug Anderson as part of his collection of Van Halen memorabilia often referred to as \\"The Van Halen Museum\\". ==References== ==External links== *Chris Holmes - Uber Rock Interview 2013 *Chris Holmes - Uber Rock Interview 2014 *Chris Holmes - 'Nothing To Lose' - Uber Rock Album Review Category:American heavy metal guitarists Category:Musicians from Pasadena, California Category:L.A.

He was the second presenter of Catchphrase and is currently the Senior Vice President of Entertainment for Royal Caribbean International. He presented six game shows, including two unbroadcast pilots, all for ITV productions. Of the game shows he presented, Catchphrase was the only one he presented more than one series of. ==Biography== ===Entertainment career=== He began his entertainment career on cruise ships, as a singer and comedian. In 1997, he presented the regional sports game show On the Ball in the Granada ITV region and, also working with Granada but airing nationally, presented a daytime game show on ITV, called Waffle in 1998, and also teamed up with Lisa Rogers to present the show Grudge Match from 1999 to 2000. He stands at a tall 6' 6\\", as does his brother, Simon. At the time of which he was presenting Catchphrase, he lived in Brighton, East Sussex. In 2000, Weir replaced Roy Walker as the host of the TV game show Catchphrase. During his first series, he broke his foot during a recording of the show by falling down the stairs as he made his entrance to the studio floor. The incident was edited out but was shown in a later show to explain why he was in a cast and on crutches. He continued to present his first series of Catchphrase while his foot healed, wearing a cast throughout many episodes of the show. Despite his unpopularity with viewers at the time, he succeeded in the mission of markedly improving the ratings of Series 14 and 15 in comparison to Walker's last series. Between December 2001 and January 2002, he appeared in the play Aladdin as the character of the same name in the Hexagon in Reading, Berkshire. He presented Catchphrase until 2002, although he recorded a third series in late 2001 and was shown on the ITV network between late 2002 and early 2004 usually during a quiet period on a Sunday teatime or Bank Holiday Monday. Following which, the show moved to daytime and former Blue Peter presenter Mark Curry hosted the show for the 2002 series. Predating his first game show, he also was the host in an unaired pilot for Lucky Numbers in 1994, but the host of the show was ultimately Shane Richie, and aired for three series between 1995–1997. Besides being a host, he also appeared as a contestant in a December 1997 episode of Give Us a Clue and appeared in Blankety Blank in 2001. Archive footage of Weir featured on ITV's 2014 series Come on Down! The Game Show Story. Weir also hosted a pilot for The Great British Game Show. ===Cruise and Entertainment Consulting=== Following Catchphrase, Weir served as entertainment consultant on board the Celebrity Eclipse as well as other Solstice Class ships, Celebrity Cruises' newest line of vessels. His consulting firm, based in Las Vegas and Miami, helped launch all five Solstice Class ships for Celebrity Cruises and designed the original entertainment programming. Because he had previous experience as a Cruise Director, Weir coordinated the entertainment programs, naming ceremonies and media events in the position of Cruise Director for the first few weeks of each ship's inaugural season. Weir also led the production of the documentary \\"The Making of Celebrity Reflection - The Fifth in Class\\" which captured the making of the vessels over an 18 month period.Celebrity Cruises \\"The Making of Celebrity Reflection\\" .

This theory was first stated by Marshall Sahlins at a symposium entitled \\"Man the Hunter\\" in 1966.[1] He believes hunter-gatherers were able to achieve much for their own societies, and able to satisfy their own material needs. At the time of the symposium new research by anthropologists, such as Richard B. Lee's work on the !Kung of southern Africa, was challenging popular notions that hunter-gatherer societies were always near the brink of starvation and continuously engaged in a struggle for survival. Sahlins gathered the data from these studies and used it to support a comprehensive argument that states that hunter-gatherers did not suffer from deprivation, but instead lived in a society in which \\"all the people's wants are easily satisfied.\\"Sahlins, M. (1968). \\"Notes on the Original Affluent Society\\", Man the Hunter. R.B. Lee and I. DeVore (New York: Aldine Publishing Company) pp. 85-89. == Overview == The basis of Sahlins’ argument is that hunter-gatherer societies are able to achieve affluence by desiring little and meeting those needs/desires with what is available to them. This he calls the \\"Zen road to affluence, which states that human material wants are finite and few, and technical means unchanging but on the whole adequate\\" (Sahlins, Original). This he compares to the western way towards affluence, which he terms as the \\"Galbraithean way\\" where \\"man’s wants are great, not to say infinite, whereas his means are limited...\\" and \\"the gap between means and ends can eventually be narrowed by industrial productivity\\". Thus Sahlins argues that hunter-gatherer and western societies take separate roads to affluence, the former by desiring little, the latter by producing much. Through this comparison Sahlins also stresses that hunter-gatherer societies cannot be examined through an ethnocentric framework when measuring their affluence. For example, one cannot apply the general principles of economics (principles which reflect western values and emphasize surplus) to hunter- gatherers nor should one believe that the Neolithic Revolution brought unquestioned progress. By stepping away from western notions of affluence, the theory of the original affluent society thus dispels notions about hunter- gatherer societies that were popular at the time of the symposium. Sahlins states that hunter-gatherers have a \\"marvelously varied diet\\"Sahlins, M. (2005). The Original Affluent Society [Online] in M. Sahlins, Stone Age Economics based on the abundance of the local flora and fauna. This demonstrates that hunter-gatherers do not exist on a mere subsistence economy but rather live among plenty. Through knowledge of their environment hunter- gatherers are able to change what foreigners may deem as meager and unreliable natural resources into rich subsistence resources. Through this they are able to effectively and efficiently provide for themselves and minimize the amount of time spent procuring food. \\"[T]he food quest is so successful that half the time the people do not know what to do with themselves\\". Hunter-gatherers also experience \\"affluence without abundance\\" as they simply meet their required ends and do not require surplus nor material possessions (as these would be a hindrance to their nomadic lifestyle). The lack of surplus also demonstrates that they trust their environment will continuously provide for them. By foraging only for their immediate needs among plentiful resources, hunter- gatherers are able to increase the amount of leisure time available to them. Thus, despite living in what western society deems to be material poverty, hunter-gatherer societies work less than people practicing other modes of subsistence while still providing for all their needs, and therefore increase their amount of leisure time. These are the reasons the original affluent society is that of the hunter-gatherer. Through his thesis on the affluent society, Sahlins deconstructed the then popular notions that hunter-gatherers are primitive and constantly working hard to ward off starvation. However, one must take into consideration that there has been much progress in this field since 1966 and that ideas on the category of hunter-gatherer are always shifting, with new paradigms continuously emerging. One must also acknowledge that one cannot generalize about hunter-gatherer societies. Although they have been pushed to the margins of society, there are still many such societies in the world and they differ greatly from each other. == \\"Work time\\" and \\"leisure time\\" == Sahlins' argument partly relies on studies undertaken by McCarthy and McArthur in Arnhem Land, and by Richard Borshay Lee among the !Kung. These studies show that hunter-gatherers need only work about fifteen to twenty hours a week in order to survive and may devote the rest of their time to leisure. Lee did not include food preparation time in his study, arguing that \\"work\\" should be defined as the time spent gathering enough food for sustenance. When total time spent on food acquisition, processing, and cooking was added together, the estimate per week was 44.5 hours for men and 40.1 hours for women, but Lee added that this is still less than the total hours spent on work and housework in many modern Western households. ===The three to five hour work day=== Sahlins concludes that the hunter-gatherer only works three to five hours per adult worker each day in food production. Using data gathered from various foraging societies and quantitative surveys done among the Arhem Landers of Australia and quantitative materials cataloged by Richard Lee on the Dobe Bushmen of the Kalahari, Sahlins argues that hunter-gatherer tribes are able to meet their needs through working roughly 15-20 hours per week or less. == Criticism == Sahlins' theory has been challenged by a number of scholars in the field of anthropology and archaeology. Many have criticized his work for only including time spent hunting and gathering while omitting time spent on collecting firewood, food preparation, etc. Other scholars also assert that hunter-gatherer societies were not \\"affluent\\" but suffered from extremely high infant mortality, frequent disease, and perennial warfare. This appears to be true not only of historical foraging cultures, but also prehistoric and primeval ones. David Kaplan collected references to several problems with the \\"original affluent society\\" theory and especially the McCarthy and McArthur and Lee studies, including the definitions of \\"affluence,\\" \\"work,\\" and \\"leisure,\\" the nutritional adequacy of the hunter- gatherer's diet, and the occurrence of \\"demand-sharing,\\" the constant pressure to share as a disincentive to increased effort. == See also == *The Affluent Society *Eco-communalism *Golden Age *Primitive communism *Anarcho-primitivism *Distributism *War Before Civilization *1948 American-Australian Scientific Expedition to Arnhem Land == References == Category:Anthropology Category:Green anarchism Category:Economic anthropology ","title":"Original affluent society"},{"id":"3239482","text":"The Battle of Cadzand was an early skirmish of the Hundred Years' War fought in 1337. It consisted of a raid on the Flemish island of Cadzand, designed to provoke a reaction and battle from the local garrison and so improve morale in England and amongst King Edward III's continental allies by providing his army with an easy victory. On 9 November Sir Walter Manny, with the advance troops for Edward III's continental invasion, made an attempt to take the city of Sluys, but was driven off. ==Background== For Edward, the war had not progressed as well as had been hoped at the start of the year as vacillation by allies in the Low Countries and Germany had prevented an invasion of France from progressing as intended and setbacks in the Gascon theatre had prevented any advance there either. Edward's fleet was unprepared for the crossing with the main body of his army and his finances were in a parlous state owing to his having been forced to pay large stipends to European forces. Thus he required some symbol of his intentions against the French and a demonstration of what his forces could achieve. To this end he ordered Sir Walter Manny, leader of his vanguard which was already stationed in Hainaut to take a small fleet and raid the island of Cadzand, now part of the mainland Netherlands and then part of Flanders, a semi-autonomous region of France. ==Cadzand== Cadzand was a poor, marshy island populated by fishing villages with little in the way of plunder or importance except that it was close to the wealthy Flemish port of Sluys and thus could be used as bait for the garrison of that town.Cadzand has since become part of the Dutch mainland in Zeeland province due to the silting of the channels surrounding it. A village in the old island's location still bears the name. Manny understood this well, and after an initial probe against the town failed on 9 November, he retired his 3,700 sailors and soldiers to Cadzand and unleashed them on the local population resulting in several days of feverish looting, raping and pillaging of the isolated villages in the manner of a miniature chevauchée. The garrison of Sluys, led by Sir Guy de Rickenbourg, the illegitimate son of Louis, Count of Nevers, could not let such acts occur so close to them without responding and so crossed the channel between Sluys and the island a few days later and attempted to confront Manny. The English commander was prepared for this and had his men formed up on the island in an ideal defensive position which allowed him to attack and destroy the Flemish force in a short, sharp action probably enabled by use of the longbow although no accounts of the fighting survive. Only a handful of the Flemish force were able to retreat across the channel, Guy of Flanders being captured with the other noblemen whilst the rank and file were all put to the sword. English losses were minimal. ==Aftermath== The battle had few longer-lasting effects, as Manny abandoned the island to its surviving inhabitants shortly after the victory. The allies were suitably impressed by the show of strength and the border regions of Flanders were intimidated. King Philip VI was also greatly affected by this development, assuming that traitors amongst the Flemings had caused the defeat and responding by a wave of terror and executions which continued for the remainder of his reign and served to alienate many of his allies and supporters. Ten years after the battle, when England and Flanders had become allies following an uprising in the latter, Edward III was forced to apologize and make symbolic reparations for ordering this action. Sluys was later the scene of a highly significant naval battle in 1340. ==References== *Sumption, Jonathan, The Hundred Years War, Vol 1, Trial by Battle, 1990, Category:Battles involving Flanders Category:Battles of the Hundred Years' War Category:1337 in Europe Category:Conflicts in 1337 Battle of Cadzand Category:Naval battles of the Hundred Years' War Battle of Cadzand Category:14th century in the county of Flanders ","title":"Battle of Cadzand"},{"id":"3239487","text":"The Karen Dunbar Show is a Scottish comedy sketch show that aired on BBC One Scotland, hosted by Scottish comedian Karen Dunbar.

White School of Modern Photography. White helped Steiner in finding a job at the Manhattan Photogravure Company, and Steiner worked on making photogravure plates of scenes from Robert Flaherty's 1922 Nanook of the North. Not long after, Steiner's work as a freelance photographer in New York began, working mostly in advertising and for publications like Ladies' Home Journal. With fellow graduate Anton Bruehl (1900–1982), in 1925, they opened a studio on 47th Street, producing a narrative series of amusing table-top shots of three cut‑out figures dressed in suits for The New Yorker magazine; advertisements for Weber and Heilbroner menswear in a running weekly series. Their client was wiped out in the Wall Street Crash. Through the encouragement of fellow photographer Paul Strand, Steiner joined the left-of-center Film and Photo League around 1927. He was also to influence the photography of Walker Evans, giving him guidance, technical assistance, and one of his view cameras.Rathbone, Belinda. Walker Evans: A Biography. New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1995 == Filmmaker == In 1929, Steiner made his first film, H2O, a poetic evocation of water that captured the abstract patterns generated by waves. Although it was not the only film of its kind at the time – Joris Ivens made Regen (Rain) that same year, and Henwar Rodekiewicz worked on his similar film Portrait of a Young Man (1931) through this whole period – it made a significant impression in its day and since has become recognized as a classic: H2O was added to the National Film Registry in December 2005. Among Steiner's other early films, Surf and Seaweed (1931) expands on the concept of H2O as Steiner turns his camera to the shoreline; Mechanical Principles (1930) was an abstraction based on gears and machinery. In 1930, Steiner joined the faculty of the so-called Harry Alan Potamkin Film School, which folded shortly before Potamkin's death in 1933; there he met Leo Hurwitz and, inspired by Hurwitz' ideas of utilizing film as a means of social action, left the Film and Photo League and joined Nykino, a loose coalition of New York-based cinematographers who pooled footage for use in left-wing newsreels shown at worker's rallies, conventions and during strikes. Precious few of these films have survived, most being destroyed in a warehouse fire in 1935. During this time Steiner also worked on some topical, fictional \\"pool\\" film satires, including Pie in the Sky (1935), the earliest film to involve the talents of Elia Kazan. Steiner spent summers at the Pine Brook Country Club located in the countryside of Nichols, Connecticut, which became the summer rehearsal headquarters of the Group Theatre (New York) working with Felicia Sorel and Gluck Sandor among others.Real Life Drama: The Group Theatre and America, 1931-1940, Smith, p. 212Pinewood Lake website retrieved on 2010-09-10 Images of America, Trumbull Historical Society, 1997, p. 123 Steiner worked, alongside Strand, Hurwitz and Paul Ivano as a cinematographer on Pare Lorentz' The Plow That Broke the Plains (1936) and likewise joined Lorentz on The River (1938) but did not receive credit. Although Steiner remained with Nykino throughout their transition into Frontier Films, he left in 1938, taking the footage of The City (1939) with him. The City, which Steiner co-directed with Willard Van Dyke and featuring original music by Aaron Copland, opened at the New York World's Fair in 1939 and ran for two years. Henwar Rodakiewicz moved from Los Angeles in August, 1938 to assist Steiner in the production of The City, contributing his editing, writing, and organizational skills to the project.Letter from Henwar Rodakiewicz to Ned Scott, Aug 1938: http://www.thenedscottarchive.com/news/item/henwar-rodaliewicz-assists-ralph- steiner-on-the-city.html?category_id=1 Despite his own stated disdain of Hollywood and the shared sentiments of his colleagues, in the 1940s Steiner went to Hollywood to work as a writer-producer, but returned to New York after only four years spent there. Then he plunged back into the world of freelance and fashion photography, working for Vogue, Look Magazine and others before retiring in 1962. Steiner then settled in Vermont, where he spent summers on a Maine island. ==Late films== After a lengthy break from filmmaking, Steiner resumed the activity on a private basis, creating eight films between 1960 and 1975 grouped under an umbrella title, \\"The Joy of Seeing.\\" According to Scott MacDonald, these films are marred by inappropriate soundtracks and compromised by Steiner's own desire to avoid artistic pretension at all costs, yet \\"contain much of Steiner's most beautiful and memorable imagery.\\"Scott McDonald. \\"Ralph Steiner\\" in Jan-Christoper Horak, ed., Lovers of Cinema: the first American film avant-garde, 1919-1945. University of Wisconsin Press, 1998 Nathaniel Dorsky, who helped edit Steiner's later films, stated that Steiner \\"didn't want to make anything fancy but was an old man who appreciated life itself and wanted his film to simply show the special magic there was in our visual world in the most ordinary circumstances.Letter from Nathaniel Dorsky to Scott MacDonald, 7 September 1990, quoted in \\"Ralph Steiner\\" in Jan- Christoper Horak, ed., Lovers of Cinema: the first American film avant-garde, 1919-1945.

His experimental films, however, are considered central to the literature of early American avant- garde cinema, and the influence of Ralph Steiner's visual style continues to assert itself; for example, contemporary avant-garde filmmaker Timoleon Wilkins cites Steiner as an inspiration. In his appreciation of Steiner, author Scott McDonald expands that list to include Dorsky, Andrew Noren, Larry Gottheim and Peter Hutton.Scott McDonald – \\"Ralph Steiner\\" in Jan-Christoper Horak, ed., Lovers of Cinema: the first American film avant-garde, 1919-1945.

It provides infrastructure consultancy, facilities management, property management, energy and healthcare services. It has a head office at The Shard in London and more than 200 smaller offices throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange. ==History== Mitie was founded by David Telling and Ian Stewart as MESL in 1987.MITIE: History It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1988. It merged with Highgate & Job in 1989 and was renamed the Mitie Group.David Telling: The High and MITIE The Independent, 21 March 2001 Its strategy of growth through acquisition has seen Mitie acquire several businesses over the past few years. In March 2006 it acquired Initial Security, a leading security business. In 2007 Mitie acquired Robert Prettie & Co. Ltd for £32.7m and incorporated the specialist plumbing, heating and mechanical services business into their Property Services division. In 2008 Mitie continued its strategy through the acquisition of Catering Partnership and DW Tilley. The purchase of DW Tilley allowed Mitie to extend their roofing services nationwide. 2009 saw the acquisition of Dalkia Facilities Management for £130m to bolster its Technical Facilities Management capability, and an expansion into social housing with the purchase of Environmental Property Services (EPS) for £38.5m. In 2010, Mitie acquired the integrated facilities management business of Dalkia in Ireland. Mitie made its first acquisition in the health and social care sector in October 2012, when it spent £111 million on homecare firm Enara. In April 2013 Mitie's chief executive, Ruby McGregor-Smith, was made non-executive director to the board of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. In February 2014, Mitie introduced its new visual identity. In June 2020, Mitie announced it was to buy Interserve's 40,000-strong facilities management business in a cash and shares deal worth £271m. The deal had to be ratified by Mitie's shareholders and was expected to be completed by the end of 2020. In November 2017 the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) announced an investigation into the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016. This led to the disclosure in the Annual Report for 2017 that there had been errors in the impairment testing of healthcare goodwill and that, if certain judgements had instead been treated as errors, the amount of the prior year adjustment disclosed in the 2016 results would have increased by £44.0 million. This disclosure had addressed the FRC's concerns. ==Operations== A Mitie maintenance van Mitie stands for Management Incentive Through Investment Equity. Mitie's business model was originally about taking 51% equity stakes in startup businesses that fell into its broad fields of activity. The management of the new business typically invested the remaining capital, and if targets were met it was able to sell the balance of the business to Mitie after a fixed period for a sum based on the profits achieved (an earn out). Payment was made in a mixture of cash and Mitie shares. The managers usually remained with Mitie after the earnout. Mitie is now split into: Facilities Management, Property Management, Energy Solutions and Healthcare. In February 2014 Mitie announced an eight-year contract with the Home Office, making it the largest provider of immigration removal centres in the United Kingdom. In March 2016 Mitie came under fire for its management of the immigration centres after the prison inspectorate said the facilities were “dirty”, “rundown” and “insanitary”. The firm secured a cleaning contract with Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust in June 2014 worth £90m over seven years. Sick pay cost £1.2m in its first eight months, compared with £280,000 for the NHS in the previous financial year. UNISON blamed the rise on staff stress, which it claimed had been caused by mistakes on pay. The firm admitted in November 2014 that its homecare business was less profitable than expected, and that it was struggling to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of care workers. Mitie cleaners at the Royal Opera House, the Houses of Parliament, the law firm Clifford Chance, First Great Western train services, and NHS hospitals have all held demonstrations against low pay between 2013 and 2015. In 2016 shares in Mitie fell to a four-year low after the company warned that an expected boom in outsourced services wasn’t happening. In 2015 and 2016 it was reported that Mitie was one of the most shorted stocks in the FTSE 250. Lady McGregor- Smith announced in November 2016 that it was withdrawing from the healthcare business, providing home care for the elderly, because spending cuts and rising employment costs had made it unviable. In December 2017, following a string of three profit warnings in the space of four months, Lady McGregor- Smith stepped down from her role with the outsourcing group, and was replaced by former managing director of British Gas and current Chief Executive Phil Bentley. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Business services companies of the United Kingdom Category:Outsourcing companies Category:Companies listed on the London Stock Exchange Category:Construction and civil engineering companies of the United Kingdom Category:British companies established in 1987 Category:Companies based in Bristol Category:Private providers of NHS services Category:Construction and civil engineering companies established in 1987 Category:Business services companies established in 1987 ","title":"Mitie"},{"id":"3239500","text":"Nangus is a village on the Wagga Wagga to Gundagai Road on the north side of the Murrumbidgee River.

Erwin Stein (7 November 188517 July 1958) was an Austrian musician and writer, prominent as a pupil and friend of Schoenberg, with whom he studied between 1906 and 1910. ==Career== Stein worked as a conductor before the First World War. In 1918 Schoenberg founded the Society for Private Musical Performances, which presented modern compositions (from Mahler to the present day). Stein was one of his principal assistants in this project which ran for a few years until encountering financial problems. The works performed often needed arrangement for the reduced forces available to the Society. Stein undertook arrangements, for example, in 1921 he arranged Mahler's symphony no. 4 for 15 musicians. In 1924 it was Stein to whom Schoenberg entrusted the delicate as well as important task of writing the first article – Neue Formprinzipien ('New Formal Principles') – on the gradual evolution of what was soon to be explicitly formulated as 'twelve-tone technique'. Until 1938 he lived in Vienna, working for the music publisher Universal Edition and respected as a music teacher and conductor as well as a writer active on behalf of the music and composers he valued. After the Anschluss during the course of Aryanization, Stein was forced to sell his stockholdings in Universal Edition. He fled to London to escape the Nazis and worked for many years as an editor for the music publisher Boosey & Hawkes. His focus was mainly on Mahler, Schoenberg and Britten (all three of whom he knew personally) as well as his colleagues within the Schoenberg circle, Berg and Webern. ==Legacy== His books include Orpheus in New Guises (a collection of writings from the period 1924–1953) and Form and Performance (1962). He was the editor of the first collection of Schoenberg's letters (Germany 1958; UK 1964). He was also instrumental in setting up the modern music periodical Tempo in 1939.Harewood.

(taken from spot marked \\"M\\" on plan below) Entrance front c. 1868. Brympton d'Evercy (alternatively Brympton House), a manor house near Yeovil in the county of Somerset, England, has been called the most beautiful in England. In 1927 the British magazine Country Life published three articles on the house, in which Christopher Hussey, near the start of a 50-year career as an architectural authority, termed it \\"the one which created the greatest impression and summarises so exquisitely English country life qualities.\\"Country Life, Saturday, 7 May 1927. His articles remain the only detailed account of the house, which has belonged to six families: the D'Evercys, Stourtons, Sydenhams, Fanes, Weeks (1992–2008), and Glossops since 2008. ==History== Building was begun by the D'Evercy family about 1220 and proceeded slowly into the 18th century. For 750 years it remained little known or recorded. For a few years after the Second World War it held a boys' school, before being reclaimed by its owners as a private house. This it remains, although it is occasionally hired out as a location for filming or a hospitality event. Brympton d'Evercy from the south around 1722 by Jan Kip and Leonard Knyff. The complex of buildings consists of the mansion, its stables and other outbuildings, the parish church and a puzzling building known as the Priest House. Little remains of the original D'Evercy manor built between 1220 and 1325, as the present house has evolved on the same site. Brympton d'Evercy was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Brunetone, meaning \\"brown enclosure\\", from the Old English brun and tun. The village of Brympton is larger today than at any time in its history. Until the 20th century, it barely qualified as a village, having been largely deserted in the 14th century. Its few cottages were scattered along the drive to the secluded mansion, a few of which can be discerned in the view by Knyff (illustrated right). Today a new urban area known as Brympton is a suburb of Yeovil and encroaches on the seclusion of the house. In Somerset and adjoining Dorset, many such houses as Brympton d'Evercy contain wings in several architectural styles by unrecorded local architects and builders. Their owners were nearly all related to each other in some way, and competition among them was great. As a result, the wings in various houses can be almost identical, having been constructed by the same builder, rather than an architect, using drawings based on the works of the master architects from as far afield as Rome. This applies particularly from the 17th century onwards. Various owners of Brympton d'Evercy were related to the Stourtons of Preston Plucknett, the Pouletts of Hinton House, the Phelips of Montacute House, and the Strangways of Melbury House. The \\"county\\" families not actually akin were usually close friends, so that architectural ideas would be exchanged along with local gossip in frequent visits between them. Before the 17th century, the architect's profession was unknown, Sir John Summerson has observed: all houses were built by local builders following the ideas of their patrons. Inigo Jones, perhaps the first widely noted English architect, introduced Palladian ideals to English architecture: his Banqueting House at Whitehall of 1619 set a standard and was much copied. By the 1630s his ideas had permeated as far as Somerset. In the grander families, there was generally a Member of Parliament, or as in the case of the Earls of Ilchester, the head of the family kept a London house. These more travelled members of provincial society would return to their Somerset estates and country houses with recent architectural ideas. Occasionally one of the richer county families would employ a renowned architect, such as John Webb, Jones's son-in-law. Born in Somerset, Webb moved to London, but after his cosmopolitan success worked in Dorset at Kingston Lacy – a new mansion, built by the Banks family to replace Corfe Castle, destroyed by Cromwellian troops in the Civil War. At Wilton House in neighbouring Wiltshire, Inigo Jones himself is believed to have put much into the design. Once introduced into Somerset practice, the new genres of architecture were interpreted by local draughtsmen and masons, then applied, often haphazardly, to the old houses of the local gentry. In this way Brympton d'Evercy and its neighbours slowly evolved. ==Architectural appraisal== Brympton d'Evercy, stages of construction.

Each generation enlarged and altered the house according to whim or current fashion. The -long west front (shown at the top of the page) was built in the late Tudor period. Two large windows on either side of the door provide light for the double- height Great Hall, which was much increased in size by the new west front. The older north wing adjacent to the great hall probably contained the private rooms of its builder, John Sydenham. The architecture of the house is as diverse as the people who influenced its appearance over 400 years. It is built entirely of the same local, golden-yellow hamstone found only in the buildings of a few villages close to Yeovil. For the first few years of ownership, the Sydenhams appear content with the way it was when purchased from d'Evercy heirs. However, considerations of privacy and comfort that spread in English domestic architecture from the mid-15th century began to be applied, if only for the immediate family of the head of household. These are reflected at Brympton d'Evercy in the first major building works of the Sydenhams in 1460. ===The 1460 wing=== This first expansion of the original d'Evercy house, probably on the site of the present staircase hall (\\"K\\" on plan), occurred in 1460, when the Sydenhams added the south-west block (\\"B\\" on plan). This held the house's first reception rooms other than the hall, consisting of a solar and retiring or withdrawing rooms for the lord of the manor and his family. Until then the whole household would have lived and dined together in the hall. This wing has been much altered, having been given a new window arrangement in the 17th century, when the south wing was built. However, it retains its original mock battlements, which betray its age, as does a slight irregularity in the placements of the windows, compared to the perfect symmetry of the adjoining, later south wing. ===The Priest House=== The \\"Priest House\\" (marked E on plan): thought to have been built in 1460–1470 as a dower house by Joan Sydenham In the late 15th century, a free-standing earlier structure (marked \\"E\\" on plan) was much enhanced; it flanks the mansion almost as though it were a wing of the house itself. Its origins and uses have long been debated. Possibly this was the chantry said to have been built by the D'Evercy family. Though it is known traditionally as the Priest House, its entrance faces away from the church, into the former forecourt of the 15th-century house. According to one account, \\"It may originally have been a range of lodgings for retainers or guests.\\"Nicholas Cooper, Houses of the Gentry 1480–1680 (1999), p. 258 . Whatever its original use, it seems certain that it was remade as a dower house by Joan Stourton, who had married John Sydenham in 1434, not realising that her own son would predecease her, so allowing her to remain in the main house for the rest of her life. The building is a rare example of a complete small medieval country house, an oblong structure on two floors, the upper containing a hall, solar and bedroom, while the lower for servants had no internal means of reaching the upper floor, to which access was obtained by a newel staircase in a turret opening outside. The house, obviously designed for a person of refinement, had unusually good sanitation in the form of two garderobes; the wooden chutes were still in existence in the early 20th century. The siting of the garderobes here facing the church reinforces the idea that this was the rear of the house; no such arrangement would have been made if this were truly the Priest's House. In the 17th century its principal room on the upper storey was given a decorative plaster ceiling. Upstairs is a tessellated Roman pavement of blue lias limestone and red tile. This was excavated in 1923 by Ralegh Radford from a building near Westland Road in Yeovil. ===The North or Henry VIII wing=== The next major addition to the house was the north wing (\\"C\\" on plan). Its turret, oriels and external sculpted moulding make it almost a miniature country house in itself. This wing has remained largely unchanged since it was built about 1520.Nicholas Cooper dates this wing to 1534. However, 1534 was when John Sydenham made the house over to his son, and document detailing the gift mentions the already completed wing as \\"the nether parlour and the two chambers over\\". Christopher Hussey dates the wing to about 1520. John Sydenham wished to retain an independent lodging at the house after its handover. He built for himself three floors with a room on each, its own external entrance and staircase turret – a house within a house. Architecturally it must have been strikingly modern at the time. The façade is richly ornamented with coats-of-arms and tracery. The roof line is castellated, the battlements purely for ornament, not defence. The two upper floors have large oriel windows; between these is the finely sculpted the coat of arms of King Henry VIII. This the Sydenhams were permitted displaying due to their relationship to the Stourton family, who claimed connections with the blood royal. Thus this part of the house is sometimes called the Henry VIII wing, though the King never visited. Of all the house's varied wings, this north is probably the most architecturally accomplished, displaying the most up-to-date traits and flamboyance of contemporary Tudor architecture. ===West Front=== The clock tower (\\"H\\" on plan) the base was formerly the Tudor entrance porch to the house. It was given an upper storey and moved to its current location in 1722. The central section of the west front contains on the ground floor the hall (marked \\"A\\" on the plan); the rear section of the hall almost certainly was once the great hall of the original smaller d'Evercy manor rebuilt by the Sydenhams in 1450. The great hall, though, did not achieve its present size until the building of the west front (\\"F\\" on plan) in the late 16th century. The new front projects further forward than the previous, so that the older turret of the north wing became less obvious, as three-quarters of its mass was absorbed into the enlarged hall. The west front has two large mullioned double-height windows flanking the principal entrance. The present glazed Gothick castellated porch (G on plan) was added in 1722, when the existing 15th-century porch was moved into the garden, given an extra storey and transformed into a clock tower (\\"H\\" on plan). The hall's central open fire, was replaced by a fireplace complete with chimney, so that it became possible to place a second floor above the hall. ===The kitchen wing=== The next major addition, still in 16th century, was the kitchen block (\\"O\\" on plan), interesting for its huge proportions and barrel vaulted roof, suggesting an original function less humble than a kitchen. The kitchen is on two levels, the upper reached by a flight of short steps from the lower at each side of its width, yet the space does not appear ever to have been divided. From the kitchen range projects a turret (on the right hand between O and K on the plan) containing a spiral staircase, crowned by a belfry. This would have originally given a second access to the upper floor of the original house, now replaced by the Palladian south wing. From the kitchen stretches another wing (\\"P\\" on plan) of indeterminate date (no later than 1690). This seems always to have been known as the Farmhouse and inhabited by the family of the home-farm tenant. It may possibly have been intended as a secondary or service wing, or even part of a grander, never-completed scheme. ===South Front and wing=== The wing which finally gave the mansion to its present appearance is no better documented than the rest of the house. Opinion on the exact date of construction of the south wing is divided (\\"L\\" on plan) between 1670 and 1680, with some suggesting it had been started as early as 1636 or the early years of the Restoration of 1660.All references for this article agree it was built about 1680. Sir John Posthumous Sydenham who built it died in 1692. Dating the wing is essential to identifying the architect: the south wing, if considered to date from the 1630s, was often attributed to Inigo Jones – many English houses make this claim, some like Wilton House with more plausibility than othersChristopher Hussey explains: \\"The Inigo Jones legend grew on the strength of a casual reference to it by Horace Walpole in Anecdotes of painting\\" – until Christopher Hussey debunked the myth in 1927, largely based on the assumption that the south wing was completed in 1680, when Jones would have been dead for 20 years.Historians of Brympton d'Evercy have based the 1680 date of completion on a sale particulars dated 1697 in which the house is described as \\"a very large new built mansion house\\". Robert Dunning in Somerset Country Houses points out that rainwater pipes put up at the latest on the facade's immediate completion bear the arms of Sir John Posthumous Sydenham and his wife Elizabeth Poulett. The couple married in 1664, and she died in 1669. From this Dunning concludes, \\"Work... seems to belong to, or at the very least to have been finished in, the early years of the Restoration.\\" The most noticeable similarity between Jones's documented work and Brympton d'Evercy is the use of alternating triangular and segmental window pediments, but Jones only ever used this motif to give importance to the windows of the piano nobile, for at Brympton d'Evercy the alternating pediments give both floors equal value. The piano nobile at Brympton is most unusual in being on the ground floor. It is doubtful that a master architect who had designed for the Royal family, and the highest echelons of the aristocracy, would have considered such a placing. Also typical of Jones, but a common feature of the time, is the balustrade parapet hiding a hipped roof. However, the greatest architectural clues that suggest Jones had no hand in the design of the mansion are basic ones: the architect of Brympton d'Evercy gave the façade 10 bays, which means the windows begin with a segmental pediment and end with a triangular one, and no master architect would have permitted such an affront to balance. Finally, as the house is of ten bays, it has no central focus: this is not an architectural crime, but what is such is that the South front in its centre has a focal point: a drain pipe sited there since the building's completion. The evidence would suggest that the South facade was inspired by Hinton House, at nearby Hinton St George, the childhood home of Sir John Posthumous Sydenham's wife, completed in 1638. These two houses, along with Long Ashton House, were probably designed and built by the same local family of architects and masons, working from drawings by Serlio's treatise on architecture, which had been published in five volumes in London in 1611. ==Baroque state apartments== Garden front c. 1860. Whoever the architect was, the new south wing was intended to transform Brympton d'Evercy from a country manor into a grand house. Of ten bays, the two-storied building housed on its ground floor the finest and most lavishly decorated rooms of the house. Known as the state apartments, they follow an arrangement common in houses built before about 1720, where important guests were lodged: a series of rooms in a strict order of precedence. A large bedroom suite or apartment, with all rooms on an axis, was connected by large double doors to create an enfilade. The first, largest and grandest room, known as the salon, was intended for a visiting dignitary to grant audience to the household, all of whom would be given access to this room. Then comes a large withdrawing room, slightly less grand; here the guest would receive people more privately than in the saloon. The next room followed the same pattern, each space becoming more intimate and private as the enfilade progressed. The final and most private room was the state bedroom: beyond this were two small closets for staff and private ablutions. This pattern of Baroque apartments exists in large houses all over England. In the very largest, such as Blenheim Palace, it could have two such suites branching from either side of the saloon, but Brympton d'Evercy was not such a grand house. Why it needed a suite of state apartments has never been settled. Often presumed is an intended visit by Queen Anne, but they were at the very least ten years old when she ascended the throne, and she certainly never made such a visit. The state bed remained in situ until 1956, but was never slept in by a sovereign. About 1720, such state rooms became old-fashioned and often transformed for more general and frequent use. At Brympton d'Evercy the saloon became the Drawing Room, the following room became known as the Oak or Small Drawing Room, and the next room the Dining Room. Only the state bedroom remained in solitary magnificence, slept in by honoured, if non-royal guests. At Brympton d'Evercy these were more likely to be talented cricketers than potentates. ===19th- century works=== In the mid-19th century, Brympton d'Evercy was the home of Lady Georgiana Fane, the daughter of John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland, a single lady of modest means who had no need of a large and lavish household. The house was not given the Victorian wings added so carelessly to many historic houses. Lady Georgiana confined herself to improving the gardens and grounds. She added a balustrade to the walls enclosing the forecourt in front of the west facade; the walls, topped by balustrading, link the Priest House, the churchyard on the south side, and the clock-tower and stables on the north. The effect was to create what in a grander house than Brympton d'Evercy would be known as a cour d'honneur. Entered through great gate piers crowned by urns (see the illustration at the top of page), such an effect is softened and de-formalised by lawns and some very English-style flower beds. The broad gravel terrace across the south front was also created at this time, along with the large pond which reflects it. Other than necessary restoration work and modern plumbing and electricity, little has been added to the house since the 19th century. It is now recognised by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. ==Owners== ===The D'Evercys=== The D'Evercy family were responsible for building the almost adjoining church. Christopher Hussey suggests that the D'Evercy's manor at Brympton was little more than an unostentatious range of buildings on the site of that part of the present staircase wing (marked K on plan), with an adjoining farmyard to the north of it. The remains of a farm exist on the probable site of the D'Evercy's farm today, and an old farmhouse (marked P on plan) adjoins the much later south wing built on the probable site of the original manor. Thomas d'Evercy purchased the estate in 1220 from the Chilterne family (of whom nothing is known). The d'Evercy family derived their name from Evrecy, a village near Caen in Normandy. Thomas d'Evercy was part of the retinue of the Norman Earl of Devon, which is the reason he left the family estates on the Isle of Wight to reside in Somerset. D'Evercy represented Somerset and South Hampshire at the first Parliament of England. Following Thomas d'Evercy's death, family records are scarce until the time of the last d'Evercy, Sir Peter, who twice represented Somerset in Parliament, under Edward II. The church next to the house, St Andrew's, dates from this period. Sir Peter founded a chantry at Brympton d'Evercy in 1306, endowing a priest with a messuage and in the parish. It has been suggested that this is the building today known as the Priest House, but no structural evidence exists to support this claim.Christopher Hussey and Robert Dunning both believe it to be a dower house built for Joan Sydenham in the 15th century. Charles Clive-Ponsonby-Fane in Brympton d'Evercy claims it was built by the d'Evercy in the 13th century. Sir Peter died in 1325, when the estate was described as \\"a certain capital messuage, with gardens and closes adjoining\\".Country Life, Saturday, 7 May 1927 The village at the time contained 17 smallholders and three tenant farmers. Sir Peter's widow remained in occupation, and on her death the estate passed to the Glamorgan family, the d'Evercy's daughter Amice having married John de Glamorgan. Later it seems to have passed through obscure descent to the Wynford family, of whom nothing other than their names is recorded. In 1343 the estate was recorded as \\"a manor house sufficiently built with a certain garden adjoining planted with divers and many apple trees, the whole covering some two acres.\\" The record goes on to record some forty householders all charged to serve their lord as \\"village blacksmith, drover or domestic servant\\".This record forms part of an enquiry by the Crown and heir to Brympton, following a dispute over ownership following the death of Peter de Glamorgan in 1343. Dunning \\"Somerset Country Houses\\". This was the highest population the village was to have until the late 20th century. ===The Sydenhams=== The tomb of John Sydenham Arms of Sydenham: Argent, three rams passant guardant sable Sydenham; Orchard Sydenham; Combe Sydenham; Brympton d'Evercy; Combe, Dulverton; Pixton Sir Philip Sydenham, 3rd Baronet (1676–1739), the last Sydenham to reside at Brympton d'Evercy.In 1430 following a legal battle over disputed titles, the Wynfords sold the reversion of the estate to John Stourton (died 1438) of Preston Plucknett in Somerset, 7 times MP for Somerset, in 1419, 1420, December 1421, 1423, 1426, 1429 and 1435. Stourton used it as a dowry for his second daughter Joan Stourton (one of his three daughters and co-heiresses) when in 1434 she married John Sydenham MP, of Combe Sydenham in Somerset. The Sydenham family originated at the manor of Sydenham near Bridgwater, Somerset and were said at one time to have been England's largest landowners,Charles Clive-Ponsonby-Fane in \\"Brympton d'Evercy\\" describes them as \\"..the largest landowning family in England\\". Christopher Hussey in his \\"Country Life\\" article describes them as large Somerset landowners. yet their wealth seems to have fluctuated with each generation. John Sydenham as an infant inherited the estate from his grandmother, the original Joan Sydenham (née Stourton). However, Brympton D'Evercy was not the principal family residence at this time. In 1534 John Sydenham made over the house to his son, also, John – having first built the North wing to be his private lodgings for later visits. The new owner John III, was a great landowner bequeathing to each of his many children an estate. This lack of primogeniture proved to be the Sydenham's downfall. John III's successor John IV (died 1585), and his son John V (died 1625) were considerably less wealthy than their forebears, and used the house as their sole residence, the result of which was, despite their comparative penury, they added much to the house. John IV built the present west front thus enlarging the hall, and John V built the large kitchen block. Sir John Posthumous Sydenham (\\"Posthumous\\" because born after the death of his father) built the south wing in the 17th century. He married Elizabeth Poulett, a descendant of Sir Amias Paulet, and member of one of Somerset's oldest and most notable families. The Pouletts lived at nearby Hinton House at Hinton St George. Sir John died in 1696, having severely depleted the family's already precarious fortunes by building the house's state apartments. Sir John was succeeded by his son Philip, a weak spendthrift, but also a Member of Parliament for Somerset. At the time membership of Parliament was an expensive rich man's occupation and the Sydenham's money was running out. By 1697 Philip Sydenham was attempting to sell the estate for a price between £16,000 and £20,000. In the event of no purchaser being found, Sydenham mortgaged the estate to Thomas Penny, the Receiver-General of Somerset who collected Somerset's taxes for the crown. Penny made a few alterations to the mansion: he added the castellated and glazed porch to the South front, removing the earlier porch to the garden, where it became a clock tower. He also and made a new entrance to the Priest House. Penny then suffered a blow to his own fortunes: he was found to be rather cavalier in passing on the taxes he collected to the Crown, and was dismissed from office. He died in 1730 having executed no further work to the estate. The house and estate were then put up for auction in 1731 and sold for £15,492.10s.Charles Clive-Ponsonby-Fane, Brympton d'Evercy ===The Fanes=== Thomas Lawrence. The new owner was Francis Fane, a barrister and Member of Parliament. The Fanes completed the interior decoration of the state rooms, but other than that they are remarkable only for various eccentricities rather than their structural alterations. Francis Fane lived at Brympton d'Evercy for 26 years before bequeathing it to his brother Thomas, who became the 8th Earl of Westmorland. Thus again the house became a secondary residence and seemingly left largely empty until the time of John 10th Earl. This amorous adventurerThe 10th Earl had eloped in 1782 with Anne, his first wife, the daughter and heiress of the banker Robert Child of Osterley Park. Child, incandescent with rage, followed the couple as far as Preston, where he actually shot one of the eloping couple's carriage horses. Even this failed to stop them, but one of Westmorland's coachmen cut loose the horses of Child's carriage, thus enabling the couple to reach Gretna Green and marry before Child could apprehend them. had taken as his second wife Jane Saunders, the surgeon Richard Saunders Huck's daughter, who was so wildly eccentric that Charles Fox described her as \\"perhaps not mad, but nobody ever approached so near it with so much reason.\\"Somerset Country Houses. Robert Dunning, p. 20. The Countess decided to shock conventional society and leave her husband, taking her daughter Lady Georgiana Fane with her. This unconventional pair of ladies set up home at Brympton d'Evercy. The countess was responsible for installing the classical fireplaces which remain today, and assembling the furniture and art collection that were not dispersed until in a large sale in the late 1950s. Lady Georgiana Fane, like her mother of a lively disposition, declined a proposal of marriage from Lord Palmerston, preferring instead to conduct a liaison with the Duke of Wellington. This relationship with the Iron Duke is her chief claim to fame. A cousin of Wellington's friend Mrs. Arbuthnot, Georgiana too became a close friend of the Duke; however, in later life she claimed the Duke had reneged on a promise to marry her. At that time this was a civil offence; she also threatened to publish the Duke's love letters to her. By the strict Victorian standards of the day this would have been a national scandal. The affair was \\"hushed up,\\" but a letter exists from the Duke of Wellington to Georgiana's mother urging her \\"to prevail upon her daughter to cease molesting him with daily vituperative letters.\\"Fulbeck Hall, A Lincolnshire House Sale in London by Sotheby's It has also been claimed that Lady Georgiana in fact refused the young future Duke of Wellington's proposal, on the grounds she could not marry so lowly a soldier. Another version of the same story is that Lady Georgiana's father the 10th Earl of Westmorland forbade the marriage of his daughter to an untitled soldier with apparently limited prospects. Both of these stories, however, must be apocryphal, as Lady Georgiana never knew him before he was a \\"great man\\". She was born in 1801;Westmorland (Apethorpe) Collection, box 1/parcel VI/no. 2, Northamptonshire Record Office Wellington (then Sir Arthur Wellesley) was married in 1806, and was created a duke in 1814. His wife died in 1831. Lady Georgiana began pursuing him some time after that. The Countess died 26 March 1857. Lady Georgiana lived on as the sole châtelaine of Brympton: her bedroom in the North wing retained her name until the 20th century. She altered the house little, but was responsible for the large pond in the garden, and some other improvements in the grounds. She died 4 December 1874,Burke's Peerage, 1899 edition, page 1529 leaving the heavily indebted estate to her nephew the Hon. Spencer Ponsonby, younger son of the 4th Earl of Bessborough ===The Ponsonby-Fanes=== Cartoon of Rt. Hon. Sir Spencer Ponsonby- Fane (1824–1915) Spencer Ponsonby, at the time in Ireland with his elder brother Frederick, escaping a court subpoena for an indiscretion, at first refused to receive the telegram informing him of his inheritance, assuming it was for his elder brother. Indiscretion appears to have been habitual in this family: Lady Caroline Lamb was his aunt. Fane family legend, and most reference books relate that the two brothers cut cards to decide who was to return to face the British courts and the debt-ridden estate, Spencer Ponsonby picked the lower card and returned to claim his inheritance:This story which is quoted in Brympton d'Evercy is almost certainly apocryphal. In 1875 Ponsonby-Fane was 51 not quite a young aristocrat escaping the courts. From the 1850s he had been a member of Queen Victoria's household, a lady who was not given to tolerating indiscretions among them. Ponsonby-Fane was also on the committee of the MCC, where any minor indiscretion would not be tolerated either. He had also been private secretary to successive British Foreign Ministers, and was by all accounts an upstanding member of the establishment. he is said to have seen Brympton d'Evercy and vowed to retain it at all costs.We Started a Stately Home. Charles Clive-Ponsonby-Fane. Introduction vi. Whatever the truth of the legend. Spencer Ponsonby, newly renamed Spencer Ponsonby-Fane (in accordance with Lady Georgiana Fane's last wishes), was a pillar of the British establishment, one-time private secretary to Lord Palmerston, and later comptroller of Buckingham Palace in the reign of King Edward VII. However it was cricket that was his first love, although he did father eleven children. Through Sir Spencer Ponsonby-Fane Brympton d'Evercy became a meeting place of cricket lovers. It had its own cricket pitch, where large house parties played against local and visiting teams. A house party devoted to cricket took place each year, a tradition which survived long after Sir Spencer's death and into the 1950s. As treasurer of the MCC, Sir Spencer laid the foundation stone for the pavilion at Lord's. He founded the Old Stagers club of Canterbury, and most eccentrically the team known as I Zingari, a wandering cricket club of assorted aristocrats and Victorian and Edwardian notables. Throughout Sir Spencer's ownership of Brympton the house and estate were maintained, but survived only through the good fortune of low taxation and agricultural rents. This branch of the Fane family had never been wealthy, and World War I was to bring sweeping changes to not just Brympton d'Evercy but country houses all over Britain. The stables built in 1720, situated in the north west corner of the forecourt, the doors have massive palladian pediments, while the windows have typical Somerset style provincial lintels. Spencer Ponsonby-Fane died in 1915, leaving his estate to his eldest son John, who in turn died just a year after inheriting, leaving the estate to his son Richard. Richard Ponsonby-Fane was an aesthetic intellectual and also an invalid. Unmarried, he chose to spend most of the year in Japan, a subject on which he published several books and papers. He returned to England and Brympton d'Evercy for just a few weeks each summer in order to follow the cricket. In his prolonged absences the house was occupied by his sister Violet and her husband Captain Edward Clive, a descendant of Clive of India. Violet Clive has been described as \\"a grand eccentric and remarkable woman [who] played hockey for the west of England, rowed for the Leander Club, was a master carpenter and keen landscape gardener.\\"Tribute paid Violet Clive's grandson Charles. We Started a Stately Home. Intro vii.

Apart from an annual day trip to London to the Chelsea Flower Show and a short annual holiday at her fishing lodge in Ireland, she seldom left Brympton d'Evercy, preferring to spend her days in endless gardening in the style of Gertrude Jekyll. This quiet existence admirably suited the family's finances, because on her death in 1955, her only son and heir Nicholas was forced to sell the contents of the house. This large collection of fine art and antiques had been assembled by the Countess of Westmorland and Lady Georgiana Fane. After the sale the family (their surname now Clive-Ponsonby-Fane) moved to the nearby vicarage. ==World War II== From 1939 to 1940, Westcroft Preparatory School was housed at Brympton, having been evacuated from Cricklewood in north London. ===Sale of contents=== The contents of the house were sold by auction under a marquee outside the house over a five-day period of 26 November – 1 December 1956. Described extensively, if a little quaintly, by the auctioneers John D Wood of London as \\"including interesting examples of 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, a fine set of George II chairs, Queen Anne and Chippendale mirrors, cabinets, chests, tables, buffets, sets of chairs, clocks, Jacobean needlework, French commodes, vitrines, tables and numerous other period piece... old paintings and a library of books.\\"Sale Catalogue of Brympton d'Evercy R. B. Taylor and Sons. John D. Wood and Co. 1956. In truth the collection included items of national importance, but the 1950s were an era of destruction and dismantling of British country houses, and such sales were not uncommon, as was exemplified in the Destruction of the Country House exhibition of 1974. Among the 909 paintings described as old masters were works by Thomas Lawrence, including a version of his state portrait of George IV, and his portrait of the 10th Earl of Westmorland, proving the earl's estranged wife did not totally forget him. Also in the sale were numerous works by Kneller, Romney, Lely, Snyders and at least ten attributed to Van Dyke: the paintings are listed in the \\"contents of the house\\" together with Tudor, Chippendale, Sheraton and Louis XV furniture, and an \\"assortment of bed sheets\\", \\"3 new towels and an \\"old bedspread\\". The sale was reported with due gravity and deference by the provincial press.This information is taken from a newspaper cutting found in the catalogue. Other news stories on the reverse suggest the newspaper is the local Yeovil Western Gazette for the week beginning Monday 3 December 1956. \\"The 400 chairs provided for the convenience of the buyers proved insufficient to accommodate the company.... Top price of the week was £2000 for a Chinese dinner service... many of the pieces being badly damaged... a pair of Chippendale mirrors £1,350... a small carpet £800\\". And so the list continued, detailing the prices fetched for Brympton d'Evercy's former treasures, including first editions of works by Charles Dickens and Daniel Defoe. On the last day of the sale an iron garden seat was sold for £14. Prices for the paintings are not recorded in the article except one of those \\"after\\" Vandyck, which fetched £85. The Clive-Ponsonby-Fane family retained a few of the family portraits and smaller items of furniture and moved to their smaller new home nearby, letting the house be converted into a boys' boarding school known as Clare School. Nicholas Clive-Ponsonby-Fane retained the ownership of the house and estate until his sudden death in 1963, when it passed to his wife Petronilla Clive-Ponsonby-Fane. On her remarriage in 1967, the house and what remained of the estate became the property of their son Charles Clive-Ponsonby-Fane. Clare School remained in possession of the house until 1974. ===Stately home=== Circa 1900: A boating party on the \\"pond\\" created by Lady Georgiana Fane in the mid 19th century.In 1974 Charles Clive-Ponsonby-Fane reclaimed his ancestral home and moved with his new wife back into Brympton d'Evercy with the intention of restoring it and opening it to the public as a stately home. His problem was that, while the empty and neglected house may have been his home, it was far from stately. While the house was structurally in a fair condition, it had not been redecorated since the 18th century and had endured the obvious ravages caused by its use as a boys' school. The redecoration of the state rooms was executed on a very restricted budget. The principal problem facing the owners was furnishing the house. Few of its former contents remained, and while Brympton d'Evercy is not on a par with Blenheim Palace in size, it still required large items and quantities of high-quality antique furniture. This was the stumbling block to the stately home scheme. The Clive-Ponsonby-Fanes made great efforts to draw in the crowds, an agricultural museum, a vineyard, a distillery of apple brandy, but none of this was interesting enough to attract visitors from as far afield as London, let alone those from across the Atlantic. Ultimately, as a financial enterprise, opening to the public failed. In 1992 after almost 300 years of ownership the family sold Brympton d'Evercy. The situation was summed up at the time by the satirist Auberon Waugh: \\"Last week we learnt that the most beautiful house in Somerset has been sold.... It is sad of course for the family who owned it, who had made a valiant effort to keep it going.... It did not succeed as a showpiece: they had run out of money, the internal decorations were dreadful, and they lacked the proper kit to make it look like anything more than a prep school on open day. So now the most beautiful house in England will be a private family home once again....\\" ==In the 21st century== Brympton in 1973 To offset the cost of maintaining such a large and historic dwelling in the 21st century, the present owners allow the house to be used for corporate and public hospitality, and as a wedding venue. Marriages can take place in the nearby church or in the principal rooms. Receptions and functions can also be held in the grounds, including the 17th- century stables. The house has also been the location for television serials, and filming. The gardens are listed, Grade II*, on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England. For the greater part of the year, the house remains a little-known home. The greatest threat to the house, now without its former estate, is the ever encroaching town of Yeovil. Once some miles distant, its suburbs and industrial estates are now almost visible from the windows of the house. As recently as June 2005 a public planning enquiry was held to investigate the suitability of 15 hectares of land adjacent to the house to be developed as a business park. ===In popular culture=== The Turn of the Screw, a 2009 adaptation by the BBC of classic Henry James novel starring Michelle Dockery and Dan Stevens, was filmed at the house and grounds. ==References== *Christopher Hussey, \\"Brympton D'Evercy, Somerset\\", in Country Life LXI (1927) pp 718ff, 7762ff, 775ff *Charles Clive-Ponsonby-Fane, Brympton d'Evercy. 1976.

Wenger even went as far as to state “I have no doubt in my mind that had he lived, he would have been captain of Arsenal and of Italy.” Brady later also stated \\"I always remember Niccolo. Losing a boy that young was a real tragedy. He was a great footballing talent. He had a great future ahead of him.\\" He stated that he stood out from his teammates due to his \\"maturity and intelligence\\", describing him as a \\"complete player\\", stating: \\"He had it all -- the ball control, passing, the physicality.\\" The football training centre used by Bologna FC, in the neighbourhood of Casteldebole, is named after Galli; Bologna FC also retired his number 27 shirt. Arsenal observed a minute's silence upon the news of his death. Galli's childhood friend and youth academy teammate Fabio Quagliarella wears the number 27 in his honour. A foundation has also been dedicated to Galli in his honour. ==Personal life== Niccolò's father Giovanni Galli, was also a professional footballer; a former goalkeeper, he played for Fiorentina, Milan, Napoli, Torino, Parma, and Lucchese, as well as the Italy national football team, before pursuing a career in politics after his retirement. His mother's name is Anna; he also had two sisters, Camilla and Carolina. ==References== ==External links== * Niccolò Galli Foundation Category:1983 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Italian footballers Category:ACF Fiorentina players Category:Parma Calcio 1913 players Category:Arsenal F.C. players Category:Bologna F.C. 1909 players Category:Motorcycle road incident deaths Category:Serie A players Category:Italy youth international footballers Category:Road incident deaths in Italy Category:Association football defenders ","title":"Niccolò Galli (footballer, born 1983)"},{"id":"3239587","text":"The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance (MPNI) was a British government ministry responsible for the administration and delivery of welfare benefits. It was headed by the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance. It was created in 1953 as a result of the amalgamation of the Ministry of Pensions and the Ministry of National Insurance. In 1968 a departmental reorganisation saw the Ministry merged with the Ministry of Health to form the Department of Health and Social Security. ==Ministry of Pensions== The Ministry of Pensions was created in 1916 to handle the payment of war pensions to former members of the Armed Forces and their dependants. It was expanded rapidly during the opening months of the Second World War by secondment of civil servants from the Inland Revenue and other government departments. In 1940 most of the Ministry was moved to Cleveleys and its close environs, in Lancashire. The Rossall School was taken over initially, but later several hundred employees worked in prefabricated one-storey office buildings assembled on a site that had been part of the Holt's farm in the Norcross section of Carleton. Sir Walter Womersley was the Minister during the war. Other ministers are listed under Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.

The seventh named storm and fourth typhoon of the season, Imbudo formed on July 15 to the east of the Philippines. The storm moved generally west-northward for much of its duration due to a ridge to the north. Favorable conditions allowed Imbudo to intensify, gradually at first before undergoing rapid deepening on July 19\\\\. After reaching typhoon status, Imbudo strengthened further to peak 10-minute sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) on July 20\\\\. The typhoon made landfall on northern Luzon near peak intensity on July 22, but quickly weakened over land. Once in the South China Sea, Imbudo re-intensified slightly before making its final landfall in southern China near Yangjiang on July 24, dissipating the next day. In the Philippines, Imbudo was the strongest typhoon in five years, causing widespread flooding and power outages in the Cagayan Valley for weeks. Damage was heaviest in Isabela province near where the storm struck. Most of the banana crop was destroyed, and other crops sustained similar but lesser damage. Imbudo disrupted transportation across much of Luzon. Nationwide, the storm damaged or destroyed 62,314 houses, causing P4.7 billion (PHP, $86 million USD) in damage, mostly in the Cagayan Valley. There were also 64 deaths in the country. In Hong Kong, strong winds killed a man after knocking him off a platform. In China, damage was heaviest in Guangdong where the storm struck. Thousands of trees fell, and 595,000 houses were wrecked. Hundreds of canceled flights stranded travelers across the region. In Guangxi, high rainfall increased water levels in 45 reservoirs to warning levels. In Guangxi and Guangdong, collectively 20 people were killed, and damage reached about ¥4.45 billion (CNY, US$297 million). ==Meteorological history== The origins of Imbudo were from a disorganized area of convection near Chuuk in the open western Pacific in mid-July. With weak wind shear, the system slowly became better organized. On July 15, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression formed. The next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert (TCFA), noting that outflow had increased due to an upper- level low to the northeast. At 1800 UTC on July 16, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 09W about 665 km (415 mi) east of Yap. A subtropical ridge near Okinawa steered the nascent depression to the west- northwest for much of its duration. With warm waters and favorable upper-level conditions, the depression quickly organized, and the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Imbudo on July 17. After becoming a tropical storm, Imbudo passed about 35 km (20 mi) north of Yap. The JMA upgraded Imbudo to a severe tropical storm late on July 18, around the same time that the JTWC upgraded it to a typhoon. An increase in outflow to the south and to the north from a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) caused a 36‑hour period of rapid development beginning on July 19. During that time, the JMA upgraded Imbudo to typhoon status, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories as the storm approached the Philippines, and a 30 km (20 mi) wide eye formed. At 1200 UTC on July 20, the JMA estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). At the same time, the JTWC estimated 1 minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), making it a super typhoon. By late on July 20, the typhoon had developed concentric eyewalls, and the TUTT was moving away, thus diminishing outflow. Imbudo maintained peak winds for about 12 hours, before the innermost eye contracted to a diameter of 11 km (7 mi) in the midst of an eyewall replacement cycle. At 0300 UTC on July 22, Imbudo struck northern Luzon, with 1 minute winds estimated at 205 km/h (125 mph) by the JTWC. Rapidly weakening over land, Imbudo emerged into the South China Sea about six hours after landfall. The JTWC estimated winds had decreased to 150 km/h (90 mph), although the agency estimated Imbudo quickly re-intensified to a secondary peak of 165 km/h (105 mph) in 1 minute winds. Dry air prevented convection from redeveloping significantly, and the eye had become large over open waters. At 0300 UTC on July 24, Imbudo made its final landfall west of Macau, near Yangjiang, Guangdong. It was the strongest to hit the province since Typhoon Sally in 1996, striking China with 10 minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph), as estimated by the JMA. The storm rapidly weakened over land while moving over southern China. Late on July 25, Imbudo dissipated near the border of China and Vietnam. ==Preparations== Before Imbudo struck, officials evacuated over 14,000 people to at least 60 shelters. Government offices were closed along the typhoon's path, and schools were closed in the capital, Manila. PAGASA issued a number 4 warning signal, the highest level, for three northern provinces, indicating the imminent threat of a powerful storm. Despite the warning, a post-storm survey in Isabela province indicated that 34% were unaware of the storm's arrival, while others believed the typhoon would not be as strong. In Manila, four flights were canceled at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, and the Manila Light Rail Transit System was shut down for two hours. Travel by ship and bus were halted in some areas. On July 22 before the storm struck, the Philippine military was put on red alert, increasing security at the presidential palace. The military stated it was due to the typhoon, although newspapers suggested it was to prevent a coup attempt; a failed coup ultimately did occur on July 27 in what would become known as the Oakwood mutiny. The Hong Kong Observatory issued a number 8 warning signal, indicating the potential for gale-force winds within the territory. At Hong Kong International Airport, at least 100 flights were canceled or delayed. Most ferry and some bus lines were temporarily suspended. The threat of the storm caused 16 flights to be canceled and another 54 delayed at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. On Hainan island, 32 canceled flights stranded about 1,500 travelers. The threat of the storm forced British Prime Minister Tony Blair to shorten a trip to the territory. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange opened 30 minutes late as a result of the typhoon. On the mainland at Yangjiang, more than 30,000 people evacuated ahead of the storm. ==Impact== ===Philippines=== Typhoon Imbudo over the Philippines on July 22 Typhoon Imbudo was the strongest typhoon to strike Luzon since Typhoon Zeb five years prior, and was the fifth storm in eight weeks to affect the country. The typhoon left widespread areas flooded for several days. Cagayan Valley was largely isolated after a bridge was damaged in Ilocos Norte. Damage was heavy in the region, totaling P2.2 billion (PHP, $40 million USD), and over 80,000 people were displaced by the storm. Damage was heaviest in Isabela, where damage was estimated at P1.9 billion (PHP, US$35 million), mostly to crops and killed livestock. There, winds and rain knocked down trees and caused a province-wide power outage. Most trees less than three years old fell during the high winds. In Isabela province, the banana crop was almost entirely destroyed, and most of the corn and rice crops were heavily damaged. The high damage caused the gross regional product, or overall economy of the Cagayan Valley, to decrease by 0.3% than what would have happened without the typhoon. Power outages affected Metro Manila, and several billboards were damaged in the city, although there was minimal flooding in the capital. Adverse conditions caused the Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1 to close for two hours, stranding hundreds. High winds knocked over a 12 m (40 ft) tree that killed five on Romblon Island. The rains brought the Magat Dam on Luzon to capacity. Landslides blocked a national highway in Nueva Ecija with debris and fallen trees, which were quickly cleared within a few days. On Mindanao, flash flooding from the outer periphery of the storm affected 18 towns, killing 11 people. In Maguindanao in the southern Philippines, flooding washed away 50 houses, forcing over 2,000 people to evacuate. Damage extended as far south as the Western Visayas. Across the Philippines, Imbudo damaged 62,314 houses, of which about 20% were destroyed. Housing damage was estimated at P1.2 billion (PHP, US$22 million), most of which in the Cagayan Valley. Overall damage in the country was estimated at about P4.7 billion (PHP, US$86 million). Of the total, about P1.9 billion (PHP, US$35 million) was in agriculture damage. Imbudo killed 64 people in the Philippines, mostly in Cagayan Valley, and injured another 154. ===Elsewhere=== Typhoon Imbudo in the South China Sea on July 23 Early in its developmental stages, Imbudo affected portions of Micronesia, particularly Ulithi. There, a weather station measured a peak wind gust of 85 km/h (53 mph); winds of similar intensity were reported in Yap. Rainfall from Imbudo in Micronesia peaked at 226 mm (8.89 in) over a six-hour period on Yap. The rainfall from the passing tropical cyclone caused $75,000 in property damage and $25,000 in agricultural and crop-related damage. Before Imbudo struck mainland China, it passed south of Taiwan, dropping heavy rainfall reaching in Taitung County. The outer rainbands reached as far as Okinawa, where was reported. Peak rainfall in Hong Kong was at Kwai Chung, only a day after Tropical Storm Koni dropped rainfall in the territory, and the highest storm surge was at Tsim Bei Tsui. As the storm passed to the south, Imbudo produced winds of on Cheung Chau, the highest in the Hong Kong territory, although a gust of was observed at Tai Mo Shan. High winds killed a man after knocking him off a platform. The winds knocked down 83 trees, injuring 11 people. Rough waves injured 34 people traveling by boat near Lantau Island. In the territory, ten boats were damaged or sank, and one fishing pier was damaged. At its final landfall in Guangdong, Imbudo produced strong winds, with a peak gust of 200 km/h (124 mph) measured at Shangchuan Island. At Yangjiang, gusts reached 159 km/h (99 mph), causing eleven boats to sink. There, over 10,000 trees fell due to the strong winds, more than half in the city, and 7,649 homes were damaged or destroyed. In Zhanjiang, the storm damaged power lines and water pumps, leaving residents without access to water. Imbudo spawned tornadoes in Luoding and Zhanjiang, damaging dozens of houses and killing 6,000 chickens. Throughout Guangdong, Imbudo destroyed 595,000 houses and caused ¥1.9 billion (CNY, US$230 million). There were at least eight deaths in the province. In Hainan island to the south of the storm track, rainfall reached in Ding'an County. Imbudo caused flooding in the capital Haikou, and several houses were wrecked. The typhoon affected most of the population, causing an estimated ¥55.35 million (CNY, US$6.7 million) in damage. Heavy rainfall spread across southern China, peaking at at Hepu County in Guangxi province, which increased water levels in 45 reservoirs to warning levels. The Nanliu River in Bobai County rose to , or above flood stage. In Guangxi, 12 people died from storm damage or drowning, and at least 130 livestock were killed. Imbudo destroyed 4,950 houses, 3,170 of which in the city of Yulin, causing ¥499.6 million (CNY, US$60.3 million) in damage in the province. Across southern China, the typhoon damaged over 10 million hectares (25 million acres) of crop fields. ==Aftermath== Immediately after the storm, the Philippine Air Force were mobilized to help deliver supplies and aid in search and rescue missions. On July 24, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared that the National Disaster Coordinating Council would provide assistance to citizens affected by the typhoon. The president requested P134 million (PHP, US$2.5 million) for farmers to buy new seeds, and P35 million (PHP, US$650,000) to rebuild the hard-hit Cagayan Valley, where Arroyo visited days after the storm struck. The government ultimately spent about P24 million (PHP, US$435,000) in emergency aid for relocating storm victims, search and rescue operations, and assistance. In Mindanao, officials prepared 800 bags of rice and various other food supplies due to the storm. Power and water outages persisted across Luzon for up to three weeks, causing many factories otherwise undamaged to close. In Isabela province, 25 Tzu Chi volunteers provided supplies to 2,873 houses. The Philippine government provided rice, sardines, and coffee to many affected houses. Damaged houses were supposed to receive 1,000 pesos, although few received the monetary aid. In the town of San Mariano in Isabela province, most farmers incurred more debt and continued their same general farming practice, despite sustaining heavy losses from the storm. ===Retirement=== In 2004, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Imbudo and replaced it with Molave. The PAGASA name Harurot was replaced with Hanna for the 2007 season. ==See also== *List of retired Pacific typhoon names (JMA) *Typhoon Parma *Typhoon Utor *Typhoon Rammasun ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center **Best Track Data of Typhoon Imbudo (0307) **Best Track Data (Graphics) of Typhoon Imbudo (0307) **Best Track Data (Text) *JMA General Information of Typhoon Imbudo (0307) from Digital Typhoon *JTWC Best Track Data of Super Typhoon 09W (Imbudo) *09W.IMBUDO from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory Category:Retired Pacific typhoons Category:2003 Pacific typhoon season Category:Typhoons in China Typhoon Imbudo Category:Typhoons Category:2003 disasters in the Philippines Category:Typhoons in the Philippines Imbudo ","title":"Typhoon Imbudo"},{"id":"3239599","text":"Hans D.

Buswell Jr.; Donald S. Lopez Jr. (2013). The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism. Princeton University Press. p. 142, Article on brahmaloka. . Phra Phrom is colloquially known outside Thailand as the ”Four-Faced Buddha” (四面佛, Sìmiànfó) or Four-Faced God (四面神 Simianshen) among Chinese folk religious worshipers, among whom the faith of this god has spread in the latest decades. One of the well-known Angkorian temple in Cambodia with the name of this Hindu deity is Ta Prom temple. ==Worship== === Cambodia === 10th century Khmer depiction of Brahma, Koh Ker style, Guimet Museum 11th century Khmer depiction of Trimurti from Angkor, Phnom Penh National Museum. Preah Prom or Brahma has been worshiped in Cambodia for thousands of years. Throughout the history of Cambodia, Brahma along with other Hindu deities were worshiped since Funan, Chenla, Angkor, and the present day. Cambodia was first influenced by Hinduism during the beginning of the Kingdom of Funan. A statue of Brahma was also found stationed in one of the shrines of the 7th-century Sambor Prey Kuk temple and is now exhibited at the Cambodia National Museum. Hinduism was one of the Khmer Empire's official religions. Cambodia is the home of the holy temple of Angkor Wat, the largest Hindu temple in the world. The main religion adhered to in the Khmer Kingdom was Hinduism, followed by Buddhism. Initially, the kingdom revered Hinduism as the main state religion. Today plenty of Brahma statues are exhibited in both the Cambodia and Foreign Museums. === Thailand === Worshipers of the god usually offer incense, candles, jasmine flowers or jasmine garlands and young coconut milk (with water in them) in their worship, usually placing these offerings before all four heads of Phra Phrom, each head representing a different aspect of the deity; it is believed each side of Phra Phrom offers different blessings. Another common way of worship is to place wooden elephant statues on the altar to honor him. Phra Phrom is also known to admire Thai classical music, which is played near larger scale outdoor altars, accompanied by dancers. For a small fee, the dancers include worshiper's name into the songs they sing while dancing. Worshipers of Phra Phrom are also usually advised to abstain from consuming meat. It is also believed that worshipers have to make good on any promises made to the deity else misfortune will befall them instead of the fortune that was asked for. Items needed for prayers are available in the premises of the shrine. The main example of this representation of Brahma is the statue at the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok, where the faith of the god has its origins in modern times. The golden dome of the Government House of Thailand also contains a statue of Phra Phrom. == Spread of the cult among ethnic Chinese == As early as the 1980s, the popularity of the Erawan cult of Brahma from its inceptions in Thailand spread, accompanied by faithful reproduction of the structure of the shrine and the image, among overseas Chinese in other countries of Southeast Asia (Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia), in Taiwan, and in China, with shrines established in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Guangzhou. ==See also== *Erawan *Spirit house *Wufang Shangdi *Yellow Emperor ===General articles=== *Greater India ==References== ==External links== * Main website of the Erawan Brahma faith * Four-Faced God faith in Hong Kong Category:Thai deities Category:Hinduism in Thailand Category:Fortune gods Category:Chinese folk religion ","title":"Phra Phrom"},{"id":"3239694","text":"\\"Heart and Soul\\" or \\"Heart & Soul\\" may refer to: ==Music== ===Albums=== *Heart & Soul (Teddy Edwards album), 1962 *\\"Heart and Soul\\" (Conway Twitty album), 1980 *Heart & Soul (Ron Carter and Cedar Walton album), 1982 *Heart & Soul (Joe Cocker album), 2004 *Heart and Soul (Steve Brookstein album), 2005 *Heart and Soul (Joy Division album), 1997 *Heart and Soul (Five Star album), 1995 *Heart & Soul (Kenny G album), 2010 *Heart & Soul (Johnny Adams album), 1969 *Heart & Soul (Ben E.

Coming from a poor peasant family, a participant in World War II, Alexander Zinoviev in the 1950s and 1960s was one of the symbols of the rebirth of philosophical thought in the Soviet Union. After the publication in the West of the screening book \\"Yawning Heights\\", which brought Zinoviev world fame, in 1978 he was expelled from the country and deprived of Soviet citizenship. He returned to Russia in 1999. The creative heritage of Zinoviev includes about 40 books, covers a number of areas of knowledge: sociology, social philosophy, mathematical logic, ethics, political thought. Most of his work is difficult to attribute to any direction, put in any framework, including academic. Having gained fame in the 1960s as a researcher of non-classical logic, in exile, Zinoviev was forced to become a professional writer, considering himself primarily a sociologist. Works in the original genre of \\"sociological novel\\" brought international recognition to Zinoviev. Often he is characterized as an independent Russian thinker, one of the largest, most original and controversial figures of Russian social thought of the second half of the 20th century. Anti-Stalinist in his youth, Zinoviev throughout his life held an active civil position, subjecting his works to sharp criticism at first the Soviet system, then the Russian and the Western, and at the end of life the processes of globalization. Zinoviev's worldview was distinguished by tragedy and pessimism. In the West, as in Russia, his non-conformist views were harshly criticized. ==Biography== ===Childhood and youth=== Alexander Alexandrovich Zinoviev was born in the village of Pakhtino in the Chukhlomsky District of Kostroma Province in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (now the Chukhlomsky District of the Kostroma Oblast). He was the sixth child of Alexander Yakovlevich Zinoviev, a worker, and Apollinaria Vasilyevna (born Smirnova). The ancestors of Zinoviev, first mentioned in mid-18th century documents, were state peasants. Zinoviev's father spent most of his time working in Moscow while living in the countryside. This gave him a Moscow residence permit, which probably saved his family from reprisals during the time of dekulakization. Before the revolution, Alexander Yakovlevich was an artist who decorated churches and painted icons, later expanding into finishing work and stencilling. Zinoviev somewhat disdainfully dismissed his father's profession as \\"painter.\\" Alexander Yakovlevich had a keen interest in art. He provided his children with art supplies, illustrated magazines, and books. Zinoviev's mother came from a wealthy family who owned property in Saint Petersburg. The Zinovievs, whose house stood in the center of the village, were respected in the district and often hosted guests. Biographers highlight the role of the mother in shaping Alexander's personality: Zinoviev recalled with love and respect her worldly wisdom and religious convictions, which determined the rules of behavior in the house. The family, however, was not religious. His father was a non-believer; his mother, although a believer, was indifferent to Church rites. From childhood, Alexander became a staunch atheist, looking all his life upon Orthodoxy, the church and its clergy with disgust. He considered atheism the only scientific component of Soviet Marxism. Alexander from early childhood stood out for his abilities, he was immediately transferred to the second class. As children grew older, their father took them to the capital. In 1933, after graduating from elementary school, Alexander, on the advice of a mathematics teacher, was sent to Moscow. He lived with relatives in a 10-meter basement room on Bolshaya Spasskaya Street. Due to the impracticality of his father, he had to deal with economic issues. Beggarly living conditions combined with interesting activities; in those years, the soviet state actively modernized school education, the reforms were accompanied by the propaganda of its social significance. Alexander studied successfully; he liked mathematics and literature most of all. The participation in the drawing circle did not work out – his drawings revealed the features of caricatures, the confusion happened with the redrawing of the portrait of Stalin for the Stalin's room; The experience in the drama club was also unsuccessful (Alexander didn't have a hearing or voice). He read a lot additionally, was a frequenter of libraries; he read classics, both domestic and foreign. In high school he was already familiar with a large number of philosophical works – from Voltaire, Diderot and Rousseau to Marx, Engels and Herzen. Of the Russian classics, Zinoviev particularly singled out Lermontov, knew by heart many of his poems; from modern authors – Mayakovsky. The most understandable and closest foreign writer was Hamsun (\\"Hunger\\"). As noted by the biographer Pavel Fokin, Zinoviev was attracted by the loneliness and pride of individualistic characters, which contributed to the formation of a sense of his own exclusiveness. He began to consciously cultivate this position of extreme individualism, although later he always denied it, calling himself \\"the ideal collectivist\\". As biographers noted, in his youth, Zinoviev was seized with the desire to \\"build a new world\\" and faith in a \\"bright future\\", he was fascinated by dreams of social justice, the ideas of equality and collectivism, material asceticism; his idols were Spartacus, Robespierre, Decembrists and Populists. As Konstantin Krylov wrote, the ideas corresponded to his personal experience: Zinoviev recalled that \\"he was a beggar among beggars\\", emphasizing that the communist utopia was the idea of beggars. On the one hand, the social, cultural and economic changes that occurred in the 1930s contributed to optimism; on the other hand, Alexander noticed and increasing inequality, saw how families of party and state officials live; drew attention to the fact that in the advancement of the social scale the most successful were activists, demagogues, talkers and scammers; observed the discrimination of the peasants in comparison with the working class, the degradation of the village and the formation of the new \\"serfdom\\" of the collective farms, which he witnessed when he came on holidays in Pakhtino. Impressed by the famous book of Radishchev, he wanted to write an accusatory \\"Journey from Chukhloma to Moscow\\"; in 1935, after the promulgation of the draft Stalin constitution, he jokingly made up a fictional constitution in which \\"idlers and stupids\\" had \\"the right to the same marks as the honors pupils\\" (the story caused a school scandal, but the matter was hushed up). As Pavel Fokin writes, \\"the exploits and meanness\\" of Soviet society, the contradictions and problems of everyday life provoked a \\"spiritual rebellion\\". According to the interpretation of Konstantin Krylov, disappointment in the practical implementation of the ideals of communism did not encourage young Zinoviev to deny the very idea of communism, or to search for other ideals. He chose the third way, concluding that evil is inevitably inherent in the social world, and that this world is essentially evil. This position later influenced his sociology. In the Komsomol Zinoviev was a member of the school committee, was responsible for the publication of a satirical newspaper. The choice of philosophy as a future specialty was influenced by a teacher of social sciences, a graduate student of the Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History – the main humanitarian university of those years in the Soviet Union. Together with his teacher, Alexander began to study the works of Marx and Engels, and was fascinated by dialectics. After graduating from school in 1939 with honors, he entered the Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History (other options were math and architecture). Among his fellow students were later well-known philosophers Arseny Gulyga, Igor Narsky, Dmitry Gorsky, Pavel Kopnin. The atmosphere at the institute, the forge of the \\"fighters of the ideological front\\", was heavy. Zinoviev was almost without funds, the meager scholarship was not enough, his father stopped helping him. As Pavel Fokin writes, Zinoviev was in a state of physical and nervous exhaustion. In search of an answer to the question of why the bright ideals of communism proclaimed were at variance with reality, Zinoviev thought about the figure of Stalin: \\"The Father of Nations\\" became the cause of the perversion of communist ideals. ===Early anti-Stalinism. War years=== According to the memoirs of Zinoviev, while still in school, he had the idea to kill Stalin, which he repeatedly discussed with close friends; The \\"plan\\" failed because they did not find a weapon. In Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History, at the next Komsomol meeting at the end of 1939, Zinoviev emotionally spoke about the troubles and injustices that took place in the village, openly criticized the personality cult of Stalin. Zinoviev was sent for a psychiatric examination, and then expelled from the Komsomol and Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History. According to his memoirs, he was arrested and interrogated at the Lubyanka. Zinoviev recalled that the investigators were confident that someone had inspired his views to him, so they planned to let him go to reveal the entire anti-Soviet group. When transferred to one of the apartments of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, Zinoviev managed to escape. He hid in different places: he left for Pakhtino for a while, then he wandered, and later returned to Moscow. At the end of 1940 he joined the Red Army to avoid persecution. In the military enlistment office he called himself \\"Zenoviev\\", saying that he had lost his passport. Subsequently, Zinoviev often returned to this story, including in his memoirs \\"The Confession of the Outcast\\", calling that year the \\"year of horror\\". This episode of the biography is in general terms mentioned in encyclopedic publications, its credibility is generally not questioned by biographers and commentators. Pavel Fokin pointed out that the arrest and search documents were not kept, therefore it is difficult to establish the exact chronology of events.According to Viktor Sheinis, a member of the Congress of People’s Deputies of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, in 1990, by order of Vladimir Kryuchkov, 35 volumes of the Zinoviev case were destroyed. Pavel Fokin considers it possible that among them were the documents of 1939. Western commentators suggest that the documents were lost during the chaos of the outbreak of war in 1941. Konstantin Krylov noted that sincerity and lack of heroism in the descriptions of events testify in favor of their authenticity. A Swiss literary critic Georges Niva believed that Zinoviev later constructed his biography around the complex of a terrorist whose rebellion remained imaginary. As a result, his whole life became a fierce resistance to the course of history, in this context it does not matter whether the murder of Stalin was planned in reality. Zinoviev spent most of the war at the Ulyanovsk Aviation School. Initially he served in the Primorsky Territory as part of the cavalry division. In the spring of 1941, the troops were transferred to the west, he was credited with a tank gunner in a tank regiment. On the eve of June 22, the advanced unit was sent to a flight school in Orsha, which was soon evacuated to Gorky, and in early 1942 to the Ulyanovsk military aviation school of pilots. At the aviation school, Zinoviev spent almost three years, mostly in reserve. He learned to fly a biplane, later – on the Il-2. In Ulyanovsk, he had a son, named Valery (1944). He graduated from the aviation school at the end of 1944 and received the title of \\"junior lieutenant\\". He fought in the 2nd Guards Ground Attack Aviation Corps, the first combat flight on the IL-2 took place in March 1945 during the capture of Glogau. Participated in battles in Poland and Germany, was awarded the Order of the Red Star. The war ended in Grassau on May 8. Zinoviev recalled that the flights were enjoyable: I liked to feel like the owner of a combat vehicle, drop bombs, shoot cannons and machine guns; the fear of perishing was relieved by the realization that \\"this is only once\\". After the war, he served a year on the territory of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria. Zinoviev was frustrated by the senselessness of military service, repeatedly tried to quit, but failed. Six years in the army gave Zinoviev rich material for understanding Soviet society, monitoring social relations and dynamics, the army represented a large-scale social laboratory, in which features of social processes were manifested or even caricatured. ===Moscow State University and postgraduate period (1946–1954)=== After his dismissal from the army in 1946, Zinoviev took his mother and younger brothers from the village to Moscow. He managed to recover at the Faculty of Philosophy of Moscow State University, with which Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History was united. He had to look for odd jobs – the scholarship was not enough. During his studies, Zinoviev managed to work as a loader, excavator, watchman, was engaged in the manufacture of fake bread cards and donated blood. In 1950–1952 he taught logic and psychology at school. He originally did not plan a philosophical career, he thought of becoming a writer. He wrote \\"A Tale of Duty\\" (or \\"A Tale of Betrayal\\"), the main character of which was an informant – \\"a whistleblower of enemies\\". Zinoviev took the manuscript to the magazine \\"October\\", where Vasily Ilyenkov, the father of Evald Ilyenkov, worked, and to the \\"New World\\", headed by Konstantin Simonov. Reviews of the reviewers were negative, and Zinoviev destroyed the manuscript on the advice of Simonov. As Pavel Fokin writes, the failure had a strong effect on Zinoviev, he led an unbridled lifestyle: he drank, did not follow his health. The work in the wall newspaper helped him to overcome the situation and focus on philosophy, where he began writing epigrams, parodies, humorous poems, and wrote colorful “life stories” that, Pavel Fokin noted, seemed so plausible that even the author sometimes believed in them. In the post-war years, the faculty of philosophy was \\"on the forefront\\" of the ideological front – the \\"biggest event\\" was the speech of the secretary of the Central Committee Andrei Zhdanov (1947), followed by the strengthening of the party's role in philosophical education. Conferences were held to study the work of Stalin, in 1948 the tenth anniversary of the \\"brilliant Stalinist work\\" – \\"A Short Course in the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)\\" was widely celebrated. Zinoviev studied mostly \\"excellently\\", mastering Marxist texts was not a big deal; he studied Kant, Marx and Hegel before the war. Teachers were the subject of his ridicule and satirical caricatures popular among students, his aphorisms were part of philosophical folklore; he was inclined to self-irony. According to the memoirs of Vadim Mezhuyev, Zinoviev won the competition for the best definition of matter: \\"matter is an objective reality given to us in sensations by God\\". Zinoviev ironically recalled how the \\"tongue-tied marazmatik Bugaev\\" from the first classes inspired students with superiority over all the previous philosophy; another object of ridicule, Beletsky, pointed out through a window to \\"objective truth\\" – the Kremlin. The exception was the historian of philosophy, Valentin Asmus, with him Zinoviev had a warm relationship all his life. The closest friend of the not too sentimental Zinoviev was Karl Kantor. Friendship with Evald Ilyenkov, who studied for an older course, rather represented rivalry: both were intellectual leaders of student companies (theoretical conversations were often held in eateries), which were later added by Boris Grushin, Merab Mamardashvili, Georgy Shchedrovitsky, Alexander Piatigorsky, Len Karpinsky, Yuri Karyakin, Yuri Levada. According to the memoirs of Pyatigorsky, Zinoviev \\"became everything for me at the faculty\\". As Karl Kantor wrote, Zinoviev did not have a specific subject, he taught the critical view of the dogmatism of the Marxist–Leninist curriculum, considered habitual topics from a new, often unexpected angle. His penchant for independent thinking attracted both students and graduate students, sometimes even teachers, including Asmus. Karl Kantor recalled: In everyday life, Zinoviev did not hide the anti-Stalinist views, openly and consistently condemning, for example, the anti-Semitic campaign. As Alexander Pyatigorsky recalled, Zinoviev \\"was not afraid of anything\\"; he was one of the few who continued to communicate with Karl Kantor in the midst of the struggle against cosmopolitanism, demonstratively releasing \\"anti-Semitic\\" jokes about his friend. Georgy Shchedrovitsky recalled that Zinoviev hated Soviet socialism, in which socialist principles superimposed on archaic social structures (mass bonded labor and camps), but which corresponded to the national character and cultural traditions. Pessimism was intensified by the fact that socialism was considered as the inevitable and unalternative future of mankind. In future society, Zinoviev did not see a place for himself, because he did not consider himself to be in any class and believed that he had survived by a miracle. Konstantin Krylov, commenting on Shchedrovitsky's memories, referred Zinoviev to the victims of the Russian Revolution and contrasted him in this sense to Shchedrovitsky, who recognized that his personal prospects were more optimistic because of social status. In the third year Zinoviev became interested in the logic of Capital, Marx was devoted to his diploma. After graduating in 1951 with honors from the university, he entered graduate school. In Capital, Zinoviev was interested in the logical structure, rather than the economic or political description of capitalism, the dissertation considered the logical techniques used by Marx. In Soviet dogma, the subject of Zinoviev's research, like that of Ilyenkov's similar research, was called \\"dialectical logic\\". Vladislav Lektorsky connects the turn of Zinoviev and Ilyenkov to the study of theoretical thinking and methodology with the conviction that strict knowledge can influence bureaucratic \\"real socialism\\" and reform the Soviet system. According to Pavel Fokin, appeal to logic was an act of self-preservation in the conditions of Soviet reality, unwillingness to engage in ideological propaganda within the framework of historical materialism – logic was outside of party or class interests. In 1952, Zinoviev and his students Grushin, Mamardashvili and Shchedrovitsky established the Moscow Logic Circle. The participants tried to develop a so-called \\"genetically meaningful\\" logic – an alternative to both semi-official dialectical logic and formal logic. The activity of the circle took place against the backdrop of the revival of the atmosphere at the philosophical faculty after Stalin's death. At the beginning of 1954, a discussion was held on \\"Disagreements on Logic Issues\\", which divided \\"dialecticians\\", formal logicians and \\"heretics\\" from the circle – the so- called \\"easel painters\\". In another discussion, Zinoviev said a well-known phrase that \\"earlier bourgeois philosophers explained the world, and now Soviet philosophers do not do this\\", which caused the applause of the audience. After discussions, members of the group were summoned to the Committee for State Security, but there was no repression. Zinoviev's Ph.D. thesis \\"The Method of Ascent from the Abstract to the Concrete (on the Material of Karl Marx's \\"Capital\\") was twice \\"filled up\\" at the Faculty Academic Council, it was possible to defend oneself from the third time, already in Higher Attestation Commission, in September 1954. The opposition of the \\"old men\\" was counterbalanced by the support of the Minister of Culture Academician George Alexandrov, which he managed to get through Karl Kantor. The opponents were Teodor Oizerman and Pavel Kopnin, the post-graduate students Mamardashvili and Grushin and Schedrovitsky supported the defense of Zinoviev. The text of the dissertation was later distributed in numerous reprints in samizdat and was published only in 2002. The peripetias of those events Zinoviev grotesque described in the novel \\"On the Eve of Paradise\\". In 1951, Zinoviev married, in 1954, his daughter Tamara was born, a year later, the couple received a small room in a communal flat. The marriage was partly calculated (Tamara Filatieva was the daughter of a People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs worker), partly out of love, but family life did not work out – each had their own professional interests, and misunderstanding increased. The situation was aggravated by the continued drunkenness of Zinoviev. ===Career takeoff: science and teaching (1955–1968)=== Zinoviev gradually lost interest in the logical circle, where Shchedrovitsky moved to the role of leader. Zinoviev had his own ambitions, he was not satisfied with the \\"collective farm\\" and \\"party\\" model circle (as per Pavel Fokin). In 1955, he received the position of junior researcher at the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union (sector of dialectical materialism), where he felt comfortable. The institute was primarily an ideological institution with rigid orders, but a certain revival (as described by Vladislav Lektorsky) of philosophical thought in the 1950s made it possible to pursue science, including in the field of logic, which Zinoviev recognized. In the second half of the 1950s, the formation of logical science took place,Formal logic as a scientific discipline was abolished in the early 1920s and recreated in the 1940s. textbooks, collections, collective monographs were published, and methodological seminars were held. Zinoviev was actively involved in scientific work, but the first articles were rejected at sector meetings, which, according to Pavel Fokin, was an echo of the story of Ilyenkov, who was then persecuted. Group mates (Mamardashvili and others) considered the choice of mathematical logic as an academic career as a departure from the struggle in the direction of security and well-being; Zinoviev's disciple Yury Solodukhin drew attention to his disappointment in the speculative nature of Marxism. right The first publications took place in 1957, a year later one of the articles was published in Czech. For fifteen years (1960–1975) Zinoviev published a number of monographs and many articles on non-classical logic. Academic career developed rapidly: in 1960, Zinoviev became a senior researcher, in November 1962, by unanimous decision of the Academic Council of the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, received a doctorate for his study \\"The logic of statements and the theory of inference\\". Opponents of the defense were Valentin Asmus, Sofya Yanovskaya and Igor Narsky. In 1958–1960, he read the special course \\"The Philosophical Problems of Natural Science\\" at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, since 1961 – the special course at Moscow State University (faculty of philosophy). In 1966 he received the title of professor, in 1967–1968, part-time headed the department of logic, Faculty of Philosophy, Moscow State University. In 1968, he joined the editorial board of the journal Problems of Philosophy, a year later – on the Academic Council on the problems of dialectical materialism of the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. By the mid-1970s, his works were published in English, German, Italian, and Polish. Zinoviev was engaged in logic not just as a scientific discipline, but reconsidered its foundations as part of the creation of a new field of intellectual activity. According to Konstantin Krylov, he experienced a temporary stage of creating a \\"general theory of everything\\", which, however, he quickly passed. It is noted that in logical studies Zinoviev was clearly vain, which led to imprudent steps and embarrassment: for example, he insistently published proof of Fermat's unprovability in the framework of the logical system he built. At Moscow State University, Zinoviev formed a group of followers from domestic and foreign students and graduate students. Listeners recalled that Zinoviev was impressive with his erudition, his classes were not \\"lectures on paper\\", but improvisations on a given topic, offering a systematic vision of the problem, a dynamic creative search. According to the memoirs of the physicist Peter Barashev, who studied at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Zinoviev forced to read the originals of the original sources, evaluate each text used, look for not only the strengths, but also the weaknesses of scientific works. He rather sharply and emotionally criticized his predecessors and opponents, but he treated students warmly, seeing them as like-minded people, communicated informally, took them to exhibitions, to the cinema, to cafes. Listener of Zinoviev Valery Rhodes recalled: A successful career was overshadowed by the fact that Zinoviev was in fact \\"restricted to leave\\", although the scientist was repeatedly invited to foreign events. His candidacy for international travel was usually wrapped up at various stages, starting in 1961, when he was not given a visa to Poland. Scientific work did not interfere with observing and analyzing social reality, primarily using the example of the Institute of Philosophy, as well as engaging in ethical searches, introspection and self-reflection. In the first half of the 1960s, he formulated an ethical position about the complete independence of his personality from society. Around 1963, it was possible to overcome alcohol dependence, which lasted throughout the postwar years; in the same year he divorced. In 1965 he got acquainted with stenographer Olga Sorokina, who was 23 years younger, four years later they got married. Olga Mironovna became his faithful ally for life; Zinoviev often spoke of her invaluable help and support. The daughters of Polina (1971) and Xenia (1990) were born in marriage. In 1967, Zinoviev was not released to the international congress on logic in Amsterdam, although he was included in the official composition of the Soviet delegation. Long-term participation in philosophical \\"gatherings..., in which he spoke with negative views on certain issues of the theory of Marxism-Leninism\\" (Committee for State Security analytical note) and contacts with American logicians in 1960, according to the Committee for State Security who worked for American intelligence, had their effect. The Organs confined themselves to a conversation (Zinoviev insisted that communication with the Americans had exclusively professional goals), which ended in a curiosity: having learned that he was renting a room, he was given a one-room apartment on Vavilova Street. In the early 1970s, having made an exchange, the Zinovievs moved into a four-room apartment, he had his own office. Later, Zinoviev remarked: \\"The improvement of living conditions played a huge role in the growth of opposition and rebellious attitudes in the country\\". ===Dissident Zinoviev. \\"Yawning Heights\\"=== In scientific and teaching activities, Zinoviev openly ignored the official ideology, in the late 1960s his position in the scientific community deteriorated. As Pavel Fokin writes, he declined the proposal of the Vice-President of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, Peter Fedoseyev, to write a \\"Marxist-Leninist\\" article for the journal Kommunist, although he was promised his own department and election as a corresponding member. The scientist was in conflict with representatives of the \\"liberal\\" wing of the Soviet intelligentsia, and, as biographers believe, their attitude towards Zinoviev was worse than that of the orthodox communists. In the \\"liberal\\" composition of the editorial board of the journal Problems of Philosophy (Merab Mamardashvili, Bonifaty Kedrov, Theodor Oizerman, Yuri Zamoshkin, Vladislav Kelle) took an extremely sharp position on the quality of the reviewed works, indignant at the authors raid over Leonid Brezhnev; Zinoviev noted \\"()\\" – \\"()\\" – to texts that could not be criticized. After the suspension of his publications, Zinoviev left the editorial board. In the fall of 1968, he was fired from the post of head of the department of logic at Moscow State University. He openly made friends with the well-known dissident Alexander Esenin-Volpin, inviting him to seminars on logic, and with Ernst Neizvestny, who he often visited. He continued his scientific activities, preparing graduate students. In 1973 he was not re-elected to the Academic Council of the Institute, a year later he was not allowed to speak at the All-Union Symposium on the theory of logical inference; they were not allowed to travel abroad, in particular, to Finland and Canada; problems arose with his graduate students. At the same time, Zinoviev was elected a foreign member of the Finnish Academy of Sciences (1974) after a visit to the Soviet Union by the famous Finnish logician Georg von Wright. Zinoviev was proud of this fact, Finnish logic had a high scientific authority. After the Prague events, Zinoviev came up with the idea of a satirical book about Soviet reality. The book, entitled \\"Yawning Heights\\", has grown from a series of articles written in the early 1970s; among them – an essay about Ernst Neizvestny, dedicated to the fate of talent in society. Then he began to paint. Forwarded articles to the West, they were published in Poland and Czechoslovakia, unsigned articles were distributed in samizdat. The main part of the book was conspiratorially written in a removable cottage in Peredelkino in the summer of 1974 and was completed by early 1975. Zinoviev wrote cleanly, the wife played the role of proofreader and editor. With the help of acquaintances, the manuscript (almost a thousand typewritten pages) was sent to France. Zinoviev did not count on a quick publication, for various reasons all Russian-language publishing houses rejected the manuscript. The publisher was Vladimir Dmitrievich, a Serb who popularized Russian literature for the French-speaking reader; he accidentally saw the manuscript, and he really liked it. Shortly before publication after another refusal of a trip abroad (logical colloquium in Finland) in June 1976, Zinoviev went into open conflict with the authorities. He invited Western journalists to his home and made a protest statement, and then turned in a party card at the Institute of Philosophy. The change was accompanied by comical circumstances: the party secretary, being an ideological communist, tried to dissuade Zinoviev from his step, refusing to accept the party membership card. Taking Zinoviev out of the office, he locked himself and several times pushed the document under the door. \\"Yawning Heights\\" represented a keen satire on the Soviet way of life. In August 1976, the book was published in Russian in the Lausanne publishing house of Dmitrievich \\"L'Âge d’homme\\". The publication was accompanied by lighting on the radio, the book was advertised by the emigre writer Vladimir Maximov. \\"Yawning Heights\\" had success with the Western reader, the novel was translated into two dozen languages. Reviews of reviewers in different countries were generally positive, sometimes even enthusiastic, the novel received several awards, in particular the European Charles Weyonne Prize for essay. The book was considered as a literary event out of touch with the Soviet context. Zinoviev was called the heir to the satirical tradition – from Aristophanes and Apuleius through François Rabelais and Jonathan Swift to Saltykov-Shchedrin, Anatole France, Franz Kafka and George Orwell. Among dissidents, the reaction was more heterogeneous, there were also negative opinions, for example, among Andrei Sakharov, who called the book decadent, or Alexander Solzhenitsyn. In the Soviet Union, the book was immediately declared anti-Soviet, its reading was equated with anti-Soviet activity; \\"Yawning Heights\\" were actively distributed in samizdat. As Lev Mitrokhin recalled, despite the flaws, the book made a strong impression by \\"author's ingenuity, imagery, accuracy of social diagnosis, and violent black humor\\". Many intellectuals, for example, mocked in the novel Mamardashvili, considered the book a libel or even a denunciation. On December 2, 1976, he was expelled from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at the general institute party meeting (Zinoviev did not show up for it), and then deprived of scientific titles for \\"anti-patriotic actions incompatible with the title of Soviet scientist\\" and dismissed from the Institute of Philosophy. In early 1977, by decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Zinoviev was deprived of all state awards, including military, and academic degrees. He was even expelled from the Philosophical Society, of which he was not a member. Relatives were also affected: the son Valery and daughter Tamara lost their jobs; Brother Vasily, a military lawyer with the rank of lieutenant colonel, refused to publicly condemn his brother, for which he was dismissed from the army and expelled from Moscow. Zinoviev was left without a livelihood, he sold books and albums from his home collection, illegally edited scientific texts, and sometimes well-wishers helped financially, for example, Pyotr Kapitsa. Numerous dissidents and foreign journalists actively talked with Zinoviev (Raisa Lehrth, Sofiya Kalistratova, Roy Medvedev, Peter Abovin-Egides, Vladimir Voinovich and others). As stated in a note by the Committee for State Security for the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, signed by Yuri Andropov, Zinoviev received at home \\"anti-Soviet-minded individuals\\" and \\"renegades\\",Probably, Venedikt Yerofeyev, George Vladimov, Slava Lyon. discussed \\"anti-Soviet actions\\",The exhibition of works by Mikhail Shemyakin. gave \\"slanderous information\\" to correspondents of capitalist countries to \\"attract attention to his person\\". Zinoviev continued to write, soon finishing the story \\"The Night Watchman's Notes\\", the novel \\"On the Eve of Paradise\\" and the novel \\"A Bright Future\\", published in Switzerland in early 1978. ===In emigration: against \\"real communism\\"=== The novel \\"A Bright Future\\" contained personal insults to the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Leonid Brezhnev. In June 1978, at the suggestion of the Committee for State Security, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union made a rather mild decision to expel Zinoviev abroad. According to the Committee for State Security note, criminal prosecution would lead to placement in a psychiatric institution (Zinoviev was characterized as a \\"mentally unstable\\" former alcoholic suffering from \\"delusions of grandeur\\"), which was considered inexpedient because of the campaign against Soviet psychiatry in the West. Zinoviev received invitations from universities in Europe and the United States, in particular, from the president of the University of Munich philosopher Nikolaus Lobkowitz, who knew his logical works. Zinoviev was supported by the Austrian Federal Chancellor Bruno Kreisky and the German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who touched upon his fate at a meeting with Leonid Brezhnev. On August 6, 1978, Zinoviev, with his wife and seven-year-old daughter, left for Germany. At the first press conference in Munich, which attracted a lot of attention from the press, Zinoviev said that he did not feel that he was a \\"victim of the regime\\", but considered the regime to be his victim. He distanced himself from the human rights and dissident movement and critically assessed the possibilities of democratization in the Soviet Union. Shortly after these statements, a decree was issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to deprive Zinoviev of Soviet citizenship. From August 1978 to July 1999 he lived with his family in Munich, earned literary work and public lectures, not having a stable place of work. He briefly taught logic at the University of Munich; his presence as a lecturer being rather political in nature. After the \\"Bright Future\\" (Medici Award for the Best Foreign Book of the Year in France) for several years, \\"scientific and literary\\" novels and novels \\"Night Watchman's Notes\\", \\"On the Eve of Paradise\\", \\"Yellow House\\", and \\"Homo Sovieticus\\" were published, \\"Go to Golgatha\\", \\"The Wings of Our Youth\\" and others. Theoretical reflections on Soviet society compiled the book Communism as Reality (Alexis de Tocqueville Prize for Humanism). Zinoviev worked daily, wrote almost without drafts. Text fragments were thought out in advance, often during walks, lectures or conversations. By his own admission, he worked erratically, but continuously. A dozen reviews were published for each book in France, Germany and Italy, the books were well received by Western readers, with whom Zinoviev often met. In 1980, he admitted that he did not expect to meet such a thoughtful and understanding reader in the West. The books were published in many European languages, in Japan and the US, where the \\"Yawning Heights\\" were published in 1979. In addition to literary awards, he received public awards: he was elected a member of the Roman Academy of Sciences, the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts. In 1984, the documentary film \\"Alexander Zinoviev. Reflections of the writer in exile\\", in Munich, an exhibition of his paintings and cartoons. In 1986, a conference on his work was held in London. In the first half of the 1980s, Zinoviev led an active public activities, enjoyed great popularity in the media, especially in France, Germany and Italy. He was almost the main newsmaker of Russian emigration. Publications of his books in different countries were published quarterly, Zinoviev participated in presentations, attended various congresses and symposia, where he gave reports, participated in conversations, gave interviews. Eduard Limonov recalled: Numerous speeches and journalistic articles made up the collections \\"We and the West\\", \\"Without Illusions\\", \\"Neither Freedom, nor Equality, nor Brotherhood\\". Zinoviev defended his understanding of the Soviet system, wrote a lot about the relationship between capitalism and communism, the West and the East. He criticized the West for underestimating the communist threat due to a lack of understanding of the nature of Soviet society. The West assessed the Soviet system through its own criteria, however, Zinoviev argued that Western democracy and communism are completely different. He denied the role of the personal qualities of the Soviet leaders, considering them \\"social symbols\\", and urged the West not to listen to their promises. In 1983, in his report \\"Marxist ideology and religion\\" at a symposium in Vienna, he asserted that \\"spiritual rebirth\\" in the Soviet Union would not affect the official ideology, and Andropov's policy would not lead to reforms or social protest. A year later, in a series of representative events dedicated to Orwell's 1984 novel, he sharply criticized the adequacy of the description in the book of the communist society. From his point of view, the book was not a scientific prediction, but reflected Orwell's contemporaries' fear of imaginary communism. In emigration, Zinoviev felt alone, despite his popularity, dynamic life and relative comfort – he lived in a three-room apartment on the very outskirts of Munich, his earnings by European standards were rather modest. Zinoviev tried to avoid the emigrant community, close relations were formed only with Vladimir Maximov; European intellectuals were friends with Friedrich Dürrenmatt. The language barrier was also a problem - Zinoviev mastered professional vocabulary, but on the whole, he did not know German well, spoke mainly in English. The expression of loneliness became the oil painting \\"Self-portrait\\", according to Pavel Fokin, the image of suffering, pain, truth and hopelessness. In the essay \\"Why I will never return to the Soviet Union\\" (1984), nostalgia and the desire to return to Russia were combined with the realization that \\"there is nowhere to return, there is no need to return, there is no one to return\\"; in 1988, in an interview with Radio Liberty, he stated that he considered his emigration a punishment, and his principle was \\"always to write the truth and only the truth\\". According to Georges Niva, Zinoviev grew nostalgia for collectivist communism, he paradoxically turned from the accuser of communism into his apologist, which was manifested in the novel \\"The Wings of Our Youth\\". In the book, as in a number of speeches, Zinoviev argued that after 1953 he ceased to be an anti-Stalinist, because he understood that Stalinism arose \\"from below\\" and was not a product of Stalin. ===The Catastroika and the 1990s=== Zinoviev took Perestroika in a sharply negative way, calling it \\"Catastroika\\". Mikhail Gorbachev and his associates were described as demagogues, hypocrites, cynical careerists and \\"insignificance\\" who had no scientific understanding of the nature of Soviet communism. Since 1985, in numerous articles and speeches, he asserted that the social system in the Soviet Union will not change, restructuring he considered bureaucratic formality, and her initiatives – from glasnost to the anti-alcohol campaign – a manifestation of the leadership's inability to adequately assess real problems. From his point of view, the \\"revolution from above\\", carried out with the support of the indifferent to the fate of ordinary Soviet people of the West, could only lead to a catastrophe. This \\"attack on Gorbachev\\" provoked a negative reaction from the majority of intellectuals in the West, who welcomed the restructuring. Zinoviev's views were explained by eccentricities, outrageous, even madness. Controversial articles and interviews compiled a collection of \\"Gorbachevism\\"; The book \\"Catastroika\\" (1989) described the provincial \\"Party City\\", where officials, driven by vested interests, imitate the implementation of reforms. In 1987 and 1989, Zinoviev visited Chile twice; during his second trip, he was accepted by Augusto Pinochet. He conducted a lecture tour of the United States, a series of successful creative evenings in Israel. The attention of the press was attracted by the exhibition of drawings \\"Allegra Rusia\\" (\\"Fun of Russia\\") on the topic of Soviet drunkenness, held in Milan in 1989. The project was a \\"conceptual sociological comic\\" (as per Pavel Fokin). At the suggestion of French publishers wrote a memoir entitled \\"The Confession of the Outcast\\". The book combined biographical memories and sociological and philosophical reflections. As a critic of Gorbachev and the restructuring of Zinoviev in March 1990, he was invited to a debate on the French TV channel with \\"disgraced\\" Boris Yeltsin, then the Soviet Union People's Deputy, little- known in Europe. Zinoviev criticized Yeltsin's desire to \\"speed up\\" the restructuring, said he saw the character of his books in him, and called his promises about the abolition of privileges demagogic and unfulfilled. Pavel Fokin noted that in his assessments Zinoviev hyperbolized Gorbachev's political role in the Soviet Union, without noticing Yeltsin's figure. After the debate, interest in Zinoviev arose in Moscow, which was full of political events, and his articles and interviews began to appear in the Soviet press. On July 1, 1990, by decree of the President of the Soviet Union, Zinoviev was restored to Soviet citizenship, to which he reacted without enthusiasm, explaining that publishing his books was important for him. In 1990 in the Soviet Union with a circulation of 250 thousand copies \\"Yawning Heights\\" were released, in 1991 the novels \\"Homo Soveticus\\", \\"Para Bellum\\" and \\"Go to Golgatha\\" were published (in the magazine \\"Smena\\"); at the same time, the Higher Attestation Commission restored his academic degrees. In the article \\"I want to tell you about the West\\", published in Komsomolskaya Pravda (1990), Zinoviev spoke with contempt of the \\"brave men\\" who \\"spit on everything Soviet\\", but distanced themselves from the defenders of Soviet history; he criticized the idealization of the image of the West, arguing that Western notions of market, democracy, multi-party system are inadequate to Soviet conditions and even destructive. In a response to the polemical article by Mark Zakharov entitled \\"Come back, mate!\\", the author sarcastically suggested that Zinoviev leave the world of \\"moneybags and exploiters\\" and return from the \\"wicked West\\" in the Soviet Union. The article outlined the themes of the numerous speeches of Zinoviev in the 1990s, mainly in the opposition press of the Yeltsin regime in the Russian press, as well as his critical analysis of the modern West and globalization processes in the books West, Global Human Rights and On the Road to Super-Society. In the conflict of the \\"democrats\\" with the \\"red-brown\\" he took the position of defender of Soviet communism, describing the Soviet period as the pinnacle of Russian history. The defeat of the State Committee on the State of Emergency Zinoviev called the historical tragedy and negatively evaluated the collapse of the Soviet Union; about Yeltsin and Russian reformers, he repeatedly spoke disparagingly, used extremely harsh expressions (\\"idiots\\", \\"scum\\", \\"cretins\\", \\"elitsinoidy\\", etc.), demanding punitive measures against them. At the presentation in Rome of the Italian literary prize \\"Tevere\\" in 1992,For the novel \\"Live\\" as the best book of the year. he denied the possibility of success of Russian reforms, believing that they would only lead to a catastrophe. At the same time, he called Stalin the only great politician in the history of Russia, which, Konstantin Krylov notes, was not at all praise, but shocked the public. In a number of speeches, he argued that Russia would never become a Western country; called the Russian regime \\"colonial democracy\\", and Westernization – a special form of colonization, aimed at defeating and disintegrating Russia in the interests of the West. After another interview (1994) in the newspaper \\"Zavtra\\", where Zinoviev openly called for the overthrow of the anti-people regime \\"traitors and collaborators\\", a criminal case was opened against his interviewer, Vladimir Bondarenko. Zinoviev had to explain that his words expressed the position of a scientist, not a politician. ===Return to Russia and last years=== From the mid-1990s, Zinoviev began to visit his homeland more often, he had supporters and followers with whom he willingly communicated. In 1996, he confessed that he was not going to return to Russia that was \\"hostile\\", despite the publication of his books (Embroilment, Russian Experiment, etc.). He believed that he was \\"boycotted\\" in Russia, as, incidentally, in the West, where he managed to publish with difficulty. Nevertheless, in France, in the publishing house \\"Plon\\" in 1996 \\"West\\" was released, two years later in Italy it became the bestseller \\"The Global Humant Hill\\". As Pavel Fokin writes, the turning point was the fall of 1997, when he visited Russia several times. Zinoviev represented the \\"Global Humant Hill\\" in Moscow, held a series of meetings with Sergey Baburin, Nikolai Ryzhkov and Gennady Zyuganov. Zinoviev called for a vote for the Communist leader in the 1996 presidential election, considering the Communist Party of the Russian Federation one of the few positive political forces in the country, although his position was more radical than that of the parliamentary Communist opposition. Zinoviev's 75th anniversary was celebrated at the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences and at the Institute of Philosophy; he visited his native Kostroma Region, and in 1998 made a number of trips around Russia and the CIS. On June 30, 1999, the Zinoviev family returned to Moscow. A few days later he was accepted as a professor at Moscow State University (Department of Ethics at the Faculty of Philosophy) and Maxim Gorky Literature Institute. At the end of the year, at the suggestion of Baburin, he agreed to participate in the Duma elections on the list of the Russian All-People's Union, but was not registered. The decision to return was influenced by the bombing of Yugoslavia, which Zinoviev repeatedly condemned. He believed that the war in the Balkans is being waged against Europe, which means its degradation and marks the arrival of a new, post-democratic and post-communist totalitarianism. In the last Western interview \\"Why I am returning to Russia\\", published in \\"Le Monde\\", Zinoviev stated catastrophic changes in the West and in Russia, the surrender of Europe before Americanization and globalization, its betrayal of its ideals (democracy, freedom of speech, moral values, etc.). He stated that, returning to Russia, he remains committed to genuine European values. Slobodan Milošević (the philosopher met him in 1999), like Muammar Gaddafi, symbolized for Zinoviev the challenge and resistance of globalization, insubordination to America, caused his admiration and respect. Autograph of Alexander Zinoviev (1995) Zinoviev spoke positively about Vladimir Putin, pinned great hopes on him, considering his coming to power as the country's first chance after 1985 to break the deadlock and to resist Westernization and colonization. However, he rather quickly revised optimistic estimates, noting at the end of 2000 that Russia continued to lose ground, although he did not rank Putin as a \\"traitor\\". In 2002, he wrote that Putin, having popular support, did not use the historical chance, refusing to revise the results of privatization and nationalize finance and energy; Zinoviev concluded that Putin's historical role was to legitimize the consequences of the Yeltsin coup. In 2006, shortly before his death, he stated that Russia as a sovereign state and a single whole no longer exists, the country presents an imitation (\\"apparent\\"), an artificial, fragile formation connected by the fuel and energy complex: \\"Russia as a powerful energy power is an ideological myth of the Russian unpromising. The very narrowing of economic progress to the \\"pipe\\" is an indicator of historical doom\\". Upon his return, he continued active writing and public work: he edited the editions of his books, commented on political events, spoke at round tables and conferences, gave interviews in various publications, from Zavtra to Komsomolskaya Pravda.In all, Zinoviev gave more than a thousand interviews in his life. In 2000, the publishing house \\"Centrpoligraf\\" published 5 volumes of collected works; director Viktor Vasilyev made the documentary film \\"I am a sovereign state\\", which was not released on the screens. In 2002, to the anniversary of Zinoviev, under the auspices of the Faculty of Philosophy of Moscow State University, the anthology \\"The Phenomenon of Zinoviev\\" was published. His latest novel was the \\"Russian Tragedy\\" (2002). Students began to gather around Zinoviev, and a seminar arose. At the suggestion of the rector of the Moscow University for the Humanities Igor Ilyinsky, the Alexander Zinoviev School was organized, where he taught a course of logical sociology, published on the Internet and published as a guide. The students created the site \\"Zinoviev.ru\\". In recent years, Zinoviev was convinced that he was defending the side of the losers, that Russia was doomed. He never joined any movement, although nationalists tried to draw him into their ranks. He kept radical rhetoric, giving account of the indifference and opportunism of the majority of the population; attached importance to any protest and resistance, speaking, for example, in support of Eduard Limonov. He was carried away by the anti-scientific theory of Anatoly Fomenko, wrote a preface to his book. The New Chronology was consonant with Zinoviev's thoughts about modern falsification of Soviet history, he was impressed by her boldness and originality. According to Maxim Kantor, the peculiar prophetic vanity led Zinoviev to extreme promiscuity. He wanted to be heard, sought to use any tribune and audience, any means and allies, including Fomenko's \\"crazy theory\\". Maxim Kantor describes Zinoviev’s contradictions in this way: Alexander Zinoviev died on May 10, 2006 from a brain tumor. According to Maxim Kantor, in the last conversation he discussed the dehumanization of European culture, arguing that only the revival of humanism could save Russia. According to the testament, he was cremated, the ashes were scattered from a helicopter over the Chukhloma Region, where Zinoviev was born and grew up, a boulder was installed at this place. In memory of the merits before the Russian culture, a symbolic grave-cenotaph was erected at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Posthumously, Zinoviev was awarded the title \\"Honorary Citizen of the Kostroma Region\\". In 2009, a monument to Zinoviev was erected in Kostroma, on the territory of Nikolai Nekrasov Kostroma State University (sculptor Andrey Kovalchuk). In 2016, on the eve of the 95th anniversary of Zinoviev, a new species of butterflies was named in his honor – \\"Zinoviev's Fan Wing\\" (Alucita zinovievi). Grave-cenotaph of Zinoviev at Novodevichy Cemetery of Moscow ==Philosophical thought== The Newest Philosophical Dictionary identifies three periods in the work of Zinoviev.Babaytsev. Alexander Zinoviev // Newest Philosophical Dictionary: 3rd edition, revised: Book House. 2003 – 1280 pages – (World of Encyclopedias). . The first, \\"academic\\", period (1957–1977) – from the first publications of scientific works to the publication of \\"Yawning Heights\\" and expulsion from the Soviet Union: works on the logic and methodology of science. The second period (1978–1985) was the study, description and criticism of \\"real communism\\" in various genres: journalism, social satire and sociological essay. The third period, after the beginning of perestroika, was a period of critic of the collapse of the Soviet system and a critic of modern Western society. British scientists Michael Kirkwood noted the first period (1960–1972); the anti-communist period of “sociological novels\\" (1976–1986), the \\"Gorbachev-Yeltsin\\" gradual transition from anti-communism to criticism of the West (1986–1991), the post-Soviet period of analysis of modern Russia, criticism of the West and globalization (1991–2006). ===Logics=== In the 1950s, Zinoviev outlined the general principles of the \\"meaningful logic\\" program. Formally, being within the framework of the Soviet \\"dialectical logic\\", he limited the applicability of the analysis of Marx's \\"Capital\\" to a special kind of objects (historical or social), which are an \\"organic whole\\" with a complex functional structure. In his version, the dialectic turned out to be \\"a method for studying complex systems of empirical relationships\\". Substantive logic claimed the expression of both the linguistic aspect (formal logic) and logical-ontological, as well as procedural; considered thinking as a historical activity; affirmed the status of logic as an empirical science, the material of which are scientific texts, and the subject matter is the techniques of thinking; considered the instrumental function of logic for scientific thinking. In 1959, Zinoviev considered his concept contradictory, making a choice in favor of mathematical logic. In the monograph \\"The Philosophical Problems of Multivalued Logic\\" (1960), Zinoviev reviewed almost all multivalued logical systems, analyzed the place, main results and applicability of multivalued logic in the logic and methodology of science. In subsequent works, he developed his own concept of logic, which he called \\"complex logic\\". The problem of logic, according to Zinoviev, was not in formal mathematical calculus, but in the development of \\"methods of reasoning, proof, methods of scientific knowledge\\". Zinoviev tried, firstly, to overcome the classical and intuitionistic versions of logic and, secondly, to expand the field of logic research based on the methodology of empirical sciences. The subject of logic is language, it does not discover, but invents specific rules of language — logical rules — and introduces them into language practices as artificial means of systematization. This prescriptivist approach is close to the late Wittgenstein. Zinoviev insisted on the universality of logic, claiming the independence of logical rules from the empirical areas of their application. He denied ontological status to such concepts as a point or zero, considering them tools of knowledge; his approach in Western literature was characterized as logical nominalism. Zinoviev's pupil, the German logician Horst Wessel, noted that his logic was based on syntax, not semantics. Zinoviev investigated a number of questions of non-classical logic, from the general theory of signs to a logical analysis of motion, causality, space and time. In \\"The Philosophical Problems of Multivalued Logic\\", multivalued logic was viewed as a generalization, not an abolition of classical two-valued logic, although Zinoviev concluded that the emergence of multivalued logic \\"dealt a blow\\" to the a priori classical logic. Later, Zinoviev developed a general theory of succession (the theory of inference), which was significantly different from classical and intuitionistic mathematical logic. According to Wessel, its originality was the introduction of the two-place predicate \\"from... logically follows...\\" into the formula for logical following, in fact, metatermine. The theory of logical calculus and the remaining sections of logic (the theory of quantifiers and predication, the logic of classes, normative and epistemic logic) were built on the basis of the theory. The work \\"Complex Logic\\" (1970) presented a systematic consideration of the formal apparatus for analyzing concepts, statements and evidence; a strict quantifier theory was formulated in the monograph that corresponded to intuitive assumptions; the properties of quantifiers were investigated. In a more popular form, his concept, including a discussion of the methodology of physics, was presented in the works \\"The Logic of Science\\" and \\"Logical Physics\\". Zinoviev, proceeding from the thesis about the universality of logic, criticized the point of view that a special or quantum logic is necessary for the microworld, different from the methodological formalism of the macroworld. In his opinion, many problems in the philosophy of physics or ontologies were terminological and were not related to physics proper, such as, for example, the problem of the reversibility of time. In Zinoviev’s analysis, many of the statements traditionally understood as physical and empirical hypotheses were considered as implicit consequences of the definitions of terms; at least these statements can be presented without contradiction or empirical refutation. An example is the phrase \\"the physical body cannot be in different places at the same time\\". ===Sociological novels=== The main object in the books of Zinoviev is the Soviet world as a historical phenomenon, the phenomenon of Sovietness, described through the forbidden topics in the Soviet Union, primarily the taboo problem of social inequality. Zinoviev touched on topics such as drinking, sex, the lives of people with disabilities; ideological language of the Soviet people; degerized history of the Soviet Union in terms of the experience of the inhabitant. Zinoviev's books showed the absurdity of the world of \\"real socialism\\", described the state of minds of the Soviet intelligentsia of the late \\"stagnation\\" period: the characters constantly theorize, compare Soviet ideological myths and reality, try to get to the bottom of it and understand the nature of Soviet society. The characters criticize government policy and ridicule Soviet leaders, discuss economic problems, sympathize with dissidents and anti-Soviet terrorists, are interested in samizdat and Western radio stations, and have some sort of relationship with the State Security Committee. Prisons, camps and repression are placed on the periphery of social life. In contrast to the anti-Soviet dissident literature exposing the actions of individuals (Lenin, Stalin, etc.) or the \\"Party\\" or \\"bureaucracy\\" based on the dichotomy of \\"Power\\" and \\"People\\", Zinoviev describes society at the level of microsociology, his works echo with the \\"ironic sociological treatise\\" – the laws of Parkinson and Murphy. There is a point of view that Zinoviev created a special genre: a \\"sociological novel\\". His books combined science and literature: methods, concepts, scientific statements were artistic techniques, and literary images were used as scientific tools. Different characters expressed the author's ideas, which allowed to consider society from different points of view and to reveal its complexity and paradox. Zinoviev called his work \\"synthetic literature\\" and \\"symphony\\". Zinoviev's genre was understood as a menippea in the terms of Mikhail Bakhtin (Peter Weil and Alexander Genis), a sociological treatise, even a textbook, an analog of the medieval \\"Sum of Knowledge\\" (Maxim Kantor), a parody of a scientific treatise (Dmitry Bykov). As Pavel Fokin believes, a sociological novel is closer to literature than to science, because it uses imagery. Michael Kirkwood considers Zinoviev's creativity to the literary criticism of the \\"letter\\" fashionable in the 1970s (Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes), as a never-ending process produced, according to Bart, as a \\"scriptor\\" and not \\"the author\\". Zinoviev's books were not limited to the conventional paradigm, but covered a wide range of literary, historical, political, sociological, aesthetic, moral, and religious issues. Zinoviev's numerous works represent a holistic artistic universe with their own laws, ideology and poetics, form one gigantic text or collection of texts with a single atomic structure that has no beginning and no end and repeats ad infinitum, therefore it can be read from any place. This structure corresponds to the author's vision of social reality. The idea of a complex, diverse and changeable social world, but subordinate to objective laws, is embodied in the compositional structure, the \\"sociological triangle\\" of three elements: personality, institution, city. The tops of the triangle infinitely forked, united, intersect, revealing all sorts of social relations. Fragments (paragraphs or phrases) contain a complete statement that abstracts part of the social world. Texts, as a rule, consist of dialogues and reflections of representatives of different professions and social strata, cases of life, anecdotes, poems, etc. are often cited. The place of composition and plot is occupied by a kaleidoscope of various situations in which good and evil, sublime and low, heroism and meanness are indistinguishable. There are no descriptions of nature, setting, the story is centered around human relationships and actions. Anthropomorphic characters are used to describe social types, functions, or behaviors; social objects, connections and structures. The characters are missing characters and looks, names and surnames are replaced by nicknames denoting social roles (Thinker, Sociologist, Chatterbox, Slanderer, Screamer, Pretender, Brother, Zaiban, etc.). A frequent \\"character\\" is a theoretical text, usually in the form of a manuscript, discussed by the characters. The texts of Zinoviev, on the one hand, are characterized by brevity, clarity, logic, completeness, humor, limited lexical means, the presence of headings and, on the other hand, represent a rather difficult and boring reading. Zinoviev did not attach much importance to artistic sophistication, his main books, especially \\"Yawning Heights\\" (in the words of Peter Weil and Alexander Genis, \\"an amorphous pile of pages\\"), were intended for Soviet readers and inevitably lost some of their meaning in the translation. The fragmentary manner of writing, breaking the narration into laconic phrases and short paragraphs bring Zinoviev closer to Vasily Rozanov, however Zinoviev's language is much more artless, he is deprived of Swift or Saltykov-Shchedrin's sophistication. Zinoviev exposed and deconstructed the official language of Soviet slogans, a literate and normatively unified language, but filled with ideologemes and abstractions, creating illusory equality that deprived the individual of his freedom of choice. Its deconstruction is a prerequisite for recreating a genuine human language (Claude Schwab). The protest \\"anti-language\\" of Zinoviev resembles the folk Russian folklore, reflects the language of various social groups, primarily the intelligentsia, as well as the military, students, members of the party, members of informal communities. Zinoviev used pleonasms, puns, slang and obscene vocabulary, introduced neologisms: scientific words, portmanteau words, abbreviations. Maxim Kantor believes that the basis of Zinoviev's style was the language of folk tales, an unusual mixture of Mikhail Zoshchenko and Alexander Herzen. The rage of the Zinoviev language is aimed at a breakthrough to truth through lies and the hypocrisy of the established rules, by analogy with the miracle of \\"getting rid of the trouble\\" in a folk tale. \\"Yawning Heights\\" show the city of Ibansk, \\"no one populated area\\", where the successful construction of \\"socism\\" is going on; all inhabitants wear the last name Ibanov. The city is dominated by absurdity, hypocrisy, cruelty, imperious arbitrariness, a sense of a dead end and hopelessness. In the endless Socratic dialogues, the heroes monotonously mock Soviet society and compose various sociological theories that lead nowhere. Most of the characters represent the intelligentsia of \\"liberal\\" views, they are not dissidents, but not capable of resisting conformists. Many pages expose Soviet official rhetoric, but hardly any authority or repressive organs are described. According to one of the points of view, \\"Yawning Heights\\" show science and scientific activity, which has turned into imitation, appearance, hypocrisy and tautology. Science is no longer capable of learning, but only describes itself. Scientists pretend to think, but do not produce anything, people depict the process of work, dissidents imitate resistance. The intelligentsia serves the regime or depicts a protest (\\"theater at Ibank\\"). \\"A Bright Future\\" describes the poverty, lies and spiritual emptiness of Soviet life on the example of the moral degradation of the sixties intellectual, a mediocre person who started his career in Stalin's time and achieved success during the \\"thaw\\". The novel \\"On the Eve of Paradise\\" is dedicated to various manifestations of dissidence generated by Soviet society and being part of it. \\"The Yellow House\\" continues the satire on the \\"progressive Soviet intelligentsia\\", exposes its duplicity, combining conformism with an orientation to the West; unwillingness to associate themselves with the people while preserving their instincts; meaningless parasitism on the texts of \\"bourgeois science\\". The main character, junior researcher, tries to preserve the individuality in the team, but becomes a renegade. As Claude Schwab summed up, the intelligentsia betrayed true spirituality: in scientific institutions they are not looking for truth, a lie is no longer even a lie, but a \\"pseudo- liqueur\\". Konstantin Krylov gives a characteristic quotation from Zinoviev's autobiography: \\"Homo Sovieticus\\" and \\"Para Bellum\\" affected the fate of the Soviet people in the West. \\"Homo Sovieticus\\" ridiculed intrigue, jealousy, the desire for power among immigrants who preserved Soviet habits of adaptation: Komsomol members quickly turn into supporters of Orthodoxy. In the novel, a Soviet person is defined – \\"Homo Sovieticus\\" or \\"Homosos\\": \\"Homosos is accustomed to live in relatively poor conditions, is ready to meet difficulties, constantly expects even worse, is conquered by the orders of the authorities... Homosos is a product of adaptation to certain social conditions\\". ===Sociology=== Zinoviev developed a theory of society based on his own research in the field of logic and the methodology of science, later calling his theory \\"logical sociology\\". Zinoviev often argued that logic interested him as a tool for studying society. Zinoviev's sociological theory can be divided into general and particular. The first relates to the whole world, the second to Soviet communism. The main method of knowledge of society is observation. From a methodological point of view, logical sociology as a rigorous scientific theory was based on two rules: first, the refusal to consider any propositions as a priori true; secondly, the need for a precise definition of the meaning of any term, which would eliminate ambiguity and vagueness. From the second rule, emphasized Zinoviev, followed the importance of constructing a consistent language, free from ideological borrowings. In the explication of terms from the set of objects, those that interest the researcher are highlighted, and a new understanding of the object is introduced; although traditional names can be used (society, government, state, etc.). A classic example is the term \\"communism\\", which Zinoviev used exclusively to describe the Soviet social system. The key philosophical device (or method) of Zinoviev was a detailed logical analysis of the specific content extracted from the original abstract premise. Abstractions, such as communism or democracy, are not a generalized representation, but an incomplete, one-sided knowledge of the subject. Incomplete knowledge, as a rule, ideological, arises through the chaotic assimilation of ideas or images in which a person takes the connection between himself and the object (his own sensations or experiences) as properties of an object. The Zinoviev method allowed to deconstruct practically any general statements and was used in them primarily for the destruction of ideology, initially in the analysis of Soviet society, then the post-Soviet and Western ones. The subject of social cognition is people as social individuals and their associations – \\"cheloveynik\\" (humant hill). According to Zinoviev, any large masses of people function in accordance with natural laws – \\"the laws of sociality\\" (social laws). These laws of existential egoism force the individual to act in order to preserve his social position, strengthen it as much as possible and take a higher position, having received maximum benefits with minimal costs. In accordance with social laws, any social association is divided into managers and subordinates, and social benefits are distributed according to the place of the subject in the power hierarchy. In contrast to the laws of biological individualism, the laws of sociality operate with greater sophistication and irreversibility, since people are able to learn the world and rationally organize their activities: existential laws turn into laws of rational calculation. Morality or law arise as constraints of social laws. In the anthropology of Zinoviev, man is a \\"social animal\\", the mind is secondary to the social. Zinoviev considered the question of the primacy of society or the individual to be naive and outdated; in the modern world, man is a derivative of the social position, a set of social functions. Man is not necessarily evil by nature, but is associated with evil, he has both social and antisocial traits. This dialectic gives rise to the need for a power hierarchy, for domination and submission, in relations of domination and humiliation. A society without hierarchy and power is impossible. With the hypothetical disappearance of the state, many people would lose their main need – to enjoy the pleasure of causing violence to others – and would again build a system of power: society is a machine for maximizing dominance. Zinoviev adhered to the essence of the traditional model of power as a necessary evil, but, noted Konstantin Krylov, in an extremely original way reduced two elements of this definition, emphasizing their difference. Power arises from people's need for unity and generates social self-organization, which it subsequently appropriates. The government does not order anything and controls nothing, but, on the contrary, order arises as its restriction. Power is not effective, avoids responsibility, seeks to violence and destruction, to cause harm to the lower ones. ====Communality and communism==== In the early books, \\"The Yawning Heights\\" and \\"Communism as Reality\\", Zinoviev analyzed the Soviet social order, real communism; no other communism is possible. The main feature of the communist society was that social laws became specific patterns of its life activity. Zinoviev called them \\"communal relations\\" or \\"communality\\". The sphere of communality represents the social in its pure, refined form, in which social actions are aimed not at maximizing domination, but at minimizing humiliation: Communism was regarded by Zinoviev as a stable and durable creation. In \\"Communism as a Reality\\", the history movement was defined as a struggle between communism (communality) and civilization, which in the \\"Bright Future\\" was associated with the principle of individual resistance. According to Konstantin Krylov, the early Zinoviev saw two possible regulators limiting the \\"element of communality\\" – economy (economic competition) and spirituality. In real communism, both restrictions were lifted, and the natural tendency toward selfish behavior inherent in all societies and, ultimately, human nature, was realized. The Soviet social system did not flow out of national peculiarities and was not imposed from above, but, on the contrary, was an example of democracy by the people, assumed the complicity of the governed: \\"The Ibanian system of power is a product of the goodwill of the population\\" (\\"Yawning Heights\\"). Homo Sovieticus is \\"man as it is\\". The naturalness or normality of communal relations is similar to the classical social thought – the ideas of Machiavelli, Bernard de Mandeville, Thomas Hobbes. If, for Hobbes or Hegel, the civil state (society) is limited by the natural state, the situation \\"man is wolf to man\\", then for Zinoviev the essence of the social is the triumph of communality, the principle \\"man is rat to man\\". \\"Communal rattle\\" is a jungle, a nightmare, evil. French commentator Vladimir Berelovich noted that this world is an exemplary anti-utopia, in which utopian paradise embodied in hell. The society is not separated from the natural state and is, in comparison with Orwell or Yevgeny Zamyatin's dystopias, more \\"mundane\\", resembling communities of animals or even insects. As Konstantin Krylov writes, Zinoviev, unlike many, allowed the theoretical possibility of building a society of material abundance, where human labor would be abolished. The answer to the question of what \\"real communism\\" would be was the story in \\"Yawning Heights\\" about rats who were given ideal conditions of existence. Rats, according to Zinoviev, would have created a concentration camp. Communist society consists of basic elements – social \\"cells\\", their structure is the basis of society. As a primary work team of two or more people (for example, a school, hospital, factory, etc.). The cell, firstly, is related to the outside world as a whole; secondly, in it there is a division into a controlling organ (\\"brain\\") and controlled individuals (\\"body\\"); thirdly, managed individuals have different functions. Communal relations dominate inside the primary cell: in the informal life of the collective, there is a cynical struggle for recognition, and not for the improvement of social status, but in accordance with the basic principle: \\"be like everyone else!\\". Communal behavior in nature is hypocritical: lack of talent is exposed by talent, meanness by virtue, cowardly denunciation by courage and honesty, slander by truth. The suppression of the individual is not carried out by the authorities or the Committee for State Security, but in everyday life. The domination of communality brings to the top of the social hierarchy of mediocrity and mediocrity (\\"false idols\\"), clinging to power and feeling natural in it (for example, Stalin), really talented people experience collective envy and hatred. Being a talented careerist means being exceptional mediocrity. Periodic ritual exile and punishment of external enemies (\\"renegades\\") in the course of mass harassment demonstrate the cohesion of social cells and reproduce the mechanisms of subordination, these collective actions relieve the psychological burden of individual responsibility. As Oleg Kharkhordin noted, tight control by higher authorities, as well as total transparency of the collective's internal life, mutual control and violence protect cells from degenerating into a mafia or gang, which would have happened if they were given freedom of self-organization. Zinoviev considers the communist power in two planes: horizontal (social relations in the cellular structure) and vertical (hierarchy), the second is layered on the first. Power is reproduced \\"from below\\", at the level of the primary collective, where representation and democracy is exercised: people voluntarily join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, members of the party are elected, they want to participate in power, the lower levels of the party influence the party top line. Despotic and informal power in social relations is literally everywhere.According to Vladimir Berelovich, Zinoviev's approach is close to the Fucian model of the all-pervading power. The cell structure leaves no room for law and politics: there are no parties or political competition, as well as political power. As Vladimir Berelovich wrote, Zinoviev consistently reduces the political to power, the power to the state apparatus, the apparatus to society. The state is not a political institution, but diluted socially, its only function is the reproduction of social relations. Since there are no social classes or interest groups in real communism, the ruling caste is not a social stratum or institution. The communist leadership is a \\"specific group\\" of several individuals. At the macro level, power turns into a dictatorship, but the supreme power is helpless in wanting to control everything. Zinoviev's views on the history of real communism, Stalinism and the figure of Stalin are set forth in the novel \\"The Wings of Our Youth\\", other works and speeches. The events of 1917 were more like the collapse of the Russian Empire than a revolution, and, like the Civil War, were only a \\"foam of history\\". The deep-seated processes Zinoviev considered the emergence and maturation of a new society: institutional and bureaucratic changes, the growth and complication of the system of power, the formation of social cells, etc. The appearance of the figure of Stalin was inevitable and necessary. Stalin's leaderism had a national basis, Stalinism was a form of democracy: people of power (nominees) occupied power positions, people exercised power directly, using denunciations. The ruin of the village during the collectivization produced a social upheaval, millions of people from the lower classes gained access to education and culture. Repression resulted from the activities of the masses: the horror of Stalinism was not in the victims, but in the fact that the executioners, beginning with Stalin, best fit the social environment. Stalinism showed \\"the terrible essence of the centuries-old dream of mankind\\". The Stalin era was the era of the formation of real communism; Stalinism ended when a strong bureaucracy was formed. Khrushchev time was a period of unrest, under Brezhnev, communism reached a state of maturity. ====Cheloveynik, Westernism and Super-Society==== In the 1990s, Zinoviev turned to the study of Western society – \\"Westernism\\" and the modern tendencies of the social evolution of mankind. A systematic exposition of sociological theory is presented in the monographs \\"Towards a Super- Society\\" and “Logical Sociology”. In the controversy with the Marxist and post-industrial approaches, Zinoviev, proceeding from the principle of anti- historicism, did not consider human associations in terms of their progressiveness – the level of development of science, technology, economics, etc., but depending on the type of social organization and their adequacy to the \\"human material\\". Human material is a combination of the character traits of a people, unevenly distributed among its individual representatives; type of social organization and specific human material are closely related. To characterize complex human associations, Zinoviev introduced the notion of a cheloveynik (humant hill), clearly referring to an anthill. Zinoviev emphasized the role of biological evolution in the emergence of human associations and showed the direction of social evolution towards the maximum separation of functions, by analogy with collective insects. Cheloveyniks differ from animal communities only in the density of connections: there are many people, and they have to enter into close relationships. Cheloveyniks have a common historical life for generations; act as one; have a complex and functional device; own a certain territory; have internal autonomy, internal and external identification. The evolution of the cheloveynik includes three stages: pre-society – primitive or generic societies; society – the union of people, historically formed as a whole; global super-society consisting of heterogeneous human material. Cheloveyniks differ in the type of social time, which is capable of expansion, compression, can go backwards; in other words, they can be owned. The pre-society lives in an eternal social present, society is able to own the past, and the super-society controls its future, a narrow group of people will be engaged in this design. At the stage of society, separate areas of life activity arise, three aspects of the relationship between social individuals. The business aspect refers to the activities of people in the production of livelihoods, the creation of material culture. The communal aspect affects any actions related to the presence of large masses of people, and affects the relationship of power and position in the social hierarchy. The mental aspect includes the sphere of consciousness or mentality and is considered from the point of view of its influence on values and behavior, beyond the criteria of truth and falsity. In the late Zinoviev, the economic sphere and mentality were no longer limiters of communality. In various societies, one or another aspect prevails, which leads to their features and patterns of development. Capitalist societies have grown out of the business aspect as economic societies. Soviet society arose on the basis of communal relations and became a communist society. In the twentieth century, the historical epoch of the existence of separate societies as national states ends, after the Second World War, with the complication of social organization, the transition to super-society takes place. Within the framework of Western European civilization, which possessed a unique ability to qualitatively change itself, two evolutionary branches emerged that fought for the role of leaders of the world evolutionary process: cheloveyniks of the communist type (Soviet Union) and westernist cheloveyniks (United States and Western Europe). Westernism, inhabited by \\"westernoids\\", is a unique form of social organization that originated in Europe and spread to North America, part of Asia and Australia. Capitalism and democracy are natural and effective only for westernoids as a specific human material, for other peoples they are destructive. The primary social cells (\\"business cells\\") of the West are totalitarian, based on rigid discipline. Westernism is evolving from democracy and capitalism (historically finite phenomena) towards communism and communality, \\"post-democracy\\". The West seeks global hegemony, globalization, Westernization and Americanization are one and the same: a new form of Western colonialism. Forms of social organization, government and mentality are imposed on non-Western societies, in particular, through illusory ideas about the possibilities of having Western abundance. Westernization is not the malice of the ruling circles, but follows from objective social laws. According to the British commentator Philip Hanson, the assessment of the geographical distribution of Westernism has a clear resemblance to the work of the English economist Angus Maddison; the criticism of globalization and the American imperial project echoes the views of Noam Chomsky and Niall Ferguson and the moderate positions of Eric Hobsbawm. The Soviet Union was historically the first super-society, but as a result of the victory of the West in the Cold War and the defeat of communism, the second line of evolution prevailed. The domination of a super-society, a single, global cheloveynik was established as the domination of Westernism: other peoples and states are doomed to remain subordinate to the West on the periphery. The illegitimate and non-electoral superpower is being built over previously existing areas, creating a super-state and super-economy. Hierarchical power networks of the superstate are engaged in strategic management, controlling finances, media, parties, etc.; in money totalitarianism of the super-economy, money turns from capital into a means of power. In early history, there were many pre- societies, in the recent past – fewer societies; after the defeat of Soviet communism, the world forever became one (although the distant future remains uncertain). Autonomous evolution of cheloveyniks is no longer possible, the global super-society eliminates or absorbs them. Civilization of Western Europe will eventually disappear too. ====Death of communism and post- Sovietism==== In the 1990s, Zinoviev shifted research accents and changed assessments regarding Soviet communism, which, commentators noted, was not a radical change of opinion: he had previously written about the merits of the Soviet system and never rejected communism, considering it a working system. Zinoviev softened his attitude towards Soviet society and adjusted the estimates of the future. Communism was a young and viable social system, effective in a social sense, and not economically. It arranged for most ordinary people who earned little, but also worked a little. Communism allowed to meet basic needs, eliminated unemployment and, at least in the early period, was directed to the future. The collapse of Soviet communism was considered a tragedy by Zinoviev. Initially, he believed that restructuring was the wrong answer to the managerial crisis that began as an ideological one. The crisis could have been resolved by Soviet methods, but the leaders of the Soviet Union took it for the crisis of the Soviet system. Therefore, the Restructuring inevitably had to lead to its death. Later, he believed that the main reasons for the collapse of communism were not internal contradictions, but the intervention of Western forces with the help of traitors and collaborators of the fifth column, primarily the Soviet and Russian authorities. Communism was finally destroyed between 1991 and 1993. The West may use some of the merits of communism, but, according to Zinoviev, the fate of the vanquished is obvious: after winning the Cold War, the West will not only destroy Russia, but also erase its memory from history (\\"The Global Humant Hill\\"). The collapse of communism was dangerous for two reasons: first, the communist system was most suitable for Russia due to the peculiarities of the Russian human material; secondly, the defeat of communism cut off the evolutionary branch opposed to Westernism: from now on, humanity will have no alternative organized into a rigid hierarchical structure. At the same time, Abdusalam Huseynov noted, for Zinoviev, the victory of communism in the Cold War and its worldwide expansion would lead to a much worse scenario. The system of post-Soviet Russia Zinoviev considered as a secondary social creation. If Soviet communism was a normal (full-fledged) type of social organization, then \\"post-Sovietism\\" – \\"horned rabbit\\" – was a particularly \\"vile\\" and \\"disgusting\\" type of social hybrid from the worst features of Soviet communism, Westernism and fundamentalism in pre-revolutionary Russia. Zinoviev did not consider the reforms of the 1990s the building of a market economy or Western democracy. Reforms, on the contrary, collapsed the economy, destroying the basis of everyday life – labor collectives; there was only the conversion of informal asset management into formal property. The western component of post-Sovietism is incompatible with human material, natural conditions and historical traditions of Russia; Western democracy is imitated, but not implemented. The economy has lost sovereignty, because the West is interested in the destruction of Russia. Post-Sovietism has no vision of the future – even the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has abandoned communist ideas, and Orthodox fundamentalism has taken the place of ideology. ===Ideology and history. \\"Understanding Factor\\"=== Zinoviev considered ideology to be a \\"virus\\" dangerous for society. Ideology forms a person's world outlook about himself, about the conditions of his existence, about society and the outside world. It determines various social roles or masks, makes a person play a social game, depriving him of critical thinking; ideology serves power. Ideology is the antithesis of logical and scientific thinking, but humanity cannot do without ideology, it is an irremovable element of large human associations. Soviet society Zinoviev considered the first fully subordinate ideology. It was contained not only in the official doctrine, but primarily in daily activities, turning people into active, active participants in ideological performances (Michael Kirkwood). Belief in ideology is not required, it is accepted on the basis of rational calculation (Claude Schwab). Ideology reduces a person to a function, social morality turns into a pseudo-moral or false moral, in a completely conformist communist society there is no trust. In Yawning Heights, most of society is made up of hypocrites, cynics, and lackeys, out of which emerges a \\"new person\\" constructed by ideology, a \\"normal individual\\", deprived of all human (conscience, individuality, etc.). The ideological consciousness of man is for Zinoviev beyond the bounds of an unreliable historical experience, since \\"there are only illusions of historical explanation\\" (\\"Communism as a Reality\\"). Hence the extra-historical approach and the lack of chronology in his works. As Maxim Kantor writes, all events, \\"both Marx, and Ibansk, and \\"catastroika\\", and utopia, and the Master (Stalin), and Westernism\\", occur simultaneously in the consciousness of the individual. For Zinoviev, history is a history of disintegration, both personal and social, the history of dehumanization in the name of progress. Ibansk – a completely dehumanized society, in which there is no linear time; \\"the story ran aground\\", turned into an absurdity. People are sentenced to the eternal present, waiting for the end, without hope, for hope refers to an open story. The characters of \\"Yawning Heights\\" do not even try to leave a mark on history, because they realize that the past can always be rewritten. For early Zinoviev, sociology prevailed over history, he explored communism as a given, considering capitalism and communism in sync, as different structural variants of the existence of society. Later, Zinoviev expanded his concept to the West: Communism and Westernism represent the varieties of the mass society of the 20th century, marking the end of human history. The personality of a person is completely dependent on social position and ideology. The world is moving towards simplification; Evgeny Ponomarev believes that Zinoviev comes close to his views on the history of Konstantin Leontyev. The next stage of personal degradation is the emergence of a computer, which takes away from a person his functions and suppresses an excess of information. Civilization turns into imitation – one big computer, endlessly processing the same data. The future society of a \\"global cheloveynik\\" is reminiscent of Soviet communism: a person is impersonal, turns into a function, a half-robot, human relations are replaced by virtual ones in conditions of total distortion of information and the domination of ideology. True responsibility of a person towards himself, the world and other people is possible only with the liberation of consciousness from any form of ideology, which is not easy to do: people are afraid and avoid the truth, do not want to know the truth about themselves (\\"Yawning Heights\\"). As Maxim Kantor believes, the thinker defended an absolute understanding of human existence, \\"understood to understand\\" (the position of the Hegelian). Zinoviev believed in the power of reason, as well as in the power of man, in the fact that the scientific understanding of society can change it. A person must constantly think, see the real state of things, not be satisfied with illusions, understand why he acts in society in a certain way. In the later period, Zinoviev considered the main problem of our time is the unwillingness and inability of people to understand society, its changes and their own place in social evolution. For objective understanding, extra-scientific conditions are also necessary: on the one hand, a certain ethical position is the rejection of dominant values, attitudes and social rules; on the other hand, the value aspect is the formation of a social ideal. In recent works, Zinoviev considered the communist utopia to be such an ideal. Michael Kirkwood quoted Zinoviev as saying, believing that it explains the inconsistency of his thought: ===Ethics=== Zinoviev's ethics was a response to the social laws of existential egoism, in which there is neither morality nor freedom. Ethics complements the pessimistic sociology, which, by its own admission, Zinoviev developed to create a \\"teaching about life\\" and find a place in society for himself as an \\"ideal communist\\". In \\"Yawning Heights\\", Zinoviev wrote: \\"The point is not to discover the truth about yourself. There is no need for a lot of mind. The point is how to live after that\\". The machinery of society is subject to cruel and inhuman laws, inevitable, like the laws of nature; but a separate individual can overcome them, build his life as a \\"paradise\\" in a social \\"hell\\". Zinoviev often quoted phrase: \\"When people want to spit on the laws of gravity, they build airplanes\\". The quintessence of Zinoviev's ethics is contained in the phrase: \\"I am a sovereign state\\"; he argued that he adhered to this principle all his life, even making his own constitution. As Abdusalam Huseynov noted, Zinoviev developed an ethical teaching exclusively for himself. The system of Zinoviev's views, which he called the \\"Zinovyoga\\", echoes the tradition that goes from the Stoics to Kant. General provisions were developed in the early 1960s and set forth, in particular, in the \\"Gospel for Ivan\\", \\"Go to Golgotha\\" and \\"Live\\". Zinoviev's ethics has the following features: simplicity and unconditionality (Kant and Albert Schweitzer), despite the fragility, weakness and complexity of its implementation; Responsibility (Antoine de Saint-Exupéry), ethics are based on responsible individual judgment. A person faces a choice: to participate in the egoistic struggle for social benefits or to evade it, but remain in society. Personal decision in specific situations voluntarily limits the laws of sociality and, therefore, is truly moral or ethical. Should a man be conformist? Should he risk going against the tide? If so, in the name of what? What will happen to him if he violates social laws? An ethical act in itself is not moral or immoral, it is necessary to be guided by its own values and values, and not by general ideas. Man is the criterion for the determination of good and evil, which does not mean the absence of commandments or models. On the contrary, there are many different rules and regulations, following which a person from a social individual becomes a person, using the ethical experience of humanity. The main rule – the rejection of actions aimed at own benefit, if it harms another. Ethics of resistance is based on paradox: Zinoviev as the scientist proceeded from the inexorable course of social evolution and social determinism, but he believed that in the struggle for freedom, a person must act, fight, resist, so that there is hope, although it does not exist. The worse the situation, the more reasons for resistance, and the struggle is possible only in solitude, which, like death, is the price for a truly ethical act. Through loneliness, a person enters an invisible community of those who have chosen resistance into the \\"eternal fraternity of the lonely\\" (the fate of the Talker in \\"Yawning Heights\\"). ==Heritage. Perception. Criticism== ===Logical heritage=== Zinoviev played an important role in the development of national logic in the 1950–1960s. His early program of \\"substantive logic\\" did not receive official recognition, but influenced the development of Soviet research on the methodology of science. In the 1960s, Zinoviev was one of the leading Soviet logicians, the leader of the \\"cognitive movement\\", which, according to Vladislav Lektorsky, fascinated many philosophers, logicians, mathematicians, psychologists and linguists. Five works by Zinoviev were published in the West, which was a unique case for Russian philosophical thought. The monograph \\"The Philosophical Problems of Multivalued Logic\\" (1960), soon translated into English, was a significant event in Soviet philosophy, although it had flaws. Classical work became one of the world's first monographs on multi-valued logic and the first in the Soviet bloc. In general, the work of Zinoviev corresponded to the level of scientific achievements in the field of non-classical logic of the time, highly valued by such logicians as Kazimir Aydukevich, Jozef Bohensky, Georg von Wright, but did not attract much attention in the West. Zinoviev gave priority to formal methods over formal calculi, which alienated his work from the main directions and trends of the logic and methodology of science of the second half of the 20th century. Negatively, the fate of the logical heritage of Zinoviev was influenced by extra-scientific reasons: the collapse of his school after forced emigration, the ban in the Soviet Union of references to his work. As a result, in the domestic literature there is no systematic presentation of the corpus of logical works of the scientist. ===Perception in the West=== Zinoviev gained fame primarily as the author of \\"Yawning Heights\\", a dissident writer, becoming probably the most famous representative of the third wave emigration after Alexander Solzhenitsyn. His \\"sociological novels\\" were generally popular, attracted the attention of critics and the press, were translated into various languages. According to Pavel Fokin, a critical bibliography of Zinoviev in Europe contains several hundred articles and reviews, a number of monographs. The experimental novelty of his poetics was quite understandable to the Western reader, taking into account the development of literature in the 20th century. His prose was highly praised, for example, by Anthony Burgess and Eugène Ionesco, who considered Zinoviev to be perhaps the largest contemporary writer. Subsequent works were perceived as weaker compared to the \\"infinite rage\\" of the \\"Yawning Heights\\" or the \\"directness\\" of the \\"Bright Future\\". Emigrant criticism, positively assessing the first two books, later ignored his works, not least because of the satire on dissidents. Zinoviev gained the greatest popularity in France, where the \\"Yawning Heights\\" temporarily destroyed the image of the Soviet Union, created by Solzhenitsyn's book \\"The Gulag Archipelago\\". In contrast to the generally accepted Western ideas about the \\"evil empire\\", shared by Solzhenitsyn and the third wave of immigrants, Zinoviev gave the Soviet system a kind of existential value. In the émigré environment, the opinion that the understanding of the Soviet Union by Zinoviev should be taken seriously was quite common. Estimates of Zinoviev as sociologist in the West are ambiguous. His works were considered as the first attempt of the Soviet philosopher to propose a critique of Soviet institutions independent of official dogma and a holistic concept of the Soviet system, presented in its original form. In the 1980s, his books attracted the attention of a number of historians and social scientists, changing their perception of Soviet society, and \\"lured\\" some Slavists. Sovietologists perceived \\"Communism as a Reality\\" with respect, but criticized some of the key statements. Outside of Sovietology, the ideas of Zinoviev influenced the political researchers of Ronald of Tyr, and especially of Jon Elster, who believed that the Ibanian model of \\"ineffectiveness\\" allows one to comprehend political irrationality. Interest in Zinoviev expressed in the collective collection \\"Alexander Zinoviev: a Writer and Thinker\\" (1988). In 1992, Michael Kirkwood's monograph \\"Alexander Zinoviev: An Introduction to His Work\\" was published. In general, the impact of Zinoviev on Sovietology was insignificant. The Western establishment was indifferent to Zinoviev, his works were considered as a subject of study, and not as part of intellectual dialogue. According to Konstantin Krylov, numerous European awards and titles of \\"honorary citizen of Orange and Ravenna\\" represented rather \\"tinsel\\". Outside of France and Italy, especially in English-speaking countries, the perception of Zinoviev's ideas as a social theorist was much cooler.Among the exceptions – Leszek Kolakovsky. Commentators Philip Hanson and Michael Kirkwood noted that the format of the interview, in which Zinoviev usually spoke, simplified and exaggerated his ideas, exacerbating the negative attitude in the English-speaking world. Zinoviev's harsh public statements even before perestroika contributed to his \\"semi-quarantine\\" in the academic environment. Oleg Kharkhordin summarized the reasons for the non-acceptance of Zinoviev's sociological works in the West: first, his sociological essays did not meet the scientific standards of positivistic research, although Zinoviev insisted on the opposite; secondly, he later accused the West of a conspiracy to destroy the Soviet Union, which was regarded as a gross political blunder. Zinoviev himself argued that Sovietologists were engaged because they pursued not scientific, but political goals: to find weaknesses, weaknesses and vulnerabilities in Communism in order to \\"kill the beast\\". According to Western critics, the claims to create an \\"absolute\\" social science, to a \\"truly scientific\\" description of society, in particular Soviet society, and to discover absolute and mathematically precise social laws have become outdated. Zinoviev was the heir of 19th century scientism and Soviet scientism and was not familiar with the achievements of the classics of Western sociology. The naive desire to learn society as a \\"reality\\" with the help of the method excluding interpretations reflected the influence of Hegel and Marxism (ideas about the real and reasonable identities) and did not withstand the criteria of Kant established for scientific knowledge (distinction between phenomenon and noumenon). As a result, the objective social laws with which Zinoviev replaced the Marxist laws of historical development were placed by him as natural laws into reality, which corresponded to the ideology of Marxism-Leninism. Critics noted the contradiction between the declared scientific impartiality of Zinoviev, his sociological determinism and obvious moralism, belief in free will and ethical imperatives. It was concluded that he was not a scientist, but rather a moralist or a writer. His social determinism and idolatry before sociology excluded the possibility of free action or resistance. Hence the critical attitude of Zinoviev to dissidents, to their position of \\"personal feat\\". Zinoviev was accused of apologizing for Stalin and justifying collectivization under the guise of objectivity. He was blamed for anti–historicism and certain views that included ideas obsolete in social thought: the naturalistic vision of society, similar to the concept of Herbert Spencer; ideas about the inevitable social evolution (Marxism), its passage through certain stages; a mixture of archaic, Marxist and modern political concepts. Vladimir Berelovich concluded that the sociological concept of Zinoviev should be viewed not as a theory of Soviet society, but rather as a manifestation of the \\"mental universe\\" underlying the Soviet regime and its ideology. According to Georges Niva, The \\"scientific forecast\\" of Zinoviev about the stability of Soviet communism as a social system incapable of reform was not justified. From the point of view of Western researchers, he was refuted by historical events: Perestroika, the collapse of the Soviet Union. Claude Lefort in 1989 summarized: According to Philip Hanson, the turn of the late Zinoviev to criticism of the West resembles the evolution of Herzen and Solzhenitsyn, who, like Nikolai Berdyaev, retained a deep affection for Russia. Unlike Berdyaev and Solzhenitsyn, Zinoviev was guided by communism, rationality and society. The thinker evolved from Westernism to Slavophilism (Michael Kirkwood) or to \\"Soviet patriotism\\" (Philip Hanson), social, rather than ethnic nationalism (Zinoviev laughed at particular \\"Russian spirituality\\"). Zinoviev's post-communist opus, Hanson believes, simplifiedly generalized the non-Western world and exaggerated the invulnerability of the West; the commentator doubted that the Soviet Union was a super-society. At the same time, the results of sociological surveys about the attitude of Russians towards the collapse of the Soviet Union and the social changes that have taken place largely confirm his vision. According to Hanson, Zinoviev's large-scale historical scheme clearly expressed and partly anticipated the public mindset in modern Russia, especially the views of the ruling elite of the Putin era: a feeling of humiliation, anti-Americanism and regret about the collapse of the Soviet Union. Although Zinoviev did not have time for the Russian leaders, he thought in a similar way that they too were, but more clearly. ===Perception in Russia=== Alexander Zinoviev belonged to those Soviet philosophers who opposed dogma in science and humanitarian thought in the 1950s and 1960s, their heated debates influenced public attitudes, shaped the views and beliefs of the Soviet intelligentsia. His sociological novels, which were circulated in samizdat during the late \\"stagnation\\" period, contributed to the collapse of official ideology, which had already pretty weakened after strikes by dissidents and Solzhenitsyn. Zinoviev's books were written on the topic of the day, they reflected one or another public mindset, therefore in the 1980s their readers were \\"westerners\\", in the 1990s they were \\"soilers\\". His works began to be published quite late, after the books of Andrei Platonov and Vladimir Nabokov, but before Solzhenitsyn. \\"Yawning Heights\\" sold out in a rather large circulation, \\"Communism as a Reality\\" in 1994 did not arouse much reader interest. The difficulty of Zinoviev's language was not noticed by readers of samizdat; more important was the fact of reading forbidden literature; later complex style contributed to the disappearance of interest. According to Konstantin Krylov, by the 21st century, Zinoviev's anti-Soviet books \\"fell into the same cesspool as all anti-Soviet literature\\", with the active participation of their former readers – representatives of the \\"liberal\\" intelligentsia. In the 1990s, there was almost no discussion of Zinoviev's work in the intellectual environment, which he himself contributed to with his sometimes rash and not always thought-out statements. According to Konstantin Krylov, Russian intellectuals, as a rule, spoke of him with \\"simplicity of fastidiousness\\", considered him to be \\"Ivan who does not know how to flicker foppishly, does not quote Foucault and Marcuse\\" and whose \\"glamorous\\" constructions are not suitable for \\"discourse\\". Representatives of the \\"liberal\\" intelligentsia condemned Zinoviev for his primitive literary form, his betrayal of liberalism, and his fierce defense of communism. At the same time, his conspiracy theories about Western \\"puppeteers\\" were readily accepted by the \\"soilers\\". According to Vladislav Lektersky, the sociological concept of Zinoviev, with rare exceptions, was not comprehended by Russian academic sociology and philosophy, although the image of homo sovieticus was used in sociological research by Yuri Levada and his followers. Later works by Zinoviev influenced, in particular, the sociologist Andrei Fursov and the political philosopher Vadim Tsymbursky. In the 21st century, a certain interest arose in the legacy of Zinoviev. With the efforts of Olga Zinovieva, \\"The Understanding Factor\\" was posthumously published as his final work. The thinker was devoted to the volume from the series \\"Russian Philosophy of the Second Half of the 20th Century\\" (2009), a collection of memoirs \\"Alexander Alexandrovich Zinoviev: the Experience of a Collective Portrait\\" (2012). The first philological candidate dissertation was defended in 2013. In 2016, in the series \\"The Life of Wonderful People\\", a biography of Zinoviev was written by literary historian Pavel Fokin. Zinoviev is considered as an independent Russian thinker, who combined philosophy, logic, sociology, ethics, literature in a holistic worldview. A number of commentators believe that Zinoviev thought not in the form of rigorous systematic knowledge, not with the help of scientific concepts, but through images, metaphors, allegories, deliberately eliminating the separation between philosophy and literature to best describe reality. His works, especially of the late period, are often characterized as philosophical or sociological journalism. The philosopher Vadim Mezhuyev noted the extreme complexity and contradictory views of Zinoviev, the amplitude of his paradoxical thought. Having written, perhaps, \\"the worst satire on the Soviet system\\", he then called the Soviet period the best in the history of Russia, the best that Russia was able to create. The figure of Zinoviev is tragic, he was distinguished by pessimism and, probably, an extremely \\"tragic view of history\\". With good reason, he rejected Western society (\\"Westernism\\"), but he perceived Russia ambiguously, combining love for Russia with a desire to understand it scientifically. However, Zinoviev was not an apologist for real communism and did not at all consider him an ideal. Finally, his vision of the world was deeply personal, created \\"out of himself\\" – many of his books did not contain footnotes. Therefore, Mezhuev concludes, it is difficult for Zinoviev to compare with someone, to understand to whom he inherited, including in Russian thought. According to Maxim Kantor, Zinoviev became a writer \\"out of shame for human nature\\" and created a multi-volume \\"history of the Russian state\\" in the form of a folk epos, covering the period from Khrushchev to Yeltsin; the history of the people's tragedy – dehumanization and degradation of social and human dignity, the history of the collapse and series of disasters, however, told as one endless joke. The chronicle of the era of disintegration was a \\"study of research\\", through double exclusion described the ideological factory of society – philosophers, sociologists, nomenclature. According to Kantor, Zinoviev's fairy-tale epic from book to book became increasingly banal, unfunny, flat and boring: later works on the West did not reach the level of \\"Yawning Heights\\". Bold, but scientifically naive and unreliable books about the West were actually written by the author about Russia; the real West was never of interest to Zinoviev. The image of the West was one of the metaphors of Russian life – Zinoviev followed Russian emigrant thought, starting with Herzen. According to Russian sociologist Nina Naumova, \\"Yawning Heights\\" were the only attempt in Soviet sociology to propose a description of the Soviet system.Interview with Nina Naumova / Russian Sociology of the Sixties in Memoirs and Documents – St. Petersburg: Russian Christian Humanitarian Institute, 1999 – Pages 301–316 Russian-American philosopher and sociologist Oleg Kharkhordin considered \\"Communism as Reality\\" the best introduction to the sociology of Soviet life, noting the exceptional \\"clarity and power\\" of Zinoviev's conceptualization of informal activity. Kharkhordin saw the proximity of his model to the analysis of traditionalist communities by Pierre Bourdieu and found advantages in the Zinoviev model. Andrei Fursov brings Zinoviev's work closer to the \\"new social history\\" that arose in the 1970s based on the ideas of Edward Thompson, Michel Foucault, and others. This direction considers history not from the point of view of elites, but from the side of the oppressed. Therefore, Zinoviev, according to Fursov, was at the forefront of world social thought; \\"Zinoviev's system\\" offers a promising answer to the question of the possibility of social knowledge that overcomes the limited views of the ruling and oppressed groups (ideology and utopia). Abdusalam Huseynov believed that the realized Zinoviev's forecast of \\"Catastroika\\" undoubtedly proves his concept of Soviet communism. Philosopher Boris Mezhuyev drew attention to the fact that Zinoviev, at the end of his anti-communism, criticized Gorbachev from left- wing, radical positions, considering the perestroika a provocation of special services (\\"Gorbachevism\\"). Only in 1989 did Zinoviev take up the position of archiconservatism, subsequently making every effort so that his early views would be forgotten. Mezhuyev did not doubt the sincerity of the convictions of the \\"outstanding thinker\\", but noted that even the \\"best people of Russia\\" manifest radicalism, infantilism, hatred of moderation, nonviolence, harmony and compromise, characteristic of the Russian mentality. According to another point of view (Andrei Fursov), Zinoviev's uncompromising and polemic position was based on \\"truth – the truth of the people, history, generation\\", which in the Russian tradition brought the thinker closer to Avvakum. If Fursov called Zinoviev a \\"great contrarian\\", then Maxim Kantor believed that the thinker was a \\"great affirmator\\" who dreamed of the epic of utopia, overcoming tradition, about a holistic, free from the lie of human being. According to Konstantin Krylov, Zinoviev perceived himself as a lone \\"fighter\\" acting according to the situation and considering his activities to be useful service to the society rejected by him. Zinoviev was characterized by Dmitry Bykov as a person with a \\"clinical complete lack of fear\\", a conflicting egocentric and nonconformist.

The population at the 2011 census was 14,212. Historically part of Lancashire, it lies northwest of Manchester, southwest of Bury and south of Bolton. It is bounded on the west by Walkden, the east by Whitefield, the north by Farnworth and the south by Clifton. Kearsley was a township in the ancient ecclesiastical parish of Deane, in the Hundred of Salford. Kearsley Urban District was a local government authority from 1894 until 1974. In 1933, part of Clifton was added to Kearsley Urban District. Part of Outwood, Radcliffe became part of Kearsley in line with the 1933 Lancashire Review. ==History== textile mill at Stoneclough. Kearsley lay within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire and was industrialised by 1752 when James Brindley solved drainage problems at the Wet Earth Colliery on the borders of Kearsley and Clifton. In 1780, a mill was built at the point where the River Croal meets the River IrwellBolton Organisation In 1830(1830) The New Lancashire Gazetteer or Topographical Dictionary it was described as: \\"Kersley, a township in the parish of Deane, Hundred of Salford, 7 miles N.W. from Manchester. Inhabitants 1,833. In this township is Kearsley Moor, an extensive common, under the surface of which there are many valuable coalmines\\". In the Industrial Revolution a papermill, cotton mills, chemical works, an iron foundry, a quarry and 15 coal mines operated within its boundaries. In the mid-19th century, the area was a busy coal mining area. Several street names such as Moss Colliery Road (in nearby Clifton) bear testimony to this. The largest coal mine was the Unity Brook Colliery. On 12 March 1878 an explosionThis is Lancashire in the mine killed 43 men and boysDurham Mining Museum and 19 of the dead were buried at the parish church.Genuki Kearsley By 1900 the coal mining industry had all but disappeared. In the late 1920s, the coal-fired Kearsley Power Station was built. It used water for cooling from the River Irwell. The power station closed, and was demolished, on 12 May 1985. The power station had a railway connection, which has been removed and is now a pedestrian trail. ==Economy== Today Kearsley has little industry, the one remaining mill is now a multi occupancy building housing retail and light engineering. There are three small industrial estates concerned mainly with the transport industry. They are the Europa Industrial Estate and the Fishbrook Industrial Estate on Stoneclough Road plus the Lion Industrial Estate on Moss Road. There is a small shopping precinct and some isolated shops along Manchester Road (A666). ==Transport== The A666 from Manchester to Bolton passes through Kearsley. Today it lies on the A666 at a point where the Kearsley Roundabout connects it and Farnworth to the M61 motorway via the Kearsley Spur link road. Kearsley railway station is on Stoneclough Road, from where there is a service northbound to Bolton and southbound to Manchester. In 1878, the mineral railway line to Kearsley was opened, at a cost of £100.Bolton Revisited Kearsley is on a bus route from Bolton to Manchester. In earlier days, it was a tram route. On 3 June 1881, trams ran the full length of the system: Town Hall Square, Bolton to Farnworth and Kearsley. The bus routes through Kearsley are the numbers 8 (to Shudehill, Manchester), 2 (to the Trafford Centre), 512/513 (to Bury) and 557 (to Farnworth) The 22 route was a former route from Bolton to Stockport.

The church was founded in 1870, erected in 1870–71 by the family of the Harrison Blair who died before it was finished. It cost £3,600 and has seating for 538 parishioners. The Bishop of Manchester, Dr Fraser consecrated the church on 1 July 1871. A United Reformed church was founded before 1890. It is now closed. The New Jerusalem Church on Bolton Road (founded in 1836) has a disused graveyard. St John Fisher Roman Catholic Church was founded in 1969 on Manchester Road. Kearsley Mount Methodist Church was founded in 1836 and a Wesleyan Sunday School was built overlooking the Irwell Valley opposite the parish church. The first chapel was built in 1870. In 1914 it was demolished due to mining subsidence and the present building was opened in 1916. A Wesleyan day school was built next to the church in 1879 and was extended in 1890. The school was demolished in 2009 and replaced by a block of flats by St Vincent's Housing Association. After two years planning and ten months building, the Schoenstatt Shrine was dedicated on 1 October 2000 by Bishop Terence Brain the Bishop of Salford.

The station has a net electrical output of 1,190 megawatts, which is 2% of Great Britain's peak electricity demand of 60 GW. Electricity is produced through the use of two advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGR). Hartlepool was only the third nuclear power station in the United Kingdom to use AGR technology. It was also the first nuclear power station to be built close to a major urban area. Originally planned in 1967, with construction starting in 1969, the station started generating electricity in 1983, and was completed in 1985, initially being operated by the Central Electricity Generating Board. With privatisation of the UK's electric supply industry in 1990, the station has been owned by Nuclear Electric and British Energy, but is now owned and operated by EDF Energy. On 18 October 2010 the British government announced that Hartlepool was one of the eight sites it considered suitable for future nuclear power stations. ==History== With the economic success of another advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) nuclear power station at Dungeness, the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) proposed their third AGR station in 1967 to be situated on the edge of the Durham coalfield, near the seaside resort of Seaton Carew. The proposal came at a time when the CEGB's move toward alternative fuels to coal, threatened the coal industry's existence. Despite this, and a short ministerial delay, the plans for the Seaton Carew station (which became known as Hartlepool nuclear power station) went ahead. Because the construction of the station was given the go ahead, the National Coal Board were not able to get the CEGB behind the plans for a prototype fluidised bed combustion (FBC) coal station at Grimethorpe in Yorkshire. Because of this, the UK missed out on pioneering FBC technology, before it became internationally recognised as the best way of burning coal. Sited from Seaton Carew, and in the middle of the industrial complex of Teesside, the station was to be built closer to any major urban area than any nuclear power station site had been. To make this acceptable, the station's reactors were to be housed in prestressed concrete pressure vessels. The station under construction in June 1972 The construction of the power station which was undertaken by Nuclear Design & Construction ('NDC'), a consortium backed by English Electric, Babcock International Group and Taylor Woodrow Construction,The UK Magnox and AGR Power Station Projects began in 1969. The construction was delayed in 1970, when the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate declared that they were unhappy with part of the station's boiler design, setting the CEGB back £25 million. The station's reactors were supplied by the National Nuclear Corporation, and the station's generating sets by the General Electric Company. Some fourteen years into construction, the first of the station's two units were commissioned in 1983, the other in 1985. The station first generated electricity commercially on 1 August 1983. Nuclear fuel for Hartlepool power station is delivered and removed via a loading/unloading facility on a 1½ mile branch from the Longlands, Eaglescliffe and Newcastle Line. ==2013 turbine fire== At 19:18 on 20 April 2013 a small fire broke out in the turbine hall of unit 2 at the power station while Reactor 2 was being brought back into service. The fire was caused by an oil leak, and ignited lagging surrounding part of the turbine. Reactor 2 was shut down and cooled, mitigating any threat of nuclear contamination. Emergency services attended the fire from stations across the Cleveland area and the fire was extinguished at 19:53. During the incident, fire cover in the Cleveland area was provided by units from Darlington and County Durham. ==Specification== The station is of the advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) type. It provides electricity for over 3% of the UK using two 1575 MWth advanced gas-cooled reactors to power two 660 MWe generators, giving a maximum generating capacity of 1,320 MW. The station's net electrical output is 1,190 MW. This is enough electricity to power 1.5 million homes. There are 4 × 17.5 MW auxiliary gas turbines on the site, these had first been commissioned in October 1973. ==Visitors' centre== In the 1980s there was an interactive visitors' centre on site. There was also an activity centre for school visits which hosted a number of special events. Tours of the power station itself also took place. The centre was closed after privatisation in the 1990s, but has now been reopened by current operators EDF Energy. == Future of the station == The power station was originally expected to shut down in 2009, but was given permission by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) for an extension of five years in 2007, meaning that it could continue to generate until 2014. In 2010, the lifetime was further extended by another five years, so that generation can continue until 2019. The company then began work to extend station lifetime to 2024 and beyond,} and an announcement was made in November 2013 that the plant would have a further extension to its operating life of 5 years taking the expected decommissioning date to 2024. === New station === In July 2008, the plant's then-operator British Energy, suggested that the site would be a good location for a replacement nuclear power station. Then a year later in July 2009, the UK government named Hartlepool on a list of eleven sites in England and Wales, where new nuclear power stations could be built. On 9 November 2009, the government announced that ten of these sites, including Hartlepool, had been given the go-ahead for the construction of new reactors. If built, the station would use reactors capable of generating 1,800 MW each. It would cost between £5 billion and £6 billion to construct, would employ up to 3,000 construction workers for the possible eight-year construction period, as well as providing 600 full-time jobs once completed. The new station has an anticipated operating life of 60 years. The plans are opposed by environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth and Stop New Nuclear. ==See also== *Nuclear power in the United Kingdom *Energy policy of the United Kingdom *Energy use and conservation in the United Kingdom == References == ==External links== * Hartlepool, Nuclear Engineering International wall chart, 1969 * A selection of over a hundred images showing the building of the power station submitted by a local who worked at the site during its construction Category:Buildings and structures in the Borough of Hartlepool Category:Nuclear power stations using Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors Category:Power stations in North East England Category:1983 establishments in England Category:Nuclear power stations in England Category:Nuclear power stations with proposed reactors ","title":"Hartlepool Nuclear Power Station"},{"id":"3239717","text":"Madame Masque (birth name Giulietta Nefaria but legally renamed Whitney Frost) is a fictional character, a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Frost called the child Whitney and raised her as his own. As a young adult, Whitney was a debutante and socialite, and became engaged to politician Roger Vane. Following the Frosts' deaths, Count Nefaria approached Whitney and revealed her true parentage, telling her that Nefaria wants her to take her true father's place as leader of the Maggia, a Mafia-like organization based on the East Coast of the United States. Whitney at first refused, but when she tells Roger about her father, Roger leaves her, afraid that her connections to a known criminal would hamper a political career.Whitney accepted her father's offer to become a professional criminal mastermind and was trained by the Count in strategy, criminal activities and combat.

Masque tries to convince her the Avengers are benevolent and that she should reach out to Stark again, but Whitney is still too fearful to do so. She continues to be a criminal figure of importance, until her father returns from the dead once again and destroys her base. She reluctantly assists the Avengers and the Thunderbolts against Nefaria, but she secretly plans to betray and destroy both sides, her increased paranoia causing her to believe that both sides want only to kill her, despite moments of doubt such as when Stark unmasks in her presence but lowers his face-plate back when preparing to talk to the rest of the Avengers. Masque again tries unsuccessfully to convince her to side with the heroes, then joins the battle in Whitney's place. Masque uses a weapon designed to disrupt Nefaria's ionic energy that Whitney was saving until the Avengers were dead and Nefaria weakened, and is slain by Nefaria before she can fire the weapon. Madame Masque is shocked by her duplicate's nobility and sacrifice, with Iron Man's dismayed reaction at what appears to be her death compared to Nefaria's glee forcing her to recognize that her duplicate was right about the Avengers. Whitney joins the battle and plays a key role in her father's defeat, her weapon causing him to begin leaking ionic energy until he finally collapses. She renounces her criminal past, and MACH-II of the Thunderbolts offers her membership, but she declines, departing to parts unknown to consider her future.

He made his debut in comics at fifteen, continuing his father's humorous series Doña Urraca (Mrs. Magpie) after his death in 1960, under the pseudonym \\"Jordi\\". While this could support his family, it did not satisfy his artistic ambitions that were inspired by artists such as Hal Foster, Alex Raymond and Milton Caniff. From 1962, Bernet developed a more realistic style, and took on smaller assignments from Italian and British publishers, until he started illustrating for the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Spirou in 1965. He drew the series Dan Lacombe with his uncle Miguel Cussó as writer, and created a similar series Paul Foran with writer José Larraz, but due to disagreements over editing decisions by Dupuis, Bernet ended the relationship with Spirou. Turning to the German market, in the 1970s he collaborated with Cussó to create Wat 69, a sexy and humouristic heroine for the magazine Pip, and Andrax, a science fiction series for Primo, which both became successful in Germany. ===Later work=== After the fall of Franco, Bernet returned to Spain and worked for several Spanish comics magazines such as Creepy, Metropol and Cimoc, eventually meeting three writers with whom he would form productive partnerships. With Antonio Segura he created the amazone fantasy series Sarvan, and the series Kraken, depicting a sewer monster terrorizing a futuristic fascist society. Bernet's work for the US market included illustrating an origin story of Jonah Hex. Bernet first collaborated with Enrique Sánchez Abulí on several short stories, collected in Historietas negras. When Alex Toth, after producing two stories of Torpedo 1936 in 1981, decided he did not share Abulí's darkly humorous view of mankind and parted with the project, Bernet was asked to continue the work. This became the beginning of a long-lasting series, which became a popular success and was awarded at the Angoulême International Comics Festival. It eventually formed the basis of its own magazine, Luca Torelli es Torpedo in 1992. Later collaborations with Abulí include De vuelta a casa, La naturaleza de la bestia: Ab Irato and Snake: por un puñado de dolares. Bernet also formed a creative partnership with the Argentine writer Carlos Trillo, resulting in the sexually explicit series Cicca Dum-Dum, the less lewd and more comical series Clara de noche, and several one-shots, including Custer, Light and Bold and Ivánpiire.

The district comprised the north-western part of present-day Šumadija and Western Serbia. Between 1922 and 1929, Podrinje Oblast existed in roughly the same area also with its seat in Šabac. In 1929, a large province of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia known as the Drina Banovina was formed with its capital in Sarajevo. Drina Banovina included western parts of present-day Serbia and eastern parts of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. Following World War II Axis occupation in 1941, the province was abolished and its territory was divided between the Independent State of Croatia and the area governed by the Military Administration in Serbia. In 1941 Yugoslav Partisans liberated the large western part of the German occupied territory. In this territory they proclaimed the Republic of Užice (Uzička Republika) with Užice city as the centre of the Republic. This large free territory was an island of freedom in Nazi occupied Europe. The Republic of Užice was short- lived. German troops occupied the territory again, while the majority of Partisan forces escaped towards Bosnia. When the Bosnian War broke out in 1992, the Drina Valley became the focus of a bitter campaign of ethnic cleansing by Serb forcesBećir Bogilović's evidence at Orić trial, 21 March 2005, ICTY, p. 6367 , icty.org; retrieved 31 July 2010. which eventually culminated in the Srebrenica genocide in July 1995.

It was an urban district from about 1894 to 1974. The population at the census of 2011 was 6,625. ==History== Its name means “village (or farmstead) where rushes grow”. In late 1776, a handloom weavers shop in Rishton, belonging to Thomas Duxbury may have been the first place that the cotton cloth calico was woven for sale in Great Britain. Rishton Colliery on the Burnley Coalfield was begun by P.W. Pickup Ltd in late November 1884 and mining continued until 1941. A tramroad from the pit connected to a coaling wharf on the canal. The National Coal Board used it as a pumping station from 1955 until 1970. ==Governance== The two tiers of local government are Hyndburn Borough Council (a non-metropolitan district with borough status) and Lancashire County Council. Prior to the creation of Hyndburn district in 1974, Rishton had been an urban district, with its own council. It is not within a civil parish. Rishton currently has six elected representatives, all of whom are Labour: Graham Jones MP, two County Councillors (Miles Parkinson and Jenny Molineux) and three Borough Councillors (Michael Miller, Jeff Scales, Kate Walsh). ==Geography== Rishton is situated in an area of low moorland north east of Blackburn and north west of Accrington. Its elevation above sea level varies from in the east, where Norden Brook flows into the River Hyndburn, to on Rishton Height, north west of the town. ===Geology=== Around 0.7 miles from the town is a former sandstone quarry, known locally as Star Delph Quarry. Its use as a sandstone quarry ended in 1897. Part of the quarry contains rocks formed around 314 to 315 million years ago in the Carboniferous period, These rocks contain an imprint from where the roots of a Lepidodendron, which are known as Stigmaria. This quarry is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and so it is protected by law with those that damage the site facing fines. The exposed rock layers are Fletcher Bank Grit, this is a subgroup of the Millstone Grit. ==Demography== The 2001 census recorded a population of 7,350, in 2,973 households. 97% of the population were in the White British ethnic group. The 2011 census recorded a population of 6,625 - a decrease of 9.8% from ten years earlier. 96% of the population were in the White British ethnic group. 74.8% of residents identified only as English , while 11.2% identified only as British, and 10.9% identified as British and English. A majority of residents identified as Christian (76.6%), with 16.4% identifying as irreligious, as well as small minorities of Muslims (0.8%) and Buddhists (0.6%) existing in the town. ==Transport== The main road through Rishton is the A678 Blackburn to Burnley Road; there is also the B6535 (formerly A6064), which connects the town to Great Harwood. The Blackburn Southern Bypass section of the M65 motorway opened in December 1997, bypassing the A678. In the 19th century, the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was a major transport route in the area. The section of the canal through Rishton was completed in 1810. Rishton Reservoir, which provides water to the canal, was built in 1828. The East Lancashire Railway, which was opened in 1848, crossed the reservoir on a viaduct until 1858; it is now on an embankment. Rishton railway station, south west of the town centre, is on the East Lancashire line. As of 2018, the route is operated by Northern, and consists of one train per hour between Blackpool South and Colne. Bus services are more frequent, and include the Hyndburn Circular routes and Route 152, both operated by Blackburn Bus Company. ==Sport== ===Cricket=== Rishton has over the years been famous for its cricket team, based at Rishton Cricket Club. Notable professionals who have played for the club include Viv Richards in 1987. Other former professionals include former England coach Duncan Fletcher, Michael Holding (former West Indies international), Aussie fast bowler Jason Gillespie, former South African cricket captain Allan Donald and Sri Lankan right-handed batsman and right arm offbreak bowler Kumar Dharmasena. See Rishton Cricket Club ===Football=== Rishton United FC provides junior and senior football for over 20 teams for both children and adults. The football club is currently developing its own ground known as the Primtetime Project located next to the canal behind Hyndburn Academy. This will see the club have its own grass pitches and in time, clubhouse and parking. The club has teams ranging from nippers (U7s) through to U16s and men's senior teams. ===Golf=== Rishton Golf Club is located off Petre Crescent, and is an eleven- hole course. ===Sailing=== Sailing has taken place on Rishton Reservoir since the start of the 20th century.

They were written when the composer was 57, and are among the last pieces he wrote for piano. Green Ways sets out to depict in music quotations from A. E. Housman (with whom he had a close affinity), William Shakespeare and Thomas Nashe, and is full of typical Ireland lyricism and flowing harmonies. ==The Cherry Tree== The Cherry Tree is prefixed with the last stanza from Loveliest of Trees, the second poem in the collection A Shropshire Lad (1896) by A. E. Housman: : And since to look at things in bloom : Fifty springs are little room, : About the woodlands I will go : To see the cherry hung with snow.'' The piece is very rich in colour and tone and is in a very resonant D major all the way through, except for the central section that is not key-signatured. The tempo marking is = 120, though it is common practice to slow this down to 104108, allowing a more comfortable ride but losing none of the richness. The notes lie comfortably under the hands (a common characteristic with much of Ireland's piano works - for example, his Piano Concerto in E-flat major is an ideal work for the gifted pianist with smaller hands) once one becomes used to the colourful harmonies. This is a popular piece among pianists due to the opportunities to show a personal response to the music. Good legato fingering and confident flutter pedalling is required to bring out the tones, and a good balance between the voices must be adhered to. The piece carries a dedication to Herbert S. Brown and appeared in the 1999-2000 Associated Board Grade 8 syllabus for the piano.Piano Examination Pieces 1999-2000, Grade 8, The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music == Cypress == Cypress is prefixed with the following line from Twelfth Night by William Shakespeare, sung by the Clown in Duke Orsino's palace (Act II, Scene IV): : Come away, come away, death, : And in sad cypress let me be laid.'' The main motif for this work is the soft mournful notes in the left hand and the start and the end. Over this, a light chanting can be heard that is reminiscent of a funeral song or lament. The piece reaches a climax in the middle with rising and descending chromatics played between a series a dissonant chords. The ending recapitulates on the opening section and draws the death song to a close. The bleakness inherent in the piece is compounded by a 5/4 time signature at an Andante mesto pace throughout, which never allows the listener to feel any regular rhythm or comfort. The key is a very melancholic F minor, though the cadences and chord progressions employed by Ireland are never finished and are constantly left hanging, even on the final chord. This piece carries a dedication to Alfred Chenhalls. == The Palm and May == The Palm and May is prefixed with the fifth line from Spring, the Sweet Spring, a poem from Thomas Nashe's poem cycle Summer's Last Will and Testament: : The Palm and May make country houses gay.'' This piece, in contrast to the preceding one, is full of mirth and gaiety. The fast tempo markings (Con moto; = 6366) and 6/8 time signature conjure up an image of a country dance or jig. The left hand paints most of the colour in the opening section with constant falling and rising arpeggios, while the right hand introduces the first theme. The E major start soon transposes into a section in A-flat major, where both hands bounce around with a dotted melody which is the second theme. This section turns slightly slower and less jolly with scales up and down in the right hand which rise and get quicker before a brillante slide down the keys leads neatly into a recapitulation of the first theme. The gaiety continues on into a final flourish at the end. The piece carries a dedication to Harriet Cohen. == References == ==External links== * Category:Solo piano pieces by John Ireland Category:1937 compositions Category:Music with dedications ","title":"Green Ways (John Ireland)"},{"id":"3239755","text":"The Greek National Socialist Party (, Elliniko Ethniko Sosialistiko Komma) was a Nazi party founded in Greece in 1932 by George S. Mercouris, a former Cabinet minister. ==History== Established in Athens in December 1932, the National Socialist Party was one of the far right groups active in the country at the time, others including the National Union of Greece (Εθνική Ενωση Ελλάδος), Iron Peace (Σιδηρά Ειρήνη), Trident (Τρίαινα), and National Sovereign State (Εθνικό Κυρίαρχο Κράτος, led by Skilakakis).

The party itself was largely geared towards Italian fascism, although Mercouris himself and some of his main followers were more drawn to the German model. Mercouris was sometimes used as a go-between by the collaborationist government during the German occupation. ==Political support== The Greek party, however did not serve the regime of Ioannis Metaxas, although given the monarchist stance of the party many of its followers were reconciled to the new government. During the Axis occupation of Greece the group was allowed to continue, although it had no real role in the largely military-based Greek government and faced competition from the other extremist movements.Payne, A History of Fascism, p. 427 It had hoped to gain influence but the Germans reasoned that given its chronic lack of popular support it was not expedient to offer the party any power.Mark Mazower, Inside Hitler's Greece,: The Experience of Occupation, 1941-44, Yale University Press, 2001, p. 87 ==References== Category:Greek collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:Defunct nationalist parties in Greece Category:Fascism in Greece Category:1930s in Greece Category:1940s in Greece Category:Political parties established in 1932 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1943 Category:1932 establishments in Greece Category:1943 disestablishments in Greece Category:Nazi parties Category:Collaboration with the Axis Powers Category:Monarchist parties in Greece Category:Far-right political parties in Greece ","title":"Greek National Socialist Party"},{"id":"3239759","text":"Withnell is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Chorley, Lancashire, England.

Buckleboo began as a government town, surveyed in November 1924 and proclaimed on 17 December 1925 by Tom Bridges, the Governor of South Australia. It was named after the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Buckleboo. On 27 July 1989, the extent of the government town was reduced by the removal of land north-west of Myrtle Street. Boundaries for the locality were created in 1999, and included the government town of Buckleboo and the former government town of Moongi. In 2013, a parcel of land was removed from the adjoining locality of Pinkawillinie and added to Buckleboo to ensure that the area once covered by the Buckleboo Pastoral Run was within the locality. Until 2005, Buckleboo was the railhead for one branch of the Eyre Peninsula Railway, a narrow gauge railway which principally hauled grain via Kimba and Cummins to Port Lincoln for export. The silos at the former railway station and the few remaining buildings are surrounded by the Buckleboo Conservation Reserve, proclaimed in 1990. The locality also includes the Moongi Conservation Reserve further along the railway survey, beyond where tracks were ever laid. Moongi also had a school and a Methodist Hall which opened in 1932. The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that the locality of Buckleboo had 48 people living within its boundaries. Buckleboo is home to 'Buckleboo Park' which consists of six tennis courts and an oval for Australian rules football and cricket.

In July 2013, Merlin merged with Save the Children. ==History== Merlin was founded in 1993 by Dr Christopher Besse, Nicholas Mellor and Mark Dalton to create a British charity to send medical teams into disaster zones and then to prevent disease and help develop local health services. Its first mission was to send a convoy to Bosnia carrying £1 million worth of essential food and medicines. Since then Merlin has grown into a specialist charity aimed at responding to natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies, then staying on to rebuild the capacity of local health services. To date, Merlin has worked in over 40 countries and responded to some of the most serious humanitarian emergencies of recent history. These include the Asian tsunami, Darfur and the cyclone in Burma. Merlin has also responded to the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the flooding in Pakistan. In July 2013, Merlin merged with Save the Children. ==Notable activities by region== ===Africa=== Democratic Republic of Congo: Merlin has been working in DRC since 1997 when it provided emergency assistance to refugees in the east of the country. Since 2002, the charity has been working with communities to rebuild over 100 health facilities, providing drugs and training local health staff, ensuring they have the medicines and the expertise to provide good quality health care. Merlin also supports several hospitals, including Kindu Hospital, the largest in Maniema Province, treating 2,000 patients every month. Merlin has worked in Kenya since 1998, running voluntary HIV testing and counseling clinics in Turkana for nomadic pastoralists, and a similar project which supports patients receiving anti-retroviral treatment in the Great Rift Valley. Since many people with TB have also contracted HIV and vice versa, Merlin is working with the Kenyan government to encourage HIV-positive people and TB patients to be tested for both infections. In Nyanza in the western highlands of Kenya, Merlin is training locals to provide home-based care for HIV-positive people. After the re-appearance of malaria in Nyanza, Merlin is training community health workers to identify, to reduce and prevent malaria by raising awareness, by distributing bed nets and by spraying people's homes with insecticide. Merlin health worker in Liberia Liberia: Due to lack of qualified health workers, a dilapidated health infrastructure and insufficient government funds, Liberia's health care system is only beginning to make the transition from an emergency to development phase. Since 1997, Merlin has been working with the Ministry of Health to renovate health facilities, supply medicines and equipment, and train and supervise health workers. Patients queue to see a Merlin doctor in South Sudan Sudan: In 2004, when Merlin's teams began setting up health services, most people made homeless by militia attacks had no opportunity to get medical care. Merlin now operates a network of clinics serving eight settlements which have been inundated by people fleeing the conflict. On average 134,000 are treated every six months. ===Middle East=== Merlin maternal health clinic in Afghanistan Merlin began working in Afghanistan in 1994, providing essential health services for vulnerable people in some of the most remote and hard to reach areas of the country. Reproductive health care in Afghanistan is particularly inadequate, resulting in some of the highest maternal and child mortality rates in the world. For a time only 14% of deliveries were attended by a trained midwife, and in isolated rural areas, women faced a one in three lifetime risk of dying during pregnancy or childbirth. Merlin opened a midwife training centre in Taloqan in the north-eastern province of Takhar in April 2006. Since then many students have graduated and are now providing essential maternal health care for more than 84,000 women. The 2003 Bam earthquake: On 26 December 2003, an earthquake measuring 6.6 on the moment magnitude scale struck the ancient city of Bam in Iran, killing more than 26,000 people and leaving 75,000 homeless. Merlin responded within 72 hours of the disaster, sending in a team to carry out health assessments and to distribute emergency medical supplies, hygiene packs, and essential water and sanitation items. Merlin stayed in Bam for more than a year following the disaster, and helped build or refurbish 32 medical houses and 11 health centres. Merlin was one of the first international humanitarian organisations to enter Baghdad just days after the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime in April 2003. Teams delivered emergency health kits and medical supplies to paediatric hospitals and health clinics throughout Baghdad, focusing on the most vulnerable groups such as women and children. Merlin also helped train and equip local health authorities to restart their activities and rehabilitate their war-ravaged infrastructure. In many areas of Baghdad, water and sanitation systems had become very poorly maintained, with some areas regularly flooded by sewage. In response, Merlin implemented water and sanitation projects, that helped approximately 35,000 people in the Greater Baghdad area. Palestinian Territories: Merlin has worked in the Palestinian Territories since 2002. It has implemented programmes in both Gaza and the West Bank, aiming to increase access to health care and improve rural health care, in particular. In 2007, Merlin began operating exclusively in Qalqilya and Salfit districts of the West Bank – the areas most isolated by the separation barrier. Following the violence in the Gaza Strip in December 2008/January 2009. Merlin has increased community access to primary and specialist medical services through mobile and fixed clinics, and improved the availability of safe blood supplies. It has also conducted home visits and health education to reduce disease through early diagnosis. ===North America=== Merlin launched an emergency response within 48 hours of the earthquake and mobilised a specialised surgical and medical team to Delmas 33, a suburb of Port-au-Prince. On an abandoned tennis court, Merlin established a fully functional, tented surgical hospital.In partnership with Medicos del Mundo (MDM Spain), Merlin is also operating a mobile clinic team in and around the rural areas of Petit Goave and Grand Goave, which are two hours from the capital of Port-au-Prince. The mobile clinic circuit includes seven villages, each of which are underserved with significant health needs. Merlin's teams of doctors and nurses offer basic, maternal and neo-natal health care, while referring more severe cases to local hospitals for secondary treatment as needed ===North Asia=== Following the collapse of communism in the Former Soviet Union, Russia experienced a 42% increase in cases of tuberculosis (TB). Merlin worked for over ten years with TB patients at Tomsk in Siberia. Merlin pioneered treatment methods, combining traditional systems with new home-based treatment, to combat the rise in the disease. The work was so successful that it was adopted by the Russian Ministry of Health as the nationwide flagship programme for TB treatment. Merlin also supported a hospital TB ward, and supported TB-infected prisoners with medical and social support before and after their release. At the close of programmes, TB incidences had fallen by 6% in Tomsk, whereas elsewhere in Russia they had risen by 10%. In 2006 the Russian Federal Security Service accused Merlin and other foreign NGOs of being covers for foreign intelligence gathering operations. However, this is reflective an overall trend of suspicion by the Russian government of NGOs, as in 2012 they passed a law requiring all politically active foreign NGOs to register as 'foreign agents' and to file quarterly reports on their finances. ===Southeast Asia=== Merlin Response Team in Burma in the aftermath of Cyclone NargisCyclone Nargis: The Irrawaddy Delta area of Burma was devastated by Cyclone Nargis in May 2008, leaving more than 130,000 people dead or missing and a million displaced. Since Merlin teams were already working in Burma before the cyclone, they were among the first to deliver a response to the diasaster, setting up first aid points in Laputta and treating at least 250 patients a day in the first week. The Asian tsunami: Merlin arrived in Sri Lanka less than 48 hours after the tsunami disaster of December 2004, and was the first international health non-governemtal organisation to plan a co- ordinated relief effort with the local Ministry of Health. They also had teams on the ground in Indonesia and Burma. By the end of 2007 Merlin had helped an estimated 287,000 households in Ampara and Batticaloa, Sri Lanka, by constructing and rehabilitating clinics and hospitals damaged by conflict and the tsunami. ==Hands Up for Health Workers campaign== Campaign LogoHands Up for Health Workers is Merlin's campaign to combat the global shortage of skilled health workers. Merlin campaigns for national governments and international donors to develop national health workforce plans to train, equip, pay and support health workers in crisis countries. ==Funding== The majority of funds comes from institutional donors, which include the UK's Department for International Development, the United States Agency for International Development and the European Commission. As a member of the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), which coordinates fundraising appeals for major disasters overseas, Merlin also receives an allocation of the total amounts raised. A small but increasing percentage is voluntary income. This includes private grant-making trusts and foundations, companies and donations from members of the public. Individuals organise diverse fundraising events, as well as being sponsored to take part in various 'challenge events' such as: *The London Marathon *The Welsh 3000s *The London to Paris Bike Ride *The Run to the Beat Half Marathon *The Great South Run *Skydiving ==Footnotes== ==References== : : : : : : : : : : :t : : : Category:Health charities in the United Kingdom Category:International organisations based in London Category:Organisations based in the London Borough of Islington Category:Organizations established in 1993 Category:1993 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Medical Emergency Relief International"},{"id":"3239811","text":"Federico Döring Casar (born 13 September 1971) is a Mexican politician from Mexico City affiliated with the National Action Party (PAN).

An absolute discharge is an unconditional discharge whereby the court finds that a crime has technically been committed but that any punishment of the defendant would be inappropriate and the case is closed. In some jurisdictions, an absolute discharge means there is no conviction on the defendant's record, despite the plea of the defendant. A conditional discharge is an order made by a criminal court whereby an offender will not be sentenced for an offence unless a further offence is committed within a stated period. Once the stated period has elapsed and no further offence is committed then the conviction may be removed from the defendant's record. ==Australia== In Australia, offenders can be discharged without being convicted, with or without being placed on a good behaviour bond (or other conditions). The sentencing options vary from state to state. Note that defendants can be discharged without conviction even if they plead guilty to the alleged crime. == Canada == In Canada, a conditional discharge is a sentence passed in criminal court whereby an individual is found guilty of an offence but is deemed not to have been convicted. Although a discharge is not considered a conviction, a record of an absolute or conditional discharge is kept by Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) and by the charging police agency and is purged from the individual's police record after a period of time: one year in the case of an absolute discharge, three years for a conditional discharge.http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cr-cj/pp-er-eng.htm The Criminal Records Act states that except in exceptional circumstances, if the discharge is conditional, no record may be disclosed after three years. No conviction occurs, but the offender is required to fulfill certain conditions as part of the sentence. The offender is put on probation for a period of up to three years. An offender who fails to meet the conditions of the probation or commits another criminal offence during the probation period may be returned to court, have the discharge to be cancelled, and receive a criminal conviction and sentence for both the original offence and breach of probation.http://www.mpss.jus.gov.on.ca/english/corr_serv/comm_corr/probation.html If the conditions of the discharge are met, it becomes an absolute discharge. A court may grant a conditional or absolute discharge only for offences with no minimum penalty and a maximum penalty of less than fourteen years. ==New Zealand== In New Zealand, offenders can be \\"convicted and discharged\\" (a criminal record is received but no other punishment) or \\"discharged without conviction\\" (no punishment and no criminal record). Defendants can be discharged without conviction even if they plead guilty to the alleged crime, usually in cases that the negative impacts of a conviction far outweigh the crime committed. For example, if a high-end businessman is caught in possession of a small quantity of marijuana, the small nature of the crime compared to the effects a conviction, without a sentence, would have may cause him to discharged without conviction. == United Kingdom == ===England and Wales=== In England and Wales, a conditional discharge is a sentence vitiating the finding of guilt in which the offender receives no punishment if in a period set by the court (not more than three years), no further offence is committed. If an offence is committed in that time, the offender may also be re-sentenced for the offence for which a conditional discharge was given. Pursuant section 14 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/6/section/14 and R v Patel [2006] EWCA Crim 2689R v Patel (2006) EWCA Crim 2689 on Bailii the conditional discharge does not constitute a conviction unless the individual breaches the conditional discharge and is resentenced. The end of the rehabilitation period under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 is the day when the conditional discharge order ends or immediately for an absolute discharge. Then, the offence is treated in law for most purposes (such as in court proceedings, employment, and insurance) as if the offender had not committed it. An absolute discharge is a lesser sentence imposed by a court in which no penalty is imposed at all. Exceptionally, however, a court occasionally grants an absolute discharge for a very serious offence when presented with extenuating circumstances (the signalman in the Thirsk rail crash, who was found guilty of manslaughter, is an example). That usually signifies that while a crime may technically have been committed, the imposition of any punishment would, in the opinion of the judge or magistrates, be inappropriate. In 2015, Hubert Chesshyre was found to have sexually abused a choirboy, but a stroke and the onset of dementia made the court find that he was deemed unfit to plead and he was granted an absolute discharge. An initial request in 2015 to have Chesshyre stripped of his honours was denied. In 2018, after an appeal to the victim's Member of Parliament he was stripped of most of his honours and a review into the honours system has been called for. A court passing a discharge may still order the defendant to pay compensation to a victim, pay a contribution towards the prosecution's costs, or be disqualified from driving. A court may grant a discharge only if it is \\"inexpedient to inflict punishment\\" and may not do so for certain firearms offences or \\"three strikes\\" offenders. The law on discharges is set out in sections 12 to 15 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000. In 2008, 9,734 offenders were given absolute discharges (0.7% of sentences) and 87,722 offenders were given conditional discharges (6% of sentences). ===Scotland=== In Scots law, there is no conditional discharge similar to that in England and Wales, but admonition has a similar effect with a conviction recorded although there is no punishment. However, section 246 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 provides that in dealing with cases other than where the sentence is fixed by law (such as murder): *In cases on indictment, if it appears to the court, having regard to the circumstances including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, that it is inexpedient to inflict punishment and that a probation order is not appropriate it may instead of sentencing him make an order discharging him absolutely. *In summary cases, if the court is satisfied that the person committed the offence, and it is of the opinion, having regard to the circumstances including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, that it is inexpedient to inflict punishment and that a probation order is not appropriate may without proceeding to conviction make an order discharging him absolutely. Section 247 further provides that an absolute discharge shall be deemed not to be a conviction for any purpose other than the purposes of the proceedings in which the order is made and of laying it before a court as a previous conviction in subsequent proceedings for another offence, and shall in any event be disregarded for the purposes of any enactment which imposes any disqualification or disability upon convicted persons, or authorises or requires the imposition of any such disqualification or disability. However, courts can consider previous absolute discharges in the same way as they consider previous convictions.Sections 246 and 247 of the 1995 Act ==United States== The concept of absolute or conditional discharge does not exist as such in United States law. However, different jurisdictions within the United States have a variety of analogues. The most direct is the suspended sentence or sentencing to \\"time served\\", meaning time spent in custody until sentencing. Many or most states also have alternative forms of adjudication for which a defendant may apply. Such measures are typically available only to first offenders facing non-felony charges and typically exclude certain types of charges, depending on the state. Such possibilities often include a guilty plea followed by a special form of probation, successful completion of which seals the public record of the case and expunges the offender's criminal record. ==References== Category:Punishments Category:Canadian law Category:English law Category:Sentencing (law) ","title":"Discharge (sentence)"},{"id":"3239866","text":"Burscough Football Club is an English football club based in Burscough, Lancashire. The club is a member of the North West Counties League, and competes in the Premier Division. Its home ground is Victoria Park, Mart Lane, in Burscough. ==History== ===Early days=== The first Burscough Association Football Club was formed in 1880, playing in the Liverpool and District League football before folding in 1900. In 1905 Burscough Rangers were founded and moved to the present Mart Lane ground in 1908. They established many of the traditions carried on by the current club, playing in green and known as the Linnets. In the 1920s they had success winning the Liverpool County Combination Championship three times. In 1926 Rangers purchased a grandstand from Everton and erected it on Victoria Park. The following year they joined the Lancashire Combination but never experienced the same level of success and began to run into financial difficulties, finally folding in 1935. Following World War II the present Burscough club was founded in 1946, starting life in the Liverpool County Combination. In their second season, 1947–48, they achieved a treble, winning the Lancashire Junior Cup, George Mahon Cup and the Liverpool Challenge Cup. Two years later they again claimed the Junior Cup and also won the County Combination title for the first time. In 1952 they won the Liverpool Challenge Cup for a second time. In 1953–54 they joined the Lancashire Combination winning the Second Division Championship in their first season and scoring 155 goals in the process. 1955–56 saw probably the club's greatest ever achievement as they won the First Division Championship. Another milestone was reached in 1959 when they reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time before going down 3–1 to Crewe Alexandra in front of 4,200 at Victoria Park. Another trophy winning spell commenced in 1966–67 season under manager Bobby Langton, the former England winger, as the club completed a hat-trick of Junior Cup successes against South Liverpool at Wigan. The Lancashire Combination First Division title was regained in 1969–70 season. ===1970s and 1980s=== In 1970–71 Burscough joined the Cheshire County League, finishing runners-up to Rossendale United. The following season they won the Liverpool Non-League Senior Cup and in 1974–75 the Cheshire League Cup was lifted. The 'Linnets' also reached the FA Cup first round proper on three other occasions. In 1977, a 1–0 defeat at Blyth Spartans, in 1979, a 3–0 defeat at Sheffield United in front of 14,000 spectators and in 1980, a 2–1 defeat against Altrincham. In 1981 the club became founder members of the North West Counties League, and had the distinction of becoming the league's first ever champions under Bryan Griffiths. A new grandstand seating 250 was built in 1986 to replace the old wooden stand which had stood for 60 years and no longer met ground safety regulations. In the 1989–90 season the club were relegated to Division Two of the league. ===1990s=== The appointment of Russ Perkins as manager in 1991 was to bring about a change in the club's fortunes as Burscough reached the League Cup final and gained promotion back to Division One. In 1992–93 Burscough lost 2–1 to Southport in the Liverpool Senior Cup Final at Goodison Park before 2,000 spectators. Success was achieved by winning the League Challenge Cup with a 2–1 victory over Nantwich Town. 1993–94 was one of the most eventful seasons in Burscough's history as three players, Gary Martindale, Kevin Formby and Alex Russell, joined Football League clubs for substantial fees. Further covered standing accommodation for 500 spectators was erected at Victoria Park during the close season. In May 1995, Burscough appointed John Davison manager. In his first season Burscough went on to win the League Challenge Cup for the second time, beating League champions Flixton 1–0 at Bury. Flixton were again beaten as Burscough also won the annual Champions v Cup Winners Challenge Trophy. In 1997–98, after finishing runners-up in the North West Counties League, the club were promoted to Division One of the Northern Premier League. They also won the League Floodlit Trophy and reached the final of the Liverpool Senior Cup against Liverpool. The Linnets achieved seventh position in their first Northern Premier League season, also reaching the fourth qualifying round of the FA Cup and the final of the Liverpool Senior Cup for the third time in six seasons. In July 1999 nineteen-year-old striker Michael Yates signed for Scottish Premier League side Dundee for a five-figure transfer fee which was a club record at the time. ===2000s=== 1999–2000 saw The Linnets gain promotion to the Premier Division after losing only two games all season and remaining unbeaten away from home, finally finishing in runners-up spot. In their first season in the Premier Division Burscough finished in 15th position, had good runs in the FA Cup and FA Trophy then in July 2001 won the Liverpool Senior Cup for the first-ever time with a 1–0 victory over Conference neighbours Southport. During this period the club had a youth development programme game and one graduate, 19-year-old Lee McEvilly, signed for Rochdale in December 2001 for a club record £20,000 fee. Within 116 days of signing McEvilly had won full international honours for Northern Ireland against Spain. Following the resignation of John Davison the club appointed Shaun Teale as player/manager in May 2002 and the ex-Aston Villa defender went on to lead the club to its greatest-ever achievement as Burscough became the smallest club to win the FA Trophy following a 2–1 victory over Tamworth at Villa Park on 18 May 2003. Played in front of a crowd of 14,296, it was the Linnet's twelfth game in the competition, including a 2-0 quarter final win over holders, and eventual Conference champions, Yeovil. Despite the win, Teale was sacked six weeks later. Former Liverpool, Galatasaray and West Ham United midfielder Mike Marsh was appointed manager but after a poor start to the season Marsh resigned and ex-Southport defender Derek Goulding took over in October 2003. Burscough players before a match The 2003–04 season saw Burscough finish with a run of victories that allowed them to move from the relegation zone into the promotion play-off positions. Despite playing all their games away from home the Linnets went on to reach the play-off final where they only went down at Bradford Park Avenue following extra-time. The 2004–05 season ended in controversy as the Linnets were denied a play-off place following a decision to award three points to other teams for unplayed games against Spennymoor United who could not complete their fixtures. In 2005–06 the club reached the second round of the FA Cup for the first time in their history. In reaching that milestone they defeated League One side Gillingham 3–2 at Victoria Park, before losing to Burton Albion. At the end of the 2006–07 season Burscough enjoyed one of their most successful in history when the Linnets won the Northern Premier League Premier Division and the Lancashire Junior Cup for the first time in 40 years when neighbours Marine were defeated. The league success was only confirmed on the last day of the season when the Linnets won at AFC Telford United. The victory meant they overtook Telford at the top of the table and won the title on goal difference by a single goal from Witton Albion. Further and final success came when NPL First Division champions Buxton were defeated 3–1 in the Peter Swales Shield. This rounded the season off and confirmed Burscough as Treble winners. ===2010s=== In the 2010–11 season, Burscough finished 19th but were reprieved from relegation due to Ilkeston Town folding. In September 2011 former manager Derek Goulding returned to the club, replacing Chris Stammers.http://www.osadvertiser.co.uk/west-lancashire-sport/burscough- fc/2011/09/08/new-burscough-fc-boss-derek-goulding-delighted-to-pick-up-first- win-of-season-80904-29380192/ ? In the 2014–15 season Burscough were relegation favourites, however they went on to reach the play off semi-final in which they were beaten by a strong Spennymoor side. ==Stadium== Entrance to Victoria Park The club play their home games at Victoria Park, in Burscough which has a capacity of 3,054, with a 250-seat grandstand.

The clafoutis is dusted with powdered sugar and served lukewarm, sometimes with cream. A traditional Limousin clafoutis contains not only the flesh of the cherries used, but also the nut-like kernels in the stones. Cherry kernels contain benzaldehyde, the compound responsible for the dominant flavour in almond extract. They also contain a small amount of amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside - a compound potentially capable of releasing cyanide if consumed, but non- toxic in small quantities. ==Origins== The clafoutis comes from the Limousin region of France, and while black cherries are traditional, there are numerous variations using other fruits, including red cherries, plums, prunes, apples, pears, cranberries or blackberries.Larousse Gastronomique, Clarkson Potter Publishers When other kinds of fruit are used instead of cherries, the dish is properly called a flaugnarde.

It is one of the most well-known theaters in Romania since many important Romanian actors began their career here. For over 50 years, Teatrul Tineretului has been a major cultural institution in Romania. ==History== Nevertheless, achieving this status wasn't easy. After World War II, theaters in Romania, like many other cultural institutions, lacked funding and most importantly, help and understanding from the ruling Communist Party. Ion Coman, appointed manager of the theater by the new post-war rulers, unlike most political appointees of that time, loved theater and fell in love with the institution and its people. Ion Coman became overnight, a talent agent, searching for actors, newly graduates of drama schools throughout the country. He encouraged young actors to come to Piatra Neamt, and using his personal connections with the Communist Party, arranged for the newcomers a commodity that few other institutions of that time offered, housing for the young actors. The first generation of actors that put TT in the spotlight included Florin Piersic, Leopoldina Balanuta and Radu (Dodo) Voicescu. Later on, they were followed by Mitica Popescu, Valentin Uritescu, Ileana Stana-Ionescu, Horațiu Mălăele, Gelu Nitu, Florian Pittis, Corneliu Dan Borcia, Florin (Pufi) Macelaru, Ion Musca, Traian Parlog, Mimi Caragiu, Maia Morgenstern, Cornel Nicoara, Liviu Timus, Coca Blos, Oana Albu, Constantin Ghenescu, Cristian Motriuc, and many others. After Ion Coman's tenure ended, managers that followed him continued the same wonderful tradition of encouraging young actors to come to Piatra Neamt. Among them, Edi Covali (director and writer), Emil Mandric (director), Nicolae Scarlat (director), Mircea Zaharia, Dan Borcia (actor), Cornel Nicoara (actor) and the current manager, Liviu Timus (actor). ==External links== *Official site Category:Piatra Neamț Category:Theatres in Romania Category:Buildings and structures in Neamț County Category:Youth theatre companies Category:Tourist attractions in Neamț County ","title":"Teatrul Tineretului"},{"id":"3239914","text":"Mods was a Norwegian rock band formed in Stavanger in 1980.

The pancreas is located in the visceral region, and is a major part of the digestive system required for proper digestion and subsequent assimilation of macronutrient substances required for living. Pancreatic juice is alkaline in nature due to the high concentration of bicarbonate ions. Bicarbonate is useful in neutralizing the acidic gastric acid, allowing for effective enzymic changes. Pancreatic juice secretion is principally regulated by the hormones secretin and cholecystokinin, which are produced by the walls of the duodenum, and by the action of autonomic innervation. The release of these hormones into the blood is stimulated by the entry of the acidic chyme into the duodenum. The coordinated action of the forementioned hormones results in the secretion of a large volume of the pancreatic juice, which is alkaline and enzyme-rich, into duodenum. The pancreas also receives autonomic innervation. The blood flow into pancreas is regulated by sympathetic nerve fibers, while parasympathetic neurons stimulate the activity of acinar and centroacinar cells. Pancreatic secretion is an aqueous solution of bicarbonate originating from the duct cells and enzymes originating from the acinar cells. The bicarbonate assists in neutralising the low pH of the chyme coming from the stomach, while the enzymes assist in the breakdown of the proteins, lipids and carbohydrates for further processing and absorption in the intestines. Pancreatic juice is secreted into the duodenum through duodenal papillae. Some individuals have also an accessory duct, named accessory pancreatic duct, which may be functional (that is, it also empties the contents of the exocine pancreas into the duodenum) or non-functional. ==External links== * * ==References== Category:Digestive system Category:Endocrine system ","title":"Pancreatic juice"},{"id":"3239939","text":"Binary alphabet may refer to: * The members of a binary set in mathematical set theory * A 2-element alphabet, in formal language theory * ASCII ==See also== *Binary numeral system ","title":"Binary alphabet"},{"id":"3239950","text":"John Robert Anderson (born August 27, 1947) is a Canadian-born American psychologist.

(1990). \\"The adaptive character of thought\\". Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. He has published many papers on cognitive psychology, including recent criticism of unjustified claims in mathematics education that lack experimental warrant and sometimes (in extreme cases) contradict known findings in cognitive psychology.. He was also an early leader in research on intelligent tutoring systems, such as cognitive tutors, and many of Anderson's former students, such as Kenneth Koedinger and Neil Heffernan, have become leaders in that area. === Intelligent tutoring systems === Anderson's research has used fMRI brain imaging to study how students learn with intelligent tutoring systems.http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/publications/pubinfo.php?id=819 Most of his studies have looked at neural processes of students while they are solving algebraic equations or proofs. Anderson and colleagues generated a cognitive model that predicted that while students were learning an algebra proof, neuroimages showed decreased activation in a lateral inferior prefrontal region and a predefined fusiform region. This decrease in activity showed an increased fluency in retrieving declarative information, as students required less activity in these regions to solve the problems. === Cognitive stages when solving mathematical problems === In a 2012 study, Anderson and Jon Fincham, a colleague at Carnegie Mellon, examined the cognitive stages participants engaged in when solving mathematical problems. These stages included encoding, planning, solving, and response. The study determined how much time participants spent in each problem solving stage when presented with a mathematical problem. Multi-voxel pattern recognition techniques and Hidden Markov models were used to determine participants' problem solving stages. The results of the study showed that the time spent in the planning stage was dependent on the novelty of the problem. The time spent in the solving stage was dependent on the amount of computation required for the particular problem. Lastly, the time spent in the response stage was dependent on the complexity of the response required by the problem.\\"Discovering the Sequential Structure of Thought\\" === Decomposition Hypothesis === In another study, Anderson and colleagues used a video game task to test the Decomposition Hypothesis, or the idea that a complex cognitive task can be broken down into a set of information processing components. The combination of these components remains the same across different tasks. The study used a cognitive model that predicted behavioral and activation patterns for specific regions in the brain. The predictions involved both tonic activation, which remained stable across brain regions during game play, and phasic activation, which was present only when there was resource competition. The study's results supported the Decomposition Hypothesis. Individual differences were also found in participants' learning gains, which indicated that learning a complex skill is dependent on cognitive capacity limits.http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/publications/pubinfo.php?id=974'''''' == Publications == * 1976.

Strasser believed the original anti-capitalist nature of the NSDAP had been betrayed by Adolf Hitler. The Black Front was composed of former radical members of the NSDAP, who intended to cause a split in the main party. Strasser's organisation published a newspaper, The German Revolution. The Black Front adopted the crossed hammer and sword symbol which is still used by several Strasserite groupings. The organisation was unable to oppose the NSDAP effectively and Hitler’s rise to power proved to be the final straw. Strasser spent the years of the Third Reich in exile, first in Czechoslovakia and later in Canada.

The facility is owned by Boyd Gaming. ==History== The track opened in September 1973, under the direction of Lee Berwick. Berwick was primarily looking for a recognized facility to run Quarter Horses, having earlier held races on his farm in St. Joseph, Louisiana. Delta Downs in Vinton would hold both Quarter Horse and Thoroughbred race meetings, some years in a mixed format. In the 1990s, the track was bought by developer Shawn Scott for $10 million. Shortly thereafter, it was sold for over $100 million to Boyd Gaming after a law was passed allowing for slot machines at Delta Downs. After the purchase, Boyd Gaming made over $120 million in capital improvements. The casino, hotel and track were badly damaged by Hurricane Rita in 2005; the casino and hotel were partially opened two months later. The track was closed for about six months after the hurricane. Fueled by revenue from the slots casino, the quality of racing at Delta Downs has improved. The winter Thoroughbred meeting has produced several stakes-quality horses in recent years. On January 11, 1990, jockey Sylvester Carmouche rode a 5-year-old named Landing Officer through a thick fog to a twenty-four length win. Landing Officer had gone off at 23-1 odds. After the race it was determined that Carmouche had hid Landing Officer in the fog as the other eight horses in the race circled the track and the jockey was subsequently charged with felony theft by fraud. Carmouche was convicted of the charges on March 14, 1990 and he was subsequently banned for ten years from state tracks by the Louisiana Racing Commission but the ban lasted just eight years. Aaron Kuriloff writing for ESPN put Sylvester Carmouche 11th of the top 25 cheats, frauds and scams perpetrated in sports around the globe. ==Track== The track is a oval. There is a Quarter-Horse chute, in addition to a and Thoroughbred chutes. The track surface is a mixture of sand (from the Sabine River) and clay, with a limestone base. The track has stabling for 1,200 horses. The Delta Downs grounds features horse pastures which are visible from the entrance. Draft and miniature horses and thoroughbreds are on display. The Quarter Horse Red River Rebel, owned by Malcom Chiasson, holds the track record as of 2011; he is also the leading money-winning quarter horse in Louisiana.Delta Downs racing website Retrieved 2011-06-02. == Casino == The casino has more than 1,600 slot machines; the racino has only slots, due to restrictions in state law. The hotel has 370 rooms, and 50 suites. ==Racing season== The track usually holds races from November to mid-July, with the Thoroughbred meet beginning in November and the Quarter Horse meet commencing in April. Delta Downs hosts the Grade III, $1,000,000 Delta Jackpot Stakes for 2-year-olds, the Grade III, $500,000 Delta Princess Stakes for 2-year-old fillies, the Restricted Grade I Lee Burwick Futurity, and the Grade II Firecracker Futurity. ==References== Category:Boyd Gaming Category:Tourist attractions in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana Category:Casinos in Louisiana Category:Sports venues in Lake Charles, Louisiana Category:Sports venues in Louisiana Category:Buildings and structures in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana Category:Casino hotels Category:1973 establishments in Louisiana Category:Sports venues completed in 1973 ","title":"Delta Downs"},{"id":"3239961","text":"Encyklopedia PWN can refer to several encyclopedias published by Polish publisher Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe *Wielka Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN - published from 1962 to 1970 *Wielka Encyklopedia PWN - published from 2001 to 2005 *Internetowa encyklopedia PWN, also referred to as 'Nowa encyklopedia powszechna PWN', is a free Internet Encyclopedia published by PWN ","title":"Encyklopedia PWN"},{"id":"3239969","text":"OMEGA official seal OMEGA is the premier counter-terrorism unit of Latvia.

Harris. The leading role was intended for Steve McQueen, who starred in The Blob two years earlier, also produced by Harris and directed by Yeaworth. McQueen passed on the film to make The Magnificent Seven instead. ==Plot== The film is about American men building a harbour on a Caribbean island when they accidentally uncover two dinosaurs that have been frozen in suspended animation for millions of years. They are a Brontosaurus and a Tyrannosaurus rex. That night, during a storm, the beasts are struck by lightning and come back to life. The islanders have no idea that the dinosaurs are alive because of the storm and are now roaming the island. Also awakened is a caveman (Gregg Martell) who befriends Julio, an island boy, and along with the Brontosaurus. The caveman dies while holding a beam in a collapsing mine, allowing others to escape. Meanwhile, the islanders have found refuge from the Tyrannosaurus by hiding in the old fortress, which is protected by a ring of burning fuel. To ensure the Tyrannosaurus does not get in, the hero Bart (Ward Ramsey) drives out to face the beast in a mechanical digger. They duel on the edge of an island cliff and, after a tense fight, the Tyrannosaurus is knocked into water, ending the island terror. The film ends with a picture of the apparently dead Tyrannosaurus on the sea bed. In an ending similar to his previous films The Blob and 4D Man, the words \\"THE END\\" are shown, followed by a question mark. ==Production== Parts of the film were shot on location. Some location shooting took place on the Island of St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The dinosaurs were filmed using the technique of stop-motion animation as well as puppets for close-ups. During special-effects work on this picture, the crew used their Brontosaurus model and miniature jungle set to film a shot for an episode of TV's The Twilight Zone (1959) called \\"The Odyssey of Flight 33\\". A shot of the Tyrannosaurus was borrowed as well for \\"The Secret of Gilligan's Island\\", a third season episode of Gilligan's Island in which Gilligan dreams the castaways are all cave dwellers living on the island in the Stone Age. The roars and growls of the Tyrannosaurus were used numerous times for creatures in The Outer Limits (1963 TV series) in episodes such as The Invisibles, and can also be heard from various other TV monsters. The toy dinosaurs Julio shows everyone at the cantina were Brontosaurus and Tyrannosaurus rex plastic figures made by Marx Toys. Howard Thompson of The New York Times wrote, \\"If ever there was a tired, synthetic, plodding sample of movie junk, it's this 'epic' about two prehistoric animals hauled from an underwater deep-freeze by some island engineers.\\" The film was adapted into a comic book of the same name. ==See also== * List of American films of 1960 ==References== == External links == * * Category:1960 animated films Category:1960 films Category:American films Category:American fantasy films Category:English-language films Category:1960s fantasy films Category:Dinosaur films Category:Films featuring puppetry Category:Films using stop-motion animation Category:Films set in the Caribbean Category:Films shot in the United States Virgin Islands Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Films adapted into comics Category:Films scored by Ronald Stein Category:Resurrection in film ","title":"Dinosaurus!"},{"id":"3239976","text":"Gustaf Samuel Bertil Oscarsson af Ugglas (July 3, 1934-1977) was Party Secretary of the Swedish Moderate Party between 1969 and 1974 and a member of the Swedish Riksdag.

Following the suicide of an outwardly successful neighbor, her friends begin to deal with the problems in their personal lives. Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher) competes for the attention of a new plumber who has moved across the street; Bree Van de Kamp (Marcia Cross) struggles with her failing marriage and ungrateful family; Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria) continues an affair with her sixteen-year-old gardener; and Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman) copes with life as a stay-at- home mother of four. Cherry conceived the idea for the series while watching coverage of the Andrea Yates murder trials, and was fascinated by how women lead lives of quiet desperation. He began writing the script in 2002 and pitched it to several networks throughout the following year. In October 2003, ABC announced that it had picked up the pilot.

According to Nielsen ratings, the episode was watched by 21.6 million viewers on its original American broadcast, becoming the most-watched program of the week. The pilot received extremely positive reviews, with critics complimenting the series' tonal diversity. The cast, particularly the four leads and Sheridan, also received praise. The episode won various awards, including three Emmys. ==Plot== Desperate Housewives focuses on the lives of several residents of the fictitious street of Wisteria Lane. The suburban neighborhood is shocked by the suicide of Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong), who seems to have led an ideal domestic life. Mary Alice's close friends, Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher), Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman), Bree Van de Kamp (Marcia Cross), and Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria), struggle to come to terms with the news. Later, Mary Alice's son, Zach (Cody Kasch), awakens in the middle of the night to find his father, Paul (Mark Moses), unearthing a mysterious chest from the drained swimming pool in their backyard. Susan, a divorced mother, takes interest in Mike Delfino (James Denton), a plumber who has recently moved to Wisteria Lane; however, she faces competition with neighbor Edie Britt (Nicollette Sheridan), a promiscuous serial divorcée. Suspicious that Mike is spending the night with Edie, Susan enters Edie's home uninvited with the pretense of borrowing sugar. While inside, she accidentally knocks over a candle, which sets fire to the entire house. Susan flees the scene, leaving behind her glass measuring cup. Though wracked with guilt, Susan is relieved to learn that Mike was not the man with whom Edie was fornicating. Meanwhile, Lynette, a former career woman, is frustrated with raising four young children while her husband, Tom (Doug Savant), is constantly away on business. Bree, a perfectionist homemaker who feels unappreciated by her family, is troubled when her husband Rex (Steven Culp) asks for a divorce. She poisons him by mistakenly putting onions, to which he is deathly allergic, in his salad. At the hospital, Rex accuses Bree of being emotionally unavailable and obsessed with achieving domestic perfection. Elsewhere, Gabrielle, a former model, grows increasingly unhappy with her marriage to Carlos (Ricardo Antonio Chavira), who buys her love with extravagant gifts. She continues an affair with her sixteen-year-old gardener, John Rowland (Jesse Metcalfe). Paul asks Susan, Lynette, Bree, and Gabrielle to sort through Mary Alice's belongings, as he cannot bear to do so himself. In a box of Mary Alice's clothes, the women discover a blackmail note reading \\"I know what you did[.] It makes me sick[.] I'm going to tell[.]\\" The postmark indicates that Mary Alice received it the day she killed herself and the women begin to wonder what secret their friend could have been keeping. ==Production== ===Creation and development=== In 2002, Marc Cherry was in a precarious financial situation and was having trouble finding a job. He commented, \\"I was broke, unable to get even an interview for a writing job, and seriously concerned about my future. I had just turned forty and was starting to wonder if I was one of those deluded writers that wander around Hollywood, convincing themselves they're talented when all the evidence points to the contrary.\\"Touchstone Television, p. 6 While watching television coverage of the Andrea Yates trials with his mother, Cherry turned to her and asked, \\"Can you imagine being so desperate that you would do that to your children?\\" to which his mother replied, \\"I've been there.\\" Cherry was intrigued by the idea that a \\"perfectly sane, rational woman could have the life she wanted, being a wife and mother ... and still have moments of insanity;\\" he began writing the pilot episode soon after.\\"Suburbia sizzles in 'Housewives'\\". msnbc.com.

In Europe it emerged in the 16th century and was associated with specific religious and ceremonial occasions. ==Construction== A friction drum is a percussion instrument consisting of a single membrane stretched over a sound box, whose sound is produced by the player causing the membrane to vibrate by friction. The sound box may be a pot or jug or some open-ended hollow object. To produce the friction, the membrane may be directly rubbed with the fingers or through the use of a cloth, or a stick or cord which is attached to the centre of the membrane and then rubbed or moved with a hand, sponge or cloth, generally wet. The membrane may be depressed with the thumb while playing to vary the pitch. When a cord is used the instrument may be referred to as a \\"string drum\\" or \\"lion's roar.\\" In some friction drums, the friction is obtained by spinning the drum around a pivot. ==Use in Western European classical music== The composer Orlando Gibbons (1583-1625) wrote a keyboard fantasia in which he quotes the Dutch melody De Rommelpot. In modern times the friction drum has been used by several Western composers. Edgard Varèse used it in Hyperprism (1924) and Ionisation (1933). Alexander Goehr specifies a “lion’s roar” in his Romanza for cello and orchestra (1968). Carl Orff used a whirled friction drum in A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1934–52) and Benjamin Britten, in his Children’s Crusade, (1969) calls for a string drum to be struck with drumsticks and bowed by means of the stretched string. ==Depictions in Western European paintings== The Rommelpot features in several paintings by Dutch painters, including Two Boys and a Girl Making Music by Jan Miense Molenaer (1629, National Gallery, London) and The Fight Between Carnival and Lent by Pieter Brueghel (1559, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). ==Regional use in Folk music== *Belgium: rommelpot. *Brazil: cuíca, primarily used in Rio de Janeiro-style Carnival samba. A stick is attached to the centre of the membrane and protrudes into the inside of the sound box, which is an open-ended cylinder. The player reaches inside the sound box from the other end to rub the stick. *Denmark: rummelpot or rumlepot. In some parts of Denmark, e.g. Southern Jutland, traditionally groups of masked children go from house to house on New Year’s Eve singing songs to the rhythmic accompaniment of the rummelpot and receiving æbleskiver, sweets or fruits in return. * France: tambour à friction, and local names (brau, bramadèra, brama-topin, petador, pinhaton in the South). Tambour à cordes is used for a string drum, not be confused with the tambourin à cordes, a stringed instrument. *Germany: Brummtopf or Rummelpott. On New Year’s Eve there is a tradition in North Germany in which groups of masked children with homemade instruments, including the Rummelpott, go from house to house singing special Rummelpott songs in Low German, receiving sweets or fruits in return. Adults go out later that evening and typically receive shots of schnapps. * Hungary: köcsögduda (jughorn or jugpipe), especially used in zither orchestras. Leather or parchment is tightened over the top of a large terracotta or wooden jug. A reed or length of horsehair is fastened to the cover and rubbed with a wet hand. * Italy: caccavella or putipù; also known by many other names. The body may be an earthenware pot, a wooden tub or a tin can, with a length of bamboo pierced through an animal skin membrane and rubbed. * Malta: ir-rabbaba or iz-zafzafa. The instrument consists of a tin, wood or clay body with a stretched membrane of cat, goat or rabbit skin which has a stick tied in the centre. The stick is rubbed with a wet sponge. * Netherlands: foekepot or rommelpot. The syllable “foek” is probably meant to be onomatopoeic. It is rubbed with a rosined stick. In some parts of the Netherlands, e.g. on the island of IJsselmonde, it was tradition, until the 1950s, to go from house to house on New Year's Eve singing songs to the rhythmic accompaniment of the rommelpot. This tradition is still maintained in North Holland on the feast of St. Martin. In Brabant rommelpot can also refer to the dance which is accompanied by the instrument. * Poland: burczybas. * Portugal: sarronca. * Romania: buhai (\\"ox\\"), made of a wooden tub or bucket open at both ends with an animal skin tightened over the top and pierced in the middle for a horsehair \\"ox tail\\". This is rubbed with a wet hand. It is traditionally used in the New Year's ritual plugușorul (\\"the little plough\\"), where it reproduces the sound of oxen mooing when pulling the plough. * Russia: gusachyok or gusyok (Russian: Гусачок or гусёк). The top of a clay pot is covered with skin of bull. It is rubbed with a rosined stick. * Slovenia: lončeni bas (pottery bass), also called gudalo or vugaš. The instrument is a clay pot, generally between 20 and 40 cm tall, covered with skin or parchment and with a resin-coated hardwood stick of similar length tied in the center. * Spain: zambomba. This friction drum can be made from a variety of materials and rubbed either with a rod or with rope. It is particularly associated with Christmas, when it used to accompany the singing of carols. * Ukraine: buhay () (also known as bugai, buhai, berebenytsia, bika, buga, bochka).

It is the first school in South Carolina to be home to an International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. Southside is also the defending state AAA Boys' Basketball champions for the second year in a row. Currently it is 226th in the nation for its forensics team. Its Academic team was ranked number 2 in the nation as of last year. Also the school is host to a very successful AFJROTC drill team. == SAT Performance and Graduation Rate == According to a report by the Greenville County School District , Southside students scored 1023 on average on the SATs in 2003. This is 12 points higher than the Greenville County School Average (1011) and 7 points higher than the national public school SAT average (1016). This average may not clearly represent the distinction between the two distinct academic groups present at the school, the local zoned enrollment and the magnet enrollment due to the school's Advanced Placement and IB Diploma Programs. == Advanced Placement and IB Diploma Programs == Southside is the first high school in South Carolina to offer an International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. Southside couples the IB Diploma Program with the opportunity for students to take Advanced Placement Program exams. Many courses taught at the school incorporate expected materials from both programs. In addition, the IB Middle Years Program was implemented during the Fall of 2006; the current Program Coordinator at Southside High School is Dr. Lavetta Collins. Southside offers IB courses in Higher Level (HL) English, Standard Level (SL) and HL Chemistry, SL Biology, SL and HL Physics, AB Initio (introductory), SL, and HL Spanish, AB Initio, SL, and HL French, HL History of the Americas, SL and HL Psychology, SL Studies and HL Mathematics, and Theory of knowledge (IB course). In 2002, 103 students from Southside took 383 AP exams. 45 percent of those exams were scored at 3 or higher (generally considered a passing score). In the same year, 63 students took 230 IB Diploma exams with 63% of these exams scored at 4 or higher. . The school offers AP courses in the following subject areas (as of 2019): Environmental Science, Spanish Language, Spanish Literature, English Literature, French Language, Chemistry, Psychology, AP United States History, Biology, Physics Mech, Physics E&M;, Calculus AB&BC;, World History, and Statistics. == School Activities == === Sports === * Basketball * Football * Soccer * Tennis * Cross Country * Volleyball * Track and Field * Cheerleading * Baseball * Softball == Other Extracurricular Activities == * Academic Team (Quiz Bowl) * Air Force JROTC * Band * Drama Club * Home Economics Club * Kitty Hawk Honor Society * National Forensic League (Competitive Speech & Debate) * National Honor Society * Red Cross Club (American Red Cross) * STEAM Team – (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics Team) / Robotics * Step Team (Stepping (African-American)) * Student Council === Speech and Debate Team === Southside High School's Speech and Debate Team has won many awards since its establishment.

Scorpii) is a triple-star system in the constellation Scorpius lying at a distance of about 6.8 pc (23.6 ly) from Earth. All three of the stars have masses smaller than the Sun. There is a 12th magnitude star close to the other three, but it is not gravitationally bound to the system. To the naked eye, the system appears to be a single faint star of magnitude 5.89. The system has a relatively high proper motion, exceeding 1 second of arc per year. The two brightest stars in this system, GJ 667 A and GJ 667 B, are orbiting each other at an average angular separation of 1.81 arcseconds with a high eccentricity of 0.58. At the estimated distance of this system, this is equivalent to a physical separation of about 12.6 AU, or nearly 13 times the separation of the Earth from the Sun. Their eccentric orbit brings the pair as close as about 5 AU to each other, or as distant as 20 AU, corresponding to an eccentricity of 0.6.Based on a calculated eccentricity value of \\\\scriptstyle e={{r_a-r_p}\\\\over{r_a+r_p}}. This orbit takes approximately 42.15 years to complete and the orbital plane is inclined at an angle of 128° to the line of sight from the Earth. The third star, GJ 667 C, orbits the GJ 667 AB pair at an angular separation of about 30\\", which equates to a minimum separation of 230 AU. GJ 667 C also has a system of two confirmed super-Earths and five additional candidates, though the innermost, GJ 667 Cb, may be a gas dwarf; GJ 667 Cc, and the controversial Cf and Ce, are in the circumstellar habitable zone. == Gliese 667 AB == The largest star in the system, Gliese 667 A (GJ 667 A), is a K-type main-sequence star of stellar classification K3V. It has about 73% of the mass of the Sun and 76% of the Sun's radius, but is radiating only around 12-13% of the luminosity of the Sun. The concentration of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the star's metallicity, is much lower than in the Sun with a relative abundance of around 26% solar. The apparent visual magnitude of this star is 6.29, which, at the star's estimated distance, gives an absolute magnitude of around 7.07 (assuming negligible extinction from interstellar matter). Like the primary, the secondary star Gliese 667 B (GJ 667 B) is a K-type main-sequence star, although it has a slightly later stellar classification of K5V. This star has a mass of about 69% of the Sun, or 95% of the primary's mass, and it is radiating about 5% of the Sun's visual luminosity. The secondary's apparent magnitude is 7.24, giving it an absolute magnitude of around 8.02. == Gliese 667 C == Gliese 667 C is the smallest star in the system, with only around 31% of the mass of the Sun and 42% of the Sun's radius, orbiting approximately 230 AU from the Gliese 667 AB pair. It is a red dwarf with a stellar classification of M1.5. This star is radiating only 1.4% of the Sun's luminosity from its outer atmosphere at a relatively cool effective temperature of 3,700 K. This temperature is what gives it the red- hued glow that is a characteristic of M-type stars. The apparent magnitude of the star is 10.25, giving it an absolute magnitude of about 11.03. It is known to have a system of two planets; claims have been made for five additional planets but this may be an error due to failure to account for correlated noise in the radial velocity data. The red dwarf status of the star would allow the three of its habitable-zone planets (Cc, Cf, and Ce) to receive minimal amounts of ultraviolet radiation. === Planetary system === Artist's impression of Gliese 667 Cb with the Gliese 667 A/B binary in the backgroundtrinary star system Two extrasolar planets, Gliese 667 Cb (GJ 667 Cb) and Cc, have been confirmed orbiting Gliese 667 C by radial velocity measurements of GJ 667. There are also five potential additional planets, though they may be artifacts resulting from correlated noise. Tuomi et al. 2019 detect planets b, c, and d, but do not detect any of the other claimed planets; however, the NASA Exoplanet Archive considers planet d disproven. Planet Cb was first announced by the European Southern Observatory's HARPS group on 19 October 2009. The announcement was made together with 29 other planets, while Cc was first mentioned by the same group in a pre-print made public on 21 November 2011. Announcement of a refereed journal report came on 2 February 2012 by researchers at the University of Göttingen/Carnegie Institution for Science. In this announcement, GJ 667 Cc was described as one of the best candidates yet found to harbor liquid water, and thus, potentially, support life on its surface. A detailed orbital analysis and refined orbital parameters for Gliese 667 Cc were presented. Based on GJ 667 C's bolometric luminosity, GJ 667 Cc would receive 90% of the light Earth does, however much of that electromagnetic radiation would be in the invisible infrared light part of the spectrum. Based on black body temperature calculation, GJ 667 Cc should absorb more overall electromagnetic radiation, making it warmer (277.4 K) and placing it slightly closer to the \\"hot\\" edge of the habitable zone than Earth (254.3 K). From the surface of Gliese 667 Cc, the second confirmed planet out that orbits along the middle of the habitable zone, Gliese 667 C would have an angular diameter of 1.24 degrees–2.3 times\\\\begin{smallmatrix}\\\\frac {h} {{h}_{\\\\odot}}={\\\\left( \\\\frac{{{T}_{\\\\odot}}_{\\\\rm eff}} {{T}_{\\\\rm eff}} \\\\right)^2} *\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{L}} {a}\\\\end{smallmatrix}. where \\\\begin{smallmatrix}{h}\\\\end{smallmatrix} is the angular diameter of the star from the surface of the planet in orbit (GJ667Cc in this case), \\\\begin{smallmatrix}{{h}_{\\\\odot}}\\\\end{smallmatrix} is the angular diameter of the Sun (sol) from the surface of Earth, \\\\begin{smallmatrix}{{T}_{\\\\odot}}_{\\\\rm eff}\\\\end{smallmatrix} is the effective temperature of the Sun (sol), \\\\begin{smallmatrix}{{T}_{\\\\rm eff}}\\\\end{smallmatrix} the effective temperature of the star, \\\\begin{smallmatrix}{L}\\\\end{smallmatrix} is the luminosity of the star as a fraction of the sun's luminosity and \\\\begin{smallmatrix}{a}\\\\end{smallmatrix} is the distance of the planet from the star in AU. This formula has been used as the luminosity and surface temperature published do not agree with the published radius. If you calculate the radius from the formula radius=sqrt(luminosity)/temp^2 (with all units given in multiples of the sun's values), you will see that the luminosity and temperature give a radius of 0.286 times the radius of the sun, not the same figure published in the literature. If you calculate the angular diameter in the sky using a trigonometric formula (atan(distance/radius)*2), the angular diameter derived using this revised radius agrees with the figures given here, by the shortcut formula above, which essentially makes the same calculation. larger than our Sun appears from the surface of the Earth, covering 5.4 times more area–but would still only occupy 0.003 percent of Gliese 667 Cc's sky sphere or 0.006 percent of the visible sky when directly overhead. Of the five additional candidate planets in the system, two of them, Cf and Ce, are within the habitable zone. All seven candidate planets are super-Earths, aside from Cb, which is more likely a gas dwarf due to its eccentric orbit. The controversial Ch would be the least massive of the seven planets, being only 1.1 times more massive than Earth; due to this, it may only be a correlated stellar activity signal.https://www.drewexmachina.com/2014/09/07/habitable-planet-reality- check-gj-667c/ ==References== ==Notesexoplanet art sites: :* :* Category:K-type main-sequence stars Category:M-type main-sequence stars Category:Scorpius (constellation) Category:Planetary systems with two confirmed planets 156384 3 Category:Triple star systems Scorpii, 142 084709 0667 ","title":"Gliese 667"},{"id":"3240024","text":"The National Syndicalist Movement (Portuguese: Movimento Nacional- Sindicalista) was a political movement that briefly flourished in Portugal in the 1930s. Stanley G. Payne defines them as a fascist movement in his typography.Payne, p. 15 ==Development== The MNS emerged amongst a group of students who were associated with the Liga Nacional 28 de maio but had grown disillusioned with its right-wing economic platform.Payne, p. 314 Under the leadership of Francisco Rolão Preto, the National Syndicalists emerged in 1932 from a tradition of Monarchism and Integralismo Lusitano (\\"Lusitanic Integralism\\") to offer a platform that they hoped would lead to full corporatism of association or unionism in opposition to capitalism and communism. They called for a totalitarian state to rule Portugal, although they placed central importance on the Catholic Church and made Catholic identity an important part of their appeal. They adopted the Order of Christ Cross as their emblem, in order to underline their Christian ethos, and set up their own armed militia that became known as the \\"Blueshirts\\" (Camisas azuis) because of the colour of their uniforms (inspired by Benito Mussolini's Blackshirts); they also greeted each other using the Roman salute. Their main inspiration was Italian fascism although they were also linked to the Spanish Falange, who shared many of their ideas. Nonetheless Rolão Preto clashed with José Antonio Primo de Rivera, whom he dubbed \\"too capitalist\\", and the MNS also hinted at wishing to add Spanish Galicia to Portugal, a further source of tension with the Falangist. Brigadas de choque, a form of stormtrooper organisation, were established by the MNS although rarely utilised, with street battles not really a feature of Portuguese politics at the time.Payne, p. 315 They grew rapidly in their early stages and were estimated to have 25,000 members by 1933, 5,000 more than the governing National Union. The National Syndicalists were fairly critical of the regime of António de Oliveira Salazar and the Estado Novo. Salazar allowed the group to hold a national conference in November 1933 and indicating if they abandoned open syndicalism he would be prepared to bring them into his National Union en bloc. Whilst this proposal was not accepted by the MNS as a group many members approved, resulting in a split within the movement in early 1934, with many of those in favour of the moderate approach rewarded with positions within Salazar's government. Salazar announced the dissolution of the group on July 29, 1934, condemning the group for its defense of syndicalism. Salazar used to call the MNS \\"National Communists\\". Despite this official end the National Syndicalists carried on in secret and Rolão Preto helped to lead a conspiracy against the government, which also involved moderate monarchists, some members of the Portuguese Republican Party, and even a few socialists and anarchists who simply wanted to overthrow the regime. The revolt took place on September 10, 1935 but it failed to gain the support of all but a small group of soldiers on board the Bartolomeu Dias warship and in the Lisbon area of Penha de França, being crushed almost immediately. As a result of this Rolão Preto and his deputy Alberto Monsaraz were forced into exile in Spain and the National Syndicalists were fully repressed. The dissidents of the National Syndicalists were subsequently integrated in the União Nacional. ==See also== *National Syndicalism ==References== ===Bibliography=== * *Costa Pinto, Antonio. 2019. \\"The Portuguese “Blue Shirts” and Salazar’s “New State”\\" in Reactionary Nationalists, Fascists and Dictatorships in the Twentieth Century.

As a filmmaker, he worked in Czechoslovakia, the United States, and Canada. Most of his films were directed in tandem with Elmar Klos. The two became best known for their Oscar-winning The Shop on Main Street (Obchod na korze, 1965). As a professor at FAMU (Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts) in Prague, Kadár trained most of the directors who spawned the Czechoslovak New Wave in the 1960s. After moving to the United States, he became professor of film direction at the American Film Institute in Beverly Hills. His personal life as well as his films encompassed and spanned a range of cultures: Jewish, Slovak, Hungarian, Czech, and American. ==Early years== Kadár was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary. Later his family moved to Rožňava, in the newly created Czechoslovakia, where he grew up. Kadár took up the law in Bratislava after high school, but soon transferred to the first Department of Film in Czechoslovakia (probably the third such department in Europe) at the School of Industrial Arts in BratislavaMartin Votruba, \\"Historical and Cultural Background of Slovak Filmmaking.\\" in 1938, where he took classes with Slovak film's notable director Karel Plicka until the department was closed in 1939. Kadár's home town, called Rozsnyó in Hungarian, became part of Hungary again in 1938. With the application of anti-Jewish laws, Kádár was detained in a labor camp. He later said that it was for the first time in his life that he acted as a Jew: He refused conversion and served in a work unit with a yellow armband rather than a white one which was the privilege of those baptized.Barbara Pearce Johnson, et al. Dialogue on Film: Kadar Study Guide (1979).<\\\\--ISSN/ISBN needed--> His parents and sister were murdered in the death camp at Auschwitz. ==Film director== ===Overview=== Kadár began his directing career in Bratislava, Slovakia after World War II with the documentary Life Is Rising from the Ruins (Na troskách vyrastá život, 1945). After several documentaries expressive of the views of the Communist Party, which he joined, Kadár moved to Prague in 1947 and returned to Bratislava temporarily in order to make Kathy (Katka, 1950), his first feature film. Beginning in 1952, he co-directed all his Czechoslovak films with Elmar Klos solely in Prague except their Czech−Slovak projects Death Is Called Engelchen (, , 1963), The Shop on Main Street (Obchod na korze, 1965), and Adrift (, , , 1969) shot with Slovak, Hungarian, and Czech actors on location at Rusovce, Slovakia. Kadár returned to finish the latter one from the United States, where he immigrated in November 1968.Kevin Thomas, \\"Film-maker Finds Freedom.\\" The Los Angeles Times, 9 October 1971. It was his last work with Klos. He then resumed his career in the U.S. and Canada working in both films and television. He was also a popular professor of film directing at the American Film Institute's Center for Advanced Film Studies. ===1950s=== While touting the obligatory Marxist-Leninist doctrine and adhering to Socialist- Realist filmmaking, Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos first bounced between comedy and hard-core propaganda. Kadár's first feature film Kathy (Katka, 1950)Jelena Paštéková, \\"The Context of Slovak Filmmaking during the Imposition of Communism (1948–1955).\\" made before he teamed up with Klos was little different in this respect from their subsequent joint work. Their choice of themes began to change with the first, mild relaxation of communism in Czechoslovakia after Soviet leader Khrushchev's secret speech in 1956. Kadár and Klos's first film during this minor thaw, Three Wishes (Tři přání, 1958), a cagey satire on aspects of everyday life, outraged the authorities and was shelved until the more relaxed conditions in 1963.Peter Hames, \\"Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos\\", The Czechoslovak New Wave (1985).<\\\\--ISSN/ISBN needed--> The studios suspended both directors for two years.Václav Macek, Ján Kadár. Forthcoming. Quoted in \\"Dištanc (1959–1962)\\", Film.sk, 7 August 2007. Their Communist Party membership protected them from a worse fate, however, and Kadár was able to find a refuge in semi-propagandist, technically avant-garde work for the early Czechoslovak multi-screen shows at the Laterna magika (Magic Lantern) project.\\"History\\", Laterna magika; accessed 23 July 2018. ===1960s=== The first feature film Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos were able to make in five years showed a decided return to classical black-and-white film-making with barely a trace of Kadár's more experimental work at the Laterna magika. A gradual relaxation of communist control in Czechoslovakia, whose first signs came from Slovakia, enabled the Bratislava journalist and writer Ladislav Mňačko to publish his novel Death Is Called Engelchen (Smrť sa volá Engelchen, 1959)English translation by George Theiner, 1961. and Kadár and Klos to reach for it from Prague after their suspension was over. The novel and their film Death is Called Engelchen (, , 1963) spotlighted a new take on the massive pro-democratic Slovak revolt of 1944 that previously had been portrayed only as invariably glorious. It showed some of its aspects that brought about human tragedy. The film was entered into the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival where it won a Golden Prize. The directors' next film, Accused aka Defendant (Obžalovaný, 1964), rehashed the propagandist structures of the earlier Socialist-Realist filmmaking, but turned them around by replacing the content mandated in the 1950s with committed social criticism that was quickly becoming one of the hallmarks of Slovak cinema and Czech cinema of the 1960s. All of these experiences and influences intersected to bring Kadár and Klos their enduring success with The Shop on Main Street (Obchod na korze, 1965),Steven Banovac, \\"Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos: The Shop on Main Street (Obchod na korze) 1965, kinokultura.com; accessed 23 July 2018. a compassionate and tormenting depiction of the dead-end street faced by many in Central Europe during the deportations of the Jews to German concentration camps during World War II.Ján Kadár, \\"Not the Six Million but the One\\", criterion.com; accessed 23 July 2018.

Kadár and Klos's work on their next project based on the Hungarian novel Something Is Drifting on the Water (Valamit visz a víz, 1928) by Lajos Zilahy, and, effectively, a remake of the Hungarian film with the English international title Something Is in the Water (Valamit visz a víz, dir. Gusztáv Oláh and Lajos Zilahy, 1943) was interrupted by the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. Kadár and his family quickly resettled in the United States, and although he returned briefly to help finish the film released as Adrift (, , 1969), his involvement was limited by comparison to his previous work with Klos. That was also the last time that the two directors met. ===1970s=== Ján Kadár's first film after immigration to the United States and his first solo feature film since 1950 was The Angel Levine (1970), a substantially modified version of Bernard Malamud's short story Angel Levine (1958). He later directed Lies My Father Told Me in Canada. ==Filmography== * Life Is Rising from the Ruins (Na troskách vyrastá život, 1945) * They Are Personally Responsible for Crimes against Humanity (Sú osobne zodpovední za zločiny proti ľudskosti, 1946) * They Are Personally Responsible for a Betrayal of the National Uprising (Sú osobne zodpovední za zradu na národnom povstaní, 1946) * Katka (1950) * The Hijacking; aka Kidnapped (Únos, 1952) * Music from Mars (Hudba z Marsu, 1954) * House at the Terminus (Tam na konečné, 1957) * Three Wishes (Tři přání, 1958) * Death Is Called Engelchen (, , 1963) * Accused (Obžalovaný, also known as Defendant, 1964) * The Shop on Main Street (Obchod na korze, 1965) * Adrift (, , , 1969) * The Angel Levine (1970) * Lies My Father Told Me (1976) * The Case against Milligan (1976) * Freedom Road (1979) == References == https://uedata.amazon.com/Interview- director-Kadar-making-Father- ebook/dp/B07R7HPBX6/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Jan+Kadar&qid;=1585697787&s;=digital- text&sr;=1-1 Category:1918 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Hungarian film directors Category:Czechoslovak film directors Category:Czechoslovak emigrants to the United States Category:Hungarian Jews Category:American people of Hungarian-Jewish descent Category:People from Budapest Category:Directors of Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award winners ","title":"Ján Kadár"},{"id":"3240067","text":"The black-chinned sparrow (Spizella atrogularis) is a small sparrow.

(eds), Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 8th ed, Vol 2, Chapter 30.9, 2628–2652. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005. The therapy's primary goal is to help the patient overcome internal resistance to experiencing true feelings about the present and past which have been warded off because they are either too frightening or too painful. The technique is intensive in that it aims to help the patient experience these warded-off feelings to the maximum degree possible; it is short-term in that it tries to achieve this experience as quickly as possible; it is dynamic because it involves working with unconscious forces and transference feelings.Davanloo, H. (1995). Intensive short-term psychotherapy with highly resistant patients. I. Handling resistance. In H. Davanloo, Unlocking the unconscious: Selected papers of Habib Davanloo, MD. New York: Wiley. (pp. 1-27).Malan, D. & Coughlin Della Selva, P. (2006). Lives transformed: A revolutionary method of dynamic psychotherapy (Rev. ed.). London: Karnac Books. Patients come to therapy because of either symptoms or interpersonal difficulties. Symptoms include traditional psychological problems like anxiety and depression, but they also include physical symptoms without medically identifiable cause, such as headache, shortness of breath, diarrhea, or sudden weakness. The ISTDP model attributes these to the occurrence of distressing situations where painful or forbidden emotions are triggered outside of awareness.Davanloo, H. (1995). The technique of unlocking the unconscious in patients suffering from functional disorders. Part 1. Restructuring Ego's defenses. In H.

Within psychiatry, these phenomena are classified as \\"Somatoform Disorders\\" in DSM-IV-TR.American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision. Washington, DC American Psychiatric Association, 2000. The therapy itself was developed during the 1960s to 1990s by Habib Davanloo, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst from Montreal. He video recorded patient sessions and watched the recordings in minute detail to determine as precisely as possible what sorts of interventions were most effective in overcoming resistance, which he believed was acting to keep painful or frightening feelings out of awareness and prevent interpersonal closeness.Davanloo, H. (2000). Intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy: Spectrum of psychoneurotic disorders. In H. Davanloo: Intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy: Selected papers of Habib Davanloo, MD. (pp. 1-35) ISTDP is taught by Habib Davanloo at McGill University, as well as in other University and post- graduate settings around the world. The ISTDP Institute offers on-line ISTDP training materials, including introductory videos and skill-building exercises. ==Origins and theoretical foundation== In 1895, Josef Breuer and Sigmund Freud published their Studies on Hysteria, which looked at a series of case studies where patients presented with dramatic neurological symptoms, such as \\"Anna O\\" who suffered headaches, partial paralysis, loss of sensation, and visual disturbances.Freud, S. & Breuer, J. (1957). Studies on Hysteria. In J. Strachey & A. Strachey (Eds. & Trans). New York: Basic Books, Inc. (Original work published 1895) These symptoms did not conform to known patterns of neurological disease, and neurologists were thus unable to account for symptoms in purely anatomical or physiological terms. Breuer's breakthrough was the discovery that symptomatic relief could be brought about by encouraging patients to speak freely about emotionally difficult aspects of their lives. Experiencing these emotions which had been previously outside of awareness seemed to be the curative factor. This cure became known as catharsis, and the experiencing of the previously forbidden or painful emotion was abreaction. Freud tried various techniques to deal with the fact that patients generally seemed resistant to experiencing painful feelings. He moved from hypnosis to free association, interpretation of resistance, and dream interpretation.Gay, P. (2006). Freud: A life for our time. USA: W. W. Norton & Company, Ltd. Pages 49-50, 71-73, 107. With each step, therapy became longer. Freud himself was quite open about the possibility that there were many patients for whom analysis could bring little or no relief, and he discusses the factors in his 1937 paper \\"Analysis Terminable and Interminable.\\"Freud, S. (1937c). Die endliche und die unendliche Analyse. GW, 16; Analysis terminable and interminable. SE, 23: 209-253. From the 1930s through the 1950s, a number of analysts were researching methods of shortening the course of therapy without sacrificing therapeutic effectiveness. These included Sándor Ferenczi, Franz Alexander, Peter Sifneos, David Malan, and Habib Davanloo. One of the first discoveries was that the patients who appeared to benefit most from therapy were those who could rapidly engage, could describe a specific therapeutic focus, and could quickly move to experience their previously warded-off feelings. These also happened to represent those patients who were the healthiest to begin with and therefore had the least need for the therapy being offered. Clinical research revealed that these \\"rapid responders\\" were able to recover quickly with therapy because they were the least traumatised and therefore had the smallest burden of repressed emotion, and so were least resistant to experiencing the emotions related to trauma. However, these patients represented only a small minority of those arriving at psychiatric clinics; the vast majority remained unreachable with the newly developing techniques.Della Selva P. Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy: Theory and Technique. 1996. Wiley and Sons. Cf.: Foreword by David Malan. A number of psychiatrists began directing their psychotherapeutic research into methods of overcoming resistance. Dr. David Malan popularized a model of resistance, known as the Triangle of Conflict, which had first been proposed by Henry Ezriel.Ezriel,H. (1952). Notes on psychoanalytic Group therapy: II .Interpretation. Research Psychiatry,15,119. At the bottom of the triangle are the patient's true, impulse-laden feelings, outside of conscious awareness. When those emotions rise to a certain degree and threaten to break into conscious awareness, they trigger anxiety. The patient manages this anxiety by deploying defences, which lessen anxiety by pushing emotions back into the unconscious. Image:Triangle Of Conflict.pngTriangle of Conflict The emotions at the bottom of Malan's Triangle of Conflict originate in the patient's past, and Malan's second triangle, the Triangle of Persons, originally proposed by Menninger, explains that old emotions generated from the past are triggered in current relationships and also get triggered in the relationship with the therapist.Menninger, K. (1958). Theory of psychoanalytic technique. New York, Basic Books. The question of how maladaptive patterns of interpersonal behaviour could arise from early childhood experiences in the family of origin was postulated within psychoanalytic theory. Independent empirical support came from Bowlby's newly arising field of Attachment Theory. Image:Triangle Of Persons.pngTriangle of Persons ===Bowlby and attachment trauma=== John Bowlby, a British psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, was very interested in the impact on a child of adverse experiences in relation to its primary attachment figures (usually the mother, but often the father and others) in early life. He concluded, in opposition to received psychoanalytic dogma of the day, that childhood experience was far more important than unconscious fantasy. He also elucidated the nature of attachment, a system of behaviours exhibited by human and other mammalian infants which are innate and have the goal of physical proximity to the mother. For instance, a child taken out of its mother's arms cries loudly in protest, and it is only quieted by being restored to its mother's arms. Bowlby observed that the innate attachment system would be activated by loss of proximity to the mother, and that long-lasting trauma to the child could result from attachment interruption. Long term consequences included increased propensity to psychiatric disorders, poor relationship function, and decreased life satisfaction.Bowlby J. Separation. Vol II in Attachment and Loss. 1969. Pimlico. Bowlby conducted numerous studies and noted strong correlations between adverse early-life circumstances—primarily the lack of a consistent and nurturing relationship with the mother—as the source of numerous difficulties, including persistent depression, anxiety, or delinquency in adulthood. Childhood traumatisation to the attachment bond, usually through separation from or loss of the primary mother or mother- substitute, led to adult difficulties. Since Bowlby, the effects of trauma over development have consistently been shown to have a significant detrimental impact on adult psychological functioning.van der Kolk (2005). Developmental Trauma Disorder. Psychiatric Annals ===Davanloo's discovery of the unconscious consequences of attachment trauma=== In the 1960s, while Bowlby was observing children directly, Davanloo was beginning his work with symptomatic and character-disturbed adults. As he began his video-recording work and became progressively successful against higher levels of resistance, he noted that particular themes reappeared with striking consistency in patient after patient.However, Davanloo never considered Bowlby's attachment theory relevant to his work. Davanloo, H. (1995). Intensive short-term psychotherapy with highly resistant patients. I. Handling resistance. In H. Davanloo, Unlocking the unconscious: Selected papers of Habib Davanloo, MD. New York: Wiley. (pp. 1-27). First, the therapist's efforts to get to know the patient's true feelings often aroused a simultaneous mixed feeling in the patient, composed of deep appreciation for the therapist's relentless efforts to get to know the patient deeply, combined with equally deep irritation at the therapist for challenging the patient to abandon long-held resistances which could thwart the therapeutic effort. Davanloo noted, in concert with Malan's Triangle of Conflict, that patients would unconsciously resist the therapist's efforts to get to the root of their difficulties. He also observed, from his videotaped sessions, that patients would simultaneously send off signals of their unconscious anxiety. Davanloo carefully monitored these signals of anxiety and saw that they represented the rise of complex mixed feelings with the therapist. The mix represented that part of the patient seeking relief from painful symptoms but also an active desire to avoid painful, repressed feelings. As Davanloo became more skilled at unlocking the patient's true unconscious feelings, he noted an often very predictable sequence of feelings. The sequence was by no means invariable, but it occurred frequently enough to allow the therapist to hypothesise its existence in a majority of cases. First, after a high rise of mixed feeling with the therapist, manifested as signals of intense anxiety (tension in skeletal muscle, often manifested as wringing of the hands, accompanied with deep, sighing respirations), there would often be a breakthrough of rage, accompanied by an immediate drop in anxiety. This rage, Davanloo discovered, is intensely felt. It often has a violent impulse associated with it, sometimes even a murderous impulse. Once patients feel this rage, they are able to describe vividly detailed fantasies of what the rage would do if it were to take on a life of its own. The rage is a product of thwarted efforts to attach from the past. Those thwarted efforts to love and be loved yield pain, in the form of what Bowlby described as protest. The pain yields a reactive rage at the loved person who thwarted attachment efforts. Complete experiencing of the rageful impulse is typically accompanied by a tremendous relief at finally getting something out which has yearned for release. However, the relief is typically short lived. Next, Davanloo almost invariably noted that patients then experience a tremendous wave of guilt about the rage. The guilt is a product of the fact that the old rageful feelings were with a person who was also loved. It is this guilt, Davanloo discovered, which is the key ingredient in symptom formation and character difficulties. Symptoms and interpersonal difficulties (usually unconscious efforts to ward off intimacy and closeness) are the product of guilt, which turns the rage back on the self. For instance, the rage of a two-year-old toward a mother who dies may be experienced in the present as suicidal feelings (self-directed murderous rage). Beneath the guilty feelings from the past, Davanloo almost invariably noted painful feelings about thwarted efforts at emotional closeness to parents and others in childhood. Finally, at the deepest layer of feelings are the still powerful yearnings for closeness, attachment, and love. The goal of the ISTDP therapist is, as rapidly as possible, to help the patient overcome resistance, and then experience all the waves of mixed, genuine feeling, previously unconscious, triggered by the intense therapeutic process. Those feelings are traced back to their origins in the past, and then both therapist and patient come to understand how the patient came to be the \\"consciously confused, unconsciously driven\\" person in the present. Old pockets of emotion are drained, the patient has a clearer self-narrative, and self-destructive symptoms and defences are renounced. The understanding gained is not just cognitive, but goes to the fundamental, emotional core. The influence of Freud's early trauma theory is evident. ==Specific therapeutic interventions== Davanloo discovered the layers of the dynamic unconscious through a process of developing specific interventions which allow the therapist to reach those layers. Those interventions, applied in a specific fashion at specific times in the therapeutic process, are all calculated to overcome the patient's resistance as quickly and completely as possible, to allow the earliest and fullest experience of true feelings about the present and past as quickly as possible. Those interventions are known as pressure, challenge, and head-on collision. ===I. Pressure: Therapeutic encouragement and reaching through to the patient === Pressure is the principal ingredient of ISTDP, and it takes many forms. Initially, pressure takes the form of encouraging the patient to describe symptoms and interpersonal difficulties as specifically as possible, so both patient and therapist get the clearest picture possible of the precise difficulties. It starts from the moment the patient walks into the room, in the form of the question, \\"Are there some difficulties you are experiencing which you would like us to have a look at?\\" The primary form of pressure is pressure toward feeling. Again, this is exerted mainly in the form of questions, such as, \\"How did you feel toward your boss for humiliating you in front of your staff? We see that you got anxious and depressed, but how did you feel?\\" Pressure can be toward the patient's will: \\"Can we look to your feelings? Do you want us to look to your feelings?\\" Pressure is also exerted toward the therapeutic task: \\"Our goal here, if you want, is to get to the root, the engine, driving your difficulties. So, can we look at a specific time when you experienced anxiety? This will give us a clear picture of the problem which we can use to get to the engine.\\" In its essence, pressure is encouragement from the therapist to the patient. It is encouragement to renounce defences, tolerate anxiety, and walk, with the therapist, into those places which have previously been off-limits. It is a way of saying, \\"There's nothing in there we cannot face together, and we do so in your service, to relieve you of painful difficulties.\\" Patients with low resistance are often quite responsive to pressure alone. However, as explained above, those are the patients who are healthiest to begin with. For patients with higher levels of resistance, usually the product of a more traumatised early phase of life, pressure quickly leads to the patient erecting barriers with the therapist. Those barriers are the patient's habitual defences against avoided feelings. The combination of intentional (conscious) and unintentional (unconscious) defences is called the resistance. The therapist is constantly monitoring for both the rise in anxiety and the appearance of resistance. When resistance does make its appearance, new interventions, in addition to pressure, are called for.Davanloo, H. (2000). Intensive short-term psychotherapy—Central Dynamic Sequence: Phase of Pressure. In H. Davanloo, Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy: Selected papers of Habib Davanloo, MD. New York: Wiley. (pp. 183-208). ===II. Challenge: Pointing out and interrupting defenses in concert with the patient === Challenge is a two-stage process. The first stage is clarification, which is the therapist's effort to confirm that resistance is operating, and also to acquaint the patient with the specific defense being deployed. Patients are often quite unaware of their own defenses. Clarification takes the form of a question, meant to clarify the defense to both patient and therapist: \\"Do you notice that when you speak of being angry with your boss that you smile and giggle? Is a smile something you sometimes do to cover up a deeper feeling?\\" When a defense is properly clarified, both patient and therapist can work together against it, because it represents an obstacle to the therapeutic task of getting to the patient's true feelings. A defense which has not been clarified is still invisible to the patient. It is also important to note that in childhood, defenses can be a useful tool in emotionally overwhelming or traumatic situations. According to Los Angeles- based psychiatrist Katherine Watkins, M.D. “defenses such as dissociation and repression can shield us from intense feelings that we are developmentally unprepared to experience and process. However as we grow up, this shielding cuts us off from our full range of feelings, even when we are now emotionally able to handle the feelings.” Challenge to the defenses represents an exhortation to the patient to abandon the defense: \\"Again you smile when I ask you about feelings in relation to being humiliated by your husband. If you don't smile, how were you truly feeling?\\" This particular intervention is a very powerful one in the therapist's arsenal. As with all powerful interventions, if it is misapplied, the consequences can be severe: rapid misalliance with the therapist, worsening of symptoms, and treatment dropout. This is because the patient perceives a premature challenge, applied when a defense has not been clarified, as a criticism or a personal attack. A common misunderstanding of ISTDP is that the therapist's role is to badger the patient through the use of Challenge. However, the proper use of challenge is as an aid or enhancement to the therapeutic alliance by removing an obstacle to the rise in complex feelings with the therapist. If challenge originates as a product of frustration in the therapist or as a misunderstanding of the unconscious, then stalemate is virtually assured. The main purpose of challenge is to remove any obstacles in the way of the mutually agreed upon task of getting to the engine of the patient's present difficulties: warded- off, complex feelings in relation to traumatizing experiences with important attachment figures in the past. The majority of patients are able to experience their true mixed feelings with a combination of Pressure and properly clarified Challenge. However, a sizable minority of patients erect a massive wall of resistance with the therapist. This wall is erected automatically and is an over-learned, habitual response, used to avoid emotional intimacy, both with the therapist and with other important figures in the patient's personal orbit. When the therapist observes that the patient's resistance has fully crystallized, it is time to deploy the ultimate intervention.Davanloo, H. (2000). Intensive short-term psychotherapy—Central Dynamic Sequence: Phase of Challenge. In H. Davanloo, Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy: Selected papers of Habib Davanloo, MD. New York: Wiley. (pp. 209-234) ===III. Head-on collision: Pointing out the reality of the defenses and encouragement to overcome them=== The Head-on Collision is an intervention aimed not at any single defense but rather aimed at the entire defensive structure being deployed by the patient. It is an urgent appeal to the patient to exert maximal effort to overcome the resistance, and it takes the form of a summary statement to the patient which explains the consequences of continuing to resist: > Let's take a look at what's happening here. You have come on your own free > will, because you are experiencing a problem which causes you pain. We have > set out to get to the root of your difficulties, but every time we attempt > to move toward it, you put up this massive wall. The wall keeps me out, and > it keeps you from knowing your own true feelings. If you keep me out, you > keep me useless. Is that what you want? Because, as you see, you are > certainly capable of keeping me useless to you. My first question is, why > would you want me to be useless? You see, the consequences of this would be > that I would be unable to help you. I'd like to, but the nature of this work > is that I can't help everyone. Sometimes I fail. However, can you afford to > fail? How much longer do you want to carry this burden? This complex intervention is simultaneously aimed at the patient's will, is a reminder of the task, and is a wake-up call to the therapeutic alliance to exert maximal effort against the resistance. It is a reminder, in stark terms, that the therapeutic task is in jeopardy and may well fail. Finally, it is a reminder to the patient of the consequences of failure, as well as an implied reminder that success is also possible.Davanloo, H. (2000). Intensive short- term psychotherapy—Central Dynamic Sequence: Head-On Collision with Resistance. In H. Davanloo, Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy: Selected papers of Habib Davanloo, MD. New York: Wiley. (pp. 235-253) The interventions of Pressure, Challenge, and Head-on Collision, all aimed at helping the patient experience true feelings in relation to the present and past, allowed Davanloo to expand the scope of patients who can be helped by short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy. A model which initially worked only with highly motivated patients able to describe a clearly problematic area can now be applied to patients whose difficulties are diffuse and whose motivation is also initially quite diffuse. The results are deep, lasting changes in areas of both symptomatic and interpersonal disturbances. It is also worth stressing that ISTDP, unlike traditional psychodynamic therapies, assiduously avoids interpretation until such time as the unconscious is open. The use of trial interpretations is explicitly avoided. The phase of interpretation only commences once it is clear to both therapist and patient that there has been a passage of previously unconscious emotion. Quite often, it is then the patient who takes the lead in interpreting: \\"The incredible rage I felt toward you when you refused to let me off the hook regarding my feelings is exactly the same rage that I felt toward my father when I was five years old and found out he had been killed in the war and wasn't coming home. I buried the rage that day because I felt so guilty about it. That's the day I became depressed.\\" ==Evidence base== Davanloo's initial research was published in the form of a qualitative case series of approximately 200 patients. He maintains a large video library of treated cases which he uses for teaching conferences. In the future, this library of clinical data may be made available to psychotherapy researchers who can independently verify and quantify Davanloo's claims. He claims efficacy with psychological symptoms, medically unexplained symptoms (so-called functional or somatoform disorders), and characterological disturbances (referred to as Personality Disorders in DSM). Empirical research into the efficacy of ISTDP, and other brief psychodynamic psychotherapies is active. There are now over 60 published outcome studies in ISTDP including 40 randomized controlled trials for depression, anxiety, personality, somatic symptom and substance use disorders. There are also over 20 studies showing the cost effectiveness of the method through reducing doctor visits, medication costs, hospital costs and disability costs. Summary of cost effectiveness studies to 2018 ISTDP has been investigated for: * Personality Disorders * Depression and Treatment Resistant Depression * Anxiety Disorders * Functional Neurological Disorders * Somatic Symptom Disorders: at least 20 studies as of October 2019 Summary of ISTDP Somatic Condition Studies * Cost effectiveness studies: at least 22 studies as of October 2019: *As an Adjunct to Care in Severe Mental Disorders *Substance Use Disorders A Cochrane systematic review examined the efficacy of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapies for common mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and personality disorders. Without distinguishing between different forms of STDP from Davanloo's ISTDP, modest to large short-term gains were reported for a broad range of people experiencing common mental disorders. Further research is required to determine the effectiveness and long term benefits of psychodynamic psychotherapies for common mental disorders. Neuroscientist and Nobel Prize winner, Eric Kandel refers to Davanloo's technique and its effectiveness in providing relief from emotional disturbances.Kandel, Eric R. In Search of Memory. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2006; pp.369-370. ==Relationship to Cognitive Therapy== Cognitive therapy (CT), developed by Aaron T. Beck, focuses on illogical thoughts as the main driver of emotional difficulties. These beliefs, such as, \\"Everything I attempt inevitably fails,\\" are postulated to cause emotional states like depression or hopelessness. The therapist collaborates with the patient to determine which faulty cognitions are currently accepted by the patient as true. Together, the patient and therapist discover these cognitions and collaboratively explore the evidence for and against them. Relief of symptoms comes from replacing unfounded cognitions with more reality-based thoughts. CBT has been shown effective in numerous trials, particularly for depression and anxiety disorders. While ISTDP accepts the presence of faulty cognitions, the causality is thought to be reversed. The ISTDP therapist would posit that unconscious emotions lead to unconscious anxiety, which is managed by unconscious defences. These defences can certainly include hopeless, helpless, or self-deprecating cognitions. Rather than examining evidence for and against a thought like, \\"I am unable to know my own true feelings,\\" an ISTDP therapist might say, \\"If you adopt that position, which is essentially a position of helplessness, we will not get to the engine driving your difficulties. If you renounce this helpless position, how are you truly feeling right now?\\" Both the CT and ISTDP therapist call the thought into question, with the goal of ultimately liberating the patient. The difference is that the ISTDP therapist sees the faulty cognition as preventing access to the true, buried feelings, while the CT therapist sees the faulty cognition as the cause of the painful emotions leading to the painful psychological state. It may well be the case that causality flows in both directions, dependent on the individual, the emotions, and the cognitions involved. As of this writing, though both CT and ISTDP show good evidence of clinical efficacy, the theoretical question of whether feelings drive thoughts or thoughts drive feelings remains unresolved; it could well be the case that thought and feeling are inextricably bound, and that we have not yet developed adequate psychological or neuroscientific concepts and tools to frame these sorts of questions properly. ==References== ==Further reading== * Abbass, Allan. \\"Reaching through Resistance: Advanced Psychotherapy Tedchniques.

The typhoon formed on June 28, 2002, near the FSM, and for several days it meandered while producing heavy rainfall across the region. On Chuuk, the highest 24-hour precipitation total was 506 mm (19.9 in), which was greater than the average monthly total. The rain produced floods up to deep, causing landslides across the island that killed 47 people. There was also one death on nearby Pohnpei, and damage in the FSM totaled over $100 million. After affecting the FSM, Chataan began a northwest track as an intensifying typhoon. Its eye passed just north of Guam on July 4, though the eyewall moved across the island and dropped heavy rainfall. Totals were highest in southern Guam, peaking at 536 mm (21.1 in). Flooding and landslides from the storm severely damaged or destroyed 1,994 houses. Damage on the island totaled $60.5 million, and there were 23 injuries. The typhoon also affected Rota in the Northern Marianas Islands with gusty winds and light rainfall. Typhoon Chataan attained its peak intensity of 175 km/h (110 mph) on July 8\\\\. It weakened while turning to the north, and after diminishing to a tropical storm Chataan struck eastern Japan on July 10\\\\. High rainfall, peaking at , flooded 10,270 houses. Damage in Japan totaled about $500 million. The name Chataan means \\"rainy day\\" in the Chamorro language, which is spoken on Guam. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) named the storm Gloria while the typhoon was in the vicinity of the country. ==Meteorological history== On June 27, 2002, the monsoon trough spawned a tropical disturbance southwest of Pohnpei. Alt URL The system rapidly organized that day, and at 2000 UTC the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert. Early on June 28, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression near the Mortlock Islands in the Federated States of Micronesia; around the same time, the JTWC also initiated storm advisories. Early on June 29, the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm 08W, and shortly thereafter the JMA named the system Tropical Storm Chataan. After moving northwestward, the storm turned to the east, resuming a northwest track on June 30 due to a subtropical ridge to the north. The track was erratic because the storm had not yet separated from the monsoon trough. By June 30, Chataan had steadily strengthened to severe tropical storm status, with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph). Only July 1, the system's circulation became broad, with most of the convection located west of the center. The next day, Chataan briefly weakened to an intensity of 85 km/h (50 mph), although it began strengthening steadily on July 3, when its center passed very near Weno in Chuck State in the FSM. At 1800 UTC that night, the JTWC upgraded Chataan to a typhoon, and about 24 hours later the JMA followed suit while the storm was approaching Guam from the southeast. At about 2130 UTC on July 4, the eye of Chataan moved across northern Guam in about two hours, although the center of the eye passed north of the island. Severe Tropical Storm Chataan brushing eastern Japan on July 11 After affecting Guam, Chataan continued toward the northwest and gradually intensified. At 0000 UTC on July 8, the typhoon reached its peak intensity of 175 km/h (110 mph 10-minute sustained) while located near the Japanese island of Okinotorishima. The JTWC assessed that Chataan had reached its peak intensity of 240 km/h (150 mph 1-minute sustained) about six hours earlier; on that basis, the agency classified the system as a super typhoon. On July 8, Chataan turned toward the north around the subtropical ridge while maintaining its peak winds for about 18 hours. On July 9 the typhoon turned to the northeast, and late that day it weakened to a severe tropical storm. At around 1530 UTC on July 10, Chataan made landfall on the Bōsō Peninsula in Honshu with winds of about 100 km/h (65 mph 10-minute sustained). The storm briefly moved offshore before making a second landfall on eastern Hokkaido at 1200 UTC on July 11; this marked the first occasion of a July landfall on the island in 28 years. A few hours later, Chataan became an extratropical cyclone in the Sea of Okhotsk, where the remnants stalled before dissipating on July 13 near Sakhalin. ==Preparations and impact== ===Federated States of Micronesia=== While Chataan was in its formative stages and still tied to the monsoon trough, it produced a large area of heavy rainfall and strong winds that affected Pohnpei and Chuuk in the FSM. The storm passed very near Chuuk with wind gusts of 82 km/h (51 mph). In the day before Chataan affected the island, it dropped torrential rainfall due to its elongated structure and slow movement. Persistent winds from the larger monsoon trough generated high surf and tides of 0.3 m (1 ft) above normal across the region. The most significant effects were from the rainfall, peaking at 954 mm (37.5 in) at the Chuuk Weather Service Office over 13 days. The highest 24-hour total was 506 mm (19.9 in) on Weno Island, of which 361 mm (14.2 in) fell in 12 hours; this was greater than the average monthly rainfall total for the station. High winds downed power lines on Chuuk, while surf destroyed seawalls and buildings along the coast. The rains causes severe flooding across the island that reached in some locations, triggering at least 30 mudslides that killed 47 people. This represented the deadliest natural disaster in the island's recorded history. The landslides reached a depth of 4.6 m (15 ft), which destroyed several homes made of tin and concrete. Many people were buried by the landslides or washed into the ocean. Saltwater flooding contaminated the groundwater and destroyed much of the island's crops. Chataan damaged roads and bridges, and high winds downed power lines, which cut communications between islands. Across Chuuk, the storm destroyed about 1,000 homes and left about 1,000 people homeless. About 100 people were injured. In nearby Pohnpei state, Chataan produced 72 km/h (45 mph) winds in Nukuoro. The winds destroyed a house and a weather station. Rainfall on the atoll reached 457 mm (18.0 in). High winds, surf, and rain also affected Sapwuafik. Rough seas killed a person on Pohnpei. Crop damage in the country totaled $3 million, and overall property damage was estimated at $100 million, mostly on Chuuk. ===Guam=== Effects of Typhoon Chataan, including torrential rains and strong winds, on Guam Before Chataan affected Guam, officials canceled U.S. Independence Day festivities, and residents purchased storm supplies. Although the center of the eye did not strike Guam, the eyewall affected the entire island with strong winds and heavy rainfall. The highest sustained winds were estimated at 120 km/h (75 mph), with gusts to 167 km/h (104 mph) at Andersen Air Force Base. Gusts were slightly higher at Apra Harbor, peaking at 170 km/h (106 mph), and gusts may have reached as high as 200 km/h (125 mph). Similar to its effects on Chuuk, Chataan dropped heavy rainfall on Guam, peaking at 536 mm (21.1 in) on Mount Almagosa; the same station reported 311 mm (12.2 in) in about three hours. The Weather Forecast Office on the island reported 265 mm (10.4 in) in a 24-hour period. The rains were less than 250 mm (10 in) in northern Guam, and were highest in the mountainous southern region where the eye crossed. While moving across the island, Chataan produced a significant storm surge that peaked at about 3.6 m (12 ft) in Umatac. High winds caused damage across Guam, mostly to roofs and to poorly built or wooden structures. A total of 1,996 houses were severely damaged or destroyed. Better constructed homes fared well during the storm, and there was little window damage. The winds also downed power lines, leaving an island-wide power outage. John F. Kennedy High School sustained damage to its football field and library. The most significant effects were from the heavy rainfall, resulting in landslides in some areas and causing rivers to flow at above-normal rates; 14 stations reported either record flow rates or peak crests, including an island-wide peak crest of 8.55 m (28.06 ft) at the mouth of the Tolaeyuus River. Two water gauges were destroyed during the storm. Swollen rivers damaged roads, washed away trees, and caused erosion. The storm flooding contaminated Fena Lake, which provides water to the military base, for a few days. In addition, 34 of the island's 110 water wells failed due to the storm. Flooding also destroyed a building and damaged the runway at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport, and damaged a bridge near Inarajan. A few palm trees fell due to the soil being loosened, either from heavy rains or high waves. Some of the downed trees struck cars, but the winds were not strong enough to overturn any vehicles. In the higher elevations of Guam, some areas experienced heavy crop damage due to strong winds; however, crop damage in general was less than expected, estimated at around $500,000. In Apra Harbor, high seas washed ashore or sank five boats, and a Navy barge spilled 397,000 litres (105,000 gallons) of oil. Overall, Chataan caused about $60 million in property damage on Guam, and there were 23 injuries, none of them serious. ===Elsewhere=== Flood waters from Chataan in Kōriyama, Fukushima North of Guam, Chataan affected Rota with 74 km/h (46 mph) sustained winds and gusts to 120 km/h (75 mph) at the island's airport. Rainfall was much less than elsewhere in the typhoon's path, and a 24-hour total of 38.6 mm (1.52 in) was reported at Rota's airport. The storm inflicted heavy damage to crops and fisheries, and 60% of farmers reported a total loss. Chataan also damaged roads on the island, many due to fallen trees. Nine huts were destroyed, and damage was estimated at $2.7 million. Energy from the typhoon enhanced monsoonal moisture over the Philippines, in conjunction with Tropical Storm Nakri. The two storms contributed to heavy rainfall that triggered floods and landslides, which closed roads and highways. High waves killed three people after a boat overturned. The storm destroyed 566 houses and damaged another 2,363. A total of 31,813 people evacuated to 184 government-opened shelters. Officials canceled classes during the system; several schools were used as temporary shelters. Damage totaled over $1.5 million (₱64 million pesos), and the floods killed 58 people. The last location Chataan affected was Japan. The typhoon forced the cancellation of 316 flights and 150 train trips. The expressway between Shizuoka and Tokyo was closed. At least 396 schools were closed in the country, and a baseball game between the Yokohama DeNA BayStars and the Yakult Swallows was canceled due to the inclement weather. Toyota temporarily closed most of its factories in the country. Heavy rainfall, peaking at in Gifu Prefecture, fell across Japan. The rains flooded 10,270 houses in the country, resulting in evacuation orders for about 145,000 people. The floods damaged roads in 338 locations, and at least 10 bridges were destroyed. About 15,000 evacuees were in Ogaki after a river exceeded its banks. High rainfall caused hundreds of landslides, two of which resulted in a death. Floods killed at least three people. Winds from the typhoon peaked at 97 km/h (60 mph) at Hachijō-jima. High winds in Sakai, Osaka damaged 20 houses. In Tokyo, the storm produced light winds and rains, despite passing within 102 km (63 mi). Chataan destroyed 21 homes and damaged 239 others to some degree. During its passage, the typhoon destroyed of crops. The typhoon killed six people, left one person missing, and injured 30 others. Overall damage in Japan totaled about $500 million (¥59 billion 2002 JPY). During the storm, Yahoo! Japan received a record 359 million views, mostly due to people checking the website's weather section. ==Aftermath== Downed tree on Guam After Chataan affected Chuuk state, the island's residents were in need of food, clothes and medicine. Only a few crops were not destroyed by the storm; much of the breadfruit was stripped from the trees, and fruit not destroyed by the storm were damaged by parasites. In the days after the storm, the local Red Cross deployed about 100 volunteers to search for victims buried by landslides. However, rescue operations were hampered by persistent flooding after the storm. Initially the death toll was unknown, and it was feared that hundreds of people had been killed. Six people who were seriously injured on Chuuk were flown to The Queen's Medical Center in Hawaii for treatment; they were initially scheduled to fly to Guam Memorial Hospital, but the facility was full. About 2,000 residents affected by the storm evacuated to government- run shelters. The Red Cross shipped various relief supplies, including raincoats and water, to the affected areas. By July 4, power systems were restored and the airport reopened. Although there was enough food in the immediate aftermath, the destruction of crops and cattle posed a long-term food shortage. On July 3 while Chataan was passing the region, the governor of Chuuk declared a state of emergency, requesting international assistance. On July 9, the government of Japan sent $87,000 (¥10 million) worth of supplies to Micronesia, including 1,000 blankets and 10 electric generators. Two days later, United States President George W. Bush declared the island as a disaster area. This was six days after FSM President Leo Falcam sent the disaster declaration to the US president, although Falcam had improperly filed the paperwork. Because the FSM is in a Compact of Free Association and not a U.S. state, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) could not provide immediate assistance. During the delay, a group of doctors from Guam flew to Chuuk to provide medical assistance. On July 11, the government of Israel sent $5,000 worth of medicine to the FSM. The next day, the Caritas charity in Australia sent $20,000 worth of water and food. Residents from elsewhere in the FSM sent clothes and food. The Australian government sent $10,000 to replenish emergency supplies, and the International Red Cross released about $20,000 for immediate relief. The government of China sent $30,000 worth of aid. On July 30, FEMA announced that residents and business owners in Chuuk could apply for individual assistance, including money for housing, repairing damage, and low-interest loans. The declaration would not apply to outer islands in Chuuk, which did not sustain significant damage; this is because FEMA only had funds to restore areas to how they were before the storm. Ultimately, FEMA provided of water, 1,300 blankets, 45,360 km (100,000 lbs) of rice, 11,328 meals ready to eat, and various other supplies. In total, the agency allocated $10.6 million, mostly in the form of individual assistance that provided money for purchasing lost supplies. FEMA ultimately sent just under $5 million to Chuuk after Chataan, as well as subsequent typhoons Pongsona and Lupit; however, about $445,000 of the funding was believed to have been misspent due to discrepancies discovered in an audit in 2006. In the days after the storm, thousands of people on Guam evacuated to the 15 government shelters set up in schools across the island; the total reached 3,947 people on July 10. The governor of Guam declared a state of emergency after the storm, and on July 6 President Bush declared the island a major disaster area; this allocated federal funding to assist in removing debris and other emergency services. A week later, the declaration was extended to include individual assistance for anyone who experienced damage from the storm. The Fena Lake reservoir experienced excess silt deposit after excessive rainfall from Chataan, which prevented water distribution from the facility; on July 19 – fifteen days after the typhoon's landfall – water production resumed. Before the facility reopened, the Guam Waterworks Authority distributed water to the island at differing times of the day to ration the limited supply. However, by a month after the storm, residents were still required to boil water as a precaution. About five days after Chataan struck Guam, Typhoon Halong affected the island and caused further power outages. Some areas on the island remained without power for over a week, due to electric workers restoring the main transmission lines before fixing individual lines. By July 19, 23% of those who lost power still were without electricity, mostly in outlying areas. By that date, trash collection was restored, and government-opened shelters were closed. Later in July, flooding washed debris from Chataan and clogged two rivers. The oil spill in Apra Harbor was cleaned at three of seven affected locations by August 19. In the months after the storm, tourism decreased further after a decline that began after the September 11 attacks. Ultimately, FEMA provided $73 million in assistance to the territory, including $10 million in housing checks to 5,947 people and $6.5 million worth of food stamps for 79,814 people. The agency provided $10 million for debris removal and rebuilding public buildings. In December 2002, Typhoon Pongsona struck Guam and caused additional flooding and damage. On August 7, President George W. Bush also declared Rota to be a disaster area, which provided funding for debris removal. ===Retirement=== Because of the storm's death toll and damage, the name Chataan became retired and was replaced with Matmo in 2004. Countries in the World Meteorological Organization can request tropical cyclone names to be retired if a storm caused unusually heavy damage. With PAGASA, they retired the name Gloria and was replaced with Glenda in 2006; the agency sought to be apolitical after Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo won a disputed presidential election in 2004. ==See also== *List of Equatorial tropical cyclones *Typhoon Neoguri (2014) *Typhoon Halong (2002) ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *RSMC Tokyo – Typhoon Center **Best Track Data of Typhoon Chataan (0206) **Best Track Data (Graphics) of Typhoon Chataan (0206) **Best Track Data (Text) *JTWC Best Track Data of Super Typhoon 08W (Chataan) Category:2002 in Guam Typhoon Chataan Category:2002 in the Federated States of Micronesia Category:2002 Pacific typhoon season Category:Retired Pacific typhoons Category:Typhoons Category:Typhoons in Guam Category:Typhoons in Japan Category:Typhoons in the Federated States of Micronesia Chataan ","title":"Typhoon Chataan"},{"id":"3240103","text":"Weber at WIND Radio, 1976.

It was the country's first international airport and was the only international airport in Sri Lanka until the inauguration of Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake in 1967. The airport currently serves several domestic services and is home to several aviation training organisations. A relaxation of rules has recently seen the airport open for international corporate jet operations and charter flights. The airport is located 15 km south of the Colombo City. The strategic significance of Colombo airport, Ratmalana has been identified along with the emerging Colombo Financial City, High End Tourism and business travel needs of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs). The long-term strategic goal of RMA is to bring the airport to the optimum operational capacity by maximum utilization of existing resources. Therefore, to achieve this goal, five strategic areas with specific strategies have been identified as Corporate Jet Operations, Domestic Aviation Hub, Aviation Training hub in the Region, FBO & MRO investments and Regional Airports Operations. ==History== ===Launch=== In 1934 the State Council of Ceylon made a decision to construct an aerodrome within reach of the capital city of Colombo and decided on Ratmalana as the best site. On 27 November 1935 a De Havilland Puss Moth flown by Captain Tyndale- Biscoe, chief flying instructor of the Madras Flying Club, was the first aircraft to land at the new airport. ===Second World War=== Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) English Electric Canberra B.Mk.20 bomber, A84-202, taxiing to the runway at Colombo-Ratmalana Airport during a refuelling stop in the 1953 London to Christchurch air race During the Second World War it was used as a Royal Air Force airfield, with No 30 Squadron flying Hawker Hurricanes from there against Japanese Navy aircraft. QEA flew civilianised Consolidated B-24 Liberator and Avro Lancastrian aeroplanes there from Perth, Western Australia, on what was at the time the world's longest non-stop air route. The flight continued after the war with an intermediate re-fuelling stop at the Cocos Islands. ===Peak of civilian service=== Ratmalana airport at one time had the country's main air terminal, with the Douglas DC-3 Dakota and Lockheed Constellation aeroplanes of Air Ceylon flying out of it. In 1947, KLM flew Douglas DC-4 Skymasters through the airport on the route from the Netherlands to the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) In the 1950s, BOAC flew Canadair Argonauts (DC4 with Rolls Royce Merlin engines) from Ratmalana to London. On 11 August 1952, 3 months after the inaugural service of a passenger jet aircraft, BOAC began its Comet service between Colombo and London. Later (March 1962 - March 1971) Air Ceylon operated a Comet service on this route to London. The airport was also a Trans World Airlines (TWA) destination for a short time in the 1950s. ===Domestic-only era=== In 1964, the government decided to build the new Bandaranaike International Airport north of the city, to replace Ratmalana. The new airport was completed in 1967 and Ratmalana handed over all international services to the new airport. Ratmalana was left with the relatively small market for domestic air travel in the country. ===Return to international service=== In 2012, plans were drawn to relaunch Ratmalana as an international airport, to act as a secondary airport for the city. Ratmalana airport was declared open for small international commercial flights. The airport is available for commercial jet operations from August 2012. ==Expansion and upgrade== The airport is only 15 km south of the Colombo city centre compared to the larger Bandaranaike International Airport which is 32 km north of the city. The airport aims to attract private international flights and Low-cost airlines. Helitours, an airline operated by the Sri Lankan Airforce is based at the airport. There are a few industrial facilities such as the Bata shoe factory within a close proximity of the airport. The Government is developing the Ratmalana airport into an international city airport, which would provide services to private jets and small aircraft. In addition facilities at the Ampara, Batticaloa, Jaffna, and Koggala airports will be also upgraded. Repair to the runway and reconfiguration to the aerodrome for the use of corporate jet traffic would be done as a short-term development project of the Ratmalana airport. Improvements to the existing terminal building, repair to the runway, taxiway and apron, reconfiguration to the aerodrome for the use of corporate jet traffic would be done as a short- term development project of the Ratmalana airport. Under the medium-term of the Ratmalana airport development project: *Improvements to the existing terminal building *Control tower *Taxiway *Road network improvements *Navigational equipment installations *Constructing a terminal for civil movements and apron also implemented ===Current Facilities at the Airport=== Bell 412EP at Ratmalana Airport *Ground Handling *Immigration Service *Baggage and Passenger screening as per ICAO Standards *Quarantine *Re-fueling *VIP Lounge ==Terminals== There are currently 2 terminals at the airport. * Terminal 1: International Corporate Jets & Domestic * Terminal 2: International Regional Operations ==Airlines and destinations== All the following flights are currently suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic: ===Passenger flights=== ===Lodger Squadrons=== * No. 2 Heavy Transport Squadron * No. 8 Light Transport Squadron ==Accidents and incidents== ===1960s=== *On 15 November 1961, Vickers Viscount VT-DIH of Indian Airlines was damaged beyond economic repair when the co-pilot retracted the undercarriage during landing. ===1970s=== *On 7 September 1978, an Air Ceylon Hawker Siddeley HS 748 (registered 4R-ACJ) was destroyed in a fire while parked at Ratmalana Airport.

His first work in the cinema world was a dubber for Mario Monicelli's first movie, I ragazzi della Via Paal (1935). Subsequently, he worked for a radio, and in the meantime he started writing comic scripts. He also studied law, but without graduating. He spent the first four years of World War II in France, as a prisoner of the French Army first and, later, of the Wehrmacht. He managed to escape, however, and fought for a year with the US Army. Back from the front, he worked again in the radio and for wrote for theatre and humour magazine. In wrote his first screenplay for I due orfanelli, directed by Mario Mattoli. In 1949 started his famous collaboration with Furio Scarpelli, as the duo Age & Scarpelli. Together with Scarpelli, he worked on a total of 120 Italian movies. These include some of the most famous of all, such as Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Mario Monicelli's I soliti ignoti and many Totò movies. He also worked on some scripts on his own, such as that of Pietro Germi's Divorzio all'italiana. As an actor, he took part to La terrazza by Ettore Scola (screenplay by Age & Scarpelli, of course) and Ecce Bombo by Nanni Moretti.

These activities include loosening the soil, seeding, special watering, moving plants when they grow bigger, and harvesting, among others. The main steps for agricultural practices include preparation of soil, sowing, adding manure and fertilizers, irrigation, harvesting and storage. ==Seeding== The fundamental factor in the process of seeding is dependent on the properties of both seed and the soil it is being planted in. The prior step associated with seeding is crop selection, which mainly consists of two techniques: sexual and asexual. Asexual technique include all forms of vegetative process such as budding, grafting and layering. Sexual technique involves growing of the plant from a seed. Grafting is referred to as the artificial method of propagation in which parts of plants are joined together, in order to make them bind together and continue growing as one plant. Grafting is mainly applied to two parts of the plant: the dicot and the gymnosperms due to the presence of vascular cambium between the plant tissues: xylem and phloem. A grafted plant consists of two parts: first rootstock, which is the lower part of the plants that comprises roots and the lowest part of the shoot. Second the branches and primary stem, which consists of the upper and main part of the shoot which gradually develops into a fully nourished plant. Budding is another form of asexual reproduction in which new plant develops from a productive objective source of the parent plant. It is a method in which a bud of the plant is joined onto the stem of another plant.Ben G. Bareja (2011). Crop Agriculture Review. Retrieved from http://www.cropsreview.com/what-is-grafting.html The plant in which the bud is being implanted in, eventually develops into a replica of the parent plant. The new plant can either divert its ways into forming an independent plant, however in numerous cases the may remain attached and form various accumulations.Rowe, Jervis E. (2011). Crop Selection and Management. Retrieved from http://www.cardi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Crop-Selection-and- Management.pdfThe root nodules of the plant produce water ==Seedling== Germination is a process by which the seed develops into a seedling. The vital conditions necessary for this process are water, air, temperature, energy, viability and enzymes. If any of these conditions are absent, the process cannot undergo successfully. Germination is also known as sprouting; it is also considered as the first sign of life shown by a seed. ==Pollination== The process of pollination refers to the transfer of pollen to the female organs of the plant. Optimum factor for ideal pollination are: relative humidity rate of 50-70% and temperature of 24.4 degrees Celsius. If the humidity rate is higher than 90%, the pollen would not shed. Increasing air circulation is a favourable method of keeping humidity levels under control. ==Irrigation== Irrigation is the process of artificially applying water to soil to allow plant growth. This term is preferably used when large amounts of water is applied to dry, arid regions in order to facilitate plant growth. The process of irrigation not only increases the growth rate of the plant bust also increments the yield amount. In temperate and tropical areas rainfall and snowfall are the main suppliers of irrigation water, but in dry places with unfavourable weather conditions, groundwater serves as an essential source. Groundwater collects in basins made up of gravel and aquifers which are water- holding rocks. Dams also act as an essential distributive source of irrigation water. Underground wells also play an important role in storing water for irrigation, specifically in America and Arizona.Brown, Paul W. Importance of Irrigation Management. Retrieved from http://alfalfa.ucdavis.edu/+symposium/proceedings/2008/08-141.pdf Water and debris from streams filled by water accumulated during storms, also collects into underground basins. There are two types of irrigation techniques: spray irrigation and drip irrigation. Drip irrigation is regarded more efficient as less water evaporated as in spray irrigation.Science Channel.

Van Klaveren remains the only Dutch boxer to have won an Olympic gold medal. His younger brother Piet competed as a boxer at the 1952 Summer Olympics. ==Biography== Born in Rotterdam as Lambertus Steenhorst, he adopted the name of his stepfather Pieter van Klaveren when he was eight. After primary school, he worked as a butcher's assistant and fought in his spare time. He seriously took up boxing aged 16, and around that time changed to a vegetarian diet believing it fits better for a boxer. In 1926 he won the national flyweight title and in 1927–29 the featherweight title. After his Olympic success in 1928, he received a hero’s welcome in his hometown Rotterdam and was presented to the Dutch Queen and her prince consort. In 1929 van Klaveren began a long career of professional boxer, which ended in 1956. In 1931 he became European champion in the lightweight division and in 1938 he won the same title in the middleweight division. During his professional tenure, van Klaveren fought on four continents and won fights against Ceferino Garcia and Kid Azteca. He also faced Hall of Famers Young Corbett III and Billy Petrolle. In 1935 van Klaveren married Margarite Olivera, daughter of a banker. He lost much money through her excessive lifestyle and through his boxing manager. Van Klaveren was sentenced for one year for assaulting Olivera. He was released on bail after three months and fled to Rotterdam, leaving behind all his possessions. The statue of Bep van Klaveren in Rotterdam During World War II van Klaveren served overseas with the Dutch army. He then moved to Australia with his second wife, an Australian nurse, and worked there as a sports teacher, dock worker, bouncer, and boxing instructor. He then returned to Rotterdam and retired in 1948, but returned to the ring in 1954 and won 11 out of 12 bouts. He retired for good in 1956 after an unsuccessful attempt to win the European welterweight title. The same year he married for the third time, and for several years ran a cigar shop with his wife, though with little success. He continued to train through all his life and did not smoke or drink alcohol. He died in 1992 in his native Rotterdam, aged 84. The same year a memorial statue of van Klaveren was installed in Rotterdam. The annual Bep van Klaveren boxing memorial was launched in 1993, and became the largest boxing competition in the Netherlands. ==References== Category:1907 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Dutch male boxers Category:Olympic boxers of the Netherlands Category:Boxers at the 1928 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for the Netherlands Category:Sportspeople from Rotterdam Category:Olympic medalists in boxing Category:Featherweight boxers Category:Medalists at the 1928 Summer Olympics ","title":"Bep van Klaveren"},{"id":"3240172","text":"The Sihlsee (in English sometimes called Lake Sihl) is an artificial lake in the Swiss canton of Schwyz, near the town of Einsiedeln.

Place-Names of Northern Ireland Volume One. County Down I. Newry and South-West Down, p.126. The Northern Ireland Place-Name Project, Department of Celtic, The Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast. is a town in County Down, Northern Ireland. It is a hilltop Plantation of Ulster settlement between the Mourne Mountains, Slieve Croob and Banbridge. ==History== In older English documents, the village's name was usually spelt Rathfylan or Rathfrilan.Placenames Database of Ireland: Rathfriland/Ráth Fraoileann (see archival records) It was once the capital of the Magennis family, the Gaelic lords of Iveagh. They built a castle there in the late 16th century.Place Names NI The ruins (south gable 30 ft x 25 ft) may still be seen on the hill upon which Rathfriland sits. It was a square building of 3-4 storeys with a stone barrel vault at the ground floor to lessen the risk of fire. The castle was battered down during the Irish Confederate Wars and much of the remainder was carried off by William Hawkins of London, the first Protestant landowner there after the war. The stones were used to build the Town Inn (the building of which still stands on the corner of The Square and Newry Street) and other houses in the village. In 1760 the Market House, which dominates the main square, was built for the linen market by Miss Theodosia McGill. An old map of 1776 prepared for the Meade Estate shows streets, lanes, tenements and gardens forming the early village. A clock-faced war memorial stands in the square on the southeastern side. To this day, the names Meade, Maginess and Hawkins live on in Rathfriland, most notably in Iveagh Primary School where the three surnames are the name of the 'houses' or teams on sports day. The Dolly's Brae conflict took place between Rathfriland and the nearby town of Castlewellan on 12 July 1849. Up to 1,400 Orangemen marched from Rathfriland to Tollymore Park near Castlewellan, County Down. When 1,000 barely armed Ribbonmen gathered, rocks were thrown at the Orange parade. Catholic homes were burned and 80 Catholics killed. Rathfriland lies in County Down, the baronies of Iveagh Lower, Lower Half and Iveagh Upper, Upper Half, the townlands of Rossconor and Lessize, the district electoral area of Knockiveagh, and the civil parishes of Drumballyroney and Drumgath. ==Education== Education is provided by three schools: * Rathfriland High School * Iveagh Primary School, a coeducational primary school that educates around 350 pupils aged from 3 to 11. * St Mary's Primary School ==Transport== Rathfriland was served by Ballyroney railway station, only a few miles away. Goods and passengers were transported from the station to the village. The former GNR (I) line between Banbridge and Newcastle was shut down in 1955 by the UTA. ==Sport== Rathfriland Rangers F.C. play association football in the Northern Amateur Football League. Other sporting clubs include: * Rathfriland F.C. - formed in 1962. * Rathfriland Bowling Club - level green bowls. * Rathfriland Junior F.C. - formed in 2002. * Drumgath G.A.C. - Gaelic games. * Rathfriland Angling Club - game fishing On the Upper River Bann and Drumlough Lake. ==Demography== Rathfriland is classified as a village by the NI Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) but is described as a town by most residents.

Washington Street in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois. The first floor and basement were designed by John Root of the Burnham and Root architectural firm in 1890, with the rest of the building completed by Charles B. Atwood in 1895. It is the first skyscraper to have large plate glass windows make up the majority of its surface area, foreshadowing a design feature that would become dominant in the 20th century. The Reliance Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970; and on January 7, 1976, it was designated a National Historic Landmark.Reliance Building, NHL Database, National Historic Landmarks Program. Retrieved 10 February 2007. The Reliance Building is also part of the Loop Retail Historic District, a collection of over one hundred buildings that reflects the growth of State and Wabash Streets as the central retail district of Chicago. The building fell into disrepair starting in the 1940s, and was restored in the late 1990s. Since 1999, the building has housed the 122-room Staypineapple, An Iconic Hotel, The Loop (formerly the Hotel Burnham) and Atwood Cafe. ==History== Upper facade Commercial real estate in Chicago, Illinois boomed in the late 1870s due to the recovery from the Great Chicago Fire in 1871 and the Depression of 1873–79. In 1880, William Ellery Hale purchased a small lot in the Loop community area containing the four-story First National Bank Building, one of the few offices in downtown Chicago to partially survive the Great Fire. Hale was the founder of the Hale Elevator Company, an early producer of hydraulic elevators necessary in skyscraper design. Hale envisioned a new tower on the site, but first needed to raze the existing structure. However, its tenants did not want to terminate their leases. Instead, Hale lifted the second, third, and fourth floors on jackscrews and demolished the first.Pridmore 2003. p. 21 A new basement and ground floor, designed by John Wellborn Root of the Burnham & Root firm, were constructed in 1890. Hale had become acquainted with Burnham & Root through his other real estate projects, such as the Rookery Building.Pridmore 2003. p. 28 Burnham & Root were renowned in Chicago by this point, having already designed twenty other buildings in the Loop. Root developed the floating raft system, which enabled designers to build large, steel-frame buildings on a reinforced concrete foundation, a necessity in Chicago's moist soil. Root and Hale agreed that the new building needed to have large glass windows on the first floor with large, open spaces. On the upper floors, Hale intended to have several stories dedicated to smaller tenants, with offices for doctors and other professionals on the top floors. He also specifically emphasized the need for natural lighting on all floors.Pridmore 2003. p. 30 The plan for the Reliance Building was consistent with the growing concept of the Chicago school of architecture, which emphasized the importance of form following function. Root died of pneumonia on January 15, 1891, before the completion of his portion of the Reliance Building; his intended design for the rest of the building has never been found. Carson Pirie Scott & Co. was the first tenant of the Reliance Building, opening a dry goods store on the first floor once it was completed.Pridmore 2003. p. 34 Daniel Burnham recruited Boston architect Charles B. Atwood to complete the building with E. C. Shankland as lead engineer. After raising the original building's remaining three floors Atwood used white glazed architectural terra-cotta cladding, a feature that would later become strongly associated with him following his works for the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. At the time, it was believed that the recently developed enameled terra-cotta would never need to be cleaned because its smooth surface would allow any dirt to wash away in the rain.Pridmore 2003. p. 38 The steel framing on the top ten floors was completed over fifteen days, from July 16 to August 1, 1895. The Reliance Building, so named for its functionality, opened in March 1895. It was one of the first skyscrapers to offer electricity and phone service in all of its offices. In its first few decades, it provided office space for merchants and health professionals, including Al Capone's dentist. The building struggled during the Great Depression, and slowly declined. In October 1948, Karoll's Men's Shop opened a store on the lower two floors,Karoll's Men's Shop to Open Store In Loop, Chicago Daily Tribune, September 18, 1948, p. A5 with a modern façade that obliterated the original storefront. However, the upper floors remained hard to fill. On October 15, 1970, the Reliance Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places by the National Park Service. On January 7, 1976, it was recognized as a National Historic Landmark. The building continued to fall into disrepair, as the small size of its retail spaces were not appealing to business interests in the late 20th century. The city of Chicago made a commitment to revitalize the structure, but City Hall could not agree on a plan. The debate became particularly polarized after the 1989 demolition of the nearby McCarthy Building, which angered preservationists but satisfied business interests by providing space for a modern office building.Pridmore 2003. p. 45 Finally, in 1994, the McClier corporation collaborated with the Baldwin Development Company to restore the Reliance Building; these two groups had recently worked together to rehabilitate the Rookery Building. The City of Chicago purchased the property at this time for $1.3 million ($2 million in 2011 dollars). The Reliance Building's rehabilitation was completed in 1999 at a cost of $27.5 million ($36.7 million in 2011 dollars) as the former retail space was converted into a luxury hotel. Canal Street Partners, LLC bought the revitalized space and created the Hotel Burnham.Pridmore 2003. p. 54 The preservation of this building was championed by the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley was presented with a National Trust for Historic Preservation Honor Award in 2001 for the role of the city in preserving the structure. In December 2016, Pineapple Hospitality purchased the building and renamed the hotel as first The Alise Chicago,https://www.hotelmanagement.net/transactions/chicago-s-hotel-burnham- sold-renamed then later Staypineapple, An Iconic Hotel, The Loop. ==Architecture== A hallway of the Reliance Building following the 1999 restorationThe addition of the remaining floors in 1894-1895 completed the building and marked the \\"first comprehensive achievement\\"Kenneth Frampton and Yukio Futagawa Modern Architecture 1851-1945 p. 63 of the Chicago construction method. The building's plate-glass windows are set within the terra-cotta- tiled facade. Its steel-frame superstructure is built atop concrete caissons sunk as much as 125 feet beneath the footing. The Reliance Building has been called \\"proto-Modernist\\" in its lack of the hierarchy found in Classical facades. Its stacks of projecting bay windows and terra-cotta cladding create an effect of extraordinary lightness.Colquhoun, Alan (2002). Modern Architecture, pp. 38-39. Oxford University Press. .

It was founded in 1995 by Peter Wright, who had the idea of writing a small newsletter to the then only 15-strong radio astronomy community in Europe, which were up to this date linked only by letters. Today E.R.A.C. has over 350 members in 19 different countries with a proportional membership of professionals and amateurs. The European Radio Astronomy Club has its headquarters in Mannheim, Germany. The aim of the club to unite Europeans with a common interest in Radio Science. The main tool to do this is still a printed newsletter which goes out to all members. E.R.A.C. regularly holds an International Congress for Radio Astronomy which is attended by scientists from all over the world. Meeting in 1997, 2000, and 2003 were held at the Starkenburg Observatory in Heppenheim, before moving to the SRH University of Applied Science in Heidelberg in 2006. In 1997, the director of the British Jodrell Bank Observatory met for the first time, the executive director of the SETI League.The SETI League, Inc. The result of this meeting was that SETI research was done for the very first time at Jodrell bank. Institutes in Europe are thought to frown on amateurs with their backyard telescopes. This is in contrast with the situation in the United States; there, where amateurs had played such an important role in the birth of this new science, amateurs were tightly interwoven in all US radio astronomy work. ==The 21 cm Hydrogen Line== In 1995, E.R.A.C. introduced the UEK21 converter design which allowed anyone to have an inexpensive unit able to detect the hydrogen line. Together with a shortwave receiver to get the needed IF gain and frequency selection and a homemade parabolic antenna, it is possible for, say, a Young Scientist of the Year Project to build a radio telescope. Very soon, this unit was used in Europe also for SETI research as well for Project Argus from the SETI League. Listening to Jupiter with the shortwave receiver needed for 21 cm, it is also possible to remove the UEK21 converter and use only the shortwave receiver connected to a simple dipole. If the frequency selected is above 18 MHz, it is possible when conditions are right to listen through the ionosphere. At lower frequencies, the ionosphere is opaque. Here, two targets are possible: the Sun with its solar flares or Jupiter, which is also a very strong radio source, together with the moon Io, which is a very powerful natural radio wave transmitter. When Jupiter, Io and the Earth are aligned, it is possible to hear this radio source very clearly. ==References== ==External links== *[ERAC official website - http://www.eracnet.org ] Category:Astronomy in Europe Category:Radio astronomy ","title":"The European Radio Astronomy Club"},{"id":"3240395","text":"Karel Leendert Miljon (17 September 1903, Amsterdam - 8 February 1984, Bennebroek) was a Dutch boxer, who won the bronze medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam.

Murata Manufacturing first developed transparent polycrystalline ceramics in February 2001. This polycrystalline ceramic is a type of dielectric resonator material commonly used in microwaves and millimeter waves. While offering superior electrical properties, high levels of transmissivity, and refractive index, it also has good optical characteristics without birefringence. Normally, ceramics are opaque because pores are formed at triple points where grains intersect, causing scattering of incident light. Murata has optimized the entire development process of making dense and homogenous ceramics to improve their performance. Under recommendations from Casio, the material itself has been refined for use in digital camera optical lenses by endowing it with improved transmission of short wavelength light and by reducing pores inside ceramics that reduce transparency. Lumicera has the same light transmitting qualities as optical glass commonly used in today's conventional camera lenses, however it has refractive index (nd = 2.08 at 587 nm) much greater than that of optical glass (nd = 1.5 – 1.85 ) and offers superior strength. The Lumicera Z variant is described as barium oxide based material, not containing any environmentally hazardous materials (e.g. lead). Lumicera is transparent up to 10 micrometers, making it useful for instruments operating in mid-infrared spectrum. Lumicera is a trademark of Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd.

He is known for his landmark Vizcaya estate, where he was an early 20th-century resident on Biscayne Bay in the present day Coconut Grove district of Miami, Florida. Begun in 1910, with architecture and gardens in a Mediterranean Revival style, Vizcaya was his passionate endeavor with artist Paul Chalfin, and his winter home from 1916 to his death in 1925.Griswold, Mac and Weller, Eleanor. \\"The Golden Age of American Gardens, proud owners-private estates 1890 - 1940\\". Harry N. Abrams. N.Y. 1991. . pp. 174–76 ==Early life== James Deering was born in 1859 in the western Maine town of South Paris. He was the son of William Deering and his second wife, Clara Hammond Deering. His older half-brother was the arts patron Charles Deering. His father, who had inherited the family woolen mill and was landowner in the Northeast, invested in a farm-equipment manufacturing company, renaming it the Deering Harvester Company. In 1873, he moved the family to Chicago, Illinois. New 'Deering Harvester Company' reaper machinery enabled Midwestern United States farmers to harvest an acre of grain per hour, a substantial increase in productivity that increased the profitability of Midwest agriculture significantly. The Deering Harvester Company grew in value, so that by the end of the 19th century, the Deerings had become one of America's wealthiest families, although his father William was conservative in family spending. His parents did acquire a residence in St. Augustine, Florida, for the winter season. James Deering's older brother Charles joined the family business in the 1880s, after attending the United States Naval Academy and nine years in the Navy. James Deering attended one year each at Northwestern University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before also joining the company at the same time. ==Career== James joined the Deering Harvester Company in 1880 as treasurer. In 1902, with the Bank of J.P. Morgan purchasing Deering Harvester Company and McCormick Reaper Company, a resulting merger formed the International Harvester corporation and the largest producer of agricultural machinery in the nation. James Deering became vice-president of the new corporation, responsible for the three Illinois manufacturing plants. In 1909, he was phased out of daily company affairs by J.P. Morgan interests. By the turn of the century, James Deering owned homes on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, in the countryside near Evanston, Illinois, in New York City, and in Paris, France. His name appeared in social columns as an arts connoisseur, socialite, international traveler, and cultural ambassador. He hosted events for French dignitaries at his New York and Chicago residences. In 1906, for Deering's work in promoting agricultural technology development in France, he was awarded the Légion d'honneur (\\"National Order of the Legion of Honour\\"). He retired from the vice- presidency of International Harvester, with his health weakening due to pernicious anemia, so in 1910, Deering purchased land in Coconut Grove, south of Miami and north of his brother's Charles Deering Estate. James Deering and Paul Chalfin then partnered to travel and create 'Vizcaya' there.Griswold, Mac and Weller, Eleanor. \\"The Golden Age of American Gardens, proud owners-private estates 1890 - 1940\\". Harry N. Abrams. N.Y. 1991. . p. 174 James Deering never married. =='Vizcaya'== Villa Vizcaya Garden fresco Grotto seating Storm clouds James Deering built Villa Vizcaya between 1914 and 1922 with visionary mastermind of the project, designer Paul Chalfin, his collaborator companion. The architect was F. Burrall Hoffman Jr.. The estate's landscape master plan and formal gardens were designed by Colombian landscape designer Diego Suarez. Paul Chalfin had attended Harvard, trained as a painter at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and was an associate of renowned decorator Elsie de Wolfe. She introduced Chalfin to Deering for the interiors of his Chicago home in 1910. In 1910, Chalfin and Deering traveled through Europe together for the first trip of many over the years, in part to collect ideas and begin acquiring art, antiquities, and furnishings for the new Florida estate. The culmination of their shared effort and lasting memorial to their creative relationship is Villa Vizcaya, the Miami estate created between 1914 and 1923. accessed 4/11/2010 The Villa Vizcaya is distinguished for its Italian Renaissance-inspired Mediterranean Revival architecture, its huge Italian Renaissance revival gardens, and sumptuously designed, detailed, and executed interior architectural elements with European, Asian, and American furnishings, and art and antiquities that span two millennia. The numerous sculptures in the gardens and villa are of ancient Greek, Greco-Roman, and Italian Renaissance origins and styles. For example, one element is altar-like in white marble, featuring the carved heads of goats, cattle, and lions, and flanked by coral stone pillars with carving of the 'Oak Tree of Gernika', symbolizing the freedom of the Basque Vizcaya in Spain. The gardens are notable for introducing classical Italian and French design aesthetics into a subtropical habitat's plant palette and context — a new approach. This resulted in ongoing garden experiments with many tropical plants new to American horticulture. While Vizcaya's landscape design style evokes other periods and places, the use of native stone, plants, and light modulation reflected Deering's desire to showcase the indigenous natural beauty. By 1922, the estate included large lagoons and new islands down-coast south of the villa and its formal gardens. On the estate's western acreage, across present day South Miami Avenue, were the produce gardens and grazing fields. A village compound was designed and built to the west, also. These endeavors were done with the intent of making Vizcaya primarily self-sufficient, modeled on European estates to compensate for the limited commodities and services of early 1920s Miami. The village buildings housed the property's staff quarters, auto garages, equipment sheds, workshops, and barns for the domesticated animals. Deering spent winters there beginning on Christmas Day 1916 when the residence was sufficiently complete and he arrived aboard his new yacht Nepenthe. He immediately engaged in the Miami regatta season having had entered earlier from Paris by letter his 44 foot (13.4 m) powerboat Psyche in all events for which the boat qualified in the January 1917 regatta. Among James Deering's closest friends were painter Gari Melchers and his wife Corinne. Through his brother Charles, also a patron of the arts and collector, he had friendships with the painters John Singer Sargent and Anders Zorn. Sargent visited Vizcaya in March 1917 and produced a series of watercolors of the estate, as well as portrait of James. After the extensive gardens were completed in 1923, Deering's health began to weaken. Nonetheless, he traveled and entertained guests, including the silent film stars Lillian Gish and Marion Davies. Deering was described in his later years as \\"a reticent man with impeccably proper manners, leavened by a sense of humor.\\" He was not unlike a 'Jay Gatsby' figure of the 'Roaring Twenties' era. In 1923, he opened the gardens to the public on Sundays, and Deering reportedly watched the visitors from his balcony, curious about who came, but not wanting to be recognized for his hospitality. In this period's personal letters, he expressed the hope that his nieces and nephews would enjoy coming to Vizcaya, so tennis courts, a bowling alley, a billiard room, and a swimming pool were part of the estate to encourage their visits. ==Death and legacy== James Deering died in September 1925, on board the steamship SS City of Paris en route back to the United States. The philanthropic beneficiaries of his estate were Wesley Hospital, founded by his father in Chicago; the Visiting Nurse Association; the Children's Hospital of Chicago; and the Art Institute of Chicago, which received several significant paintings: the Édouard Manet \\"Mocking of Christ\\" and three by Italian master Giambattista Tiepolo of Rinaldo and Armida based on scenes from the 16th-century epic Gerusalemme Liberata by Torquato Tasso. Following the death of James Deering, Villa Vizcaya passed to his two nieces, Marion Deering McCormick and Barbara Deering Danielson. Over the decades, after hurricanes and rising maintenance costs, they began selling the estate's surrounding land parcels. In 1952, at a below- market price, they sold the villa and formal gardens, and in 1955 the village 'core estate' to Miami-Dade County for a museum and gardens to be open to the public. With the initial sale, they donated the antiquities and furnishings to the County Museum. ===Museum and gardens=== Unlike many other historic house museums, Vizcaya contains the original antiques and furnishings, giving continuity to experience Deering's era. His brother Charles Deering's nearby estate, now named 'The Deering Estate at Cutler', is also open to the public and owned by Miami-Dade County, but without art and furnishings. James Deering's estate, now named Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, is an accredited museum and National Historic Landmark. The villa, gardens, and village are under ongoing restoration. The Vizcaya Museum and Gardens mission is \\"to preserve Vizcaya to engage our community and its visitors in learning through the arts, history, and the environment.\\" ==References== ===Reference books=== * Witold Rybczynski and Laurie Olin, authors, Steven Brooke, photographer.

The concept of a distance is valid only if all elements of the object are of the same size (typically given in bytes or words). For example, in \`A\` as an array of characters containing \`\\"abcdef\\"\`, the fourth element containing the character \`'d'\` has an offset of three from the start of \`A\`. == In assembly language == In computer engineering and low-level programming (such as assembly language), an offset usually denotes the number of address locations added to a base address in order to get to a specific absolute address. In this (original) meaning of offset, only the basic address unit, usually the 8-bit byte, is used to specify the offset's size. In this context an offset is sometimes called a relative address. In IBM System/360 instructions, a 12-bit offset embedded within certain instructions provided a range of between 0 and 4096 bytes. For example, within an unconditional branch instruction (X'47F0Fxxx'), the xxx 12bit hexadecimal offset provided the byte offset from the base register (15) to branch to. An odd offset would cause a program check (unless the base register itself also contained an odd address)—since instructions had to be aligned on half-word boundaries to execute without a program or hardware interrupt. The previous example describes an indirect way to address to a memory location in the format of segment:offset. For example, assume we want to refer to memory location 0xF867. One way this can be accomplished is by first defining a segment with beginning address 0xF000, and then defining an offset of 0x0867. Further, we are also allowed to shift the hexadecimal segment to reach the final absolute memory address. One thing to note here is that we can reach our final absolute address in many ways.

The Niementowski quinoline synthesis ==Overview== In 1894, Niementowski reported that 2-phenyl-4-hydroxyquinoline was formed when anthranilic acid and acetophenone were heated to 120–130 °C. He later found that at higher heat, 200 °C, anthranilic acid and heptaldehyde formed minimal yields of 4-hydroxy-3-pentaquinoline.Hartz, pp. 376–384 Several reviews have been published. ==Variations== The temperatures required for this reaction make it less popular than other quinoline synthetic procedures. However, variations have been proposed to make this a more pragmatic and useful reaction. Adding phorphorous oxychloride to the reaction mixture to mediate a condensation to make both isomers of an important precursor to an important α1-adrenoreceptor antagonist. When the 3 position of an arylketone is substituted, it has been shown that a Niementowski-type reaction with propionic acid can produce a 4-hydroxyquinoline with 2-thiomethyl substitute. The method has also been altered to occur with a catalytic amount of base, or in the presence of polyphosphoric acid. ==Mechanism== Because of the similarity of these to the reagents in the Friedlander quinolone synthesis, a benzaldehyde with an aldehyde or ketone, the Niementowski quinoline synthesis mechanism is minimally different from that of the Friedländer synthesis. While studied in depth, two reaction pathways are possible and both have significant support. The reaction is thought to begin with the formation of a Schiff base, and then proceed via an intra-molecular condensation to make an imine intermediate (see below). There is then a loss of water that leads to a ring closing and formation of the quinoline derivative. Most evidence supports this as the mechanism in normal conditions of 120–130 °C. Alternatively, the reaction begins with an intermolecular condensation and subsequent formation of the imine intermediate. The latter has been shown to be more common under acidic or basic conditions. A similar pathway has been proposed for the Niementowski quinazoline synthesis.Hartz, pp. 440–453 A possible mechanism of the Niementowski quinoline synthesis. ==References== ==Bibliography== *Hartz, R.

Truran began making up games as mathematical teaching aids. At one time his entire mathematics course for 9-13 year olds was based on games, puzzles and story situations. Early games were published in Games & Puzzles Magazine and he became Puzzles Editor of that magazine and later of Top Puzzles. For over 13 years he wrote for Computer Talk magazine and included many new games and puzzles as well as early articles on the Rubik's Cube. A nine-part puzzle Treasure Trail appeared in the Sunday Telegraph and he freelanced for many magazines and newspapers before taking up puzzling full- time in 1985 with the publishers now called Puzzler Media Ltd. In that time he has created and edited a wide variety of magazines from Wordsearch to mathematical but has largely concentrated on logical puzzling, providing much of the content to magazines such as Logical Puzzles. He is the inventor of the logical puzzle now known as Mosaic (1980s) which was developed by Conceptis Ltd. and which had its first success on Japanese telephones. He is credited by some as a possible founder or early creator of what might be called cross- referencing or row-and-column puzzles, where numbers outside a grid give information as to what to put inside the grid. An early example is Whittleword (1979) which was followed by Domino Deal, Ace in Place and others. He is currently a Managing Editor at Puzzler Media Ltd. and edits Sudoku and Kakuro magazines as well as Hanjie, Hashi, Super Hanjie, Mosaic, Enigma and Colour Hanjie. He also contributes to other magazines such as Tough Puzzles and has created the \\"Squiffy Sudokus\\" for a Carol Vorderman book. A chance meeting with Bernard Pearson led to an involvement with Terry Pratchett's Discworld fantasy setting, and the game Thud was the first result. Following successful sales over three years, the new edition includes a faster, shorter game, Koom Valley Thud, which reflects incidents in the novel Thud!.

It is the Atlantic coast running northeast from Halifax Harbour to the eastern end of the peninsula at the Strait of Canso. The Eastern Shore is a scenic, yet sparsely settled area, hosting dozens of small fishing harbours and communities; in recent decades the region has become home to a growing number of cottages and recreational properties, given the amount of unspoiled sand beaches and dramatic coastlines. The shore also hosts the majority of Nova Scotia's small islands. The tourism industry is concentrated near popular beaches and provincial parks such as Lawrencetown, Clam Harbour, and Martinique, as well as the centrally-located service communities of Musquodoboit Harbour, Sheet Harbour, Sherbrooke, Canso, Guysborough and Mulgrave. Popular tourist attractions include the Liscombe Lodge resort and conference centre in Liscomb Mills and the Historic Sherbrooke Village in Sherbrooke. The Battle at Jeddore (1722) is one of the many historic events to occur along the shore. Politically, the Eastern Shore is part of three federal ridings: Cape Breton—Canso in Guysborough, Central Nova in the eastern areas Halifax Regional Municipality, and Sackville—Preston—Chezzetcook at the western end. The provincial ridings include Eastern Shore, Guysborough-Sheet Harbour, as well as several ridings in the eastern part of HRM's urban core (south and east of Dartmouth). In the Halifax Regional Municipality, the Eastern Shore is represented on the Halifax Regional Council as District 1 Eastern Shore - Musquodoboit Valley and District 3 Preston - Lawrencetown - Chezzetcook. ==Population== The area between Dartmouth and Cape Breton is sparsely populated. The decline in the fishing industry has meant an outflow of people to larger urban areas and to other fishing villages in the province. Guysborough and Canso, with populations of 922 and 820 respectively, are the largest communities. There are more than 300 communities along the Eastern Shore, which vary in size. ==History== The Eastern Shore is home to numerous historic gold mining areas near Port Dufferin, Tangier, Sherbrooke, and Goldboro, as well as Nova Scotia's most historic seaport, Canso. Canso predates Halifax, Lunenburg and Annapolis Royal as one of North America's earliest settlements. At Sherbrooke, the St. Mary's River empties into the Atlantic and is one of the province's famed Atlantic Salmon runs. Numerous lumber mills operated here during the early 1900s as Nova Scotia entered the 'industrial revolution'. A railway had been proposed during the 1880s to run east from Dartmouth, however the sparse settlement and lack of industrial economic activity saw the railway line swing north up the Musquodoboit River at Musquodoboit Harbour to access the fertile agricultural district of the Musquodoboit Valley. Another railway project was proposed to run between Pictou and the village of Guysborough and on to Canso during 'the age of sail', when Canso rivalled Halifax as the most important first port of call in Nova Scotia for westbound trans-Atlantic vessels, as Canso was roughly the same distance by rail from the New Brunswick–Nova Scotia border as Halifax. A rail line was eventually graded and bridges constructed between Pictou and Guysborough during the 1930s, however, tracks were never laid and the project was abandoned, leaving most of the Eastern Shore without rail service. During the post-World War II period, the provincial government upgraded local roads, resulting in the present alignment of Trunk 7. During the 1980s-90s, when the rail line was abandoned, the controlled-access Nova Scotia Highway 107 was built from the Burnside Industrial Park in Dartmouth to Musquodoboit Harbour, to assist commuters and truck traffic travelling to rural HRM and to Hwy. 102 via Hwy. 118. A 1990s regional development project saw the port of Sheet Harbour redeveloped into an important regional deep-water port. The facility is most heavily used during the winter months, when the Northumberland Strait port of Pictou is iced in and industrial shippers from Pictou County truck shipments to Sheet Harbour. A large wharf, sawmill and industrial greenhouse operation are also located on site. Beaver Harbour was home to a trans- Atlantic cable station which was operated by Teleglobe, but is now decommissioned. ==Geography== A map of east and west Eastern Shore planning areas in Halifax, Nova Scotia Most of the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia consists of sandstone and shale bedrock, forming rolling hills, which are up to in elevation and many offshore islands, of which two of the largest are Wolfes Island and Barren Island.https://novascotia.ca/natr/meb/download/mg/map/htm/map_2000-001.asp The Eastern Shore is heavily forested. Approximately inland from the coast is the Eastern Shore Granite Ridge. This is an expansive area of 350-million-year-old granite bedrock. ===Water bodies=== Several major rivers flow into the coast along the Eastern Shore, including the Musquodoboit River, which flows into the Musquodoboit Harbour, Jeddore Harbour, Tangier River, which flows from Tangier Grand Lake to the Atlantic, West River Sheet Harbour, which flows into the Northwest Arm of Sheet Harbour, as well as East River Sheet Harbour into the Northeast Arm. The St. Mary's River also flows into the Atlantic, passing through the community of Sherbrooke. There are many lakes, ponds, flowages and other types of freshwater bodies along the Eastern Shore. The largest of which are Porters Lake, which flows almost directly into the Atlantic Ocean, Lake Charlotte, which flows into Ship Harbour via the Ship Harbour River and Tangier Grand Lake, which flows into the Atlantic Ocean via the Tangier River. The largest water formation by far is the Chedabucto Bay, at the eastern end of the Eastern Shore. There also numerous, albeit much smaller, bays, harbours and other coastal features along the Eastern Shore, including but not limited to: Musquodoboit Harbour, Jeddore Harbour, Ship Harbour, Sheet Harbour, Country Harbour, Tor Bay and Guysborough Harbour. ==Economy and amenities== Most of the economy along the Eastern Shore is based around fishing, forestry and tourism. There is an industrial port in Sheet Harbour as well. ===Tourism=== Tourism is becoming an increasingly active industry along the Eastern Shore. Duncan MacMillan High School Sherbrooke Village There is a Fisherman's Life Museum in Jeddore Oyster Ponds. There is trout fishing and Atlantic salmon serves as a sport in rivers along the coast. In Eastern Passage, there is a Fishermen's Cove tourist attraction with a few stores. There is an interactive museum located in Sherbrooke, Nova Scotia. It is called the Historic Sherbrooke Village and it depicts life around the 1900s in the village. The longest beaches on the Eastern Shore are Lawrencetown Beach, in Lawrencetown, Martinique Beach, near Musquodoboit Harbour and Taylor Head Beach, located in Spry Bay, within the boundaries of Taylor Head Provincial Park. ===Schools=== There are nine schools along the Eastern Shore. Most are located in the larger communities. These schools are: Porters Lake Elementary and O'Connell Drive Elementary School, both in Porter's Lake, Gaetz Brook Junior High School, in Gaetz Brook, Eastern Shore District High School (ESDH), in Musquodoboit Harbour, Oyster Pond Academy (OPA), in Jeddore Oyster Ponds Lakefront Consolidated School (LCS), in Tangier, Duncan MacMillan High School (DMHS) and Sheet Harbour Consolidated School (SHCS), both in Sheet Harbour and Saint Mary's Education Centre/Academy (SMECA), in Sherbrooke. A new school in Sheet Harbour is currently being built in the former site of Duncan MacMillan High School and Sheet Harbour Consolidated School. It is a merge of the schools Duncan MacMillan High School, Sheet Harbour Consolidated School, Lakefront Consolidated Elementary and Eastern Consolidated School.There is a possibility that both schools in Sheet Harbour, as well as Lakefront Consolidated School in Tangier, will be closed and merged into one P-12 school in the next few years. ==Gallery== Dartmouth Waterfront 2007.jpgDartmouth, Nova Scotia East Lawerencetown.JPGLawrencetown West Chezzetcook.jpgWest Chezzetcook MusqHbrStn 2010.jpgMusquodoboit Harbour Eastern Shore.jpgJeddore Oyster Ponds Seaside festival 058.JPGSheet Harbour Tangier NS PO 2013.jpgTangier MoserRiver PO 2013.jpgMoser River Ecum Secum.jpgEcum Secum SherbrookeNovaScotiaPO.jpgSherbrooke Canso11.jpgCanso Guysborough1.jpgGuysborough Mulgrave NS PO.jpgMulgrave == References == Category:Geography of Nova Scotia Category:Geography of Halifax, Nova Scotia Category:Geography of Guysborough County, Nova Scotia Category:Geographic regions of Nova Scotia ","title":"Eastern Shore (Nova Scotia)"},{"id":"3240465","text":"Britta Bilač (née Vörös) (born December 4, 1968, in Saalfeld, Thuringia, East Germany) is a retired high jumper who competed internationally for Germany and Slovenia from 1992 onwards.

Wilson is an American business executive. He served as chairman of the board of Northwest Airlines, chief financial officer of Walt Disney Company and chief financial officer of Marriott Corporation. ==Early life== Wilson was born and raised in Alliance, Ohio. He graduated from Alliance High School 1958. Wilson attended Duke University where he played basketball and football. Wilson was a running back on the Duke football team for two championship years. Wilson earned a bachelor's degree from Trinity college at Duke University in 1962, an MBA from the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania in 1963. He received an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Pepperdine University in 2005. His eldest son Derek Wilson earned a bachelor of arts degree in economics from Duke in 1986 and an MBA from The Fuqua School of Business in 1990. Derek's mother, Susan Moody Wilson, graduated from the Woman's College at Duke in 1962. Derek's daughter, Trinity, is also a Duke graduate. ==Career== Wilson began his career in 1964 in Manila as CFO of Trans-Philippines Investment Corp. (TPIC), a leveraged buyout of one of the world's largest sugar companies. He created and was CEO of a sugar- trading subsidiary that produced 20 percent of TPIC's profit with no capital invested. He recommended and implemented the transformation of the firm from a sugar company to one of Asia's largest construction companies by acquiring Atlantic Gulf & Pacific (AG&P;) in 1969, while selling the sugar mills. After returning from Asia, he joined Marriott in 1974, as executive vice president for finance, strategy and development. While there, Marriott's market capitalization increased from $200 million in 1974 to $3.6 billion in 1987 for a 24 percent IRR. Among his accomplishments were creating and developing the Courtyard Hotel concept, as well as Marriott time sharing. He led the 1978 repurchase of one-third of Marriott shares, which at the time was the second largest stock buyback in history. In 1985, Wilson joined the Walt Disney Company as executive vice president of finance, strategy and development when the Bass Brothers acquired control. During his time there, market capitalization increased from $2 billion to $20 billion, an IRR of 58 percent, primarily by expanding hotel and theme park assets while increasing prices. Among his accomplishments were increasing hotel rooms from 4,000 in 1985 to 18,000 rooms in 1992 and introducing time-sharing based on the Marriott model. He developed the Euro Disney theme park complex in Paris from site selection to financing, gaining major concessions from the French government and culminating in one of Europe's largest IPOs. He financed films through innovative public partnerships that shifted ownership risk to investors while Disney retained distribution fees and a share of appreciation. Wilson led the buyout of Northwest Airlines in 1989. In 1997, as chairman of Northwest, he acquired control of Continental Airlines. Prior to the September 11 attacks and the subsequent fallout on the airline industry, Northwest's market capitalization reached $6 billion, providing investors with handsome returns on their $300 million initial equity investment. He served as chairman or co- chairman of Northwest from 1991 to 2007. Wilson successfully acquired other companies, including Progress Rail in 2004, and is the creator and general partner of several private equity funds: Manhattan Pacific Partners, an investment fund; Thayer Lodging, a hotel investor; and KAILAI Investments, which invests in American and Chinese companies. “Leadership and management are a business’s most important asset.

In the first non-racial elections held in South Africa in 1994, the party contested both parliamentary and provincial elections. It won 19,451 votes in the parliamentary elections (0.1% of nationwide vote) and 21,877 votes in the provincial elections in the Free State, failing to win seats in either. After not standing in the 1999 elections, the party entered into an electoral pact with the Pan-Africanist Congress for the 2004 elections, after renouncing their pact with the Democratic Alliance. DPSA candidates contested on the PAC parliamentary lists. DPSA did, however, contest the provincial elections in the Free State, where it got 9,806 votes (0.97% of the votes in that province), again failing to win a seat. In the municipality of Maluti a Phofung (formerly the QwaQwa state) the party got 8,493 votes (6.7%). The party also has some small base of support in the central parts of the Free State and is the largest opposition party in the Maluti a Phofung council. In the 2009 elections, the party again contested only the Free State provincial election, failing to win a seat. The party won a by-election in QwaQwa in December 2011, earning it its only current ward seat. Today the party is led by Moeketsi Lebesa. ==References== Category:Political parties in South Africa Category:Political parties established in 1975 Category:QwaQwa ","title":"Dikwankwetla Party of South Africa"},{"id":"3240505","text":"Come Out is a 1966 piece by American composer Steve Reich. Reich was asked to edit down tape footage into a form of collage for a benefit for the Harlem Six and Come Out was a byproduct of the collage's production.Robert Adlington - Oxford University Press The Harlem Six were six black youths arrested for a murder of Margit Sugar, a Hungarian refugee, in Harlem in the weeks following the Little Fruit Stand Riot of 1964. Only one of the six was responsible while the lead witness is generally considered the actual perpetrator. Truman Nelson, a civil rights activist and New Yorker who had asked Reich to compose a sound collage that was separate from Come Out, gave him a collection of tapes with recorded voices to use as source material. Nelson agreed to give Reich creative freedom with the tapes that he presented him for the sound collage. Come Out was a loop of four seconds from the more than 70 hours of tapes Nelson presented to Reich. == Analysis == Reich eventually used the voice of Daniel Hamm, one of the boys involved in the riots but not responsible for the murder; he was nineteen at the time of the recording. At the beginning of the piece, he says, \\"I had to, like, open the bruise up, and let some of the bruise blood come out to show them\\" (alluding to how Hamm had punctured a bruise on his own body to convince police that he had been beaten while in jail). The police had not previously dealt with Hamm's injuries since he did not appear seriously wounded and they had beaten him themselves. This marks the first time that a member of the Five-Percent Nation appeared on a recording. The full statement is repeated once. Reich re-recorded the fragment \\"come out to show them\\" on two channels, which initially play in unison. They quickly slip out of sync to produce a phase shifting effect, characteristic of Reich's early works. Gradually, the discrepancy widens and becomes a reverberation and, later, almost a canon. The two voices then split into four, looped continuously, then eight, until the actual words are unintelligible. The listener is left with only the rhythmic and tonal patterns of the spoken words. Reich says in the liner notes of his album Early Works of using recorded speech as source material that \\"by not altering its pitch or timbre, one keeps the original emotional power that speech has while intensifying its melody and meaning through repetition and rhythm.\\" The piece is a prime example of process music. In dance, the piece was used in 1982 by the Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker as part of one of her seminal works, Fase, which became a cornerstone of contemporary dance. == References in other recordings == * Captain Beefheart's song \\"Moonlight on Vermont,\\" from Trout Mask Replica (1969) included the phrase \\"come out to show them\\" repeated several times.

At its heart was an anthology of short stories, Higher Ground (ed Anuj Goyal), written by sixteen best-selling children's authors, including Michael Morpurgo, Steve Voake and Eoin Colfer, and based on children who survived the tsunami. There was also an audiobook version of the anthology, with dramatised readings of these stories by Val Kilmer, James Nesbitt, Meera Syal, Sean Bean, Stephen Fry and Dawn French, amongst others, with music by Nitin Sawhney. The Project was organised in aid of UNICEF, Save the Children, Handicap International, Y Care International and SOS Children. Online educational resources were also built for teachers in schools and colleges. Soft-launched at the Cheltenham Festival, the Project was more later formally launched at the Woburn Gallery in London. Published by Chrysalis Children's Books, the book and CD sold out of its first print-run within the first month of publication, leading to a second run.

In , Dyer's first season at the helm of the Cardinals, the Redbirds defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers in a thrilling National League season that featured the first postseason playoff in baseball history, then bested the favored Boston Red Sox in a seven-game World Series. ==Early life, college career== Edwin Hawley Dyer was born October 11, 1899, in Morgan City, Louisiana, the fourth of seven children of Joseph M. and Alice Natalie Dyer. Baseball encyclopedias give his birth date as 1900, but his son Eddie Jr. says he subtracted a year from his age when he entered professional ball. U.S. census and military draft records confirm this.http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/b3e94581 He was an outstanding football, baseball and track and field athlete as part of the Morgan City High School, Class of 1917. Eddie Dyer, Rice Institute (1921) His father owned a general store and a lumber yard and served as mayor of Morgan City, but lost it all during a recession before World War I and moved his family to Houston, Texas where an oil boom was just beginning. Dyer earned an athletic scholarship to Rice Institute and lettered in three sports (football, baseball, track), winning the Southwest Conference championship in the broad jump and earning a berth on the All-SWC football team in 1920. He was the Owl's football captain in 1921. He was also All-SWC in each of his three years of varsity baseball (1919, 1920, 1921). He pitched a no-hitter against Baylor's Ted Lyons, later a Hall of Fame pitcher for the White Sox. Dyer left school two credits short of graduation in 1922 when Branch Rickey gave him a $2,500 bonus to sign with the Cardinals. The money paid off his father's debts and put his youngest brother, Sammy, through one year of college. In 1936, Dyer completed requirements for his bachelor's degree from Rice. ==Playing career with St. Louis Cardinals== The , Dyer was a versatile player, playing outfield and first base in addition to pitching. He made his debut with the Cardinals on the mound on July 8, 1922 and pitched twice in relief before he was farmed out to Syracuse, at the highest minor-league level. The next spring Rickey sent him to Houston, then to Wichita Falls, both in the Texas League, to play the outfield. When he didn't hit, he became a full-time pitcher. On September 9, 1923, in Dyer's first start as pitcher, he pitched a complete game shutout of the Chicago Cubs, winning 3-0. In 1924 he stuck with the Cardinals, but posted a 4.61 ERA and an 8-11 record, dividing his time between starting and relieving for the sixth-place club. The next year he lowered his ERA to 4.15, pitching primarily in relief. Rickey moved into the front office and the Cardinals' star second baseman, Rogers Hornsby, became manager in 1925. He and Dyer did not get along. According to one account, Dyer told Hornsby, \\"I'll never play on this club as long as you're the manager.\\" That earned him a return ticket to Syracuse in 1926, while the Cardinals won their first World Championship. In 1927 Dyer pitched once for St. Louis before he headed to Syracuse again. He won six games in a row, but on June 30 he hurt his arm in his first loss. That finished his pitching career. He appeared for the Cardinals in 129 games over all or parts of six seasons (1922–1927) — although 1924 and 1925 were his only full seasons in the majors — splitting 30 pitching decisions with an earned run average of 4.78, and batting .223 in 157 at bats with two home runs and 13 runs batted in. ==Minor league manager and executive == Dyer as manager of the Texas League Houston Buffaloes from 1939–1941 From 1928 on, Dyer managed in the Cardinals' farm system, continuing his playing career as an outfielder through 1933. He completed his Rice degree in 1936 and coached freshman football there (during baseball's off-season) for several years.http://ricehistorycorner.com/2010/11/24/eddie-dyer-and-the- polite-1921-rice-baseball-team/ In addition, Dyer served as business manager or club president of the teams he managed, and in 1938 he supervised all of the Cardinal farm teams in the Southern and Southwestern United States. The most important of these was Dyer's hometown Houston Buffaloes, the Cardinals’ club in the Class A1 Texas League. He took over as the Buffaloes' manager from 1939–1941 and led them to three consecutive first-place finishes and one league playoff championship, averaging 102 victories. During much of the wartime period that followed, Dyer was director of the entire Cardinals farm system, although he left that post in the midst of the 1944 season to tend to his oil, real estate and insurance businesses in Houston. ==Major league manager== At the war's end, and with the Cardinals in need of a manager upon Billy Southworth's departure for the Boston Braves, Dyer returned to baseball and his first Major-League managing assignment in 1946. The Cardinals were a powerhouse, having won three straight NL pennants from 1942–1944 and finished second in 1941 and 1945, but 1946 was an extremely challenging season for Dyer and his team. He had to blend returning war veterans and young players with Southworth's wartime club, and lost three key players — undefeated left-handed pitcher Max Lanier, second baseman Lou Klein and relief pitcher Fred Martin — to the marauding Mexican League. Dyer also had to deal with the Cards' implacable foes, the Dodgers of Leo Durocher, back at full strength after the war. Led by pitchers Howie Pollet and Harry Brecheen, and the hitting and leadership of future Hall of Famers Stan Musial and Enos Slaughter, the Cardinals made up a five-game All-Star Break deficit, won 14 of their 22 regular-season games with the Dodgers, and were tied with Brooklyn for the pennant on the season's final day. The Cards then swept the Dodgers in a best- of-three playoff behind the pitching of Pollet and Murry Dickson. In the 1946 World Series, the Redbirds faced what would be the only World Series in which Ted Williams would play. The Red Sox had breezed to the American League pennant by 12 games and featured 20-game winners Dave Ferriss and Tex Hughson. Idle during the NL playoffs, Boston played an exhibition game against an AL \\"all-star\\" team in an effort to tune up for the Fall Classic. Williams was struck on the elbow by a pitch, and when the Series began, he was ineffective. Brecheen won three games, the Cardinals played inspired baseball, and in the deciding seventh game, Slaughter scored from first on a double (often mistakenly remembered as a single) by Harry Walker, a shocking feat. His was the winning run in the game and the Series. The 1946 world championship was Dyer's high-water mark as Cardinal manager. The following season, Brooklyn upset the balance of power in the National League by boldly breaking the color line. In May 1947, the Cardinals became embroiled in a hotly denied rumor that they planned to strike, rather than permit Jackie Robinson on a Major League diamond — although Dyer was not implicated in the rumor. More damaging, for the next decade, the Cardinals would lag behind most of the other NL clubs in signing African-American players. Overall, the Cardinals reverted to bridesmaid status, finishing second from 1947–1949, although they trailed the Dodgers by only one game in . With the team's legendary farm system struggling without its founder — Branch Rickey, the very man who brought Robinson to Brooklyn — the Cardinals’ quarter-century of baseball dominance was coming to an end. In 1950, they fell to fifth and Dyer stepped down as manager at the end of the season.Eddie Dyer steps down as Cards manager During his five years as St. Louis manager, the Cardinals won 446 games and lost 325 for a .578 winning percentage. ==Later life== Dyer preferred to manage his thriving Houston-area businesses rather than seek another managing job in baseball. He suffered a stroke in January 1963, and died in Houston in April of the following year at the age of 64.Eddie Dyer, former Cardinal pilot, dies ==References== ==External links== *BaseballLibrary.com – biography and career highlights * Category:1899 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Austin Kangaroos football coaches Category:Baseball managers Category:Baseball players from Louisiana Category:Elmira Red Wings players Category:Greensboro Patriots players Category:Houston Buffaloes managers Category:Houston Buffaloes players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Minor league baseball executives Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:People from Morgan City, Louisiana Category:Rice Owls baseball players Category:Rice Owls football players Category:Rice Owls men's track and field athletes Category:Rochester Red Wings managers Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:St. Louis Cardinals managers Category:Scottdale Scotties players Category:Springfield Cardinals players Category:Springfield Red Wings players Category:Syracuse Stars (AA) players Category:Topeka Jayhawks players Category:Wichita Falls Spudders players Dy ","title":"Eddie Dyer"},{"id":"3240526","text":"Pak Hon-yong (Hangul: 박헌영, Hanja:朴憲永, 28 May 1900 – 18 December 1955:de:Pak Hon-yong) was a Korean independence activist, politician, philosopher and communist activist. One of the main leaders of the Korean communist movement during Japan's colonial rule (1910–45). His nickname was Ijong (이정) and Ichun (이춘), his courtesy name being Togyong (덕영). During the Japanese occupation of Korea, he tried to organize the Korean Communist Party. When the Japanese authorities cracked down on the party, he went into hiding. After Korea's liberation, August 1945, he set up the Communist Party of Korea in the South, but under pressure from American authorities he moved to North Korea in April 1948. He attended a meeting with Kim Gu and Kim Kyu-sik on the subject of Korean reunification. On record, he collaborated with Kim Il-sung in the Korean War. Pak Hon-yong seemed to have had confidence in the Korean War effort because the Workers' Party of South Korea, which had around 360,000 party members at that time. However, Park Hun-young did not expect the possibility of President Syngman Rhee massacring Southern dissenters, as in the Jeju Uprising, the Mungyeong Massacre and the Bodo League Massacre. In 1955, on account of the defeat in the Korean War, he was sentenced to forfeiture of all property and death. Although the Soviet Union and China tried to dissuade Kim Il-sung from executing Pak,Ivanov, Vasily Ivanovich, Memorandum of Conversation with Kim Il Sung : April 19, 1956 Wilson Center Digital Archive Pak was eventually executed for the fabricated accusation of being an American spy. == Life == ===Early life=== Pak was born to a yangban family of the Yeonghae Park lineage in Sinyang-myeon, Yesan County, Chungcheongnam-do. However, he was the illegitimate son of a concubine. In 1919, he graduated from Kyŏngsŏng Ordinary High School, now Kyunggi High School. In March 1919, he was involved in the March 1st Movement and later independence movements. === Political activities === In 1921, he joined the Shanghai branch of the Communist Party of Korea, Irkutsk faction. At this time, he was secretary of the Korean Communist Youth League. In January 1922, he participated in the Comintern Far East People's Representative Council in Moscow. Pak Hon-yong was arrested in Korea in April 1922 and was charged with being a Communist Party organizer. He was released in 1924 and became active as a reporter for the newspapers Dong-a Ilbo and Chosun Ilbo. ====Underground==== On 18 April 1925, Pak Hon-yong became one of the founders of the Communist Party of Korea. From this point until the end of World War II his activities were clandestine. In 1926, he appeared in court. During the trial, he feigned insanity and ate feces, with the result that he was acquitted in November of that year. Afterwards, he was confined to his home due to his supposed ill-health, but in December he escaped by way of Manchuria to reach the Soviet Union. It was only then that the Japanese realized that he was feigning madness. In the Soviet Union, he was educated in Communism, returning home in 1940. Back in Korea, he was active in the resistance to Japanese rule. ===After World War II=== Late in August 1945, the Communist Party of Korea(조선 공산당) was re-established, having been officially disbanded in 1928, and Pak became its secretary. On 5 January 1946, as its representative, he announced at a foreign and domestic press conference that, supporting the decision of the Moscow conference of great powers (UK, US, Soviet Union), Korea was now in the process of a \\"democratic revolution\\". After Moscow Conference (1945) his organization the Communist Party of Korea had been oppressed by United States Army Military Government. In December 1946, he organized the Workers Party of South Korea known as (남로당), and became its first secretary. === South and North Korea negotiations and life in North Korea === In April 1948, he visited North Korea for negotiations, along with Kim Gu and Kim Kyu-sik. In May 1948, the negotiations ended, and he remained in the North. In September 1948, while keeping his role as secretary of the Workers' Party of South Korea, he became Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of North Korea. Pak Hon-yong became secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea when the North and South parties united in April 1950. Pak was the vice chairman of the Politburo of the DPRK from 1949 to 1953. Pak was Foreign Minister of the DPRK until he was ousted and arrested in 1953. === Korean war === According to secret documents of the former Soviet Union released in succession until 2002, Kim Il-sung and Park Hun-young always acted together until the detailed plans of the war were finally decided. Kim Il-sung and Park Hun-young were also on hand during their visit to Moscow from 30 March to 25 April 1950, when they were approved for war by Stalin. During the visit, Kim Il-sung and Park Hun-young met Stalin and got written instructions of detailed war plans. ===Arrest and death=== Pak Hon-yong, 1952. Pak Hon-yong was arrested on 3 August 1953 in a purge of the formers members of the Workers' Party of South Korea by Kim Il-sung. On 15 December 1955, he was sentenced to death for espionage.

Striking Japan in September 1991, it became the 20th named storm of the 1991 Pacific typhoon season, Mireille formed on September 13 from the monsoon trough near the Marshall Islands. It moved westward for several days as a small system, steered by the subtropical ridge to the north. The storm rapidly intensified to typhoon status on September 16, and several days later passed north of Saipan in the Northern Marianas Islands. Mireille intensified further after deleterious effects from a nearby tropical storm subsided. On September 22, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated maximum 1‑minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), and on the next day, the official Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated 10‑minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). The typhoon weakened slightly while turning northward, passing just east of Miyako-jima and later to the west of Okinawa. On September 27, Mireille made landfall near Nagasaki in southwestern Japan with winds of 175 km/h (110 mph), the strongest since Typhoon Nancy in 1961. The storm accelerated to the northeast through the Sea of Japan, moving over Hokkaido before becoming extratropical on September 28\\\\. The remnants of Mireille continued to the east, passing through the Aleutian Islands of Alaska on October 1\\\\. The typhoon first threatened Guam, although it passed well to the north of the island, bringing damaging winds to northern Saipan. The first part of Japan affected was Miyako-jima, where heavy rainfall and high winds damaged crops. Mireille lashed Okinawa with strong waves, while strong winds up to 189 km/h (118 mph) damaged power lines and trees. The typhoon ultimately caused damage in 41 of 47 prefectures of Japan, with overall damage estimated at $10 billion (USD), making it the costliest typhoon on record as of 2017. Mireille produced record wind gusts at 26 locations, with a peak gust of 218 km/h (136 mph) in western Honshu. The winds caused record power outages across Japan that affected 7.36 million people, or about 13% of total customers. Mireille also left extensive crop damage totaling $3 billion, mostly to the apple industry, after 345,000 tons of apples fell to the ground and another 43,000 were damaged on the trees. The storm damaged over 670,000 houses, of which 1,058 were destroyed, and another 22,965 were flooded. Throughout Japan, Mireille killed 66 people and injured another 2,862 people, including ten deaths on a capsized freighter. Elsewhere, the typhoon killed two people in South Korea, and its remnants brought strong winds to Alaska. ==Meteorological history== The origins of Mireille were from a poorly-organized area of convection, or thunderstorms, associated with the monsoon trough near the Marshall Islands on September 13. That day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began tracking the system as a tropical depression. The system moved westward, developing a large increase in thunderstorms over the center on September 15\\\\. That day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, and issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 21W at 00:00 UTC, estimating 1‑minute sustained winds of 55 km/h (35 mph). About six hours later, the agency upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Mireille, after satellite imagery indicated the storm was very compact and intensifying quickly. The JTWC later determined in a post-storm analysis that Mireille had attained tropical storm status 12 hours earlier on the previous day. Also at the time of it attaining tropical storm status, Mireille was one of three storms in the basin, along with Tropical Storm Luke to the northwest and Typhoon Nat to the west in the South China Sea. Only 12 hours after the JTWC issued the first warning, Mireille attained typhoon status at 12:00 UTC on September 16, and several hours later reached an initial peak intensity of 135 km/h (85 mph). The small storm moved west-northwestward due to the influence of the subtropical ridge to the north. On September 17, the track shifted to the west-southwest, threatening Guam. The small typhoon turned more to the west, passing about 20 km (12 mi) north of Saipan on September 19, part of the Northern Marianas Islands north of Guam. For several days, Mireille failed to intensify due to wind shear from the larger Tropical Storm Luke to the north. After Luke weakened and progressed northward, Mireille was able to strengthen more gradually, as well as increase in size. On September 22, the typhoon strengthened into a super typhoon, which is an unofficial category used by the JTWC for storms reaching 1‑minute winds of at least 240 km/h (150 mph), equivalent to a strong Category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS. According to the JMA, Mireille attained 10‑minute winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) on September 23. Satellite image of Mireille west of Guam Around the time of reaching peak intensity, Mireille turned more to the northwest along the southwestern periphery of the subtropical ridge. The increasing size began to impart wind shear in Typhoon Nat to the west, and the two storms underwent the Fujiwhara effect, in which Nat turned sharply southward while Mireille progressed toward the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. After maintaining peak winds for about 30 hours, Mireille began weakening, passing just east of Miyako-jima on September 26 with 10‑minute winds of 165 km/h (105 mph), according to the JMA. That day, the typhoon accelerated to the northeast due to increasing mid-level winds from the southwest, passing west of Okinawa. According to the JMA, Mireille re-intensified slightly on September 27 to a secondary peak of 175 km/h (110 mph), aided by unusually warm water temperatures in the East China Sea. The typhoon made landfall at that strength at 07:00 UTC between Saikai and Nagasaki along southwest Kyushu. The pressure at landfall was , the lowest in the country since Typhoon Trix in 1971. The typhoon quickly weakened while continuing northeastward through Kyushu and western Honshu, and started to become an extratropical cyclone; during the process, the wind field expanded, aided by moist air from the southwest and cold air from the northwest. It accelerated further over the Sea of Japan, and late on September 27, Mireille made a second landfall in Japan along southwestern Hokkaido at 22:00 UTC, with 10‑minute winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) still at typhoon status. Crossing the island, the typhoon weakened to tropical storm status early on September 28, and shortly thereafter became fully extratropical in the Sea of Okhotsk. The powerful remnants of Mireille continued eastward, crossing the Aleutian Islands on September 29 and crossed the International Date Line shortly thereafter. That day, a pressure of 954 mb (hPa; 28.17 inHg) was observed in the Pribilof Islands of Alaska. Powerful winds battered vessels in the region, with the Merchant Pride reporting peak sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph). After crossing the dateline, Mireille's remnants turned northeast and struck the Seward Peninsula on October 3 before moving over Arctic Alaska. The system then moved over the Arctic Ocean where it was last noted on October 4. ==Preparations and impact== Early tropical cyclone computer models anticipated Mireille would pass close to Guam, prompting officials to undergo preparations for the storm. The storm ultimately passed north of Saipan, causing damage along the island's northern portion. Mireille knocked over trees and damaged over 70% of Saipan's crops while also eroding coastal roads. In South Korea, two people were killed with two others reported missing. A South Korean freighter rode out the storm at the port in Hakata Bay. It breached along the breakwater, causing it to sink, killing all 10 crew members. The Japan Coast Guard launched a search and rescue mission for two days. Later, the remnants of Mireille moved through the Aleutian Islands toward the end of September, bringing strong winds to the islands, including gusts over 112 km/h (70 mph) at Amchitka. ===Japan=== Map of the main islands of Japan Ahead of the storm, the JMA issued 99 typhoon bulletins, warning residents about Mireille. There were 236 warnings related to storm surge, high winds, waves, and flooding. In Hiroshima, most residents were aware of the approaching storm, about 70% of residents did not expect significant effects. In general, residents were unprepared for the storm, partly due to the lack of recent storms. Transportation in Japan was disrupted after 480 domestic flights cancelled, stranding 58,000 individuals, and road, rail, and ferry traffic was halted. In Hokkaido, 207 schools were closed due to the storm. Mireille was the strongest typhoon to hit Japan since Typhoon Nancy in 1961, causing heavy damage in 41 of 47 prefectures. It was the third storm to strike Japan in two weeks. Damage was heaviest on Kyushu where the storm made landfall. Because the storm moved northeastward through the Sea of Japan, the eastern quadrant of the storm crossed over much of the country, which is where the strongest winds in tropical cyclones are located. The high winds downed trees, damaged roofs, and left record power outages, affecting 7.36 million people, or about 13% of total customers. In some areas, the power outages lasted as little as three minutes. The storm damaged over 670,000 houses, of which 1,058 were destroyed, and another 22,965 were flooded. Power outages caused at least five factories to shut down production. Along the coast, the typhoon damaged 930 ships, with dozens sunk or blown ashore. Most of the damage was related to agriculture or forests. Sea spray heavily damaged fruit trees and rice paddies. Crop damage amounted to $3 billion, mostly to the apple industry, after 345,000 tons of apples fell to the ground and another 43,000 were damaged on the trees. Most farms lost 80% of their crop, potentially taking 10 years to regrow. Persistent cloudiness and rainfall following the storm diminished sunlight by 50%, furthering crop damage. There were 62 deaths in Japan and 2,862 injuries, including the deaths on the South Korean freighter, making it the deadliest typhoon there in 10 years. About 80% of the deaths were male, and 70% were over 60 years old. Most of the deaths were related to wind-blown debris, falling due to the wind, or being trapped or struck by fallen objects. The $6 billion in insured losses and $10 billion in overall damage made Mireille the costliest typhoon on record as of January 2015, according to Munich Re. When Mireille moved through western Japan, it brought strong winds and heavy rainfall. The highest sustained wind was 162 km/h (101 mph) at Nomozaki, Nagasaki, and gusts nearby peaked at 218 km/h (136 mph). Misawa Air Base along northern Honshu reported winds of at least 93 km/h (58 mph) for five hours, with a peak gust of 152 km/h (94 mph). This was the highest wind report at the station since records began in 1946. The strongest wind gusts occurred concurrently with a sudden drop in atmospheric pressure, primarily from Kyushu and extending east-northeastward into the Chūgoku region of Honshu. Mireille produced record wind gusts at 26 locations and record sustained winds at 12 locations. At landfall, Mireille produced winds of at least 54 km/h (34 mph) across a diameter of 600 km (375 mi). About two-thirds of the wind stations reported the strongest winds from the west after Mireille passed the area. Winds were lightest in eastern Honshu, Mireille also dropped heavy rainfall, mostly on Shikoku, peaking at at Kito, Tokushima. In nearby Kōchi Prefecture, the heaviest hourly rainfall total was , the highest in the nation for the storm. The rains caused at least 13 landslides and flooded rivers in four locations. However, effects from rainfall were limited due to the storm's fast forward motion. Mireille also struck around the time of high tide, causing extensive storm surge along the coast. Mireille first passed near Miyako-jima, dropping of rainfall there. Wind gusts on the island reached 176 km/h (110 mph), which caused some crop damage to sugar cane and vegetables. All flights were canceled as Mireille passed the island. Later, the typhoon bypassed Okinawa to the west. The island experienced winds of at least 93 km/h (58 mph) for 27 hours, with gusts of 152 km/h (92 mph) at Kadena Air Base. The capital city, Naha, reported gusts of 180 km/h (112 mph), while the highest gust in the region was 189 km/h (118 mph) on Kume Island. Mireille produced heavy rainfall on Okinawa, totaling 258 mm (10.14 in), which allowed water restrictions there to be lifted for the rest of the year. The precipitation fell in a short amount of time; dropped in just 10 minutes, and dropped in an hour, both at Naha. Waves reached 13.7 m (50 ft) along the coast of Okinawa. On Kume Island, the combination of high waves and tides produced damaging storm surge. The storm flooded 74 houses and damaged another 37. Mireille damaged roads in two locations, while winds damaged 157 power lines, which cut communications to 3,123 people. The storm also left heavy damage to the agriculture and forest industries. In the region, Mireille caused 44 flights to be canceled. Two people were injured on Okinawa, and overall damage in the prefecture totaled ¥1.5 billion (US$11.4 million). In Kyushu, the heavy rainfall caused flooding and landslides, which buried several houses in Miyazaki Prefecture and forced 75 people to evacuate. The high wind knocked over many cypress or cedar trees, totaling 22529 ha (55,670 acres) and accounting for ¥64 billion (US$530 million) in damage in Ōita Prefecture alone. Damage was heaviest near Nagasaki, where 16 people were killed, including five after a warehouse collapsed during the storm. A construction worker in nearby Isahaya was killed when the winds struck him with a prebuilt hut, and airborne debris killed five people in Kumamoto Prefecture and seven in Fukuoka Prefecture. Throughout Kyushu, about 2 million people lost power. High winds and waves in Kagoshima Prefecture overturned several cars, killing one person in Ōshima. Throughout Kyushu, about 2 million people lost power. On nearby Shikoku island, high winds and rains caused ¥4.7 billion (US$35.7 million) in damage in Tokushima, mostly related to fisheries, crops, and houses. A record storm surge, in conjunction with high winds, damaged a school in Sakaide, as well as a floating pier and coastal road in nearby Ehime Prefecture. Rough surf swept away a woman in Matsuyama. The storm track brought Mireille west of the most populated island of Honshu, limiting damage there compared to Kyushu. At Misawa Air Base, the strong winds knocked over trees and blew off the roofs of several warehouses, and also knocked off storage sheds off their foundation. Ahead of the storm, advance warning allowed the American military to shelter aircraft and warn the population. Damage was estimated between $500,000-$1.5 million. Two of Mazda's loading docks in Hiroshima were completely destroyed, affecting American inventories of 1992 Mazda 929's until the end of November 1991. Also in the city, 1.1 million residents, or 80% of households, lost power due to winds and storm surge. In Yamaguchi Prefecture, the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company was flooded with 0.6 m (2 ft) of waters, forcing workers to move to another plant in the United States. The strong winds and waves damaged the Itsukushima Shrine near Hiroshima and Kenroku-en northwest of Tokyo. In Okayama Prefecture, salt spray damaged railways and shut down lines for three days. High winds in Naka-ku collapsed scaffolding from a parking garage, and another damaged scaffolding nearby forced a road to shut down. There were extensive crop losses in northern Honshu. In Toyama Prefecture, the winds destroyed 192 greenhouses and exasperated a fire that caused further crop damage. Striking Hokkaido with much of its former intensity, Mireille produced strong winds across the island. Hakodate Airport reported a peak gust of 124 km/h (77 mph), and the highest sustained wind was 79 km/h (49 mph) in Urakawa. Along the coast, waves reached 7.7 m (25 ft) high at Matsumae, killing one person in Kushiro who was mooring his boat. Light rains occurred on the island, reaching in Hidaka. In Hakodate, the storm damaged five buildings, and about 3,000 houses lost power. There was scattered roof damage across Hokkaido, and flying glass injured one person. ==Aftermath== By a day after the storm made landfall, the record power outages were largely restored. However, salt damage prevented restoration in some areas for several days. The outages left residents temporarily without water after water pumps were shut down. In Hiroshima, lack of power caused traffic congestion, shut down banks, and disrupted hospitals. The widespread power outages related to Mireille prompted the government to reconstruct transmission towers with anemometer, or wind measurement devices. Following the storm, insurance companies paid $6 billion to policy holders in Japan, which was a world record related to wind damage; this was surpassed less than a year later by Hurricane Andrew striking Florida. The typhoon still holds the title as the costliest non-Atlantic hurricane. Due to the severity of damage and loss of life caused by the storm, the name Mireille was retired and replaced with Melissa. ==See also== *Typhoon Sarah (1959) - similarly powerful typhoon that also recurved near South Korea and Japan *Typhoon Chaba (2004) - typhoon that moved northeastward through Japan ==Notes== ==References== Category:Retired Pacific typhoons Category:1991 Pacific typhoon season Category:Typhoons in Japan Typhoon Mireille Mireille ","title":"Typhoon Mireille"},{"id":"3240544","text":" The Douglas A-33 (Model 8A-5) was an American attack aircraft built in small numbers during World War II. It was an updated version of the Northrop A-17, with a more powerful engine and an increased bomb load. While the A-33 was intended initially for the export market, the entire production run was taken up by the United States Army Air Corps. ==Design and development== In 1932, the Northrop Corporation had been formed as a partly owned subsidiary of Douglas and by 1937, the Northrop Model 8 became known as the Douglas 8A produced in the El Segundo Division of Douglas aircraft. The 8A-5 was powered by a 1,200 hp (895 kW) Wright R-1820-87 engine and was the most powerful and best armed of the series, fitted with four wing mounted 0.30 in machine guns, two 0.50 in machine guns in pods below the wing and a rear-firing flexibly mounted 0.30 in gun, and could carry up to 2,000 lb of bombs. ==Operational history== Early in 1940, the Norwegian government ordered 36 8A-5s which not had been delivered before Norway was invaded by the Germans. Completed between October 1940 and January 1941, the aircraft were delivered to a training center in Canada that had been set up for the Norwegian government-in-exile, named \\"Little Norway\\" at Toronto Island Airport, Ontario. After the loss of two aircraft and a reassessment of the training needs now met by the use of other aircraft, the remaining 34 Model 8A-5Ps were sold to Peru. However, 31 were repossessed by the Army Air Corps at the start of World War II. These aircraft, designated A-33, were used for training, target tug, and utility duties.Pelletier Air Enthusiast September/October 1998, pp. 3–4. ==Variants== ;Model 8A-5 : ;A-33 : :Serial numbers: 42-13584/13601 ; 42-109007/109019 ==Operators== ; * Little Norway ; ; * United States Army Air Corps ==Specifications (A-33)== ==See also== ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * Francillon, René J.

Hildreth at the United States' National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame Retrieved July 22, 2017 ==Biography== Born in Independence, Missouri, Sam Hildreth began his training career in 1887, competing at racetracks in the Midwestern United States with such horses as the good racemare Hurley Burley, the dam of Burgomaster. In 1898 he moved to New York City where thoroughbred racing was a leading sport offering the largest purses. He was first hired to train horses owned by wealthy businessman William Collins Whitney, but soon set out on his own, buying horses for himself and training for others. He won his first of seven Belmont Stakes in 1899 with the horse Jean Bereaud for owner Sydney Paget. By the turn of the 20th century, Samuel Hildreth had expanded his New York operations and owned the largest racing stables at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans. That year, he appointed former outlaw Frank James as his betting commissioner at the track. Among the horses Hildreth owned was Fitz Herbert (b. 1906) who won the Brooklyn Handicap, Suburban Handicap, and the Jerome Handicap en route to being voted the Horse of the Year in 1909, and again in 1910. Another of his horses, King James, won other important races in 1909, including the Metropolitan Handicap, Sheepshead Bay Handicap, and the California Handicap, and went on to win the Brooklyn Handicap in 1910. In 1909, Hildreth also won his second Belmont Stakes with his own horse, Joe Maddon, and went on to capture the first of three consecutive leading owner and trainer honors in the United States. The Hart–Agnew Law which banned parimutuel betting was passed by the New York Legislature and resulted in the closure of all New York racetracks between 1911 and 1912. Hildreth and numerous other racing stables went to race in Canada where he won the 1911 Windsor Hotel Cup Handicap at Blue Bonnets Raceway in Montreal. On November 2, 1911, the New York Times reported that Sam Hildreth and jockey Carroll Shilling had sailed to England aboard the RMS Mauretania with the intent of racing there for the stable of American owner, Charles Kohler. However, Kohler subsequently set up operations in France and in 1912 Sam Hildreth trained a stable of horses for him at Val-d'Oise, near Paris. Sam Hildreth's stable trained for other prominent owners such as August Belmont Jr. for whom he won back-to-back Belmont Stakes in 1916 and 1917. He also met with great success training for Rancocas Stable owned by wealthy oil industrialist Harry F. Sinclair. For Sinclair he won three Belmont Stakes with Grey Lag in 1921, Zev in 1923 and Mad Play in 1924. In an era before the Triple Crown had any significance, Hildreth only entered a few horses in the Kentucky Derby because of the time restraints for the long journey to Kentucky. As such, David J. Leary is listed as the trainer of Zev for his win in the 1923 Kentucky Derby. Back in New York, in October of that year, Zev defeated Epsom Derby winner Papyrus, marking the first time a Kentucky Derby winner defeated an English Derby winner. Twice Sam Hildreth won more races in a year than any other trainer in the United States and was the top money-earning trainer nine times, a record that stood for more than sixty years until broken by D. Wayne Lukas in 1992. Hildreth's seven Belmont Stakes victories ranks him second only to James G. Rowe, Sr. and five times his horses were chosen American Horse of the Year, the highest honor in thoroughbred horse racing. In 1925, Hildreth co- wrote an article with James R. Crowell titled \\"Down the Stretch\\" for The Saturday Evening Post. The two then collaborated on a history of American racing in a book titled \\"The Spell of the Turf\\" published in 1926 by J. B. Lippincott & Co. of Philadelphia. In this book, he named Purchase as one of the greatest horses he ever trained. After forty-three years as a horse trainer, Sam Hildreth died at a hospital in Manhattan, New York following an unsuccessful operation for an intestinal disorder. He was buried in Greenridge Cemetery, Saratoga Springs, New York. In 1955, Sam Hildreth was posthumously inducted into the newly formed National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. ==References== * Hildreth, Samuel C. and Crowell, James R.

This evidence were discovered by archaeologists near Hajij village and include stone tools that made by Neanderthals or Early Modern Humans. Evidence for Late Paleolithic occupation discovered in a cave site in the Perdi Mala valley.Biglari, F and S.

The Parchments of Awraman, a set of three documents from the Seleucid and Parthian eras, were found in the region in 1909. They were discovered in a cave on Kuh-e Salan Mountain, near the village of Shar Hawraman, and subsequently sent to London. Ancient religions are also practiced throughout Avroman and the region is home to the ancient holy places of the Yarsan faith. Some scholars believe that the name Hawraman or Huraman has strong connections to the ancient Zoroastrian faith and claim that the name may have originated from Ahuraman or Ahura Mazda.Nyberg, H.S. (1923), The Pahlavi documents of Avroman, Le Monde Oriental, XVII, p.189. This is very interesting for those interested in investigating the survival of Parthian usage of Zoroastrian terminology among the local Kurds of modern day Hawraman (Avroman). Ahura Mazda is the name of God in the ancient Indo-Iranian Avestan language and comes from the ancient Zoroastrian faith, which is still being practiced by very small numbers of people in the region. Many areas in the Avroman region are believed to have been pilgrimage sites for Zoroastrians prior to the advent of Islam.CHN  Tourism and Travel One of the oldest Islamic period evidence is Negel quran.

Traditional clothing for women includes either a vest or long-sleeved jacket or long overcoat worn over a gown. An under dress and puffy pants is worn beneath the gown. Traditionally women wore Kurdish hats ornamented with valued coloured stones, beads and gold pieces. Usually younger women and young girls wear brightly coloured dresses adorned with many beads and sequins and the older women wear darker colours and white head-cover. Hawrami men generally wear a shirt; a vest with an open neck; and baggy trousers fitted at the ankles. A cotton sash 3–4 m long is folded in half lengthwise and wrapped tightly around the torso on waist. Men also wore traditional brown felt jackets with pointed shoulders called Kolabal. Siyaw Chemane is a style of singing practiced by the Kurds in Avroman people and means dark eyes in Hewrami. It is performed without the use of any instruments, with the exception of the occasional use of a Kurdish hand-drum or Daff. Today, the Siya Cheman style is used mostly for storytelling and entertainment. ==References== ==External links== * Omid Sālehi, Customs of the Land of Stone and Wind (Ā'in-e Sar'zamin-e Sang va Bād), in Persian, Jadid Online, 5 May 2009, .

His expression of frustration and direct confrontation with the occupants states of larger Kurdistan made his simple poet a symbol in the Kurds cause for freedom. === Death and Legacy=== Dildar died young at the age of 3‌1 of a heart disease in 1948. However, he lived to see his poem \\"Ey Reqîb\\" being adopted as the Kurdish national anthem. Ey Reqîb was first played and sung in 1946 on the proclamation of the short-lived Republic of Mahabad. Today the song is played as the official regional anthem of Iraqi Kurdistan. == Notes == == References == * \\"DELDĀR\\", Encyclopedia Iranica Category:Kurdish-language poets Category:Kurdish people Category:1918 births Category:1948 deaths Category:Iraqi Kurdish poets Category:People from Koy Sanjaq Category:20th-century Iraqi poets ","title":"Dildar (poet)"},{"id":"3240636","text":"Opération Azalée (French for Azalea) was the name of an expedition by the French armed forces and French special forces which took place in 1995 to remove the provisional government of the Comoros that was led and put into power by famed mercenary Bob Denard. ==Denard coup== Denard's fourth Comorian coup, which he called Operation Kaskari, occurred in the early hours of 28 September 1995. Denard and 33 hand-picked mercenaries docked their ship, Vulcain, at Moroni harbour and descended on the city, forcibly removing the figures of the official government before the ill-equipped army was aware. The invaders had been stowing away on Vulcain for more than a month, and were greeted at their arrival by vans supplied by the relatives of former president Ahmed Abdallah. The French authorities had some advance notice of the coup, as they had before. But unlike Denard's previous coups, the French government opposed the mercenaries and denounced Denard. Knowing this, Denard's first priority was to prevent the likely counter-coup from his homeland. In addition to political pacification measures, such as forming a civilian government, Denard also tried to recreate the 500-strong presidential guard that he had led after his second coup (1978–1989). Denard's popularity during the early 1980s enabled him to mobilise 300 supporters within five days and place them around ports and airports, where they would be most effective to ambush French invaders with submachine guns. ==Response== France had advance knowledge of the coup, but refrained from preventative measures until after it had occurred. As news of the coup came, the French government denounced Denard and his mercenaries. Knowing what they would encounter on the islands, the French did not pursue their extreme numerical advantage, instead handing control to the Special Operations Command. Eventually, 400 marines and 200 other special operations experts began cruising the Indian Ocean in patrol boats and a frigate, with superior logisticians and helicopters in tow. ==Azalée== Making landfall at 23:00 on 3 October, the GIGN immediately sought to overawe the mercenary-dissident alliance. The specialist operators had little trouble in taking both airports, the French embassy and Vulcain, capturing many Denard supporters. Denard was outmanned, outgunned and outmechanised by the invaders. Although small defending forces had managed to repel attackers in the past (e.g. Rorke's Drift), this would usually involve some specific advantage in intelligence, training or guerilla tactics. Knowing he had no such advantage, Denard sent the message to the men defending the barracks that they should lay down their arms if engaged by the French. The specialists encircled the barracks in the early hours of 5 October, and Denard was arrested at 03:00 and flown to a Parisian jail. President Djohar, who was held captive in the barracks, was flown to Réunion for medical treatment. This would be the last of four Denard coups in the Comoros, although another coup would occur on the day Denard went to trial. Since independence in 1975, the Comoros has been subject to over 20 attempts to overthrow the government. This one was only a partial failure in all of the objectives—Djohar was refused re-entry into the Comoros until the 1996 elections, which he lost. Four Comorians died during Operation Azalée, and nine people were wounded. ==References== ==Sources== *History of the Comoros since 1975 *Operation Azalée Category:Attempted coups d'état Category:History of the Comoros Category:Wars involving the Comoros Category:GIGN missions Category:Conflicts in 1995 Category:1995 in the Comoros Category:Operations involving French special forces Category:Military operations involving France Category:October 1995 events in Africa ","title":"Operation Azalee"},{"id":"3240652","text":" The Kaiser-Fleetwings A-39 was a project by Kaiser-Fleetwings in the 1942–1943 period for an attack aircraft powered by a single Pratt & Whitney R-2800 radial engine.

This contrasted with the Group A all-out competition production-derived vehicles. Group N cars are limited in terms of modifications made from standard specification. Group N was introduced by the FIA in 1982 to replace the outgoing Group 1 as \\"standard touring cars\\". To qualify for homologation, a minimum of 2500 cars of the competing model had to be built in one year, out of 25,000 for the entire range of the model (e.g.: 2500 Subaru Impreza WRX, out of 25,000 Subaru Impreza). The Group N regulations were officially replaced in 2013. No new cars were homologated under Group A or Group N regulations, and instead existing cars were reclassified according to Group R rules (specifically the R4 class). The R4 class itself was gradually phased out. In 2015, the FIA realigned the rally classes yet again, finalizing the phase-out of R4. A new class, NR4 was added, identical to the previous Group N class, just with a new name to fit in with the other \\"R\\" names. R4 cars were then not allowed in FIA sanctioned rallies in Europe, but since R4 was basically a transition group for old Group N, many of those could likely be re-homologated as NR4. ==Road racing== Renault 5 GT Turbo, Gr. N world championship winner in 1989 & 1990 While Group A became the standard category for international touring car racing, Group N found a home as a more economic class in national touring car racing. In many countries, there would often be two touring car championships, one for Group A and one for Group N. The category had some brief success with the demise of the Supertouring class in the late 1990s, when a few national regulations were relaxed to allow a greater number of modifications, in the guise of Super Production. ===Endurance racing=== The category is still used in circuit racing all over the world, notably in Japan which has the long running , as well as in the Italian ETCS endurance series run by Peroni Promotion, but was once again relegated to a secondary status with the introduction of Super 2000, the class of cars currently run in the World Touring Car Championship. ==Rallying== A Subaru Impreza WRX STI at the 2006 Acropolis Rally In Rallying, the Production World Rally Championship was run under Group N rules until 2012. The cars used were modified road cars, often based on turbocharged, four wheel drive versions of standard small cars such as the Subaru Impreza WRX and the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, although a wide range of vehicles were homologated by the FIA for use in Group N. In the reform of the support category in 2013 season, the Group N4's car was one of the eligible cars in WRC-2 Category, considering its competitiveness to the other type of cars like Super 2000 and Group R cars in the category, there will also be a FIA Production Car Cup among N4 cars in WRC-2, (although, under new group R rules, no new Group N cars will be homologated by FIA and will be phased out in the future.) Apart from FIA sanctioned events, many rallies at national levels are run under Group N. Some local variants of Group N have been created to allow other marques to compete where Group N is the national formula. ==Allowed modifications== The range of modifications allowed was quite narrow - few mechanical engine modifications were allowed (save for lightening within set limits and baffled sumps) although the choice of ECU was free, and this could liberate some extra power itself, and most of the modifications allowed were to promote longevity rather than increased performance, although the boundaries of these two areas were blurring towards the end of the group's lifespan. Furthermore, cars with forced induction engines were fitted with a restrictor in front of the charger to limit power.Subaru parts lists for the Group N base car (PDF) Originally, Group N meant that all the interior trim had to be present (including the rear seat), but it later changed to allow removal of the trim aside from the dashboard and replacement of the door trim. The springs and dampers were free, as are the internals of the gearbox and the final-drive ratio, providing that the homologated gear ratios and gear change pattern were respected. This allowed the use of dog-engagement gearboxes, providing quicker gearchanges and longer gearbox life. There was provision for strengthening of the suspension components and bodyshell, provided this didn't alter the operating principle.Group N Cars as described in rallycars.com The FIA and many national motorsport associations were moving towards making rallying championships based in Group N (until it was replaced by Group R), in an attempt to reduce costs, reinforce the link between motorsport and the car that the member of the public drives, and to reduce the environmental impact of motorsport. The GpN 4WD Turbo rally car category underwent the process of being renamed as R4 for 2011. The key areas were that standard road car bodywork and driven wheels were retained from the road car that could be bought from the showroom. ==References== ==External links== *Group N Category:Touring car racing Category:Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile Category:Rally groups Category:Racing car classes ","title":"Group N"},{"id":"3240670","text":"Bloodletting was the ritualized self-cutting or piercing of an individual's body that served a number of ideological and cultural functions within ancient Mesoamerican societies, in particular the Maya. When performed by ruling elites, the act of bloodletting was crucial to the maintenance of sociocultural and political structure. Bound within the Mesoamerican belief systems, bloodletting was used as a tool to legitimize the ruling lineage's socio-political position and, when enacted, was important to the perceived well-being of a given society or settlement. ==Description== Mexico, probably Guerrero, Olmec Blood-letter Handle, 1000-600BC Bloodletting was performed by piercing a soft body part, generally the tongue or penis, and scattering the blood or collecting it on amate, which was subsequently burned.See Joyce et al., p. 2. The act of burning the sacrificed blood symbolized the transferral of the offering to the gods via its transformation into the rising smoke. Piercing was accomplished using obsidian prismatic blades, stingray spines, or shark's teeth. Under some circumstances, a rope with attached thorns or obsidian flakes would be pulled through the tongue or earlobes. Jade or stone spines and teeth have been found in the archaeological record. Some of these jade artifacts have rather dull points but might have been used once the initial cut was made, or might purely be ritualistic objects not used in actual bloodletting.Taube, p. 122. The location of the bloodletting on the body often correlated with an intended result or a corresponding symbolic representation. For example, drawing blood from the genitals, especially the male sex organs, would be done with the intent of increasing or representing human fertility. ==Ritual performance== Lintel 24 at Yaxchilan, depicting Lady Xoc drawing a barbed rope through her tongue. Ritualized bloodletting was typically performed by elites, settlement leaders, and religious figures (e.g., shamans) within contexts visible to the public. The rituals were enacted on the summits of pyramids or on elevated platforms that were usually associated with broad and open plazas or courtyards (where the masses could congregate and view the bloodletting). This was done so as to demonstrate the connection the person performing the auto-sacrifice had with the sacred sphere and, as such, a method used to maintain political power by legitimizing their prominent social, political, and/or ideological position. While usually carried out by a ruling male, prominent females are also known to have performed the act. The El Perú tomb of a female (called the \\"Queen's Tomb\\") contains among its many grave goods a ceremonial stingray spine associated with her genital region. One of the best-known lintels from Mesoamerica, Yaxchilan Lintel 24 (right), shows Lady Xoc drawing a barbed rope through her tongue. In front of her, her husband and the ruler of Yaxchilan, Shield Jaguar, is shown holding a torch. ==Ideological undertones== Among all the Mesoamerican cultures, sacrifice, in whatever form, was a deeply symbolic and highly ritualized activity with strong religious and political significance. Various kinds of sacrifice were performed within a range of sociocultural contexts and in association with a variety of activities, from mundane everyday activities to those performed by the elites and ruling lineages with the aim of maintaining social structure. The social structure was maintained by showing that rulers blood sacrifice to the gods showed the power they had. At its core, sacrifice symbolized the renewal of divine energy and, in doing so, the continuation of life. Its ability of bloodletting to do this is based on two intertwined concepts that are prevalent in the Maya belief system. The first is the notion that the gods had given life to humankind by sacrificing parts of their own bodies. The second is the central focus of their mythology on human blood, which signified life among the Maya. Within their belief system, human blood was partially made up of the blood of the gods, who sacrificed their own divine blood in creating life in humans. Thus, in order to continually maintain the order of their universe, the Maya believed that blood had to be given back to the gods. The rulers are giving their blood to empower the gods in return for giving them life. Olmec-style jadeite \\"spoon\\", believed to be a perforator, from Guerrero. 1500-300 BCThis particular artifact, from the Snite Museum of Art, is labelled as a bloodletter. This is echoed by Gillett Griffin, who states that the spoon \\"probably had a ritual function in bloodletting or in the absorption of hallucinogens for ritual purposes\\" (Griffin, p. 219). There is some disagreement, however, in this identification: Justin Kerr, for example, tentatively identifies similar Maya implements as \\"symbolic jade versions\\" of a paint container for a scribe (see \\"Where Do You Wear Your Paint-Pot?\\". ==Depictions of bloodletting in Mesoamerican cultures== Unlike later cultures, there is no representation of actual bloodletting in Olmec art. However, solid evidence for its practice exists in the jade and ceramic replicas of stingray spines and shark teeth as well as representations of such paraphernalia on monuments and stelaeTwo apparent perforators hang across the chest of the figure in Monument 6 of Laguna de los Cerros. Taube, p. 123. and in iconography.Icons which represent bloodletting are thought to include a fish zoo-morph. See Joyce et al. A proposed translation of the Epi-Olmec culture's La Mojarra Stela 1, dated to roughly AD 155, tells of the ruler's ritual bloodletting by piercing his penis and his buttocks, as well as what appears to be a ritual sacrifice of the ruler's brother-in-law.Kaufman (2000) and Justeson and Kaufman (2001). Bloodletting permeated Maya life. Kings performed bloodletting at every major political event. Building dedications, burials, marriages, and births all required bloodletting.Schele and Miller, p. 175-176. As demonstrated by Yaxchilan Lintels 24 and 25, and duplicated in Lintels 17 and 15, bloodletting in Maya culture was also a means to a vision quest, where fasting, loss of blood, and perhaps hallucinogenics lead to visions of ancestors or gods. Contemporaneous with the Maya, the south-central panel at the Classic era South Ballcourt at El Tajín shows the rain god piercing his penis, the blood from which flows into and replenishes a vat of the alcoholic ritual drink pulque.Wilkerson, p. 66. ==Early European reactions== Following the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs in 1521, many Spanish missionary-ethnographers arrived and recorded graphic and often unsympathetic descriptions of these rituals among both the Mayan and Nahuatl speaking peoples. Although most understood the religious significance of the rites, such idolatry merely confirmed the need for rapid conversion to Christianity. Many also confused genital bloodletting with circumcision, not least because they believed Indians were descendants of the lost tribes of Israel.See Diego Durán's The History of the Indies of New Spain, for Jewish origins and his Gods and Rites for circumcision One of the first to recognise the distinction was Diego de Landa in a 1566 manuscript: > \\"At times they sacrificed their own blood, cutting all around the ears in > strips which they let hang as a sign. At other times they perforated their > cheeks or the lower lip; again they made cuts in parts of the body, or > pierced the tongue crossways and passed stalks through, causing extreme > pain; again they hewed at the superfluous part of the penis, leaving the > flesh in the form of two floppy ears. It was this custom which misled > [engaño] the historian-general of the Indies to say that they practised > circumcision.\\"(original translation) Nonetheless, the misconception that the Aztec and Maya people practised circumcision persists to this day. ==See also== *Human sacrifice in Maya culture *Sacrifice in Maya culture ==Notes== ==References== * * (2004) Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization, Social Science, 390 pages. * Ancient Mexico & Central America. * * (2003) Mesoamerican Archaeology: Theory and Practice, Blackwell Studies in Global Archaeology, Wiley-Blackwell, . * (1991) \\"Olmec Bloodletting: An Iconographic Study\\" in Sixth Palenque Roundtable, 1986, ed.

Grafulla (1812–1880) was a composer in the United States during the 19th Century, most noted for martial music for regimental bands during the early days of the American Civil War.\\"The President's Own\\" United States Marine Band, Hall of Composers ==Biography== Grafulla was born on 31 October 1812 on Menorca, an island off the coast of Spain that was occupied by the British after the Napoleonic wars. At the age of 28, he emigrated to the United States, where he became a French horn player in Napier Lothian's New York Brass Band in New York City. This band was attached to the 7th Regiment of the New York National Guard, which was honored in 1922 by John Philip Sousa's The Gallant Seventh march. In 1860, he added woodwinds to a reorganized band and continued to serve as its director until his death at New York on 2 December 1880. Grafulla was a quiet, unassuming man who never married; his whole life centered on his music. His remarkable technical and musical skills allowed him to become well known as a composer, often writing music to order, and as an arranger. As a director of the 7th Regiment Band, his fame spread widely. Grafulla composed Washington Grays in 1861 for the 8th Regiment, New York State Militia. This work has been called a march masterpiece, a band classic, and the prototype of the concert march. Showing the stylistic influence of both German and Italian marches, the march has a marvelous balance of technique and melody in a continuous flow of musical ideas. It dared to break the old formulas, however, because it has no introduction, no break strain, and no stinger. Curiously, long after Grafulla's death, during the presidential contest of 1896, while McKinley and Bryan were debating the burning issue of a silver vs. gold monetary standard, his publishers issued a Solid Money March under the palindrome, \\"C.S.Allufarg\\". Some of Grafulla's works, including \\"Parade\\" and \\"Freischutz Quickstep\\", were heard in the 1990 Ken Burns PBS miniseries, The Civil War. ==ReferencesWorks of Claudio S.

It is set in a post-apocalyptic 1974, ten years after a nuclear holocaust in the United States. The episode is a cautionary tale about humanity's greed and the danger of questioning one's faith in forces greater than oneself. ==Opening narration== ==Plot== In a sparsely populated town in 1974, ten years after a nuclear war has devastated the US, the townspeople have discovered a supply of canned food. However, they are waiting for Mr. Goldsmith, the town's leader, to return with a message from the mysterious and unseen \\"old man in the cave\\" who will tell them whether the food is contaminated with radiation. Some of the townsfolk want to take their chances and eat the food, but they refrain from doing so after seeing the disastrous harvest yielded when they failed to take the old man's advice about which farming areas were contaminated. When Mr. Goldsmith returns, he informs them that the old man has declared the food is contaminated and that it should be destroyed. Shortly thereafter, a group of soldiers led by Major French enter the town and clash with Goldsmith as they try to establish their authority. The soldiers may or may not be representatives of the US government; Goldsmith claims that wandering packs of self-styled military men have previously intruded on the town and tried to establish authority—all unsuccessfully. French, meanwhile, reveals that there are maybe 500 people left alive between Buffalo, New York and Atlanta, Georgia, and also talks of small, isolated primitive societies on the shores of Lake Erie and in \\"what used to be\\" Chicago. He claims his job is to organize the region so that society can be re-built. However, Goldsmith believes that French and his men simply want to strip the town of its food. A clash of wills ensues and, frustrated by Goldsmith's quiet and steadfast refusal to bend, French tries to dispel the townspeople's strange beliefs about the seemingly infallible old man in the cave and take control of the area. French tempts the townspeople with some of the food Goldsmith claimed was contaminated and many throw caution to the wind and partake. Everyone except Goldsmith eventually consumes the food and drink and Goldsmith falls into disfavor among the townspeople. After being bullied and threatened with his life, Goldsmith finally opens the cave door and it is ultimately revealed that in reality, the townsfolk have been using information from a computer the whole time. French rallies the townspeople into a frothing frenzy into destroying the machine, after which French leads the people into celebrating their new found freedom from this \\"tyranny\\". However, as Mr. Goldsmith had insisted, the \\"old man\\" was correct; without an authority figure to tell them which foods are safe, the entire human population of the town (including French and the soldiers) die—except for the lone survivor, Mr. Goldsmith, who somberly walks out of the now dead town. ==Closing narration== ==Episode notes== In the post-apocalyptic world presented in the episode, humanity has destroyed itself, but does so through \\"greed, desire and faithlessness\\". It is thus a warning not to ignore faith, which often serves an important purpose in society. The events in the episode show that myths and beliefs are often based on fact or necessity, as is the case with the \\"old man\\" who, despite being a computer, was ultimately keeping his \\"followers\\" alive. According to Valerie Barr of Hofstra University, it also \\"turns the usual notion of overreliance on technology on its head\\" by suggesting an interdependence with machines when it is revealed that a man-made computer has been keeping the townspeople alive. A suggested learning plan accompanying this episode for the SyFy Channel's participation in Cable in the Classroom provides a platform for exploring ideas about war, faith, and the question of whether humans control computers or vice versa. Film critic Andrew Sarris noted in his review of \\"Time Enough at Last\\" that, at the time The Twilight Zone was produced, depicting an atom bomb explosion or its aftermath on network television would likely have been prohibited if it had been \\"couched in a more realistic format\\".Sarris, Andrew.

LEAPS are available on approximately 2500 equities and 20 indexes. As with traditional short term options, LEAPS are available in two forms, calls and puts. Options were originally created with expiry cycles of 3, 6, and 9 months, with no option term lasting more than a year. Options of this form, for such terms, still constitute the vast majority of options activity. LEAPS were created relatively recently and typically extend for terms of 2 years out. Equity LEAPS typically expire in January. For example, if today were November 2019, one could buy a Microsoft January call option that would expire in 2020, 2021, or 2022. The latter two are LEAPS. When LEAPS were first introduced in 1990, they were derivative instruments solely for stocks; however, more recently, equivalent instruments for indices have become available. These are also referred to as LEAPS. ==Applications== LEAPS are often used as a risk reduction tool by investors. For example, in an article in Stocks, Futures and Options Magazine, Dan Haugh of PTI Securities & Futures suggests that stock investors can manage risk and price protection by considering purchase of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) and “..buying put protection on that ETF with LEAPS.\\" Diversification is not Enough,” Stocks, Futures and Options Magazine, June 2009 In the case of stocks, the risk reduction application is when the owner of the stock writes LEAPs on his holding. The owner of the stock essentially creates the LEAP. The result at the expiry of the LEAP can be determined from its exercise price. (LEAPs are written for a wide variety of exercise prices.) For a call LEAP, if the stock closes below the exercise price, the buyer of the LEAP has lost what he spent to buy the LEAP. If the close is higher than the exercise price, the LEAP typically will automatically be exercised by the broker. The buyer can then sell the stock. His cost of the stock to the LEAP buyer will be the cost of the LEAP plus the exercise price (and any commissions). Most often the buyer of the LEAP is a speculator who hopes that the stock will rise enough in market price for him to make a profit when the LEAP expires. ==See also== * Option (finance) ==External links== * Long-term Equity AnticiPation Securities (LEAPS) at CBOE ==References== Category:Options (finance) ","title":"LEAPS (finance)"},{"id":"3240711","text":"The Centriscidae are a family of fishes from the order Syngnathiformes which includes the snipefishes, shrimpfishes, and bellowfishes.

The spiny part of the dorsal fin is located close to the tail and is made of one long, sharp spine at the anterior end with two shorter spines behind that. The soft, posterior part of the dorsal fin and the caudal fin are situated on the ventral surface and lie below the posterior-most part of the body, which is pointed. The pelvic fins are small and are located around the middle of its body while the pectoral fins are larger. The body is almost completely covered in thin, translucent bony plates which are created by expansion of its vertebrae. The species within this family do not have a lateral line. These fish tend to swim with their heads pointed towards the substrate, although why they do this is unclear. Some species occur within beds of sea grass while other species are reef fishes.

Although the XA-41 was a potent weapons system, the design was overtaken by more advanced technology, and never entered production. ==Design and development== The Vultee engineering team decided early in the design process to build the XA-41 (company Model 90) around the 3,000 hp Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major four-row, 28-cylinder radial engine. The Model 90's large wing resembled that of Vultee Model 72 – a two-seat attack aircraft/dive bomber better known as the Vultee Vengeance (A-31/A-35) – including a straight leading edge, forward-tapered trailing edge, and pronounced dihedral on the outer wing panels. Designed to carry both a large internal load and external stores, the XA-41 was large for a single-engine aircraft. The single-place cockpit, set in line with the wing root, was 15 ft (4.6 m) off the ground when the airplane was parked. As operational priorities shifted during its development phase, the original order for two XA-41 prototypes was cancelled, although the USAAF pressed for the completion of one prototype as an engine testbed for the R-4360 (the same engine used by the Boeing B-50 Superfortress). ==Operational history== Flying for the first time on 11 February 1944, the sole XA-41 (S/N 43-35124) proved to have good performance with a maximum speed of 354 mph reached in testing and \\"superb maneuverability, being able to out-turn a P-51B Mustang\\".Thompson 1992, p. 119. However, with the reduction in military orders due to the approaching end of the war, no production contract was placed, and the aircraft was used as an engine testbed for the USAAF as well as being evaluated by the U.S. Navy in comparison with other contemporary attack aircraft, especially the Douglas AD-1 Skyraider and Martin AM-1 Mauler. After its Navy trials, the XA-41, bearing civil registration NX60373N, was consigned to the Pratt & Whitney division of United Aircraft to continue engine tests. These continued until 1950 before the XA-41 was scrapped. ==Specifications (Vultee XA-41)== ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * McCullough, Anson. \\"Grind 'Em Out Ground Attack: The Search for the Elusive Fighter Bomber\\".

Dish is a part of cookbook for women with Gestational diabetes. A \\"low fat\\" child's meal from Burger King, with \\"apple fries\\" replacing fried potato chips, and a serving of macaroni and cheese as its main dish Diet food (or dietetic food) refers to any food or beverage whose recipe is altered to reduce fat, carbohydrates, and/or sugar in order to make it part of a weight loss program or diet. Such foods are usually intended to assist in weight loss or a change in body type, although bodybuilding supplements are designed to aid in gaining weight or muscle. ==Terminology== In addition to diet other words or phrases are used to identify and describe these foods including light, zero calorie, low calorie, low fat, no fat and sugar free. In some areas use of these terms may be regulated by law. For example, in the U.S. a product labeled as \\"low fat\\" must not contain more than 3 grams of fat per serving; and to be labeled \\"fat free\\" it must contain less than 0.5 grams of fat per serving.Definitions of Nutrient Content Claims, U.S. Food and Drug Administration ==Process== The process of making a diet version of a food usually requires finding an acceptable low- food-energy substitute for some high-food-energy ingredient. This can be as simple as replacing some or all of the food's sugar with a sugar substitute as is common with diet soft drinks such as Coca-Cola (for example Diet Coke). In some snacks, the food may be baked instead of fried thus reducing the food energy. In other cases, low-fat ingredients may be used as replacements. If you are doing on a low-fat diet, there are many benefit in this diet. Low-fat diets can help you lose weight by using calories on more filling food, and ward off serious medical conditions, including heart disease, high cholesterol, and diabetes. In whole grain foods, the higher fiber content effectively displaces some of the starch component of the flour. Since certain fibers have no food energy, this results in a modest energy reduction. Another technique relies on the intentional addition of other reduced-food-energy ingredients, such as resistant starch or dietary fiber, to replace part of the flour and achieve a more significant energy reduction. == Example of low-fat foods == The low-fat foods are those that have 30% of their calories or less from fats. So, if a food contains fewer than 3 gram of fat per 100 calories, it is a low fat food. Examples of cereals, grain, and pasta products are corn or whole wheat tortillas, oatmeal, backed cracker, whole grain versions of noodles, and pita bread. Examples of protein sources are beans, lentils, tofu, egg white, tuna, and peas. On the other hand, polysaturated such as omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids can be beneficial to the body. Nutritious foods are avocado, almond, salmon, cashews, seeds, and walnuts. ==Controversy== In diet foodsDiet and good food, National Health Service which replace the sugar with lower-food-energy substitutes, there is some controversy based around the possibility that the sugar substitutes used to replace sugar are themselves harmful. Artificial sweeteners have been the subject of intense scrutiny for decades, but according to the National Cancer Institute and other health agencies, there is no sound scientific evidence that any of the artificial sweeteners approved for use in the U.S. cause cancer or other serious health problems. Numerous research studies confirm that artificial sweeteners are generally safe in limited quantities, even for pregnant women. In many low-fat and fat-free foods the fat is replaced with sugar, flour, or other full-food- energy ingredients, and the reduction in food energy value is small, if any.Fat-Free vs. Regular Calorie Comparison, U.S. Food and Drug Administration ==See also== *Negative-calorie food *Olestra *Online weight loss plans *Obesity paradox ==References== Category:Diets ","title":"Diet food"},{"id":"3240729","text":"Olavi Uusivirta at Provinssirock in 2006 Olavi Uusivirta (born July 28, 1983 in Helsinki, Finland) is a Finnish rock/pop singer, songwriter and actor. == Childhood and education == Before his school years Uusivirta moved with his parents first to Kotka and later to Karkkila due to his mother's work. At the end of elementary school he started guitar and piano lessons. He also attended art classes and a theatre club that his mother directed. In 1995 he attended the Mustikkamaa midsummer festival in Helsinki where young Uusivirta saw Ismo Alanko perform. This performance inspired him and guided his life more towards music and performing. He also attended Ruisrock in Turku in 1996. In the years 1997-1998 he also attended the Roskilde Rock Festival in Roskilde, Denmark. When his family moved back to Helsinki in 1996 he started at the Kruununhaka secondary school in a music oriented class. At the end of his secondary school years his main instrument was drums, but slowly he grew more interest in singing. He and his friends also had a cover-band in which he sung in. During his high school years his cousin Jiri Kuronen encouraged him to try songwriting and asked him to provide lyrics to the songs he wrote. Inspired, Uusivirta started to write his own songs. He graduated from Kallio upper secondary school of the performing arts in 2002 and wrote a recording contract with Universal Music in the spring of his senior year. In 2002 while working on his first album, Uusivirta auditioned for the Helsinki Theatre Academy and got into the last stage of auditions but didn't get in. He tried a second time in 2005 with the same result and got in on his third try in 2006. He graduated with a master's degree in acting in 2012. == Career and productions == === Musician === Uusivirta released his first album Nuoruustango at 20 years old. \\"Raivo Härkä\\", a single from that album was also featured in Bad Boys (Pahat Pojat in Finnish) a 2003 movie by Aleksi Mäkelä. Two years later in 2005 Uusivirta released his second album titled Me ei kuolla koskaan, which sold gold nationally. From the album, two songs became radio hits: ”On niin helppoo olla onnellinen\\" and \\"Me ei kuolla koskaan\\". In spring 2008 his third album Minä olen hullu was released. His fourth album Preeria was released in April 2010. Apart from CD's, Uusivirta also sold special, limited edition vinyl records of the album. Only 300 were made and they featured a photograph signed by Uusivirta. In 2012 Uusivirta released his fifth album, a folk inspired record Elvis istuu oikealla. In February 2013 a bunch of the singer's hit songs and tracks were assembled onto a compilation album 27 suosikkia (27 favourites). The album also featured five unreleased tracks. His album Ikuiset lapset was released in February 2014 and another album Olavi two years later in 2016. Uusivirta won the best rock album of the year award in 2016 at the Finnish music awards Emma gaala with his album Olavi. Uusivirta also worked as a second drummer in the Finnish pop band Soma. He also sang the role of the Shepherd (Paimen) in the two-part theme album Pisara ja lammas by Absoluuttinen Nollapiste in 2012 and 2014. === Acting and TV === In spring 2002 Uusivirta played the drug dealer \\"Neppe\\" in a couple episodes of a Finnish drama series Salatut Elämät. Uusivirta hosted Zulu, a TV-series for youth together with actress Henna Vänninen on Yle TV2 in 2003–2004. Yle would have liked to continue the program, but Uusivirta wanted to focus more on music and theatre. Since his appearance on the program Uusivirta has been asked to take part in many other music related programs but he has declined each one of them as his interests are really not on TV. Uusivirta's first big role as an actor was in Keisarikunta, a movie by director Pekka Mandart. The movie premiered in 2004 and Uusivirta played the role of Toni Wahlström. He also wrote and sung the movie's signature theme, \\"Ei oltu niin kuin muut\\". Uusivirta played the role of Cisse Häkkinen in a 2007 movie Ganes about the Hurriganes. Uusivirta also took part in the movies Forbidden Fruit (Kielletty hedelmä) and Rally On! (Ralliraita), both premiering in 2009. He also tried voice acting dubbing in a Finnish version of the Danish animation Disco ormene, Discomadot in Finnish in 2008. In 2010 Uusivirta played Rauli Badding Somerjoki in a radio musical Rakkaudella, Rauli Badding produced by Radioteatteri. The musical was played on Yle Radio Suomi in the summer. === Other work === Uusivirta announced the recipient of the 2019 Finlandia Junior Award for the best children's book. The award went to Marisha Rasi-Koskinen for her title Auringon pimeä puoli. == Personal life == Uusivirta supports left-wing politics.

The tribal population in India, although a small minority, represents an enormous diversity of groups. They vary in language and linguistic traits, ecological settings in which they live, physical features, size of the population, the extent of acculturation, dominant modes of making a livelihood, level of development and social stratification. They are also spread over the length and breadth of the country though their geographical distribution is far from uniform. A majority of the Scheduled Tribe population is concentrated in the eastern, central and western belt covering the nine States of Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. About 12 percent inhabit the North-eastern region, about five percent in the Southern region and about three percent in the Northern States. ==Northwest India== The Tribal Belt of Northwest and east India includes the states of Rajasthan and Gujarat. The tribal people of this region have origins which precede the arrival of the Ancestral North Indians and are linked to the Ancestral South Indians. These people are thought to stem back to the Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley, the oldest traceable civilization of the Indian subcontinent which flourished between 3500BC and 2500BC. The tribes of north-west India were once strongly matrilineal societies. The changing fates and fortunes of these people has caused a gradual evolution to a more patriarchal code of living. These days the tribal societies generally follow the rule of patriliny, but there remain many examples of organised matriarchy in existence in the tribal zones to this day. It is the women who organise matters such as relationships and marriages, the inheritance of land, and the distribution of wealth. == South Gujarat Tribal Belt == Rupugad Fort The Southern Tribal Belt, popularly known as Dang, a forbidden territory covered with thick forests in the region of the South Gujarat. Located on the foothills of the Sahyadri range of mountains, it has green pastures, narrow roads, deep valleys, and wild animals.

It was released in 2005 on Columbia Records, making it their only release on a major label. This album is one of the albums known to be affected by Extended Copy Protection. This is the last album with all five original members. Before Phil Pirrone and Nate linderman left to form Casket Salesmen as well as the departure of former drummer Brett Dinovo. The album was originally to be titled \\"Watch the Sunlight Burn\\", but was changed prior to its release. A music video was created for the song \\"Stand Up\\". ==Background== Shortly after the release of their debut, ...And Don't Forget to Breathe, the band was signed to major label Columbia Records. The song \\"Radio Flyer's Last Journey\\" originally appeared on the band's self-titled demo EP, released in 2001. ==Reception== Faso Latido was generally met with negative feedback. The band treats this album just like Weezer's Pinkerton and the members of the band openly admit they dislike this album. When playing songs from the album live, they apologize to the fans for playing the song. However, many fans cite this album as the best from A Static Lullaby. Absolute Punk reviewer Scott Weber was very critical of the album, particularly for the high amounts of clean singing. Weber said the screams in \\"Stand Up\\" were awkward and out of place with the \\"laid back musicianship\\" and the song sounded like any other radio song with screaming. He did however praise the song \\"Radio Flyer's Last Journey\\" for its energy. A more positive review came from Melodic.net's Kaj Roth. Roth commented on the more commercial and melodic sound of the album, and said fans of the debut ...And Don't Forget to Breathe would be very disappointed. Roth concluded by saying the band's energy and attitude make up for the change in sound, but said the album doesn't have many stand out tracks. Another positive review came from Allmusic. The reviewer praised \\"Radio Flyer's Last Journey\\" for its chugging guitar riffs and \\"Half Man, Half Shark; Equals One Complete Gentleman\\" for use of a delay-pedal. Another praise was the band's lyrical content, which was different from \\"the usual emo notebook romance\\". Though the album received lukewarm reception from both fans and critics, Faso Latido is the band's highest charting album on the Billboard 200, charting at no. 129. ==Track listing== All lyrics written by Joe Brown and Dan Arnold, all music composed by A Static Lullaby ==Personnel== * Joe Brown - unclean vocals * Dan Arnold - clean vocals, piano, programming, keyboards, rhythm guitar * Nate Lindeman - lead guitar * Phil Pirrone - bass guitar, backing vocals * Brett Dinovo - drums, percussion ==References== Category:A Static Lullaby albums Category:2005 albums Category:Columbia Records albums Category:Albums produced by Lou Giordano ","title":"Faso Latido"},{"id":"3240789","text":"Red fringe trim on a woman's dress c. 1870. Elaborate gold metallic lace trim c. 1760-65. Trim or trimming in clothing and home decorating is applied ornament, such as gimp, passementerie, ribbon, ruffles, or, as a verb, to apply such ornament. Before the industrial revolution, all trim was made and applied by hand, thus making heavily trimmed furnishings and garments expensive and high-status. Machine-woven trims and sewing machines put these dense trimmings within the reach of even modest dressmakers and home sewers, and an abundance of trimming is a characteristic of mid-Victorian fashion.Tozer, Jane and Sarah Levitt, Fabric of Society: A Century of People and their Clothes 1770-1870, Laura Ashley Press, As a predictable reaction, high fashion came to emphasize exquisiteness of cut and construction over denseness of trimming, and applied trim became a signifier of mass-produced clothing by the 1930s.Hawes, Elizabeth Fashion is Spinach, Random House, 1938 The iconic braid and gold button trim of the Chanel suit are a notable survival of trim in high fashion. In home decorating, the 1980s and 1990s saw a fashion for dense, elaborately layered trimmings on upholstered furniture and drapery. Today, most trimmings are commercially manufactured. Scalamandré is known for elaborate trim for home furnishings, and Wrights is a leading manufacturer of trim for home sewing and crafts. Conso is another leading manufacturer. Trims are used generally to enhance the beauty of the garments. It attracts buyers.

The Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment states that training to failure is necessary for maximal hypertrophic response.Page 124 in: ==Resistance== A 2010 study concluded that training to failure with lower loads with more repetitions can be more beneficial for muscle building than using higher loads with fewer repetitions. In this study, participants who trained to failure with a weight equal to 30% of their single repetition maximum (1RM) had higher levels of muscle-building proteins 24 hours after their training session than participants who trained to failure with a weight that was 90% of their maximum.Low-Load High Volume Resistance Exercise Stimulates Muscle Protein Synthesis More Than High-Load Low Volume Resistance Exercise in Young Men ==Initial failure== When the athlete has reached initial failure (i.e. fails to perform a further repetition), the exercise can be continued by making the exercise easier (change of posture, switching to lower weight) or by recruiting help (from a spotting partner or by involving another body part). == Repetition Maximum (RM) == Determining a repetition maximum (such as 1RM) must be done to true failure, so this also can be considered a form of training to failure. Though 1RM is the most popular and commonly used, any number of repetitions can be used, for instance a 10RM or 15RM. A 10RM weight is more useful in terms of training for hypertrophy than a 1RM. There is less consensus as to why a 1RM is actually safer; it may be because a 1RM can be performed with a much lower risk of joint injury (due to the lower weight), but also potentially because failure occurs due to absolute inability of the muscles to perform at the attempted weight (rather than due to fatigue). A 10RM would be the weight at which a person can do 10 repetitions, but fail to fully perform the 11th. == Types of failure == There are multiple types of failure that can be reached before ending a set. They are listed here in order of increasing intensity. * Pre-failure. The set is ended just before failure, as judged based on sensory feedback from the muscles. * Tempo failure. The tempo or cadence used for the initial few repetitions can no longer be maintained. Additional repetitions cannot be performed at the same tempo. * Form failure. Proper form or technique for repetitions can no longer be maintained. Additional repetitions cannot be performed using proper form. * Absolute failure. No additional repetitions can be performed, even with poor form. Training to form failure or absolute failure is potentially harmful and should be used sparingly, usually only for determining Repetition Max. Beginners should train to pre-failure or tempo failure, while focusing on maintaining proper form. == Stages of failure in high-intensity training == High-intensity training (HIT) is a form of strength training that involves brief, infrequent, intense workouts at a low volume of repetitions and sets. HIT distinguishes three stages of muscle failure. The first stage consists of normal repetitions performed in a slow, controlled manner until no further repetitions can be completed (failure). The second stage consists of a controlled static hold until failure. The third stage consists of negative repetitions performed in a slow, controlled manner until failure. After all three stages of failure are reached the muscle is considered thoroughly exhausted and the set is complete. == References == Category:Weight training ","title":"Training to failure"},{"id":"3240797","text":"Avitus is a cognomen used by various Romans of Imperial times.

He was born in Östergötland and was at one time chairman of the Moderate Youth League district there. He studied law in Uppsala 1968–71. In 1971, he was elected national chairman of the Moderate Youth League and served until 1976, when he was elected to the Riksdag for Östergötland. In 1986, he became secretary general of the Moderate Party. He stayed in the post until 1991, when the Moderate Party won the election and Carl Bildt became Prime Minister of Sweden. Unckel was then appointed Minister of Education. In that position, he spearheaded the educational reforms that revolutionised the Swedish education system. Among other things, students were allowed to choose among the local schools. After the loss in the election in 1994, Unckel became the party spokesman on labour policy. In 1998 he became chairman of the Committee on the Constitution and one year later he was appointed leader of the Moderate Party parliamentary group. The election in 2002 was disastrous for the Moderate Party and several senior figures had to resign from the board of the party. Per Unckel was one of them. He was seen as a part of the old regime - the so-called \\"Bunker\\" around Carl Bildt, together with the likes of Anders Björk and Gunnar Hökmark. His old Moderate Youth League district, however, paid their respects by electing him honorary chairman. In 2003, he was appointed secretary-general of the Nordic Council of Ministers and retired from Swedish politics. He served until December 2006. He later served as the Chairman of the Governing Board of the European Humanities University.

The perihelion of 5D/Brorsen was February 25, just a day before its discovery, and it passed closest to Earth on March 27, at a distance of 0.52 AU. As a result of this close encounter to Earth the comet's coma diameter increased. Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt estimated it as 3 to 4 arcminutes across on March 9, and 8 to 10 arcminutes across on the 22nd of that same month. On April 22, it was about 20 degrees from the north celestial pole. By the end of this first apparition the orbital period was calculated as 5.5 years. It was discovered that a close approach to Jupiter in 1842 put it in its discovery orbit. The comet's 5.5-year period would mean that apparitions would alternate between good and poor. As expected, the comet was missed in its 1851 apparition, when it only came as close as 1.5 AU to Earth. The comet's orbit was still relatively uncertain, made worse by its approach to Jupiter in 1854. Karl Christian Bruhns found a comet on 18 March 1857. Soon an orbit was computed and it was found to be 5D/Brorsen, although predictions were three months off. The comet was followed until June 1857, and the orbit was then well established. Observers reported that the comet had a bright, almost star-like nucleus. The comet was missed in 1862, and the next recovery was in 1868. A close approach to Jupiter shortened the period enough to make the comet visible in 1873. A very favorable apparition followed in 1879, allowing the comet to be observed for the longest time to date – four months. The comet was missed in 1884, due to observing circumstances, but was also missed in 1890, a favorable apparition. The next favorable apparition occurred in 1901, but searches did not locate the comet. The next serious search was started by Brian G. Marsden in 1963, who believed the comet had faded out of existence, but computed the orbit for a very favorable 1973 apparition. Japanese observers made intensive searches for the comet, but nothing turned up. This failure to locate the comet, in conjunction with earlier attempts, lead Marsden to conclude that the comet was lost. == References == # Orbital data taken from this preprint: Neslusan, Lubos: \\"The identification of asteroid 1996 SK with the extinct nucleus of comet 5D/Brorsen\\", Memorie della Società Astronomica Italiana, Spec.

Due to its lack of on-site lodging, Loveland often has shorter lift lines and less- expensive lift tickets, particularly midweek. ==Loveland Basin== Loveland Basin is the windiest of the two areas that compose Loveland Ski Area. It contains most of the runs and lifts in the ski area, including all of the \\"Most Difficult\\" and \\"Expert\\" terrain. Eight of the ten chairlifts are located in the Basin. The bottom of the mountain contains the Basin Lodge. The basin lodge is a building that contains the Loveland Grill, as well as a Deli, and two bars. There are also many cabins on the mountain, which contain both warming huts and some are food service. All have propane grills and heated insides. The historic E-Tow Cabin is one of these, which was the site of the original E-Tow Lift. Most can be rented out. Image:Loveland Ridge.jpgView of the ridge above Loveland Ski Area.

Image:The Ridge at Loveland Basin.pngViews of The Ridge from the top of chair 9 at Loveland Basin. ==Loveland Valley Ski Area== Loveland Valley is geared toward beginners. It has two chair lifts, Chair 3, which serves its intermediate and racing runs, and Chair 7, which exclusively serves its beginner slopes, All Smiles and Take Off. Generally, its slopes are gentler which suits itself well to be the home of Loveland’s Ski and Ride School. Loveland Valley has a lodge building that consists of a cafeteria, bar, the Ski and Ride School office, a ticket office, a rental shop, lockers, hygiene services and a retail area. Loveland Race Club is also located within the Valley. The Club practices and races at the upper end of the Valley’s Switchback Trail. Practices are held every afternoon and races are held on the weekend. The Club also has a lodge just below the base of Chair 3.Loveland Racing Club There is a big race that happens at Loveland Valley every year called the Loveland Derby that is put on by the Loveland Race Club. ==Ski patrol== Loveland has a combination volunteer and paid patrol that services the mountain and leads the way for other volunteer patrols with their extensive camaraderie. It is one of the few patrols in the Rocky Mountain Division that has an active young adult program, who share the same responsibilities as their adult compatriots. ==History== Loveland was first opened as a ski area in 1936 by J.C. Blickensderfer, who installed a portable tow rope in what is now Loveland Basin. The following year, operations were taken over by Al Bennett who used a modified Model T to power the tow. In 1941 the area was named Loveland Ski Tow Inc. and through the 1940s the area grew to boast 4 tows. Many changes occurred during the 1950s and 1960s which made the area much more accessible. In 1955, Loveland Ski Tow Inc. was purchased by stockholders and Pete Seibert, the future co-founder of the Vail Ski Resort, was hired as General Manager. Loveland's first chairlift, Chair 1, opened in 1955. Chair 2 was added in 1957, as was the Mambo Café, which was situated near the base of what is now Chair 4. Chairs 3 and 4 were also constructed during the 1960s. Loveland saw the construction of the Eisenhower Tunnel beginning in 1968, with tunnel openings in 1973 and 1979. The owner Upham and Loveland general manager Otto Werlin conceived the idea of artificial snow from observing the pumps and compressors being used to dig the tunnel. The 1980s and 1990s brought about several upgrades to existing equipment. In 1984, snowmaking capabilities were installed. In 1985, Chair 2 was upgraded to a triple chairlift. The late 1980s also saw the construction of expanded lodge facilities at the Valley area. Lift 8, a fixed grip quad, was installed to access intermediate and advanced terrain in 1990. In 1995, the Basin’s lodge was remodeled and expanded. Lift #3 was replaced in 1996 with a fixed grip quad. 1998 saw the installation of another fixed grip quad, Lift #9, which provided access to \\"The Ridge\\".Colorado Ski HistoryLoveland Ski Patrol History Prior to Breckenridge Ski Resort's construction of the Imperial Express SuperChair in 2005, Lift 9 was the highest offloading chairlift in North America. In 2011, the aging Lift 4 was replaced with a triple chairlift. The E Tow Cabin was removed. For 2015, Lift 2 was split in half, and it was shortened to end at its midstation. The upper section of the lift was replaced with a new fixed grip quad called Ptarmigan, running in the alignment of the former platter. In 2018, Lift 1 (a fixed-grip triple installed in 1981) was replaced by a Leitner-Poma high speed quad, named \\"Chet's Dream\\". ===Proposed Olympic venue=== When the International Olympic Committee awarded the 1976 Winter Olympics to Denver in May 1970, the local organizers' proposal included the development of Mount Sniktau as the primary venue for alpine ski racing for downhill and giant slalom, with slalom at Loveland Ski Area. By early 1972, it was decided to move the alpine events to Vail because the proposals did not meet the Olympic standards. After the Colorado voters, in November, rejected public funding for the Olympics, it was relocated to Innsbruck, Austria. ===Plane crash=== On a clear Friday afternoon in early October 1970, a chartered airplane carrying half of the Wichita State University football team crashed just northeast of the ski area. A total of forty were on board and only nine survived; the cause was attributed to several pilot errors. First respondors were motorists (I-70/US-6) and construction workers at the Eisenhower Tunnel. ==ReferencesMySpace.com - Loveland * 3dSkiMaps.com - Loveland Ski Area - 3-D map * New #4 Chair Development Category:Buildings and structures in Clear Creek County, Colorado Category:Ski areas and resorts in Colorado Category:Tourist attractions in Clear Creek County, Colorado ","title":"Loveland Ski Area"},{"id":"3240908","text":"The cornetfishes or flutemouthsFishes of Australia, FISTULARIIDAE Flutemouths (Museum Victoria) are a small family, the Fistulariidae, of extremely elongated fishes in the order Syngnathiformes.

They usually exist in unspoken and unwritten format because they form a part of the logical argument or course of action implied by tacit assumptions. Examples involving unspoken rules include unwritten and unofficial organizational hierarchies, organizational culture, and acceptable behavioral norms governing interactions between organizational members. For example, the captain of a ship is always expected to be the last to evacuate it in a disaster. Or, as Vince Waldron wrote, \\"A pet, once named, instantly becomes an inseparable member of the family.\\"Vince Waldron, The Official Dick Van Dyke Show Book, Hal Leonard, 2001, p. 176. ==Employment and discrimination== In the workplace, some unspoken rules can have a significant impact on one’s job satisfaction, advancement opportunities, and career trajectory.

Barrel refers to the cylindrical shape of the cylinder group (result of the pistons being spaced evenly around the central crankshaft and aligned parallel to the crankshaft axis) whilst the Z-crank alludes to the shape of the crankshaft. The key advantage of the axial design is that the cylinders are arranged in parallel around the output/crank shaft in contrast to radial and inline engines, both types having cylinders at right angles to the shaft. As a result, it is a very compact, cylindrical engine, allowing variation in compression ratio of the engine while running. In a swashplate engine the piston rods stay parallel with the shaft, and piston side-forces that cause excessive wear can be eliminated almost completely. The small-end bearing of a traditional connecting rod, one of the most problematic bearings in a traditional engine, is eliminated. An alternate design, the Rand cam engine, replaces the plate with one or more sinusoidal cam surfaces. Vanes mounted parallel to a shaft mounted inside a cylindrical 'barrel' that are free to sliding up and down ride the sinuous cam, the segments formed by rotor, stator walls and vanes constituting combustion chambers. In effect these spaces serving the same purpose as the cylinders of an axial engine, and the sinuous cam surface acts as the face of the pistons. In other respect this form follows the normal cycles of internal combustion but with burning gas directly imparting a force on the cam surface, translated into a rotational force by timing one or more detonations. This design eliminates the multiple reciprocal pistons, ball joints and swash plate of a conventional 'barrel' engine but crucially depends on effective sealing provided by sliding and rotating surfaces. In either form the axial or 'barrel' engine can be derived as a cam engine or swashplate or wobble plate engine. (A wobble-plate is similar to a swash plate, in that the pistons press down on the plate in sequence, imparting a lateral moment that is translated into rotary motion. This motion can be simulated by placing a compact disc on a ball bearing at its centre and pressing down at progressive places around its circumference. The difference is that while a wobble plate nutates, a swash-plate rotates.) While axial engines are challenging to make practicable at typical engine operating speeds some cam engines have been tested that offer extremely compact size (approximating to a six-inch (150mm) cube) yet producing approximately forty horsepower at c 7000 rpm, useful for light aerial applications. The attraction of lightweight and mechanically simple (far fewer major moving parts, in the form of a rotor plus twelve axial vanes forming twenty-four combustion chambers) engines, even with a finite working life, have obvious application for small unmanned aircraft. (Such a design having allegedly been tested at NAVAIR PSEF in 2003.) ==History== ===Macomber=== Swashplate animation. Note that the swashplate is fastened to the shaft, so it rotates with it. In 1911 the Macomber Rotary Engine Company of Los Angeles marketed one of the first axial internal-combustion engines, manufactured by the Avis Engine Company of Allston, Massachusetts. A four- stroke, air-cooled unit, it had seven cylinders and a variable compression ratio, altered by changing the wobble-plate angle and hence the length of piston stroke. It was called a \\"rotary engine\\", because the entire engine rotated apart from the end casings. Ignition was supplied by a Bosch magneto directly driven from the cam gears. The high voltage current was then taken to a fixed electrode on the front bearing case, from which the sparks would jump to the spark plugs in the cylinder heads as they passed within 1/16 inch (1.5 mm) from it. According to Macomber's literature, it was \\"guaranteed not to overheat\\". The engine was claimed to be able to run at 150 to 1,500 rpm. At the normal speed of 1,000 rpm, it reportedly developed 50 hp. It weighed and it was long by in diameter. Pioneer aviator Charles Francis Walsh flew an aircraft powered by a Macomber engine in May 1911, the \\"Walsh Silver Dart\\". ===Statax=== In 1913 Statax-Motor of Zürich, Switzerland introduced a swashplate engine design. Only a single prototype was produced, which is currently held in the Science Museum, London. In 1914 the company moved to London to become the Statax Engine Company and planned on introducing a series of rotary engines; a 3-cylinder of 10 hp, a 5-cylinder of 40 hp, a 7-cylinder of 80 hp, and a 10-cylinder of 100 hp. It appears only the 40 hp design was ever produced, which was installed in a Caudron G.II for the British 1914 Aerial Derby but was withdrawn before the flight. Hansen introduced an all- aluminum version of this design in 1922, but it is not clear if they produced it in any quantity. Much improved versions were introduced by Statax's German division in 1929, producing 42 hp in a new sleeve valve version known as the 29B. Greenwood and Raymond of San Francisco acquired the patent rights for the US, Canada, and Japan, and planned a 5-cylinder of 100 hp and a 9-cylinder of 350 hp. ===Michell=== In 1917 Anthony Michell obtained patents for his swashplate engine design. Its unique feature was the means of transferring the load from the pistons to the swashplate, achieved using tilting slipper pads sliding on a film of oil. Another innovation by Michell was his mathematical analysis of the mechanical design, including the mass and motion of the components, so that his engines were in perfect dynamic balance at all speeds. In 1920 Michell established the Crankless Engines Company in Fitzroy (Australia), and produced working prototypes of pumps, compressors, car engines and aero engines, all based on the same basic design. Engine designer Phil Irving worked for the Crankless Engine Company before his time at HRD. A number of companies obtained a manufacturing license for Michell’s design. The most successful of these was the British company Waller and Son, who produced gas boosters. The largest Michell crankless engine was the XB-4070, a diesel aircraft engine built for the United States Navy. Consisting of 18 pistons, it was rated at 2000 horsepower and weighed 2150 pounds. ===John O. Almen=== Experimental barrel engines for aircraft use were built and tested by American John O. Almen of Seattle, Washington in the early 1920s, and by the mid-1920s the water-cooled Almen A-4 (18 cylinders, two groups of nine each horizontally-opposed) had passed its United States Army Air Corps acceptance tests. However, it never entered production, reportedly due to limited funds and the Air Corps' growing emphasis on air-cooled radial engines. The A-4 had much smaller frontal area than water-cooled engines of comparable power output, and thereby offered better streamlining possibilities. It was rated at 425 horsepower (317 kW), and weighed only 749 pounds (340 kg), thus giving a power/weight ratio of better than 1:2, a considerable design achievement at the time. ===Heraclio Alfaro=== Heraclio Alfaro Fournier was a Spanish aviator who was knighted at the age of 18 by King Alfonso XIII of Spain for designing, building, and flying Spain's first airplane. He developed a barrel engine for aircraft use which was later produced by the Indian Motocycle Manufacturing Company as the Alfaro. It was a perfect example of the \\"put in everything\\" design, as it included a sleeve valve system based on a rotating cylinder head, a design that never entered production on any engine. It was later developed further for use in the Doman helicopter by Stephen duPont, son of the president of the Indian Motorcycle Company, who had been one of Alfaro's students at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ===Bristol=== The Bristol Axial Engine of the mid-1930s was designed by Charles Benjamin Redrup for the Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company; it was a 7-litre, 9-cylinder, wobble- plate type engine. It was originally conceived as a power unit for buses, possibly because its compact format would allow it to be installed beneath the vehicle's floor. The engine had a single rotary valve to control induction and exhaust. Several variants were used in Bristol buses during the late 1930s, the engine going through several versions from RR1 to RR4, which had a power output of 145 hp at 2900 rpm. Development was halted in 1936 following a change of management at the Bristol company. ===Wooler=== Perhaps the most refined of the designs was the British Wooler wobble-plate engine of 1947. This 6-cylinder engine was designed by John Wooler, better known as a motorcycle engine designer, for aircraft use. It was similar to the Bristol axial engine but had two wobble-plates, driven by 12 opposed pistons in 6 cylinders. The engine is often incorrectly referred to as a swashplate engine. A single example is preserved in the Aeroplane Gallery of the Science Museum, London. ===H.L.F. Trebert=== Some small barrel engines were produced by the H.L.F. Trebert Engine Works of Rochester, New York for marine usage. ==Present day== ===Dyna-Cam=== The Dyna-Cam engine originally came from a design by the Blazer brothers, two American engineers in the brass era automotive industry who worked for Studebaker in 1916. They sold the rights to Karl Herrmann, Studebaker's head of engineering, who developed the concept over many years, eventually taking out US patent 2237989 in 1941. It has 6 double-ended pistons working in 6 cylinders, and its 12 combustion chambers are fired every revolution of the drive shaft. The pistons drive a sine-shaped cam, as opposed to a swashplate or wobble-plate, hence its name. In 1961, at the age of 80, Herrmann sold the rights to one of his employees, Edward Palmer, who set up the Dyna-Cam Engine Corp. along with son Dennis. Edward's son Dennis and daughter Pat then helped get the engine installed in a Piper Arrow airplane. The engine was flown for about 700 hours from 1987 through 1991. Their longest-life engine ran for nearly 4000 hours before overhaul. Dyna-Cam opened a research and development facility about 1993 and won many various awards from NASA, the United States Navy, the United States Marine Corps, California Energy Commission, Air Quality Management District, and Los Angeles Regional Technology Alliance for different variations of the same Dyna-Cam engine. About 40 prototype engines were built by the Herrmann Group and another 25 built by the Dyna-Cam Group since they acquired the engine and opened their shop. A new patent was granted to Dennis Palmer and Edward Palmer, first in 1985 and then several more around 2000 to Dennis Palmer. In 2003 the assets of the Dyna-Cam Engine Corporation were acquired by Aero-Marine Corporation, who changed their name to Axial Vector Engine Corporation. Axial Vector then totally re-designed the cam engine. Axial Vector's new engine, like many of the others on this list, suffers from the \\"put in everything\\" problem, including piezoelectric valves and ignition, ceramic cylinder liners with no piston rings, and a variety of other advanced features. It has little similarity to the original Herrmann and Dyna-Cam engines, since the Dyna-Cam engine used conventional valves, piston rings, accessories, had no unproven ceramic materials and actually flew in an aircraft and also powered a \\"Eliminator\\" ski boat for over four years. ===Covaxe=== United Kingdom company Covaxe Limited (known as FairDiesel Limited up until 2017) is designing two- stroke Diesel opposed piston barrel engines that use non-sinusoidal cams, for industrial applications and aviation use. Their engine designs range from a 2-cylinder, 80 mm bore to 32-cylinder, 160 mm bore. ===Duke Engines=== New Zealand company Duke Engines started in 1993 has created several different engines and installed one in a car in 1999. The engine runs a 5-cylinder, 3 litre, 4-stroke internal combustion engine platform with its unique axial arrangement, which is in its third generation. Due to a valveless design, Duke engine loses less energy between the power strokes. Current prototypes of Duke's engines claim to match characteristics of conventional internal combustion engines but with fewer parts and 30% lighter. This goes in the direction of developing a more efficient engine. During development the Duke has been tested at MAHLE Powertrain in the United Kingdom and in the United States; test results show that is has multi-fuel capabilities. The Duke engine's benefits of lightness and compactness should render this design ideal for motorcycles engines; and these benefits might make the powerplant suitablle for light aircraft as well. (There is little data on whether the Duke engine is smooth; the mainshaft has a large counterweight attached). ===Cylindrical Energy Module=== The Cylindrical Energy Module (CEM) is a sine- wave swashplate engine that can also be used as a standalone pump, powered by an external source. The rotating swashplate rotor assembly is moved back and forth with the help of piston drive pins, which follow a stationary sinusoidal cam track that encircles the rotor assembly. ==Applications== *The most well- known application is in torpedoes, where the cylindrical shape is desirable. The modern Mark 48 torpedo is powered by a 500 hp swashplate engine geared to a pump-jet propulsor. It is fueled by Otto fuel II, a monopropellant that requires no oxygen supply and can propel the torpedo at up to (74.56 mph). *Other applications include pneumatic and hydraulic motors, hydrostatic transmissions such as Honda's Hondamatic CVT, and air conditioner pumps. Also, some Stirling engines use a swashplate arrangement, e.g., Stirling Thermal Motors' STM 4-120 engine. ==See also== * Axial piston pump ==Notes== ==References== * * ==External links== *Barrel Engine - Part 2 Flight December 1941 Category:Engine technology Category:Piston engines ","title":"Axial engine"},{"id":"3240927","text":"Achaea is a subdivision of Greece.

The Pirates were the epitome of the game in Scotland during the 1950s. In season 1953–54 they won the Autumn Cup, the Scottish Cup and the Canada Cup. Their success brought them to the British National League, but local supporters could ill afford to travel to Southern England and gradually support waned. Both Pirates' junior team, Paisley Wildcats, followed by the Pirates themselves were dissolved. The Paisley Mohawks replaced them, but could not generate the enthusiasm of the Pirates. Paisley Buddies were delighted when the Pirates were relaunched in the 1990s with the opening of the new ice rink and started living up to past glories by winning Scottish Division One in their inaugural season. The following season Pirates joined British League Division One and after more league reconstruction a few seasons later joined British National League which was the start of tougher times for the Pirates, where they regularly finished out of play-off contention and close to the foot of the table. Former Aviemore Blues tough-guy/coach, Stirling Wright, was brought in from Swindon in the 1999–00 season. Local players, Bobby Chalmers, James Clarke, and O'Niell from the Pirates were selected to play for the GB junior team. Wright continued to play the home grown players more than the imports and this resulted in the imports pushing for Wright to resign. Wright met with the owner Allan Maxwell and resigned in February when he refused to reduce the playing time of the British/Scottish players. He was asked to return the next week but headed back to America. The team would not improve and the production dropped even more with many of the players leaving the club. With the costs of travel to the south of England, the Pirates could not afford to continue play in the British National League so in 2002 the club made the decision to transfer to the Scottish National League where they continue to play. During season 2006–07, the Pirates almost had to fold due to a problem with their home ice at Paisley's Lagoon centre. However, a late move to the nearby Braehead Arena secured their survival. In an eventful season, they secured the Scottish Spring Cup, beating Dundee Tigers in the final. After many ups and downs over the years the club was taken over by a group of supporters in 2010. The club was withdrawn from the (now defunct) SPHL during the 2009–10 season by the clubs then owner. The club joined the SNL Scottish National League. In 2020, a partnership with the Glasgow Clan of the EIHL was announced. This would see both clubs further strengthen their links, giving Pirates commercial and marketing support whilst providing a pathway to elite ice hockey for junior players in the Greater Glasgow area. ==Club roster 2020–21== { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"width:97%; clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text- align:center;\\" - ! colspan=\\"11\\" style=\\"background:silver; color:black;\\" Netminders - ddd;\\" !width=5%No. !width=5%Nat. !!width=22%Player !width=7%Catches !width=16%Date of birth !width=20%Place of birth !width=24%Acquired Contract } { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"width:97%; clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;\\" - ! colspan=\\"11\\" style=\\"background:silver; color:black;\\" Defencemen - ddd;\\" !width=5%No. !width=5%Nat. !!width=22%Player !width=7%Shoots !width=16%Date of birth !width=20%Place of birth !width=24%Acquired Contract - } {class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"width:97%; clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;\\" - ! colspan=\\"11\\" style=\\"background:silver; color:black;\\" Forwards - ddd;\\" !width=5%No. !width=5%Nat. !!width=22%Player !width=7%Shoots !width=16%Date of birth !width=20%Place of birth !width=24%Acquired Contract } ==2020/21 Outgoing== { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"width:97%; clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;\\" + - ! colspan=\\"11\\" style=\\"background:silver; color:black;\\"  Outgoing - ddd;\\" ! width=\\"5%\\" No. ! width=\\"5%\\" Nat. ! !width=\\"22%\\" Player ! width=\\"7%\\" Shoots ! width=\\"16%\\" Date of birth ! width=\\"20%\\" Place of birth ! width=\\"24%\\" Leaving For } ==References== == External links == * Official Website * Official Facebook Page * Official Twitter Page Category:Ice hockey teams in Scotland Category:Sport in Renfrewshire Category:1946 establishments in Scotland Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 1947 ","title":"Paisley Pirates"},{"id":"3240938","text":"Botteri's sparrow (Peucaea botterii) is a medium-sized sparrow. This passerine bird is primarily found in Mexico, with a breeding range that extends into the southeastern tip of the U.S. state of Arizona, and a small non-migratory population in the Rio Grande Valley of southern Texas, which is threatened by loss of habitat. It was not found in Arizona between the 1890s and the mid-20th century due to excessive grazing of livestock; now it is locally common in its Arizona range due to recovery of vegetation. Juvenile birds apparently need dense vegetation to hide in during fledging; the uncommon native sacaton grass Sporobolus wrightii is preferred, but stands of introduced non-native Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana) and Boer lovegrass (E. curvula var. conferta) are also successfully utilized, though at lower population densities.Jones, Zach F. & Bock, Carl E.

The flight test phase accomplishes two major tasks: 1) finding and fixing any design problems and then 2) verifying and documenting the vehicle capabilities for government certification or customer acceptance. The flight test phase can range from the test of a single new system for an existing vehicle to the complete development and certification of a new aircraft, launch vehicle, or reusable spacecraft. Therefore, the duration of a particular flight test program can vary from a few weeks to many years. ==Aircraft flight test== ===Civil aircraft=== There are typically two categories of flight test programs – commercial and military. Commercial flight testing is conducted to certify that the aircraft meets all applicable safety and performance requirements of the government certifying agency. In the US, this is the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); in Canada, Transport Canada (TC); in the United Kingdom (UK), the Civil Aviation Authority; and in the European Union, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Since commercial aircraft development is normally funded by the aircraft manufacturer and/or private investors, the certifying agency does not have a stake in the commercial success of the aircraft. These civil agencies are concerned with the aircraft's safety and that the pilot's flight manual accurately reports the aircraft's performance. The market will determine the aircraft's suitability to operators. Normally, the civil certification agency does not get involved in flight testing until the manufacturer has found and fixed any development issues and is ready to seek certification. ===Military aircraft=== Military programs differ from commercial in that the government contracts with the aircraft manufacturer to design and build an aircraft to meet specific mission capabilities. These performance requirements are documented to the manufacturer in the aircraft specification and the details of the flight test program (among many other program requirements) are spelled out in the statement of work. In this case, the government is the customer and has a direct stake in the aircraft's ability to perform the mission. Since the government is funding the program, it is more involved in the aircraft design and testing from early-on. Often military test pilots and engineers are integrated as part of the manufacturer's flight test team, even before first flight. The final phase of the military aircraft flight test is the Operational Test (OT). OT is conducted by a government-only test team with the dictate to certify that the aircraft is suitable and effective to carry out the intended mission. Flight testing of military aircraft is often conducted at military flight test facilities. The US Navy tests aircraft at Naval Air Station Patuxent River and the US Air Force at Edwards Air Force Base. The U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School and the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School are the programs designed to teach military test personnel. In the UK, most military flight testing is conducted by three organizations, the RAF, BAE Systems and QinetiQ. For minor upgrades the testing may be conducted by one of these three organizations in isolation, but major programs are normally conducted by a joint trials team (JTT), with all three organizations working together under the umbrella of an integrated project team (IPT) airspace. ==Atmospheric flight testing of launch vehicles and reusable spacecraft== controlled-descent flight test of the Falcon 9 first stage from stage separation onward, on Falcon 9 Flight 13, 21 September 2014. Includes footage as the first stage maneuvers out of the second stage plume; coasting near peak altitude of approximately ; boost-back burn to limit downrange translation; preparing for the reentry burn; and the reentry burn from approximately to altitude. Does not include the landing burn near the ocean surface as clouds obscured the infrared imaging at low altitude. All launch vehicles, as well as a few reusable spacecraft, must necessarily be designed to deal with aerodynamic flight loads while moving through the atmosphere. Many launch vehicles are flight tested, with rather more extensive data collection and analysis on the initial orbital launch of a particular launch vehicle design. Reusable spacecraft or reusable booster test programs are much more involved and typically follow the full envelope expansion paradigm of traditional aircraft testing. Previous and current test programs include the early drop tests of the Space Shuttle, the X-24B, SpaceShipTwo, Dream Chaser, Falcon 9 prototypes, OK-GLI, and SpaceX Starship prototypes. ==Flight test processes== Flight testing—typically as a class of non-revenue producing flight, although SpaceX has also done extensive flight tests on the post-mission phase of a returning booster flight on revenue launches—can be subject to the latter's statistically demonstrated higher risk of accidents or serious incidents. This is mainly due to the unknowns of a new aircraft or launch vehicle's handling characteristics and lack of established operating procedures, and can be exacerbated if test pilot training or experience of the flight crew is lacking For this reason, flight testing is carefully planned in three phases: preparation; execution; and analysis and reporting. ===Preparation=== For both commercial and military aircraft, as well as launch vehicles, flight test preparation begins well before the test vehicle is ready to fly. Initially what needs to be tested must be defined, from which the Flight Test Engineers prepare the test plan, which is essentially certain maneuvers to be flown (or systems to be exercised). Each single test is known as a Test Point. A full certification/qualification flight test program for a new aircraft will require testing for many aircraft systems and in-flight regimes; each is typically documented in a separate test plan. Altogether, a certification flight test program will consist of approximately 10,000 Test Points. The document used to prepare a single test flight for an aircraft is known as a Test Card. This will consist of a description of the Test Points to be flown. The flight test engineer will try to fly similar Test Points from all test plans on the same flights, where practical. This allows the required data to be acquired in the minimum number of flight hours. The software used to control the flight test process is known as Flight Test Management Software, and supports the Flight Test Engineer in planning the test points to be flown as well as generating the required documentation. Static pressure probe on the nose of a Sukhoi Superjet 100 prototype 747-8I prototype Static pressure probe rig aboard Boeing 747-8I prototype; A long tube, rolled up inside the barrel, is connected to a probe which can be deployed far behind the tail of the aircraft Once the flight test data requirements are established, the aircraft or launch vehicle is instrumented to record that data for analysis. Typical instrumentation parameters recorded during a flight test for a large aircraft are: * Atmospheric (static) pressure and temperature; * Dynamic (\\"total\\") pressure and temperature, measured at various positions around the fuselage; * Structural loads in the wings and fuselage, including vibration levels; * Aircraft attitude, angle of attack, and angle of sideslip; * Accelerations in all six degrees of freedom, measured with accelerometers at different positions in the aircraft; * Noise levels (interior and exterior); * Internal temperature (in cabin and cargo compartments); * Aircraft controls deflection (stick/yoke, rudder pedal, and throttle position); * Engine performance parameters (pressure and temperature at various stages, thrust, fuel burn rate). Specific calibration instruments, whose behavior has been determined from previous tests, may be brought on board to supplement the aircraft's in-built probes. During the flight, these parameters are then used to compute relevant aircraft performance parameters, such as airspeed, altitude, weight, and center of gravity position. During selected phases of flight test, especially during early development of a new aircraft, many parameters are transmitted to the ground during the flight and monitored by flight test and test support engineers, or stored for subsequent data analysis. This provides for safety monitoring and allows for both real-time and full-simulation analysis of the data being acquired. ===Execution=== When the aircraft or launch vehicle is completely assembled and instrumented, many hours of ground testing are conducted. This allows exploring multiple aspects: basic aircraft vehicle operation, flight controls, engine performance, dynamic systems stability evaluation, and provides a first look at structural loads. The vehicle can then proceed with its maiden flight, a major milestone in any aircraft or launch vehicle development program. There are several aspects to a flight test program, among which: * Handling qualities, which evaluates the aircraft's controllability and response to pilot inputs throughout the range of flight; * Performance testing evaluates aircraft in relation to its projected abilities, such as speed, range, power available, drag, airflow characteristics, and so forth; * Aero-elastic/flutter stability, evaluates the dynamic response of the aircraft controls and structure to aerodynamic (i.e. air-induced) loads; * Avionics/systems testing verifies all electronic systems (navigation, communications, radars, sensors, etc.) perform as designed; * Structural loads measure the stresses on the airframe, dynamic components, and controls to verify structural integrity in all flight regimes. Testing that is specific to military aircraft includes : * Weapons delivery, which looks at the pilot's ability to acquire the target using on-board systems and accurately deliver the ordnance on target; * An evaluation of the separation of the ordnance as it leaves the aircraft to ensure there are no safety issues; * air-to-air refueling; * Radar/infrared signature measurement; * Aircraft carrier operations. Emergency situations are evaluated as a normal part of all flight test program. Examples are: engine failure during various phases of flight (takeoff, cruise, landing), systems failures, and controls degradation. The overall operations envelope (allowable gross weights, centers-of-gravity, altitude, max/min airspeeds, maneuvers, etc.) is established and verified during flight testing. Aircraft are always demonstrated to be safe beyond the limits allowed for normal operations in the Flight Manual. Because the primary goal of a flight test program is to gather accurate engineering data, often on a design that is not fully proven, piloting a flight test aircraft requires a high degree of training and skill. As such, such programs are typically flown by a specially trained test pilot, the data is gathered by a flight test engineer, and often visually displayed to the test pilot and/or flight test engineer using flight test instrumentation. ===Analysis and reporting=== It includes the analysis of a flight for certification. It analyze the internal and outer part of the flight by checking its all minute parts. Reporting includes the analyzed data result. Introduction Aircraft Performance has various missions such as Takeoff, Climb, Cruise, Acceleration, Deceleration, Descent, Landing and other Basic fighter maneuvers etc.. After the flight testing, the aircraft has to be certified according to their regulations like FAA's FAR, EASA's Certification Specifications (CS) and India's Air Staff Compliance and Requirements. 1\\\\. Flight Performance Evaluation and documentation * Flight data processing includes filtering, bias correction and resolution along flight path (Trajectory). * Analysis of mission segments from the flight test data. * Estimation of thrust using Performance Cycle Deck (PCD). * Calculation of In- flight thrust using In-Flight Thrust Deck (IFTD). * Documentation of Flight performance with standard procedures. * Validation and updating of Aircraft performance model. 2\\\\. Reduction of Flight performance to standard conditions * Model estimation of Aircraft Performance with International Standard Atmosphere conditions (ISA). * Non-standard (tested) conditions are studied by incorporating standard mass, altitude, speed, Throttle setting individually. * The individual effects are added to the tested (non-standard) conditions to obtain the performance at International Standard Atmosphere conditions for Certification. * For Takeoff and Landing, effect of Wind is considered too. 3\\\\. Preparation and Validation of Performance Charts for Operating Data Manual (ODM) Performance charts allow a pilot to predict the takeoff, climb, cruise, and landing performance of an aircraft. These charts, provided by the manufacturer, are included in the AFM/POH. Information the manufacturer provides on these charts has been gathered from test flights conducted in a new aircraft, under normal operating conditions while using average piloting skills, and with the aircraft and engine in good working order. Engineers record the flight data and create performance charts based on the behavior of the aircraft during the test flights. By using these performance charts, a pilot can determine the runway length needed to take off and land, the amount of fuel to be used during flight, and the time required to arrive at the destination. It is important to remember that the data from the charts will not be accurate if the aircraft is not in good working order or when operating under adverse conditions. Always consider the necessity to compensate for the performance numbers if the aircraft is not in good working order or piloting skills are below average. Each aircraft performs differently and, therefore, has different performance numbers. Compute the performance of the aircraft prior to every flight, as every flight is different. Every chart is based on certain conditions and contains notes on how to adapt the information for flight conditions. It is important to read every chart and understand how to use it. Read the instructions provided by the manufacturer. For an explanation on how to use the charts, refer to the example provided by the manufacturer for that specific chart. The information manufacturers furnish is not standardized. Information may be contained in a table format, and other information may be contained in a graph format. Sometimes combined graphs incorporate two or more graphs into one chart to compensate for multiple conditions of flight. Combined graphs allow the pilot to predict aircraft performance for variations in density altitude, weight, and winds all on one chart. Because of the vast amount of information that can be extracted from this type of chart, it is important to be very accurate in reading the chart. A small error in the beginning can lead to a large error at the end. The remainder of this section covers performance information for aircraft in general and discusses what information the charts contain and how to extract information from the charts by direct reading and interpolation methods. Every chart contains a wealth of information that should be used when flight planning. Examples of the table, graph, and combined graph formats for all aspects of flight will be discussed. Interpolation Not all of the information on the charts is easily extracted. Some charts require interpolation to find the information for specific flight conditions. Interpolating information means that by taking the known information, a pilot can compute intermediate information. However, pilots sometimes round off values from charts to a more conservative figure. Using values that reflect slightly more adverse conditions provides a reasonable estimate of performance information and gives a slight margin of safety. The following illustration is an example of interpolating information from a takeoff distance chart. * Model estimation for a wide range of atmospheric conditions, flight and engine parameters. * Preparation and Validation of charts and tables from model estimation to predict the aircraft performance. * This will enable the pilot to operate effectively and safely and do performance comparisons. ===Flight Test Team=== Flight test engineer's workstation aboard an Airbus A380 prototype The make-up of the Flight Test Team will vary with the organization and complexity of the flight test program, however, there are some key players who are generally part of all flight test organizations. The leader of a flight test team is usually a flight test engineer (FTE) or possibly an experimental test pilot. Other FTEs or pilots could also be involved. Other team members would be the Flight Test Instrumentation Engineer, Instrumentation System Technicians, the aircraft maintenance department (mechanics, electrical techs, avionics technicians, etc.), Quality/Product Assurance Inspectors, the ground-based computing/data center personnel, plus logistics and administrative support. Engineers from various other disciplines would support the testing of their particular systems and analyze the data acquired for their specialty area. Since many aircraft development programs are sponsored by government military services, military or government-employed civilian pilots and engineers are often integrated into the flight test team. The government representatives provide program oversight and review and approve data. Government test pilots may also participate in the actual test flights, possibly even on the first/maiden flight. ==References== ==Further reading== * Stephen Corda: Introduction to Aerospace Engineering with a Flight Test Perspective.

He also collaborated with the Rolling Stones and led his own band from the late 1970s. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. ==Early life== McLagan was born at West Middlesex Hospital, Isleworth, to Alec William McLagan, of Scottish descent, and Susan (née Young), from Mountrath, County Laois. He had an elder brother, Mike. The McLagan family lived in Hounslow, West London. Alec McLagan was an enthusiastic amateur skater, having been British speed-skating champion in 1928; a photograph of him in this role features on the cover of his son's solo album, Best of British (2000).Had Me a Real Good Time: The Faces Before During and After, Andy Neill, 2016, Omnibus Press He first started playing keyboards at the age of seven after his mother purchased an upright piano; one of his first appearances was in a group entitled 'the Blue Men' in which he played rhythm guitar. McLagan was educated at Spring Grove Grammar School, Isleworth, and the Twickenham College of Technology and School of Art. He quit his study of art to focus on music.Had Me a Real Good Time: The Faces Before During and After, Andy Neill, 2016, Omnibus Press ==Small Faces and Faces== McLagan first started playing in bands in the early 1960s, initially using the Hohner Cembalet before switching to the Hammond organ and Wurlitzer electric piano, as well as occasionally playing guitar. He was influenced by Cyril Davies' All Stars, and his first professional group was the Muleskinners, followed by the Boz People with future King Crimson and Bad Company member Boz Burrell. In 1965, he was hired, for the sum of £30 a week, to join Small Faces by their manager, Don Arden, replacing Jimmy Winston. McLagan played his debut gig with them at London's Lyceum Theatre on 2 November that year. Once the 'probation' period ended, McLagan's pay was reduced (at his request) to £20 a week, which was what the other band members were getting. They never received more than that because Don Arden collected all the proceeds of their hard work, and it wasn't until 1967 that they started receiving any royalties. With the band, he wrote and sang only two songs which are credited entirely to him, \\"Up the Wooden Hills to Bedfordshire\\" and \\"Long Agos and Worlds Apart\\", which appear on Small Faces and Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake respectively. However, he is also credited as a co-writer on several other tracks such as \\"Own Up Time\\", \\"Eddie's Dreaming\\" and \\"The Hungry Intruder\\". In 1969, Steve Marriott left the group; Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood joined, and the band changed its name to Faces. ==Work with other musicians== McLagan played piano on the studio side of the 1972 album The London Chuck Berry Sessions. After the Faces split up in 1975, McLagan worked as a sideman for the Rolling Stones, both in the studio (Some Girls including electric piano on \\"Miss You\\"), on tour and on various Ronnie Wood projects, including the New Barbarians. In addition, his session work has backed such artists as Chuck Berry, Jackson Browne, Joe Cocker, Bob Dylan, Melissa Etheridge, Bonnie Raitt, Paul Westerberg, Izzy Stradlin, John Hiatt, Frank Black, Nikki Sudden, John Mayer, Bruce Springsteen, Tony Scalzo, Carla Olson and Mick Taylor. McLagan played keyboards in the band that backed Bob Dylan on his 1984 joint European tour with Santana. Also playing in that band were Mick Taylor, Colin Allen and Greg Sutton. McLagan was a member of Billy Bragg's band \\"The Blokes\\" for several years in the late 1990s and early 2000s, co-writing and performing on the 2002 England, Half-English album and tour. McLagan (front) with reunited Faces at the Royal Albert Hall, October 2009 In 2009 McLagan joined the James McMurtry band on tour in Europe. On 25 September 2010, at Stubbs in Austin, Texas, McLagan joined The Black Crowes on keyboards and vocals for their encore set. The set included two Faces songs, \\"You're So Rude\\" and \\"Glad and Sorry\\". Also in 2013, he appeared with the Warren Haynes band at the Moody Theater in Austin, Texas, playing piano on one number and organ on the other. In 2014, McLagan was a founding member of the Empty Hearts. The group recorded on 429 Records and McLagan's bandmates included Blondie drummer Clem Burke, the Chesterfield Kings' bassist Andy Babiuk, the Cars' guitarist Elliot Easton, and the Romantics' guitarist and vocalist Wally Palmar. The band's self-titled first album was released 5 August 2014 and produced by Ed Stasium. McLagan is featured prominently on the Lucinda Williams double album Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone, which was released 30 September 2014 on her own label, Highway 20 Records. McLagan prominently features on Scunthorpe duo, Ruen Brothers debut album All My Shades Of Blue released 1 June 2018 via Ramseur Records. McLagan recorded his parts shortly before his death. It was produced by Rick Rubin. Other notable musicians on the album were Chad Smith from the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Dave Keuning from the Killers.

They currently play in the . ==History== Formed in 1886 New Mills quickly progressed through the local leagues in its early days and even had a spell in the Manchester League. However, the club disbanded and a new team was formed, New Mills St Georges, which in a period up to World War I, won a number of titles, including the Derbyshire Minor Cup. In 1919 the club began playing again and dropped the St Georges from its name. It joined the Manchester League once again and finished top in 1924 and, after finishing as runner-up the following season, lifted the championship once again in 1926. As well as winning the league, New Mills also won the Derbyshire Cup three seasons out of four. The club was extremely well supported and had regular gates of around 3000. This was a very successful few seasons for the club, and at least half a dozen players moved on to clubs in the Football League. The club was once again disbanded due to World War II but reformed again afterwards, this time entering the Manchester Amateur League before progressing once again to the Manchester League, taking the title in 1956. In 1959, Joe Martin took charge as manager, which started a run of success for the club, winning the league seven times before he retired in 1972. New Mills AFC v Ramsbottom United at Church Lane The club eventually moved up to the Cheshire County League and later the North West Counties League. The club began to suffer financially, however, and in the summer of 1983 ceased playing in that competition. Birch Vale and Thornsett F.C. were looking for a new ground and became tenants at Church Lane. Eventually, they took over running of the club and became New Mills Football Club. The club rejoined the Manchester League and in 1977, thanks to a fund-raising appeal along with a grant from the Lottery Association, redeveloped its Church Lane ground to what it is today. In 2002–03 they became semi professional when their application to the North West Counties League was approved. New Mills won the North West Counties League Division Two title in the 2007–08 season under the leadership of former Stockport County player Tony Hancock, who had joined as manager in 2005. New Mills then followed up its Division Two title with a record-breaking 2008–09 season during which it set a new league and club record by winning 21 consecutive games, missing out on the Division One title only on goal difference to AFC Fylde, which beat the Millers 5–0 on the last day of the league season in front of a crowd of over 1,400. Two days after the disappointment on the Fylde coast, the Millers lifted the League Cup for the first time by beating Runcorn Linnets 2–0 at the Tameside Stadium, the home of Curzon Ashton. Goals from Garry Kharas and Scott McGowan ensured the Millers did not end the season empty handed. The star player during this era was Carlos Meakin who scored 150 goals in only 200 games, predominantly whilst playing in midfield. During the close season of 2009–10, in which New Mills finished as runner-up for the second year in a row, manager Tony Hancock resigned but then had a change of heart and returned to lead the Millers until he again resigned in March 2010 when the player budget was cut. For the remainder of the season Ally Pickering was named caretaker manager and he took the role full time in 2010–11. The entrance to Church Lane Pickering had great success in his first full season as manager and led the Millers to the league title and promotion to the Northern Premier League. A league and cup double was denied though when Winsford beat the Millers 1–0 a few weeks later. During the 2011 pre-season to mark the club's 125th anniversary Alex Ferguson sent a Manchester United XI to Church Lane. United won 7–0, with their team including future England internationals Michael Keane and Jesse Lingard. In the 2011–12 season Pickering led the Millers to a 9th place after a poor winter saw the team slip out of the play-off places. New Mills were placed in the Southern League but after one season were switched to the Northern Premier League. Pickering remained in charge until October 2012, when he and the club parted company by mutual consent. Former FC United of Manchester coach Roy Soule became caretaker manager on Pickering's departure and almost led the team to another promotion – they lost 2–0 to Trafford in the play-offs. Soule resigned at the end of the 2014–15 season after a disappointing season, the club finishing 2nd from bottom and in the relegation places, and further significant budget cuts. The club accepted a reprieve from the FA to stay in the EvoStik league and Soule was replaced by former Stalybridge Celtic manager Keith Briggs. Briggs resigned just 23 days later after accepting a full time coaching role at Sheffield United and was succeeded by his assistant Andy Fearn, who appointed former Manchester City striker Shaun Goater as his assistant. Fearn and Goater resigned after nine matches, all of which were lost, and former Wythenshawe Town staffer Garry Brown took over, supported by ex-Stockport County winger Paul Williams. The club attracted national attention with their unenviable season record of 26 defeats from the opening 26 league and cup games (the team featured in a TV advert voiced by Harry Redknapp, and the chairman stated defiantly in a two-page article in the Daily Telegraph that \\"we're not scared of anyone\\"); they were relegated in April 2016 with only 3 points, from 3 draws, a Northern Premier League record low. The Millers kicked off the 2016–17 league season with a 4–3 win over Cammell Laird under manager Garry Brown. This was the Millers' first win in almost 18 months. However, Brown resigned in September 2016 after a poor run of results, assistant Paul Williams taking over. In December 2016, with the team lying in the relegation zone of the NWCFL Premier Division, Williams was sacked and replaced by Calum Sykes, who had been in charge at nearby Stockport Town since its formation. Sykes immediately brought the entire Stockport Town team over with him, despite them playing in a lower division; the new team were unable to improve their league position and the Millers were relegated in April 2017, 7 points short of safety. Sykes stayed until November 2017 but resigned after a poor run of results. His assistants Dowse and Cross stayed on as joint managers and despite some heavy defeats steered the club to a 14th-place position (halting a run of two successive relegations). A book has been written about the club's plight by local comedian Carl Jones entitled Winless; it is awaiting publication. ==Attendances== ===Records=== *Largest attendance : 4,500 v Hyde United 9 September 1922.

Their traditional occupation was weaving. Meghwals are known for their contribution to embroidery and the textile industry. Most are Hindu by religion, with Rishi Megh, Kabir, Ram Devji and Bankar Mataji their chief gods. They were considered to be an untouchable community and are now classified as a Scheduled Caste under India's reservation system. ==Synonyms== The Meghwal community is known by various names, depending on location. Examples include Megh and Menghvar. ==Origins== They claim to have descended from Rishi Megh, a saint who had the power to bring rain from the clouds through his prayer. The word Meghwar is derived from the Sanskrit words megh, meaning clouds and rain, and war (Hindi: वार), meaning a group, son and child. (Sanskrit: वार:) Literally, then, the words Meghwal and Meghwar connote a people who belong to Megh lineage. Some Meghwals are associated with other social groups. Shyam Lal Rawat refers to the Meghwals of Rajasthan as \\"one of the dominating low untouchable castes ... earlier known as Chamars\\", a connection also made by Debashis Debnath. The Balali and Bunkar communities have also begun using the Meghwal name. ==Geographical distribution== The Meghwal are found in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The Meghs, Kabir Panthi or Bhagat are from Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and KashmirCensus India - Govt. of India and are known as Megh, Arya Megh and Bhagat. In some places they are known as Ganeshia, Meghbansi, Mihagh, Rakhesar, Rakhia, Rikhia, Rishia and other names. Some of the Mahashas also claim to be belonging to Meghs. After Partition of India in 1947, the Meghs who had become converts to the Hinduism, had to migrate to Indian territory. As of 1991, the population of Meghs in Punjab (India) was estimated at 105,157. ==Lifestyle== In the countryside of Rajasthan, many of the people of this community still reside in small hamlets of round, mud-brick huts painted on the outside with colourful geometric designs and decorated with detailed mirror inlays. In earlier days the main occupation of the Meghwal community was agricultural labour, weaving, specially Khadi and woodcarving, and these are still the main occupations. The women are famous for their embroidery work and are master wool and cotton weavers. Increasing numbers of the Meghwal today are educated and are obtaining government jobs. In Punjab, especially in the cities like Amritsar, Jalandhar and Ludhiana a good number of them is engaged as workers in factories producing sports, hosiery, surgical and metal goods. Very few of them have their own business or a small scale industry. Tiny business and service units are their main support for livelihood. Their staple diet includes rice, wheat and maize, and pulses such as moong, urad and channa. They are not vegetarian but eat egg, fish, chicken and mutton when available, although they abstain from pork, beef and buffalo meat. Women have low status in traditional Meghwal society. Marriages are arranged through negotiation between the families before puberty. After marriage, the wife moves to the husband's house, except for the period of childbirth. However, divorce is allowed, with the father retaining liability for the children and compensation paid to the wife. ==Arts== The Meghwal women in Rajasthan are renowned for their exuberantly detailed costumes and jewellery. Married women are often spotted wearing gold nose ring, earrings and neckpieces. They were given to the bride as a \\"bride wealth\\" dowry by her soon-to-be husband's mother. Nose rings and earrings are often decorated with precious stones of ruby, sapphire and emerald. The Meghwal women's embroidery is avidly sought after. Their work is distinguished by their primary use of red, which comes from a local pigment produced from crushed insects. The Meghwal women artisans of Thar desert in Sindh and Balochistan, and in Gujarat are considered master of the traditional embroidery and Ralli making. Exotic hand-embroidered items form part of dowry of Meghwal woman. ==References== Category:Social groups of Rajasthan Category:Social groups of Gujarat Category:Weaving communities of South Asia Category:Social groups of Jammu and Kashmir Category:Dalit communities Category:Scheduled Castes Category:Social groups of Sindh ","title":"Meghwal"},{"id":"3241011","text":"Anders Per-Arne Björck (born 19 September 1944) is a Swedish politician who was Minister for Defence from 1991 to 1994 and Governor of Uppsala County from 2003 to 2009. ==Career== Björck was born on 19 September 1944 in Nässjö, Sweden, the son of Arne Björck and his wife Ann-Marie (née Svensson). He attended Centralskolan in Nässjö and passed studentexamen at Nässjö läroverk in 1966. Swedish was interested in politics from an early stage. He was national chairman of the Moderate Youth League, or the Rightist Youth League (Högerns ungdomsförbund) as it was known at the time of his election. He was the first truly young – only 21 – chairman of the Youth League – his predecessor was 35 years old. Before that he served as national chairman of the Conservative School Youth, today known as the Moderate School Youth, from 1961 to 1963. In 1968, aged only 22, he was elected to the Riksdag for the Rightist Party (Högerpartiet) which became the Moderate Party in 1969. In 1989 he was elected president of the Council of Europe and served until 1991, when the Moderate Party won the election and Carl Bildt was allowed to form a government. He was appointed Minister for Defence. When the Moderates lost the 1994 election he became vice speaker of the Riksdag, a position he held until 2002. Björck was known to belong to the so-called \\"Bunker gang\\", a group of politicians and advisors forming the inner circle around party leader Carl Bildt. Between 2003 and 2009, Björck was Governor of Uppsala County. Anders Björck has continued to speak up on political issues from time to time. He remains rather Conservative, compared to other Moderates, and has on numerous occasions spoken up against what he perceives as the growing influence of liberalism in the Moderate Party. ==Personal life== In 1975, Björck married Py-Lotte von Zweigbergk (born 1948), the daughter of Sverker von Zweigbergk and Astrid (née Sigström).

About 3,200 species of treehoppers in over 400 genera are known.Treehoppers. Dr. Metcalf. NCSU Libraries. North Carolina State University. They are found on all continents except Antarctica; only five species are known from Europe. Individual treehoppers usually live for only a few months. ==Morphology== A treehopper of the species Heteronotus nodosus investigated by Micro-CT, revealing the interior morphology. The interior of the extended pronotum, in this species mimicking a wasp's body, is empty. Treehoppers, due to their unusual appearance, have long interested naturalists. They are best known for their enlarged and ornate pronotum, expanded into often fantastic shapes that enhance their camouflage or mimicry, often resembling plant thorns (thus the commonly used name of \\"thorn bugs\\" for a number of treehopper species). The specialised pronotum (or helmet) may not be simply an expansion of the prothoracic sclerite, but a fused pair of dorsal appendages of the first thoracic segment. These may be serial homologues of insect wings, which are dorsal appendages of the second and/or third thoracic segments, although this interpretation has been seriously challenged.Yoshizawa, K. (2012) The treehopper’s helmet is not homologous with wings (Hemiptera: Membracidae) Systematic Entomology. 37, 2–6. Evidence for this theory included the development of the helmet, which arises as a pair of appendages attached to each side of the dorsal prothorax by an articulation with muscles and a flexible membrane that allow it to be mobile (also, similar genes are involved in development of the helmet and the wings). Distinguishing males from females is accomplished only by looking at the genitalia. ==Ecology== Treehoppers pierce plant stems with their beaks and feed upon sap. The young can frequently be found on herbaceous shrubs and grasses, while the adults more often frequent hardwood tree species. Excess sap becomes concentrated as honeydew, which often attracts ants. Some species have a well-developed ant mutualism, and these species are normally gregarious as well, which attracts more ants. The ants provide protection from predators. Treehoppers mimic thorns to prevent predators from spotting them. Others have formed mutualisms with wasps, such as Parachartergus apicalis. Even geckos form mutualistic relations with treehoppers, with whom they communicate by small vibrations of the abdomen.BBC documentary Life in Cold Blood, episode Dragons of the Dry, minute 22 Eggs are laid by the female with her saw-like ovipositor in slits cut into the cambium or live tissue of stems, though some species lay eggs on top of leaves or stems. The eggs may be parasitised by wasps, such as the tiny fairyflies (Mymaridae) and Trichogrammatidae. The females of some membracid species sit over their eggs to protect them from predators and parasites, and may buzz their wings at intruders. The females of some gregarious species work together to protect each other's eggs. In at least one species, Publilia modesta, mothers serve to attract ants when nymphs are too small to produce much honeydew. Some other species make feeding slits for the nymphs. Like the adults, the nymphs also feed upon sap, and unlike adults, have an extensible anal tube that appears designed to deposit honeydew away from their bodies. The tube appears to be longer in solitary species rarely attended by ants. It is important for sap-feeding bugs to dispose of honeydew, as otherwise it can become infected with sooty moulds. Indeed, one of the evident benefits of ants for Publilia concava nymphs is that the ants remove the honeydew and reduce such fungal growth. Most species are innocuous to humans, although a few are considered minor pests, such as Umbonia crassicornis (a thorn bug), the three- cornered alfalfa hopper (Spissistilus festinus), and the buffalo treehopper (Stictocephala bisonia), which has been introduced to Europe. The cowbug Oxyrachis tarandus has been recorded as a pest of Withania somnifera in India. ==Systematics== The diversity of treehoppers has been little researched, and their systematic arrangement is tentative. It seems three main lineages can be distinguished; the Endoiastinae are the most ancient treehoppers, still somewhat resembling cicadas. Centrotinae form the second group; they are somewhat more advanced but the pronotum still does not cover the scutellum in almost all of these. The Darninae, Heteronotinae, Membracinae and Smiliinae contain the most apomorphic treehoppers. Several proposed subfamilies seem to be paraphyletic. Centronodinae and Nicomiinae might need to be merged into the Centrotinae to result in a monophyletic group.

Text usually refers to all the alphanumeric characters specified on the keyboard of the person engaging the practice, but in general text means the abstraction layer immediately above the standard character encoding of the target text. The term processing refers to automated (or mechanized) processing, as opposed to the same manipulation done manually. Text processing involves computer commands which invoke content, content changes, and cursor movement, for example to * search and replace * format * generate a processed report of the content of, or * filter a file or report of a text file. The text processing of a regular expression is a virtual editing machine, having a primitive programming language that has named registers (identifiers), and named positions in the sequence of characters comprising the text. Using these, the \\"text processor\\" can, for example, mark a region of text, and then move it. The text processing of a utility is a filter program, or filter. These two mechanisms comprise text processing. ==Definition== Since the standardized markup such as ANSI escape codes are generally invisible to the editor, they comprise a set of transitory properties that become at times indistinguishable from word processing. But the definite distinctions from word processing are that text processing proper: * represents \\"text processing utilities\\", not just \\"text editing\\" applications. * is much more \\"the keyboard way\\", as opposed to \\"the mouse way\\" (e.g. drag and drop, cut and paste) of initiating an edit. * is sequential access rather than random access in approach. * operates directly at the presentation layer rather than indirectly at the application layer. * works raw data that is standardized and works more openly rather than tending towards any proprietary methods. In this way markup such as font and color are not really a distinguishing factor, because the character sequences that affect font and color are simply standard characters inserted automatically by a background text processing mode, made to work transparently by compliant text editors, yet becoming otherwise visible as text processing commands when that mode is not in effect. So text processing is defined most basically (but not entirely) around the visual characters (or graphemes) rather than the standard, yet invisible characters. ==History== The development of computer text processing started in earnest with Kleene's formalizing what is a regular language. Such regular expressions could then became a mini-program, complete with a compilation process, available to perform any edit, once that language was extended. Similarly, filters are extended by evolving particular options. ==Basic concepts== An editor essentially invokes an input stream and directs it to the text processing environment, which is either a command shell or a text editor. The resulting output is applicable to further text processing, the final result of which is comparable to a single application of an algorithm applied once by a more sophisticated and structured computer program. Text processing is, unlike an algorithm, is a manually administered sequence of simpler macros that are the pattern-action expressions and filtering mechanisms. In either case the programmer's intention is impressed indirectly upon a given set of textual characters in the act of text processing. The results of a text processing step are sometimes only hopeful, and the attempted mechanism is often subject to multiple drafts through visual feedback, until the regular expression or markup language details, or until the utility options, are fully mastered. Text processing is concerned mostly with producing textual characters at the highest level of computing, where its activities are just below the practical uses of computing--the manual transmission of information. Ultimately all computing is text processing, from the self-compiling textual characters of an assembler, through the automated programming language generated to handle a blob of graphical data, and finally to the metacharacters of regular expressions which groom existing text documents. Text processing is its own automation. ===Characters=== Textual characters come in standardized character sets containing also control characters such a newline character, which arrange text. Other types of control characters arrange the transmission, define the character sets, and perform other housekeeping tasks. ==See also== * Text editor * List of Unix commands ==External links== * The subject matter of the book Automatic Text Processing by Gerard Salton * Database with Text Processing Tools (2013-10-23) * Content analysis software Software for Content Analysis. * Text Tools Online Online Text processing tools.

Formed in 1993, the mostly Chicago-based band had recorded and toured sporadically in various configurations until 1997. Brise- Glace used guitar improvisation, white noise, and found sounds to create a brooding and almost minimal, eerie musical sound. ==History== Brise-Glace formed shortly after O'Rourke and Gray met at a concert of Gray's group Dazzling Killmen. Posa (then of Chicago's avant-jazz perennials the Flying Luttenbachers) and Jones were drafted soon afterwards. The group had recorded and released the five-song, 50-minute When in Vanitas... on Skin Graft Records in 1994. The recording was engineered by Steve Albini, and has guest appearances by Henry Kaiser on guitar, Gene Coleman on bass clarinet, Christoph Heemann on tape and David Grubbs on organ. Brise-Glace's recording aesthetic was partly inspired by iconic German group Can: they would improvise live in the recording studio, then O'Rourke would extensively edit the recording tapes; thus his \\"razor blade\\" credit. Shortwave radio noise, field recordings and other tape effects were also integrated into the final mix. A brief snippet of one of the album's tracks \\"Neither Yield Nor Reap\\" was used in a 2000 Saturday Night Live short about Neil Armstrong.Skin Graft News The band also recorded a 1994 7\\" titled In Sisters All and Felony/Angels on Installment Plan, and their cover of \\"Angus Dei Aus Licht\\" was released on Skin Graft's AC/DC tribute series Sides 1-4 in 1996. Their track \\"Likeness\\" appeared on 1997's Camp Skin Graft: Now Wave (!) Compilation. ==Related projects== Yona-Kit was active simultaneously and closely related, with Japanese guitarist KK Null replacing Posa and steering the group towards a more aggressive sound but still with an experimental edge. Brise-Glace was among the many projects of which Jim O'Rourke had taken part of in the 1990s. Besides his work as a producer, solo artist and filmmaker, he had also played in The Bells, Gastr Del Sol, Illusion of Safety, Yona-Kit, and Sonic Youth.

This consisted of a root symbol ('IBM') + month code ('A') + strike price code ('F'). The root symbol is the symbol of the stock on the stock exchange. After this comes the month code, A-L mean January–December calls, M-X mean January–December puts. The strike price code is a letter corresponding with a certain strike price (which letter corresponds with which strike price depends on the stock). On February 12, 2010 the five-character ticker format stopped being used in the US and Canada. The new standard is now fully in place, as in the first few months after February 12 the LEAP roots and additional roots needed to handle large numbers of options for a given issuer were consolidated into a single root ticker for a given underlying symbol. Options Clearing Corporation's (OCC) Options Symbology Initiative (OSI) mandated an industry-wide change to a new option symbol structure, resulting in option symbols 21 characters in length. March 2010 - May 2010 was the symbol consolidation period in which all outgoing option roots will be replaced with the underlying stock symbol. On March 18, 2013, CBOE Mini Options became available for trading on a select group of securities (AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, GLD, and SPY). These options represent a deliverable of 10 shares of an underlying security, whereas standard equity options represent a deliverable of 100 shares.

Est! Est! legend. Montefiascone is a town and comune of the province of Viterbo, in Lazio, central Italy. It stands on a hill on the southeast side of Lake Bolsena, about north of Rome. ==History== The name of the city derives from that of the Falisci (Mons Faliscorum, \\"Mountain of the Falisci\\"). Later, it was controlled by the Etruscans. It was suggested that Montefiascone occupies the site of the Etruscan Temple called Fanum Voltumnae, at which the representatives of the twelve chief cities of Etruria met in the days of their independence. Under the Empire, the festival was held near Volsinii. Cathedral of Montefiascone The first documents mentioning Montefiascone are from 853 CE, when it belonged to the bishop of Tuscania. In 1058 and 1074 the Popes Stephen IX and Gregory VII, respectively, stopped here. In 1093 the fortress was besieged by Emperor Henry IV. The importance of the fortress was confirmed by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa's visit in 1185. In the following two centuries, as a Papal possession, Montefiascone lived its period of highest splendour. The Castle was often residence of Popes, and was consequently enlarged and embellished. During Avignon Papacy, it was the main residence of the Papal legate Cardinal Albornoz. In 1463, however, it was already decaying, as in the words of by Pope Pius II. The decline increased after the plague of 1657 and the earthquake of 1697. It became part of the new Kingdom of Italy in 1870. It was damaged by two Allied bombings in May 1944. ==Main sights== *Montefiascone Cathedral is one of the earliest structures by Michele Sanmicheli. Dedicated to Saint Margaret (Santa Margherita), the cathedral was a ruin in 1330 and took three centuries to rebuild. Subsequently, in 1670, it suffered a serious fire, with repairs taking a further decade. The interior was elaborately restored in 1893. *Santa Maria delle Grazie: church also by Sanmicheli. *San Flaviano: church built in 1032, repaired and enlarged in the Gothic style late in the 14th century, a curious double church of importance in the history of architecture; in its interior some 14th-century frescoes were discovered in 1896.

It was used by Kofi Kingston, who calls it the Boom Drop. ===Extreme leg drop=== This leg drop variation sees the attacking wrestler hold the opponent's legs and then do a double leg drop (legs together) onto the opponent's groin/lower-abdominal area. If performed to hit the lower abdomen, the user slightly bends their legs to force their heels into the lower abdomen. If it is to hit the groin area, the attacking wrestler bends out (that is to say, juts out their rear end) and keeps their legs straight to force the heels or lower legs into the groin. It was popularized by Jeff Hardy. ===Guillotine leg drop=== This move is similar to the leg drop, although it is done with the opponent's body hanging over something, sometimes with the opponent's head hung over one of the ring ropes or the ring apron (so the head is suspended over the outside). The wrestler will then walk across the apron and execute a leg drop onto the opponent's sternum, causing both of them to fall and land on the outside of the ring. This also refers to the attacker's leg hitting the opponent's throat in a standard leg drop. Jumping leg drop This variation sees a wrestler execute a jump before performing a standing or a running leg drop to an opponents head, chest or midsection ===Running leg drop=== A variation to the original, the attacking wrestler bounces off from one side of the ring, runs and performs the leg drop across the opponent's chest. The running leg drop is famously Hulk Hogan's finishing move, usually preceded by a big boot. Sliding leg drop This variation sees the attacker perform a running or baseball slide towards an opponent lying on the mat, before using their momentum to perform a leg drop on the opponent's head, midsection, or back. ===Slingshot leg drop=== The attacker, while outside of the ring, pulls back on the ropes and, assisted by the rebound of the ropes, propels themselves into the ring and onto their victim. Variations include using the ropes for a slingshot somersault leg drop and a slingshot springboard (where the attacker leaps onto top of the ropes) diving leg drop. Another variant is when the attacker slingshots onto the opponent's neck. WWE wrestler Victoria used this move in many of her matches. ===Somersault leg drop=== An attacking wrestler performs a jumping forward somersault to drop their leg across the throat or chest of an opponent. There is also a variation where the leg that will be dropped on the opponent is swung forward while in a standing position next to the opponent, then swiftly swung back so the momentum from the pendulum motion carries the attacker through a somersault and the leg is dropped on whichever body part is targeted. Alicia Fox uses this move as a signature. ===Split-legged leg drop=== This is very similar to the actual leg drop, but there are two variations to this move. The first is that the attacking wrestler jumps, splits their legs in the air, then hits one of their legs on the opponent's chest/neck area. Another variation is that a standing wrestler hooks one of their leg up to their head, then falls in a split position on the opponent's chest/neck area; sometimes the attacking wrestler pins the opponent with a split. This move is usually performed by women, such as Christy Hemme, Naomi, and Cameron. ===Springboard leg drop=== An attacking wrestler jumps off the ring ropes from either inside the ring or from the apron, spreads their legs in the air, and lands one of their legs across their opponent's face, chest, or neck. ==See also== *Double leg drop – Two man tandem leg drop *Diving leg drop – Leg drops from elevated positions *Scissors kick – modified leg drop style attack *Professional wrestling attacks Category:Professional wrestling moves ","title":"Leg drop"},{"id":"3241134","text":"Emma Livry (born as Jeanne Emma Emarot or Emma Marie Emarot; 24 September 1842 - 26 July 1863) was one of the last ballerinas of the Romantic ballet era and a protégée of Marie Taglioni. She died from complications after burn injuries sustained when her costume caught fire during a rehearsal. ==Biography== Livry was the illegitimate daughter of Célestine Emarot, a ballet dancer, and Baron Charles de Chassiron, which prompted the following rhyming verse: :Can so skinny a rat :Be the daughter of so round a cat? ===Career=== She studied dancing under Madame Dominique and attended the Paris Opera School. Her career was promoted by her mother's lover at the time, Vicomte Ferdinand de Montguyon. On 19 October 1858, at the age of sixteen, she made her debut with the Paris Opera Ballet at the Salle Le Peletier as the sylph in La Sylphide. Her talent brought her fame and she became a widely respected ballerina. Montguyon prevailed upon the director of the Opera to change the programme so that Marie Taglioni (who originated the role) would see Livry in La Sylphide when she visited. Taglioni decided to stay on in Paris to teach the girl, who reminded her of herself as a young woman. She choreographed for Livry the title-role of Farfalla (Butterfly) in Le Papillon, the only full-length ballet composed by Jacques Offenbach. The sculptor Jean-Auguste Barre created a figurine of Livry in this role in bronze and bisque versions. Paul Smith wrote in Revue et gazette musicale de Paris: ===Accidental death=== On 15 November 1862, Livry was rehearsing the title role of Fenella, a mime part and the title role in Auber's opera La muette de Portici. Making her second-act entrance, she shook out her skirts, which caught fire on a gaslight. The accident was avoidable: a method of fire-proofing costumes was available in this period, but Livry and most female performers of the period were opposed to it because it discolored and stiffened fabrics.Roger L. Williams, Gaslight and Shadow: The World of Napoleon III (NY: Macmillan, 1957), 106. Fire- proofing was required by an imperial decree of 27 November 1859. In 1860 a dancer's costume had caught fire during rehearsals for Offenbach's Le Papillon which starred Livry. In flames, she ran across the stage three times before she was caught and the fire extinguished with the help of firemen and other dancers. Her burns were more extensive than deep. She had clasped the burning fabric to her torso out of modesty. Emma Livry in Herculanum Her face and breasts were undamaged. According to the doctor in attendance, her thighs, waist, back, shoulders and arms were burned, and her stays were burned on. She tried to pray. Taglioni, who was watching the rehearsal, rubbed make-up grease into her wounds in the mistaken belief that it would act as ointment. She suffered for months, yet remained opposed to fire-proofed skirts: \\"Yes, they are, as you say, less dangerous, but should I ever return to the stage, I would never think of wearing them – they are so ugly.\\" In 1863, she was moved from her home in Paris to Neuilly-sur-Seine. Her wounds re-opened and she succumbed to septicæmia. Montguyon was with her when she died. She was only 20 years old. After a funeral at Notre Dame de Lorette in Paris, she was buried in the Cimetière de Montmartre. The surviving scraps of her costume can be seen in the Musée de l'Opéra in Paris. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources and further reading=== *M.

First observed in the western Caribbean Sea on February 2 as a non-frontal low, it moved rapidly throughout its duration and struck southwestern Florida early the next day as a gale-force storm. In the state, the winds damaged some crops and power lines, but no serious damage was reported. The system became a tropical storm after emerging over the Atlantic Ocean before quickly transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on February 4\\\\. Strong winds and waves washed a freighter ashore, but no injuries were related to the event. Subsequently, the storm brushed eastern New England, causing minor power outages, before it moved inland near Maine. There were no reported fatalities related to the storm. ==Meteorological history== Storm path On February 2, Groundhog Day, a disturbance was first observed in the western Caribbean Sea. Winds were estimated at around 35 mph (55 km/h), and it tracked rapidly northward, initially to the north-northwest. After passing near Cancún along the Yucatan Peninsula, it turned northeastward and brushed the northwest coast of Cuba. Early on February 3 the storm approached Key West, and shortly thereafter moved ashore near Cape Sable, Florida. It quickly crossed the state, passing near Miami before emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean. The Miami National Weather Service office recorded a wind gust of 84 mph (110 km/h), as well as sustained tropical storm force winds for about four hours; the station also recorded a barometric pressure of 1004 mbar (29.66 inHg). After leaving Florida, the storm continued rapidly northeastward and transitioned into a tropical cyclone. Late on February 3 it reached its peak strength with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). On February 4 it completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone off the coast of North Carolina. Around that time, gale force winds extended 100 miles (160 km) to the east of the center. Later that day, it passed over Cape Cod, and early on February 5 it moved into eastern Maine. The Hurricane Research Division assessed the storm as losing its identity shortly thereafter, over New Brunswick. However, a map produced by the U.S. Weather Bureau indicated that the storm continued northward into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and later crossed eastern Quebec and Labrador. By February 6, it reached the ocean again, deepening to a minimum pressure of 988 mbar (29.18 inHg). At that point, the Weather Bureau track ended, and as such the ultimate fate of the storm is unknown. ==Impact and records== Residents and tourists in southern Florida were unprepared for the unusual off-season storm. Winds of up to 65 mph (105 km/h) spread across the area, causing damage to windows and power lines. The storm dropped 2–4 inches (50–100 mm) of precipitation along its path; the combination of unseasonable rainfall and winds resulted in crop damage in Miami-Dade County. Pressure map showing the Groundhog Day tropical storm as an extratropical storm off the Eastern seaboard. After the storm moved into the western Atlantic, the Miami U.S. Weather Bureau issued storm warnings for the North Carolina coastline from Wilmington to Cape Hatteras; the region was warned to prepare for strong winds. The agency also issued a small craft advisory southward through Charleston, South Carolina. Offshore, the storm produced winds of up to 85 mph (140 km/h), as well as waves up to 35 feet (10 m) in height. The combination of the winds and rough waves drove a freighter ashore along Portsmouth Island in the Outer Banks, after the engine was damaged when water entered the fuel line. The 26 person crew initially planned to evacuate, but they later decided to stay on the freighter as the U.S. Coast Guard were deployed to assist. The seas damaged a portion of the ship, but the entire crew was rescued without any injuries. The storm later brushed New England, bringing rain, fog, warmer temperatures, and gusty winds. The combination resulted in downed power poles and tree limbs, leaving 10,000 houses without electricity. The storm was described as a \\"freak\\", forming about three months after the end of the hurricane season. The chief forecaster at Miami U.S. Weather Bureau, Grady Norton, remarked that he was unsure how the cyclone developed. It is the only tropical or subtropical storm on record during February, and was the earliest tropical cyclone to strike the United States. Its structure initially was uncertain, and the storm was not included in the 1952 Atlantic hurricane season summary published by the Miami Weather Bureau office. Ultimately it was included in the tropical cyclone database. Had it been operationally treated as a tropical cyclone, it would have been named Tropical Storm Able. ==See also== * List of off-season Atlantic hurricanes * List of Florida hurricanes (1950–1974) * Tropical Storm Ana (2015) – The earliest tropical cyclone on record to make landfall on the United States, in any given year ==References== Category:1952 Atlantic hurricane season Category:Atlantic tropical storms Category:Off-season Atlantic tropical cyclones Category:Atlantic hurricanes in Mexico Category:Hurricanes in Florida Category:1952 natural disasters in the United States Category:February 1952 events ","title":"1952 Groundhog Day tropical storm"},{"id":"3241164","text":"Cantharis fusca is a species of soldier beetle.

However, Tuhay Bey's army was intercepted by the Polish army under hetman Koniecpolski before reaching the densely populated regions of Ukraine and defeated in the First Battle of Okhmativ. In 1648 he brought an army (estimated 6,000-20,000) to help Bohdan Khmelnytsky during the Cossack uprising against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. There he took part in several important battles and was eventually killed during the Battle of Berestechko.Podhorodecki, page 193Serczyk, page 339 He was portrayed in the Polish novel and film With Fire and Sword. In the film he was played by Daniel Olbrychski.

Its two tributaries are the Big Water of Fleet, which begins around Loch Grannoch, and the Little Water of Fleet. The river flows through Gatehouse of Fleet before meeting the sea. The Water of Fleet rises on the slopes of Cairnsmore of Fleet, a 710 m high hill that is designated as a National Nature Reserve. Lower down, the Fleet Valley contains the best examples of upland oakwood in Kirkcudbrightshire, two of which (Killiegowan Wood and Carstramon Wood) are designated as Special Areas of Conservation. The lower part of the area surrounding the Water of Fleet is designated as the Fleet Valley National Scenic Area, one of forty such areas in Scotland, which have been defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The Fleet Valley national scenic area (NSA) covers 5854 ha in total, of which 5373 ha is on land, with a further 481 ha being marine (i.e. below low tide level). The coastal part of the NSA covers the shoreline, islands, foreshore and sea area of Fleet Bay between Barlocco Isle and Ringdoo Point. Inland the NSA includes the town of Gatehouse of Fleet, and land on both sides of River Fleet for about 10 km northwards. The area represents a microcosm of Scotland, with coastal scenery in the south, and a wilder landscape of hills and moors in the north. In between there is slow transition through farmland and fields, with an abundance of drystane dykes and open woodland. The shoreline of Fleet Bay was a favourite location for artists from the Kirkcudbright Artists' Colony. The Big Water of Fleet is crossed by a twenty span viaduct, which was once a part of the Portpatrick Railway route. Cardoness Castle is a well-preserved 15th- century tower house just below Gatehouse of Fleet, close to the point at which the river begins to widen towards Fleet Bay. It was originally owned by the MacCullochs of Myreton. They abandoned the castle in the late 17th Century, following the execution of Sir Godfrey McCulloch for the murder of a Clan Gordon neighbour.

It received the first Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1918. ==Plot introduction== His Family tells the story of a middle-class family in New York City in the 1910s. The family's patriarch, widower Roger Gale, struggles to deal with the way his daughters and grandchildren respond to the changing society. Each of his daughters responds in a distinctively different way to the circumstances of their lives, forcing Roger into attempting to calm the increasingly challenging family disputes that erupt. ==Plot summary== The story begins in the spring of 1913 with Roger Gale, a New York businessman and a widower, owner of a media monitoring service, reflecting on the changes that have come to New York since his arrival in the city as a young man from a New Hampshire farm somewhere near the time of the Civil War. He is driven by his wife's dying request to remain close to their three daughters, yet he feels very distant from them—this despite the fact that the younger two (Deborah, a school principal, and Laura) live in the family home with him, and Edith, who is married with four children, visits him regularly. The early conflicts within the family largely surround Laura's sudden announcement of her engagement to Hal Sloane, a young businessman who is generally unknown to the family, and Edith's pregnancy, as her fifth child arrives weeks before his due date, endangering her life. After the baby's birth and Laura's wedding (and subsequent honeymoon to Europe), Roger's concerns turn to the one daughter remaining at home. Deborah works constantly at her school, and spends her free hours agitating for reforms and financial support to help the families living in the tenements. Roger is disturbed by this, especially given his prejudices against the immigrant families Deborah works with, but a visit to Deborah's school changes his perspective. He takes a crippled Irish boy named John into his care, providing him with lodging and a job in Roger's news clipping office downtown. When summer arrives, the family goes to spend most of it on the old family farm in New Hampshire. At the farm, Edith's oldest son, George, is happiest, pursuing his interest in becoming a farmer someday; Edith's husband, Bruce Cunningham, spends most of his time racing around the backroads on his brand-new automobile. That following winter, Roger becomes concerned about his daughter, Deborah, whose suitor Allan Baird, a doctor and friend of the family, seems to be giving up hope of marriage. Roger conspires with his daughter Edith and her husband Bruce to pressure Deborah, and she eventually accepts Allan's proposal (with the caveat that they wait until the end of the school year, so that a long honeymoon in Europe can be enjoyed). Before the date of the wedding is reached, Bruce is struck by a taxi while standing next to his car in the street. After his death, Edith and her children are forced to return to the family home, until Roger arranges for their return to New Hampshire and the family farm. Deborah's wedding to Allan is delayed as a consequence—she asks him to wait until August. The end of July, however, brings the onset of World War I, and Roger's business loses many of its clients. As a result, he can barely afford to support the family, taking out a mortgage on the home to make ends meet, and Deborah chooses to delay her wedding again until the spring. Given the family's financial straits, Edith's children have to be removed from their expensive private school and tutored from home by Edith herself. After weeks of this, Edith resolves to sell most of her possessions, and use the money for the children's school tuition. Edith also discovers that John, the Irish boy living in the home, has tuberculosis and orders Roger to send him away, which Deborah arranges for her father. Laura, who has been largely absent from family affairs, returns suddenly to the house, arriving with luggage and refusing to see anyone but her sister, Deborah. Her husband, Hal Sloane, has made a large amount of money through war profiteering, but she has fallen in love with his business partner, an Italian, and Hal intends to divorce her, publicly or privately, as a detective has brought him \\"proofs\\" that Laura has been unfaithful to him. Roger, who initially resists the divorce, relents when he learns of his daughter's indiscretions, and she elopes with her lover soon thereafter. As their money troubles worsen, Roger is forced to sell his antique ring collection to cover the family's bills, and tensions increase between Deborah and Edith over money: Deborah raises large amounts of money for \\"her family\\" of tenement schoolchildren, and Edith feels it's wrong of her not to devote her energies to the care of her niece and nephews. Edith is also very hostile to Deborah's \\"modern\\" ideas about women's suffrage, and the resulting arguments are very stressful on Roger. When Roger learns that Deborah has ended her engagement to Allan Baird, he intervenes, informing her that he is fatally ill, and pleading with her to make a life for herself beyond her school. He intends to sell the family home, use most of the funds to set up the family farm in New Hampshire so that George (now 17) can become a farmer and support his mother and siblings, and prepare for death. After she agrees to marry Allan, Roger finds good fortune at last: John, the Irish boy who works for him, discovers a new source of clients and saves the business (and with it, the family home). Roger lives out the end of his days watching Deborah and Allan settle down happily together and have their first child. John, who a doctor had said would never live past 30, falls ill and passes away suddenly, and soon thereafter, Roger falls ill for the final time himself. All of his daughters return to him to make their peace (even Laura, whose new husband allows her to find and reacquire Roger's prized collection of rings), and Roger dies feeling finally connected to his family, as his wife had hoped. ==Characters in His Family== *Roger Gale, a New York businessman in his early 60s *Edith Gale Cunningham, Roger's oldest daughter, in her early 30s *Bruce Cunningham, Edith's husband (a \\"financial surgeon\\" who manages bankrupt businesses) *George Cunningham, Bruce and Edith's oldest son, in his late teens *Elizabeth \\"Betsy\\" Cunningham, Bruce and Edith's only daughter *Deborah Gale Baird, Roger's middle daughter, a school principal *Allan Baird, Deborah's husband, a successful doctor who leaves his practice to treat families living in the tenements *Laura Gale Sloane, Roger's youngest daughter *Hal Sloane, Laura's first husband *John \\"Johnny\\" Geer, a crippled Irish boy who comes to work for Roger ==Literary significance and reception== His Family was praised by many critics at the time of its publication. The Oakland Tribune, in its review on May 27, 1917, said \\"in this story of Roger Gale's family, Ernest Poole has pictured remarkably well present-day Americans. It is significant, intellectual and stimulating--a story of today.\\"S., A. B. (May 27, 1917). \\"His Family, by Ernest Poole\\". Oakland Tribune, p. 1 (Books--Art--Music section). The New York Times profiled the book in its review of \\"notable fiction\\" for 1917, calling it \\"a fine successor to The Harbor [Poole's first novel].\\"\\"The Year's Harvest in Notable Fiction\\". (Dec. 2, 1917). New York Times, pg. BR506. When Poole's first novel, The Harbor came out in 1915 it was a critical and popular success but the Pulitzer Prize did not yet exist. When his second novel His Family came out in 1918, the \\"consensus is that it’s the lesser of the two works, that the Pulitzer committee was really honoring Poole for The Harbor\\".Dennis Drabelle. \\"Book World: Reissue of Ernest Poole’s ‘The Harbor’ long overdue\\", Washington Post, January 13, 2012. ==References to actual history, geography and current science== His Family makes frequent reference to details of life in New York City in the 1910s, particularly to the details of life for the impoverished immigrants whose children attend Deborah's school. George's fascination with \\"modern\\" farming, and his subsequent conversations, offer some details about how the farming of livestock was changing at the time. Finally, the impact of World War I on the business community, the immigrant community, and the lives of families is described in some detail, although few details are given regarding specific wartime incidents (battles, the sinking of passenger ships, etc.). ==Awards and nominations== *The Pulitzer Prize for the Novel, 1918 ==Publication history== *1917, USA, The Macmillan Co., Pub date 16 May 1917, Hardback *1999, USA, Buccaneer Books , Hardback ===First Edition Points=== Published: May 1917; Verso: Copyright 1917 the Macmillan Company; Recto:1917; Boards: Blue embossed cloth; DJ: $1.50 ==Notes* Photos of the first edition of His Family Category:1917 American novels Category:Pulitzer Prize for the Novel-winning works Category:Macmillan Publishers books Category:Novels set in New York City ","title":"His Family"},{"id":"3241273","text":"Eric Matthews (born January 12, 1969, in Compton, California, United States) is an American composer, musician, recording artist, and record producer. ==Career== Eric Matthews began his serious recording career as one half of the band Cardinal.

(2003) \\"Eric Matthews\\", in The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, In 1995, Matthews released his debut solo record on Sub Pop Records. It's Heavy In Here, described as \\"a darkly luxuriant sequence of exquisitely arranged and executed orchestral pop\\", featured the radio hit \\"Fanfare\\" and went on to be a top seller for Sub Pop and received positive reviews while also appearing on many best album lists that year. In 1997, the follow-up album The Lateness of the Hour was released on Sub Pop. It did not sell as well as It's Heavy In Here, but included orchestral instruments within its rock stylings. Sub Pop and Matthews terminated their relationship in 1999, and he began working as a sideman for such groups as Tahiti 80, The Dandy Warhols, Ivy, Man of the Year, Elliott Smith, Paula Kelley, Pugwash, Volovan, and Bug 2000. In 2004, Matthews began a relationship with Empyrean Records to re-issue the Cardinal record. He has since continued to release music under the Empyrean label. In 2005, Matthews released his third solo record, entitled Six Kinds of Passion Looking For An Exit, and in 2006 another album entitled Foundation Sounds. In the summer of 2006, Matthews announced that he and a guitarist from Cleveland named Christopher Seink had formed a new instrumental band called Seinking Ships. In 2008, Eric Matthews and Empyrean Records released The Imagination Stage to a flurry of glowing reviews heralding Eric's return to the fully orchestrated sound of his Sub Pop releases. In March 2009, Eric ended his professional relationship with Empyrean Records. In 2013 Eric joined the band SheLoom.

For the 2003–04 season, he was loaned to NAC Breda. After his contract had expired in 2006, he joined French league side Nantes. However, his stay with the French side turned out to be a disappointment, so he was sent on loan to AZ in January 2007. Although not unsuccessful, AZ chose not to buy him and Boukhari returned to Nantes, which was relegated to the Ligue 2. Boukhari was reluctant to play in the second division and on 7 July he returned to Sparta Rotterdam, where he signed a contract for three years. Back at the club where it all started for him, Boukhari became club captain and the face of the 100-year Anniversary of the club. After spending a season with Sparta Rotterdam, Boukhari was approached early in the transfer window by Saudi Arabian club Al- Ittihad. However, the Saudi Arabian side then refused to pay the transfer fee to Sparta, instead of paying the fee, sending a lawyer to declare that they wanted to cancel the deal. Al-Ittihad manager Gabriel Calderón was reportedly unhappy about Boukhari's lack of match fitness, and asked the board to cancel the transfer. However, the Eredivisie side wanted the transfer to go through: \\"The transfer is a done deal and we expect to receive the money into our account,\\" said director Peter Bonthuis. The Rotterdam side submitted a complaint to FIFA regarding the Saudi Arabian club's sudden change of action. In January 2009, Boukhari signed a contract until the end of the season with NAC Breda.

The Liberals wanted to eliminate the political, economic, and cultural power of the Catholic church as well as reduce the role of the Mexican Army. Both the Catholic Church and the Army were protected by corporate or institutional privileges (fueros) established in the colonial era. Liberals sought to create a modern nation- state founded on liberal principles. The Conservatives wanted a centralist government, some even a monarchy, with the Church and military keeping their traditional roles and powers, and with landed and merchant elites maintaining their dominance over the majority mixed-race and indigenous populations of Mexico. This struggle erupted into a full-scale civil war when the Liberals, then in control of the government after ousting Antonio López de Santa Anna, began to implement a series of laws designed to strip the Church and military—but especially the Church—of its privileges and property. The liberals passed a series of separate laws implementing their vision of Mexico, and then promulgated the Constitution of 1857, which gave constitutional force to their program. Conservative resistance to this culminated in the Plan of Tacubaya, which ousted the government of President Ignacio Comonfort in a coup d'état and took control of Mexico City, forcing the Liberals to move their government to the city of Veracruz. The Conservatives controlled the capital and much of central Mexico, while the rest of the states had to choose whether to side with the Conservative government of Félix Zuloaga or Liberal government of Benito Juárez. The Liberals lacked military experience and lost most of the early battles, but the tide turned when Conservatives twice failed to take the liberal stronghold of Veracruz. The government of U.S. President James Buchanan recognized the Juárez regime in April 1859 and the U.S. and the government of Juárez negotiated the McLane-Ocampo Treaty, which if ratified would have given the Liberal regime cash but also granted the U.S. transit rights through Mexican territory. Liberal victories accumulated thereafter until Conservative forces surrendered in December 1860. While the Conservative forces lost the war, guerrillas remained active in the countryside for years after, and Conservatives in Mexico would conspire with French forces to install Maximilian I as emperor during the following French Intervention in Mexico. ==Liberals vs. Conservatives in post-Independence Mexico== After the end of the Mexican War of Independence, the country was strongly divided as it tried to recover from more than a decade of fighting. From 1821-57, 50 different governments ruled the country. These included dictatorships, constitutional republican governments and a monarchy. The political division was roughly divided into two groups, the Liberals and the Conservatives. The Liberal political movements had their beginnings in the secret meetings of the Freemasonry. The secret nature of the society allowed for discreet political discussion. Conservatives favored a strong centralized government, with many wanting a European-style monarchy. Conservatives favored protecting many of the institutions inherited from the colonial period, including tax and legal exemptions for the Catholic Church and the military. Liberals favored the establishment of a federalist republic based on ideas coming out of the European Enlightenment, and the limiting of the Church's and military's privileges. Until the end of the Reform period Mexico's history would be dominated by these two factions vying for control and fighting against foreign incursions at the same time. The Reform Era of Mexican history is generally defined from 1855-76. ==Liberals take power in the 1850s== thumbleft250px Soldiers of the Reformation 1858. The Liberals ousted conservative Antonio López de Santa Anna under the Plan of Ayutla in 1855, bringing Juan Álvarez of the state of Guerrero to the presidency. Liberals exiled to the U.S. during the late Santa Anna regime, Melchor Ocampo and Benito Juárez returned to Mexico, and other Liberals came to national prominence, including Miguel Lerdo de Tejada and his younger brother, Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada. This ascendancy came after the loss of about half of Mexico's national territory to the US in the Mexican–American War. Liberals believed that the entrenched power of the Roman Catholic Church and the military were the source of most of Mexico's problems. The Liberals' challenge to the Catholic Church's hegemony in Mexico came about in stages even before the 1850s. State-level measures adopted since the 1820s and the reform measures of during the regime of Valentín Gómez Farías led conservatives to defend Mexico's Catholic identity, including integration of Church and State. This included Catholic newspapers such as La Cruz and conservative groups that strongly attacked Liberal policies and ideology. This ideology had roots in the European Enlightenment, which sought to reduce the role of the Catholic Church in society. The Reforms began in the 1830s and 1840s coalesced into the principal laws of the Reform era, which were passed in two phases, from 1855–57 and then from 1858–60. The 1857 Constitution of Mexico was promulgated near the end of the first phase. More Reform laws were passed from 1861–63 and after 1867 when the Liberals emerged victorious after two civil wars with Conservative opponents. ==The Liberal Reform== Miguel Lerdo de Tejada drafted the law to disentail the lands of the Catholic Church and those of indigenous communities. Alegoría de la Constitución de 1857 shows a dark complexioned Mexican woman clutching the liberal Constitution of 1857. The 1869 painting by Petronilo Monroy was completed after the expulsion of the French in 1867. The success of the Plan of Ayutla brought rebel Juan Álvarez to the Mexican presidency. Alvarez was a \\"puro\\" and appointed other radical Liberals to important posts, including Benito Juárez as Minister of Justice, Miguel Lerdo de Tejada as Minister of Development and Melchor Ocampo as Minister of Foreign Affairs. The first of the Liberal Reform Laws were passed in 1855. The Juárez Law, named after Benito Juárez, restricted clerical privileges, specifically the authority of Church courts, by subordinating their authority to civil law. It was conceived of as a moderate measure, rather than abolishing church courts altogether. However, the move opened latent divisions in the country. Archbishop Lázaro de la Garza (es) in Mexico City condemned the Law as an attack on the Church itself, and clerics went into rebellion in the city of Puebla in 1855–56. Other laws attacked the privileges traditionally enjoyed by the military, which was significant since the military had been instrumental in putting and keeping Mexican governments in office since Emperor Agustín de Iturbide in the 1820s. The next Reform Law was called the Lerdo law, after Miguel Lerdo de Tejada. Under this new law the government began to confiscate Church land. This proved to be considerably more controversial than the Juárez Law. The purpose of the law was to convert lands held by corporate entities such as the Church into private property, favoring those who already lived on it. It was thought that this would encourage development and the government could raise revenue by taxing the process. Lerdo de Tejada was the Minister of Finance and required that the Church sell much of its urban and rural land at reduced prices. If the Church did not comply, the government would hold public auctions. The Law also stated that the Church could not gain possession of properties in the future. However, the Lerdo law did not apply only to the Church. It stated that no corporate body could own land. Broadly defined, this would include ejidos, or communal land owned by Indian villages. Initially, these ejidos were exempt from the law, but eventually Indian communities suffered an extensive loss of land. By 1857 additional anti-clerical legislation, such as the Iglesias law (named after José María Iglesias), regulated the collection of clerical fees from the poor and prohibited clerics from charging for baptisms, marriages or funeral services. Marriage became a civil contract, although no provision for divorce was authorized. Registry of births, marriages and deaths became a civil affair, with President Benito Juárez registering his newly-born son in Veracruz. The number of religious holidays was reduced and several holidays to commemorate national events introduced. Religious celebrations outside churches was forbidden, use of church bells restricted and clerical dress was prohibited in public. One other significant Reform Law was the Law for the Nationalization of Ecclesiastical Properties, which would eventually secularize nearly all of the country's monasteries and convents. The government had hoped that this law would bring in enough revenue to secure a loan from the US, but sales would prove disappointing from the time it was passed all the way to the early 20th century. As these laws were being passed, Congress debated a new Constitution. Delegates were concerned with the precedents established by the first of the Reform Laws and the issue of whether Mexico would have a central, authoritarian government or a federal republic. In the end, the Constitution of 1857 established a centralist component. Since the constitution did not establish the Catholic Church as the official and exclusive religious institution, it was a major step in the separation of church and state. ==Civil war== General Félix Zuloaga, conservative president of Mexico during the Reform War. General Miguel Miramón Each of the Reform Laws met strong resistance from Conservatives, the Church and the military, culminating in military action and war. After the Juárez Law, General Tomás Mejía (1820 – 1867) rebelled against the Liberal government in the defense of the Catholic identity of Mexico in the Sierra Gorda region of Querétaro. Mejía would conduct operations against Liberal forces for the next eight years. Opposition to the Lerdo Law and the 1857 Constitution culminated in a takeover of Mexico City by Conservative forces. This operation was called the Plan of Tacubaya. When the military took control of Mexico City, then president Ignacio Comonfort agreed to the Plan's terms, but Benito Juárez, then president of the Supreme Court, defended the 1857 Constitution. Juárez was arrested. Comonfort was subsequently forced to resign and Gen. Félix Zuloaga was put in his place. After arriving in Mexico City, Zuloaga's supporters closed Congress and arrested liberal politicians, preparing to write a new constitution for the country. The Plan of Tacubaya deeply divided the country, with each state deciding whether to support the Liberals' 1857 Constitution or the Conservatives' takeover of Mexico City. Juárez escaped prison and fled to the city of Querétaro. He was recognized as the Liberals' interim president. As Zuloaga and the army took over more of the central part of Mexico, Juárez and his government were forced to the fortified city of Veracruz. From there the Liberal government had control over the state of Veracruz and a number of allied states in the north and central-west. The Liberal government would be located in Veracruz from 1858-61. Full hostilities between Liberal and Conservative forces raged from 1858-60. The Conservatives controlled Mexico City, but not Veracruz. Twice in 1860 Conservative forces under Gen. Miguel Miramón tried to take the city but failed. From there Juárez directed the opposition movement, from which the Liberals obtained supplies and money through duties received in the port city. At the beginning of the war Liberal leaders and armies lacked the military experience of the Conservatives, who were backed by Mexico's official military. In fact, the liberals lost many of the first battles. However, as hostilities continued, Liberal forces gained experience and obtained aid from the US that would eventually enable victories for the Liberal side. On March 6 of that year, two ships previously acquired by the Conservative government were prevented from entering the city by a US naval force, acting in support of the Liberal faction of Benito Juarez. The force fleet attacked the Mexican ships and arrested their crews, eventually kidnapping Mexican marines and taking them to New Orleans. This incident is known as the Battle of Anton Lizardo. In the same year Conservative forces were defeated in Oaxaca and Guadalajara. In December 1860 Gen. Miramón surrendered outside of Mexico City. Liberal forces reoccupied the capital on 1 January 1861, with Benito Juárez joining them a week later. Despite the Liberals regaining control of the capital, bands of Conservative guerrillas operated in rural areas. Miramón went into exile to Cuba and Europe. However, Gen. Márquez remained active and Mejía operated from his stronghold in the Sierra Gorda until the end of the French Intervention in Mexico. ==The Juárez government up to the French Intervention== Benito Juárez Juárez's interim presidency was confirmed by his election in March 1861. However, the Liberals' celebrations of 1861 were short-lived. The war had severely damaged Mexico's infrastructure and crippled its economy. While the Conservatives had been defeated, they would not disappear and the Juárez government had to respond to pressures from these factions. One of these concessions was amnesty to captured Conservative guerrillas who were still resisting the Juárez government, even though these same guerrillas were executing captured Liberals, one of whom was Melchor Ocampo. Juárez also faced external pressures from countries such as Great Britain, Spain and France owing to the large amounts indebted to them by Mexico. Conservative factions in Mexico, who still wanted a European-style monarchy, would eventually conspire with the French government to install Mexico's second emperor during the French Intervention in Mexico. ==See also== *La Reforma *Constitution of 1857 *Mexican–American War *Pastry War *Second French intervention in Mexico *List of wars involving Mexico Battles in the Reform War: * March 8–9, 1858 * March 9–10, 1858 * Early spring 1858 * July 2, 1858 * September 18, 1858 * September 29, 1858 * December 14, 1858 * December 26, 1858 * August 10, 1860 ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:Conflicts in 1857 Category:Conflicts in 1858 Category:Conflicts in 1859 Category:Conflicts in 1860 Category:Conflicts in 1861 04 Category:1857 in Mexico Category:1858 in Mexico Category:1859 in Mexico Category:1860 in Mexico Category:1861 in Mexico Category:Civil wars involving the states and peoples of North America Category:Second French intervention in Mexico Category:Wars involving Mexico Category:19th century in Mexico Category:Conservatism in Mexico Category:Liberalism in Mexico Category:Civil wars of the Industrial era ","title":"Reform War"},{"id":"3241299","text":"Lee Valley Ice Centre The Lee Valley Ice Centre is situated in the Lee Valley Regional Park in London, England.

His aliases included Joseph \\"Joe\\" Morris, Joe Marvin, William \\"Bill\\" Delaney, and Edward \\"Eddie\\" Delaney. Eastman is considered to be one of the last of the 19th- century New York City gangsters who preceded the rise of Arnold Rothstein and the Jewish mob. Later, more sophisticated, organized criminal enterprises also included the predominately Italian Cosa Nostra. ==Early life== Monk was born Edward Eastman in 1875 in the Corlear's Hook section of lower Manhattan to Samuel Eastman, a Civil War veteran and wallpaper-hanger, and his wife Mary (Parks) Eastman. They were descended from English ancestors of the colonial period. By the time Monk was five, his father had abandoned the family. Mary moved with her children to her father George Parks' home on the Upper East Side. According to the 1880 United States Census, 5-year-old Edward Eastman lived with his mother and other family on East Seventy-Fifth Street, in Manhattan. The household was headed by his maternal grandfather George Parks, age 68, who worked in a dry goods store. Parks was born in New York, as were both his parents. In addition to Edward, the Eastman family included Mary Eastman, age 35; and her daughters Lizzie, age 10; Ida, age 8; and Francine, age 3. Everyone was born in Manhattan, with the exception of Lizzie, who was born in California. Both George Parks and his daughter Mary Eastman were recorded as having been divorced. In the 1870 U.S. census, Mary Eastman had been living on Cannon Street in the Lower East Side of Manhattan with her husband Samuel Eastman, age 40, born in New York and working as a paper hanger. Living with them were their children Lizzie and Willie, age 3, born in New York. Willie likely died young, as he was not listed with the family in 1880. In the 1860 census, Samuel Eastman was living as a single man in Manhattan in the household of Thomas McSpedon, from a prominent old NYC family. His mentor's firm, McSpedon & Baker, on Pine Street in New York, was the official printer for the city government. In addition to running his business, McSpedon served as an elected Alderman in NYC and as appointed City Fire Marshall during the mid-19th century. Eastman worked as a paper hanger. By the 1900 census, Mary Eastman lived in Queens on Curtis Avenue, with her daughters Elizabeth and Francine and their families. Edward Eastman was not listed in any censuses after 1880 (the 1890 records were lost in a fire at the National Archives). Going by the nickname \\"Monk\\", Eastman was not recorded as having been arrested until after his grandfather died. At some point Parks helped his grandson set up a pet shop on Broome Street. For years after being widely known as a gangster, Eastman listed \\"bird seller\\" as his occupation on government forms. At some point he returned to live on the Lower East Side and became involved with the neighborhood gangs made up of poor, young men, often children of immigrants. Operations included a bike rental racket.Anna Merlan, \\"Monk Eastman, A Pigeon-Loving Gangster From Williamsburg\\", 27 November 2013, Village Voice ===Ethnicity=== Monk Eastman's ancestry has been a subject of debate by reporters and historians. Because his criminal enterprise involved so many members of Jewish-American organized crime, Eastman is frequently depicted as being Jewish (including by some newspapers of his period). But researchers have documented that he appears to have been of ethnic Protestant English descent.Hanson, pp.13–14. Records suggest that he was Christian and Protestant, if non-practicing. In his book The Jews of Sing Sing, the writer Ron Arons notes that none of Monk's sisters (nor his parents) was married in Jewish ceremonies. His maternal grandfather George Parks died in a Baptist rest home.Arons, p. 53. When Eastman was buried, his service was performed by a Methodist pastor.Hanson, p.14. ==Criminal career== In 1898 Monk Eastman was arrested and convicted of larceny under the alias William Murray (one of the many Irish aliases which he used). He was jailed for three months on Blackwell's Island. During this time, he belonged to a gang of pimps and thieves known as the Allen Street Cadets. The writer Herbert Asbury described Eastman as having a messy head of wild hair, wearing a derby two sizes too small for his head, sporting numerous gold-capped teeth, and often parading around shirtless or in tatters, always accompanied by his cherished pigeons. He had a broad five-foot-six inch frame. In time, Monk's reputation as a tough guy earned him the job of \\"sheriff\\" or bouncer at the New Irving Hall, a celebrated club on Broome Street, not far from his pet shop. At the New Irving Hall and Silver Dollar Smith's Saloon, Eastman became acquainted with Tammany Hall politicians, who were powerful in New York and deeply involved with the ethnic immigrant communities. They eventually put him and his cohort to work as \\"repeat voters\\" in elections and strong-arm men to intimidate the opposition. Paul Kelly, illustration by William Oberhardt, 1909 Eastman's greatest rival was Paul Kelly (born Paolo Antonio Vaccarelli), immigrant leader of the majority-Italian Five Points Gang. In 1900, at the turn of the 20th century, Eastman lived at 221 E. 5th Street, about two blocks from Kelly's New Brighton Social Club at 57 Great Jones Street.The warfare between these two gangs reached a fever pitch on September 17, 1903, with a protracted gun battle on Rivington Street among dozens of gangsters. One gang member was killed and a second reported fatally wounded,The Minneapolis Journal. September 16, 1903, Image 16 reports Michael Donovan was killed and John Carroll probably was fatally wounded by a policeman.The Evening World, (New York, N.Y.), September 16, 1903, Image 4: Carroll had been shot by a detective after having been seen shooting a gunThe Sun. (New York [N.Y.]) September 21, 1903, Image 10 report of Donovan funeral Numerous innocent civilians were injured. Some 18 members of the Eastman gang were reported as arrested.The Evening World.

September 23, 1903, Night Edition, Image 2 arrest of Driga \\"Bridget\\" ColomaThe Evening World, September 24, 1903, Night edition, image 1 arrest of 3 members of gang Tammany Hall worked closely with both Kelly and Eastman to mobilize their members in elections and patronage schemes. Its officials grew tired of the feuding and the bad press generated when civilians were killed or injured in the gangs' cross-fire. In 1903, Tammany Hall set up a boxing match between Eastman and Kelly in an old barn in the Bronx to settle the feuding. The fight lasted two hours, with both men taking hard punishment before it was called a draw. The politicians pressed the leaders to call a truce and end the street violence. ==Prison== On February 3, 1904, Eastman tried to rob a young man on 42nd Street and Broadway in Manhattan. As the man was being followed by two Pinkerton agents hired by the man's family to keep him out of trouble in the city, the agents intervened. Eastman shot at them while escaping, but was caught by policemen responding to the shooting. Tired of bad publicity from Eastman, Tammany Hall refused to help him. Later that year, Eastman was convicted of attempted assault and sentenced to 10 years in prison at Sing Sing penitentiary. Monk Eastman, circa 1910-1920 In 1909, Eastman was released after serving five years in prison. During his absence, the Eastman Gang had split into several factions; one of his top men, Max Zwerbach, was dead. Since none of the surviving gang factions wanted Eastman as their leader, he was effectively out of power. For several years, Eastman reverted to petty thievery. During this period, he became addicted to opium and served several short jail terms. ==Military service== After the United States entered World War I in 1917, the 42-year-old Eastman decided to join the army. During his military physical, the doctor observed all the knife and bullet scars on Eastman's body and asked him which wars he had been in. Eastman replied, \\"Oh! A lot of little wars around New York.\\"Ashbury, p.256. He served in France with \\"O'Ryan's Roughnecks,\\" the 106th Infantry Regiment of the 27th Infantry Division. After Eastman's discharge in 1919, the Governor of New York, Al Smith, recognized his honorable service by restoring his US citizenship. (Voting rights had been removed by his conviction as a felon.) ==Final years and death== After his discharge from the army, Eastman quickly returned to a life of petty crime. One of his partners was Jerry Bohan, a corrupt Prohibition agent. On the morning of December 26, 1920, Eastman and Bohan met with other men at the Bluebird Cafe in Lower Manhattan. Around 4:00 am, they argued over money, with Eastman and Bohan particularly at odds. When Bohan left, Eastman followed him and accused him of being a rat. Feeling threatened, Bohan fatally shot Eastman several times with his pistol. Eastman was buried with full military honors in Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.Hanson, pp.292–294. Bohan was later convicted of his murder and served three years in prison.

The building is now the centerpiece of the city's Barnsdall Art Park. In July 2019, along with seven other buildings designed by Wright in the 20th century, it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The Hollyhock House is noted for developing an influential architectural aesthetic, which combined indoor and outdoor living spaces. It is the first time modern American architecture has been recognized on the World Heritage List. ==History== Aline Barnsdall originally intended the house to be part of an arts and live-theater complex on a property known as Olive Hill, but the larger project was never completed. This was Wright's second project in California (the first one being the George C. Stewart House, 1909, in Montecito). Atypically for Wright, he was not able to personally supervise much of the construction due to his preoccupation with designing the Imperial Hotel in Japan at the time. He delegated many of the responsibilities involved in completing the house to his assistant, Rudolph Schindler, and his son, Lloyd Wright. Wright was fired from the project in 1921 due to cost overages on the project. Disillusioned by the costs of construction and maintenance, Barnsdall donated the house to the city of Los Angeles in 1927 under the stipulation that a fifteen-year lease be given to the California Art Club for its headquarters. The club was there until 1942 when the house was almost demolished. The house has been used as an art gallery and as a United Service Organizations (USO) facility over the years. Beginning in 1974, the city sponsored a series of restorations, but the structure was damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. It was again restored, and was open to the public as of June 2005. The U.S. Department of the Interior designated Hollyhock House a National Historic Landmark in 2007. It was the seventh site in the city of Los Angeles to receive that designation. The house was included in a list of all time \\"top ten\\" Los Angeles houses in a Los Angeles Times survey of experts in December 2008. Lighted pool and long lines at the re-opening, 2015 In 2005, Project Restore initiated a 10-year restoration project. Project Restore is a non-profit organization dedicated \\"to the historic restoration and preservation of the civic integrity of the City of Los Angeles.\\" The restoration included work on the building's floor, wood, doors, windows, art stone, and plaster. The restored building was opened to the public in 2015. In January 2015 it was announced that, following extensive renovations, the house would once again open for tours on 13 February. The 24-hour event drew large crowds through the night, with many waiting in line for over three hours for admittance. In 2015, the National Park Service submitted the Hollyhock House along with nine other Frank Lloyd Wright properties to a tentative list for designation as World Heritage Site. Revised proposals were submitted in 2018. Eight properties were ultimately inscribed on the World Heritage List as part of a submission called, \\"The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright\\" in July 2019. When Hollyhock House together with the seven other buildings in the US were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List, it was the first time that modern American architecture had been recognized by that organization. == Features == Southwest terrace detail with abstracted Hollyhock blossom reliefs. As with many of Wright's residences, it has an \\"introverted\\" exterior with windows that seem hidden from the outside, and is not easy to decode from the outside. The house is arranged around a central courtyard with one side open to form a kind of theatrical stage (never used as such), and a complex system of split levels, steps and roof terraces around that courtyard. The design features exterior walls that are tilted back at 85 degrees (which helps provide a \\"Mayan\\" appearance sometimes referred to as the Mayan Revival style), leaded art glass in the windows, a grand fireplace with a large abstract bas-relief, and a moat. Water is meant to flow from a pool in the courtyard through a tunnel to this inside moat, and out again to a fountain. The front doors are stepped similarly to the entryway. The split doors rest on pins and swing open easily despite their massive weight. The keyhole is concealed with a decorative flap. The hollyhock (Aline Barnsdale's favorite flower) is used as a central theme to the house, with many symmetrical decorations adapting the plant's general appearance. Planters are decorated with the motif and filled with the plants themselves, and Wright's stained glass windows feature a highly stylized hollyhock pattern. An interesting feature is the mitered glass corners at the windows; an early idea Wright later used at Fallingwater. Hollyhock House features an entertainment room immediately to the right of the entrance. This room contains possibly the first built-in entertainment center, complete with LP-sized cabinets along the floor. Other notable rooms include a child's play area as well as a modernist kitchen, which long housed the museum gift shop. Like many houses designed by Wright, it proved to be better as an aesthetic work than as a livable dwelling. Water tended to flow over the central lawn and into the living room, and the flat roof terraces were conceived without an understanding of Los Angeles' rains. The cantilevered concrete also did not stand up well to the area's earthquakes. There were a considerable number of revisions. Two smaller structures, called Studio Residence A and B, were built on the grounds. Residence A still stands. The client also commissioned a private kindergarten which was never built. The property also includes a smaller building designed by modernist architect Richard Neutra. ==Use in film production== The house and grounds were used as the temple of the Piranha Women in 1989's Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death. ==Friends of Hollyhock House (FOHH)== The FOHH provide an increased public awareness of Frank Lloyd Wright, Aline Barnsdall, and Hollyhock House through public tours, special events, and the Friends of Hollyhock House Library. The library is a small research library that contains books and articles on Frank Lloyd Wright and Aline Barnsdall. All docents are members of the Friends of Hollyhock House. ==Gallery== Image:Hollyhock House entrance.JPGTunnel-like entrance with hollyhock carvings File:Hollyhock House Living Room HABS CAL,19-LOSAN,28-10.jpgHollyhock House living room, with fireplace and skylight (toward the southeast, 1965) The fireplace hood features a geometric sculptured relief by Wright.

The Constitutional Law PAC has a center-right orientation. Conservatives have expressed concerns that the group's leadership is too liberal, while liberals have criticized the committee as a conservative attempt to influence judicial elections. ==Candidate Evaluation Committee== The Candidate Evaluation Committee was chaired by Former King County Prosecutor Christopher T. Bayley a moderate Republican. Members of the committee were Seattle labor attorney Jerry Rubin of the law firm Stoel Rives (Democrat), Chehalis attorney Renee’ Remund of the firm Vander Stoep, Remund and Blinks (Republican) and Senior Pierce County Deputy Prosecutor Phil Sorenson (Democrat). In 2006 the committee formed a bi- partisan Candidate Evaluation Committee to issue rating for appellate level judicial candidates in Washington State. The committee issued two ratings for each candidate: \\"Judicial Qualifications\\" and \\"Judicial Philosophy\\". ===Judicial Qualifications=== The Judicial Qualifications rating relied on similar criteria to those used by the King County Bar Association and other bar associations. The possible ratings were “Very Well Qualified”, “Well Qualified”, “Qualified” and “Unqualified”. ===Judicial Philosophy=== The committee based its \\"Judicial Philosophy\\" rating reflects on their understanding of a candidate’s “deference to the law, constitution and established legal precedent.” An “A” was used to indicate that the candidate showed complete deference to the law, constitution and established legal precedent. A “B” was awarded for significant deference, a “C” for partial deference, a “D” for insufficient deference and an “F” for little or no deference. ===Ratings=== The committee rated four incumbent judges as “Very Well Qualified”, Chief Justice Gerry L. Alexander, Judge Ronald E. Cox of the Court of Appeals, Judge Marlin Appelwick of the Court of Appeals, and Judge David Armstrong of the Court of Appeals.

The wings and crown are rust-colored. This sparrow has a conical, yellow-based bill and a long brown tail. ==Distribution and habitat== P. carpalis is a year-round resident from south-central Arizona and Guadalupe Canyon, New Mexico, south to northern Sinaloa, Mexico. The rufous-winged sparrow inhabits desert grasslands with scattered mesquite or cholla. It also occurs in washes with sandy bottoms and vegetated slopes, brushy irrigation ditches, and creeks bordered by broad-leaved trees, mesquite, grasses, and forbs. ==Diet== During the breeding season, adult rufous-winged sparrows feed on a variety of insects, caught on the wing or gleaned off plant surfaces. At other times, the bird eats seeds. ==Breeding== Rufous-winged sparrows usually breed during the monsoon months of July and August. The nest is built low in small trees, bushes, or cactus, including hackberry, palo verde, cholla, and mesquite. The average clutch size is four; pairs may have two broods per year. ==Status== This species is listed as a migratory bird under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. ==History in Pima County, Arizona== The rufous-winged sparrow in Pima County: This species was discovered by Charles Emil Bendire in 1872, near old Fort Lowell, Tucson, where it was common. In 1881, the sparrow was found \\"sparingly about Tucson and Camp Lowell. It inhabited the mesquite thickets, keeping closely hidden in the bunches of 'sacaton' grass, from which, when flushed, it flew into the branches above.\\" By the late 1880s, the species was probably extirpated from Arizona, perhaps as a result of overgrazing. The species began to recover in the United States around 1936, and is now found in appropriate habitat throughout much of eastern Pima County, Santa Cruz County, and western Cochise County. Loss of habitat as a result of overgrazing and urban development is believed to have had the greatest effect on populations. ==References== * ==Further reading== ;Books *Lowther, P. E., K. D.

He established the Royal City of Nueva Cáceres, now known as Naga City. ==Early career== A native of Cáceres and a relative of Álvaro de Sande, he served as attorney, criminal judge, and auditor in Mexico. He succeeded Guido de Lavezaris, a member of the 1543 Ruy López de Villalobos Expedition from Barra de Navidad, Jalisco, México, on August 25, 1575. In 1575, King Philip II of Spain appointed him as the governor-general of the Philippines. ==Governorship== One of his first acts of political advocacy was to disestablish vast encomiendas of wealthy Spaniards in the Philippines. In 1576, he issued a decree forbidding all officials appointed by the Crown to own encomiendas that were initially for Indios. He also established the city of Nueva Cáceres, province of Camarines Sur, Bicol region, Island of Luzon, the largest of the some 7,107 islands (under Spanish Administration till 1898, for some 350–370 years), Philippine Islands. A few years after, Spanish and Dominican prelate Domingo de Salazar requested to create monasteries for the Dominicans; this was granted by Sande through King Philip II's royal decree. During his time, the first Augustinian priests arrived to Manila on July 1, 1577, coming from Acapulco, Mexico. Also in 1577, the Church of San Agustin was erected at the same city. He also commissioned an expedition to Borneo in 1578, where the Sultan of Jolo became a vassal of Spain through a peace treaty signed at Río Grande de Mindanao. That same year, he attacked Borneo, and the sultan of that sultanate (present day Brunei) became submissive to the Spanish officials of Manila. He also showed eagerness to conquer Moluccas from the Portuguese as well as China. In 1579, he sent an expedition again, headed by Captain Gabriel de Ribera to Mindanao and Jolo, to secure Moro submission to Spanish authority. He went to the Rio Grande to find nothing but remnants of villages abandoned by the locals. He then established a fortress for the villages and went north to pacify the rebelling Butuanons. Upon his return to Luzon, Ribera met some natives from Jolo with little tribute, saying that they had nothing to give to the Spaniards since the Portuguese Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa had recently attacked their settlements. In the same year, he denied the Franciscan fathers their burning wishes, after some 19,000 km. travel, to enter China to spread Catholicism, the Chinese being stupefied when some of them disobeyed the Manila Spanish Civil Authorities and arrived at the highly controlled Portuguese trade city of Macao, where they found that they did not carry weapons, money or goods to exchange but only some religious liturgical ware for their own use and Catholic books. He also became an auditor in the Audiencia of Mexico. ==See also== *Limahong ==References== Category:People from Cáceres, Spain Category:1540 births Category:1627 deaths Category:University of Salamanca alumni ","title":"Francisco de Sande"},{"id":"3241335","text":"\\"Heart and Soul\\" is a popular song composed by Hoagy Carmichael with lyrics by Frank Loesser. It charted with different artists between 1938 and 1961. A simplified version is a popular piano duet. == Musical format == The song's A-section is often simplified as a repeating I-vi-IV-V progression and taught to beginning piano students as an easy two-hand duet (), with one person playing the bass and another playing the melody.The Bouncy Joy of 'Heart and Soul', All Things Considered, NPR, December 31 2006 Much like the piece \\"Chopsticks\\", this (somewhat inaccurate) version became widely known, even to those who never studied piano, and is sometimes mistakenly thought to be a folk tune. The chord progression, often referred to as the \\"50s progression\\", was employed in the doo-wop hits of the 1950s and 1960s. ==Early versions== In 1938, it was performed by Larry Clinton and his orchestra with vocals by Bea Wain. In 1939, three versions reached the music charts: Larry Clinton (No. 1), Eddy Duchin (No. 12), and Al Donahue (No. 16). A version by The Four Aces with the Jack Pleis Orchestra reached No. 11 in 1952, and a version by Johnny Maddox reached No. 57 in 1956. In 1961, The Cleftones version reached No. 18 and the one by Jan and Dean reached No. 25. == The Cleftones version == The Cleftones succeeded with a rhythm and blues rearrangement of the song in 1961. After the release on April 17, 1961, \\"Heart and Soul\\" reached number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 in July of that year, making this song The Cleftones' most popular work. In 1959, the Cleftones' manager, George Goldner, convinced the group that their future resided in re-recording existing songs with an established popularity. By this time, Charles James had grown more proficient on the guitar, and the group and Goldner used that to develop a new arrangement of the piece. At that time, a local prominent disc jockey set up a recording session in Rochester, New York, to record \\"Heart and Soul\\" and, arranged for singer Pat Spann's boyfriend Panama Francis to play drums and 15-year-old/future Grammy Award winner Duane Hitchings to play keyboards. At the recording session, the group was presented with a rearrangement of \\"Heart and Soul\\" that was more formal than they had practiced. The group added unexpected rhythms to give the song a syncopated feel. \\"Heart and Soul\\" sat undistributed until 1961. In early April of that year, Roulette Records president Morris Levy reactivated New York-based American record label Gee Records as a division of Roulette Records and made \\"Heart and Soul\\" the reactivated label's first release. That same month, American news magazine Billboard Music Week review panel listed \\"The Cleftones; Heart and Soul (Famous, ASCAP) (1:52) Gee\\" as one of seventeen \\"Pick Hits\\" from all songs released in the week of April 17, 1961. Under its \\"Spotlight Winners of the Week\\" column, Billboard identified the song as having the strongest sales potential of all records reviewed for the week, commenting on The Cleftones and \\"Heart and Soul,\\" On July 3, 1961, \\"Heart and Soul\\" reached number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100, and No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 R&B; chart. The recording eventually sold approximately 350,000 copies for Gee/Roulette. In 1973, the Cleftones version was used in the movie American Graffiti. Music critic Terry Atkinson of the Palm Beach Post noted in 1990 that \\"Heart and Soul\\" is the song for which the Cleftones are best remembered. In 1999, American music critic Dave Marsh listed The Cleftones' \\"Heart and Soul\\" as number 913 in his book, The Heart of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made. In 2012, American author and essayist Ray Schuck noted that the lyrics, \\"Well, I know that you're in love with him, 'cause I saw you dancing in the gym/You both kicked off your shoes – man, I dig those rhythm and blues.\\" —from Don McLean's song \\"American Pie might be a vague reference to the Cleftones' 1961 rhythm and blues song, \\"Heart and Soul.\\" In his essay, Schuck argued that such as reference would \\"segue nicely into the verses comprising the remainder of this stanza, albeit with a disappointing outcome.\\" == Jan and Dean version == Jan and Dean covered the song at the same time as the Cleftones's record was on the chart. They intended for it to be released on Liberty Records, who balked, and it was released on Gene Autry's Challenge Records instead. It reached No. 25 on the charts. Liberty, noting the success, signed them, and Jan and Dean went on to make five top-ten singles for the label (\\"Surf City\\", \\"Honolulu Lulu\\", \\"Drag City\\", \\"Deadman's Curve\\", and \\"The Little Old Lady from Pasadena\\"). == Uses in other media == In 1980, an improvised piano version was performed in The Competition. In the 1988 fantasy comedy film Big, this is the tune played on the giant piano at FAO Schwarz in the scene where the characters portrayed by Robert Loggia and Tom Hanks perform a duet in front of other customers. In the TV sitcom Frasier, during the 1998 Season 5, Episode 20 titled \\"First Date\\", the tune and song is sung by Niles and Daphne during a memorable and important scene as they slice vegetables. In Frasier during the 2001 Season 8, Episode 18 titled \\"Daphne Returns\\", the scene and song from Season 5 Episode 20 is referenced as a flashback. In the 2016 TV series Lucifer, the tune is played during a scene from Season 1, Episode 9 where the characters portrayed by Tom Ellis and Lauren German perform a piano duet of Heart and Soul. \\"Play That Song,\\" a single by the band Train that incorporates portions of the melody, reached No. 41 in 2016. In 2017, a couple performed a duet of the tune in front of a crowd at Weserpark, a shopping mall in Bremen, Germany. As of June 2020, the video has since reached over 5 million views on YouTube. == See also == * \\"Blue Moon\\" * \\"Der Flohwalzer\\" * I Love the World, advertising adaptation * \\"Play That Song\\" (Train song), a 2016 adaptation * List of 1930s jazz standards * List of songs containing the 50s progression == References == == External links == * \\"The Bouncy Joy of 'Heart and Soul'\\" on All Things Considered, December 31, 2006 Category:1930s jazz standards Category:1938 songs Category:1961 singles Category:American rhythm and blues songs Category:Doo- wop songs Category:Gee Records singles Category:The Four Aces songs Category:Jan and Dean songs Category:Number-one singles in the United States Category:Songs with music by Hoagy Carmichael Category:Songs written by Frank Loesser ","title":"Heart and Soul (Frank Loesser and Hoagy Carmichael song)"},{"id":"3241341","text":"Transdnieper (Ukrainian: Russian: Заднепровье, Polish: Zadnieprze) is a historical steppe region from the right bank of Dnieper and beyond.

In the end of 1945, GZI was made of nine sections and eight lower rank independent sections and detachments, the number of staff surpassed 1,000 officers. In the next year, because of the demobilization of the armed forces, the number of staff has fallen to 992. At the same time there was an all-out rebuilding and transformation of staff. At the end of August 1944, the main officer staff was Russian, they came from the Soviet secret services like the NKGB, the NKVD and the military branch of counter-intelligence called SMERSH. In December 1945, the number of Poles in GZI did not surpass 43%, but year later (1946–1947) has grown up to 77%. In first months of GZI activities the Warsaw headquarters staff was entirely Russian. The first Pole came to headquarters at the end of 1945, but by September 1947, almost all important positions were occupied by Polish army officers. In June 1950 headquarters again had been placed under the management of a Russian officer when Dmitrij Wozniesieński (a former SMERSH officer) become the head of GZI. With him came 150 new Russian officers who took over all executive posts. == GZI in numbers and Secret agents == Increasing repression on Army, Navy and Air Force officers, and the very fast development of the new Polish People's Army, forced GZI to increase the manpower and the number of new posts. Whilst in January 1951, the number of permanent employees in GZI was 2,740 (1,002 officers, 302 non-commissioned officers, 1,198 privates and 238 civil employees) by January 1953 the number of permanent employees was up to 4,130 people - (1,502 officers, 453 non-commissioned officers, 1,795 privates and 380 civilian employees). New informers and secret agents were recruited from regular army, navy and air force units. The biggest number of informers and secret agents was in 1952, when for a total of 356,481 Polish army soldiers there were 24,025 informers and secret agents, working inside military structure. At that time, every seventh soldier in the Polish military was in contact with a GZI officer. It was the approved norm that at least one agent from the GZI should be in each platoon. == Repressions == From 1944 to 1957 GZI WP played a role in cleansing the army of officers and soldiers from the pre-war Polish army who were admitted into the new, Polish People's Army, and was responsible for repressions and executions on Home Army soldiers. ===Main cases=== *Tatar-Utnik-Nowicki *Trial of the Generals *The Commandors case (Stanisław Mieszkowski, Zbigniew Przybyszewski, Jerzy Staniewicz - death) == Changes and Reform == In September 1955 Główny Zarząd Informacji Ministerstwa Obrony Narodowej (GZI MON - that name applied from 1950), became part of the Committee for Public Security (Komitet do spraw Bezpieczeństwa Publicznego what means KGB in Russian), which was the well known successor to Ministerstwo Bezpieczeństwa Publicznego more usually known as Urząd Bezpieczeństwa or UB, responsible for political police, counter-intelligence, intelligence and government, protection, and now becoming the Main Directorate of Information of Committee for Public Security or GZI KdsBP. In November 1956 GZI KdsBP separated from Committee for Public Security, and returned to its previous role, becoming again the Main Directorate of Information of Ministry of National Defense. After the reform instituted by Władysław Gomułka in 1956, and the role GZI played in repressions and executions, one year later in 1957 the Main Directorate of Information of Ministry of National Defense was dismantled and replaced by Military Internal Service (Wojskowa Służba Wewnętrzna - or. WSW). == 1990/1991 Changes in military == In 1990 WSW was join with military intelligence (Zarząd II Sztabu Generalnego Wojska Polskiego - \\"2nd Directorate of General Staff of the Polish Army\\"), so that Intelligence and Counter-intelligence were working under one structure which was Zarząd II Wywiadu i Kontrwywiadu - \\"2nd Directorate for Intelligence and Counter- intelligence\\". The organization structure was accepted by minister of national defence General Flolrian Siwicki , but at the same Polish military and political establishment wasn't happy about the huge size of 2nd Directorate. Decision was made to separate the law enforcement part responsible for law and order in military and create new organization called Zandarmeria Wojskowa. Rest of the post communist services KI, and military intelligence was transformed in to Military information services - Wojskowe Służby Informacyjne (or. WSI). == Chiefs of the GZI WP/MON/KdsBP == *1944 - 1945 -- Col. Piotr Kożuszko. *1945 - 1947 -- Col. Jan Rutkowski. *1947 - 1950 -- Col. Stefan Kuhl. *1950 - 1953 -- Col.

In the 1970s, Zhanna started to perform Russian folk songs and romances. At that time she was deeply influenced by Bulat Okudzhava, and she quickly gained popularity in Russia and abroad with some critics dubbing her the Russian Joan Baez. Her unique style of music is often described as Russian country-folk. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Zhanna Bichevskaya's songs began to have more political, nationalist and spiritual themes. She performed a series of White Guard officer's songs, as well as a series of patriotic, monarchist and religious songs, some times songs dedicated to the Romanov Holy Martyrs.

He played a significant role in the coup in 1978 that killed the Afghan president Mohammad Daud Khan and started the \\"Saur Revolution\\". Watanjar later became a member of the politburo in the Soviet- backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, playing prominent roles in the communist coup as well as the coup that overthrew the constitutional monarchy. ==Early life== An Andar Ghilzai Pashtun from Zurmula in Paktia, Watanjar trained as a tank officer in the Soviet Union following his graduation from the Military Academy in Kabul in 1967. ==The Saur Revolution== Watanjar's role in the communist coup of 1978 was important. Instructed by Hafizullah Amin, he initiated the march of tank forces from the motorized forces of numbers 4 and 15 near Pul-e-Charkhi against the government. Colonel Aslam Watanjar was the Army commander on the ground during the Coup, and his troops gained control of Kabul. Colonel Abdul Qadir, the leader of the Air Force squadrons, also launched a major attack on the Royal Palace, in the course of which Mohammed Daoud Khan was killed. Watanjar was present when corpses of the president and his family were buried in a pit. Colonel Watanjar was also in charge of the announcement over Radio Kabul, in the Pashtu language, that a Revolutionary Council of the Armed Forces had been established, with Colonel Abdul Qadir at its head. The council's initial statement of principles, issued late in the evening of April 27, was a noncommittal affirmation of Islamic, democratic, and non-aligned ideals. He was in charge of the operation until Amin took over from him in the evening. On April 30 the RC issued the first of a series of fateful decrees. The decree formally abolished the military's revolutionary council. ==Part of the Khalqi Government== Following the coup, Watanjar was appointed deputy prime minister and minister of communications. Later he served successively as minister of the interior, of defense, and again of the interior until he joined others in a plot against Amin. The Herat uprising also set off a new round in the Afghan regime's internal power struggle. To assuage charges of weak performance in the military leadership, Taraki finally granted Watanjar the position of Minister of Defense. Watanjar's move to take over the Defense Ministry was a demonstrable exploitation of Amin's vulnerability in the aftermath of the failings of the army. However, by July 1979, Amin took over the defense portfolio, replacing him on the grounds that he was a Taraki-sympathizer. Aslam Watanjar joined forces with Sarwari, Gulabzoy and others Khalqis in a plot against then Prime Minister Hafizullah Amin. Except for Sarwari, who was from the province of Ghazni, the others were from Paktia. They had influence with the army, which was officered by a considerable number of persons from Paktia. Until their break with Amin, Sarwari was head of the Intelligence Department (AGSA), while the others were cabinet ministers. At first close friends of Amin, they later turned against him, siding with President Nur Mohammad Taraki in opposition to Amin. When Amin overcame them, they took refuge in the Soviet embassy along with Sarwari and Gulabzoy. ==Part of the Parchami Government== The presence in Soviet Red Army of Sarwari, Watanjar, and Gulabzoy might have influenced the officers not to respond the invasion. Along with them, he served as a guide for the Soviets. After the invasion he was promoted to membership in the central committee and the Revolutionary Council and was appointed Minister of Communications. In June 1981 he was added to the Politburo. Later he served successively as Minister of the Interior, of Defense, and again of the Interior. He also headed the official Afghan delegation to Baikonur, in his position of communications minister and member of its ruling Politburo. On March 6, 1990, General Watanjar intercepted a tank battalion of Shahnawaz Tanai during Tanai's coup attempt, which eventually failed. Watanjar was awarded a four-star rank by President Najibullah and he also became Secretary of Defense.https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/10/world/kabul-journal-in-power- still-afghan-can-thank-his-4-star-aide.html After the fall of Kabul and the collapse of President Najibullah's government, he left the country. ==Death== He died on 24 November 2000 of cancer while in exile, in the Ukrainian city of Odessa.

He was succeeded by his nephew, Diego Ronquillo. ==Governorship== His first official action was to order Manila to become Philippines's political and economic capital in 1582. That same year, he established the Palacio del Gobernador (Governor's Palace) in Intramuros, Manila to integrate all governmental activities in the Philippines. On March 30, 1582, he issued a decree stating that no person may leave the country without his permission. Ronquillo de Peñalosa, according to the content of his order, was informed that some Franciscan priests headed by Fray Pedro de Alfaro left the country in 1579 heading for mainland China. Around March 1582, as he continues, Franciscan Fray Pablo de Jesus and other missionaries re- entered China where they disseminate scandalous talks about the colony. In June 1582, the first bishop of Manila Domingo de Salazar arrived at the Philippines. That same month, Jesuit missionaries successfully entered the Islands. Ronquillo de Peñalosa also reported that they successfully conquered and annexed the last of Moluccan Islands—the Tidore. He also reported to the King that the other island, Ternate was threatened by conquests and invasions from the British through Sir Francis Drake. In his dated letter of June 16, 1582, Ronquillo de Peñalosa suggested to the King of Spain of further fortifications of Spanish footholds in the country. He also said that the Spaniards must dominate the Portuguese in Moluccas, and planned for possible seizing of Macau from Portugal. In a reply letter from the King, Philip II instructed the governor on how to initiate the repartimiento (forced labor) among Indios. In 1582, the Spaniards won and defended Cagayan from Sino- Japanese pirates from possible terrorism and invasion. ==Post-governorship and death== Former governor-general Francisco de Sande's chief enemy and Manila's attorney-general Captain Gabriel de Rivera filed a complaint against Ronquillo de Peñalosa for being the captain-general of the Philippines for life. In 1583, upon processing of Rivera's complaint, Ronquillo de Peñalosa died at his house in Manila. He was succeeded by his own nephew, Diego Ronquillo in office. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:1583 deaths Category:Captains General of the Philippines ","title":"Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñalosa"},{"id":"3241383","text":"The Washington Supreme Court justices are elected at large by the voters of the state of Washington.

In 1584, three judges arrived from Mexico and started the justice court with De Vera serving as the chief justice. After the sudden death of Governor Peñalosa, Diego Ronquillo, his nephew became the governor ad interim but was later charged for defalcation in the trust of Peñalosa's estate and was sent back to Spain as a prisoner.

It was found that stone could be easily cut near the banks of the Pasig in Guadalupe (now Guadalupe Viejo in Makati) and brought to Manila in boats. ==Fort of Nuestra Señora de Guia== He also built the first stone fort of Manila called Nuestra Señora de Guia (Our Lady of Guidance) in 1587 located at the present location of San Diego Bastion (Baluarte de San Diego) at the southwestern corner of Intramuros with plans by a Jesuit named Sedeño. The artillery for this fort was cast by Panday Pira. De Vera also began to dig the moat which surrounded the city. He also built a stone breastwork along the Pasig riverfront.

She was the mother of the famous Lennox sisters. == Early life == She was born Sarah Cadogan in The Hague, the eldest daughter of William Cadogan (from 1716 1st Baron Cadogan of Reading and from 1722 1st Earl Cadogan) and his wife, Margaretta Cecilia Munter.Ladies of Quality and Distinction exhibition programme, edited by K. Palmer, The Founding Museum, London, 2018. She was brought up in a convent and at the age of fourteen was married, on 4 December 1719, to Charles Lennox, Earl of March, at The Hague. The marriage was arranged by both fathers in order to cancel a gambling debt incurred by Lord Cadogan; after the marriage the Earl of March, aged eighteen, embarked on his Grand Tour. On his return in 1722, the earl was reluctant to meet Sarah; he went to the theatre, glimpsed a young woman and asked who she was. 'You must be a stranger in London not to know the toast of the town, the beautiful Lady March', was the reply. In 1723, Charles succeeded to his father's title of Duke of Richmond, whereupon Sarah became Duchess of Richmond. They had a well- publicized happy and companionable marriage. == Courtier and philanthropist == Sarah was appointed a Lady of the Bedchamber to Caroline of Ansbach when Princess of Wales, and remained in post when Caroline became queen consort in 1727. She received a salary of £500 per year but, despite the fact that the post represented the highest possible position at court, she would have carried out mundane duties, including ordering meals and clothes, and dispatching servants to run errands. Sarah was one of the twenty-one 'ladies of quality and distinction' who signed Thomas Coram's first petition, presented to George II in 1735, calling for the foundation of the Founding Hospital. She signed the petition on 22 December 1729 and was the first Lady of the Bedchamber to the Queen recruited by Coram. Her husband signed the Royal Charter in 1739. == Collecting == In the 1730s and 1740s Sarah and her daughters were enthusiastic collectors of shells brought by naval captains returning to Portsmouth. They arranged the shells into elaborate patterns that were incorporated into a grotto in the park of the family's home in Sussex, Goodwood House. == Family == Sarah had twenty-three pregnancies, from which twelve children survived: * Lady Georgiana Carolina Lennox (27 March 1723 – 24 July 1774), married Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland. * Charles Lennox, Earl of March (3 September 1724 – 1724). * Lady Louisa Margaret Lennox (15 November 1725 – May 1728). * Lady Anne Lennox (27 May 1726 – 1727). * Charles Lennox, Earl of March (9 September 1730 – November 1730). * Lady Emilia Mary Lennox (6 October 1731 – 27 March 1814), married first James FitzGerald, 1st Duke of Leinster; and secondly William Ogilvie and had issue. * Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond (22 February 1735 – 29 December 1806). * Lord George Lennox (29 November 1737 – 25 March 1805), General. * Lady Margaret Lennox (16 November 1739 – 10 January 1741). * Lady Louisa Augusta Lennox (24 November 1743 – 1821), married Thomas Connolly but had no issue. * Lady Sarah Lennox (14 February 1745 – August 1826), married first Sir Charles Bunbury, 6th Baronet, and had a daughter (although not with her husband, but with Lord William Gordon); and secondly George Napier. * Lady Cecilia Lennox (28 February 1750 – 21 November 1769), unmarried. ==Popular culture== In 1999, a six-part BBC miniseries based on the lives of her daughters aired in the U.K. It was called Aristocrats and the Duchess was played by Diane Fletcher. ==References== Category:1706 births Category:1751 deaths Category:English duchesses by marriage Category:Daughters of British earls S Category:Ladies of the Bedchamber ","title":"Sarah Lennox, Duchess of Richmond"},{"id":"3241441","text":"Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas y Ribadeneira (1 January 1519 - 25 October 1593Some sources say October 19 or October 23) was a Spanish politician, diplomat, military officer and colonial official. He was the seventh governor-general of the Philippines from May or June 1, 1590 to October 25, 1593. The city of Dasmariñas, located 24 km south of Manila, was named after him. Dasmariñas was a member of the Order of Santiago. ==Background== Pérez Dasmariñas was born in Viveiro,Donapetry Iribarnegaray, Juan (2003). Historia de Vivero y su Concejo. pp. 503. ISBN B84-86824-00-1. Galicia, Spain. He was named governor of León on January 30, 1579. There he built the meat market and various fountains and streets. His work there was viewed favorably, and he was promoted to corregidor of Murcia, Lorca and Cartagena, Spain on September 27, 1584. He held these positions until January 1, 1587. In 1589 he was named governor and captain general of the Philippines by King Philip II. At the same time, Philip increased the salary of the position to 10,000 Castilian ducados per year and made Pérez Dasmariñas a knight of the Order of Santiago. His orders included the suppression of the Audiencia of Manila, something that had been requested by the Spanish settlers in the Philippines. He also had instructions to establish a garrison of 400 soldiers, paid at His Majesty's expense, for the defense of the colony. Pérez Dasmariñas sailed for New Spain (Mexico) on December 8, 1589, on the same ships as Luis de Velasco (hijo), the newly appointed viceroy of New Spain. Continuing his journey, Pérez Dasmariñas left from Acapulco on March 1, 1590 and arrived in Manila in May, or, according to his own account, on June 1. ==As governor== Upon taking office, he quickly suppressed the Audiencia and established the garrison. He worked diligently to build a stone defensive wall around the city of Manila, so diligently that this project was nearly completed by the time of the governor's death in 1593. He rebuilt Fort Santiago. He also had the cathedral of Manila constructed in stone, and encouraged private citizens to build their dwellings in stone.Morga, Antonio de, Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, chapter 5. During his term of office he increased trade with China and improved communication with Spain. He built some galleys for the defense of the coast and suppressed an uprising in Zambales. He sent his son Luis Pérez Dasmariñas at the head of a military expedition to Cagayan, across parts of the island of Luzon never before seen by Spaniards. He also built an artillery foundry in Manila, but because of a lack of skilled founders, this project was not very successful. In the first year of his administration, he sent the president and the oidores (judges) of the suppressed Audiencia to Spain. However Licenciado Pedro de Rojas, the senior oidor, remained in Manila by order of the king as lieutenant-assessor in matters of justice, until some years later he was appointed alcalde in Mexico City. Also during his administration (1592), a letter was received from Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the ruler of Japan at that time, demanding submission and tribute and threatening to come with a fleet and troops to lay waste the country. The correspondence dragged out for several years, until finally Hideyoshi died. As a continuing confirmation of Pre- hispanic Lucoes' service as mercenaries in Southeast Asia, in 1593 the king of Cambodia sent an embassy to the governor, namely the Portuguese Diego Belloso. Belloso brought a present of two elephants and offers of friendship and trade. He also implored aid against Siam, which was threatening the kingdom. Pérez Dasmariñas sent the king a present of a horse and some emeralds and other objects, but postponed a reply to the request for aid. This was the origin of the later Spanish involvement and expeditions to the kingdoms of Siam and Cambodia. On May 12, 1591, Esteban Rodríguez de Figueroa, a wealthy Spaniard of Manila, made an agreement with the governor to conquer Muslim Mindanao. This was to be done at Rodríguez's own expense, in exchange for which he would name the governor of the conquered territory for two lifetimes. Pérez Dasmariñas quarreled with Bishop Salazar, who departed for Spain in 1592. ==Expedition to the Moluccas== In 1593, Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas organized an expedition from Manila to capture the fort at Terrenate, in the Moluccas. (Two previous Spanish expeditions, in 1582 and 1584, had failed.) Pérez Dasmariñas had planned this expedition for some time, but in secret, and did not reveal his intention until most of the preparations had been made. He intended to lead the expedition personally. Before he set sail, he sent his son, Luis Pérez Dasmariñas, on ahead with part of the fleet to the province of Pintado. The governor left the military affairs of Manila and the rest of the Philippines in charge of Diego Ronquillo, and the civil affairs in charge of Pedro de Rojas. After his son left, he remained briefly in Manila, making final preparations and arming a galley (La Capitana) of 28 benches, in which he was to sail. This galley he manned with good Chinese rowers, with pay. According to Antonio de Morga, in order to win the good will of the rowers, he would not allow them to be chained, and even winked at their carrying certain weapons.Morga, Antonio de, Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, chapter 5. About forty Spaniards embarked on the galley, and the galley itself was accompanied by a few frigates and smaller vessels, in which private individuals also embarked. The entire fleet consisted of 200 sails, counting galleys, galliots, frigates, vireys and other craft. More than 900 Spaniards were on the expedition. The governor set sail from Cavite for Pintados in October 1593, to join the part of the fleet under Luis Pérez already at Pintados. They were then to proceed to the Moluccas. ==Mutiny and death of the governor== On the second day of this first leg of the expedition, the governor's fleet reached the island of Caca, 24 leagues from Manila and just off the coast of Luzon. They found it difficult to round the headland known as Punta del Azufre because of a strong head wind. The governor ordered the ships to anchor there for the night, and attempt to round the point the next day. The Chinese rowers had been plotting for three days to seize the galley, and this night gave them an opportunity. In the last watch before dawn, they attacked the guards and the sleeping Spaniards, killing most of them, although a few escaped by swimming or in the galley's tender. Upon hearing the commotion, Governor Dasmariñas, thinking that the galley was dragging and the men were taking to the oars, carelessly left his cabin bareheaded. He was killed by several Chinese waiting outside the door. Two Spaniards, Juan de Cuellar, the governor's secretary, and Franciscan Father Montilla, survived by remaining in their cabin amidships. They were later released ashore by the rebels. The rebels then made for China in the captured galley, but were unable to arrive there. Instead they reached Cochin China, where the king confiscated the two cannons aboard and all the items of value (jewels, money, etc.). The rebels were dispersed to different places and the galley was abandoned. A few of the rebels were later captured in Malacca and sent back to Manila, where \\"justice was dealt them.\\" ==The choice of a new governor== The colony was now without a governor. Pérez Dasmariñas had brought with him to the Philippines a royal order directing him to choose a temporary successor in the event of his own death. He had shown this order to various prominent Spaniards in the colony, implying to each that he was the designated successor. In particular, both the governor's son and conquistador Captain Estevan Rodríguez de Figueroa expected the appointment. Both were on the expedition to the Moluccas, and both hurried back to Manila to take command of the colony. Meanwhile, the citizens and soldiers in Manila elected Licenciado Pedro de Rojas governor and captain general. But with the return of Luis Pérez Dasmariñas, the previous governor's instructions were found, and his son became the new governor. ==See also== * 1593 transported soldier legend ==Notes== ==External links== *History of the Philippine Islands by Dr. Antonio de Morga (1907).

The capital of the county is Siah Cheshmeh () or Qara Aineh is also called Chaldoran. The other prominent town in the district is Avajiq. At the 2006 census, the county's population was 44,572, in 9,006 families. The county is subdivided into two districts: the Central District and Dashtaki District. The county has two cities: Siah Cheshmeh and Avajiq. The population of Chaldoran are Azeri and Kurmancî Kurds. Chaldoran is one of the tourist areas of West Azerbaijan Province of Iran because of its cold weather in winter and cool in summer. ==History== Chaldoran is the site of the historic Battle of Chaldiran, which took place in 1514 between the armies of Ottoman Sultan Selim I and Safavid Shah Ismail I on the narrow plain outside of the town. The Ottoman army had the advantage of using firearms as well as superiority in size, and defeated the Safavid army for the first time. After the Ottomans took this area, they resettled many of the Kurdish tribes further west. Holy Tatavous Church (Ghare Kelisa) or St. Thaddeus's is in Chaldoran district, 7 km north east of the town of Seyah Cheshmah. A panorama of the site of Saint Thaddeus Monastery ==Economy== The expansion of pastures and cultivable lands has given this region the opportunity of enjoying prosperous cattle breeding, agriculture and apiculture with highest rate of job creation in the region. According to the census of the year 2003, population of Chaldoran district is 46,700; 33.5 percent of whom live in urban areas and 66.5 percent are rural and tribal settlers.

The route formerly extended east to Interstate 10 (I-10) near Joshua Tree National Park as a longer route extending to Blythe and points further east. After the main route was shifted north, the older route remained as an alternate known as Box Canyon Road. The route was designated in the 1964 state highway renumbering, although the Box Canyon Road portion was removed as a state highway in 1972. Following the construction of the SR 86 expressway, SR 195 was curtailed in 2009, and removed entirely in 2014. ==Route description== Before the route was mostly removed in 2009, it began at Harrison Street, the old routing of SR 86, in Riverside County. It then headed north as Pierce Street until intersecting 66th Street, where SR 195 turned east. The highway intersected SR 86 and continued to the town of Mecca, where it met its north end at SR 111. The route loosely paralleled the northern end of the Salton Sea, passing through farmland for its entire length. In 2013, SR 195 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 4,500 vehicles at Buchanan Street, and 6,000 vehicles at the eastern terminus with SR 111, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway. ==History== Route 64, a highway from Mecca to Blythe, was added to the state highway system in 1919. In 1935, Pierce Street from Route 26 near Oasis to Avenue 66, and Avenue 66 from Route 26 to Mecca were added to the state highway system. Two years later, Pierce Street was designated as Route 203, and Avenue 66 was designated as Route 204. By 1926, the road existed east of Mecca to Blythe, but was unpaved; by 1930, the road connected from Mecca to the road along the western side of the Salton Sea to Indio and points further west. Between 1932 and 1934, the road east of Mecca had been paved. The western part of the road, known as the Box Canyon road, from Mecca to Blythe served as part of US 60 and US 70 until it was eventually bypassed in favor of a more direct route to Indio, diverging at Shavers' Summit. Between 1934 and 1936, US 60 and US 70 had made the shift north towards Indio, and the portion between US 99 and Mecca was paved. Initial opposition was later overcome after the road was washed out during a storm and forced motorists to take refuge in the nearby foothills. By 1940, the SR 195 designation was signed. In the 1940s, the highway continued due west of Mecca to end at an intersection with US 99, rather than turning south. In 1953, efforts to remove the road from Mecca to the highway from Blythe to Indio, from the state highway system were met with community opposition, since it served as an alternate route for the other highway. State Senator Nelson S. Dilworth proposed legislation to require the road from Banning through Idyllwild to Mountain Center to be added to the state highway system if SR 195 was removed, as the two were of roughly the same length, but the latter remained in the system. SR 195 was officially designated in the 1964 state highway renumbering. The original alignment continued past SR 111 and the Salton Sea before ending at US 60, which later became I-10, at the southern end of Joshua Tree National Park. The Division of Highways proposed deleting this part of the state highway in 1971, though similar plans had been revived in 1969. This portion was removed in 1972. In 1988, the California Transportation Commission (CTC) approved shifting SR 111 onto the new SR 86 expressway after it was completed, using SR 195 to make the connection. When the SR 86 expressway was fully constructed, SR 195 was to be removed from the state highway system according to state law; that expressway was finished in 2001. However, this removed the connection from the highway portion of SR 111 to the new expressway carrying both SR 111 and SR 86 north from the state highway system. Caltrans officially deleted most of SR 195 in 2009, leaving a gap in SR 111 following deletions of the old routing that was now bypassed by the expressway. In December 2014, with Riverside County and Caltrans both supporting, the CTC transferred the remaining portion of SR 195, from the new SR 86 expressway to SR 111, to become part of SR 111. SR 195 still appears in Caltrans documents dated from 2014. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== *California @ AARoads.com - State Route 195 *Caltrans: Route 195 highway conditions *California Highways: SR 195 195 Category:Coachella Valley State Route 195 Category:U.S. Route 60 Category:U.S. Route 70 ","title":"California State Route 195"},{"id":"3241496","text":"The red-headed titi (Cheracebus regulus) is a species of titi, a type of New World monkey, endemic to Brazil.

Three of the four recognised subspecies are found only in Western Australia, where they are known collectively by the common name bobtail. The name shingleback is also used, especially for T. rugosa asper, the only subspecies native to eastern Australia. Apart from bobtail and shingleback, a variety of other common names are used in different states, including stumpy-tailed skink, bogeye or boggi, pinecone lizard and sleepy lizard. Aboriginal names include Yoorn in the Nyungar language. Tiliqua rugosa has a heavily armoured body and can be found in various colours, ranging from dark brown to cream. It has a short, wide, stumpy tail that resembles its head and may confuse predators. The tail also contains fat reserves, which are drawn upon during brumation in winter. This skink is an omnivore; it eats snails and plants and spends much of its time browsing through vegetation for food. It is often seen sunning on roadsides or other paved areas. ==Etymology and taxonomy== The species was first described by John Edward Gray in 1825 as Trachydosaurus rugosus. It is now classified as Tiliqua rugosa. Some herpetologists claim this species has more common names than any other lizard. ==Subspecies== Four subspecies of T. rugosa are currently recognised: *T. r. rugosa: bobtail or western shingleback - Western Australia *T. r. asper: eastern shingleback - eastern Australia *T. r. konowi: Rottnest Island bobtail or Rottnest Island shingleback - Rottnest Island, Western Australia *T. r. palarra: northern bobtail or Shark Bay shingleback - Shark Bay, Western Australia ==Distribution and habitat== The species is widely distributed in arid to semiarid regions of southern and western Australia. The range extends from Shark Bay, Western Australia, across the southernmost regions of the country to the coast, then north into Queensland. Four subspecies are found in Western Australia, including one at Rottnest Island. It also occurs in the eastern states of Victoria and New South Wales, but does not reach coastal areas. The habitat of the species includes shrublands and desert grasslands to sandy dunes. These skinks are well known, due to a preference for sun basking in open areas, and are often seen along roadsides or other cleared areas in its range. On average, individuals have a home range of four hectares, and can move up to 500 metres per day.Sleepy lizards' monogamous lives tracked by researchers ABC News, 26 December 2015.

Shingleback lizard It has a triangular head and a bright blue tongue. Its short, stumpy tail is similar in shape to its head. This possibly evolved as a defence mechanism against predators, and has led to the common name of \\"two- headed skink\\". Its short tail also contains fat reserves, which the lizard lives upon during brumation in winter. Unlike many skinks, shinglebacks do not exhibit autotomy and cannot shed their tails. Individuals are known to live for 50 years in the wild.Life, death and a sleepy lizard: One researcher's remarkable work on a monogamous blue-tongue ABC News, 16 April 2017. Retrieved 16 April 2017. ==Diet== Front view Tiliqua rugosa is an omnivore that eat snails, insects, carrion, vegetation and flowers. The species was once preyed upon by dingos, Australian pythons such as Morelia spilota, and local peoples; a threat is now more likely to come from large, introduced feral species, such as foxes and cats. They have also been known to eat human food, such as sausage and chicken, as well as fruits such as banana and passionfruit. ==In captivity== The shingleback skink has become a popular pet among Australian enthusiasts. They are relatively docile and easy to feed and maintain. A permit may be required to keep them in some areas. ==Reproduction== Captive specimens T. rugosa is a viviparous skink, giving birth to broods of one to four relatively large offspring. Unlike most lizards, the species tends to be monogamous extending outside the breeding season of September through November; such pairs have been known to return to each other every year for up to 20 years. When they are born, the young immediately consume their afterbirth. They stay with their parents for several months before moving on, but they remain in close proximity, forming a colony of closely related skinks. The male of a monogamous pair eats less while parenting, remaining alert and ready to give an alarm. ==Hearing== Their hearing can be measured at the round window as cochlear microphonics and summating potential (of the cochlea), and compound action potential and single-fibre responses (of the auditory nerve). These indicate a best hearing range near 1000 Hz. Earlier reports that their hearing sensitivity varied with the season have been shown to be an artefact of the seasonally varying sensitivity to anesthetics. Single-unit recordings from the auditory nerve show both spontaneous and nonspontaneous responses. Tuning curves show peak sensitivity between 200 Hz and 4.5 kHz. The absolute sensitivity is quite high, with some thresholds at 6 db sound pressure level, very close to human best sensitivity. ==References== ==Further reading == * Category:Reptiles of Western Australia Category:Pets in Australia Category:Reptiles described in 1825 Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray Category:Skinks of Australia Category:Tiliqua ","title":"Tiliqua rugosa"},{"id":"3241508","text":"The Rio Purus titi (Cheracebus purinus) is a species of titi, a type of New World monkey, endemic to Brazil. ==References== Rio Purus titi Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Rio Purus titi ","title":"Rio Purus titi"},{"id":"3241519","text":"The Atlantic titi or masked titi (Callicebus personatus) is a species of titi, a type of New World monkey, endemic to Brazil. ==Distribution and general features== The Atlantic titi is part of the genus Callicebus which is composed of thirteen species and sixteen subspecies. Some more recent classifications of titis recognise many more species, and split the genus into three separate genera. The C. personatus group is retained in Callicebus. Three subspecies of Callicebus personatus have been described in scientific literature: C.p. melanochir, C.p. nigrifrons, and C.p. personatus, each of which has been treated as a full species by some authors. Atlantic titis are territorial, middle-sized, cebid monkeys; usually 1–2 kg in size. C. personatus are found primarily in the humid forests east of the Andes Mountains, specifically in the coastal, inland forests of south-eastern Brazil. The states they have been documented to dwell within include Bahia, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. Of all the Callicebus species, Atlantic titi monkeys have the largest geographic range except for C. torquatus, covering approximately 1,000 kilometers. They customarily share their living area with other monkeys such as the lion tamarin and spider monkey. ===Subspecies variations=== The three subspecies of Callicebus personatus are products of clinical differentiation (when certain portions of the population are cut off from the parental stock due to an ecological barrier such as a river and are thus completely genetically isolated from one another). Distinctions between each of the Callicebus subspecies are based on coat color. The evolution of these coat colors is termed metachromism. The pigments are produced by melanocytes which deposit the pigments into the medulla of growing hair so that the hair grows with the color of that distinct pigment. The characteristic pigment of the Callicebus is eumelanin (dark brown or black) found in the iris, skin, and hair (usually on the forehead, crown and tail). ==Diet== Atlantic titis are opportunistic feeders. In other words, they eat based on the abundance of food that is available to them in each season. Their food choices are not usually very selective, but they are frugivorous, usually eating fleshy fruits, seeds, and leaves. ===Geophagy=== It has been documented that they can be geophagic meaning that at times they eat soil. Various hypotheses exist for their geophagic nature. These include the following: *Dietary mineral supplementation *Adjustment of pH balance in the stomach *Absorption of plant toxins *Tactile sensation in the mouth *Physiochemical effects on the gastrointestinal tract *Relief from infestation of internal parasites Masked titis are tree monkeys. It is not customary to find them on the forest floor. It is speculated that they prefer to remain in the rainforest trees to avoid snake predation. They remain at least 5 meters above the ground for 99% of their daily activities. Due to their frugivorous nature, they have rarely been observed on the ground foraging for insects or small vertebrates. Instead they prefer to remain high in the tree limbs of the dense eastern Brazilian rainforest. Because they prefer not to be on the ground, researchers have observed them eating soil found atop ant mounds. This is an added advantage to the masked titis for the following reasons: *It is a safer location to choose soil because it allows the monkeys to scan for surrounding predators and gives them close access to the protection of the trees *Aggregate soil is easier for them to grasp with their opposable fingers than forest floor topsoil (which is not as held together as soil that has been cemented together by leaf-cutting ants) *There is less leaf litter and forest debris on ant mounds, thus decreasing the amount of time they are exposed to predators Atlanti titi is a species of Espírito Santo Atlantic Forest. For many years, researchers believed that geophagy might be have been used by the masked titi's as a sodium supplement as their high foliage diets were quite low in sodium. However, results of geochemical analysis of the soils eaten by C. personatus demonstrated that these soils did not contain high quantities of sodium. Although the soil consumed by masked titis was found to contain many different minerals in comparison to random soil samples, these minerals where not necessarily a valuable component of the titi diet. Therefore, it was concluded that soil was not a nutritionally significant portion of their diet. Another hypothesis suggested that the soil served as an antacid. However, results of the most recent studies demonstrated that the soil consumed by the monkeys contained a very low pH compared to random soil samples. Therefore, it seems geophagy is not principally used to buffer the stomach pH levels. In addition, because the clay molecule has a large flat structure that is ideal for toxin absorption, researchers also suggested that soil could serve to absorb the toxins acquired by the consumption of such a high quantity and variety of forest foliage. Unfortunately, more research needs to be conducted on this hypothesis to test its validity as currently no studies have been conducted on the toxicity levels in the fruit eaten by the masked titis. It is also important to note that termite mound soil was preferred by the titis in addition to the ant soil. Both the ant mound soil as well as the termite mound soil perform the same function for the monkeys, however some researchers have observed that the monkeys usually tend to prefer termite mound soil to ant mound soil when given both options. The reason for such a preference is not yet known. ==Survival== Regardless of the presence of humans in Brazilian forests, titi monkeys customarily venture to dwell in \\"disturbed\\" forests (forests that have been cut down or invaded by humans) as long as the food availability is higher than in undisturbed forests. The use of disturbed and undisturbed forest by masked titi monkeys Callicebus personatus melanochir is proportional to food availability. The Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil has been cut down to 5% of its original state with only 2% of that being undisturbed forest. Their existence is completely dependent on their ability to successfully reside in disturbed forests. However, titis do not seem to be aware of the difference between a disturbed and undisturbed forest. As previously mentioned, they feed opportunistically and therefore will reside in whatever forest has the most food available. As long as food is available to them (even if humans provide this food), it is feasible that the monkeys survive the deforestation of much of the Southern American rain forests. ==Reproduction== Atlantic titis are usually monogamous (they stay with one mate throughout their entire lifespan). They have one offspring per year. It is difficult to distinguish between the sexes externally, however Atlantic titi family dynamics indicate that the father carries the infant at all times during the nursing. ==Level of daily activity== Two major types of activity have been observed in masked titis. The first is characterized by two feeding periods separated by a relatively long resting period. The two feeding periods are in different locations in which a significant portion of the day was spent traveling to the second location to feed. The second activity pattern contained three feeding periods also separated by resting periods. However, travel was much more evenly dispersed throughout the day in this pattern. Each feeding period lasted approximately 2–3 hours, and traveling usually consumed approximately 20% of their day. Masked titis do have territorial displays throughout the day. The defend their territories by loud intergroup vocalizations to other groups of monkeys and to other animals in the general area. Additionally, all titi monkeys have \\"Dawn Calls\\" in the mornings in which the male and female usually duet the same song. ==References== ==External links== Atlantic titi Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Fauna of the Atlantic Forest (biome) Category:Southeastern South American coastal fauna Category:Vulnerable animals Category:Vulnerable biota of South America Atlantic titi ","title":"Atlantic titi"},{"id":"3241523","text":"Abert's towhee (Melozone aberti) is a bird of the family Passerellidae, native to a small range in southwestern North America, generally the lower Colorado River and Gila River watersheds, nearly endemic to Arizona, but also present in small parts of California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, and Sonora in Mexico. The name of this bird commemorates the American ornithologist James William Abert (1820–1897). ==Description== Abert's towhees are recognized by their relatively long tails, dark faces, and overall brown plumage. They are related to sparrows and juncos but are more similar to thrashers in appearance. They may be confused with the California towhee, but their dark faces are more distinct, and the range of these species only slightly overlaps.

Though threatened by cowbird nest parasitism and habitat loss, it has successfully colonized suburban environments in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area and may be fairly easily seen on the campus of Arizona State University. Despite its limited range, it is classified as a species of Least Concern in the IUCN Redlist, and there has been some range expansion along the Santa Cruz River as well as in Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona. ==Feeding== Abert's towhees usually forage on the ground among dense brush for seeds, but they also incorporate insects into their diet. Like other towhees, they scratch at the ground in a manner similar to quail, and will sometimes dig up and eat grubs. They can be attracted to feeders by providing cracked corn on the ground. ==References== ==Further reading== *Anderson BW, Higgins A & Ohmart RD. (1977).

The battle took place near Penparc, Cardigan, probably on the hill now known as Banc y Warren, and resulted in a rout of the Norman forces, setting back their expansion in West Wales for some years. ==Background== A Welsh revolt against Norman rule had begun in South Wales, where on 1 January 1136 the Welsh won a victory over the local Norman forces at the Battle of Llwchwr between Loughor and Swansea, killing about 500 of their opponents. Richard Fitz Gilbert de Clare, the Norman lord of Ceredigion, had been away from his lordship in the early part of the year. Returning to the borders of Wales in April, he ignored warnings of the danger and pressed on towards Ceredigion with a small force. He had not gone far when he was ambushed and killed by the men of Iorwerth ab Owain, grandson of Caradog ap Gruffydd (the penultimate prince of Gwent). The news of Richard's death led to an invasion by the forces of Gwynedd, led by Owain Gwynedd and Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd, sons of the king of Gwynedd, Gruffudd ap Cynan. They captured a number of castles in northern Ceredigion before returning home to dispose of the plunder. Around Michaelmas (11 October in the Julian Calendar used at the time) they again invaded Ceredigion and made an alliance with Gruffydd ap Rhys of Deheubarth. The combined Welsh forces headed for the town of Cardigan. This army, said to number 6,000, including 2,000 mailed horsemen, had taken up a style of warfare learnt from the Normans. The Normans were said to have a substantial force. ==Location== Northeast face of Banc-y-Warren from the A487 road The exact location of the battlefield is not known. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales puts the site of the battle on the southeast slopes of Banc y Warren (or Banc- y-Warren), a prominent conical hill near Penparc, northeast of Cardigan. There is a farm on the southeast slope named Crugmore. A geophysical survey and archaeological appraisal were carried out at Crugmore Farm in 2014 in support of planning applications. No evidence indicative of a battle was found in the areas covered by the surveys. Some accounts place the site on the northeast of the hill, which may be more likely because the road from Cardigan bends round the northeast side of the hill before turning more northerly again. The southeast side of the hill does not coincide with a road. The hill was known as Crug Mawr at least as early as the 9th century. Gerald of Wales, in his Itinerarium Cambriae of 1191, describes (56 years after the battle): Members of Gerald's family were participants in the battle. ==Battle== Two miles outside Cardigan the Welsh army encountered a Norman force and battle was joined. The Normans were led by Robert fitz Martin, supported by Robert fitz Stephen, constable of Cardigan Castle, with the brothers William and Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan. After some hard fighting, which may have seen one of the earliest incidences of the use of the Welsh longbow as a battlefield weapon, the Norman forces were put to flight and pursued as far as the River Teifi. Many of the fugitives tried to cross the bridge, which broke under the weight. Hundreds are said to have drowned, clogging the river with the bodies of men and horses. Foot soldiers were trampled by horses. Others fled to the town of Cardigan which, however, was taken and burned by the Welsh even though Robert fitz Martin managed to successfully defend the castle. Skulls with battle wounds have been found nearby. The Breviate Chronicle of 1136 gives a contemporary account of the battle, which notes that the leaders included Owain and Cadwaladr (ap Gruffydd), Gruffydd ap Rhys, Rhys ap Hywel, Madog ab Idnerth and the sons of Hywel on the Welsh side, and Stephen the Constable and the sons of Gerald, supported by Flemish forces, on the Norman side, some travelling a considerable distance to the battle. Edward Laws quotes Florence of Worcester (vol iii, p97): Florence had died in 1118, so the account was probably penned by his successor, John of Worcester (who died about 1140). Accounts of the site and leadership therefore vary. There are detailed proposed descriptions of the battle online, supported by a number of (mostly 20th century) publications; these are listed below under \\"Further reading\\". ==Aftermath== The battle was a significant setback to Norman expansion in Wales. Ceredigion, which had been part of Deheubarth before the Normans had conquered it, was now annexed by Gwynedd, the more powerful member of the coalition. Owain Gwynedd became king of Gwynedd on the death of his father the following year and further expanded the borders of his kingdom. In Deheubarth, Gruffydd ap Rhys died in uncertain circumstances in 1137, and the resulting disruption allowed the Normans to partially recover their position in the south. Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth won it back for his kingdom during the war of 1165-1170. ==See also== History of Wales ==References== ==Further reading== *Pritchard, E.M.

It is a colorless solid that is widely used to modify biopolymers, fragment proteins and peptides (cuts the C-terminus of methionine), and synthesize other compounds. The compound is classified as a pseudohalogen. == Synthesis, basic properties, and structure == The carbon atom in cyanogen bromide is bonded to bromine by a single bond and to nitrogen by a triple bond (i.e. Br–C≡N). The compound is linear and polar, but it does not spontaneously ionize in water. It dissolves in both water and polar organic solvents. Cyanogen bromide can be prepared by oxidation of sodium cyanide with bromine, which proceeds in two steps via the intermediate cyanogen ((CN)2): :2 NaCN + Br2 → (CN)2 \\\\+ 2 NaBr :(CN)2 \\\\+ Br2 → 2 (CN)Br When refrigerated the material has an extended shelflife. Like some other cyanogen compounds, cyanogen bromide undergoes an exothermic trimerisation to cyanuric bromide ((BrCN)3). This reaction is catalyzed by traces of bromine, metal salts, acids and bases. For this reason, experimentalists avoid brownish samples. :300px Cyanogen bromide is hydrolyzed to release hydrogen cyanide and hypobromous acid :(CN)Br + H2O → HCN + HOBr == Biochemical applications == The main uses of cyanogen bromide are to immobilize proteins, fragment proteins by cleaving peptide bonds, and synthesize cyanamides and other molecules. Cyanogen bromide activation method === Protein immobilization === Cyanogen bromide is often used to immobilize proteins by coupling them to reagents such as agarose for affinity chromatography. Because of its simplicity and mild pH conditions, cyanogen bromide activation is the most common method for preparing affinity gels. Cyanogen bromide is also often used because it reacts with the hydroxyl groups on agarose to form cyanate esters and imidocarbonates. These groups are reacted with primary amines in order to couple the protein onto the agarose matrix, as shown in the figure. Because cyanate esters are more reactive than are cyclic imidocarbonates, the amine will react mostly with the ester, yielding isourea derivatives, and partially with the less reactive imidocarbonate, yielding substituted imidocarbonates. The disadvantages of this approach include the toxicity of cyanogen bromide and its sensitivity to oxidation. Also, cyanogen bromide activation involves the attachment of a ligand to agarose by an isourea bond, which is positively charged at neutral pH and thus unstable. Consequently, isourea derivatives may act as weak anion exchangers. === Protein cleavage === Cyanogen bromide hydrolyzes peptide bonds at the C-terminus of methionine residues. This reaction is used to reduce the size of polypeptide segments for identification and sequencing. ==== Mechanism ==== Cyanogen bromide peptide bond cleavage The electron density in cyanogen bromide is shifted away from the carbon atom, making it unusually electrophilic, and towards the more electronegative bromine and nitrogen. This leaves the carbon particularly vulnerable to attack by a nucleophile, and the cleavage reaction begins with a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction in which bromine is ultimately replaced by the sulfur in methionine. This attack is followed by the formation of a five-membered ring as opposed to a six- membered ring, which would entail the formation of a double bond in the ring between nitrogen and carbon. This double bond would result in a rigid ring conformation, thereby destabilizing the molecule. Thus, the five-membered ring is formed so that the double bond is outside the ring, as shown in the figure. Although the nucleophilic sulfur in methionine is responsible for attacking BrCN, the sulfur in cysteine does not behave similarly. If the sulfur in cysteine attacked cyanogen bromide, the bromide ion would deprotonate the cyanide adduct, leaving the sulfur uncharged and the beta carbon of the cysteine not electrophilic. The strongest electrophile would then be the cyanide nitrogen, which, if attacked by water, would yield cyanic acid and the original cysteine. ==== Reaction conditions ==== Cleaving proteins with BrCN requires using a buffer such as 0.1M HCl (hydrochloric acid) or 70% (formic acid). These are the most common buffers for cleavage. An advantage to HCl is that formic acid causes the formation of formyl esters, which complicates protein characterization. However, formic is still often used because it dissolves most proteins. Also, the oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide, which is inert to BrCN attack, occurs more readily in HCl than in formic acid, possibly because formic acid is a reducing acid. Alternative buffers for cleavage include guanidine or urea in HCl because of their ability to unfold proteins, thereby making methionine more accessible to BrCN. Note that water is required for normal peptide bond cleavage of the iminolactone intermediate. In formic acid, cleavage of Met-Ser and Met-Thr bonds is enhanced with increased water concentration because these conditions favor the addition of water across the imine rather than reaction of the side chain hydroxyl with the imine. Lowered pH tends to increase cleavage rates by inhibiting methionine side chain oxidation. ==== Side reactions ==== When methionine is followed by serine or threonine, side reactions can occur that destroy the methionine without peptide bond cleavage. Normally, once the iminolactone is formed (refer to figure), water and acid can react with the imine to cleave the peptide bond, forming a homoserine lactone and new C-terminal peptide. However, if the adjacent amino acid to methionine has a hydroxyl or sulfhydryl group, this group can react with the imine to form a homoserine without peptide bond cleavage. These two cases are shown in the figure. == Organic synthesis == Cyanogen bromide is a common reagent in organic synthesis. As stated earlier, the reagent is prone to attack by nucleophiles such as amines and alcohols because of the electrophilic carbon. In the synthesis of cyanamides and dicyanamides, primary and secondary amines react with BrCN to yield mono- and dialkylcyanamides, which can further react with amines and hydroxylamine to yield guanidines and hydroxyguanidines. In the von Braun reaction, tertiary amines react with BrCN to yield disubstituted cyanamides and an alkyl bromide. Cyanogen bromide can be used to prepare aryl nitriles, nitriles, anhydrides, and cyanates. It can also serve as a cleaving agent. Cyanogen bromide is used in the synthesis of 4-methylaminorex (\\"ice \\") and viroxime. == Toxicity, storage, and deactivation == Cyanogen bromide can be stored under dry conditions at 2 to 8 °C for extended periods. Cyanogen bromide is volatile, and readily absorbed through the skin or gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, toxic exposure may occur by inhalation, physical contact, or ingestion. It is acutely toxic, causing a variety of nonspecific symptoms. Exposure to even small amounts may cause convulsions or death. LD50 orally in rats is reported as 25–50 mg/kg. The recommended method to deactivate cyanogen bromide is with bleach. The aqueous alkali hydroxide instantly hydrolyzes (CN)Br to alkali cyanide and bromide. The cyanide can then be oxidized by sodium or calcium hypochlorite to the less toxic cyanate ion. Note that deactivation is extremely exothermic and may be explosive. == References == == Further reading == * * == External links == * * Category:Bromides Category:Cyanides Category:Inorganic nitrogen compounds Category:Nonmetal halides ","title":"Cyanogen bromide"},{"id":"3241548","text":"The White Citizens Parties were autonomous local parties (often county based) in the greater Southern United States, that served as the public face and often directly as what would today be considered Political Action Committees for racist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan. These groups flourished after Reconstruction when the Union withdrew its troops from the South. These parties were pivotal in establishing and maintaining Jim Crow legislation at the local level. They offered coordinated support of the Democratic Party through the one-party South until it began opposing segregation in the later 20th century. Over time, many of the parties were subsumed into the Democratic Party. By the late 20th century, conservative southern whites largely shifted into the Republican Party. The Civil Rights Movement overcame the system that supported the White Citizens Parties, and they have largely disappeared. Some survive under the name Citizens Party (no link with the Citizens Party of Barry Commoner) or Council of Conservative Citizens, and occasionally field serious local candidates with positions to the right of their Republican and Democratic colleagues.

It lives in forests and thickets. It has a rounded head and a thick, soft coat and frequently adopts a characteristic posture with the body hunched, limbs close together, and a tail hanging down. The body is 28–39 cm long, and the tail is 33–49 cm. It can move quite fast if necessary but rarely does so and generally stays within a fairly small area, feeding on fruit, insects, spiders, small birds, and bird's eggs. It is diurnal and moves in pairs or family groups, which communicate by means of a wide repertoire of sounds. The female gives birth to a single offspring. ==Physical description== The red-bellied titi has an average head and body length of for males and for females, showing no sexual dimorphism. Its tail has a greater length than the head and body combined. Males weigh between while females range from . It has a larger pollex than its hallux. It has six palmar pads and nails on each of its five digits. It has a dental formula of i 2/2, p 3/3, m 3/3 with a total of 36. Its upper incisors are elongated and the incisiform canines barely extend beyond the other teeth. The upper molars are sometimes tricuspid and the lower premolars are relatively simple. Upper and lower molars are quadricuspid. It has relatively large ears often obscured by the fur on side of the head. The nose has a wide internal septum and the nares open laterally. In adults, the pelage of the back can be grey, reddish, or brown. It usually has white or black bands on its forehead. This color pattern found both in young and adults. The ear has a helical margin that is pulled upward and towards the back. The anterior superior margins are rolled. Tragus and antitragus are small, lobulated and equal in size. The manus has a unique raided pads; the interdigital pads are separated from the palm by a structure called deep flex urge line. The palm consist of two elongated central pads, a hypothenar pad and a thenar pad. The skull is orthognathous, orbits are unfenestrated, balls are inflated ventrally, and a large sinus found above the nasal. The foramen magnum is located towards the front, and the atlas has shallow anterior articular facets which allow the condyles to attach. Anterior margin of the lacrimal fossa is formed by or near the maxilla. The premaxilla is short, giving the appearance of a small, not especially prognathic face relative to other platyrrhines. The corpus of the mandible deepens posteriorly and the ramus is tall. The hyoid bone is expanded and highly convex ventrally. ==Behavior and ecology== Groups vary in size from two to four individuals usually with an adult female and an adult male. The young tend to leave group at the age of 2–3 years old. It rarely interacts with other primates. Bonding between male and female pairs is extremely strong. Once this relationship is established, partners remain very close to each other. Couples also intertwine the tails whenever possible. Couples tend to follow each other and remain near each other throughout the day. The males play a major role in taking care of the young. Siblings however, do not play a role and do not usually help in rearing of the young. The adults use chest rubbing as a visual signal, dragging branches along their chest slowly. Later, after brushing, the area is smelt or rubbed. It tends to inhabit lower and denser tropical forest especially close to rivers and river banks. It has a frugivorous diet, eating anything from fruits and twigs to leaves and insects. It has a relatively small home range. Like other titis, it is highly territorial and sends out vocal calls to mark territory and scare off other animals. Grooming occurs frequently throughout the day, mostly during rest periods. Both females and males, adults and young participate in grooming. It has been suggested that grooming is a form of habituation introducing the concept of presence and physical contact with companions. Adults and juvenile also intertwine tails with the opposite sex whenever two from the same social group are by each other. The red-bellied titi has a variety of postures and facial expressions that it uses as visual signals. Swaying the entire body, turning the head sideways and lowering the head to face downward are examples of these signals. Observers have seen that these signals are a response to a disturbance or escape tendencies. Arching of the back is a signal that the red-bellied titi uses to warn that they're about to attack. This signal is associated with hostility, after they arch their backs an attack usually follows. Other signals associated with hostility include piloerection and tail lashing. These tend to follow back arching and are often used as scare tactics. Facial expressions observed in these species include partial and complete shutting of the eyes, protrusion of the lips and baring of the teeth which is usually followed by smacking of the lips. Infants are usually transferred and tended to by the males. Females only lick and nurse the infants. The adult males are responsible for carrying the infants except when the young is being nursed or licked. Sometimes the juvenile transfers itself from adult to adult, especially when the two adults are close to each other. There is a close association between males and juvenile after the juvenile becomes self- locomoting. ==References== *Macmillan Illustrated Animal Encyclopedia *American Society of Mammalogists.

The Milwaukee Public Schools system is the one of the largest in the United States by enrollment. A publicly elected school board, the Milwaukee Board of School Directors, provides direction and oversight, with a superintendent heading the organization's administration. Milwaukee Public Schools' offerings include neighborhood schools, specialty schools and charter schools serving students as young as age 3 up through grade 12. == Programs == Specialty programs in MPS include arts schools such as Milwaukee High School of the Arts; career and technical education schools such as Lynde & Harry Bradley Technology and Trade School; gifted and talented schools such as Golda Meir School; International Baccalaureate and college prep high schools such as Rufus King International School - High School Campus, Riverside University High School and Ronald Reagan College Preparatory High School; language immersion schools including French, German, Italian, and Spanish immersion elementary schools and Milwaukee School of Languages for middle- and high-school students; and a large number of Montessori schools. The district owns WYMS-FM (88.9), which airs an eclectic selection of music and is programmed by a local non-profit group via an LMA. == Performance == While overall reading and math proficiency rates are below the state average and below those of some other large city districts, the district did see some growth in scores in both subjects and both grades tested on the 2013 National Assessment of Educational Progress and on the 2012–13 state standardized tests, MPS students, on the whole, outperformed Milwaukee students receiving publicly funded vouchers to attend private schools. School District officials note declining funding as a catalyst to problems in the district. However, local journalists have cited school officials as lacking in motivation to improve the system. The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction in its 2011−12 School District Performance Report lists Milwaukee's Regular Diploma Graduation Rate at 66.2%. In 2012, Rufus King International School – High School Campus was ranked the 130th best public high school in the nation, making it the top performing school in the state of Wisconsin. Ronald Reagan College Preparatory High School was ranked second in Wisconsin, while Milwaukee School of Languages was ranked seventh. == Charter schools == In 1990, Milwaukee became the first community in the United States to adopt a school voucher program. The program enables students to receive public funding to study at parochial and other private schools free of cost. The 2006−07 school year marked the first time that more than $100 million was paid in vouchers, as 26% of Milwaukee students receive public funding to attend schools outside the MPS system. If the voucher program alone were considered a school district, it would mark the sixth-largest district in Wisconsin. Under Wisconsin state law, the Milwaukee school board is one of several entities that can authorize charter schools in the city. Other authorities that can authorize charter schools are the Milwaukee City Council, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and the Milwaukee Area Technical College Board.Layla Merrifield. \\"Charter Schools\\".

It is also known for its characteristic twining of tails when groups are sitting together. White-eared titis can live for more than 25 years in captivity.

Despite this, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classified the species as being of least concern in 2008 as it has shown adaptability to habitat disturbance and is found over a wide range. == Taxonomy == The white-eared titi belongs to the New World monkey family Pitheciidae, which contains the titis, saki monkeys (Pithecia), bearded sakis (Chiropotes), and uakaris (Cacajao). It is a member of the subfamily Callicebinae. It was first described as Callicebus donacophilus in 1836. but was reassessed based on molecular evidence and recombined as a species within the genus Plecturocebus. Although the exact position of species within the genus Plecturocebus in the P. donacophilus group with the Rio Beni titi (P. modestus), Rio Mayo titi (P. oenanthe), Ollala brothers' titi (P. olallae), and white-coated titi (P. pallescens). The white-coated titi has sometimes been considered a subspecies of the white- eared titi, but they are treated as separate species in the latest edition of Mammal Species of the World. == Physical description == The white-eared titi is a medium-sized primate with grey to orange pelage. The species does not exhibit sexual dimorphism; the male's head and body length averages while females average . The white-eared titi's fluffy tail is longer than the length of its head and body together. It typically has thick fur, with a dorsal side and limbs that vary in colour from grey agouti to orange agouti, with an orange underside and white ear tufts. Body weight ranges from around , with the female generally a little lighter. It has the dental formula , meaning that on each side of the jaw it has two incisors, one canine tooth, three premolars, and three molar teeth. The canine teeth are relatively short when compared with other New World monkeys. In captivity, the white-eared titi has been known to live for over 25 years. == Behaviour == The white-eared titi is cryptic, diurnal and known to live in small family groups. It is a monogamous species that is thought to mate for life and lives in groups that usually consist of two to seven members; an adult pair and up to five young. Multi- male groups have also been recorded. Offspring are carried by the male, and are always with them, except when feeding. Between the ages of two to four years, offspring will disperse from the natal group, with females leaving earlier than the males. Young are carried during their first few months. There is a strong bond between the adult mating pair, they stay close and carry out activities together. Either member of the pair may follow the other and leadership changes through the day. Evidence of the strength of the pair bond is shown by grooming, huddling together with their tails twined, nuzzling, and gentle grasping. Titi monkeys are highly territorial and when confronted with another family group, both will respond with threatening behaviour, males showing increased agitation towards intruding males. When not close together, the pair show a significant amount of distress and agitation. Titi monkeys are well known for their vocal communication, and have a complex repertoire of calls. The calls can be divided into two categories: high-pitched quiet calls and low-pitched loud calls. Vocalisations are often combined and repeated to form sequences that are used to indicate distress, conflict, play, bonding, disturbance, and to strengthen territory. The high-pitched quiet calls are mostly used when the monkeys are disturbed, but may also be used before or after group calling, while foraging, or to find other members of the group. The loud low-pitched calls are mostly used in long distance group calling. Their function is to ensure adequate spacing between the home ranges of different family groups. These vocalisations are known as duets, and generally involve the male and female. If a neighbouring group is within earshot of these calls they will respond with their own duetting. The white-eared titi has a complex vocal repertoire. The white-eared titi is arboreal, spending most of its time in the lower strata of the forest. It may enter the main canopy when travelling longer distances and may also cross small areas of open ground, though the latter is rare. During normal movement through its environment it is quadrupedal and mostly walks, clambers and leaps, but it can also bound and climb. It leaps small distances, no more than a few body lengths, between trees where vegetation is not thick enough to support its primary forms of locomotion. When travelling on the ground it is said to use a \\"bounding movement\\" whereby it leaps more than off the ground. The titi monkey prefers branches which are less than in diameter and its tail never touches the support it is on. == Ecology == There is relatively little known about the ecology of the white-eared titi or even titi monkeys in general, and few studies have focused on the white-eared titi. It is diurnal, commencing activity around sunrise and continuing until sunset. Food availability may influence activity times; if there is an abundance of food in the warmer months when plants are fruiting titi monkeys may start earlier, or if there is a lack of food, titi monkeys may remain at the feeding tree into the evening. The titi monkey usually rests during the middle of the day and has two main feeding periods, in the morning and in the afternoon. It has an increased period of feeding towards the end of the day. In total, the titi monkey is active for an average of 11.5 hours, 2.7 hours of which is spent feeding. Titi monkeys sleep on branches at least above the ground. In the same manner as resting during the day, titi monkeys huddle together and twine tails to sleep. When resting as a group white-eared titis often twine tails together. Though there is little published research on the diet of the white-eared titi, titi monkeys in general are omnivores that eat fruit, leaves, insects, and seeds. They mostly eat leaves, especially protein-rich young leaves and leaf buds, so a significant period of the day is spent resting to digest the cellulose. They consume more than 100 different species of plants and fruit. Titi monkeys will also eat small insects (ants, moths, butterflies, and their cocoons), spiders, and can catch flying prey if it comes close to them. During the dry season there is an increased feeding time on leaves, and during lactation it is thought insect consumption increases to augment the protein content of the diet. The titi monkey may travel between during the day, and can maintain a home range of . During the dry season there is less fruit available and therefore less need to travel large distances, so the day range may only be a third of the usual distance. Its home range is often shared with other primate species including marmosets, squirrel monkeys, capuchins, owl monkeys, howler monkeys, and spider monkeys. It is sometimes chased from feeding sites by larger species, and will generally try to avoid other primates. === Habitat and distribution === The white-eared titi is found in tropical humid forests, preferring drier regions to more humid ones. It is found in riparian zones and gallery forests and is clearly associated with open habitats like grasslands and swampy grasslands. It is found in areas with dense vegetation, often choosing to inhabit the thickest parts of the forest. The species seems to be quite tolerant of habitat disturbance. In Bolivia, the white-eared titi is found in the upper parts of the Mamoré, Grande, and San Miguel river basins, east of the Manique River in Beni and in the forests surrounding the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. Its range extends north to southern Rondônia in Brazil. == Conservation status == The white-eared titi is considered to be of least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. The species is not considered threatened due to its adaptability and abundance over a relatively wide range, and despite having a decreasing population trend the decline is not rapid enough to be placed in a threatened category. The species is also listed on CITES Appendix II. The white-eared titi's main threat is deforestation and habitat loss due to agriculture. The area of greatest habitat loss is around the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, but it still survives within the city limits and on the edges of many rural establishments. It has few natural predators and is proven to be adaptable to habitat disturbance. Farmland may surround and isolate areas of titi habitat which occasionally has positive benefits to the monkey. Farmers may prevent hunters on the land, thereby inadvertently protecting the species. It also appears that the titi monkey can cross open ground between forest fragments, and some groups can thrive in disturbed habitats near human activities. However, the fragmented habitats may prevent the establishment of new territories and decrease reproductive opportunities. Forest corridors to connect fragmented forests have been proposed as an effective means to help ensure the survival of the titi monkey. The white-eared titi is found in the Beni Biological Station Biosphere Reserve and the Amboro National Park in Bolivia and benefits from the protection these reserves provide. == References == white-eared titi Category:Mammals of Bolivia Category:Mammals of Brazil white-eared titi ","title":"White-eared titi"},{"id":"3241592","text":"Jakov Ignjatović (, 8 December 1822 – 5 July 1889) was a novelist and prose writer, who primarily wrote in Serbian but also in Hungarian. ==Biography== Jakov Ignjatović was born in Szentendre on 8 December 1822. He finished elementary school in Szentendre and studied at the Gymnasium in Vác, Esztergom and Pest. He enrolled in Law School at Pest, but left the university and joined the hussars. Later, he graduated law in Kecskemét, where he started his law practice in 1847 for a short time, but during the Hungarian revolution of 1848 in a Romantic fervour, he joined Hungarian forces in fighting against the Austrians, in contradiction to what most Serbs and Croats in Austria of the time did, siding with the empire. He was briefly arrested when the revolution was suppressed. After the Hungarian defeat, Ignjatović fled to Belgrade. There he worked as a journalist till 1850, and later, he traveled the world. He returned to Hungary in 1853 and took an active part in the cultural and political life of Serbs in Vojvodina. Jakov Ignjatović by József Marastoni His efforts to secure equal educational privileges for the Slav and Romanian nationalities in the Austrian dominions brought him into disfavour with the German element. He was successively editor of \\"Letopis Matice srpske\\" (Serbian Annals), the \\"Srpske novine\\" (Serbian News), and the \\"Nedeljni list\\" (Weekend Magazine), between 1854 and 1856, and worked as a clerk in Sremski Karlovci and Novi Sad. He joined Svetozar Miletić's People's Party in its political fight against Austria and was member of the Hungarian diet twice. After the People's Party split with Hungary, he remained loyal to the Hungarian authorities, like Janos Damjanich and Sebo Vukovics, and unlike the majority of the Serbs living in Hungarian-occupied Serbian territory. And because of that, Ignjatović was seen as a traitor by his compatriots, and lived in isolation until death. This had a bad influence on his writing career, but he still managed to leave a literary legacy behind him just the same (among the Hungarians and Serbs alike). Ignjatović turned to novel writing rather late in life, perhaps influenced by the second half of the nineteenth century, then under the domination of science. Like most writers of the day, he sought to utilize as much as possible the facts and theories of science, and to make of the novel or drama an instrument of scientific observation and discussion. The Realists purported to create a school of \\"applied literature\\". The ultimate goal of the school was, first, exact and almost photographic delineation of the accidents of modern life, and secondly, non-suppression of the essential features and functions of that life which are usually suppressed. Jakov Ignjatović, Djordje Rajković (who collaborated with Ignjatović in 1885 and 1886 on a magazine called Bršljan) and Svetozar Marković belonged to this movement. Ignjatović was elected a member of the Serbian Royal Academy in 1888. At the end of life, possibly as a result of deteriorating health, he lost most of his fortune and died as a vagrant in Novi Sad in 1899. ==Works== Jakov Ignjatović on a 1975 Yugoslavia stamp Ignjatović did not hesitate to draw largely on his own personal adventures and profess to portray human life, not as a fairy-tale, but as \\"stuff on which to try the soul's strength.\\" Among Jakov Ignjatović's best novels are Vasa Rešpekt (Basil the Respectable), Večiti Mladoženja (The Eternal Groom), Patnica (A Burdened Woman), Trpen Spašen (The Suffered Saved), and Milan Nerandžić. All these novels form a prominent landmark in the development of Serbian prose fiction. The plots of Ignjatović's novels are ingenious in conception and skillfully crafted. He has no pretensions to the brilliance of Gogol (with whom he's been often compared), but his amusing dialogue arises naturally out of the situation, and its wit is never strained. Vasa Rešpekt (1875) opens with a praise of the town of Szentandre, the location in which this story is framed. The hero of the embedded story, Vasa Ognjan, leaves the town early, lives most of his life in perpetual poverty, and gets into conflict with the authorities, but distinguishes himself as somewhat of a daredevil in battles. In 1848, he fights on the Hungarian side, though not out of political conviction, and he asks to be transferred when he is supposed to fight his fellow Serbs. If Vasa Rešpekt is a romantic story revolving around an identity crisis, Večiti mladoženja (1878) is a humorous story about two generations of Szendendre Serbs. The first describes in great detail the preparation and departure of a well-to-do merchant on a trip to Cracow fair of 1812; the second part is focused on his no-good sons who fight among themselves for the inheritance and finally waste it. His characters are original, and the unexpected incidents and adventures in which they are mixed up are represented in an irresistibly comic manner by a man who thoroughly understood the resources of the theatre as well. The spontaneity and verve with which his adventurous characters are drawn have suggested that in his favourite type he was describing himself and all those he knew around him, however intimately. The code of morals followed by these characters is open to criticism, but they are human and genial in their roguery, and compare far from unfavourably with the cynical creations of contemporary novels. ==Bibliography== Novels: *\\"Đurađ Branković\\" (Đurađ Branković) *\\"Kraljevska snaha\\" (Royal Daughter-in-law) *\\"Deli-Bakić\\" - unfinished *\\"Čudan svet\\" (Strange World) *\\"Vasa Rešpekt\\" (Basil the Respectable) *\\"Večiti mladoženja\\" (Eternal Bridegroom) *\\"Stari i novi majstori\\" (Old and New Masters) *\\"Patnica\\" *\\"Trideset godina iz života Milana Narandžića\\" (Thirty Years of the Life of Milan Narandžić) Short stories: *\\"Krv za rod\\" (Blood for the People) *\\"Manzor i Džemila\\" (Manzor & Džemila) ==See also== *Serbian literature ==References== * Adapted from Serbian Wikipedia: Јаков Игњатовић * Translated and adapted from Jovan Skerlić's Istorija Nove Srpske Književnosti / History of Modern Serbian Literature (Belgrade, 1921), pp. 366–373.

It was first discovered by Shuji Kobayashi. It is considered one of the most endangered of all Neotropical primates. It is named after Adelmar F. Coimbra-Filho, founder and Former Director of the Rio de Janeiro Primate Centre, in honor of his work in the field of Brazilian primatology and biology. ==Physical description== The most distinct of Coimbra Filho's titi's features, from other members of the personatus group, include its black forehead, crown, and ear area, as well as a zebra-like pattern on the anterior of its back. Coimbra Filho's titi is also differentiated from other members of the personatus group by the shape of both its skull and its teeth. Compared to other members of its group, the skull is smaller, and shaped slightly differently. Its teeth are also more U-shaped, as opposed to the more V-shaped teeth exhibited by other members of the personatus group. It also features different dental topography on its upper first and second molars when compared to other members of the group. ==Habitat and distribution== The preferred habitat for Coimbra Filho's titi consists of densely wooded areas, preferring the dense understory and lower canopy. However, it is able to survive in damaged or fragmented forests, which currently comprise a large portion of its range. This is due to a tolerance to highly disturbed areas, as well as the ability to subsist in areas composed primarily of young or second growth forests. While other species in Callicebus are native to many areas of South America from Colombia to Brazil, Peru and north Paraguay, Coimbra Filho's titi is found only in a very small area in the states of Bahia and Sergipe in coastal northeastern Brazil. ==Behavior== Coimbra Filho's titi, like most titis, is a folivore-frugivore, with a diet consisting mostly of leaves, but also including various fruits. Coimbra Filho's titi generally lives in small groups consisting of three to five members. Such a group generally contains a breeding pair and its direct offspring that have yet to reach sexual maturity. However, upon reaching sexual maturity, individuals leave their natal groups, and often immigrate to new areas. Their range size varies, with some occurrences recorded of ranges as small as , and others larger than . Coimbra Filho's titi has also been noted to exhibit extreme territorial and defensive behavior when threatened. ==Conservation== Coimbra Filho's titi is currently considered endangered on the IUCN Redlist due to a variety of threats, both natural and anthropogenic, including habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, limited reproductive options, and increased predation. The primary biological threat to Coimbra Filho's titi comes from its mating behavior. While juvenile members of the species remain in their natal groups, upon sexual maturity they leave and set off upon their own. Coupled with the habitat fragmentation faced by the species, this behavior limits the number of sexually mature individuals in each fragment of the population, limiting reproductive options. The species' natural geographical distribution also contributes a threat to the species. Coimbra Filho's titi only naturally occurs in the Atlantic coastal forests in northeastern Brazil. This is a relatively small area in the states of Sergipe and Bahia. Due to this small range, any disturbances to these areas pose a larger than normal threat to the species' survival. More than anything else, however, human interference is the source of many problems to Coimbra Filho's titi. The areas around and inside its habitat are being developed, including paving roads and the promotion of tourism. Similarly, it is facing habitat loss due to increased logging in the area. Wooded areas inhabited by Coimbra Filho's Titi are also being rapidly converted into pastures for grazing and ranching. By the early 1900s, the coastal forests in Sergipe had been reduced to less than 40% of the size of their original cover. This trend continued throughout the 20th century, and these coastal forests now cover less than 1% of their original size. These activities are leading to increased habitat fragmentation. This fragmentation limits the size of breeding populations, limiting genetic diversity. This fragmentation also increases the risk of predation, as titis are forced to move from one fragment to another, exposing them to increased risk of predation. Coimbra Filho's titi was placed on Brazil's Official List of Threatened Fauna in 2003, managed by the Committee for the Conservation and Management of the Primates of the Northern Atlantic Forest and Caatinga. This organization is responsible for studying the current status and threats to the species, as well as developing and managing a plan for the species conservation. As of 2005, no attempts have been made at beginning a captive breeding program for the species, despite an estimated wild population of only 500 to 1000 individuals remaining. Current studies have shown that due to the species relatively large number of populations, as well as its tolerance to habitat loss and fragmentation, the species has a positive outlook. However action must be taken to prevent further habitat loss and fragmentation from threatening the species, as well as the implementation of plans to aid in the species' sustainability. ==References== Coimbra Filho's titi Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Coimbra Filho's titi ","title":"Coimbra Filho's titi"},{"id":"3241616","text":"Andrew Hall (born 1975) is a South African cricketer.

The goal was to enhance original Galaksija while keeping the original goal of keeping things inexpensive and simple for the constructor. Continuing to use Static RAM in Galaksija Plus would have significantly increased the cost, so designers decided to switch to dynamic, built out of 4416 chips. Larger memory prompted the need for faster cassette tape data recording rate, which was increased to 1200 bit/s by modifying another piece of firmware. Having enough memory to store the bit map and since Galaksija's own CPU directly drove the video signal, video generation hardware did not have to change significantly. Video generation routine was modified to take the raw video data from the new video memory instead of relying on character set ROMs. Some games for original Galaksija used to do a similar trick, albeit in a limited fashion due to restrictive memory capacity. The final hardware upgrade was addition of AY-3-8910 sound-generation chip, providing contemporary- standard sound to Galaksija without the need to use tricks such as with the cassette tape port (see original Galaksija).

It is named after for His Royal Higness Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. His Royal Highness Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands is a naturalist whom created the Order of the Golden Ark honoring conservationists in the world. It's a type of New World monkey, endemic to Brazil. It was formally described in 2002 by Marc van Roosmalen and Russell Mittermeier, and named after Prince Bernard of the Netherlands. Locals were shown a photograph of the monkey and asked if they knew of its whereabouts, it was referred to as a \\"Zog-Zog\\". == Physical Characteristics == This titi has dark orange sideburns and chest, a reddish-brown back, and a black tail with a white tip. The fur is soft and long. It is a medium-mid sized monkey. It is about 94 centimeters (37 in) in length, although 56 centimeters (22 in) is taken up by its tail. Males and females are of equal size. Their weight is 1-2 pounds. Their brain size is about 20-30mm. == Evolution == The Prince Bernhard's titi monkey belongs to the genus of New World primates within South America. The closest relatives of this titi monkey are the torquatas, personatus, donacophilus and moloch species groups. Their sister clade is the Pitheciidae. Prince Bernhard titi monkey jumps from branches as the derived titi monkey's name is \\"jumping monkey\\". New World Monkeys New world monkeys include platyrrhines that are distinguished by having far apart nostrils along with a prehensile tail. These monkeys are found in South and Central America as well as, Mexico. New world monkeys are also all arboreal, living within trees. == Habitat and Distribution == Prince Bernhard's titi monkey mainly resides in the tropics. Typically, South America in forests near water. Prince Bernhard's titi monkey is specifically found in the east of Rio Madeira and Rio Aripuana south of Amazon River. The Prince Bernhard's titi monkey has been spotted living at the Amazon River of Brazil. Prince Bernhard's titi monkey prefers damp, low rainforest canopy. This monkey is arboreal and typically does not go to the forest floor. == Behavior == The Prince Bernhard's titi monkey has a wide range of behaviors. Behaviors include, tail twining with two individuals wrapping their tails around each other, grooming, playing and moaning and making calls all with a close proximity. There are high-pitched calls and low- pitched calls. The titi monkey itself are typically frugivores and eat other invertebrates like insects and plants as well. The titi monkey uses its fingers and hands to grasp food. The Prince Bernhard's titi monkey lives into its twenties. === Family === Family groups of this monkey are territorial and their young typically leave and venture off after about 2 to 3 years. Family groups are also diurnal sleeping together within the same tree typically every night. This is an monogamous group. The length of the day does however vary with different seasons. The Prince Bernhard's titi monkey walks as quadrupedal; using all four feet to walk, leaps, jumps and climbs. Female's usually give birth to a single offspring after a 160 day gestation period, birthing one baby a year. Births typically occur within November to March. Males help care take for the baby. Males carry infants rather than females other than when nursing. When nursing, females carry their young. === Intelligence === The titi monkey uses sounds to communicate and have been found observing tools like plastic straws to obtain their food. === Conservation === The Prince Bernhard's titi monkey is of least concern today. On the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List (IUCN) this titi monkey proves its concern. The titi monkey is not threatened nor endangered due to its adaptability and copious amounts of the species. There is however a decline in their population trend. They are hunted by humans for meat.

This critically endangered species is endemic to the Caatinga in northeastern Brazil, and it is estimated that less than 250 mature individuals remain. It is named after the zoologist Barbara Elaine Russell Brown. ==Home range== The blonde titi monkey is listed as Critically Endangered due to small population size. The blond titi monkey is endemic to the Atlantic forests of eastern Brazil, where it is found in the coastal highlands of Bahia and Sergipe States. Most of their population is found between the Paraguaçu River (north) and Salvador (south), and west towards Mirorós. The estimated population is 260 individuals and is decreasing. ==Habitat and ecology== The blond titi prefers habitats in caatinga a dry scrubland with preferences for dense arboreal caatinga. They do tend to be largely arboreal forest dwellers, and the blond titi monkey probably rarely descends to the ground. They are small in size and are agile primates, they are good climbers through the branches on all four limbs, using their rear limbs to jump long distances, grasping onto branches with leading forehands. While resting, they hunch their body, hanging the tail over a branch. . ==Biology== The titi monkeys are most active at dawn and dusk foraging for fruits, leaves and insects, and rest at midday. The males will lead the group while foraging, communicating to the rest of the group with a wide array of vocalizations and visual signals. Titi monkeys are monogamous, with groups consisting of strongly-bonded parents and their offspring. Partners often reinforce the pair bond by perching side-by-side and entwining their tails. Females give birth annually, during the wet season, to a litter of just one, after a gestation period of five to six months. Juveniles grow rapidly to reach adult size within ten months. ==Major threat(s)== Since the titi monkey inhabits a region of Brazil they are subjected to a widespread of deforestation and habitat fragmentation. Cattle ranching, agriculture and continuing urbanization are the main threats. The area is in rapid development facilitated by an extensive network of highways. Other threats include potential dangers from roads and power-lines and predation by domestic pets. This species occurs in small fragmented populations that are exposed to synergistic genetic and demographic risks. Hunting pressure needs to be ascertained, but it is probably moderate due to the small body size. During surveys, a few individuals were found being kept as pets. The species is not found in any officially protected area. ==Conservation== Despite being home to numerous species found nowhere else in the world, only one percent of the forests of Bahia, home to the blond titi monkey, are under any form of protection and as a number of destructive activities continue to degrade the area, action is required to protect the blond titi monkey's habitat.(March, 2010) http://www.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/atlantic_forests.cfm Several organizations, including the Brazilian Institute for the Environment, are working to promote the study and protection of Brazil's threatened primates.2)(March, 2010) Conservation International is also helping to establish a Central Biodiversity Corridor that aims to connect fragmented forests, while WWF is developing an overall conservation strategy for Brazil's Atlantic forests. Further research is needed into the ecology and status of this enigmatic species if it is to be pulled back from the brink of extinction. ==References== Barbara Brown's titi Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Barbara Brown's titi ","title":"Barbara Brown's titi"},{"id":"3241677","text":"Magnus I (1304–1369), called the Pious (Latin Pius), was duke of Brunswick- Lüneburg. The son of Albert the Fat, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Magnus was still a minor when his father died in 1318; he and his brother Ernest were put under the guardianship of their elder brother Otto, who continued as sole ruler even after his brothers came of age. After marrying Sophia, a niece of Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, Magnus was appointed margrave of Landsberg and count palatine of Saxony by the Emperor in 1333. Magnus took residence at Sangerhausen. When Otto died in 1344, Magnus and Ernest jointly took over government of the state; but already on 17 April 1345, they agreed to divide the territory. Magnus received the Principality of Wolfenbüttel. In 1346, a border war between Wolfenbüttel and the Archbishop of Magdeburg broke out. In exchange for help in this conflict, Magnus sold the Margraviate of Landsberg to Frederick II, Margrave of Meißen. But the Archbishop conquered Schöningen in 1347, and Magnus had to cede Hötensleben and some other possessions to the Archbishop. Financially ruined by the war, Magnus could not stop the cities in the state from acquiring more and more rights; especially the City of Brunswick was becoming more powerful. In 1348, the Emperor gave Landsberg and the Palatinate of Saxony to Bernard, Prince of Anhalt. The ensuing conflict over these territories between Magnus and Bernard ended amicably with a marriage between Magnus' son Magnus and Catherine, daughter of Bernhard III, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg. Magnus attempted to secure the Principality of Lüneburg for his son Louis, so that it could be reunited with Wolfenbüttel. The prince of Lüneburg, William II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, a member of the same house to which Magnus belonged, the House of Welf, did not have sons; however, he had already promised the principality to a son of his daughter, a relative of the Duke of Saxony, before he agreed to Magnus' plan. Louis then married William's daughter Matilda. A lengthy conflict broke out that culminated in the Lüneburg Succession War, which was resolved only in 1388. In 1367, Magnus joined Dietrich, Archbishop of Magdeburg, Albert, Bishop of Halberstadt, Valdemar, Prince of Anhalt, and others in a campaign against Gerhard of Berg, Bishop of Hildesheim; they were defeated by Hildesheim in a battle near Farmsen and Dinklar on 3 September.(:de:Schlacht von Dinklar) Magnus was taken prisoner, and had to buy his freedom. He died in summer of 1369. ==Family== Around 1327, Magnus married Sophia (died 1356), the daughter of Henry I, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal. They had the following children that reached adulthood: * Magnus (died 1373) * Louis (died 1367), married Matilda, daughter of William II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg * Albert, Prince- Archbishop of Bremen (died 1395) * Henry, Provost of Halberstadt Cathedral * Ernest * Matilda, married Bernhard III, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg * Agnes, married in 1360 to Count Henry of Hohnstein * Sophie, married Count Dietrich V of Hohnstein ==Ancestry== ==References== *Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, vol. 20, p. 62-64 *Zedlers Universal-Lexicon, vol. 19, p. 240-241 *at the House of Welf site Category:Princes of Wolfenbüttel Category:14th-century births Category:1369 deaths Category:Old House of Brunswick ","title":"Magnus I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg"},{"id":"3241679","text":"The Baptista Lake titi, Plecturocebus baptista, is a species of titi, a type of New World monkey, endemic to Brazil.

Despite being retired, he continued to come into work nearly every day. Wolfenstein was a particle phenomenologist, a theorist who focused primarily on connecting theoretical physics to experimental observations. In 1978, he noted that the presence of electrons in Earth and Solar matter could affect neutrino propagation. This work led to an eventual understanding of the MSW effect, which acts to enhance neutrino oscillation in matter. Wolfenstein received the 2005 Bruno Pontecorvo Prize from The Scientific Council of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), for his pioneering work on the MSW effect. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1978. He was a founding member of the original Pittsburgh SANE (Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy) and a member of the Union of Concerned Scientists. In 1986, Wolfenstein was awarded the New Person Award by the Thomas Merton Center in Pittsburgh for his work in pursuit of nuclear disarmament: He led a lifetime of advocating for responsible science as well as for individual rights and liberties.

He helped lead his football and basketball teams to two state championships each. ==College career== Seubert attended Western Illinois University and played tight end as a freshman. In his sophomore year he moved to tackle and was a first team All-Gateway honoree as a senior. ==Professional career== Seubert joined the New York Giants as an undrafted Free Agent in 2001. He made an impression on the Giants, and in his second season, he started at left guard for every game. Seubert was at the center of an officiating controversy in the 2002 NFC playoffs, where the Giants faced the San Francisco 49ers. The Giants, who had led by a score of 38-14, were trailing 39-38 when Matt Bryant had a chance to kick a game-winning field goal. When Trey Junkin botched the snap, Seubert, an eligible receiver on the play, went out to try to catch holder Matt Allen's pass. Allen underthrew Seubert, who was grabbed and pulled down by Chike Okeafor, apparently drawing a pass interference penalty. Instead, an illegal man downfield penalty was called on Seubert, ending the game. The next day the NFL revealed that Seubert had checked in prior to the play, but one of his downfield teammates, Tam Hopkins, had not. Okeafor's interference call and the Hopkins call would have offset the penalties and forced a replaying of the down. The NFL drew a fair amount of criticism for the non-call on Seubert's play. The NFL later issued an official apology to the Giants in the offseason. The play ended up on NFL Top 10's Top Ten Meltdowns at #10 and #7 on Top Ten Controversial Calls. During a game against Philadelphia in October 2003, Seubert was blocking when his opponent N. D. Kalu stepped on the back of his right leg, breaking Seubert's tibia, fibula, and ankle. After 5 surgeries, he returned to play in 2005, mainly on special teams, or filling in for injured players, as Chris Snee had taken over as the starter. In December, he made his first start since the injury, helping Tiki Barber rush for a team-record 220 yards. His starting job was given back to him in the 2007 season. The Giants began to use Seubert as a tight end in 2006, but due to his jersey number (69), he must be announced over the public address system by the referees as an eligible receiver when he plays in that position. He was announced in this way roughly 20 times per game. On March 24, 2008, he signed a 3-year extension through 2012. Seubert started 16 games for the Giants in 2010, playing both guard and center. Seubert received praise for his solid performance from GM Jerry Reese, who remarked he was the MVP of the team. On July 28, 2011, the Giants announced they released Seubert. ==Personal life== Seubert is married and has three children. Hailey (Youngest), Isaac (Middle), and Hunter (Oldest).

It is located on the east side of Port Gamble, an inlet or bay of Hood Canal, and is directly across the bay from the unincorporated community of Port Gamble. Little Boston is within the Port Gamble Indian Reservation, which houses the Port Gamble band of the S'Klallam tribe. The Port Gamble S'Klallam Reservation consists of of land held in trust by the federal government. There is no private land ownership on the reservation. Most of the land is in forest with residential, business, and office areas. The land is listed by the U.S. Census Bureau as the Port Gamble Tribal Community census-designated place, with a population of 916 as of the 2010 census. The reservation receives approximately of rain per year due to its location in the Olympic Mountain rain shadow. The reservation lands rise from the beach to a gently rolling terrain. Port Gamble Bay is the last bay in Kitsap County that is still open for commercial shellfish harvest. The Tribe has a hatchery on Middle Creek. Bear, deer and other wildlife also live on the reservation. ==History== On June 16, 1938, the S'Klallam tribe receives a reservation on Port Gamble Bay, which is their historic home. At the time that the United States organized Oregon Territory in 1848, the S'Klallams lived in villages on the west side of Port Gamble Bay. In the summer of 1853, Josiah Keller arrived by ship to build a sawmill for the Puget Mill Co. He asked the Native Americans to move across the bay to make room for the mill and he offered free lumber for their homes, free firewood, and Christmas gifts. The S'Klallams agreed. Keller's mill prospered and many S'Klallams worked there. Eventually, the Puget Mill Co. and other lumber companies acquired title to all the land around Port Gamble Bay. The S'Klallams ceded their rights to the land in the treaty of Point No Point on January 26, 1855. Under that agreement, the tribe was supposed to move to a reservation along with the Skokomish. Few S'Klallams were interested in moving. They continued to take their living from the water and the land and they got jobs at the mill. Little Boston (named by a Yankee sea captain) consisted of frame homes built on the sand spit. Water was carried in a wood trough and residents used diversion boards to direct their share from the flume. The homes stood on stilts because of tides and sanitary facilities consisted of privies over the mudflats connected with wood walkways. Some individual S'Klallams bought their own land along the bay either for cash or under the Indian Homestead Act. Once the land had been logged, it was of little interest to the logging companies. Much of these titles were lost in the Great Depression when the owners could not pay county taxes. Under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the U.S. Government purchased land for reservations. The Department of the Interior bought up land from Puget Mill Co. and established the S'Klallam (spelled Clallam) Reservation in 1938. Health officials burned the community of Little Boston because it represented a health hazard, and new homes were built on the reservation. ==References== ==External links== * PortGamble.com * Kitsap County Visitor Information * Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe Category:Unincorporated communities in Washington (state) Category:Unincorporated communities in Kitsap County, Washington ","title":"Little Boston, Washington"},{"id":"3241774","text":"Monster Rancher 4 (known in Japan as ) is a monster breeding and management game that was released by Tecmo for the PlayStation 2 in 2003. ==Gameplay== Like the previous installments, this game involves the raising, breeding, and fighting of monsters.

His first major ventures both appeared in 1927. One was a collaboration with his mentor and predecessor at Country Life magazine, H. Avray Tipping, in Tipping's series In English Homes, Period IV, vol. 2, The Work of Sir John Vanbrugh and his School, 1699–1736 (1927). English garden history was an unexplored field when Hussey broke ground the same year with The Picturesque: Studies in a Point of View (1927; reprinted 1967), which was a pioneer in the history of taste that rediscovered from obscurity figures like Richard Payne Knight, \\"a Regency prophet of modernism\\" in Hussey's estimation. Later in Hussey's career, English Gardens and Landscapes 1700–1750 (1967), also covered fresh territory, as a complement to his Georgian volumes English Country Houses. He is chiefly remembered for the long series of articles he wrote from the 1920s onwards for Country Life (where he became architectural editor), in which he continued the work of his mentor Tipping in setting architectural history in its social history. Based on his accumulated experience in country houses and their muniment rooms, his series of English Country Houses: ECH: Early Georgian, 1715–1760, (1954?; revised, 1965); ECH: Mid-Georgian, 1760–1800 (1956) and ECH: Late Georgian, 1800–1840 (1958) provided an overview of high-style Georgian domestic architecture. 18th- century Georgian houses were widely admired, but at the time of publication Regency houses were not regarded, though a collectors' vogue for early 19th century furniture had spurred Margaret Jourdain's Regency Furniture (1934). \\"The surviving houses of the Regency period took on a new lease of life, partly thanks to Country Life authors such as Christopher Hussey who played a significant role in the rediscovery and popularisation of the Regency period\\" (Sir John Soane's Museum Newsletter 10) Hussey's series of monographs on selected houses and a series The Colleges of Oxford and Cambridge collected material drawn from his Country Life articles, offered in more permanent format: Petworth House, Clarence House, London, Ely House, London, Berkeley Castle, Eton College, Shugborough were all given the Hussey treatment, and they demonstrate the range of his competence. Hussey contributed the chapters on architectural history to H. Clifford Smith, Buckingham Palace: Its Furniture, Decoration & History (1931; reprinted 1937) He wrote monographs on the conservative contemporary British architect Sir Robert Lorimer (1931) and The Life of Sir Edwin Lutyens, which historian David Watkin rated \\"the finest architectural biography\\" in English. Lutyens' first big London office building was the Country Life Building (1904) in Covent Garden, commissioned by the magazine's editor, Edward Hudson. With A.S.G. Butler and George Stewart Hussey contributed to the definitive three-volume Architecture of Sir Edwin Lutyens (1950), the opening shot in the ongoing reappraisal of Lutyen's buildings. Nevertheless, Hussey's Country Life articles on contemporary houses are often overlooked. In the next generation, Hussey's example influenced John Cornforth, with whom he co-wrote the later editions of Hussey's Guide to English Country Houses Open to the Public (first published by Hussey in 1951), and who wrote a series of Country Life articles in 1981 \\"Continuity and Progress: Christopher Hussey and Modern Architecture\\" (Country Life, vol. CLXIX, 22 October 1981, pp. 1366–68, etc.) To a lesser extent Hussey's example influenced Mark Girouard, whose Life in the English Country House (1979) took a new view, concerned with life downstairs as well as with architects and their patrons among the gentry. == Books == * Hussey, Christopher and Tipping, H.

The Rio Mayo titi, was thought previously to have a small range of origin in the Alto Mayo valley, but research has proven that the range extends southward and reaches the Huayamba River,http://content.ebscohost.com/pdf25_26/pdf/2011/IJP/01Aug11/62910120.pdf?T=P&P;=AN&K;=62910120&S;=R&D;=aph&EbscoContent;=dGJyMNLe80SeqLI4zdnyOLCmr0uep69SsKq4SrKWxWXS&ContentCustomer;=dGJyMPGutkyura9PuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA as well as Bajo Mayo. It had been classified as vulnerable but due to major habitat loss and restricted living space, it is now classified as Critically Endangered. In October 2012, it was included in The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates list. An increase in deforestation is leading to the decrease in available living space for this titi monkey, forcing it to live in sympatry with another species of Callicebus. Yet in some areas, such drastic deforestation has resulted in extremely high population density. The Rio Mayo titi is better adapted to moderately populated areas, thus overpopulation negatively impacts the species. The forests the Rio Mayo titi lives in are being destroyed for agricultural purposes, leaving little forest for the monkeys. They were only seen a few times and featured in museums until 2003 when more research was done on them. In order for this species to survive, their forests need to be protected to avoid overpopulation. Different conservation groups are working to help P. oenanthe survive. Neotropical Primate Conservation, Proyecto Mono Tocón and Amazónicos para la Amazonia are working in the more southern areas to protect the monkey.http://www.primate- sg.org/storage/pdf/PC26_Shanee_GIS%20risk%20assessment_C.%20cupreus.pdf The Rio Mayo titi is a fairly inconspicuous creature, making observation and research difficult to obtain. Therefore, the traditional use of transect observation to monitor the monkey's population, is less effective. Instead, other methods of calculating the titi monkey's density in certain areas have been taken, such as research into the species-specific calls endemic to a certain area. ==Location, habitat and activity== Rio Mayo titis usually live in dry woodland areas with a lot of vines and plants. They are found in the Atlantic Coast of Brazil and in tropical areas of the Amazon, the upper Paraguay basin, in Boirio, and Santa Cruz. They are found in Peru in the northern part of the Department of San Martin, at altitudes of 750–950 meters and also in the foothills of the Andes. One P. oenanthe family was studied by scientist DeLuycker from October 2004 to September 2005. The studied family consisted of a mother and father, two offspring, and a baby born within the study period. The family was observed to live in bamboo stands and low forests with trees with a mean height of 6.8 meters. The family used only five sleeping sites during the year-long study time, two of them only rarely. Sleeping and resting was the most common activity, followed by traveling, and then eating and foraging. The P. oenanthe also socialized with others of their own kind. However, forest degradation and disturbed habitats had a negative effect on P. oenanthe sociability. ==Diet== The diet of the Rio Mayo titi consists of mostly leaves, seeds, fruits, and arthropods. In one study, it was found that 54% of their diet was fruit, and 22% insects (consisting of at least 10 different types of insects), with the remainder consisting of leaves, tendrils, meristems, flowers and seeds. The 22% of the P. oenanthe diet that consists of insects is gathered in a variety of ways. There are three main types of foraging technique that the species uses to catch insects: lunging and grabbing exposed prey, biting and inspecting hidden prey, and stealth foraging or scanning for prey. Out of the three techniques, the most frequently used technique for hunting insects was found to be lunging and grabbing exposed prey. They have a high success rate of catching insects, reaching up to 83%. This species' ability to hunt insects so easily is especially important for survival in times of scarce food availability. ==Appearance== The appearance of the Rio Mayo titi varies based on their location. In one part of Ecuador, the titis were seen to have reddish brown fur on their back, limbs and chest and lighter reddish brown fur in the on the outside of their limbs. They had a dark brown-red forehead, sideburns and beard and small white tufts of fur coming out of their ears. They had a light colored throat, black hands, tail and nails and cream colored underparts with white hairs on their muzzle. Their fur was short and spikey. In another part of Ecuador, the titis had a light red fur on their forehead, sideburns and beard, quite a lot of fur by their ears, dark hands with white fur on them, red underparts and chest, a gray tail and whitish hair above their nose, eyebrows and muzzle. Their fur was frizzy. ==Diseases== The cestode Atriotaenia megastoma has only recently been studied in non-human hosts. This parasite, a type of tapeworm, has been found in numerous species of monkeys in the Peru area such as Saimiri sciureus and Saimiri boliviensis. This parasite requires an intermediate host usually found in the soil fauna. The host then acquires the parasite by accidentally ingesting the intermediate host from the soil. Work performed in Peru shows that P. oenanthe is a new definitive host for this parasite. In February and October 2004, six sightings of this parasite were found in the small intestines of two different P. oenanthe monkeys. These monkeys were male pets, donated to the experiment by local villagers. One monkey died of old age while the other died from hepatic cirrhosis. Before their death, samples of Atriotaenia megastoma were taken, dehydrated, and preserved in order to study their anatomy and reproductive organs. These new preserved specimens allowed for a new and better understanding of this parasite. Ultimately, the study showed that P. oenanthe is a new, definitive host for the parasite, and could be another factor in the species' decline. ==Conservation efforts== After discovering the distribution of the species and where it primarily lives, the next step in conserving it is determining the densities of the species, creating protected areas specifically for this animal, and expanding existing ones. To find the density of the P. oenanthe, a triangulation method is used, where three points are set up and the species is observed within the area created by these points. While density was measured by using this method and also examining the trees by their density, height, and distance from one another, human disturbance is also monitored. This study described was performed in Ojos de Agua in Guanajuato, Mexico. This study was part of a larger study created by Program Management Team (PMT) to study the habitat requirements of P. oenanthe and exploring the possibility of creating corridors between species fragmented distributions. ==References== ==External links== Rio Mayo titi Category:Mammals of Peru Category:Endemic fauna of Peru Category:Critically endangered animals Category:Critically endangered biota of South America Rio Mayo titi ","title":"Rio Mayo titi"},{"id":"3241837","text":"Tōshōdai-ji in Nara , also Ritsu school, is one of the six schools of Nara Buddhism in Japan, noted for its use of the Vinaya textual framework of the Dharmaguptaka, one of the early schools of Buddhism.

As it is a member of this family, it is classified as a type of New World monkey. It is endemic to eastern Colombia, and the only member of the Plecturocebus moloch group to occur north of the Rios Amazonas/Solimes/Napo axis, living at least 350 km away from the closest other member, the white-tailed titi (Plecturocebus discolor), which lives in the south of Colombia. It was once classified as the same species as the white- tailed titi, but is now officially recognized as its own species. The ornate titi is also terrestrial. The ornate titi is present on the IUCN Red List of endangered species, being recognized as “Vulnerable”, and having a general decrease in population trends. == Description == The ornate titi has a thick, dense, fluffy, coat, with white ears and forehead, and grey hands and feet. The rest of the body is a bright chestnut red, apart from the tail, which is a dark-reddish brown or black, becoming white at the tip, and, similar to most titi species, is longer than its body. Male and female ornate titis do not differentiate significantly in appearance, however, generally, females tend to be larger, with an average male body length of 633 mm, and an average female body length of 752 mm. == Biology == === Habitat and threats === The ornate titi lives in the department of Cundinamarca (Medina) north as far as the lower Ro Upa/Ro Meta, and south into the department of Meta, along the base of the Cordillera Oriental and the Sierra de la Macarena to the Ro Guayabero/upper Ro Guaviare. It mainly inhabits the tropic and sub-tropic levels of the forest, generally preferring areas with dense vegetation, such as thickets, tangles, thorny underbrushes and wet or even waterlogged areas. The ornate titi tends to sleep in vine tangles located on small branches of trees, generally preferring to be at least off of the ground. Like other members of the moloch group, the ornate titi is considered tolerant of seasonal flooding and disturbances within its habitat, and is commonly found living in areas of forest disturbed by humans, in particular thriving on highly disturbed habitats. However, due to the continuous expanding of human settlements and therefore declination of both the size and quality of the ornate titi’s habitat, the presence of the species has become severely fragmented, with the current approximate area of habituated land around 20,000 km a decline of 30% in the last 24 years, and has been listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN since 1994 and is listed on Appendix II of CITES. Decline in habitat has also lead to a change in population, with a recorded population density of 5 individuals/km, and a general decreasing population trend. === Diet === The ornate titi is an omnivore, but its diet is mainly frugivorous, their diet consisting of 70% fruit, 26% leaves, and less than 1% insects, usually with a preference for fruit that is not ripe, or that comes from smaller trees, as they can more efficiently exploit the more concentrated supply. However, they will also eat small (Generally less than 2 cm long) insects, such as moths, butterflies, cocoons, spiders, and ants, and are able to catch flying insects out of the air. Out of the leaves which make up more than quarter of their diet, the ornate titi tends to prefer small leaves and buds, and during the dry season, their diets will become a lot more vine and bamboo based. === Lifestyle === Due to their mainly herbivorous diet, the ornate titi spends a significant portion of the day sleeping. They usually spend around 60% of their time sleeping, which hugely differs from the white-tailed titi (P. discolor), which spends less than 25%. The ornate titi is diurnal, rising early in the morning and remaining awake and active until sunrise, however this depends on the season, due to the change in availability in food, particularly fruit, which tends to only appear in abundance in the warmer months. In contrast, an ornate titi may stay in sleeping site for up to four hours after sunrise in colder months. Usually, a titi's daily activity lasts for around 11.5 hours, with feeding taking up around 2.7 hours. Their day is typically split into two feeding sessions, one in the morning and one in the evening, with a resting session at around midday. The last few hours of the day are generally spent feeding on leaves. === Predators === The predominant and most important predators of all titis are raptors. Several species of raptor have been observed attacking a titi, including the Guianan crested eagle (Morphnus guianensis) and the Ornate hawk-eagle (Spizaetus ornatus). Tufted capuchins (Cebus apella) have also been observed killing and consuming an ornate titi. === Reproduction and infant behaviour === The ornate titi is monogamous, and their upbringing is entirely paternal, only ever being passed to the mother to be fed. with the birth season being from December to March, with the smallest infants being born in December to January. The average gestation period for an ornate titi is 128 days (4.2) months, and there have been observations that, during lactation, female titis tend to increase the amount of protein in their diet (Primarily by eating more insects). ==Conservation== Some conservation efforts within Colombia have been made, since the species occurs in La Macarena National Park and Tinigua National Park, and although some populations have been observed in protected areas, guerilla activity makes it difficult to monitor. ==References== ornate titi Category:Mammals of Colombia Category:Endemic fauna of Colombia ornate titi ","title":"Ornate titi"},{"id":"3241861","text":"Indian Island is an Unincorporated community in Jefferson County, Washington, United States.

It is located on Colvos Passage on Puget Sound just north of the Pierce County county line. Olalla used to be as large as Port Orchard, the county seat of Kitsap County. Olalla was settled in its early years by a large number of Norwegian and other Scandinavian immigrants because of its similarities to their native countries. Noted as early as the 1860s Olalla developed a commerce center by way of its good sea water access. The \\"old town\\" port located by the Olalla lagoon was made up by many business buildings, most on piers. Shipping and the mosquito fleet (ferrying system at that time) was very busy moving materials, goods and people. Olalla's name is the Salishan and Chinook Jargon word for \\"berry\\" or \\"berries\\" (usually olallie or ollalie in most lexicons of the jargon). By the end of the 19th century the cutting down of all old growth forest was well on its way out. Olalla was no exception. The land was stripped clean leaving a barren landscape. This created an opportunity for farming as dynamiting stump and clearing the land became a standard operation. With European immigration fueling the growth spurt, new commerce came by growing strawberries and vegetables. Olalla being a port of commerce flourished as the logging, farming and boat building were king. Olalla was served by many steamship including the Virginia V which is the last operational example of a Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet steamer. She was built along the shores just south of Olalla near Maplewood. She was once part of a large fleet of small passenger and freight carrying ships that linked the islands and ports of Puget Sound in Washington state in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. On 21 October 1934, a severe Pacific storm swept through the Puget Sound. Virginia V was attempting to dock at Olalla, when the brunt of the storm hit. The powerful winds pushed the ship against the dock as the waves pounded the ship into the pilings. The result was the near destruction of the upper decks. All is gone now. Since the Narrows Bridge was built Olalla has enjoyed a quiet rural setting. Since the Second Narrows Bridge it is being converted into a residential community for commuters to nearby cities and towns. Al's Grocery Store is the only old structure left by the lagoon and the locals hold it dear to their hearts. On the way up hill along the Olalla Valley Road from the lagoon, the Olalla Bible Church and the Olalla Community Club stand. The OCC was built around 1906 by the Modern Woodsman of America and in 1937 they deeded the structure to the community. The OCC was incorporated and chartered to serve the community. It is rare treasure passed on by generations of Olalla families. Olalla Community Club Its mission is to support the citizen, organizations and maintain the building for social and civic needs. Over the decades several renovations have taken place. In 1976 the OCC created its non-profit status and September 2007 a new metal roof was installed. The current president is Marty Kellogg. Next to the OCC is the Olalla Bible Church, built around 1910. Together they represent some of the oldest and largest historic buildings still in working order in South Kitsap. Throughout Olalla's history the strong sense of community has played out in various forms of a community celebrations. Most notable was the Strawberry Festivals in the 60's and beginning in 1991, a 25-year run with the Olalla Bluegrass Festival. Currently the name has changed to the Olalla Americana Festival to support a wider genre of music. Olalla has some small claim to fame as the location of an early 20th-century health retreat (Sanitarium) called Wilderness Heights a.k.a. \\"Starvation Heights\\". The sanitarium was owned and operated by Dr. Linda Burfield Hazzard. Hazzard's practice of starvation to cure one's ills resulted in the death of a visiting English heiress in 1911, and the conviction of Hazzard for her murder. The original bathtub where Hazzard performed autopsies is still in the house, which has a family residing there. Olalla author Gregg Olsen wrote about Starvation Heights in his award-winning book of the same name. ==See also== *List of Chinook Jargon placenames ==References== * M.S.

Its population in the 2010 Census was 11,195, having fallen from 13,056 recorded in the 2002 Census and 11,935 in the 1989 Census. The population includes a few hundred ethnic Estonians. ==History== Pechory was founded as a posad in the 16th century near the Pskov-Caves Monastery established in 1473 by orthodox priest Jonah who fled Dorpat (now Tartu) for the Pskovian mainland. Its name, Pechory, or earlier Pechery derives from the word \\"peshchery\\" (пещеры), Russian for caves. The site soon developed into an important trading post and border stronghold. During the campaign of oprichnina introduced by Ivan the Terrible, Pechory remained within zemschina, or regular municipal lands subject to the rule of the government. It was besieged numerous times by Russia's enemies: Stephen Báthory's forces sacked the settlement during the Siege of Pskov in 1581–1582, and the Swedes or Polish stormed Pechory in 1592, 1611, 1615, and 1630, and from 1655 to 1657. The fortification of Pechory was besieged by Swedes in the course of the Great Northern War in 1701 and 1703. In 1701, after an unsuccessful Swedish assault led by Shlippenbach, Boris Sheremetev began his campaign of advancing into Swedish Estonia from Pechory. After the war the Russian border was shifted westwards so Pechory lost its military significance. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into the Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as the Saint Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, the separate Novgorod Governorate was split off and in 1772, the Pskov Governorate was established; it existed as Pskov Viceroyalty between 1777 and 1796. In 1776, Pechory was granted town rights and the Pechorsky Uyezd was established. However, in 1797, the uyezd was abolished and the territory became a part o f the Pskovsky Uyezd of the Pskov Governorate. From then on, Pechory was formally considered as a suburb of Pskov, however retaining its former rights of self-administration. In 1820 it had a population of 1,312, including 1,258 Russians and 27 Estonians, living in 228 predominantly wooden houses. By 1914 the population grew to 2,240, residing along eleven streets and five squares. The streets were equipped with 31 kerosene street lights. In 1889, the Pskov- Riga railroad that went through the northern outskirts of Pechory was commissioned.РГИА, ф. 446, оп. 28, д. 23. «Об окончании строительства Риго- Псковской железной дороги и об открытии движения по ней».

There were leather and malt factories in the town, a postal and telegraph station, four schools including one maintained by the monastery, and a hospital. Pechory was known for its flax trade, that was further expanded during the consequent Estonian period of the town's history. From February to December 1918, Pechory was occupied by the Germans. During the Estonian War of Independence and, simultaneously, the Russian Civil War, the town was occupied by the Estonian army on March 29, 1919. The centre of the Governorate, Pskov, was occupied by the anti-Bolshevik Russian Northwestern Army, that was later in August 1919 repelled back by the Red Army. Under the terms of the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty that stipulated the border along the actual front line between the Red and Estonian Armies, so Pechory and the adjacent Western part of Setomaa were ceded to Estonia. During the years between the World Wars, Petseri, as it was called at that time, was the centre of Petseri County, one of the eleven counties that made up the Republic of Estonia. Under Estonian rule, the town's population more than doubled, predominantly due to the arrival of ethnic Estonians. Tuition at the municipal primary schools was conducted in both Russian and Estonian, with more bias toward the latter following the Schools Reform of 1934.R. Ruutsoo.

Lk. 203–204 In May 1925, most of the land owned by the Pskov-Caves Monastery was confiscated by the Estonian government and provided to new settlers. St. Peter's Lutheran Church was built in 1926. In 1939, a huge fire broke out in the town, destroying 212 wooden buildings and killing many inhabitants.Небывалый пожар в Петсери — сгорело 212 домов // Вести дня. № 116 (4074). 1939 г., 25 мая. After the occupation of Estonia by the Soviet Union in 1940, the town initially remained part of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. During World War II, the town was occupied by the German Army from July 10, 1941 until August 11, 1944 and administered as part of the Reichskommissariat Ostland. According to a decree of USSR Supreme Soviet dated 23 August 1944 and a decree dated January 16, 1945, Pechory and the eastern part of Petseri County were transferred to the Pskov Oblast of the Russian SFSR, and the Pechorsky District was established.Administrative- Territorial Structure of Pskov Oblast, p. 14 During the Soviet period, bilingual schooling continued,and in 1956, Pechory Secondary School No. 2 was opened for Estonian-speaking students. In 1976, the town's boundaries were further expanded to encompass the railway station and a few adjacent villages, including Kunichina Gora,Административно-территориальное деление Псковской области (1917—2000 гг.): Справочник / Арх. упр.

After Estonian independence was re-established in 1991, the town and the territory around it were claimed by Estonia because of the terms of the Tartu Peace Treaty, in which the Soviet Union had relinquished further claims to Estonian territory.Georg von Rauch (1974). The Baltic States: The Years of Independence, 1917–1940. London: C. Hurst & Co. Estonia was reported to have dropped this claim in November 1995. A new Estonian- Russian Border Treaty was signed by Estonia on May 18, 2005, reflecting the later border changes,http://www.estemb.se/estonian_review/aid-427 Estonian Parliament ratifies Estonian-Russian border treaties but was rejected and cancelled by Russia on June 27, 2005, because references to \\"Soviet occupation\\" were added by the Estonians. A series of inter-governmental consultations took place in the decade that followed, and on February 18, 2014 the new version of the Border Treaty was signed by both countries. The latest version leaves the agreed border intact with a few minor exemptions not affecting the town of Pechory. Its parliamentary ratification by both sides is pending. ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, Pechory serves as the administrative center of the Pechorsky District, to which it is directly subordinated.Law #833-oz stipulates that the borders of the administrative districts are identical to the borders of the municipal districts. The Law #420-oz, which describes the borders and the composition of the municipal districts, lists the town of Pechory as a part of Pechorsky District. As a municipal division, the town of Pechory, together with forty-two rural localities, is incorporated within the Pechorsky Municipal District as the Pechory Urban Settlement.Law #420-oz ==Religion== Pechory is famous for the Russian Orthodox Pskov-Caves Monastery. Also, St.Peter's Evangelical Lutheran church is situated in the town. It is famous for its historic organ. ==Culture== During the 1930s Russian song festivals inspired by similar Estonian events were held in the town.C.Г. Исаков. Очерки истории русской культуры в Эстонии. Таллинн, 2005. C. 18–21. Pechory hosts a museum, two libraries, cultural centre and an arts school for children. Apart from the official and religious events, festivals on Maslenitsa and Ivan Kupala are held there.

It is also a small, eponymous bay, along which the community lies, near the entrance to Hood Canal. The unincorporated communities of Port Gamble and Little Boston, part of Kitsap County, lie on the west and the east side, respectively, of the mouth of this bay. The Port Gamble Historic District, a U.S. National Historic Landmark, covers one of the nation's best-preserved western lumber towns. The community of Port Gamble has a wide range of shops from antiques to a tea shop to an old-fashioned general store. It is a popular tourist destination, due to its location near Bremerton, Port Townsend, Bainbridge Island, and Seattle. Port Gamble is home to the grave of Gustave Englebrecht, the first U.S. Navy sailor to die in the Pacific.Legends of America ==History== Port Gamble, 1900 Gamble Bay was named by the Wilkes Expedition in 1841. The source of the name is unclear. Wilkes often named places after historical figures, and speculation centers on Lt. Col. John M. Gamble, an illustrious figure in the War of 1812; or U.S. Navy Lt. Robert Gamble, an officer aboard the frigate wounded in an exchange with . But the name may have had a more prosaic origin. Wilkes's published account of the expedition omits mention of either Gamble but does say that a lieutenant's survey party \\"[o]n entering [Hood's] canal [at what would become Gamble Bay] camped near some Suquamish Indians who had received as visitors a party of fifty Clalams, by appointment to gamble for blankets: they continued their games throughout the night.\\"—from (volume IV pp 410-411) The community, originally known as \\"Teekalet\\" and later renamed \\"Port Gamble\\" for the bay which gave it access to ocean commerce, was founded as a company town by Josiah Keller, William Talbot, and Andrew Pope's Puget Mill Company in 1853. In 1856, the was sent from Seattle to Port Gamble on Puget Sound, where indigenous raiding parties from British and Russian territories had been enslaving local Native Americans. When the warriors refused to hand over those among them who had attacked the Puget Sound Native American communities, Massachusetts landed a shore party and a battle ensued in which 26 natives and 1 sailor were killed. In the aftermath of this, Colonel Isaac Ebey, the first white settler on Whidbey Island, was shot and beheaded on August 11, 1857, by a Haida raiding party in revenge for the killing of a native chief during similar raids the year before. British authorities demurred on pursuing or attacking the northern tribes as they passed northward through British waters off Victoria, and Ebey's killers were never caught.Bancroft says they were Stikines, a Tlingit subgroup, and makes no mention of the Haida. Hubert Howe Bancroft, History of Washington, Idaho, and Montana: 1845-1889, p.137 (1890) The first school in the county went up in 1859, and the community took its present name in 1868. In 1966, the town of Port Gamble was designated a National Historic Landmark District. In 1985, Pope & Talbot, the successor company to Puget Mill, split into Pope & Talbot and Pope Resources,orm.com the latter of which took over the site and the sawmill. In 1995, the mill shut down after 142 years, ending the longest span of operation of any sawmill in the country. Walker-Ames house in Port Gamble ===Founding=== In 1849, William Talbot and Andrew Pope arrived in San Francisco from East Machias, Maine, in hope of taking part in its shipping and lumber industry, for the shipping of lumber to the rapidly growing Western United States was becoming a very lucrative business. Pope and Talbot quickly realized that the lumber shipments from New England were not enough to meet the growing demand for building materials in the West. After hearing about the dense forests in the Oregon Territory, Talbot and Pope, along with partners Josiah Keller and Charles Foster, formed the Puget Mill Company to harvest the much-needed lumber for the expanding West.David Wilma, \\"Port Gamble\\", HistoryLink.org- the Free Online Encyclopedia of Washington. Aug 07, 2003. http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file;_id=5505, (accessed November 21, 2010). In the summer of 1853, Talbot, after searching the Puget Sound area for the best possible site for a mill, spotted a sand spit at the mouth of Gamble Bay as an excellent location, for it provided a location near the abundant trees of the Oregon Territory and a port for shipping the cut lumber to California. Soon after arriving, Keller sailed up the coast to join him with the boiler, engine, and muley saw for the mill. By September, the new mill was cutting logs into lumber. Although they had a ready and working mill, Pope, Keller, and Talbot had difficulty finding enough workers to run the mill. During the 1850s, the Pacific Northwest was frontier territory with little population. With the help of their partner in Maine, Charles Foster, the mill was able to recruit experienced mill workers from East Machias to come west to Gamble Bay. In their new and labor-intensive environment, workers quickly became homesick for the lifestyle they had left behind in Maine. As houses were constructed for workers' and company executives' families, the design reflected their desire to feel at home, as the architecture looked like that which could be found in a New England city. This new little town that grew up by the mill was named \\"Port Gamble\\" after its location on Gamble Bay, which had been named by the American explorer Commodore Wilkes in 1842.The Port Gamble Story, 1853-1953, Port Gamble, WA: Pope & Talbot, retrieved from Washington State University Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections. The founders of the mill of Port Gamble, however, were not the first to occupy Gamble Bay. The S'Klallams, or Nux Sklai Yem, had been living in the Puget Sound region since 2400 B.C.Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe, Governor's Office of Indian Affairs, http://www.goia.wa.gov/Tribal-Information/Tribes/portgambleskallam.htm (accessed November 21, 2010). Legally, land wasn't available for non-Native settlement until March 8, 1859, when Congress ratified the Treaty of Point No Point, which was signed January 26, 1855, by representatives of the United States and the Chemakum, S'Klallam and Skokomish nations. But by that time, the Port Gamble Band of S'Klallam Indians had moved across the bay to Point Julia. As part of an agreement between them and the mill company, the S'Klallams were given jobs at the mill and lumber to build their new homes, community facilities, and a new school. The new little town across Gamble Bay became known as Little Boston. ===Tree farms=== As the Port Gamble mill continued to expand and increase its production of lumber, their need for suitable logging areas increased. The Puget Mill Company continued purchasing viable timberland, and by 1892 had ownership of .Pope & Talbot Inc. Funding Universe. The Gale Group, n.d. Web. http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company- histories/Pope-amp;-Talbot-Inc-Company-History.html (accessed November 24, 2010). With the depletion of forestland in other states, more and more companies turned to Washington to supply the growing need for timber. By 1906 there were over 900 lumber mills of various sizes in Washington alone. As Washington's old-growth forests were dwindling, the need for new sources of lumber became readily apparent. On June 12, 1941, the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company designated the first certified tree farm, the Clemons Tree Farm in Washington state.Shaun Trujillo, \\"Peeling Back the Bark: American Tree Farm System Records\\", https://foresthistory.org/new-collection-american-tree-farm- system-records/ (accessed December 1, 2010). The Puget Mill Company, now known as Pope & Talbot, Inc., soon followed suit, forming the Hood Canal Tree Farm in 1946 and having in it by 1953. === Economic boom of Port Gamble=== During the mid-1800s, California experienced an expansive economic boom and an increase in population from the California Gold Rush. The gold rush opened the door to a vast unknown of resources and fortune. The constant flow of settlers into the frontier and expanding economic influence demanded a high level of resources to maintain stability and growth. California then looked to tap into the high abundance of timber and mining in the Oregon Territory. This called for three explorers to set sail up along the Pacific Coast to explore the unknown territory. When William Talbot, Andrew Pope, and Josiah Keller washed up on the sandy shores of the Hood Canal they discovered the fortune of timber along the Olympic Peninsula. Talbot, a lumber merchant from the San Francisco area, partnered with Pope who was an experienced sea captain. The characteristics of the two men drove them through the ups and downs of global economic woes and stiff competition, especially their eventual counterparts in the Oregon Territory. After the founding of Port Gamble, these three men established the longest-working lumber mill on the North American continent. Port Gamble established itself as an industrial power house globally. The Puget Mill Company became a source of lumber all around the world from Shanghai to Cape Town, South Africa. Trees coming straight from the Olympic Peninsula were shipped to 37 other ports around the world. By 1862, the Puget Mill Company owned a fleet of ten vessels and was shipping almost 19 million board feet of lumber to foreign outlets.Douglas Davis. \\"Port Gamble: Unique Historical Restoration Project.\\" Journal of Forest History 19 (1975):137-139. During the turn of the century, the Puget Mill Company and the Pope and Talbot Lumber Company shipped their lumber from Port Gamble across the Atlantic Ocean to be used in the British, French and Russian navies for their sparring around the world. Captain Keller took hold of the shipment plans for the Pope and Talbot Lumber Company and created routes along the Pacific Coast to help supply the large demands of the California Gold Rush. This transportation of lumber opened the door for shipments to China and Southeast Asia. Because Talbot and Pope hailed from the state of Maine, their connections to the East Coast and constant travels back to their hometown, many of the ports along South America and the West Indies experienced contact from the Port Gamble shipments. === Sale of Puget Mill Company=== In July 1925, the board of directors for the Puget Mill Company, including William H. Talbot, George A. Pope Sr., Talbot C. Walker, John Deahl and A.G. Harms, met to discuss the sale of the company.Edwin T. Coman and Helen M. Gibbs, Time, Tide, and Timber (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1949), 255. A little over a year earlier in May 1924, William Talbot had already reached his own decision regarding the future of the Port Gamble mill. In a letter to Northwest Operations Manager, E.G. Ames, Talbot mentioned that it was \\"suicidal to continue operating the Port Gamble Mill.\\" He also informed Ames that production of lumber at the mill must cease once all remaining orders had been filled. When the board of directors met over a year later it took only a few minutes for them to decide that selling the company was the only option. After the meeting had concluded, Talbot met with Charles McCormick of the Charles McCormick Lumber Company, who agreed to purchase the Puget Mill Company for $15 million. This was a significant period in the history of Port Gamble and the Puget Mill Company. For almost a hundred years the Puget Mill Company had been owned and operated by the descendants of the Pope and Talbot families, but this sale meant that the mill would no longer be operated by the descendants of the men that had helped establish Port Gamble. William H. Talbot was reluctant to sell the company, but the early 1900s were a trying time for the lumber industry. The troubles for the company began in 1907, when the state of Washington instituted a tax increase on timber acreage held by mill companies. This, combined with inefficient operations, outdated equipment, and increasingly dilapidated facilities, became too much of a burden for William Talbot. Despite the sale of the company, Talbot devised a way to ensure that the Port Gamble Mill would remain operational. In the agreement with McCormick, Talbot specified that McCormick must build a brand new mill at Port Gamble. === Creation of Pope & Talbot Co.=== McCormick had very little success as the president and owner of the Puget Mill Company. The cost of building the new mill in Port Gamble along with the cost of modernizations and improvements being made to other mills quickly added to the company's debt. In 1938, McCormick owed over $7 million to the original owners of Puget Mill, but unable to make payments, McCormick was forced to return all of the company holdings to the principals of the foreclosure suit filed against him. The principals were all descendants of the original founders of the Puget Mill Company. By 1940 the company was running under the guidance of another descendant of the Pope family, George Pope, Sr., when it was decided that the business should be renamed Pope & Talbot Mills. The entrance of the U.S. into World War II brought plenty of business to Pope & Talbot Mills. During the entire war the mills operated at full capacity. The company's vessels were involved in transporting supplies necessary for battle to areas of conflict such as Guadalcanal and Okinawa. ==Preservation== St. Paul's church, Port Gamble, Washington Many of the buildings are well maintained historical sites. Most of the town is still owned today by the mill. There is an old church that has been restored to its original condition. The St. Paul's Episcopal Church \\"on Rainier Avenue dates from 1870. Built from the same plans used for the construction of the village church in East Machias, Maine, in 1836.\\" Many of the remnants of the colonial architecture are left behind from the settlers who had come from Maine such as Pope and Talbot. The National Park Service has cited Port Gamble as \\"the finest example of a nineteenth century Pacific Coast logging community.\\" The Port Gamble Historical Museum tells the history of the town and how the Pope and Talbot mill impacted the community. The general store was the \\"first building [that] was constructed in 1853 on the mill site, a 'rough structure' built of lumber shipped from Maine and shingled with cedar split cut nearby. Employees picked up paychecks at the office. The store sold coffee, pickles, boots, crockery, brooms, windows, toys, gloves, tools and other goods to employees, settlers, sailors, loggers, and the S'kallam tribe.\\"Olympic Property Group. Walking Tour of Historic Port Gamble: A National Historic Landmark since 1966 (Port Gamble: Olympic Property Group 2010). A general store still stands in the town, renovated to its 1916 form and now a tourist attraction. The town has an Old Mills Days festival that keeps alive the spirit of the mill. Port Gamble gives out pamphlets for a walking tour to the historic buildings. The preservation of the town of Port Gamble began in the mid-1960s, when Pope & Talbot rebuilt and restored thirty houses and buildings, located utilities underground, and installed gas street lamps. In 1966, Port Gamble was declared a National Historic Landmark. One of the oldest houses in Port Gamble that is still standing is the Thompson house, built in 1859 and owned by James A. Thompson. ==Events== The annual Old Mill Days festival takes place over the course of three days during early July and encompasses the entire downtown area. The event includes craft and food stands, a logging show, fireworks, and various other forms of entertainment. ==In popular culture== Port Gamble was the setting of and filming location for the 2010 film ZMD: Zombies of Mass Destruction. The Walker-Ames House and Port Gamble were settings for a supernatural horror film under production, Squatter. Best-selling author Gregg Olsen made Port Gamble the setting for his \\"Empty Coffin\\" series of books, which include Betrayal and Envy. Author M.M. Atkinson made Port Gamble and the Walker-Ames House the setting for her debut novel The Ghost from Nowhere. ==See also== *Ebey's Landing National Historical Reserve *Old Man House *John M.

It is located on the western shore of the Great Bend of Hood Canal, near the mouth of the Skokomish River. The town's main features are Potlatch State Park and the Cushman Dam No. 2 powerhouse, which generates hydropower electricity for Tacoma. Water from Lake Kokanee on the North Fork Skokomish River is piped to the powerhouse at Potlatch. Nearly the entire flow of the river was diverted to the Potlatch Powerhouse. A 2009 settlement will result in more water from the Cushman Hydro Project, which includes Cushman Dam No. 1 at Lake Cushman, and Dam No. 2 at Lake Kokanee, being released into the lower North Fork Skokomish River. The town's history dates to 1900, when Thomas Bordeaux became president of the newly incorporated Potlatch Commercial and Terminal Company. The company acquired timber lands and began construction of a logging railway to access them. Potlatch was built as a company town.

It follows the smuggling days of Han Solo and Chewbacca ten years before the events of the original Star Wars film. The books were released in 1979–1980, making them the first non-movie Star Wars books published, except for Splinter of the Mind's Eye (1978). They were also the last published until The Adventures of Lando Calrissian trilogy in 1983; both trilogies were originally published by Del Rey, a division of Ballantine Books. The three Han Solo books were also published as an omnibus edition in 1992. The events of the series are incorporated into the Star Wars Expanded Universe by being contextualized in interludes in Rebel Dawn (1998), the final book of Ann C. Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy. ==Works== ===Han Solo at Stars' End=== Han Solo at Stars' End is the first book of the trilogy. It was published in 1979. In UK editions of the novel, the character name Bollux was changed to Zollux, as the original name sounds like the word bollocks, which is regarded as profanity in the UK. Discovering that they need a special waiver in order to operate the Millennium Falcon within the Corporate Sector without running afoul of the authorities, Han Solo and Chewbacca attempt to get in touch with Doc, an outlaw technician. However, Doc's daughter Jessa informs them that her father has vanished, presumably abducted. Han works out a deal with Jessa: in exchange for the waiver and upgrades to the Falcon, he and Chewbacca will help out in the effort to discover what happened to Doc and other enemies of the Corporate Sector Authority, a capitalistic and authoritarian organization. As part of this effort, Han and Chewbacca escort the droid Bollux to the agricultural planet of Orron III, where they meet with Rekkon, the leader of the missing persons search. Blue Max, a small computer probe hidden away in Bollux's chest cavity, is able to infiltrate the Authority's computer network and begin searching for the location of the abductees. However, Rekkon's small group has been compromised by a traitor, and their activities are discovered. During the group's attempt to escape the planet, Chewbacca is captured by the Authority. Han and the others manage to escape the planet aboard the Falcon. During liftoff, the traitor shoots Rekkon and destroys the data that Blue Max gathered. Before dying, Rekkon is able to leave the words \\"Stars' End, Mytus VII\\" scrawled on the Falcons game table. Han realizes that this must be the location of the Authority's prison facility. Han uses this information in a canary trap to reveal the traitor, and jettisons him into hyperspace. Han and the remaining members of Rekkon's group fly to Stars' End. Masquerading as interstellar entertainers, they infiltrate the facility and rescue their friends, including Doc and Chewbacca. The facility is destroyed, along with the administrator and most of the staff, in the escape. ====Comic adaptation==== From October 1980 to February 1981, writer Archie Goodwin and artist Alfredo Alcala adapted the novel in the Star Wars newspaper comic strip. The Corporate Sector was explained to be a division of the Galactic Empire, with its ships depicted as such. In 1997, Dark Horse Comics published the comic as the colorized three-issue Classic Star Wars: Han Solo at Stars' End, collecting it as a trade paperback the same year. ===Han Solo's Revenge=== Han Solo's Revenge is the second book in the trilogy. It was originally published in 1979. Down on their luck after a botched smuggling run, Han and Chewbacca resort to accepting a job offer from an anonymous employer. However, after flying the Falcon to the planet Lur for the pickup, they discover that the cargo they're meant to be shipping are slaves—something for which neither Han nor Chewbacca has any tolerance. After dealing with the slavers' attempt to commandeer the Falcon, and still in dire need of funds, Han and Chewbacca head for the planet Bonadan, where the slavers' leader was meant to meet his contact for payment. Instead of the contact, though, they cross paths with Fiolla, an assistant auditor-general with the Corporate Sector Authority. She convinces Han that his only chance of getting paid now is to help her in tracking down the slaving ring. The slavers are watching Fiolla and are now keeping their eyes on Han and Chewbacca as well, forcing the two smugglers to split up. Chewbacca takes the Falcon, while Han and Fiolla board a cruise liner. The two parties make plans to meet on the planet Ammuud, to investigate the slavers' connection to one of the governing clans there. Han and Fiolla arrive on Ammuud and uncover the evidence Fiolla needs to implicate high-ranking Authority officials in the slaving ring. Outwitting the Authority forces who have been sent by Fiolla's superior to detain them, Han and Chewbacca are able to collect their payment at last and depart the planet safely. ===Han Solo and the Lost Legacy=== Han Solo and the Lost Legacy is the third novel in the trilogy, published in August 1980. Unlike the first two books, which introduced and largely fleshed out the Corporate Sector, in this book Han and Chewbacca's adventures take place in the Tion Hegemony. While taking a well-earned break on the planet Rudrig, Han and Chewbacca are approached by Badure, an old friend, and his female companion Hasti. Badure has a lead on the fabled Queen of Ranroon, the treasure ship of Xim the Despot, which has been believed lost for centuries. Though Han is initially reluctant to join what he considers to be a pointless treasure hunt, he and Chewbacca decide to accompany Badure on his search. Accompanying them on their quest are Skynx, an alien historian from the planet Ruuria, and Han's droid companions, Bollux and Blue Max. Han's group is not the only one on the trail of Xim the Despot's treasure. After landing on the planet Dellalt, Han and his companions are attacked and forced to abandon the Falcon. Their attackers steal the Falcon and fly her to a distant mining camp, where they intend to search her for clues to the Queen's location—by tearing the Falcon apart, if necessary. Han and the others set off on a trip overland to recover the Falcon. On their way, they are captured by a group of religious cultists, descendants of the Queen of Ranroon's crew. The cultists are determined to keep Xim's treasure safe, and are about to unleash an army of Xim's war-robots to destroy the mining camp—and the Falcon. Through the ingenuity of Bollux and Blue Max, the war-robots are stopped. Han and the others recover the Falcon and fly to the location of Xim's fabled treasure, only to find that it is not quite what they were expecting: technology and war materiel which was state- of-the-art in Xim's era, but is now commonplace, inexpensive or in some cases obsolete. Han and Chewbacca take the badly reassembled Falcon back into space, with plans to borrow money from Jabba the Hutt for an attempted Kessel Run. ==Legacy== Elements of the trilogy such as the Tion Hegemony and the world of Etti IV were variously mentioned in other Star Wars spin-off works. The events of the series, as well as that of The Adventures of Lando Calrissian, were incorporated into the timeline of the Expanded Universe by being contextualized in interludes in the final book of Ann C. Crispin's The Han Solo Trilogy, Rebel Dawn (1998), which takes place about two years before the events of the original Star Wars film. After The Walt Disney Company purchased Lucasfilm, it was announced that Expanded Universe works would be rebranded as Legends and no longer considered part of the official canon. However, the Z-95 Headhunter, which was first mentioned in Han Solo at Stars' End, has been canonized as a predecessor to the X-wing fighter in works including Star Wars: The Clone Wars. The Tion Hegemony and Etti IV were made canon in official reference material. Additionally, the skull featured on the cover of Han Solo and the Lost Legacy was included as an easter egg in the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story. ==ReferencesHan Solo at Stars' End Official CargoBay Listing * Han Solo's Revenge Official CargoBay Listing * Han Solo and the Lost Legacy Official CargoBay Listing Category:Book series introduced in 1979 Category:Star Wars Legends novels Category:Del Rey books Category:Science fiction novel trilogies Category:Space Westerns ","title":"The Han Solo Adventures"},{"id":"3241981","text":"The Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 (c.27) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which was passed to implement the Brussels Convention of 1968 into British law.

Starr of Phoenix, AZ. Both aircraft are an enclosed single engine, negative staggered, cantilevered biplane style with conventional landing gears. The fuselage is constructed of welded steel tubing with sheet metal covering. The upper wings have flaps and lower wings have ailerons. All wing air frame structures are equipped with tip plates to enhance the lift coefficient. The airplanes have a small cockpit with the rudder pedals located under the engine compartment toward the front of the cowling. The power plant is a Continental C85 4 – cylinder air-cooled horizontally opposed cylinder engine (Boxer Motor) that produces 85 hp. ==Operational history== The Bumble Bee I was flown on several occasions from January 28, 1984 – 1986 to achieve the title of “World’s Smallest”. Mr. Starr then built the Bumble Bee II. It was both smaller and lighter. He flew the Bumble Bee II on May 8, 1988 at Marana Airport just outside of Tucson, Arizona and acquired the title of World's Smallest once again. During one of the subsequent flights of the Bumble Bee II, the engine failed on downwind. The pilot Robert Starr sustained serious injuries as a result of the emergency landing. However, he recovered and the Bumble Bee II was donated to a private collection. ==Aircraft on public display== Guinness certificate The “Bumble Bee I” and the” Bumble Bee II” were designed and built specifically to acquire the title of “The World’s Smallest Piloted Airplane”. Pilot Robert Starr of Phoenix, Arizona, had been deeply involved with both previous titles holding “smallest airplane” projects. He was the co-builder and test pilot from 1953-1955 for both early record holder projects by the name of Sky Baby and JR. His partnership on these projects with Mr. Stits (co-builder) came to an end. Mr. Starr, however, had gained considerable experience and knowledge on these first airplanes during his building and test flying activities. He knew that a smaller, more aerodynamically superior plane could be built. Consequently, he decided to build a smaller machine and establish a new world record on his own. The Bumble Bee I and Bumble Bee II were the result. Why did he name them bumble bee? Rumor has it that natures’ bumble bee does not have enough wing area to fly. At first glance, most engineers and professional pilots made the same statement about the Bumble Bee airplanes. Mr. Starr flew Bumble Bee II and captured the record in 1988 at age 64.

Based on returns from parish ministers, mostly for the year 1755, he calculated Scotland's population at 1,265,380. His census did not, however, include most of the country's small Roman Catholic minority, figures for which relied on ministers reporting the number of 'papists' in their parishes. Internal evidence suggests that this was done inconsistently. A Church of Scotland congregation is led by its minister and elders. Both of these terms are also used in other Christian denominations: see Minister (Christianity) and Elder (Christianity). This article discusses the specific understanding of their roles and functions in the Scottish Church. ==Terminology== The Greek term , used in the New Testament as a designation for the leaders of the Early Church (e.g. Acts 11.30), has three different equivalents in English: elder, presbyter and priest. Priest is the oldest, a borrowing into Old English via Latin, elder (first attested 1526) is a translation of the underlying meaning of the Greek word, and presbyter (1597) is learned correction of the loan- word. However, the semantics of priest are complicated by the fact that it is traditionally used also as the translation of a different New Testament Greek word, , which refers to those who perform sacrificial rites in the Jerusalem temple and in pagan temples, but also appears as a title for Jesus (Heb 7.26). Consequently, the word priest was rejected by the reformed and puritan traditions as a term for Christian leadership, as part of the more general rejection of sacrificial elements in the Catholic understanding of the mass. Elder and presbyter remain theoretically as synonyms in Church of Scotland usage, but in practice presbyter is often reserved for those elders who are members of Presbytery, one of the higher courts of the Church. Minister comes from a Latin word meaning servant, and is also used in the Church as a verb: to minister to the needs of God's people. ==Concepts== In calling itself a Presbyterian Church, the Church of Scotland declares itself to be a Church governed by elders. Although colloquial usage in the Church distinguishes between ministers and elders, the minister is understood theologically to be an elder with a special task. The minister is styled as a \\"teaching elder\\", the other members of Kirk Session are known as \\"ruling elders\\". All elders are ordained, and the ordination of ministers is understood to be an ordinance of a similar nature to that of elders, but with a different charge. ==Role of the minister== A minister is ordained by the Presbytery to the \\"ministry of word and sacrament\\", and is regarded as being the teaching elder. A minister has the pastoral responsibility for a congregation, which he or she exercises under the supervision of the Presbytery. The minister is responsible for the conduct of public worship, and is alone authorised to administer the sacraments of Baptism and Communion. The minister is moderator of the Kirk Session, is a member of Presbytery, and on average is a member of the General Assembly once every four years. ==Selection and training of ministers== The longstanding system of ministry training has recently changed. ===Selection=== People who express interest in entering the ministry must first attend a one- day conference, at which various options (including the ministry of Word and Sacrament, the auxiliary ministry, the diaconate and other forms of church work) are outlined. Thereafter, applicants for the full-time ministry must undertake a variety of assessments, leading up to a residential two-day procedure known as an \\"Assessment Conference\\" (previously \\"Selection School\\") held at various locations around Scotland. Those who are accepted at the end of this selection procedure are recognised as candidates for the ministry. From this point on, they are under the supervision of their home presbytery, but also of the Ministries Council in the Church's offices in Edinburgh. ===Initial training=== All ministers of the Church of Scotland must have a university qualification in theology or divinity. While foreign qualifications are accepted, most candidates study for a Bachelor of Divinity (B.D.) degree at the theological colleges of the ancient universities of Scotland (St Mary's College, St Andrews, Trinity College, Glasgow, Christ's College, Aberdeen and New College, Edinburgh). In 2006 the Highland Theological College, Dingwall, was also approved as a centre for training. An increasing number of ministers are opting to take a further qualification, such as the Diploma in Pastoral Theology (Dip.P.Th.), Master of Theology (M.Th.) or Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) degree courses. The B.D. course was traditionally a three-year post- graduate degree, though mature students may be permitted to take a shorter course of studies. Since the 1980s it has also been permissible for school- leavers to go straight to theological college to do a B.D. as a first degree; in this case the course of study is longer, at least five years. The recently revised system has introduced a course with a system of four placements in congregations, replacing the former student attachments, 12 or 18 month probationary period and \\"trials for licence\\". In addition to their academic studies, they are also trained through a conference programme and through the \\"Ministries Trainling Network\\" in church law exams, public speaking, Safeguarding and pastoral care. On completing their studies, candidates were formerly \\"licensed to preach\\" by their home presbytery and became a probationer, serving a 12 or 18 month full-time probationary period in a parish. This probationary year has now been replaced by a final 15 month placement, although the objective remains very similar (albeit with more short residential training courses.) When the training has been sustained, the candidate is free to seek a charge. The Church of Scotland does not ordain ministers without simultaneously inducting them into their first charge. This is because, theologically, ministers are ordained \\"to do\\" a task rather than \\"to be\\" a minister. This stands in contrast to some other denominations which ordain their clergy on completion of training. ===Theological colleges=== Prior to Church union in 1929, the United Free Church of Scotland maintained its own colleges in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow, whilst candidates for the ministry in the Church of Scotland studied in the University Faculties of Divinity. The union of 1929 necessitated the integration of the two systems. The theological colleges now form integral academic schools at the universities of St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. The Church used to appoint the Professors of Divinity along with certain other chairs but the cost of maintaining these chairs necessitated transferring patronage to the Academic Senate or University Court of each university. Though technically still Church colleges, these are almost indistinguishable from the university schools. The Church still advises on the appointment of Professors and advises on the appointment of the Principal of the College. The Head of the School of Divinity at St Andrews is currently (2015) Professor Mark Elliot. The Principal of St Mary's College is Dr Ian Bradley and as he is an ordained Church of Scotland minister, he is entitled to use the prenominal Very Reverend whilst in office. ==Role of the elder== Memorial windows commemorating past elders of the Tron Kirk in Edinburgh A ruling elder is ordained by the minister and Kirk Session of the parish, and is answerable to the Kirk Session. Like a minister, an elder is ordained for life. Unlike members of parish councils in other denominations, elders are understood to have pastoral responsibilities, which they carry out under the guidance of the minister. Usually a parish will be divided into elders' districts, and the elders are expected to visit the church members resident in their district on a regular basis. Elders also often assist the minister in the distribution of the elements at a formal Communion Service. All elders are members of the Kirk Session. They may also be members of the higher courts of the church. Each Kirk Session appoints one of its members to attend Presbytery, and on average once every four years, one of its members might be commissioned by Presbytery to the General Assembly. Since retired ministers, theology professors and others ministers with non-parochial charges are members of Presbytery and sometimes of the Assembly, \\"equalising elders\\" are required in the higher courts of the Church to maintain the principle that ministers and elders are represented in equal numbers. Elders are eligible for appointment to any function in the higher courts, including Moderator of the Assembly. When a congregation is unable to form a Kirk Session, for example when a new congregation is first founded, so-called \\"assessor elders\\", from neighbouring Kirk Sessions, may be appointed by the Presbytery. ==See also== *Ordination of women in the Church of Scotland *Statistical Accounts of Scotland *The Form of Presbyterial Church Government Category:Christian religious occupations Category:Local Christian church officials ","title":"Ministers and elders of the Church of Scotland"},{"id":"3242007","text":"The equatorial saki (Pithecia aequatorialis), also called the red-bearded saki, is a species of saki monkey, a type of New World monkey.

The species' tail in not prehensile, relying on its arm and leg strength to carry itself from branch to branch. The equatorial saki is also sexually dimorphic. It is often confused for the monk saki, but the reddish throat and chest of the equatorial saki set it apart. == Ecology == The equatorial saki is diurnal. The species is frugivorous, but seeds and nuts constitute a large part of diet. This species also consumes leaves and insects, especially ants. The fruits that this species consumes have hard pericarps. Most of its time is spent foraging in the middle to upper levels of the rainforest canopy. They seem to be found most commonly in riverside, seasonally flooded and swamp forests, but have been seen in terra firme forests as well. The red-bearded saki moves through the forest both quadrupedally and by leaping. When the red-bearded saki takes off from a tree branch, most likely it does this from a vertical clinging position. The equatorial saki lives in small groups of two to four that come together to form larger congregations. Groups of red-bearded sakis are described as closed social units.

In 1637, he allied with the colonists and the Narragansetts against the Pequot Indians. Ninigret is credited with keeping the Niantics out of King Philip's War, in which the colonists fought to prevent their homes and settlements from being destroyed by certain Indian tribes.Frederic Denison, Westerly (Rhode Island) and Its Witnesses: For Two Hundred and Fifty Years, 1626-1876: Including Charlestown, Hopkinton, and Richmond Until Their Separate Organization, with the Principal Points of Their Subsequent History, (J.A. & R.A. Reid, Providence: 1878), pg.22 (accessed June 19, 2009) ==Biography== Ninigret was the son of Sachem Saccious, the cousin or the uncle of Miantonomo, and the uncle and brother-in-law of Harman Garrett. He was first known to the colonists as Janemo and was sachem of the Niantics, a tribe of the Narragansett people. He did not participate in the Pequot war of 1632, and he aided the colonists in the Pequot war of 1637. About a year after the death of Miantonomo, he formed a plan for expelling the colonists and sent a messenger to Long Island sachem Waiandance to engage him in it. Waiandance tied up the messenger and sent him to the fort at Saybrook. They sent him on to Hartford, but the party was forced to put in at Shelter Island, where the messenger escaped. Ninigret passed the winter of 1652-53 among the Dutch colonists in Manhattan and the western Indians. New England's colonists suspected Ninigret of plotting against them, and suspected that he was seeking stockpiles of guns and forming alliances with other well-armed Indian groups.Dr. David J Silverman, \\"Guns, empires and Indians Multilateral imperial politics triggered an indigenous arms race and led to the violent transformation of Native America\\" (Harvard University, 2016 Press) https://aeon.co/essays/how-did-the-introduction-of-guns-change-native-america Ninigret waged war against the Long Island Indians who had placed themselves under the protection of the New England colonists. In September 1654, the Connecticut colonists demanded his appearance in Hartford and the payment of tribute that had long been due from his Pequot subjects. Ninigret refused to appear and sent them a haughty answer. The Massachusetts Bay Colony then declared war against him and put 270 infantry and 40 horsemen under the command of Major Simon Willard. Willard's instructions were to go to Ninigret's quarters, demand the tribute, and insist that he end the war against the Long Island Indians. On the approach of the troops, Ninigret fled to a distant swamp and was not pursued, but the Pequots who had been under his control were transferred to Harmon Garrett to oversee.Shawn G. Wiemann, Lasting Marks: The Legacy of Robin Cassacinamon and the Survival of the Mashantucket Pequot Nation (University of New Mexico, Dissertation, 2011), p. 204 http://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&context;=hist_etds ; citing ―Simon Willard to John Winthrop, Jr., with Enclosures, 1654,‖ Winthrop Papers, 6: 458; ―Agreement of Captive Pequot Indians, Pauquatcuck, 16.8.1654,‖ WP, 6: 459-462; ―Agreement of Ninigret, 18.8.1654,‖WP, 6: 463-464; ―Order for Resettling the Pequots, with Enclosure, October 23, 1654,‖ WP, 6: 465-466;―Pequots Submitting Themselves to English Rule, October 23, 1654,‖ WP, 6: 467. On October 13, 1660, Ninigret gave Pettequamscot to the Colony of Rhode Island. He took no part in King Philip's War (1675-76) and so escaped the ruin which overtook the other tribes. His remains are said to be buried at a place near Charlestown, Rhode Island called Burying Hill. The Puritans achieved little in trying to convert the Narragansetts and Niantics to Christianity. Roger Williams recorded his discouragement about it. Thomas Mayhew asked Ninigret to allow him to preach to his tribe, and he replied: \\"Go and make the English good first.\\" ==Successors== Ninigret's daughter succeeded him as sachem. At her death, she was succeeded by her half-brother Ninigret, who granted a large portion of his people's lands to the colony of Rhode Island in 1709. This cession of land later created difficulties for the Niantics. The younger Ninigret died about 1722, leaving sons Charles Augustus and George. Charles Augustus died shortly afterward and left an infant son. Some of the tribe acknowledged the boy as their sachem, while another portion adhered to his uncle George, who assumed the entire government in 1735. George's son Thomas Ninegret became chief in 1746. He sold additional Niantic lands to the colony of Rhode Island which caused discontentment among his people, some of whom tried to depose him. They appealed for relief to Sir William Johnson, the colonial superintendent of the Indians in the Northeast (he was based in upstate New York). They made the case that the Niantic lands which Thomas Ninegret had sold were needed to support the families of men who had died serving the English king in the French and Indian War. In one letter to Johnson, they addressed the question of whether they had the authority to depose a sachem: “As it was in the power of the nation to put him in, we think it in the power of the nation to turn him out.” The controversy continued for several years, but Rhode Island ultimately obtained the lands. A small remnant of the Niantic people were still living in Rhode Island in 1812. The tribe no longer exists, but some descendants are still among the residents of New England today. ==Places named after Ninigret== Ninigret National Wildlife Refuge *Fort Ninigret *Ninigret Pond *Ninigret Park *Ninigret Beach ==Footnotes== ==Further reading== * Harold M.

The genus name Chiropotes means \\"hand-drinker\\" as they have been observed using their hands as ladles for scooping water into their mouths. This behavior is thought to be way of maintaining and protecting their magnificent beards. Depiction from 1864 ==Distribution and habitat== This critically endangered species is endemic to the far eastern Amazon in Brazil, it being restricted to a relatively small region from the Tocantins River in Pará east to around the Grajaú River in Maranhão (similar to the range of the equally threatened Kaapori capuchin). ==Anatomy and morphology== They can be identified by their thick black hair, distinctive beard that shapes the face, and a bushy fox-like tail. They can have some yellowish brown highlights around the back and shoulders. There are some gender differences as the males tend to be slightly larger than females and also have a bulging forehead. They formerly included the red-backed, brown-backed and Uta Hick's bearded saki as subspecies or taxonomically insignificant variations (in which case the 'combined' species simply was called the bearded saki), but based on colour of pelage, karyotype, and molecular analysis it has been recommended treating these as separate species.Silva Jr., J.

Universidade Federal do Pará, Brazil. ==Behavior== As an infant the monkeys can be seen using their tail to grasp things but lose the ability as the primate gets older. They are very social animals commonly grooming and playing with one another, even with those of other species and can be found in groups of around 30 individuals. The black bearded saki spends a majority of its time foraging for fruits and seeds, as well as insects. They use their strong canine teeth to crack open hard shells of fruits and nuts enabling them to access the unripened young seeds in the fruits. Bearded sakis have a gestation period of 5 months and produce one young at a time. They don't become sexually mature until 4 years old and have an expected lifespan of 18 years. ==Conservation== Just over the last few decades urbanization has brought with it highways, agriculture, and dams creating an influx in habitat fragmentation, habitat destruction and hunting pressure. Habitat fragmentation is rising as secondary roads increase and people move closer to the forests. Along with an influx of people the amount of agriculture required to support the area increases, increases pressure for deforestation. They also face a hunting problem for their bushmeat and their tails used as dusters. Habitat conservation is of top priority as this species has a particularly small range are considered the most endangered primate in the Amazon and already locally extinct in a large portion of their original range. ==References== == External links == * ARKive - Images and videos of Chiropotes satanas Category:Sakis and uakaris Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Mammals described in 1807 ","title":"Black bearded saki"},{"id":"3242035","text":"The Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1991 is an Act of Parliament made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in order to implement the Lugano Convention of 1988 into British law. ==Contracting states in 1991== In addition to the contracting states to the Brussels Convention over which the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 gave the UK courts jurisdiction, the contracting states to the Lugano Convention were the members of the European Free Trade Association who were not members of the European Economic Community (now European Union); namely Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.

The force was divided into Supernumerary Police and highly mobile Settlement Police. Members were recruited almost entirely from the Haganah. As notrim thousands of young men had their first experience of military training, which Moshe Shertok and Eliyahu Golomb cited as one of the fruits of the Haganah's policy of havlagah (restraint).Shapira, 1999, p. 250.

After World War II, the Notrim became the core of the Israeli Military Police. ==History in World War II== On 6 August 1940 Anthony Eden, the British War Secretary, informed Parliament that the Cabinet had decided to recruit Arab and Jewish units as battalions of the Royal East Kent Regiment (the \\"Buffs\\").Israeli and Penkower, 2002, pp. 112-113. At a luncheon with Chaim Weizmann on 3 September, Winston Churchill approved the large-scale recruitment of Jewish forces in Palestine and the training of their officers. A further 10,000 men (no more than 3,000 from Palestine) were to be recruited to Jewish units in the British Army for training in the United Kingdom. Faced with Field Marshal Rommel's advance in Egypt, the British government decided on 15 April 1941 that the 10,000 Jews dispersed in the single defense companies of the Buffs should be prepared for war service at the battalion level and that another 10,000 should also be mobilized along with 6,000 Supernumerary Police and 40,000 to 50,000 home guard. The plans were approved by Field Marshal John Dill. The Special Operations Executive in Cairo approved a Haganah proposal for guerilla activities in northern Palestine led by the Palmach, as part of which Yitzhak Sadeh devised \\"Plan North\\" for an armed enclave in the Carmel range from which the Yishuv could defend the region and attack Nazi communications and supply lines, if necessary.

Congresso da Sociedade Brasileira de Primatologia, Amazônia – A Última Fronteira: 21. Belém, Brazil.) is a New- World monkey, from South America. It is a species of bearded saki. == Description and physical characteristics == The Red backed bearded saki has a thick beard, especially males. It has a shock of hair on each side of its head. Its body is entirely covered with dense hair whose colour varies from red to yellowish gold. Its non-prehensile, bushy tail is almost as long as its body. Females are generally smaller than males. The latter is about 45 cm long and between 2.6 and 7.1 kg. It moves on its four legs but is able to stand upright. == Lifestyle == === Diet === Red-backed bearded sakis are primarily frugivores, feeding on seeds, flowers, nuts and fruits but their diet also includes insects, larvae and spiders. They can eat about 100 different species of plants. They have dental adaptations which allow them to crack pods easily. Red-backed bearded saki === Behaviour === Chiropotes are diurnal primates, that is to say they are active from sunrise to just before sunset. They live in groups of about forty members with both sexes, occasionally separated in clusters when travelling or looking for food, their main occupation. === Habitat === It is found North of the Amazon River and East of the Branco River, in Brazil, Venezuela and the Guianas. === Reproduction === Females give birth to one cub at a time after five months gravidity, during the rainy season. == Conservation == Red-backed bearded sakis are not considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), even if they are sometimes hunted for their meat. There are 27 red-backed bearded sakis in zoos around the world. ==Taxonomy== Skull. Previously, this and all other dark-nosed bearded sakis were included as subspecies (or taxonomically insignificant variations) of C. satanas. Based on molecular and morphological evidence, C. utahickae, C. chiropotes and C. sagulatus were split from C. satanas in 2002. C. chiropotes and C. sagulatus were the only members of the genus found north of the Amazon River, with the former west of the Branco River (a major zoogeographic barrier) and the latter east. Supporting evidence for the basic split into four species of dark-nosed bearded sakis was published in 2003, though with one significant difference compared to the earlier study: They treated the population east of the Branco River as C. chiropotes (C. sagulatus in the 2002 study) and west of the river as C. israelita (C. chiropotes in the 2002 study). The taxonomy proposed in 2003 was followed in Mammal Species of the World in 2005. In the study in 2003, a direct comparison of C. israelita and the type specimen of C. chiropotes was not included, but it is assumed that bearded sakis in Venezuela are C. israelita, while C. chiropotes is not present in that country, thereby matching what would be expected from a species pair separated by the Branco River. This is potentially problematic, as the type specimen of C. chiropotes is from Venezuela,Cabrera, A. (1961). Catílogo de los mamíferos de America del Sur. Revista del Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales Bernardino Rivadavia 4: 309-732. which could leave israelita as a junior synonym of C. chiropotes, thereby matching the taxonomy proposed in 2002. Due to this confusion, neither C. sagulatus nor C. israelita were recognized by the IUCN in 2008, which maintained all bearded sakis north of the Amazon River as C. chiropotes. However, regardless of the uncertainties over exactly what population the species name chiropotes belongs to, it is clear that there are two distinct populations of bearded sakis north of the Amazon River: A reddish-backed from the Branco River and eastward, and a brown-backed from the Branco River and westward. ==References== ==Further reading== * Peters, G.; T.

During the European early Middle Ages, the earliest text in a Finnic language is the unique thirteenth-century Birch bark letter no. 292 from Novgorod. The text was written in Cyrillic and represented a dialect of Finnic language spoken in Russian Olonets region. The earliest texts in Finland were written in Swedish or Latin during the Finnish Middle Age (ca. 1200–1523). Finnish- language literature was slowly developing from the 16th century onwards, after written Finnish was established by the Bishop and Finnish Lutheran reformer Mikael Agricola (1510–1557). He translated the New Testament into Finnish in 1548. After becoming a part of Russian Empire in early 19-th century the rise in education and nationalism promoted public interest to folklore in Finland and resulted in increase of literary activity in Finnish language. Most of the significant works of the era, written in Swedish or increasingly in Finnish, revolved around achieving or maintaining a strong Finnish identity (see Karelianism).Thousands of folk poems were collected in the Suomen kansan vanhat runot ('The Ancient Poems of the Finnish People'). The most famous poetry collection is the Kalevala, published in 1835. The first novel published in Finnish was Seven Brothers (1870) by Aleksis Kivi (1834–1872). The book Meek Heritage (1919) by Frans Eemil Sillanpää (1888–1964) made him the first Finnish Nobel Prize winner. Another notable author is Väinö Linna. Other works known worldwide include Michael the Finn and The Sultan's Renegade (known in the US as The Adventurer and The Wanderer respectively) by Mika Waltari (1908–1979). Beginning with Paavo Haavikko and Eeva-Liisa Manner, Finnish poetry in the 1950s adapted the tone and approach of T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. The most famous poet was Eino Leino. Timo K. Mukka (1944–1973) was the wild son of Finnish literature. Prominent writers of the 21st century include Mikko Rimminen and sci-fi authors Leena Krohn (Finlandia Prize 1992) and Johanna Sinisalo (Finlandia Prize 2000). ==Pre-Nineteenth century== Missale Aboense During the European early Middle Ages, what is now Finland was a sparsely populated area characterised by pre-state societies. It was gradually absorbed into the emergent states of Sweden and, to a lesser extent, Russia. There is almost no Finnish-language literature from the Middle Ages or earlier; the earliest text in a Finnic language is the unique thirteenth- century Birch bark letter no. 292 from Novgorod. The text was written in Cyrillic and represented a dialect of Finnic language spoken in Russian Olonets region. Important books such as The Bible and Code of Laws were only available in Latin, Swedish or a few other European languages such as French or German. The understanding of the medieval circulation of these non-Finnish writings in what is now Finland has been growing since the National Library of Finland digitised its medieval 'Fragmenta membranea'. Written Finnish was established by the Bishop and Finnish Lutheran reformer Mikael Agricola (1510—1557), who mainly based it on western dialects. His main works are a translation of the New Testament (completed in 1548) and a primer, Abckiria, in Finnish. The first grammar of Finnish was published by Aeschillus Petraeus in 1649, and includes eight Finnish riddles. Another major step towards developing a written vernacular literature came with the work of Cristfried Ganander, who published over 300 riddles in 1783. Until 1800, most of the literature published in Finnish was religious. ==Nineteenth century== Singers of folk poetry from Karelia, 1894 After becoming a part of Russian Empire known as the Grand Duchy of Finland in early 19-th century the rise in education and nationalism promoted public interest to folklore in Finland and resulted in increase of literary activity in Finnish language. This was characterised by an explosion in the collection and study of folklore in Finland, with a particular emphasis on Finnish-language material. Much of this material is widely thought to originate in the Middle Ages, and is often thought of in Finland as medieval literature, although this is a problematic claim.Cf. Derek Fewster, Visions of Past Glory: Nationalism and the Construction of Early Finnish History. Studia Fennica Historica 11 (Helsinki: Suomalainen Kirjallisuuden Seura, 2006). Much also came from Karelia, which also being a part of Russia contributed to creation of Finnish literature. These folklore-collecting efforts were to a large extent co-ordinated by the Finnish Literature Society, founded in 1831. Hundreds of old folk poems, stories and their like have been collected since the 1820s into a collection which is among the largest in the world. Many of these have since been published as Suomen kansan vanhat runot ('The Ancient Poems of the Finnish People'), a colossal collection consisting of 27,000 pages in 33 volumes. The prominence of folklore in nineteenth-century Finland made Finnish scholarship world-leading in that area at the time; thus for example the internationally used Aarne–Thompson classification system for folktale narratives originated in Finnish scholarship. The most famous collection of folk poetry is by far the Kalevala. Referred to as the Finnish \\"national epic\\" it is mainly credited to Elias Lönnrot, who compiled the volume. It was first published in 1835 and quickly became a symbol of Finnish nationalism. Finland was then politically controlled by Russia and had previously been part of Sweden. The Kalevala was therefore an important part of early Finnish identity. Beside the collection of lyric poems known as the Kanteletar it has been and still is a major influence on art and music, as in the case of Jean Sibelius. It is a common misconception that Lönnrot merely \\"collected\\" pre-existing poetry. It is now widely accepted that the Kalevala represents an amalgam of loosely connected source materials, freely altered by Lönnrot to present the appearance of a unified whole. The front page of Alexis Kivi's Seitsemän veljestä, 1870 The first novel published in Finnish was Seven Brothers (1870) by Aleksis Kivi (1834–1872), still generally considered to be one of the greatest of all works of Finnish literature. As in Europe and the United States, the popularity of the novel in Finland is connected to industrialisation, as are many of the first Finnish novels that deal with the life of the modern middle-class or the clash of the traditional peasants with developments such as the railway. Specifically, the theme of Seven Brothers concerns uneducated residents of the countryside and the struggle to survive under the new authority of the developing urban civilisation - a common theme in Finnish novels. Among Finland's prominent female writers in the nineteenth century was Minna Canth (1844–1897), best known for her plays Työmiehen vaimo (The Worker's Wife) and Anna Liisa. ==Twentieth century== At the end of the Grand Duchy of Finland, literature consisted largely of romance and drama, such as novel The Song of the Blood-Red Flower (1905) by Johannes Linnankoski (1869–1913), but then Finland gained its independence in 1917 and soon after a civil war broke out. As with other civil wars it was to be depicted many times in literature, as in Meek Heritage (1919) by Frans Eemil Sillanpää (1888–1964). Sillanpää was a strong leader of literature in the 1930s in Finland and was the first Finnish Nobel Prize winner. The theme was taken up by Väinö Linna (1920–1992), already phenomenally successful because of his novel The Unknown Soldier (1954). In this and other cases the very strangeness of the Finnish environment and mentality have been major obstacles to international renown. Other works known worldwide include Michael the Finn and The Sultan's Renegade (known in the US as The Adventurer and The Wanderer respectively) by Mika Waltari (1908–1979). (Sinuhe) The Egyptian (1945), partially an allegory of the Second World War but located in ancient Egypt, is his best known work. Despite containing nearly 800 pages, no other book has sold so fast in Finland and the shorter English version was atop many best-seller lists in the US. One possible reason for their international success is their focus on post-war disillusionment, a feeling shared by many at the time. Beginning with Paavo Haavikko and Eeva- Liisa Manner, Finnish poetry in the 1950s adapted the tone and level of the British and American – T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound were major influences and widely translated. Traditionally German and especially French literature have been very well known and sometimes emulated in Finland. Paradoxically the great Russian tradition might have been less known, possibly because of a political aversion. The most famous poet was Eino Leino – who in addition to his own writing was also a proficient translator of, among others, Dante. Otto Manninen was a master of meters and translated both the Iliad and Odyssey by Homer. After the wars Pentti Saarikoski might initially have been a counterpart of the beat generation, but being well educated, he translated Homer, Joyce and many important English and American writers. Timo K. Mukka (1944–1973) was the wild son of Finnish literature. During a period of less than a decade in the 1960s, Mukka sprang virtually from nowhere to produce nine novels written in a lyrical prose style. His two greatest masterpieces are the novel The Song of the Children of Sibir and the novella The Dove and the Poppy – after which he ceased writing until his early death. ==Twenty- first century== After a successful year as the Guest of Honor at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 2014, Finland was able to rebrand itself – internationally, too – as a literary country. \\"Obscurity became Finland's calling card,\\" writes Kalle Oskari Mattila in The Paris Review, noting that, \\"Finland had largely fallen off the trend of Nordic noir and crime writing, but that exclusion provided a new kind of branding opportunity: ambitious literary fiction.\\" By 2018, Finnish literary exports had more than tripled in size. Anglo American markets have surpassed Germany as the leading source of export revenue. Prominent writers of this century include Sofi Oksanen, Pajtim Statovci, Laura Lindstedt and Mikko Rimminen, noted for his irreverent portrayals of life in Helsinki and winner of the 2011 Finlandia Prize. Finnish writing has also become internationally noted for its fantasy and science fiction, having gained momentum in the late twentieth century, partly through a thriving fandom scene. Leading exponents include Leena Krohn (Finlandia Prize 1992) and Johanna Sinisalo (Finlandia Prize 2000). ==Swedish-language literature== Even after the establishment of Finnish as the primary language of administration and education, Swedish remained important in Finland. Johan Ludvig Runeberg (1804–1877) was the most famous Swedish-speaking writer of the nineteenth century. The opening poem Our Land (from The Tales of Ensign Stål) was dedicated as the national anthem as early as seventy years before Finnish independence. During the early 20th century, the Swedish-language modernism emerged in Finland as one of the most acclaimed literal movements in the history of the country. The best-known representative of the movement was Edith Södergran. The most famous Swedish-language works from Finland are probably the Moomin books by writer Tove Jansson. They are also known in comic strip or cartoon forms. Jansson was, however, only one of several Swedish- language writers for children whose work can be understood as part of a wave of innovative 1960s–70s Nordic-language children's writing; another leading Finnish exponent was Irmelin Sandman Lilius. Other prominent twentieth-century Swedish-language writers of Finland are Henrik Tikkanen and Kjell Westö, both noted for their often (semi)-autobiographical realist novels. The rise of Finnish-language fantasy and science fiction has been paralleled in Swedish, for example in the work of Johanna Holmström. ==Further reading== *ThisisFINLAND - Finnish Literature Today * George C.

He gained attention from Rolling Stone magazine, which praised his first album, Exodus, and from appearances in video games (including \\"Black Hawk Down\\", SSX 3, Burnout Revenge, Need For Speed: Underground, Total Club Manager 2004, Downhill Domination, and Enter the Matrix), movies (including The Matrix Reloaded trailer and The Italian Job) and ABC’s Alias. Hunter toured the United States, Japan and Europe with top names in the dance music business, including Tiësto in 2002, and at the Flevo festival in 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2008. He performed at Midem's opening night party in Cannes, France, an international music conference that gathered heads of industry from the music and technology world. In November 2004, Hunter performed at the Digital Entertainment Anywhere launch party in Los Angeles, hosted by Bill Gates, and presented his piece \\"Go\\" in surround sound. Hunter has been recognized as a Christian DJ, as he has been nominated for the Gospel Music Association Awards, and won a Dove Award for his album Life in 2006. He also performed a New Year's Eve (2005)/New Year's (2006) block party in Phoenix, Arizona, which was hosted by the Christ's Church of the Valley in Phoenix. In 2006 Hunter signed a new record deal with Nettwerk, which produced Exodus. At the end of the 2006 voting for DJ Magazine's Top 100 List, Andy Hunter° ended up ranked 117. Hunter also won a Dutch dance award from Seven FM in 2006. On 18 March 2008 he released his third album \\"Colour.\\" The album had 12 tracks, his longest album to date. Hunter did a series of 'video diary' podcasts during the recording of the new album. He gradually revealed some track names and on the final episode, he gave viewers very short audio snippets of each track. Hunter wrote and produced the score of the 2008 film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed with Robbie Bronnimann. Hunter completed a remix for Per Lichtman and the Beyond Belief Music Corporation (BBMC) in early June 2009. The \\"Escalation\\" remix was released exclusively at indieTorrent on 15 June 2009, with the track being promoted as only available for purchase on that site until 15 July. It was made available on more sites (including Amazon, Napster and iTunes) in January 2010. On 6 December 2010 Hunter released a new EP titled Collide, which was released as an iTunes exclusive. An artwork contest was held to choose a cover for the new EP. At the beginning of 2012, Hunter released a series of video blogs detailing the progress of his new EP, which was originally slated to be released in May. However, the new EP, Glow was released on 23 July 2012. Hunter announced that he is going to release a remix album soon. The tracks on the remix album are from his albums Glow and Collide. Hunter announced also that Robbie Bronniman will remix of his track \\"Spiral\\", featuring Beth Bullock. A few others are from Alejandro Cesar, Wicho Lopez and Mark Webb. The result was a collection of remixes that were released as two EPs in 2013: Glowing Collision Vol. 1 and 2. In the meantime, Hunter worked on a new project, Presence. This resulted in an app and an album in 2016. The app is a tool designed to inspire people to spend more intentional time with God. It contains the music, video and poetry. Every month Hunter releases a new song and video to the app. == Recognition == \\"Go\\" and \\"The Wonders of You\\" garnered placements in film and television, including uses in The Matrix Reloaded (trailer), Sky High (trailer), National Treasure (trailer), Tomb Raider 2 (trailer), Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever, The Italian Job, and ABC’s hit Alias. His work has also been featured in a handful of video games, including SSX 3, Enter The Matrix, Total Club Manager 2004, Downhill Domination, Black Hawk Down, Lumines Mobile, Need for Speed Underground, Burnout Revenge and Forza Motorsport 2. His music is also featured in the Christian video game Dance Praise. The songs \\"Come On\\", \\"Go\\", and \\"Open My Eyes\\" are included with the game. In 2007, Microsoft used \\"Go\\" in the promotional video for Silverlight as well as in 2005 for promoting their \\"Plays For Sure\\" downloads. In 2008, the song \\"Come On\\" was used in promotional advertisements for the feature film version of Speed Racer. The songs \\"Go\\" and \\"Translucent\\" were used in the Dutch sport program Studio Sport in the Champions League year view. == Discography == === Albums === * Spiritualisation (Hydro Album) (1996) * Aborigination (Hydro Album) (1998) * Cultural Shift - trip album with Martin King, vocals by Tanya Farthing (1999) * Exodus (2002) * Life (2005) * Colour (2008) * Collide (2010) * Glow (2012) * Glowing Collision (2013) * Glowing Collision v2 (2013) * Presence (2016) * Presence, Vol. 2 (2017) === Singles === * \\"Amazing\\" (12\\" and 2x12\\" promo single on Nettwerk) (2002) (including remixes by Deep Dish, Fade and Summit) * \\"Go\\" (12\\" single on Nettwerk) (2003) (remixes by Satoshi Tommie and Antillas) * \\"To Live To Love\\" (Single on EMI) (2006) (Remixes by Cedric Gervais and Andy himself) * \\"Stars\\" (Single / EP) (2008)(Including remixes by Giuseppe Ottaviani, The Camel Rider and Phonat) * \\"On Automatic / Stars (Camp America Remix)\\" (2010) By donating money for Andy walk the London Marathon * \\"Raining Sunshine (Club Mix)\\" (2011) * \\"Hold On\\" (2011) * \\"Spiral (Club Edit)\\" (2012) * \\"Morphed (Taken from the Presence Project)\\" (2014) By donating money for Compassion.

Population: 40,000 (1970). ==History== Temir-Khan-Shura in the 1900s Before 1922 Buynaksk was known as Temir-Khan-Shurá (Темир-Хан-Шура), that is, the lake or cliff of Tamerlane who is said to have camped here in 1396 after defeating Tokhtamysh during the Tokhtamysh-Timur war. It first appears in Russian annals in the 1590s when Muscovite ambassadors passed nearby on their way to Georgia. It remained a small town ruled by a Bek. In 1830 the Russians destroyed it when it sided with Kazi Mulla. In 1832 a Russian force under Klugenau camped here during Rosen's raid on Gimry. In 1834 Klugenau built a fort on the rock above the lake and it soon became the headquarters of the Apsheron Regiment and the most important Russian fort in the interior of Degestan during the Murid War. In 1849 Hadji Murad led a daring raid into the town. The place was unhealthy and Argutinsky drained the lake in 1858 to prevent the spread of disease.John F. Baddeley, \\"The Rugged Flanks of the Caucasus\\", 1940, Chapter XIII It was granted town status in 1866. In 1920, it was the center of the ephemeral Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus. On November 13, 1920, the government of the Russian SFSR declared Dagestan's autonomy during the congress of the Dagestani people, which took place in Temir-Khan-Shura. In 1922, the town was renamed Buynaksk in honor of a revolutionary Ullubiy Buynaksky. In May 1970, Buynaksk was badly damaged by an earthquake. In 1999, a car bomb outside an apartment building housing the families of military officers killed sixty-four people.The Guardian. September 5, 2010. Three Russian Soldiers Die in Blast Retrieved September 5, 2010 On August 13, 2009, Buynaksk was the site of two attacks associated with the growing violence throughout Dagestan and neighboring Chechnya. About ten men first opened fire with automatic weapons on a police post, killing four officers. The gunmen then entered a nearby sauna complex and killed seven female employees.The New York Times : 14 August 2009 : Clashes Kill Over 20 in Russia Region Retrieved September 5, 2010 Three soldiers were killed, and thirty-two were wounded, in a suicide car-bombing at a military base in the city on September 5, 2010. The driver of a Zhiguli car smashed through a gate at the base and headed for an area where soldiers were quartered in tents. Soldiers opened fire on the car before it reached the center of the base. The driver then rammed the car into a military truck, where it exploded. After the blast, a roadside bomb hit a car taking investigators to the scene, but no injuries were reported in the second explosion. However, attackers claimed killing 56 Russian soldiers by the bombing.Kavkazcentr ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, Buynaksk serves as the administrative center of Buynaksky District, even though it is not a part of it.Law #16 As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the Town of Buynaksk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.

Ivan is described as a likeable fair-haired and blue-eyed youth. The approximate setting of Ivan The Fool's adventures is the 15th or 16th century Russia. When he appears in stories, Ivan The Fool is usually portrayed as either a peasant or the son of a poor family. He is usually the youngest of three brothers, and although they appear to be much smarter than he, they are sometimes unkind to and envious of him. Unlike typical heroes, it is Ivan's simplicity and lack of guile that turn out to help him in his adventures. For example, he listens to his heart, rather than his mind, and he easily forgets offence and endeavors to help others even at his own expense. His naivety, kindness, and daring help him fight villains, make friends, win princesses' hearts, and ultimately he is rewarded with half a kingdom or some similar accomplishment. The moral of these stories is that Ivan The Fool is rarely the fool, he is merely perceived as such by others owing to his simple nature and joviality. According to one theory, Ivan the Fool as he was originally created was not intended to be a fool at all. At that time the Russian word “дурак” (fool) did not have any negative connotation, and was used to refer to the youngest son in the family. It was only later that it obtained a new meaning, from which the ambiguity arose. It is inevitably the case that he is a positive character in all tales that he is mentioned in. ==See also== *Blonde joke *Blonde stereotype *Ivan Tsarevich *Jack (hero) ==References== Category:Russian folklore characters Category:Fairy tale stock characters Category:Russian folklore Category:Fictional jesters ","title":"Ivan the Fool"},{"id":"3242075","text":"Magdalena del Mar, commonly known simply as Magdalena, is a seaside district of the Lima Province in Peru and one of the districts that comprise the city of Lima.

It was created by John F. Kennedy's signed December 14, 1961. ==Background== John F. Kennedy's administration proposed the President's Commission on the Status of Women to address people who were concerned about women's status while avoiding alienating the Kennedy administration's labor base through support of the Equal Rights Amendment. At the time, labor, which had been important to Kennedy's victory, opposed ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment believing instead that women required protective legislation—and fearing that the amendment would prevent this. While running for the presidency in 1960, John F. Kennedy had earlier approached Eleanor Roosevelt for political support. Roosevelt refused to support him, remaining loyal to Adlai Stevenson II. She had disliked Kennedy's ties to Joe McCarthy and mediocre civil rights record. After Kennedy's election, he asked Roosevelt to chair a new commission proposed by Esther Peterson, then Director of the United States Women's Bureau. Roosevelt accepted appointment to chair the President's Commission on the Status of Women. This was her last public position.A portion of a verbal presentation by Judith Nies on Book TV June 19, 2008 concerning her autobiography, The Girl I Left Behind ===Equality vs. protective legislation=== Legislation related to women in the workplace up to this time had usually taken the form of protective legislation. Protective legislation advocated gender-based workplace restrictions specifically for women on the belief that their biological differences needed to be accommodated in the workplace. Supported by many 19th and early 20th century progressives including some we would now call feminists (difference feminists), protective legislation was supposed to help working women avoid workplace injury and exploitation. However, more often, protective legislation just provided employers with the justification to avoid hiring women altogether or to not pay them the same wages as men received. If women needed so many accommodations in the workplace, it was subsequently easier and cheaper for employers to only hire men. Until the 1970s, trade unions/organized labor opposed the Equal Rights Amendment (which would have prevented laws holding different standards for men and women). ===Forming the commission=== When PCSW began in 1961, Congress began considering 412 pieces of legislation related to women's status. The PCSW's very existence gave the federal government an incentive to again consider women's rights and roles as being a serious issue worthy of political debate and public policy-making. The Kennedy administration itself publicly positioned the PCSW as a Cold War era initiative to free up women's talents for national security purposes. To win the global challenge against the Soviet Union, America needed the talents of all its citizens. Discrimination against women could mean that they were barred from important positions that they could fill. Eleanor Roosevelt, widow of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was appointed to chair the PCSW. Roosevelt chaired the PCSW until her death in 1962. No replacement was appointed, but Esther Peterson, the Executive Vice-Chair of the Commission, ran the commission until its conclusion. ==PCSW members== PCSW Commission and committee members came from professional organizations, trade unions, and religious groups, as well as presidents of colleges and the Secretaries of all the relevant executive branch agencies. An effort was made to diversify membership, although most were white. Several men served on the various committees. * Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, Chair * Dr. Richard A.

The report criticized inequalities facing the American woman in a \\"free\\" society while acknowledging the importance of women's traditional gender roles. Reflecting the then-position of labor and Kennedy's labor ties, the report avoided a flat statement about the Equal Rights Amendment. Instead, it stated that constitutional equality between men and women was essential and should be achieved through a Supreme Court decision holding that women were protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause. The Commission stated that because women were already entitled to constitutional protection against discrimination, it did not \\"now\\" endorse a constitutional amendment. However, some key members of the Commission said privately that they would support an equal rights amendment if the Court refused to extend the Fourteenth Amendment to cover women. ==Coverage of the Commission and Report== U.S. Department of Labor Women’s Bureau head Esther Peterson appeared on The Today Show to discuss commission findings and ramifications. The Associated Press ran a four-part nationwide story on the final report recommendations, and a 1965 mass-market book was published of the findings. By 1962, the creation of a national commission encouraged states and localities (cities, colleges and universities, etc.) to begin studying women's status in their areas. All fifty states had commissions in operation by 1967. In 1970 these commissions formed the Interstate Association of Commissions on the Status of Women (IACSW) and in 1975, the IACSW became the National Association of Commissions for Women (NACW) (). At that time, the NACW expanded to include city and county commissions. ==PCSW influences the creation of the National Organization for Women== The PCSW research on women's status, as well as the research conducted by state commissions, demonstrated that discrimination against women was a serious problem. In 1964, the U.S. Department of Labor began to bring members of state commissions to Washington annually to discuss best practices to combat such discrimination. At the 1966 meeting of commissions in Washington, several of the attendees began talking with each other about their frustrations with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) failure to enforce the provision barring sex discrimination in employment. Howard W. Smith (Virginia) had added \\"sex\\" into the employment provision (Title VII) of the 1964 Civil Rights Act at the request of the Virginia branch of the National Woman's Party so that white women would be protected by the Civil Rights Act. Smith, a long-time supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment, noted in his campaign literature in November 1964 that he was responsible for this amendment. The Act passed into law without additional floor debate. For the first time, the United States had a law against all sex discrimination in private employment. Because the women interested in pressuring the EEOC were not allowed to pass such a resolution at the 1966 meeting of the state commissions on women, they decided they needed to create an independent organization—an \\"NAACP for women\\" which would press for enforcement of this law and for achieving other objectives. The National Organization for Women (NOW) was founded by conference attendees in October 1966, the first new feminist organization of the \\"second wave\\" of feminism. A former EEOC commissioner, Richard Graham, was on NOW's first board as a Vice President. ==See also== * Equal Pay Act of 1963 * Civil Rights Act of 1964 * Wage gap * Economic inequality * US labor law ==References== ==Further reading== * Davis, F.

The Haganah used the force as a \\"Training Centre\\" and put as many of its members through the JSP as possible: 13,455 between its formation and the end of 1945. The British authorities provided special uniforms, guns, light trucks and some machine guns and allowed the force to control sections of land around Jewish villages and Kibbutzim.Bar-On, 2004, pp. 27-28. The JSP also provided paramilitary training to Haganah units.Rosenzweig, 1989, p. 110. The force thus expanded the assets of the Haganah and helped to provide a legal basis for much of their activities.Federal Research Division, 2004, p. 285.Gal, 1986, pp. 4-5.Tal, 2004, p. 68. One notable member of the force was Ariel Sharon who joined the JSP in 1945 and became an instructor.Karsh, 2002, p. 69.Tucker, 2001, p. 287. Another notable member was Yigal Allon. Both later served as Ministers in the Israeli government, Sharon also as Prime Minister; Allon was interim Prime Minister.

It is restricted to the northwestern tip of Panama near the border with Costa Rica, and the central and southern Pacific coast of Costa Rica, primarily in Manuel Antonio and Corcovado National Parks. It is a small monkey with an orange back and a distinctive white and black facial mask. It has an omnivorous diet, eating fruits, other plant materials, invertebrates and some small vertebrates. In turn, it has a number of predators, including raptors, cats and snakes. It lives in large groups that typically contain between 20 and 75 monkeys. It has one of the most egalitarian social structures of all monkeys. Females do not form dominance hierarchies, and males do so only at breeding season. Females become sexually mature at 2½ years, and males at 4 to 5 years. Sexually mature females leave the natal group, but males can remain with their natal group their entire life. The Central American squirrel monkey can live for more than 15 years. The Central American squirrel monkey population declined precipitously after the 1970s. This decline is believed to be caused by deforestation, hunting, and capture to be kept as pets. Efforts are underway to preserve the species. Despite the threats to the population, in 2008 the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) upgraded its conservation status from \\"endangered\\" to \\"vulnerable\\". ==Taxonomy== The Central American squirrel monkey is a member of the family Cebidae, the family of New World monkeys containing squirrel monkeys, capuchin monkeys, tamarins and marmosets. Within the family Cebidae, it is a member of the subfamily Saimiriinae, the subfamily containing squirrel monkeys. It is one of five recognized species of squirrel monkey, and the only species occurring outside South America. The Central American Squirrel Monkey is placed in genus Saimiri (Voigt, 1831) along with all the other squirrel monkey species. Among the squirrel monkeys, the Central American squirrel monkey is most closely related to the Guianan squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) and the bare-eared squirrel monkey (Saimiri ustus) and these three species form the S. sciureus species group. The binomial name Saimiri oerstedii was given by Johannes Theodor Reinhardt in honor of his fellow Danish biologist Anders Sandøe Ørsted. There are two subspecies of the Central American squirrel monkey: * Black-crowned Central American squirrel monkey, Saimiri oerstedii oerstedii * Grey-crowned Central American squirrel monkey, Saimiri oerstedii citrinellus S. o. oerstedii lives in the western Pacific portion of Panama and the Osa Peninsula area of Costa Rica (including Corcovado National Park), while S. o. citrinellus lives in the Central Pacific portion of Costa Rica. The largest estimate (most recently in 2003) is that the remaining wild population of S. o. citrinellus is only 1,300 to 1,800 individuals. ==Physical description== The Central American squirrel monkey differs in coloration from South American squirrel monkeys. While South American squirrel monkeys tend to be primarily greenish in color, the Central American species has an orange back with olive shoulders, hips and tail, and white undersides. The hands and feet are also orange. There is a black cap at the top of the head, and a black tip at the end of the tail. Males generally have lighter caps than females. The face is white with black rims around the eyes and black around the nose and mouth. Body coloration The two subspecies are similar in coloration, but differ in the shade of the cap. The northern subspecies, living in Central Pacific Costa Rica, has a lighter cap than the southern subspecies, which lives in Panama and in parts of Costa Rica near Panama. The southern subspecies also has more yellowish limbs and underparts. Adults reach a length of between , excluding tail, and a weight between . The tail is longer than the body, and between in length. As with other squirrel monkeys, there is considerable sexual dimorphism. On average, males weigh 16% more than females. Males have an average body weight of and females average . Squirrel monkeys have the largest brains of all primates relative to their body size; the Central American squirrel monkey's brain weighs about , or about 4% of its body weight. Unlike larger relatives, such as the capuchin, spider and howler monkeys, Central American squirrel monkeys do not have a fully prehensile tail, except as newborn infants, and the tail is primarily used to help with balance. ==Behavior== ===Social structure=== The Central American squirrel monkey is arboreal and diurnal, and most often moves through the trees on four legs (quadrupedal locomotion). It lives in groups containing several adult males, adult females, and juveniles. The group size tends to be smaller than that of South American squirrel monkeys, but is still larger than for many other New World monkey species. The group generally numbers between 20 and 75 monkeys, with a mean of 41 monkeys. Groups in excess of 100 sometimes occur, but these are believed to be temporary mergers of two groups. On average, groups contain about 60% more females than males. Resting on a branch The squirrel monkey groups have a home range of between 35 and 63 hectares (86 to 156 acres). Group ranges can overlap, especially in large, protected areas such as Manuel Antonio National Park. Less overlap occurs in more fragmented areas. Groups can travel between per day. Unlike some other monkey species, the group does not split into separate foraging groups during the day. Individual monkeys may separate for the main group to engage in different activities for periods of time, and thus the group may be dispersed over an area of up to three acres (1.2 hectares) at any given time. The group tends to sleep in the same trees every night for months at a time, unlike other squirrel monkeys. There are no dominance hierarchies among the females, and the females do not form coalitions. Males in the group are generally related to each other and thus tend to form strong affiliations, and only form dominance hierarchies during the breeding season. This is especially the case among males of the same age. Neither males nor females are dominant over each other, an egalitarian social system that is unique to Central American squirrel monkeys. In South American species, either the females (S. boliviensis) or males (S. sciureus) are dominant over the other sex, and both sexes form stable dominance hierarchies. Groups of Central American squirrel monkeys generally do not compete or fight with each other. Male Costa Rican squirrel monkeys are known to have very close bonds with each other. Although South American species of squirrel monkeys often travel with and feed together with capuchin monkeys, the Central American squirrel monkey only rarely associates with the white-headed capuchin. This appears to be related to the fact that the food the Central American squirrel monkey eats is distributed in smaller, more dispersed patches than that of South American squirrel monkeys. As a result of the different food distribution, associating with capuchin monkeys would impose higher foraging costs for the Central American squirrel monkey than for their South American counterparts. In addition, while male white-headed capuchins are alert to predators, they devote more attention to detecting rival males than to detecting predators, and relatively less time to detecting predators than their South American counterparts. Therefore, associating with capuchins would provide less predator detection benefits and impose higher foraging costs on the Central American squirrel monkey than on South American squirrel monkeys. An alternative explanation is that cspuchin groups are larger than squirrel monkey groups in Central America, but in South America the squirrel monkey groups are larger. In one study a slight tendency was observed in which Central American squirrel monkeys were more likely to travel near mantled howler monkeys if the howlers were vocalizing loudly within their home range, but no physical contact or obvious social interaction was observed. Variegated and red-tailed squirrels may join Central American monkey groups without eliciting a reaction from the monkeys. Certain bird species associate with the Central American squirrel monkey. The birds follow the monkeys in an attempt to prey on insects and small vertebrates that the monkeys flush out. At Corcovado National Park, bird species known to regularly follow squirrel monkeys include the double-toothed kite, the grey-headed tanager and the tawny-winged woodcreeper, but other woodcreepers and such species as motmots and trogons do so as well. This activity increases during the wet season, when arthropods are harder to find. ===Diet=== Foraging in Manuel Antonio National Park The Central American squirrel monkey is omnivorous. Its diet includes insects and insect larvae (especially grasshoppers and caterpillars), spiders, fruit, leaves, bark, flowers, and nectar. It also eats small vertebrates, including bats, birds, lizards, and tree frogs. It finds its food foraging through the lower and middle levels of the forest, typically between fifteen and thirty feet high. Two-thirds to three-quarters of each day is spent foraging for food. It has difficulty finding its desired food late in the wet season, when fewer arthropods are available. It has a unique method of capturing tent-making bats. It looks for roosting bats by looking for their tents (which are made of a folded leaf). When it finds a bat it climbs to a higher level and jumps onto the tent from above, attempting to dislodge the bat. If the fallen bat does not fly away in time, the monkey pounces on it on the ground and eats it. The Central American squirrel monkey is an important seed disperser and a pollinator of certain flowers, including the passion flower. While it is not a significant agricultural pest, it does sometimes eat corn, coffee, bananas and mangos. Other fruits eaten include cecropias, legumes, figs, palms, cerillo, quiubra, yayo flaco and wild cashew fruits. ===Communication=== The Central American squirrel monkey is noisy. It makes many squeals, whistles and chirps. It also travels through the forest noisily, disturbing vegetation as it moves through. It has four main calls, which have been described as a \\"smooth chuck\\", a \\"bent mask chuck\\", a \\"peep\\" and a \\"twitter\\". ===Predators=== Predators of the Central American squirrel monkey include birds of prey, cats and snakes. Constricting and venomous snakes both prey on squirrel monkeys. Raptors are particularly effective predators of Central American squirrel monkeys. The oldest males bear most of the responsibility for detecting predators. When a Central American squirrel monkey detects a raptor, it gives a high-pitched alarm peep and dives for cover. All other squirrel monkeys that hear the alarm call also dive for cover. The monkeys are particularly cautious about raptors, and give alarms when they detect any raptor-like object, including small airplanes and even falling branches and large leaves. Predator detection by males becomes particularly important during the period when the infants are born. Raptors spend significantly more time near the squirrel monkey troops during this period, and prey on a significant number of newborn infants. Other animals that prey on Central American squirrel monkey infants include toucans, tayras, opossums, coatis, snakes, and even spider monkeys. ==Reproduction== Two-month-old infant riding on mother's back The breeding season for the Central American squirrel monkey is in September. All females come into estrus at virtually the same time. A month or two before the breeding season begins, males become larger. This is not due to extra muscle, but to altered water balance within the male's body. This is caused by the conversion of the male hormone testosterone into estrogen; thus the more testosterone a male produces, the more he grows in advance of the breeding season. Since males within a group have not been observed fighting over access to females during the breeding season, nor attempting to force females to copulate with them, it is believed that female choice determines which males get to breed with females. Females tend to prefer the males that expand the most in advance of breeding season. This may be because the most enlarged males are generally the oldest and the most effective at detecting predators, or it may be a case of runaway intersexual selection. Males sometimes leave their group for short periods of time during the breeding season in order to try to mate with females from neighboring groups. Females are receptive to males from other groups, although resident males attempt to repel the intruders. The gestation period is six months, and the infants are born within a single week during February and March. Typically, a single infant is born. Only 50% of infants survive more than six months, largely due to predation by birds. The infant remains dependent on its mother for about one year. Females give birth every 12 months, so the prior infant becomes independent at about the same time the new infant is born. Females become sexually mature at 2½ years old, while males become sexually mature at between 4 and 5 years old. The females leave their natal group upon reaching sexual maturity, while males usually remain with their group for their entire lives. This is different from South American squirrel monkey species, where either males disperse from their natal group or both sexes disperse. Males of the same age tend to associate with each other in age cohorts. Upon reaching sexual maturity, an age cohort may choose to leave the group and attempt to oust the males from another group in order to attain increased reproductive opportunities. The lifespan of the Central American squirrel monkey in the wild is unknown, but captive specimens have been known to live more than 15 years. Other squirrel monkey species are known to be able to live more than 20 years. ==Distribution and habitat== The Central American squirrel monkey has a restricted distribution in Costa Rica and Panama. It lives only near the Pacific coast. Its range covers Central Pacific Costa Rica in the north through western Panama. It lives in two of Costa Rica's national parks—Manuel Antonio National Park and Corcovado National Park—where it can be seen by visitors, but it is not as commonly seen in these parks as the white-headed capuchin or the mantled howler monkeys. It lives in lowland forests and is restricted to secondary forests and primary forests which have been partially logged. It requires forests with abundant low and mid-level vegetation and has difficulty surviving in tall, mature, undisturbed forests that lack such vegetation. Its specialization for coastal lowland forest may explain its restricted distribution. ==Conservation status== It was once believed that the Central American squirrel monkey was just a population of a South American species of squirrel monkey brought to Central America by humans. Evidence for this theory included the very small range of the Central American squirrel monkey and the large gap from the range of any other squirrel monkey species. A study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA demonstrated that the Central American squirrel monkey is indeed a separate species that apparently diverged from the South American species long ago – at least 260,000 years ago and possibly more than 4 million years ago. A genetic study by Lynch Alfaro, et al. in 2015 estimated that the Central American squirrel monkey diverged from S. scuireus a little less than 1 million years ago. On a balcony of a hotel near Manuel Antonio National Park, Costa Rica One popular theory is that squirrel monkeys did live in Colombia during the late Miocene or Pliocene and these squirrel monkeys migrated to Central America, becoming the ancestors of the current Central American species. According to this theory, the Guatemalan black howler migrated to Central America around the same time. Passage through the isthmus of Panama later closed due to rising oceans, and eventually opened up to another wave of migration about 2 million years ago. These later migrants, ancestors to modern populations of white-headed capuchins, mantled howlers and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, out- competed the earlier migrants, leading to the small range of the Central American squirrel monkey and Guatemalan black howler. Ford suggested that high water levels during the Pleistocene not only cut off the Central American squirrel monkey from other squirrel monkeys, but was also responsible for the formation of two subspecies. Lynch Alfaro, et al. suggested that the separation of the Central American squirrel monkey from other squirrel monkeys may have resulted from a period of high aridity in northern South America. The population density has been estimated at 36 monkeys per square kilometer (93 per square mile) in Costa Rica and 130 monkeys per square kilometer (337 per square mile) in Panama. It has been estimated that the population of the Central American squirrel monkey has been reduced from about 200,000 in the 1970s to less than 5,000. This is believed to be largely due to deforestation, hunting, and capture for the pet trade. There are significant efforts within Costa Rica to try to preserve this monkey from extinction. A reforestation project within Panama tries to preserve the vanishing population of the Chiriqui Province. As of 2008, the Central American squirrel monkey is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" from a conservation standpoint by the IUCN. This is due to the fact that its range encompasses just , its range is fragmented, and it suffers from ongoing habitat loss. This assessment is an improvement from the 2003 assessment, in which the Central American squirrel monkey was listed as \\"endangered\\". ==References== ==External links== *ARKive – images and movies of the red-backed squirrel monkey (Saimiri oerstedii) * ASCOMOTI Foundation for Preservation of the Central American Squirrel Monkey (mono titi) *Infonatura *Saimiri Wildlife Category:Squirrel monkeys Squirrel Monkey, Central American Category:Mammals described in 1872 ","title":"Central American squirrel monkey"},{"id":"3242149","text":"Accounts of Chemical Research is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal published by the American Chemical Society containing overviews of basic research and applications in chemistry and biochemistry.

It is a silvery brown colour with pale streaks and russet underparts, and is very similar in appearance to the cotton-top tamarin, from which it is separated by the Atrato River. It is thought that the two species diverged during the Pleistocene, at a time when a sea occupied the area between their present ranges. This tamarin is an arboreal species, living in small family groups in the canopy. Females give birth to one to three young after a gestation period of about 140 days. This species has a relatively small range and is under threat from destruction and fragmentation of the forest in which it lives and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as \\"endangered\\". ==Taxonomy and phylogeny== Some authorities, such as Thorington (1976), posit that S. leucopus is very closely related to the cotton-top tamarin, Saguinus oedipus. Other analyses made by Hernandez-Camacho & Cooper (1976), and later Mittermeier and Coimbra-Filho in 1981, and finally Grooves (2001) This view is supported by Hanihara & Natoria's multivariate analysis of toothcomb dental morphology (1987) and by Skinner's work in 1991, which found high similarity between S. oedipus and S. leucopus in 16 out of 17 morphological traits considered. This is further supported by the transition from child to adult, during which the fur coloration changes take place and are similar between the two species. Philip Hershkovitz proposed that the divergence of the two species occurred in the Pleistocene at the height of the Atrato River, where it intersected the Cauca-Magdalena. At this time, the area was covered by a sea, which created a geographic barrier which caused this ancestral species to diverge from S. oedipus through the process of allopatric speciation. Today, the two species are principally separated by the Atrato river. ==Description== The white-footed tamarin exhibits a silvery pale brown back with lighter streaks. The front is russet colored. The tail is brown, sometimes with a white tip. Feet and hands are also white. The face is only thinly furred with white hairs. Thick brown hair is around the neck and between the ears. Its forelimbs are shorter than its hindlimbs. Its vision, auditory, and olfactory senses are very sharp. Average adult male can weigh 494 g and the average adult female is only slightly smaller, weighing 490 g. Other primates have nails on each digit but tamarins have claws on all digits except the big toe. ==Behavior== The white-footed tamarin uses scent glands to mark its territory. It lives in a group with its extended family of four to fifteen individuals. It lives in trees and is active during the day. Very agile in the trees, it uses all four limbs (quadrupedal) to aid in maneuvering through the branches. The white-footed tamarin exhibits polyandrous reproduction, meaning one female will mate with more than one male. Gestation cycle is 130–150 days. Females will give birth to one to three young and males have a role in rearing the young and carrying them on his back. Maturity is 12–18 months old. Two birthing seasons have been recorded, one between May and June and the other between October and November. ==Ecology== The white-footed tamarin lives in tropical dry forests, tropical wet forests, primary and secondary forests. It prefers the edges of forests, close to streams. Its diet consists of insects, soft fruits, and nectar, plant exudates, prey animals, and flowers. ==Status== The forests in which the white-footed tamarin lives are disappearing rapidly as the land is used for logging and mining, cleared for agriculture and for the construction of roads and dams. Populations of the tamarin are declining and some animals are sold in local markets as pets. As a result of these factors, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the animal's conservation status as being \\"endangered\\". ==References== white- footed tamarin Category:Mammals of Colombia Category:Endemic fauna of Colombia white-footed tamarin ","title":"White-footed tamarin"},{"id":"3242163","text":", also known as Karate Bullfighter, is a Japanese martial arts film made by the Toei Company in 1975.

It is divided into three vadde (village sub- divisions). These are the vadde of Vainguinn, Zoidar, and Borvonn. For administrative purposes, Panarim, a vaddo of Aldona, is also considered to be a part of Nachinola. The scenic village is mostly tucked in, away from the main road that passes through it and connects Mapusa to Aldona. ==Population== A Catholic funeral in NachinolaIn 2011, Nachinola had a population of 2725 and a literacy rate of 88.6%. Farmers at work.As of 2011, it had a population of 645 households, with a population of 2,725. Of these 1,360 were males and 1,365 females. In the age group of 0-6 years, it had 252 children, comprising 144 males and 108 females. Of its population, 2,191 were literate -- comprising 1,105 males and 1,086 females. Census of India also showed Nachinola to cover an area of 244.05 hectares. The Nachinola comunidade, or ancestral village community, is considered to be one of the twelve Brahmin comunidades of Bardez. == Church == Church of Bom Jesu at Nachinola, Bardez, GoaThe church in Nachinola was built in 1676, is dedicated to Bom Jesus, and celebrates the feasts of Santissimo Sacramento e Bom Jesus (1 January) and Sta. Ana (June). Moren De Souza SJ writes that the small church lies is tucked away to a corner and doesn't get much noticed. The reason for its naming as Bom Jesus could not be found by him.The church was initially probably known only as Jesus or the Church of Jesus, as is noticed from a sign near the left of the entry which simply says: Esta Igreja de Iesus. Subsequently, its name seem to have got changed to Bom Jesus. Franciscans were the parish priests there. The last Franciscan priest served here in 1776-77, and between 1724 and 1767, there were a total of 26 priests listed by writer Leopoldo Rocha. Inside altars. Souza quotes Clement de S. Iria as writing that the church was established in 1676 and opened for services on 26 July. when Pedro de Purificação was the head of the parish. The church was small and in 1720 had a total of only 615 parishioners. Souza presumes that with the small village being \\"squeezed\\" between Aldona and Moira, Christianity reach here around the same time as it reached the other two villages. Souza describes the inscriptions which mark the building of the church in 1676, another date from 1729, and its tricentennial in 1978. Souza describes the main and side altars with Jesus, Mary, St. John, St Sebastian, St. Anthony and Our Lady of the Rosary. A small kind of chapel is devoted to Our Lady of Piety on the left. Engineer-author José Lourenço describes its architecture as Mannerist Neo- Roman in style. It is of large size with three bays and three storeys. Its main door has a bracketed arch. The frontispiece has Rococo curves flanking a broken pediment which frames a relief of the Sacred Heart. Spear finials top the frontispiece. Twin bell towers with bausters and finials are of urn type. Earlier, Nachinola fell under the Aldona parish.< Aldona's church was set up in 1569 and Moira's in 1636; prior to this Moira was under the Mapusa church, set up in 1594. Nachinola and its neighbouring Ucassaim village have a unique relationship in participating in each other's feasts. Nachinola celebrates its Bom Jesus feast on January 1 each year, and Ucassaim celebrates the feast of Saude Saibinn (Our Lady of Good Health) on the first Sunday of February, tne the confaria (a church local body) of each village invites neighbouring confraria, parishioners and parish priest for the feast of the other. The high mass at Nachinola begins only after the team from their neighbouring village arrives. It appears that there was some connection between these two villages in the past, according to Souza. The cemetery was expanded and blessed by Goa Archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao on June 20, 1998. ==Temples== Ganapati DevasthanRavalgaddi Temple, in or en route to NachinolaAccording to Rui Gomes Pereira, prior to conversions, the area had temples devoted to Ramanatha, Malkumi (Mahalakshimi), Gram-purusha, Ravalnatha, Vetall and Gopinatha. Deities Vetall, Ramanatha, Mahalakshimi and Ravalnatha were shifted to Advalpale of Bicholim, due to religious intolerance in colonial Goa. Vetall was the main deity and the others, affiliates. There are believed to have been other deities in the temple too. The comunidade (traditional village body) consists of twelve vangors (clans). Its members, known as gaunkars, are of Brahmins ancestry. Mahajans at the Advalpale temple use the common surname Nashnodkar, tracing to their villageof origin. They belong to castes of Gaud Saraswat Brahmins, Daivadna Brahmins, ironsmiths, Marathas and Bhandaris. Earlier, according to Gomes Pereira, the village had as its gaunkars people with the surname of Porobo (Prabhu). ==Institutions== Nachinola has its own panchayat. Nachinola also has a home for the aged, called the Bom Jesus Home for the Aged. It is run by the Missionary Sisters of the Queen of the Apostles (SRA Sisters). A local youth organisation, linked to the parish, is called the Bom Jesus Parish Youth. A not so well known but important charity is situated at Nachinola. Caritas' Obra de Proteção a Mulher (OPM) one of the only two homes Goa that have been designated as specialised adoption agencies for the purpose of placing children for adoption. It is a creche for children under seven years of age and is managed by the Sisters Adorers. It is run by the Congregation of Sisters Adorers Handmaids of the Blessed Sacrament and of Charity (AASC). ==Origins of the name== One version of how the village got its name points to the belief that a talented dancer called Nola would be egged on to dance, with pleas of \\"Nach go Nola, nach go Nola\\" (Do dance, Nola). This saw it name thus grow from Nachnola to Nachinola. ==Recent changes== News reports have said that Nachinola, together with neighbouring Aldona and Moira villages are \\"wards of rich cultural history that have been attracting creative minds from across the country.\\" Past St Elizabeth Church in Uccassim, the \\"next huge house that greets you is the One School Goa, a photography and multimedia school founded by noted ad filmmaker and photographer Shantanu Sheorey.\\" It was launched around 2013 and by 2017, it had a three-year degree course (affiliated with Goa University) in photography and multimedia. It was set up away from the \\"highway and away from the tourist belt\\" in Nachinola and is run by Sheorey, who is married to actress Kimi Katkar. Students from out- of-state live in neighbouring villages. ==In the news== During the 2020 lockdown, Nachinola was in the news during the Covid pandemic, when some of its villagers took to helping those in need. In August 2020, farmers from Nachinola complained that waterlogging in their fields was destroying cultirvated crops as the drains had not been de-silted and the problem was being for two years. They had approached the Bardez Zonal Agricultural Office over this issue and sought an inspection. Village youth have also undertaken clean-up drives. ==References== ==Gallery== Category:Villages in North Goa district ","title":"Nachinola"},{"id":"3242183","text":"Dr. Gabriel Terra Leivas (August 1, 1873 – September 15, 1942) was the President of Uruguay from 1931 to 1938. == Background == Born in Montevideo to a wealthy family, he graduated from the University of Uruguay in 1895, and subsequently joined the faculty. He began his career as a member of the Colorado Party under his predecessor as president, José Batlle y Ordóñez in a number of government roles. He served as the President of the Chamber of Deputies of Uruguay from 1923 to 1924. From 1925 he was the minister for Industry and Employment. His nephew Horacio Terra Arocena served as a Senator.'Horacio Terra Arocena' Wikipedia (in Spanish), :es:Horacio Terra Arocena, His great-nephew Juan Pablo Terra served as a Deputy and a Senator. == President of Uruguay == After being selected to lead the country by the congress in 1930, he came to power in 1931. On March 1, 1931 he assumed the Presidency of the Republic for the period 1931-1938. From the beginning, he opposed the Constitution of 1918. On March 31, 1933, with the support of the police, (led by his brother-in-law, Alfredo Baldomir) the Army, and the majority sector of the National Party (led by Luis Alberto de Herrera) he brought about a coup d'etat. The Parliament was dissolved, and he disbanded the National Council of Administration, a special body set up in 1919 to provide checks and balances. This was soon followed by the total abolition of the constitution, the censorship of the press, and the merger of state powers with the presidency. He set up a government of conservative, authoritarian and illiberal character, in opposition to Batllismo and to the left. He produced a new constitution in 1934 and he put himself up for election, and was elected under a shroud of suspicion.The period opened by the coup is called the Terra Dictatorship. Particularly after 1933, Terra was tellingly closer politically to his nominal National Party (Uruguay) opponent Dr. Luis Alberto de Herrera than he was to many of his Colorado Party (Uruguay) colleagues.:es:Luis Alberto de Herrera#Participación en el golpe de Estado de Gabriel Terra Terra predominantly ruled harshly and by diktat, but continued most of the socialist reforms begun by his predecessor. During 1934 and 1935 there were many moments of political tension, with attempts at rebellion that failed, such as the Revolutionary Putsch of 1935. The main confrontation of this event was the Paso Morlan Skirmish, on February 28, 1935, which was quickly suppressed by the police forces. Paso Morlan was followed by the arrest, exile and confinement of 70 political prisoners on the Isla de Flores, including the Socialist Emilio Frugoni, nationalist Gustavo Gallinal, the batllista Luis Batlle Berres, the writer Francisco \\"Paco\\" Espinola and veterinary researcher Miguel C. Rubino. They were arrested, imprisoned or lost their public office, those university graduates who did not sign a letter expressing allegiance to Terra's regime. Many had to escape to Argentina to avoid being arrested and interned on the Isla de Flores. Another victim of the Terra Dictatorship was Doctor Julio Caesar Grauert, who was shot by police upon returning from a political event on October 26, 1933, and was left without medical attention and died of gangrene. Terra's interior minister was Alberto Demicheli, who much later was himself to become President of Uruguay as an interim measure in 1976. Demichelli's wife, Sofía Álvarez Vignoli de Demicheli, was noted for her diplomatic activity during Terra's Presidency. Terra's Vice President was Alfredo Navarro, who served from 1934 to 1938. Terra was noted for bringing into his government former opposition figures such as Martín Echegoyen, who himself later became President of Uruguay and, like Alberto Demicheli, subsequently participated prominently in the civilian-military rule which took office under Juan María Bordaberry after 1973. He broke off relations with the USSR and the Spanish Republic, while he met Roosevelt and Britain regarding his debts to them. Later he made a close friendship with Hitler and Mussolini who lent him a loan with no return to construct the Rincón del Bonete Lake Hydro Dam and Power Plant. Following his presidency, Terra became the president of Banco de la República Oriental del Uruguay from 1938 to 1939. ==See also== * Constitution of Uruguay of 1934 * Politics of Uruguay * List of political families#Uruguay ==Sources== *Geneall == References Category:People from Montevideo Category:Presidents of the Chamber of Representatives of Uruguay Category:Presidents of Uruguay Category:Uruguayan lawyers Category:Education and Culture Ministers of Uruguay Category:1873 births Category:1942 deaths Category:Colorado Party (Uruguay) politicians Category:Uruguayan anti-communists Category:Uruguayan bankers ","title":"Gabriel Terra"},{"id":"3242186","text":"Office listed by CBRE CBRE Group, Inc. is an American commercial real estate services and investment firm.

It follows Han Solo's origins and life before the events depicted in the original Star Wars trilogy. The trilogy was written by Ann C. Crispin (as A. C. Crispin), and released in June 1997, October 1997, and March 1998, respectively. The author stated that \\"Per Lucasfilm's request, I did not cover Han's time in the Imperial Academy, or his first meeting with Chewbacca\\"; these events were eventually depicted in the 2018 film Solo: A Star Wars Story. The trilogy begins 10 years before Han Solo's original appearance in Star Wars (1977), and follows the adventures of a young Han from his childhood as a pickpocketing street urchin to his days as a competitive racing pilot, up until the very moment when he approaches the table in the Mos Eisley cantina, as depicted in A New Hope. The author \\"derived the basic plot from one line\\" of Han's from the original film. The trilogy brings both The Adventures of Lando Calrissian and The Han Solo Adventures trilogies into chronological context with the Star Wars expanded universe timeline, whereas before, the time periods of these trilogies were somewhat ambiguous, being known only to have occurred sometime prior to the events of A New Hope. This is done by allowing for Solo and Calrissian to be absent from this trilogy's main story during certain periods. With the release of the three Star Wars prequel films starting in 1999, and a copious amount of Expanded Universe material, some of the stated information about minor characters of the original trilogy became inaccurate and as such necessitated a retconned explanation. For example, Boba Fett's backstory was explained as a \\"smoke screen\\" planted by Fett himself to hide his father Jango Fett's involvement in the Clone Wars. ==Books== ===The Paradise Snare=== Han Solo was born into life as a street urchin, and has spent most of his life committing confidence scams against rich citizens of the Corellia system for small-time crime lord and captain Garris Shrike.

He acquires transport to the exotic planet of Ylesia, the site of a fanatical religious colony which imports raw spice from the spice mines of Kessel and then refines it for the Jabba the Hutt's criminal syndicate. Using a false identity, he takes a job as a pilot and smuggler, putting the skills he learned committing a wide array of crimes in the Corellian system for Shrike. He discovers that religious attendees are in fact slaves, who choose to stay on the planet due to their overlords' misrepresentation of a biological oddity of their species. Han secretly records a conversation with the High Priest and plays it to help one of the slaves, the Corellian Bria Tharen, wake from her mental prison. Before they leave the planet, Han steals a number of valuable artifacts from the High Priest's collection, intending to sell them. Han and Bria convince Han's feline bodyguard Muuurgh, who has recently lost a mate who may be at another colony, to join them. The trio blows up a large spice refinery to create a diversion and liberate Muuurgh's mate. They escape to another planet, where the two felines are joined in matrimony. Han and Bria visit Corellia and meet Bria's family. Han realizes that he is falling in love with Bria, but realizes that due to his shady past, he will never be accepted by her aristocratic parents. Her mother especially dislikes his past as a pod racer under a different name. Having sold the stolen goods, Han makes plans to join the Imperial Academy on Coruscant. Unable to withdraw his funds, he must flee from stormtroopers. Bria leaves him, thinking she will stand in the way of his future at the Academy, but helps him with a loan from her father. Han, although broken-hearted, is accepted by the Academy, and he becomes the pilot he has dreamt of becoming. After graduating, his past catches up with him via an ambush by Garris Shrike, who is bounty-hunting him. Shrike is killed by another bounty hunter hoping to collect on Han, whom Han kills. The dead bounty hunter's face was disfigured, and Han swaps outfits with him, hoping this will persuade future bounty hunters of his death. He goes to Carida, the Imperial military training world. ===The Hutt Gambit=== One of the central conflicts of the story is the Battle of Nar Shaddaa, which is fought between the Galactic Empire and an alliance of smugglers and mercenaries. In the wake of an attack on Rampa II by one of the groups that would go on to form the Rebel Alliance, Emperor Palpatine instructs each sector's Moffs to end the smuggling of contraband. In response, the previously ineffectual Moff who governed Hutt Space, Sarn Shild, proclaims that he will restore law and order to Hutt Space. This announcement is met with dismay by the Hutts, and clan leader Jabba the Hutt plans to bribe Shild into sparing the Hutt homeworld, Nal Hutta. Towards this end, the Hutts pay Han, by now a smuggler and erstwhile Imperial officer, to travel to Imperial Center and bestow gifts upon Shild. However, Shild informs Han that he intends to launch an orbital bombardment campaign against Nal Hutta's moon, Nar Shaddaa, the home of millions of smugglers and their families. Shild also intends to blockade Nal Hutta until the Hutts agrees to military occupation and the presence of customs inspectors. Shild then instructs Admiral Greelanx, the commander of his sectorial fleet, to mobilise his fleet and progress to Nar Shaddaa. However, on the following day, Greelanx receives an anonymous message from Exocomm instructing him to deliberately lose the battle. As Shild's sectorial fleet assemble near Teth, Han returns to Hutt Space. The Hutts then instruct him to again attempt to bribe the Imperials, this time targeting Greelanx. He infiltrates Greelanx's flagship, Imperial Destiny, at Teth, giving him a platinum ring set with a Bothan glitterstone. In exchange for the ring and a number of valuable gemstones, Greelanx sells his battle plan to the Hutts. In the meantime, Han, along with fellow former Imperial Mako Spince, recruits the denizens of Nar Shaddaa into a loose fighting unit. Their forces are bolstered when the Hutt mercenaries, led by Captain Renthal, agrees to fight alongside the smugglers. As the smugglers begin repairing and upgrading their ships in preparation for the defense of Nar Shaddaa, Spince and Han devise a battle plan. The battle takes place as the smugglers prepare for a formation drill. The smugglers are victorious, although more than a quarter of their fleet is destroyed. Shild commits suicide after being summoned before the Emperor for his failure, and Greelanx is summarily executed by Darth Vader for treason shortly after Han returns to his ship with the remainder of his payment. Han listens in on the execution from an adjoining room. ===Rebel Dawn=== Han wins the Millennium Falcon from Lando Calrissian in an intense sabacc tournament on Bespin. He begins upgrading the freighter into a highly specialized smuggling vessel, and also makes a brief stop with Chewbacca on the Wookiee home planet of Kashyyyk, where Chewbacca gets married. Solo and Chewbacca then embark on a series of adventures that are set in interludes in this novel, but are described more fully in Brian Daley's 1979 trilogy The Han Solo Adventures. After returning to Nar Shadaa, Han is reunited with his old flame Bria Tharen. While he still has feelings for her, he is reluctant to help her an all-out attack against the slaving colonies on Ylesia. After Bria offers him appropriate compensation, however, Han takes on the mission, with help from Lando and Chewbacca. In the aftermath of the battle, Bria's troopers turn their blasters on Lando and the rest of Han's friends, confiscating all valuables in the name of the Rebel Alliance. Angered, Han threatens to kill Bria if he ever sees her again. Defaced and branded a traitor back on Nar Shaddaa, Lando refuses to believe Han was not involved in the swindle, and punches his former friend in the jaw. Desperate for money, Han and Chewbacca take a spice smuggling run from Jabba the Hutt (who has inherited his aunt's criminal empire) through the Kessel Run. However, they are met mid-Run by an Imperial patrol, and are forced to abandon their cargo in deep space while the Falcon is searched and escorted to a nearby world. When they come back to look for the cargo, however, they discover it has disappeared. Han tries to explain what happened, but Jabba — in a drug-induced haze — turns his back on Han and demands compensation for the lost spice. Meanwhile, Bria leads a rebel raid on Toprawa in which Rebel spies transmit the plans for the Death Star to Princess Leia Organa aboard the Tantive IV. Bria and her squadron are all killed in the raid, but the plans are successfully transmitted. This was intended as the \\"first victory\\" of the rebels described in the opening crawl of A New Hope, but was later superseded by the events of the 2016 film Rogue One. On Tatooine, Han tries unsuccessfully to arrange a personal meeting with Jabba, and is increasingly harassed by bounty hunters working for the crime lord. While looking for a card game in which he may be able to win the money needed to pay off Jabba, he briefly encounters Dash Rendar, a character featured prominently in Shadows of the Empire. He is interrupted by news of Bria's death, delivered by Boba Fett, who also informs Han that Greedo (whom Han later shoots at the Mos Eisley cantina) is looking for him, and may try to kill him. The following day he records a message to Bria's father passing on the news. He then proceeds to Chalmun's Cantina, where Chewbacca has just met with Obi-Wan Kenobi to discuss chartering the Falcon for passage to Alderaan. The book ends as Han sits down to a table where Obi-Wan and Luke Skywalker are waiting, which is exactly the same moment of his first on-screen appearance in A New Hope. ==ReferencesStar Wars Cargo Bay Page Category:Book series introduced in 1997 Category:1997 novels Category:1998 novels Category:1990s science fiction novels Category:Star Wars Legends novels Category:Prequel novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Space Westerns ","title":"The Han Solo Trilogy"},{"id":"3242200","text":"Cumberland is an unincorporated community in King County, Washington.

Dockton gradually transformed into the residential community it is today. As Dockton faded as an industrial center, its situation as a residential center was improved when King County bridged the portage between Maury Island and larger Vashon Island in 1918.

It is mainly known for the windmills of Kinderdijk, located near the village of Kinderdijk in the polder's northwestern part. ==History== Western border of the Alblasserwaard in 1866. Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht and Dordrecht are west of the area, on the other side of the Noord river. Alblasserdam and Papendrecht are in the Alblasserwaard. left The first human inhabitants of the Alblasserwaard settled there after the last Ice Age, around 10.000 years ago. The ice had not reached the area itself, but eolian deposits created high points in the wet environment. These high points were places where hunter-gatherers settled, as archaeological investigations in the area have shown. During the Middle Ages several canals and dikes were created to reclaim the land. The last part was endiked in the second half of the 14th century, following the permanent flooding of Woude and Donkersloot. Yet numerous floods continued to happen throughout the history of the area, as it is bound by rivers on all sides. During World War II the Bombing of Rotterdam also damaged the Alblasserwaard, when both the village center of Alblasserdam and a part of Papendrecht were hit by German bombs. It was flooded during the North Sea flood of 1953. ==Geography and population== The Alblasserwaard is bordered by rivers on all sides. To the north is the Lek, to the west runs the Noord and to the south the river Merwede. On the east side are the Merwede-Kanaal, the Linge and the Oude Zederik, together forming the boundary with Vijfheerenlanden. De village Kinderdijk, well known from its windmills, is located at the northwest corner of the Alblasserwaard, where the Noord and the Lek joins. Most of the Alblasserwaard is rural, but partially under the influence of the cities Rotterdam and Dordrecht on the borders of the area, the south and west are urbanized. The largest cities in the Alblasserwaard are Gorinchem, with 35,000 inhabitants, and Papendrecht with slightly over 30,000 people. Both are on the southern borders of the Alblasserwaard. The municipalities in the Alblasserwaard are: *Alblasserdam *Giessenlanden *Gorinchem *Hardinxveld- Giessendam *Molenwaard *Papendrecht *Sliedrecht *Zederik Zederik partly belongs to the region of Alblasserwaard and partly to the region of Vijfheerenlanden.

Most of it has been won from the water through land reclamation, using the windmills on the Kinderdijk. This process led to the area being full of dikes alongside the rivers. Most of the Alblasserwaard is grassland, where in the spring and summer one will find herds of cows, sheep and goats. The ground consists of clay. ==Nature and recreation== While large parts of the Alblasserwaard are owned by farmers, or are populated, some areas are open to the public for recreation. *The windmills of Kinderdijk are a major tourist attraction. *In the southwest of the Alblasserwaard is the Alblasserbos, an artificial forest area where deer and foxes live, as well as numerous smaller species. *Roughly between Streefkerk and Brandwijk is the area Donkse Laagten, which is under the protection of the Dutch governmental branch Staatsbosbeheer. *There are three free camping spots in the Alblasserwaard, as part of a project by Staatsbosbeheer to promote legal camping in the wild.

He was ordained a priest in December 1879 and became a bishop in January 1894. He assisted his predecessor (Bishop Francisco Mora y Borrell) as coadjutor of what was then referred to as the Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles, and became the ordinary of the diocese when Mora retired in May 1896. During his term Bishop Montgomery faced significant bigotry, but he proved to be both a capable church and civic leader. Among other contributions, he demanded that government recognize the right of parents to send their children to schools of their choice. Bishop Montgomery High School in Torrance, California is named in his honor. Bishop Montgomery was a relative of Zachariah Montgomery and aviation pioneer John J.

The end of Kent-Kangley Road, Kangley is located 4 miles east of Ravensdale, WA and 2 miles south of Selleck, WA, running from the intersection of Kent-Kangley Rd. and 346th Ave SE north to SE 263rd Place near Brown's Creek. With its roots in coal, the town formed in the late 1880s and was named for the vice president of the Northern Pacific Coal Co., John Kangley. The Kangley mine, which actually consisted of three different shafts at one time or another, was said to have produced some one of the best coal available, with only about two and a half or three percent ash whereas other mines produced coal with anywhere from 10 to 15 percent. A post office was established at Kangley on June 30, 1890. John Peterson Jr. was the first postmaster. Mail was distributed at the coal mine where Peterson worked. On October 20, 1898, the post office closed for four years. The Post Office reopened on February 28, 1903. When it reopened John Lavender was postmaster. The mail was distributed from Lavender's store. On March 4, 1910, the post office name changed to Selleck. An area near Lavender's store, in between Kangley and Selleck, was called Lavender Town. The Post Office was ultimately closed and its Zip Code 98064 was consolidated into Ravensdale, WA 98051. Coal mining operations began to curtail in 1912–1914, and being the property of the Northern Pacific Coal Co., most of the homes in Kangley were collapsed and shipped via train to Roslyn, WA. where mining operations were beginning to boom. Few original mining houses remain, primarily on SE 268th Place. One staple of later Kangley life was Truman's Country Store which was located at the corner of SE 268th St. and 348th Ave SE. The owner of the combination country store, gas station and tavern, Truman Nelson, came to Kangley in 1965 and could regularly be seen driving his golf cart up and down 346th Ave SE.

Since 2012, Dominican University College has been an affiliated college of Carleton University. Founded in 1900 and granted a civil university charter in 1967, Dominican University College is modeled on the houses of studies of the Order of Preachers and was originally the center of graduate studies for Canadian Dominicans. Today, Dominican offers civil and pontifical bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in philosophy and theology. ==History== The Saint-Jean-Baptiste church was completed in November 1872 at the corner of Primrose and Victoria Avenue (now Empress) in Ottawa. The adjoining Dominican convent and house of studies opened in 1899, modeled after the medieval studium generale specializing in Philosophy and Theology. In 1900, the Dominicans brought their School of Theology to Ottawa, followed shortly thereafter by studies in Philosophy in 1902, and granted ecclesiastical degrees at the level of licentiate. The first regent of the university, from 1900-1920, was Raymond-Marie Rouleau, who would later become archbishop of Quebec and then a Cardinal. In 1930, the Institut d'Etudes Medievales d'Ottawa was established at the convent as the French speaking equivalent to the Institute of Mediaeval Studies at St. Michael's College of the University of Toronto founded in 1929. Étienne Gilson and Marie-Dominique Chenu were instrumental in the founding of the institute, which relocated to the Université de Montréal in 1942. On February 8, 1931, fire destroyed the original Saint-Jean-Baptiste church and portions of the convent. The rebuilt church and convent which remain today were opened on Easter 1932. In 1967, a civil charter was granted to the Collège dominicain de philosophie et de théologie by the Ontario Government, allowing the college to offer civil university degrees in philosophy and theology. The first Doctorate in Theology from Dominican College was granted in 1971. In 1974 Dominican College joined the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada. The university opened its undergraduate and graduate programs in Philosophy to English speaking students in 1992 and 1997 respectively, and established English undergraduate and graduate programs in Theology in 2003 and 2007. Today the building houses the Dominican Monastery and the Dominican University College, which offers undergraduate and graduate studies in philosophy and theology. The building has several architecturally interesting and historically significant features, including cloister vault ceilings, stained glass by Guido Nincheri, and a Casavant Frères organ. ==Research== The Faculty of Philosophy at DUC specializes in the history of philosophy, modern European philosophy and Aristotelian-Thomistic metaphysics. Faculty members come from both the analytic and continental traditions. The Faculty of Theology has strengths in New Testament hermeneutics and value personalism. View of St-Jean-Baptiste Church from the inner garden ===Science et Esprit=== Since 1998, DUC has been the home of the journal Science et Esprit. First established in 1948 under the name Sciences Ecclésiastiques by professors in the Faculty of the Society of Jesus in Montreal, the journal specializes in philosophy and theology, and publishes articles in both English and French. ==Student Association== The Association Étudiants Collège Dominicain (AECDO) elects representatives to sit on the boards for both the Faculty of Philosophy and of the Faculty of Theology.

The technique aims to eliminate fixed costs of production and reduce the amount of materials used. ==Uses== Anything that is produced using traditional printing techniques is a candidate for ink jet material deposition. In addition, the precision available with ink jet technology may be required for some industrial applications. Examples include: * Organic light-emitting diode display production. * Printed circuit boards are typically produced using screen printing, which is not cost-effective for prototyping or small production runs. Conductive ink can be used to create circuit traces. ==Advantages== * Since the underlying technology is digital, startup costs of production are relatively low. Each copy produced may be different from the last. * Expensive materials may be used more efficiently; no material is wasted by placing it where it doesn't need to go. ==Disadvantages== * The material to be jetted must be compatible with the print head used and must have its viscosity within a specific range. ==See also== * Inkjet technology ==Further reading== * Category:Inkjet printers ","title":"Ink jet material deposition"},{"id":"3242267","text":"Klahanie is a planned community in Sammamish, Washington, United States. The population was 10,674 at the 2010 census. Prior to its annexation by the city of Sammamish in 2016, Klahanie was a census-designated place (CDP) in unincorporated King County. Klahanie is home to many different neighborhoods inside its boundaries, such as Heatherwood and The Willows. There are two schools in Klahanie, Beaver Lake Middle School and Challenger Elementary School, both in the Issaquah School District. There are two community pools, tennis courts, basketball courts, and parks. ==Etymology== The word \\"Klahanie\\" is a Chinook Jargon term for \\"outside\\" or \\"the outdoors\\". The name was originally considered in the 1970s for a proposed development in southern Snohomish County at the location of modern-day Mill Creek. ==History== Klahanie opened in 1985 as one of the first planned communities in the Pacific Northwest. The , 3,200-home community was planned with small yards to complement large communal open spaces. The last of the development's homes were finished in 1994. Klahanie is located between the cities of Issaquah and Sammamish and its annexation became a point of conflict between the two cities in the 1990s and 2000s. The government of King County mandated that Klahanie accept incorporation into either city in the early 2000s, leading to the community weighing its options. In November 2005, the area voted to be annexed into Issaquah, but voted against taking on a portion of the city's debt. In July 2006, Issaquah decided to shelve its plan to annex Klahanie to avoid paying $17 million in road improvements for Issaquah-Fall City Road. A second election was held in February 2014 for Klahanie residents to accept an annexation by Issaquah, after a proposal for the two cities to split the area failed. The proposition failed by 32 votes, leading to the city transferring its annexation rights to Sammamish in June. The city of Sammamish organized an annexation ballot measure for April 2015 that passed with 87 percent approval. The annexation took effect on January 1, 2016, increasing the estimated population of Sammamish from 49,980 to 61,250. ==Geography== Klahanie is located at (47.570970, -122.008391), approximately north of downtown Issaquah and east of Seattle. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 1.942 square miles (5.03 km2), of which, 1.926 square miles (4.988 km2) of it is land and 0.016 square miles (0.041 km2) of it (0.82%) is water. ==Demographics== As of the 2010 census, there were 10,674 people, 3,806 households, and 3,009 families residing in the Klahanie CDP. The population density was 5,500 people per square mile (2,100/km2). There were 3,915 housing units at an average density of 2,016/sq mi (778/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 68.9% White, 1.3% African American, 0.2% Native American, 23.9% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 1.3% from other races, and 4.3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.2% of the population. There were 3,009 households, out of which 49.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.8% were married couples living together, 3.4% had a male householder with no wife present, 8.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.9% were non-families. 17.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 3.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.8 persons and the average family size was 3.19 persons. In the Klahanie community, 31.1% of the population were under the age of 18, 3.4% from 20 to 24, 30.9% from 25 to 44, 27.7% from 45 to 64, and 4.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35.8 years. According to the 2015 American Community Survey, the median income for a household in the Klahanie CDP was $127,589. ==Transportation== The Klahanie area is served by two main highways: Issaquah Pine Lake Road and Issaquah-Fall City Road, which both continue south towards Downtown Issaquah and Issaquah Highlands; the roads also continue north towards Sammamish and east towards Fall City, respectively. The neighborhood is served by King County Metro service on routes 216, 219 and 269, connecting the area to Sammamish, Redmond, Issaquah and Downtown Seattle. King County Metro also operates two carpool/vanpool park and rides in Klahanie. The neighborhood was bypassed by Metro bus service because of its low densities in the early 1990s, despite the construction of bus turnouts and other infrastructure in anticipation of service. ==References== ==External links== *Klahanie Community Website *Klahanie Neighborhood Group Category:Census-designated places in King County, Washington Category:Planned communities in Washington (state) ","title":"Klahanie, Washington"},{"id":"3242270","text":"is a Japanese martial arts film made by Toei Company in 1975 and directed by Kazuhiko Yamaguchi.

A dashing right-handed batsman, Holmes believed that cricket was to be enjoyed and was an important figure in restoring the reputation of English cricket after the Bodyline controversy of the early 1930s. He succeeded the Bodyline captain Douglas Jardine as captain of Surrey in 1934 and resolutely refused to use short-pitched bowling in county matches. He also captained the \\"goodwill\\" Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) non-Test tour to Australia and New Zealand in 1935–36. ==Schools== Holmes attended Park View School in South Godstone, Surrey, and St Andrew's School, Eastbourne, before going to Malvern College in Worcestershire in 1919, where he was coached at cricket by Charles Toppin.Errol Holmes, Flannelled Foolishness, Hollis & Carter, London, 1957, pp. 6–12. In a school match in 1922 he took 10 for 36 in an innings.Holmes, pp. 14–15. He captained the First XI in 1923 and 1924.Holmes, pp. 16–17. He first played for Surrey in 1924 before going up to Trinity College, Oxford. ==Oxford== Holmes came to prominence as a hard-hitting batsman for Oxford University from 1925 to 1927, also playing a few matches for Surrey and for the Gentlemen against the Players. He also bowled fast-medium, though it was reported that his run-up tended to be rather more fearsome than the bowling that resulted from it. He gained blues in football and cricket in his first year. At a time when, he said, it was \\"desirable but by no means essential\\" for an Oxbridge student to finish with a degree,Holmes, p. 24. he approached his studies light-heartedly and did not sit for his exams in his final year, preferring to concentrate on his captaincy of the Oxford cricket team.Holmes, p. 27. He scored a century in the match against Cambridge, but Oxford lost. In the match against Free Foresters a few weeks earlier he had scored 236, including four sixes off four balls, and declared at the end of the first day when Oxford had made 520 for 8. During the General Strike of 1926 he served as a postman, delivering mail in his Darracq to the villages around Oxford.Holmes, p. 25. He toured Jamaica in February and March 1927 in a team captained by the Hon. L. H. Tennyson that played three first-class matches against Jamaica. ==Business and cricket career== After Oxford, Holmes left first-class cricket to work on the Stock Exchange. He worked for several companies in London, and also spent six months in 1930 at the New York Stock Exchange. He played only a few first-class matches in 1928 and 1929, and none from then until 1934, when H. D. G. Leveson Gower, who was President of Surrey, accosted him in Throgmorton Street and in the course of conversation asked him to take over the county's captaincy.Holmes, p. 31–40. He was an instant success, making 1,000 runs in each of the next four seasons and being appointed vice-captain on the MCC tour of the West Indies in 1934–35, where he played in all four Test matches. He made his highest Test score of 85 not out in the Second Test, going to the wicket at 95 for 6 and seeing the score through to 258 all out. He had to take over the captaincy midway through the Fourth Test after the captain, Bob Wyatt, had his jaw broken by a fast ball from Manny Martindale.Holmes, pp. 67–89. He also played one Test at Lord's in the 1935 series against South Africa, and was chosen to lead the non-Test tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1935–36. Business commitments led him to make himself unavailable for the 1936–37 tour to Australia under Gubby Allen, and he retired from the Surrey captaincy to resume his business career after the 1938 season. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1936. ==War service== During World War II, he was an officer in the Royal Artillery, achieving the rank of Major. He was described as a \\"flak expert\\". He flew as British flak liaison officer with the first American bomber mission against the German naval base at Wilhelmshaven. When the waist gunner of his aircraft was injured, Holmes took his place, but did not have any opportunity to fire the weapon.\\"Britain at War: Two Big Day Raids on Nazi Sea Bases\\", The Daily Telegraph, page 24, 28 January 2013 (reprint of article first published on 28 January 1943). He was awarded the US DFC in 1948 for his services during the war, having been the flak liaison officer with the 1st Bomb Wing/Division during all their operations over Europe.Save The Brampton Grange Retrieved 28 January 2013. ==Later career== After the war, Holmes was persuaded back to Surrey as captain for two further seasons from 1947, and as late as 1955, at the age of 49, he came back to captain Surrey in one match against Oxford University, batting at number nine and scoring 49 runs. In retirement, he sat on MCC and Surrey committees. He published his autobiography, Flannelled Foolishness: A Cricketing Chronicle, in 1957.Wisden 1958, pp. 1015–16. He died in hospital in August 1960 after a heart attack.Wisden 1961, p. 947. Sir Jack Hobbs, who played alongside him and served with him on the Surrey committee, wrote that Holmes \\"was a true sportsman and a lovable fellow\\", \\"a fine attacking batsman\\" who \\"set a fine personal example in the field\\" and \\"would not tolerate anything shady or underhanded\\".Wisden 1961, p. 948. ==References== ==External links== * Errol Holmes profile, Cricinfo : \\"one of the greatest cricketers Malvern has ever produced\\" * Errol Holmes, Cricket Archive Category:1905 births Category:1960 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:England Test cricketers Category:People educated at Malvern College Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Oxford Category:Oxford University cricketers Category:Surrey cricketers Category:Surrey cricket captains Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:Free Foresters cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:Gentlemen cricketers Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:Royal Artillery officers Category:English cricket administrators Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:Harlequins cricketers Category:Gentlemen of England cricketers Category:English stockbrokers Category:L.

It is divided among three separate congregations. The original community of the institute is headquartered in Monroe, Michigan. The Motherhouse currently houses more than 200 sisters, more than 100 of whom require supportive care. The sisters originally began as teachers, but their ministries have become more diverse, including: Education in grade schools, high schools, colleges and universities, pastoral care in hospitals, long-term care facilities and other health care settings, parish ministry and outreach into poor communities and individuals in need, social services for poor and homeless families, working with those with AIDS, providing spiritual direction and retreats, advocacy efforts to help people get the resources needed to fully participate in society, programs and services for older adults in a variety of settings, and work to improve the environment. ==History== The main campus seen from West Elm Street in Monroe The north building on campus as seen up close The beginnings of the institute came about in 1845 shortly after Father Louis Florent Gillet, C.Ss.R., arrived in Monroe, Michigan, to become the pastor of St. Mary Parish. On November 10, Gillet and Theresa Maxis Duchemin, a member of the Oblate Sisters of Providence in Baltimore, established the institute in Monroe.\\"Our Co-Founders: Louis Florent Gillet and Theresa Maxis\\" Accessed June 2, 2010. Father Gillet found that Monroe had no school for the daughters of the descendants of French Canadians, most of whom were Catholic. He petitioned the local bishop, Peter Paul Lefevere, coadjutor bishop of Detroit, for a religious institute to assume teaching duties. The bishop declined, so Gillet invited three women to form a new religious congregation, which would become known as the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. The co-foundress and first religious superior of the Monroe community was Mother Theresa Maxis Duchemin, one of the first members of Oblate Sisters of Providence, the first religious congregation established in the country for women of African descent. On January 15, 1846, the first St. Mary Academy opened with 40 students. In 1858, a mission was established to serve the German-speaking Catholic children of Pennsylvania at the request of the Bishop of Philadelphia, the now-sainted John Neumann.\\"IHM: History\\" Accessed October 11, 2010. As a result of this mission, a dispute broke out between the bishops of Detroit and Philadelphia regarding their jurisdiction over the Sisters. Mother Theresa was faulted by Bishop Lefevre for this and was removed from her office of Superior General. She was then sent to the mission in Pennsylvania. Shortly after this, in 1859, the Sisters in that state separated from the community in Michigan and were established as an independent congregation under the Bishop of Philadelphia. This congregation later further split into two more, one based in Scranton, Pennsylvania (founded in 1871), and the other in Chester County, Pennsylvania. In 1920, St. Mary Academy and College had outgrown its facilities and the institute made plans to construct a new college facility. The Sisters initially planned to build the new campus in Monroe, but Bishop Michael Gallagher invited them to build in nearby Detroit. In Detroit the college would have a larger field of influence and offer a Catholic higher education to thousands of young women who might otherwise not have such an opportunity. The Sisters built their new college in Detroit and named it Marygrove College. Photograph of the late stages of the fireOn June 3, 1929, St. Mary Academy in Monroe was destroyed by fire. This caused extreme difficulties for the IHM institute, as they were burdened with heavy debts from the building of Marygrove College and the cost of rebuilding the motherhouse and academy in Monroe was prohibitive. Additionally, the Great Depression of 1929 began soon afterward, which only added to their financial woes. Nevertheless, the institute finished the reconstruction and moved into their new facilities in 1932. The congregation went on to establish Marian and Immaculata high schools in the Detroit area and Immaculate Heart of Mary High School in Westchester, Illinois. In 1948, the Michigan congregation began its first missionary work outside the continental United States when the Sisters opened a mission in Cayey, Puerto Rico. In 2008, the Sisters opened Detroit Cristo Rey High School and co-sponsor it with the Congregation of St. Basil.\\"About Detroit Cristo Rey High School\\" Accessed June 2, 2010. ==Educational institutions== ===Schools=== *Detroit Cristo Rey High School, Detroit, Michigan (co-sponsored) *Our Lady of Guadalupe Middle School, Detroit, Michigan (co-sponsored) *Our Lady of Lourdes Academy, Miami, Florida *Villa Maria Academy, Immaculata (Lower School) & Malvern (high school), Pennsylvania *Colegio Villa Maria Miraflores, Lima, Perú *Colegio Villa Maria La Planicie, Lima, Peru *Colegio Inmaculado Corazón, Lima, Peru *Villa Maria Academy (founded in 1940), Santiago de Chile, Chile *Marian High School, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan *Colegio San Antonio, Bellavista, Peru, (founded on 1928) *Epiphany Catholic School, Miami, FL Defunct *Girls Catholic Central High School, Detroit, Michigan *Hall of the Divine Child, Monroe, Michigan *Immaculata High School, Detroit, Michigan *Immaculate Heart of Mary High School, Westchester, Illinois (absorbed by St. Joseph High) *St. Mary's Academy, Monroe, Michigan (merged with Monroe Catholic Central High to form St. Mary Catholic Central High School) ===Colleges and universities=== *Immaculata University, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania *Marygrove College, Detroit, Michigan CLOSED *Marywood University, Scranton, Pennsylvania ==In the arts== In 2012, the Monroe campus was used for filming numerous scenes of Arnaud Desplechin's movie Jimmy P: Psychotherapy of a Plains Indian (2013), which was entered in the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, depicting the now vanished Winter Veteran Hospital of Topeka, Kansas. ‘AKA Jimmy Picard’, starring Benicio Del Toro, begins filming in Monroe, Michigan on www.onlocationvacations.com 2012-06-19. ==References== ==External links== *The IHM Sisters in Monroe, Michigan Category:Catholic female orders and societies Category:Catholic educational institutions Category:Monroe, Michigan Category:Buildings and structures in Monroe County, Michigan Category:Religious organizations established in 1845 Category:1845 establishments in Michigan ","title":"Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary"},{"id":"3242285","text":"Peter Redpath (August 1, 1821 - February 1, 1894) was a Canadian businessman and philanthropist, closely associated with Redpath Sugar. ==Biography== Redpath was born in Montreal, Lower Canada, the son of a Scottish immigrant, John Redpath, a director of the Bank of Montreal and a member of the Montreal City Council.

From 1962, he was a member of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers, and in 1968 he was one of the first two acting chairmen of the Council of Ministers. Neumann played an important role in the initiation and implementation of the New Economic System (\\"Neues Ökonomisches System\\"; NÖS). In the wake of Erich Honecker's removal of Walter Ulbricht in 1971, Neumann, as the only important Politburo member from that time, refused to go along with underwriting a secret request to the Soviet leadership for Ulbricht's redemption, since he was on Ulbricht's side on content and conceptual issues. Erich Honecker would never forget this. Neumann was until the end an uncomfortable antagonist to Honecker, but this was never used in public against him. ===Downfall=== In 1989, in East Germany's dying days, Neumann went back to join the Council of Ministers and was excluded from the Politburo. He was also excluded from the SED/PDS in 1990. From 1992 he faced accusations of \\"manslaughter and bodily harm on the inter-German border\\" for his membership in the East German National Defence Council (\\"Nationaler Verteidigungsrat der DDR\\"). The 23rd Penal Chamber of the Berlin State Court, however, stayed proceedings in 1999 without ever arranging a trial. Neumann received in 1956 and 1964 the Fatherland Order of Merit and in 1984 the Order of Karl Marx. == Literature == * \\"Arbeit für den Sozialismus\\", selected speeches, Berlin 1979 * \\"Die DDR stärken - den Frieden sichern\\", selected speeches, Berlin 1984 *S.

Cunningham founded YWAM in Lausanne, Switzerland in 1960 with his wife, Darlene Cunningham, at the age of 24. They reside in Kona, Hawaii and are members of the YWAM Global Leadership Team. __TOC__ ==Early life== Loren Cunningham was born on June 30, 1935, in the oil boom town of Taft, California. His parents, Tom and Jewell (Nicholson) Cunningham, were itinerant Assembly of God pastors who moved their children, Phyllis, Loren and Janice, with them as they planted churches across the Southwest. Cunningham's maternal grandparents were traveling evangelists who planted churches in Arkansas, Texas and Oklahoma, and his paternal grandfather was an itinerant Bible teacher known as \\"the walking Bible\\". Cunningham received his own missionary call at the age of 13 at a Monday night youth rally in Fayetteville, Arkansas. He attended high school in West Los Angeles at University High and graduated in December 1952. The following year marked his first missions outreach – an Easter break trip to Mexico with 11 other youth. He took a year of courses at Santa Monica City College and the University of California, Los Angeles, before moving on to Central Bible Institute and Seminary in Springfield, Missouri, a school affiliated with the Assemblies of God. At CBIS, Loren served as student body president and also joined a singing quartet called The King's Magnifiers. ==Ministry== ===Youth with a Mission=== While traveling in the Bahamas in 1956 as part of a gospel quartet, Cunningham claims to have experienced a vision. In this vision, he described waves on the shorelines of the continents on a world map, eventually growing bigger and bigger, covering the landmass. He records that the waves in this vision changed to young people covering the continents, talking to people about their faith. This vision would inspire the beginning of Youth with a Mission four years later as a movement providing missionary opportunities for Christian youth after high school, regardless of their denomination. He and his wife continue to have influence on the leadership of YWAM International, holding the title of Founders of the Mission. They are members of the YWAM Global Leadership Team and advisers to the Team 3 leadership of YWAM International. ===University of Nations=== In 1978, Cunnigham co-founded the University of the Nations in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii with Howard Malmstadt. He served as the university's president until 2010. ==Bibliography== * * (first published under the title Winning God's Way) * * * ==See also== *David Loren Cunningham – Loren and Darlene's son ==References== ==External links== * University of the Nations International homepage * Recordings of Loren teaching can be downloaded from the YWAM Podcast site at http://ywampodcast.org Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:American evangelicals Category:Christians from California Category:People from Maricopa, California Category:University High School (Los Angeles) alumni ","title":"Loren Cunningham"},{"id":"3242305","text":"Antoniano may refer to: * Antoniano (name) * CA Antoniano, a Spanish football team based in Lebrija, Province of Seville * Institute of Antoniano, an educational and charitable institution in Bologna, Italy ==See also== * Piccolo Coro dell'Antoniano, children's choir in Bologna, Italy * * Antoniana (disambiguation) * Antonino (disambiguation) ","title":"Antoniano"},{"id":"3242308","text":"The letters IHM may refer to: * Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, US Catholic religious order * Institute of Healthcare Management, UK ","title":"IHM"},{"id":"3242313","text":"Laurent Jean-Pierre Mbariko (January 19, 1925 – December 30, 1972), from the Kwilu region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, was a prominent Congolese politician who played a significant role in Congo's independence from Belgium. After elementary schooling in Catholic missionary schools, he followed a fast- track training for teachers. After teaching in the Kwilu, he moved to Leopoldville, the capital, in the late 1940s.

Kane was born in Heywood, Lancashire, on 28 February 1918, but grew up in the town of Golborne, Lancashire, after his family moved there before his first birthday. In Golborne Peter Kane Square is named in his honour.Photograph, Geograph.org. ==Boxing style== He was a two- fisted fighter, renowned for his punching power. Fifty-three of his eighty- eight wins were by knockout. ==Professional career== He made his professional debut in December 1934, at the age of sixteen. He fought and beat Joe Jacobs in Liverpool, where he was to have many of his fights. The fight was stopped in the fifth. He went on to record a string of forty-one consecutive wins, before challenging Benny Lynch for the World flyweight title, at the age of nineteen. The fight, in October 1937, was staged at Shawfield Park, Glasgow in front of a crowd of over 40,000. Lynch retained his title by knocking Kane out in the thirteenth round. Kane had a re-match with Lynch in March 1938, and fought a draw over fifteen rounds in Liverpool. Lynch could not make the flyweight limit and had to pay a forfeit. In his next fight, against the American Jackie Jurich, Lynch was again overweight despite winning the fight and forfeited his World flyweight title. The British Boxing Board of Control declared the title vacant. ==World title== Jurich and Kane were regarded as the chief contenders for the vacant world flyweight title, and a fight was arranged between them in September 1938, in Liverpool. Kane won on points after putting Jurich down five times during the fight. He was now world flyweight champion, but he was finding it increasingly difficult to get down to the flyweight limit. In 1939, Kane announced that he was going to fight as a bantamweight in future, and at the end of that year, the National Boxing Association of America stripped him of his title. He continued to be recognised as world flyweight champion by the International Boxing Union, in Europe. Kane continued to fight recording a string of victories with only the occasional defeat, but most of his fights were at bantamweight. Although he was the world flyweight champion, the British and Commonwealth titles were held by the Scotsman Jackie Paterson. In June 1943, a fight was arranged at Hampden Park, Glasgow, with all three titles at stake. Kane managed to make the flyweight limit for the fight but was knocked out in the first round. The fight lasted 61 seconds. ==Subsequent career== Kane continued to fight but concentrated on the bantamweight division from now on, again winning most of his fights. In September 1947, he fought the Frenchman Theo Medina for the European bantamweight title, at Belle Vue, Manchester. Kane won on points to become European bantamweight champion. In December 1947, he defended the title against the Belgian Joe Cornelis, again at Belle Vue, and again won on points. In February 1948, he defended his European title against the Italian Guido Ferracin, again at Belle Vue, and this time lost on points. He had a re-match with Ferracin in July 1948, at Belle Vue again. This time Kane was forced to retire in round five. He had only three more fights, losing on points to Stan Rowan in November 1948 and to Arthur Garrett in January 1950, and knocking out Johnny Conn, who was making his debut, in April 1951. ==Retirement== He worked throughout his career as a blacksmith in the village of Lowton, which neighbours Golborne. Throughout his adult life and boxing career, he lived on Lowton Road, Golborne, the main road between Lowton and Golborne. He died on 23 July 1991, aged 73. ==See also== *List of flyweight boxing champions ==References== ==External links== * Maurice Golesworthy, Encyclopaedia of Boxing (Eighth Edition) (1988), Robert Hale Limited, *My Most Thrilling Fights and Lessons I Learned (1937) Peter Kane article. * *Peter Kane - CBZ Profile Category:1918 births Category:1991 deaths Category:People from Heywood, Greater Manchester Category:English male boxers Category:Flyweight boxers Category:World boxing champions Category:World flyweight boxing champions Category:World Boxing Association champions Category:People from Golborne Category:Place of death missing ","title":"Peter Kane"},{"id":"3242321","text":"James FitzMaurice FitzGerald (died 18 August 1579) was a member of the 16th century ruling Geraldine dynasty in the province of Munster in Ireland. He rebelled against the crown authority of Queen Elizabeth I of England in response to the onset of the Tudor conquest of Ireland. He led the first of the Desmond Rebellions in 1569, spent a period in exile in continental Europe, but returned with an invasion force in 1579. He died shortly after landing. ==Early life== FitzMaurice was son of Maurice Fitzjohn a Totane, brother of John FitzGerald, de facto 12th Earl of Desmond, and Julia O'Mulryan of County Tipperary, cousin of Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond.Ireland and her people; a library of Irish biography, (Thomas W. H. Fitzgerald, ed.), Fitzgerald Book Company, 1910, p. 208 Totane had been granted the barony of Kerricurrihy in County Cork, but Gerald fell out with Totane and wars were fought between the families. After the Desmond defeat at Battle of Affane in 1565, the 15th Earl and his brother, John of Desmond, were detained in England. During their absence, FitzMaurice became captain general of County Desmond with the warrant of the Earl. This meant he had authority over the soldiers retained in the service of the Desmond Fitzgeralds.\\"Fitzgerald, James Fitzmaurice\\", Dictionary of National Biography, 1903 In July 1568, he entered Clanmaurice, the territory of the lord of Lixnaw, to distrain for rent and assert the Desmond authority: having seized 200 head of cattle and wasted the country, he was confronted by Lixnaw on the way home and utterly defeated. == Alienation from Desmond == At the end of 1568, the absent Earl of Desmond granted Sir Warham St Leger a lease of the barony of Kerricurrihy, which cast FitzMaurice's inheritance into confusion. In 1569 the lord deputy of Ireland, Sir Henry Sidney, was informed by FitzMaurice that he had assembled the people of Desmond to tell them that the lord deputy was unable to procure the release of the captive earl, who would be executed or perpetually imprisoned, and that the people should proclaim a new earl or captain: with one voice, the people were said to have cried out for FitzMaurice to be captain. The earl's wife, Eleanor Butler, wrote to her husband in November that FitzMaurice was seeking to bring the earl into further disrepute and to usurp his inheritance, \\"by the example of his father\\". To reassert Geraldine authority, FitzMaurice then launched what would become known as the first of the Desmond Rebellions. The southern part of Ireland erupted into a general rebellion, owing in part to attempts at establishing plantations. In June 1569, FitzMaurice and the Earl of Clancarty (MacCarthy Mor) invaded Kerrycurrihy, spoiled the inhabitants, took the castle-abbey of Tracton, hanged the garrison, and refused to depart without the surrender to them of the custody of Lady St Leger and Lady Grenville, the wives of the principal English colonists. FitzMaurice then joined in league with the turbulent brothers of the earl of Ormond, and entered a bond with the Earl of Thomond and John Burke, son of the Earl of Clanricard. He wrote to the mayor and corporation of Cork in July ordering the abolition of the new heresy of Protestantism, at a time when he appears to have been taking instruction from Irish Jesuits. By September 1569, Sidney had broken the back of the rebellion and left Sir Humphrey Gilbert behind to suppress FitzMaurice, who sought refuge in the woods of Aherlow, and after Gilbert's departure FitzMaurice raised a new force in February 1570 and by a surprise night attack, took Kilmallock and after hanging the chief townsmen at the market cross, plundered its wealth and burned the town. In February 1571, Sir John Perrot landed at Waterford as President of Munster and challenged FitzMaurice to a duel, which FitzMaurice declined with the remark, \\"For if I should kill Sir John Perrot the Queen of England can send another president into this province; but if he do kill me there is none other to succeed me or to command as I do.\\" FitzMaurice attacked Perrot, but retired on mistaking a small cavalry company for the advance party of a larger force. After a second and successful siege by Perrot of the Geraldine stronghold of Castlemaine, FitzMaurice sued for pardon, which was granted in February 1573, after he prostrated himself in Kilmallock church with the president's sword point next to his heart.Hull, Eleanor. \\"The Desmond rebellion\\", A History of Ireland and Her People, 1926 FitzMaurice swore fealty to the crown, and gave up his son as hostage. == Continental intrigue == On the return to Ireland of the Earl of Desmond in 1573, FitzMaurice left for the continent, offering his reasons variously as a desire to gain pardon from the queen through the French court, and the unkindness of the earl. In March 1575 he and his family, along with the Geraldine Seneschal of Imokilly, James Fitzedmund Fitzgerald, and the White Knight, Edmund Fitzgibbon, sailed on the La Arganys for St Malo, Brittany where they were received by the governor. He had several interviews with Catherine de' Medici in Paris, offering to help make Henry III of France king of Ireland, and was granted a pension of 5,000 crowns in 1576. Early in the following year he left for the Spanish court, where he offered the crown to the brother of King Philip II, Don John; the king was cautious, however. FitzMaurice left his sons Maurice and Gerald with Cardinal Granvelle, and travelled to Italy to meet Pope Gregory XIII. == Invasion of Ireland == At the papal court FitzMaurice met adventurer Captain Thomas Stukley, and together they persuaded the pope to underwrite the cost of 1,000 troops to invade Ireland, most of whom, according to O'Sullivan Beare, were desperadoes the pope wished to get out of Italy. Fitzmaurice and Stukley were to rendezvous in Lisbon and proceed to Ireland, however, Stukley decided to throw his troops and support to King Sebastian's expedition to Morocco, where he died.Hayden, Mary Teresa and Moonan, George Aloysius. A Short History of the Irish People from the Earliest Times to 1920, Longmans, Green and Company, 1922 Following the diversion of Stukley to Morocco, FitzMaurice set out with the nuncio, Nicholas Sanders, and Matthew de Oviedo from Ferrol in Galicia, Spain on 17 June 1579 with a few troops on his vessel and three Spanish shallops; they captured two English vessels in the channel and arrived at Dingle on 16 July 1579, launching the Second Desmond Rebellion. On the 18th they cast anchor in Smerwick, where they garrisoned at Dún an Óir (Fort of Gold), and were joined on the 25th by two galleys with 100 troops; four days later their ships were captured by the English fleet under the command of Sir William Winter. Having exhorted the Earl of Desmond and the Earl of Kildare, as Geraldine leaders, to fight the heretics, FitzMaurice left the fort to await the arrival of Stukley (who, unknown to him, had been killed at the Battle of Alcácer Quibir in the previous year, during a campaign by King Sebastian of Portugal). FitzMaurice went to make a vow at the monastery of the Holy Cross in Tipperary but became caught in a skirmish with the forces of his cousin, Theobald Burke, during which he was shot with a ball in the hollow of the chest, but cut his way through to Burke and his brother William, both of whom he killed with single strokes of his sword. The battle was won, but close to the scene his injuries overcame him; he made his will and ordered his friends to cut off his head after death in order that his enemies might not mutilate his body; he begged his attendants to attest that he had not turned tail on the enemy. They assured him, and wished him to be quiet because hostile soldiers were closing in, but he insisted, \\"My wounds are clear, my wounds are clear\\". Upon his death, a kinsman ordered the decapitation and then wrapped the head in cloth; an attempt was made to conceal his trunk under a tree, but it was discovered by a hunter and brought to the town of Kilmallock. For weeks, the trunk was nailed to the gallows, until it was shattered by musket fire and collapsed. == Legacy == FitzMaurice married Katherine Burke of Muskerry, and they had three children by him: two sons, Maurice and Gerald, and one daughter, Alice, who married Niall, son of Aodh mac Felim O'Neill, and whose son Niall Oge O'Neill married Lady Sarah MacDonnell, daughter of the first Earl of Antrim. The invasion force at Smerwick was besieged and massacred after surrender in 1580 by the English. The tide turned in favour of the English, and the Second Desmond Rebellion was ended in 1583, when the Earl of Desmond and his followers had been hunted down and killed by the English and their Irish allies. The destruction of the Desmond dynasty ended with the Desmond lands being parcelled out to English 'undertakers', and was a major step in the Tudor conquest of Ireland. FitzMaurice was one of the first Irish leaders to use the Catholic cause as an explicit justification for rebellion against the crown. Hugh O'Neill may have been influenced by the FitzMaurice revolts, setting an example for his own major revolt in the 1590s. He is regarded by some as the man the Geraldines ought to have chosen to lead them if they were to resist the Protestant reformation. ==References== ==Sources== * Bagwell, Richard.

The tower is the third tallest skyscraper in Frankfurt and also in Germany. ==Design == === Overview === The building, designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, is similar in style to an older building by the same architects, 1250 René-Lévesque in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The building is a reinforced concrete structure with a perforated facades and flat slabs. The floor height is usually 3.6 m with a floor area of 950 square meters. The facade consists of fine, golden granite, giving it a white and bright appearance from afar. The building was designed by architect William Pedersen. The characteristic ring beam at the top of the tower (known commonly as the crown) is a reminiscent of the Statue of Liberty, but is also intended as a reminder to Frankfurt's history as the city where German emperors were crowned. The crown faces towards the old part of Frankfurt where the coronations were held at the Frankfurt Cathedral.

Blasetti was one of the leading figures in Italian cinema during the Fascist era. He is sometimes known as the \\"father of Italian cinema\\" because of his role in reviving the struggling industry in the late 1920s.Moliterno p. 40 ==Early life== Blasetti in 1954 Blasetti in 1965 Blasetti was born in Rome, where he also died. After studying law at university, Blasetti chose to become a journalist and film critic. He worked for several film magazines and led a campaign for national film production, which had largely ceased by this point.Moliterno p. 41 In 1919 he made a brief foray into acting when he appeared as an extra in Mario Caserini's Tortured Soul. ==Director== In 1929 Blasetti made his directorial debut with Sun, a fictional story set against the ongoing draining of the Pontine Marshes. The film was well received at a time when there were few Italian films being made. Benito Mussolini described it as \\"the dawn of the Fascist film\\".Reich, Jacqueline & Garofalo, Piero (2002). Re-Viewing Fascism: Italian Cinema, 1922 to 1943. Indiana University Press. p. 235. . Like many of his early productions, it had elements that were a precursor to neorealism. The strong reception for Sun led to Blasetti receiving an offer from Stefano Pittaluga, the only significant commercial producer left working in Italy at the time. Pittaluga had recently converted his Rome studios for sound films. Blasetti directed what would have been the first Italian sound film Resurrection, but delays meant that it was released after Gennaro Righelli's The Song of Love.Moliterno pp. 40–41 In 1934 Blasetti directed the play 18 BL a \\"mass theatre\\" performed outdoors with 2,000 amateur actors.Balfour, Michael (2001). Theatre and War, 1933–1945: Performance in Extremis. Berghahn Books. pp. 12–19. . Blasetti was a driving force in the revival of the Italian film industry in the 1930s, having lobbied for greater state funding and support. One outcome was the construction of the large Cinecittà studios in Rome. ==Later life== He played himself in Luchino Visconti's film Bellissima starred by Anna Magnani, a Roman mother who desires to make her daughter a filmstar in Cinecittà where Blasetti makes the screen test for the child actors. He was President of the Jury at the 1967 Cannes Film Festival.

The parish (until 1910 known as Preesall with Hackensall) covers the eastern bank of the estuary of the River Wyre, including Knott End-on-Sea, Pilling Lane and the village of Preesall itself. The parish of Preesall had a population of 5,314 recorded in the 2001 census, rising to 5,694 at the 2011 census. ==History== There is evidence that the eastern side of the River Wyre was occupied during the Danish invasions of the 9th and 10th centuries. Preesall is mentioned in the Domesday Book (1086) as being a part of the Hundred of Amounderness and the Domesday place name is given as Pressouede. The names Preesall and Hackensall are both probably Norse in origin, with Preesall meaning \\"a hill and a heath\\" and Hackensall probably deriving from \\"Haakon\\", a Viking seafarer who sailed up the River Wyre and set up an encampment in the 10th century. In 1190 the land was granted to a bowman in the service of Prince John, and in the 16th century, the land, like much in this area, passed into the possession of the Fleetwood family. Richard Fleetwood built Hackensall Hall in 1656 after their home at Rossall Hall was flooded. Nearby Parrox Hall was built about the same time, and has been in the possession of the Elletson family since 1690. A known site of high archaeological importance is the former Hackensall Tide Mill (Site PRN15022, SD 35114659) at Preesall. This mill is known from documentary sources and may date from before 1260; its site is indicated on the OS 1:10,560 mapping of 1848 (sheet Lancashire 43). Other watermill sites of this period are known in the county, although this appears to be the only tide mill and very few simple medieval mill sites have been investigated in the field. Physical remains of medieval watermills are rare nationally and surviving remains are likely to be of national, rather than local, importance.Lancashire County Council response to \\"PROPOSED 2D SEISMIC SURVEY – PREESALL UNDERGROUND GAS STORAGE PROJECT\\" July 2013 ==Governance== Preesall was an urban district from 1900 to 1974. It was also known as Preesall-With-Hackensall. It was abolished in 1974 and amalgamated under the Local Government Act 1972 to form part of the district of Wyre, but retained its own mayor and town council. ==Geography== The beach surrounding Pilling, Preesall and Knott-End is known as Preesall Beach. Preesall is protected from high tides by a sea defence known as the \\"Sea Wall\\". There is a path on the sea wall that leads from Knott End-on-Sea to Pilling and at a point next to Preesall pumping station, the sea wall goes over an old, now filled in, stone pillbox from the Second World War which is camouflaged among the rocks. West of the village itself lies a number of bodies of water, known locally as the Flashes. These were formed in the 1920s and 1930s by subsidence from salt mining and caused the mines' closure in 1931. ICI continued to use the mines and land nearby for brine pumping until the 1980s. ==Parrox Hall== Parrox Hall is a Grade II* listed country house, probably built in the early 17th century, which replaced and partly incorporated a previous building. It stands in its own grounds on the southern edge of the village of Preesall and is built of rendered brick in two storeys to an H-shaped floor plan. The site of the hall has been continuously owned by members of the same family who have descended from the original Lord of the Manor of Preesall-with-Hackensall, Geoffrey the Crossbowman (Galfridus Arbalastarius). He was a Norman soldier who was granted six carucates of land by Prince John in 1189. The last family member to own the hall was Daniel Hope Elletson, who set up a trust to safeguard the hall's future. The Trust is currently undertaking a number of conservation and restoration projects. The hall hosts meetings, seminars and discussions and is also open to visiting groups by appointment and to the general public on a number of open days each summer. ==Public houses== Preesall has one pub remaining: The Black Bull. ==Education== The village has three schools—a secondary and two primary schools. Saint Aidan's, located on Cartgate, is a Church of England secondary school. Preesall Fleetwood's Charity School is a Church of England primary school on Mill Street. Carter's Charity Voluntary Controlled Primary School, is located on Pilling Lane. The entrepreneur Robin Drinkall attended Fleetwood's Charity School in the early 1970s. ==Transport== Preesall used to lie on the long closed Garstang and Knot-End Railway which was built to provide an outlet for farmers in Over Wyre to transport their produce up and down the country. This section of the line opened on 30 July 1908, along with Preesall railway station. However, the line closed to passengers on 29 March 1930. There are bus services to and from both Lancaster and Blackpool. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Preesall ==References== ==External links== *The Heald family of Preesall House Category:Civil parishes in Lancashire Category:Towns in Lancashire Category:Geography of the Borough of Wyre Category:The Fylde ","title":"Preesall"},{"id":"3242351","text":"The Manaki brothers, Yanaki and Milton, were Aromanian photography and cinema pioneers of the Balkan Peninsula and the Ottoman Empire.

The area became a center of the Romanian national movement among the Aromanians in the 1860s.Rethinking Violence: States and Non-State Actors in Conflict, Erica Chenoweth, Adria Lawrence, MIT Press, 2010, , p. 105. Their father, Dimitrios, joined the movement,Christodoulou, Christos K., \\"The Manakis brothers, the Greek pioneers of the Balkan cinema\\", Organization for the Cultural Capital of Europe Thessaloniki 1997, p. 33. and to some extent the brothers developed a sense of Aromanian identity.Cinema of flames: Balkan film, culture and the media, Dina Iordanova, British Film Institute, 2001, , p. 213.The Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of the Documentary Film, Ian Aitken, Routledge, 2013, , p. 71.According to Jane K. Cowan (University of Sussex) \\"Fixing National Subjects in 1920's Southern Balkans\\": \\"Born in the 1880s as Ottoman subjects, they were the sons of a bourgeois, multilingual Vlach family... By the 1860s, long before their birth, the boys’ father, Dimitrios, had become attracted to the Romanian national movement. As a young teacher in the early years of the new century, Yannakis also became involved in the Romanian national movement which emerged in Avdela... Both brothers allegedly supported 'Balkan Federation'. For years, they lived peripatetically between Avdela, Yannina, Bitola, Plovdiv, Bucharest, and London. But ultimately, national borders rigidified and separated them for good... Yannakis died in Salonika in 1954 a Greek citizen, while his brother Miltos died in Monastir (now Bitola) a Yugoslav citizen.\\" They both attended Romanian elementary school in Avdella. Milton studied at the Romanian high school in Yanya and Yanaki at the Romanian high school in Manastir. Yanaki was interested in painting, calligraphy, and photography, during his high school years. Milton was not engaged by high school and dropped out after completing one year; his parents sent him to Gerebena to learn a craft, but he returned home and was supported by his parents. After completing high school, Yanaki worked as a teacher. === Career in photography and film === alt=Portrait of Yanaki Manaki with his camera alt= alt= alt= alt=Milton Manaki filming with Bioscope Camera 300 in a valley Yanaki was employed as an art teacher in a Romanian school in Yanya when he opened his first photographic studio in 1898. Yanaki asked his brother to join him and learn photography. Yanaki gained interest in photography and quickly learned the craft. Yanaki, after many negotiations, purchased a plot of land on the main street of the capital of the Rumelia Eyalet within Vilayet of Manastir—Manastir. In 1904 both brothers started to work on the construction of their independent workshop, which they named Atelier for Photographic Art.Kolektiv, Distinguished people for Bitola, NUUB St. Clement of Ohrid, Bitola, 2007, page 123 Yanaki permanently moved to Manastir in 1905. Milton initially worked as a cleaner in the studio, maintaining the equipment, but later he studied photography and quickly showed expertise. It is assumed that Milton began to participate in the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization during this time. Milton took approximately fifty photographs of Aromanian revolutionaries in the organization. It is also believed that Milton helped transport arms from Albania to Macedonia for the 2nd Revolutionary Committee of Bitola. The Manakis had a passion for travel. They traveled separately through many of the European capitals. When the brothers went together to Bucharest in 1905, they were told that film cameras could be purchased in London. Yanaki was interested and while traveling through Paris and Vienna, he stopped in England to buy a Bioscope 300 film camera from Charles Urban Trading Company.\\"Moving through the European capitals Yanaki stays a short time in London where he finds what he was searching for. That was a historical event for him, and he buys the Bioscope 300 camera from Charles Urban Trading.\\" Makedonska Nacija - Yanaki Manaki pioneer in the Balkan's photography and cinematography. With this camera they filmed their 114-year-old grandmother Despina; this was the first film shot in southeastern Europe. The film was made only then years after the first Lumière brothers film, which had influenced the brothers. King Carol I invited them to visit Romania for a second time to participate in the Bucharest Jubilee Exhibition, a photographic contest, held from the fifth to the twelfth of November 1906. They won a gold and silver medal for their work and were named the official photographers of the Romanian King. The brothers traveled in the region to take photographs, mostly in Aromanian-populated villages. Parallel to their photography work, the brothers started to film documentaries. During the Young Turk Revolution of 1908 and 1909, they took around 450 photographs and a short film that recorded every significant event of that period. In 1909, they filmed and made a series of photographs of the arrival of the royal Romanian delegation to Manastir. They also filmed the visit of the Turkish Sultan Mehmed V to Manastir in 1911—Milton traveled to the port of Selanik (now Thessaloniki) where he recorded the arrival of the Sultan by boat, then the Sultan's train journey on the Selanik–Manastir route, the Sultan's reception on the railway station in Manastir, as well as events held in honor of the visit of the Sultan. The same year they were honored as official photographers of the Ottoman Sultan. The First Balkan War started on 18 October 1912 between Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, and Greece. Because of the Treaty of Bucharest, the town of Manastir was occupied by the Serbian army on 6 November 1912. Milton and Yanaki took over 200 photographs of Serbian officers and soldiers and important political figures of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In early 1914, Milton Manaki made a trip to Grevena and Advella to see his parents and relatives. After returning home he was recruited by the Serbian armed forces, but he was soon released on account of his contacts with high Serbian authorities. Due to the conflicts and wars from 1914 to 1915, the brothers did not produce much work and got into financial trouble. They borrowed money from different clients. When the Serbian army withdrew from Bitola, Bulgarian officers inspected the brothers' atelier and found three shotguns, and although Milton had purchased these, Yanaki was interned in Bulgaria. Yanaki bought property in the Bulgarian village Straja and started breeding horses. Because of the bombing of Bitola in World War I, Milton constantly traveled through Korçë to Thessaloniki. Their photography worked revived In 1916 when Bulgarian and German officers wanted their pictures taken at the atelier. Milton produced a wide range of portraits of Bulgarian, German, Serbian, French, and Italian officers and soldiers as well as Russian volunteers. But in the second half of 1916, the city of Bitola was again occupied by Serbian and French soldiers. The city was bombed by German and Bulgarian forces. Bombs struck their atelier and destroyed their camera and other equipment. Yanaki returned from internment in Bulgaria in 1919, and decided with Milton to retire the destroyed atelier. The two brothers expanded their activity into the cinema in 1921 as a new source of revenue. They bought а film projector and made an outdoor cinema on the main street Shirok Sokak. The brothers then transformed it into an indoor theater, the first movie theater in Bitola, in 1923; they named it Manaki. The next movies the brothers made were multiple greetings of Alexander I of Yugoslavia to Bitola, a memorial to the lost French and Serbian soldiers, a 1922 explosion in Bitola, the wedding of Petar Gerass, and the wedding of the first Macedonian artist Risto Zerda in Prilep. The Manaki brothers sent a letter to the marshal of the Serbian Royal Court in 1928. They asked to be named the official royal photographers based on their credibility as photographers of the Romanian king and Ottoman sultan. Their request was accepted in 1929 by the office of the royal court. In 1935, Milton married Aromanian compatriot Vasiliki Dauka and their son Leonid was born on 10 May of the same year. Yanaki left Bitola in 1937 and left Milton to work alone as a photographer. Milton filmed one of his most famous documentaries, The Bombing of Bitola, in 1940. During World War II the area was annexed by Kingdom of Bulgaria. Milton got a license to work as a photographer and took over 1200 photographs. The Germans retreated on 4 November 1944 and the Yugoslav Partisans took over Bitola; Milton caught this on camera. During this time, Milton took around 5,000 photographs of many themes: politics, weddings, armed forces, sports, etc. Some of his most historically important photographs are of Josip Broz Tito in Bitola. === Later life === Yanaki left the field of photography in 1935 and moved to Thessaloniki, Greece, where he remained for the rest of his life. Milton sold all of his 1500-meter film footage to the government of Socialist Republic of Macedonia for 1,000,000 dinars. Milton also worked with the Cinematique of Yugoslavia in Belgrade. The government duplicated all of the films and returned the originals to Milton in 1954. Milton continued to work as a photographer and filmmaker for the government until his death. The Organization of Yugoslav Film Makers made Milton an honored member in 1957 for being the first filmmaker in the region. Zagreb Film made a documentary film about Milton's work and career in 1958. At this time, the National Technique of Macedonia awarded him with a memory diploma. Milton remained in Bitola, Yugoslavia, until his death in 1964. == Filmography == { class= style=text-align:right !Film !Year !Running time !Theme !Milton !Yanaki - align=leftGrandmother Despina 1905 60 seconds weaving style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes - align=leftWeavers 1905 60 seconds weaving style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes - align=leftOutdoor School 1905 120 seconds school style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes - align=leftParade of Military Band, Carriages and Horsemen 1908 60 seconds Young Turk Revolution style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes - align=leftEvents marking Hurriyet 1908 120 seconds Young Turk Revolution style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes - align=leftTurks Hold Speech 1908 120 seconds Young Turk Revolution style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes - align=leftParade to Mark Hurriyet 1908 4 minutes Young Turk Revolution style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes - align=leftManifestations (With Greek Inscriptions) 1908 60 seconds Young Turk Revolution style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes - align=leftEvents Marking the Young Turk Revolution 1908 120 seconds Young Turk Revolution style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes - align=leftThe Funeral of the Metropolitan Aimilianos of Gravena 1911 6 minutes funeral style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes - align=leftPanorama of Grevena 1911 60 seconds Grevena style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes - align=leftRomanian Delegation Visiting Bitola, Gopesh, Resen 1911 120 seconds  style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes - align=leftTurkish Sultan Mehmed V Reshad Visiting Bitola 1911 16 minutes Ottoman Sultan Mehmed V style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes Unknown - align=leftChurch in grevena 1911 60 seconds Grevena style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes - align=leftAlexander Karađorđević Visiting Bitola 1912 4 minutes Alexander I of Yugoslavia style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes - align=leftOpening the City Restaurant in Bitola 1912 120 seconds Bitola style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes - align=leftWelcoming of the Greek King and Heir to the Throne Paul by General Bojovic, in Bitola 1912 60 seconds Paul of Greece style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes - align=leftBombing of Bitola 1940 unknown World War II style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #FFE6E6;\\"No - align=leftEntering of the National Liberation Army in Bitola 1944 unknown World War II, Socialist Yugoslavia style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #FFE6E6;\\"No - align=leftGreeting of Tito in Bitola 1963 20 minutes Josip Broz Tito style=\\"background: #E6FFEA;\\"Yes style=\\"background: #FFE6E6;\\"No - align=center colspan=6Source: Cinematheque of Macedonia } == Legacy == alt=Statue of Milton Manaki The Manaki brothers are regarded as the pioneers of cinematography in many countries, but in general—the Balkans. The films they made marked the beginning of ethnographic documentaries in the Balkans.History of Greek Cinema - Manaki Brothera - page 4, Vrasidas Karalis, 2002 They are credited for capturing the notable historical events of the Balkan and Macedonia region in the time before, during, and in between World War I and World War II. Most of their work can be found in the film archives of North Macedonia and Greece. Some of their photographs and film footage were lost or destroyed in the 1916 bombing of their studio and the 1939 burning of their theater. The plot of Theo Angelopoulos's film Ulysses' Gaze revolves around the fictional and metaphoric quest for a lost and undeveloped reel of film shot by the Manaki brothers before the Balkans were split by the forces of nationalism. It opens with the images of their grandmother spinning wool. The first documentary about the Manaki brothers was from Zagreb Film in 1958, and in 1988 a Greek-language documentary was released.Marian Tutui, Romanian Film Archive, Manakia Bros Pioneers of Balkan Cinema claimed by six nations. Balkan cinema versus cinema of the Balkan nations. To honor the brothers, the Manaki Brothers Film Festival, first organized on 21 May 1950, is held in Bitola (where Milton reside for 60 years until his death). The festival holds a contest in which the winner receives the Golden Camera 300 award, named for their legendary camera.

Whilst celebrating his win, he fell into the moat around the track at the Estadio Olímpico Universitario in Mexico City.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat;=19751014&id;=SrgsAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=4AkEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=4201,3015183 \\"Cuban sprinter hurt as U.S. takes Pan-American lead\\", Star News, October 14, 1975. The injury he suffered to his back required surgery and severely hampered his preparations for the 1976 Olympics. In the race itself, Leonard defeated the Trinidadian Hasely Crawford who was to win the Olympic 100 metres title the following year. Leonard did recover in time to compete at the 1976 Montreal Olympics but there suffered another misfortune. He cut his left leg on broken glass in the Olympic Village. The injury badly affected his running and he was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In 1977, Leonard was at the peak of his powers. He became the second athlete to run the 100 metres in less than 10 seconds with electronic timing, running in 9.98 s on August 11 in Guadalajara (the first was 1968 Olympic champion Jim Hines), nowadays Leonard stands as the only Spanish-speaking 10-second barrier athlete. Leonard also had good speed endurance which he proved when he was the fastest in the world that year in the 200 metres with a time of 20.08 s. At the inaugural Athletics World Cup that year, Leonard won bronze in both the 100 and 200 metres whilst representing the Americas. On 13 September he set a low-altitude world best time for the 100 m at 10.03 s.Progression of IAAF World Records 2011 Edition, Editor Imre Matrahazi, IAAF Athletics, p 33.The IAAF world records take no account of altitude of the record's venue. However, as it is recognised that sprint events are assisted by altitude, due to decreased air resistance, a separate list is kept of best marks at sea level when they are inferior to the actual world record. He also won the 1977 100-metre Gold at the World Student Games. In 1978 he successfully defended his double Golds in the 100/200 metres at the Central American and Caribbean Games. He also set a personal best and world's fastest time at the 200 metres of 20.06 s on 19 June in Warsaw. In 1979, at the second Athletics World Cup he won the 200 metres and was runner- up in the 100 metres. He was also Cuban champion and won the Soviet 100 metres championship that year. At the 1980 Summer Olympics Leonard won a silver medal in 100 metres, finishing behind Allan Wells of Great Britain. He then went on to finish 4th in the Olympic 200 metres final in a time of 20.30, narrowly missing out on another medal. Leonard was never a factor at world level after the 1980 season and disappointingly there has been no legacy of world-class Cuban sprinters to follow him and his 100 and 200 metres bests are still Cuban records.As of October 2012. He retired in 1985 and is reportedly now a track coach.http://www.athlecac.org/HallofFame/silvioleonard.htm Silvio LEONARD SARRÍA , Hall of Fame, AthleCAC.org.

Afterwards, he obtained his M.A. on philosophy at Duke University. The UBA was intervened by the military government in 1966, so he resigned to his work as a teacher and worked in investigations at the Oxford university instead. He is credited as a pioneer of analytic philosophy in Argentina. He was one of the founders and president of SADAF, the Argentine Society of Analytic Philosophy and the editor of its journal, Análisis filosófico. He created that organization alongside Genario Carrió, Gregorio Klimovsky and Carlos Alchourrón, after his return from the United Kingdom. He was designated by President Raúl Alfonsín member of the CONADEP, the national Commission to determine the fate of desaparecidos. The work was included in the Nunca más report. He was also appointed Undersecretary of Human Rights. He was also a member of APDH. He was called as a witness in the Trial of the Juntas, to explain his work for the CONADEP. He also helped Uruguay to clarify the fate of 130 Uruguayan died in Argentina during the Dirty War. He died in Cuzco, Perú on November 11, 2005, while participating in a professional congress. == Works == * Filosofía de la mente y ciencia cognitiva, 1995 * La filosofía y el filosofar, 1994 * La carta universal de los derechos humanos, 1987 * Etica y análisis, 1985 * Philosophical Analysis in Latin America, 1982 (редактор) * Estudios éticos, 1977 * Análisis filosófico, lenguaje y metafísica, 1977 * La justificación moral del castigo, 1976 == Bibliography == * Eduardo Rabossi: In Memoriam // Areté Revista de Filosofía Vol. XVIII, N° 2, 2006 * ==References== == External links == * Premio Konex — Currículum Category:1930 births Category:2005 deaths Category:People from Buenos Aires Category:Argentine people of Italian descent Category:Argentine philosophers Category:Duke University alumni Category:20th-century Argentine philosophers Category:Argentine human rights activists ","title":"Eduardo Rabossi"},{"id":"3242381","text":"The golden-mantled tamarin (Leontocebus tripartitus) is a tamarin species from South America. It is found in Ecuador and Peru, specifically in the upper Amazon (lowland), east of the Andes in Ecuador, and Northeast Peru; between the Rio Curaray and Rio Napo in Peru. ==Taxonomic classification== There has been some debate over the placing of L. tripartitus. In field observations in South America, scientists compared feeding habits and heights between golden- mantled tamarins (L. tripartitus) and brown-mantled tamarins (Leontocebus fuscicollis) and they concluded that patterns of height were very similar to those observed in S. fuscicollis. The similarity and the lack of evidence for sympatry with either L. fuscicollis or the black-mantled tamarin (Leontocebus nigricollis) led to the suggestion that L. tripartitus should be reconsidered as a subspecies of L. fuscicollis rather than a species on its own; alternatively, other subspecies of L. fuscicollis should be raised in taxonomic rank. It is currently considered a separate species within the saddle-back tamarin genus Leontocebus. ==Description== This tamarin measures 218–240 mm from the tip of the nose to the beginning of the tail and has a tail length of 316–341 mm. Its ear length is 31–32 mm. The head is black, with a black collar of hair continuous under the throat. The muzzle and sometimes face are pure white, and the neck has a ruff of bright golden to creamy fur dorsally, sharply contrasting with the black crown. Its underparts are orange. The long tail is not prehensile, as in all tamarins, and the large eyes face forward. The species is monomorphic. It has large canines and claw-like nails on all digits except the opposable. ==Behavior== The golden-mantled tamarin is an arboreal, diurnal species ranging through the understory, moving by quadrupedal walk and leap, mainly on small horizontal supports. Leaping is the main gap-crossing mode of locomotion, though it decreases in proportion with a higher use of the upper forest layers. It forages most actively between 4–10 meters off the forest floor, and eats mainly fruit, nectar and insects but also consumes gum from either natural holes or holes created by the pygmy marmoset. Due to its small body size, limited gut volume, and rapid rate of food passage, tamarins require a diet high in nutrient quality and available energy. Water accumulated on leaves, in flower cups, or in hollows is lapped; dew and moisture from a hand previously dipped in water are licked. Callitrichids do not suck up liquids or hold vessels to the mouth as do most cebids and catarrhines. The faculty of suckling, a specialization of the young, disappears soon after weaning. During the dry season they are known to be less active and more social due to low food sources. ===Chemosignalling=== Marmosets and tamarins possess a rich repertoire of chemosignalling behaviors. These are associated closely with investigatory behaviors. In all species, the most conspicuous and most frequently seen chemosignalling behaviors are stereotyped scent-marking patterns involving the circumgenital and suprapubic glands, urine, and the sternal gland. Most scent marking is performed on items in the environment. In addition, marking the bodies of partners has also been reported for several species. ==Reproduction== Tamarins live in small groups of usually four to nine individuals and have some interesting reproductive traits. They give birth to twins, and only one female (the dominant individual) breeds in any single social group. The hormones present in the dominant female's urine suppress the reproductive cycles in the subordinate females of the group. Groups are polygynandrous. Gestation averages at 140 days. Callitrichids in general are unique in the intensity of their relations to infants. The newborns may be carried from the first day by group members other than the mother (including males in the group). Weaning occurs from 9–13 weeks, when most of the food ingested is obtained through sharing or stealing. At the juvenile stage (beginning at 4–7 months) 'twin fights' may occur, especially between same-sexed twins, to determine status differences. The sub- adult stage begins at 9–14 months, and the young animal has the size and appearance of an adult. Puberty takes place at this time but the young do not reproduce. At the adult stage (beginning at 12–21 months), sexual maturity is attained. ==Conservation status== In 2008, Leontocebus tripartitus was assessed by the IUCN Red List. This species is listed as Near Threatened in light of a projected future decline of around 25% over the course of three generations (18 years) due to anticipated high rates of deforestation. The forests where S. tripartitus occurs along the Rio Yasuni in Ecuador are remote and have, to date, suffered little impact from human activities, other than small localized encampments for petroleum prospecting. However, the occurrence of petroleum in the region, resulting in the current construction of the Pompeya-Iro highway, is reason for some concern for the future of these forests and their wildlife. ==References== == External links == *Infonatura golden-mantled tamarin Category:Mammals of Ecuador Category:Mammals of Peru golden-mantled tamarin ","title":"Golden-mantled tamarin"},{"id":"3242386","text":"The various film and theatre appearances of the Superman character have been accompanied by musical scores. ==Superman== The score for Superman, composed and conducted by John Williams, was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, with John Georgiadis as concertmaster. Recording took place on July 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, September 9, 10, 11, October 6 (Irvine Arditti, concertmaster), 15, 24, 31 (Richard Studt, concertmaster), and November 4, 1978, at the Anvil Studios in Denham, Bucks, England. Source music was recorded on July 17. The recording engineer was Eric Tomlinson, assisted by Alan Snelling. Orchestrations were by Herbert Spencer, Arthur Morton, Angela Morley and John Williams. The music editor was Bob Hathaway, assisted by Ken Ross. Williams' \\"Superman Theme\\", which is first heard during the opening credits to the film Superman, has been reused (with varying arrangements) as the opening music for every Superman film except for Superman III, in which Ken Thorne employed a lighthearted, somewhat comical cue to represent 'the streets of Metropolis.' It is also referenced in Jerry Goldsmith's score to the 1984 film Supergirl during a scene in which the title character sees a poster of Superman.Supergirl soundtrack review. Filmtracks.com. Retrieved 4 December 2011. In the 2017 film, Justice League, Danny Elfman is reusing Williams' Superman theme, as well as his themes from Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns for the new incarnation of the character. Blake Neely, the composer for the Arrowverse crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", incorporated the march theme and \\"Can You Read My Mind?\\" with Brandon Routh reprising his role as the Superman of Earth-96. ===Leitmotifs=== * \\"Superman Fanfare\\". A short triad-based motif, played just before the \\"Main Theme\\", or as a standalone when Superman appears in a quick-cut on-screen. Also restated many times in the \\"Superman March\\". * \\"Superman March\\" or \\"Superman Main Theme\\". Used over opening and closing credits. It consists of two sections, an \\"A\\" theme which is the main part of the melody and a \\"B\\" theme which is a bit lighter in mood and which often connects the \\"March\\" to the \\"Fanfare.\\" * \\"Can You Read My Mind\\" or the soaring \\"Love Theme\\". Typically used when Lois and Superman (or sometimes Clark) find themselves alone together. A portion of is introduced as an interlude in the midst of the \\"Superman March\\". Lyrics for the melody were written by longtime John Williams collaborator Leslie Bricusse, for the purpose of having a song during the film's extended \\"flying sequence.\\" Margot Kidder, who plays Lois Lane, speaks the lyrics in the film, but cover versions of the song have been recorded by Maureen McGovern, Shirley Bassey and others. * \\"Krypton fanfare\\". Used as the viewer zooms in on Krypton, and again with the self-construction of the Fortress of Solitude. * \\"Krypton crystal\\" motif or the \\"Secondary Krypton\\" motif. Mysterious-sounding theme associated with the physicality of the planet Krypton, both the crystals sent by Jor-El to Earth with his son and the radioactive kryptonite which is deadly to Superman. * \\"Personal\\" motif. A melody related to the duality of Superman and Clark Kent which musically connects the \\"Fanfare\\" to the \\"Love Theme\\". * \\"Smallville\\" or \\"Leaving Home Theme\\". A Coplandesque, Americana melody used during the Smallville sequences which in some ways is a simpler or undeveloped version of the March's \\"A\\" theme. It bears a similarity to a theme written by John Williams for the 1972 John Wayne western film The Cowboys. * \\"The March of the Villains\\" or \\"Lex Luthor theme\\". A comedic Prokofiev- inspired march associated with the villain Lex Luthor and his henchman Otis. ===Source Music=== A selection of existing songs were featured in Superman, not included on any version of the soundtrack albums, but readily available elsewhere: *\\"Rock Around the Clock\\", by Bill Haley & His Comets, was playing on the radio of the \\"Woodie\\" being driven by some of Clark Kent's high school classmates. The song seems out of context, as it was presumably 1964 at that point in the narrative, yet this song debuted in 1955. (It is later established that Kal-El's ship crashed in 1951, and in Superman III it is established that Clark graduates high school in 1965.) However, coincidentally (or not) the song introduces Glenn Ford's final scene in the film. Ford starred in the 1955 film Blackboard Jungle, in which that song was prominently featured. Incidentally, this song was not used in the television versions of the film, which instead used an original John Williams source cue composed and recorded for the film, called \\"Kansas Kids\\". *\\"Only You\\", by The Platters, is playing on the teenage Clark's bedside radio when he is awakened by the sound that leads him to the discovery of his spacecraft beneath the barn. This song was also not heard in the television cuts, which instead used only radio static. *Ten seconds of Supertramp's 1977 song, \\"Give a Little Bit\\" from the album Even in the Quietest Moments, were heard on Lois Lane's car radio just prior to the climactic earthquake scene. The song was a then-recent hit. Its appearance in the film seems to be for no obvious thematic reason, though there could be a subtle message or two: The group having \\"Super\\" in its name; and the words heard on-screen, \\"Give a little bit... [I'll] give a little bit of my life for you.\\" Source music written for the film: A Hawaiian-themed cue called \\"Luthor's Luau,\\" heard in the background in Lex Luthor's secret hideaway the day after Superman's debut around the city was composed by John Williams, who also wrote additional pieces of source music that were not used in the film. In some cases these were replaced by the existing songs listed above. However, some of Williams' versions were used in the extended television broadcast versions of the film in place of these. ===Concert Suites=== These are regularly performed in symphony and pops concerts, including those by composer John Williams, and have also been featured in re- recordings for various CD compilations. * \\"The March of the Villains\\" (Superman). * \\"Love Theme from Superman\\" (Superman). * \\"Theme from Superman\\" (Superman). This suite includes \\"Superman Fanfare\\", \\"Superman March\\" and the \\"Love Theme\\". ===Soundtrack Releases=== ====Warner Bros.==== December 20, 1978: 2-LP set from Warner Bros. Records. This album was released on CD in 1987 and is still in print, but it is missing the tracks \\"Growing Up\\" and \\"Lex Luthor's Lair\\". The Japanese issue, which was released in 1990, presents the full program, but is out of print and rare. ====Varèse Sarabande re- recording==== 1998: 2-CD set from Varèse Sarabande Records. This release is a re-recording of Williams' score, conducted by John Debney and performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, including the first release of additional music from the film in any form. As detailed in the liner notes, the project was hampered when it was discovered that the existing scores and parts for the Superman: The Movie score had been lost. When extensive efforts to locate them failed, a team of orchestrators reconstructed the music from John Williams' 8-12 stave composer sketches—thus there are subtle differences which may be noted in a number of the cues when compared to their original counterparts. The tempo of the cues in this re-recording are generally rather slower than in the original recording—possibly because the recording was made in the highly resonant acoustic of Glasgow City Hall. ====Rhino Records==== February 15, 2000: 2-CD set from Rhino This release combines the master for the original album with what were believed at the time to be the only surviving elements to reconstruct the full length of the original Williams recording. This release went out of print in 2005, but may still be available online through many internet music services. ====Film Score Monthly==== February 29, 2008: part of Superman: The Music (1978-1988) 8-CD set from Film Score Monthly. This release restores the complete score from newly discovered high quality original masters and includes previously unreleased material. Discs 1 and 2 of this 8 disc set present music from the film. Additional material is presented on disc 8. ====La-La Land ==== February 22, 2019: 3-CD set from La-La Land Records. For the 40th anniversary of the film's release, La-La Land Records released this 3-CD version of the complete score. In the intervening years between the release of the Film Score Monthly 8-CD set and this release, the original 24-track tapes from the recording sessions had been found, with La-La Land Records using these tapes as the source of the remaster. The result is increased dynamic range compared to previous releases. In addition, a new alternate version of \\"The Fortress of Solitude\\" was included on Disc 2 and a reconstructed and remastered version of the original album on Disc 3. ==Superman II== The score was composed, conducted and orchestrated by Ken Thorne (from original material composed by John Williams) Because of budget restrictions, the score was recorded by an orchestra of contract players rather than the London Symphony Orchestra. Recording took place on March 25, 26, 27, 29, April 17, 18, 25, and May 2, 1980, at CTS Studios (The Music Centre) in Wembley, Middlesex, England. The recording engineer was John Richards, assisted by Tim Pennington and James Abramson, and the music editor was Bob Hathaway. ===Leitmotifs=== Composer/arranger Ken Thorne was mandated to reuse the first film's themes for Superman II. He based the music for the Kryptonian villains on the Williams material associated with Krypton and the Fortress of Solitude. He also added a descending three-note motif for the villains and a briefly heard ominous melody associated with General Zod. ===Source Music=== *\\"Pick up the Pieces\\", by Average White Band, can be heard in the East Houston sequence. This replaced a piece called \\"East Houston Café\\" composed by Ken Thorne, which was not used. Thorne had been asked by director Richard Lester to write a \\"sound-alike\\" version of \\"Pick Up the Pieces,\\" but this was used for the scene in Don's Diner at the end of the film. Thorne wrote a few other pieces for various radios as well as \\"Honeymoon Hotel,\\" a piece played as Clark Kent and Lois Lane are shown around a tacky hotel suite at Niagara Falls. ===Soundtrack Releases=== ====Warner Bros.==== 1980: Single LP from Warner Bros. Records. This album and the original album for Superman III were combined for an out-of-print Japanese CD release. ====Film Score Monthly==== February 29, 2008: part of Superman: The Music (1978-1988) 8-CD set from Film Score Monthly. This release restores the complete score, which is presented on disc 3 of the 8 disc set, with additional music presented on disc 8. ==Superman III== The score was composed, conducted and orchestrated by Ken Thorne (with original Superman themes by John Williams). Recording took place on February 14, 15, 16, March 7, 8, 9 and 18, 1983 at CTS Studios (The Music Centre) in Wembley, Middlesex, England. The recording engineer was John Richards. The music editor was Bob Hathaway. ===Leitmotifs=== Ken Thorne was given a freer hand in the scoring of Superman III in accordance with the series' change in direction and more comedic tone. His new thematic material consisted of related themes for Gus Gorman and a general theme for computers, plus an ominous \\"Supercomputer\\" theme heard in the latter part of the score. Thorne also supplied a love theme for Lana Lang and Clark Kent, based on a melody written for the film by Giorgio Moroder. Lois Lane's theme is not present in the score because she only appears in the film briefly. ===Source Music=== *\\"Roll Over Beethoven,\\" the Chuck Berry hit as performed by The Beatles, and \\"Earth Angel\\" by The Penguins can be heard at Clark Kent's high school reunion. The use of a Beatles song was something of an in-joke referencing the films A Hard Day's Night and Help, both helmed by Superman III director Richard Lester. Giorgio Moroder was also commissioned to write several original songs for Superman III, some of which can be heard as source music in various scenes. ===Soundtrack Releases=== ====Warner Bros.==== 1983: LP from Warner Bros. Records. Superman III was the first of the films to have a score and song soundtrack combined on the same release, a common trend in the mid-1980s. Side A presented 19 minutes of Ken Thorne's score, while Side B contained music composed and produced by pop mogul Giorgio Moroder. These included three sung versions (with lyrics by Keith Forsey) of songs heard as source music in the film, plus Moroder's love theme for Clark Kent and Lana Lang (used by Thorne as the basis for his own theme), and ending with a completely synthesized version of the Superman II main title march. This album and the original album for Superman II were combined for an out-of-print Japanese CD release. ====Film Score Monthly==== February 29, 2008: part of Superman: The Music (1978-1988) 8-CD set from Film Score Monthly. This release restores the complete score, which is presented on disc 4 of the 8 disc set, with additional music presented on disc 8. ==Superman IV: The Quest for Peace== The score was adapted and conducted by Alexander Courage (from music by John Williams). Recording took place from May 11–18, 1987 at the Bavaria Studios in Munich, Germany, performed by Symphony-Orchestra Graunke. Recording engineer was Peter Kramper. Additional recording took place May 23-June 2, 1987, at CTS Studios (The Music Centre) in Wembley, Middlesex, England, performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra. Recording engineer was Dick Lewzey, assisted by Steve Price and Jonathan Ruttley. Orchestrations were by Frank Barber and Harry Roberts, and the music editor was Bob Hathaway. Jack Fishman was musical advisor. Songs by Paul Fishman were recorded in September 1986 in Hampstead, London, England. ===Leitmotifs=== John Williams composed three new themes for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, attaching to three new characters. *\\"Lacy's Theme,\\" also known as \\"Someone Like You,\\" is a sultry, sexy melody for the daughter of the new owner of the Daily Planet, who has eyes for Clark Kent. *\\"Jeremy's Theme\\" is a light, lyrical melody for the young boy who appeals to Superman to rid the world of nuclear weapons. *\\"Nuclear Man Theme\\" is a driving action theme used for Superman's battle with the villain created when Lex Luthor places Superman's genetic material on a nuclear warhead detonated by the sun. Alexander Courage adapted Williams' themes for the film, integrating the three new ones with all of the existing themes from Superman. He also supplied two new themes of his own: a \\"missile\\" motif for when nuclear arms are shown or discussed, and a \\"Russian\\" motif, a minor mode march used when Soviets and their weapons appear. ===Source Music=== *\\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\\" by Jerry Lee Lewis can be heard in Lenny Luthor's car when he's about to release his uncle, Lex Luthor, from prison. Paul Fishman, head of the 80s rock group Re-Flex, was commissioned to write original songs for the film, but only one of these, \\"Workout,\\" was used in the released version of the film, when Clark and Lacy are seen at the Metropolis Fitness Center. Some of Fishman's other songs were intended for a deleted Metro Club discothèque sequence. \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,\\" Fishman's \\"Workout,\\" \\"Headphone Heaven\\" and \\"Revolution Now\\" (the latter two were for the deleted scene) would have all appeared on the cancelled soundtrack album.Superman: The Music (1978-1988); \\"The Quest For An LP,\\" p. 135 of liner notes All songs except for Lewis' are included on 'Superman: The Music (1978-1988). ===Soundtrack Releases=== ====Film Score Monthly==== February 29, 2008: part of Superman: The Music (1978-1988) 8-CD set from Film Score Monthly. Alexander Courage completed a 100-minute score for a version of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace that ran over two hours. As a result of negative audience response to the preview, the picture was cut down to a length of 89 minutes for U.S. release. At the urging of visual effects supervisor Harrison Ellenshaw, two action scenes were reinstated for the international version, which ran 92 minutes and was later shown on U.S. television. As a result of this cutting of running time, much of the music was not heard and \\"Jeremy's Theme\\" in particular was virtually undetectable in the final version. Although an album release for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace was produced in 1987, it was aborted when the film was shortened. As with Superman III, it was to contain several songs (by Paul Fishman of Re-Flex) and a small sampling of the score by Alexander Courage (adapting John Williams' themes). In 2008, the 8-CD box set Superman: The Music (1978-1988) premiered the entire score for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace as composed for the long version of the film. Also included were all of Paul Fishman's songs created for the deleted Metro Club disco and other scenes in the film. Tracks in italics were intended to be released on the cancelled soundtrack album (Jerry Lee Lewis's \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On,\\" heard in the film, would also have been included). La-La Land Records re-released the complete soundtrack, with identical track listing, in 2018 as a stand-alone 2-CD set. ==Superman Returns== The score was composed by John Ottman. Director Bryan Singer originally wanted John Williams to score the film, but Williams declined due to a busy schedule. ===Soundtrack Releases=== ====Standard edition==== The tracks appear out of order compared to how they appear in the movie. This was done by Ottman for listening purposes. ==Man of Steel== Director Zack Snyder's 2013 reboot of the series, Man of Steel, is scored by Hans Zimmer, and is the first Superman film not to use any of Williams' themes. ===Soundtrack Releases=== ====Standard edition==== June 11, 2013: on CD from WaterTower Music. ====Deluxe edition==== The deluxe edition includes all the tracks in the standard edition, as well as the tracks shown here. The digital version of the deluxe edition lists the track \\"What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?\\" as the first track of the second disc rather than the last track of the first disc. ==Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice== ===Soundtrack Releases=== ====Standard edition==== March 18, 2016: on CD from WaterTower Music. ====Deluxe edition==== The deluxe edition includes all the tracks in the standard edition, as well as the tracks shown here. Many tracks featured in the film were not released with the official soundtrack in March 2016. These tracks were later released in the film's complete score nearly two years later, on March 6, 2018. ==Superman: The Ultimate Collection== *The radio shows of the early 1940s already had the famous phrases, \\"Faster than a speeding bullet... It's a bird... it's a plane... it's Superman!\\" uttered by studio announcer Jackson Beck. Initially, the radio series had no theme tune under its introductory lines. *The Superman cartoon series produced by the Fleischer Studios during the 1940s included a triad-based theme composed by Fleischer musical director Sammy Timberg. The cartoons were clearly intended to extend the characters from radio, as Jackson Beck again provided the introduction voiceover of the famous phrases, and Bud Collyer reprised his radio role as the Man of Steel. *The two Superman Columbia Pictures serials of the late 1940s, starring Kirk Alyn, featured a theme that began with a triad, repeated once. The rest of the theme was a standard orchestral march, in a minor key, that did not refer back to the original triad. This theme was composed by Mischa Bakaleinikoff, who scored a number of the Columbia serials' themes. *The 1951 film Superman and the Mole Men initially had an orchestral score by Darrel Calker featuring standard \\"sci fi\\" film overtones. That film was eventually edited down into the two-part episode which closed the TV series' first season, with the standard TV theme wrapped around it. *The 1966 Broadway musical It's a Bird...It's a Plane...It's Superman, starring Bob Holiday, featured music by Charles Strouse and lyrics by Lee Adams. The script was written by David Newman and Robert Benton, who would go on to write the second draft of the screenplay for the first Superman film, released in 1978. All of the above (as well as some TV and film themes) were recorded by a modern orchestra and released on a 1999 CD called Superman: The Ultimate Collection, released by Varèse Sarabande Records. ==Adventures of Superman: The Original 1950s TV Series== The TV theme for the 1950s series Adventures of Superman, starring George Reeves, had the unusual lead-in of a harp playing a kind of stringed \\"drumroll\\" as the camera moved through space, segueing into a dramatic brass triad accompanied by cymbals, drums, etc., at the moment when a shooting star explodes on the screen and the title card appears. A variation on the classic \\"Faster than a speeding bullet...\\" was rendered by deep-voiced actor Bill Kennedy. Three of the main characters from the show utter the famous lines \\"Look, up in the sky!\\" \\"It's a bird!\\" \\"It's a plane!\\". They are actors Robert Shayne, who played Inspector Henderson, George Reeves himself and Phyllis Coates who played the first Lois Lane. The actors just happened to be in the studio when the recording was being made. The opening and closing theme, as well as a number of recurring underscore themes from the first season (the \\"Phyllis Coates episodes\\"), were released in 2000 on the CD Adventures of Superman: The Original 1950s TV Series from Varèse Sarabande Records. The liner notes make the point that although series musical arranger Leon Klatzkin is conventionally credited with composing the theme, that credit is in some doubt. The use of the Superman theme in the show became ingrained in viewers' minds because the same section of music was played nearly every time the scene cut to Superman flying. The episodes themselves were tracked with existing \\"library music.\\" One particularly notable instance was a cue called \\"Tumult and Commotion,\\" extracted from Miklos Rozsa's \\"Theme, Variations, and Finale,\\" Op. 13, from 1933. Rozsa was one of Hollywood's leading composers during the 1950s, but he had no involvement in this repurposing of his music. ==Superman (1988 Animated Series)== The 1988 animated series from Ruby-Spears was scored by Ron Jones. Its main titles opened with the John Williams theme from the Christopher Reeve films, then segueing into a similarly-styled original theme by Jones which was used as the primary Superman leitmotif in the episodes' underscores. This short-lived series (13 episodes) was distinctive for its \\"Superman's Family Album\\" vignettes, which each presented an event from some point during Clark Kent's Smallville upbringing. For these mini episodes, Jones continued to follow Williams' lead by employing a Coplandesque Americana sound. Jones' music for this series was released in its entirety on its own CD as part of the 8-disc collection Superman: The Music (1978-1988), issued by Film Score Monthly in 2008. ==Other Music== *The theme for the 1990s series Lois & Clark, starring Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher, was composed by Jay Gruska, the son in-law of John Williams, composer of the score for the 1978 film Superman. This was another dramatic orchestral rendition, with a triad again in evidence, but not so prominently placed in the theme's score. * Smallville, starring Tom Welling, has a vocal, rock-oriented main theme rather than a traditional \\"heroic\\" one. Written by band Remy Zero, the song takes the name \\"Save Me\\", from its chorus. Composer Mark Snow employs traditional orchestral underscore regularly. In several episodes, he has also musically alluded to themes from John Williams' score for the 1978 film Superman. The Williams theme also featured prominently during the series finale's closing moments. *The 1966 series The New Adventures of Superman, produced by Lou Scheimer's and Norm Prescott's Filmation Associates, was scored by John Gart, under the name John Marion. Its main theme was based on a rising four-note motif evocative of previous Superman themes, but jazzier in style. No commercially available recordings of Gart's music were known to exist as of early April 2016. *Shirley Walker's theme for the 1996 Superman: The Animated Series is yet another brassy orchestral piece with a triad-based melody. It was occasionally used as Superman's leitmotif in episodes of Justice League. *When the later Batman: The Animated Series and Superman: The Animated Series were combined to form a \\"new\\" series, The New Batman/Superman Adventures, another new theme was composed by Shirley Walker. *Brandon Routh reprised his role as Superman for the 2019-20 Arrowverse crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths.\\" In the first scene where Clark changes into his Kingdom Come inspired costume, the John Williams theme can be heard. ==References== ===General references=== * Superman: The Music (1978-1988), 2008, liner notes. * Ken Thorne, Film Score Monthly, February 2008, vol. 13, no 2. * Superman: Serial to Cereal, Gary H.

It is found in Bolivia, Brazil and Peru. Lagothrix cana gets its common name, gray woolly monkey, from its thick gray coat. Its hands, feet, face and the inside of the arms are dark in color.Rowe, N. (1996) The Pictorial Guide to the Living Primates. Pogonias Press, Rhode Island. . Two subspecies of Lagothrix cana are known: L. c. cana and L. c. tschudii. L. c. cana is found in both Brazil and Peru and L. c. tschudii is found only in southeastern Peru. An isolated population was discovered by Wallace and Painter in the Madidi National Park in Bolivia. This population is distinctively darker and could soon be a new subspecies. The gray woolly monkey has been considered endangered by IUCN since 2008. The species is listed as endangered because the it suffered a 50% decrease in population over the past 45 years due to deforestation and hunting. ==Habitat== Lagothrix cana or the gray woolly monkey predominantly lives in cloud forest, a type of forest under cloud cover for most of the year. They can be found anywhere from 1,000 to 2,500 metres above sea level. The population of gray woolly monkeys in Bolivia have been reported to be found as low as 700 metres above sea level. They spend the majority of their time high in the tree tops in search of food. They move through the trees using their large prehensile tails, which is a common trait seen in the family Atelidae.Di Fiore, A. and Campbell, C.J. (2007) The atelines: variation in ecology, behavior, and social organization. In: Campbell, C.J., Fuentes, A., MacKinnon, K.C., Panger, M. and Bearder, S.K. (Eds.) Primates in Perspective. Oxford University Press, New York. . They are capable of hanging from their tails and often use them to bridge gaps between trees when travelling in them. ==Diet== The gray woolly monkey predominantly eats fruit, but occasionally when fruit is scarce will eat young leaves and sometimes seeds. ==Groups== Gray woolly monkeys live in groups of 11 to 25 members. These groups are of both mixed ages and sexes. The group will move together and show little aggression towards other groups, and will often share the best feeding spots with other groups. ==Size== In general, males are larger than females. A male's head-body length ranges from 46 to 65 cm in length. A female's head-body length ranges from 46 to 58 cm in length. The tail length of the gray woolly monkey is on average from 66 to 68 cm in length. The male gray woolly monkey weighs an average of 9.5 kg. The female gray woolly monkey weighs an average of 7.7 kg. ==Threats== The main threat the species faces is hunting. They are hunted for food and pets. The females are often targeted for hunting as they are shot and then their offspring are taken and sold as pets. One story from the western Amazon reported several hunters who killed over 200 woolly monkeys in less than two years, which led to their local extinction. Deforestation is another major threat. Mining for cassiterite, a mineral used to make tin, is also a threat for both losing habitat and hunting. ==Conservation== The gray woolly monkey is currently protected in many national parks. They are also listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade of Endagenered Species (CITES).CITES (December, 2011) http://www.cites.org/ The following is a list of protected areas in Brazil where the gray woolly monkey occurs or may occur. *Amazonia National Park *Mapinguari National Park *Abufari Biological Reserve *Jaru Biological Reserve *Iquê Ecological Station *Rio Acre Ecological Station *Cuniã Ecological Station *Jatuarana National Forest *Macauá National Forest *São Francisco National Forest *Santa Rosa do Purus National Forest *Humaita National Forest *Jamari National Forest *Bom Futuro National Forest *Purus National Forest *Mapiá-Inauini National Forest *Pau Rosa National Forest *Tefe National Forest The entire known population of these monkeys in Bolivia are found in the Apolobamba Natural Area of Integrated Management and the Madidi National Park and Natural Area of Integrated Management. ==References== gray woolly monkey Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Mammals of Peru Category:Mammals of Bolivia gray woolly monkey ","title":"Gray woolly monkey"},{"id":"3242411","text":"Ray Barbee (born October 5, 1971) is an American skateboarder, photographer, and musician from San Jose, California.

The regime that immediately resulted from the coup, the Ditadura Nacional (National Dictatorship), would be later refashioned into the Estado Novo (New State), which in turn would last until the Carnation Revolution in 1974. == Background == The chronic political instability and government's neglect of the army created opportunities for military plots. Most historians consider that the coup had vast support, including all political groups except for the Democratic Party, Portuguese Communist Party, Socialist Party, the Seara Nova group, General Confederation of Labour, and the Democratic Leftwing Republican Party. Already in 1925 there were three failed coup attempts: on 5 March (led by Filomeno da Câmara), 18 April (inspired by Sinel de Cordes and led by Raul Esteves and Filomeno da Câmara) and 19 July (led by Mendes Cabeçadas). The plotters were mostly acquitted by military court. Óscar Carmona, acting as military prosecutor of the 18 April plot, asked that the plotters be absolved. During the trial, Óscar Carmona famously asked: > \\"Why do these men sit in the defendant bench? Because their homeland is sick > and orders its best sons to be judged and tried.\\" - Óscar Carmona The leaders of the 18 April plot were sent to the Nossa Senhora da Graça Fort, in which they took the opportunity to further the plot, adding the Fort's commander, Passos e Sousa, to the rebel forces. The officers decided on General Manuel de Oliveira Gomes da Costa to lead the movement, who agreed to join the plotters on 25 May.Tom Gallagher, Portugal: A Twentieth-century Interpretation, 1983, p. 62. On 27 May, General Manuel de Oliveira Gomes da Costa arrived at Braga with the purpose of initiating a coup d'état. The First Portuguese Republic and Prime Minister António Maria da Silva, knowing of the forthcoming coup, tried to organize resistance -- believing an eventual coup d'état could be defeated. == Coup == The revolution started in Braga, commanded by General Manuel Gomes da Costa, followed immediately in Porto, Lisbon, Évora, Coimbra and Santarém. Generals Sinel de Cordes, Filomeno da Câmara, Passos e Sousa, and Raul Esteves also took part in the coup, leading the provincial military forces. Initially believing he failed, Gomes da Costa announced his surrender. ==Aftermath== On 30 May, President Bernardino Machado appoints José Mendes Cabeçadas as head of government and minister of every ministry and on the following day transfers his powers, as president, to Cabeçadas. On 6 June, General Gomes da Costa marched on Lisbon's Avenida da Liberdade along with 15,000 men, being acclaimed by the people of the city. Five days later, on 11 June, Cabeçadas' units in Santarém demobilize. On 17 June, Gomes da Costa mobilizes his units and demands Cabeçadas' resignation. Cabeçada does resign and transfers his powers to Gomes da Costa. Gomes da Costa then tries to get the ministers associated with Sinel de Cordes to resign. Yet, on 8 June a group of generals and colonels try to get Gomes da Costa to accept a formal position of President, but he declines and is imprisoned on the following day. Two days later he is deported to the Azores. General Óscar Carmona is appointed head of government and the Ditadura Nacional begins. == Timeline == *29 May: **The Portuguese Communist Party interrupted its Second Congress due to the political and military situation in the country. **The Confederação Geral do Trabalho (General Confederation of Labour) declared its neutrality in all military confrontations. **The 28.5.26 coup d'état spread to the rest of the country -- influenced Mendes Cabeçadas, Sinel de Cordes and Óscar Carmona -- and established the Ditadura Militar (National Military Dictatorship) against the democratic but unstable First Portuguese Republic. **The Government of Prime Minister António Maria da Silva resigned. *30 May: **The General Gomes da Costa was acclaimed in Porto. **The president of the republic, Bernardino Machado, resigned. **José Mendes Cabeçadas Júnior became Prime Minister and President of the Republic. *3 June: António de Oliveira Salazar became Minister of Finance; however, he resigned 16 days after. *3 June: A dictatorial decree dissolved the Congress of the Republic of Portugal (National Assembly). *In addition, by dictatorial decree, the leaders of all the Municipalities were sacked. *The Ditadura Militar banned the Carbonária. *The Ditadura Militar banned all Political parties. *17 June: General Gomes da Costa provoked a second coup d'état. *19 June: General Gomes da Costa became Prime Minister. *22 June: The Ditadura Militar instituted Censorship. *29 June: General Gomes da Costa became President of the Republic. *9 July: **The Ditadura Militar forced General Gomes da Costa to resign -- allowing him to go into exile. **General António Óscar de Fragoso Carmona, of the conservative military wing of the Ditadura Militar, became Prime Minister. *15 September: A military coup d'état failed. *18 September: Another military coup d'état failed. *29 November: General António Óscar Carmona became President of the Republic. *16 December: The Ditadura Militar created a political police called Police of Information of Lisbon. ==References== 1926 Coup D Etat Category:1926 in Portugal Category:Conflicts in 1926 Coup d'état 1926 Coup d'état 1926 1926 Coup d'état 1926 Coup d'état Coup d'état 1926 Category:May 1926 events Category:1920s coups d'état and coup attempts ","title":"28 May 1926 coup d'état"},{"id":"3242420","text":"The silvery woolly monkey (Lagothrix poeppigii), also known as Poeppig's woolly monkey, is a woolly monkey species from South America.

The Special Night Squads (SNS) (Hebrew: Plugot Ha'Layla Ha'Meyukhadot, פלוגות הלילה המיוחדות) were a joint British- Jewish counter-insurgency unit, established by Captain Orde Wingate in Mandatory Palestine in 1938, during the 1936-1939 Arab revolt. The SNS basically comprised British infantry soldiers, together with some men drawn from the Jewish Supernumerary Police, and total unit strength was 100 by 1938.Daniel Marston, Carter Malkasian, Counterinsurgency in Modern Warfare, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2011 p.33 Wingate selected his men personally, among them Yigal Allon and Moshe Dayan, and trained them to form small mobile striking units. Wingate also collaborated with the Jewish paramilitary formation, the Haganah, reinforcing his unit with some of Haganah's Fosh commandos.Oring, 1981, p. 13. Given British opposition to the formal creation of Jewish military units, it is not clear to what degree the authorities were aware of the exact details of Wingate's operations in this regard. ==Creation and Deployment== The origins of night squads has been discerned in the creation of specialized units in both the northern frontier of India, where Gurkhas were trained to control indigenous insurgents after WW1, and to similar military structures, such as the Black and Tans deployed in Ireland to repress the Irish War of Independence.Simon Anglim,Orde Wingate and the British Army, 1922-1944, Routledge, 2015 p.37. Wingate, an intelligence officer of the British army's General Headquarters (GHQ) in Jerusalem, examined sabotage and weapon smuggling operations in northern Palestine (Galilee). During March 1938, after several weeks of experimental ambushes and patrols, he had gained permission from the British General Officer Commanding (GOC), Lieutenant-General Archibald Wavell, to establish a joint British- Jewish unit for night operations against the Arab insurgents.Rankin, 2009, p. 184. However, the Jewish Agency had opposed this venture at first, resulting in its postponement until early June. The new British GOC, Lieutenant-General Robert Haining, had also approved Wingate's proposal to establish a \\"Night Movement Group\\", and the SNS became operative on early June, 1938. The military historian Hew Strachan has described the tactics Wingate employed with the blessing of British authorities as a form of state terrorism, and its mode of operation eventually to lead to allegations that Wingate had effectively organized these nights squads into Jewish 'murder gangs' or 'death squads'.John Newsinger, British Counterinsurgency,'' Springer 2016 p.6.Simon Anglim,Orde Wingate and the British Army, 1922-1944, Routledge, 2015 pp.59-60. The British 16th Brigade, under Brigadier John Fullerton Evetts, supplied three twelve-man squads including officers, to the new unit. The men were taken from the Royal Ulster Rifles (squad commanded by Lieutenant Bala Bredin), the Royal West Kent Regiment (Lt. Michael \\"Mike\\" Grove) and the Manchester Regiment (commanded by Lt. Robert King-Clark).King-Clark, R. Free for a Blast 1988 pp145-204 with photos 25 Jews were assigned to the unit as supernumerary policemen, all of them Haganah members. The Jews were selected by Haganah regional commanders and by Yitzhak Sadeh, commander of the FOSH units in the Haganah. Later, 50 more Jews were assigned to the SNS, also from Haganah cadres. Members of the Special Night Squads, possibly in Kfar Tavor. The success of the SNS caused the establishment of a fourth SNS-like unit in the Plain of Sharon, tasked with guarding the electric power line. During 1939 every British brigade in Palestine established its own Special Night Squads, although without Jewish participation. Wingate left the SNS in October 1938, for a leave in England. During his leave he was involved with the Zionist opposition to the Woodhead Commission report, meeting with such notables as Malcolm MacDonald, then secretary of the colonies, Beaverbrook and Churchill. This was frowned upon by Wingate's commanders, who dismissed him from command of the SNS and returned him to GHQ intelligence during November 1938. Bredin replaced Wingate as commander of the SNS, until it was disbanded. The SNS continued to operate in the original form until January 1939 when, due to British policy change, the Jewish supernumeraries were forbidden from participating with offensive operations. Thereafter, the Jewish SNS served mainly on prison guard and garrison duties. They were disbanded during September 1939. The British eventually considered Wingate to be a security risk. He was posted out of the country and his passport was stamped \\"NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER PALESTINE\\".Goodspeed, 2001, p. 96. ==Operational Activities== The Special Night Squads' primary task was to defend the Iraq Petroleum Company pipeline, which was frequently attacked by Arab insurgents. The squads also raided known insurgent bases, such as the villages of Daburiyya and Khirbat Lid. The force's success caused the cessation of attacks on the pipeline and brought a decrease of insurgent activity in the area. It is presumed that about 12.5% of all guerrilla casualties during 1938 were caused by the SNS, which had lost only two of its men (Pvt. Stephen Chapman from the Royal West Kents and supernumerary Yosef Ben-Moshe) in action. According to Israeli military historian Martin van Creveld, their training included \\"... how to kill without compunction, how to interrogate prisoners by shooting every tenth man to make the rest talk; and how to deter future terrorists by pushing the heads of captured ones into pools of oil and then freeing them to tell the story\\".van Creveld, 2004, p. 46. ==Recognition== For its actions, Wingate was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), and his three British officers were awarded the Military Cross (MC). Several soldiers and supernumeraries were also awarded medals and citations. The Special Night Squads came to be considered the British army's first special forces and the forerunners of the Special Air Service regiments.Brown and Louis, 1999, p. 193. ==Criticism== Yoram Kaniuk writes: > The operations came more frequently and became more ruthless. The Arabs > complained to the British about Wingate's brutality and harsh punitive > methods. Even members of the field squads complained... that during the > raids on Bedouin encampments Wingate would behave with extreme viciousness > and fire mercilessly. Wingate believed in the principle of surprise in > punishment, which was designed to confine the gangs to their villages. More > than once he had lined rioters up in a row and shot them in cold blood. > Wingate did not try to justify himself; weapons and war cannot be > pure.Kaniuk, 2001, p. 19. Field Marshal Montgomery, who as commander of northern Palestine had authorized the SNS, told Moshe Dayan during 1966 that he considered Wingate to have \\"been mentally unbalanced and that the best thing he ever did was to get killed in a plane crash in 1944.\\"van Creveld, 2004, p. 115. ==See also== ==Footnotes== ==References== *Brown, Judith and Louis, Roger (1999).

This accent is revealed by the name \\"Yon Yonson\\", which when recited in American English is usually rendered \\"Jan Jansen\\" or \\"John Johnson\\". The Swedish pronunciation \\"Yon Yonson\\" probably dates the origin of the song to soon after the Swedes' arrival in the United States. A possible origin of the song is the dialect stage comedy Yon Yonson by Gus Heege and W. D. Coxey (1890).Anne- Charlotte Harvey, \\"Swedish Theater\\", in Philip J.

Excerpts available at Google Books. The play's setting included a Minnesota lumber camp. However, no evidence shows that the song was actually performed as part of the play. == Lyrics == One version of the song Numerous versions of the song exist, but all are similar to the following: :My name is Yon Yonson, :I live in Wisconsin. :I work in a lumber yard there. :The people I meet as :I walk down the street, :They say \\"Hello!\\" :I say \\"Hello!\\" :They say \\"What's your name.\\" :I say: My name is Yon Yonson...

There are at least five subspecies. Some primatologists classify the black-headed spider monkey (A. fusciceps), found in Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador as the same species as Geoffroy's spider monkey. It is one of the largest New World monkeys, often weighing as much as . Its arms are significantly longer than its legs, and its prehensile tail can support the entire weight of the monkey and is used as an extra limb. Its hands have only a vestigial thumb, but long, strong, hook-like fingers. These adaptations allow the monkey to move by swinging by its arms beneath the tree branches. Geoffroy's spider monkey lives in fission–fusion societies that contain between 20 and 42 members. Its diet consists primarily of ripe fruit and it requires large tracts of forest to survive. As a result of habitat loss, hunting and capture for the pet trade, it is considered to be endangered by the IUCN. == Taxonomy == Wild Nicaraguan spider monkeys (A. g. geoffroyi), Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica Geoffroy's spider monkey belongs to the New World monkey family Atelidae, which contains the spider monkeys, woolly monkeys, muriquis and howler monkeys. It is a member of the subfamily Atelinae, which includes the spider monkeys, woolly monkeys and muriquis, and of the genus Ateles, which contains all the spider monkeys. The genus name Ateles means \\"imperfect\\", a reference to the vestigial thumb. The species name geoffroyi is in honor of French naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. Agreement over the number of spider monkey species is not universal. Kellogg and Goldman (1944) based their classification on fur color, and Groves (1989) based his on fur color and geographic distribution. Kellogg and Goldman differentiated Geoffroy's spider monkey from other species by its dark black head, hands and wrists. Recent studies use mitochondrial DNA to help differentiate species. Such studies by Collins and Daubach (2000, 2001, 2006) indicate the Geoffroy's spider monkey is more closely related to the white- fronted spider monkey, A. belzebuth, and the brown spider monkey, A. hybridus, than it is to the red-faced spider monkey, A. paniscus. According to these studies, A. paniscus branched off from the other spider monkeys approximately 3.27 million years ago and the spider monkeys branched off from the woolly monkeys and muiriquis 3.59 million years ago. Older studies by Porter, et al. indicate the howler monkeys are believed to have branched off from the other Atelides over 10 million years ago. ==Subspecies== At least five subspecies of this monkey are recognized: * Nicaraguan spider monkey, Ateles geoffroyi geoffroyi * Hooded spider monkey, A. g. grisescens * Ornate spider monkey, A. g. ornatus * Mexican spider monkey, A. g. vellerosus * Yucatan spider monkey, A. g. yucatanensis Some authorities also recognize A. g. azuerensis and A. g. frontatus as valid subspecies. The black-headed spider monkey, Ateles fusciceps, is considered by authorities such as Groves (1989) and Rylands et al. (2006) to be a separate species from Geoffroy's spider monkey. Other authorities, including Froelich (1991), Collins and Dubach (2001) and Nieves (2005), consider A. fusciceps to be synonymous with A. geoffroyi. Under this treatment, the two subspecies of the black-headed spider monkey represent additional subspecies of Geoffroy's spider monkey, A. g. fusciceps and A. g. rufiventris. == Distribution and habitat == The range of this species extends over much of Central America, encompassing Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Belize and the south and much of the eastern portion of Mexico. Observations by local people indicate the southernmost subspecies, the hooded spider monkey, A. g. grisescens, may also occur in the portion of Colombia near the Panama border. In western Colombia and northeast Panama, it is replaced by the black-headed spider monkey, A. fusciceps, which is considered by some primatologists to be a subspecies of Geoffroy's spider monkey. Geoffroy's spider monkey lives in various types of forest, including rainforest, semideciduous and mangrove forests. Higher densities of Geoffroy's spider monkeys are generally found in areas containing evergreen forest. == Physical description == Geoffroy's spider monkey is one of the largest New World monkeys. Its length measures between and it weighs between . The tail is longer than the body at between . Males and females are approximately the same size. In Belize Zoo Using its prehensile tail near Tortuguero, Costa Rica Its body color varies by subspecies and population, and can be buff, reddish, rust, brown or black. The hands and feet are dark or black. The face usually has a pale mask and bare skin around the eyes and muzzle. Its arms and legs are long and slim. The arms are about 25% longer than the legs. The thumb is only vestigial, but the fingers are long and strong, making the hands hook- like. The long arms and hook-like hands allow Geoffroy's spider monkey to brachiate, that is, swing by its arms beneath the tree branches. The prehensile tail is very strong and has a palm-like pad at the end. The tail acts as an extra limb, and is used for locomotion, as well as to pick fruits and to scoop water from holes in trees. Geoffroy's spider monkey can support its weight suspended by its tail and often does so when feeding. The clitoris of female Geoffroy's spider monkeys is large and protrudes, looking like a penis. This organ, called a pendulous clitoris because of the way it dangles externally, is actually larger than the male flaccid penis. As a result, females are sometimes mistaken for males by human observers. The enlarged clitoris is believed to aid males in determining sexual receptiveness, allowing them to touch the clitoris and smell their fingers to pick up chemical or olfactory cues to the female's reproductive status. == Behavior == Thumbless hands are useful for brachiation Geoffroy's spider monkey is arboreal and diurnal, and mostly inhabits the upper portion of the forest. However, it comes to the ground more frequently than other spider monkey species. It lives in fission–fusion societies, large groups with a typical 20 to 42 members, which split into smaller subgroups to forage during the day. Subgroups typically number two to six members, and sometimes the subgroups remain separate from the main group even through the night. Geoffroy's spider monkey forages over large tracts of forest in search of food. Home ranges for groups can exceed . Monkeys can range about each day. Males tend to cover a larger day range than females, and dominant individuals tend to have larger day ranges. Geoffroy's spider monkey sometimes rubs a mixture of saliva and ground lime tree Citrus aurantifolia leaves on its fur. This is believed to act as an insect repellent. In some locations, Geoffroy's spider monkey interacts with the white-headed capuchin. These interactions can include mutual grooming. In addition to walking or running on four limbs and climbing, Geoffroy's spider monkey uses several forms of suspensory locomotion. Brachiation, or swinging from the arms with assistance from the prehensile tail, is the most common form of suspensory locomotion. Less common forms include swinging while suspended by the tail, and walking on four limbs under a branch. Studies have indicated the Geoffroy's spider monkey uses suspensory locomotion less frequently than other spider monkey species. Captive Geoffroy's spider monkeys in Ueno Zoo, Japan (video) The most common method used by spider monkeys to cross between trees is \\"bridging\\", in which the monkey grasps for a branch from the new tree and pulls it towards itself so it can climb onto it. Airborne leaps are used when necessary, and certain populations of Geoffroy's spider monkey, especially in Panama, are known to leap between trees more frequently than other populations. When not moving, Geoffroy's spider monkey uses not only supported postures, such as sitting or standing, but also suspended postures in which it hangs from a branch. Suspended postures always include support from the tail, and sometimes the monkey hangs by its tail alone. Other times it hangs by the tail and by one or more limbs simultaneously. Studies have indicated at least some Geoffroy's spider monkey populations use suspended postures less frequently when feeding than other spider monkey species. === Communication and intelligence === Sounds produced by Geoffroy's spider monkey include barks, whinnies, squeals, squeaks and screams. Barks are typically alarm calls. Whinnies and screams can be used as distress calls, and are also made at dawn and at dusk. Each monkey makes a unique sound, which may allow monkeys to recognize each other through vocal communication alone. Several researchers have investigated the use of whinnies, which consist of between two and 12 quick increases and decreases in pitch, in more detail. This research has indicated one additional purpose of whinnies is to call other group members to a food source. Other purposes of whinnies suggested by this research have included maintaining vocal contact with other group members while traveling and distinguishing between group members and members of other groups. Geoffroy's spider monkey uses several forms of nonvocal communication. A curled tail or arched back can be used as a threat display towards other spider monkeys. A head shake is used either as a threat or an invitation to play. Shaking branches or swaying arms is used as a warning of danger to the group. Although they do not use tools, spider monkeys, including Geoffroy's spider monkey, are regarded as intelligent primates. A study performed in 2007 concluded they were the third most intelligent nonhuman primate, behind only orangutans and chimpanzees, and ahead of gorillas and all other monkeys. This mental capacity may be an adaptation to spider monkeys' frugivorous diets, which require them to be able to identify and memorize many different types of foods and their locations. === Diet === Prehensile tail can be useful when feeding Geoffroy's spider monkey eats mostly fruit – preferably ripe and fleshy – and spends 70% to 80% of its feeding time eating fruit. Leaves make up most of the rest of its diet. Young leaves are especially important to provide the protein that can be lacking in fruit. Other elements of its diet include flowers, bark, insects, honey, seeds and buds. In addition to providing much of the monkey's nutritional needs, fruit and leaves provide much of its water requirements. Like other spider monkeys, Geoffroy's spider monkey drinks water from tree holes and bromeliads in trees, but unlike other spider monkeys, it also drinks from terrestrial water sources. === Predators === Large cats – jaguars and pumas – appear to be the only significant adult spider monkey predators, other than humans. Eagles and large snakes are also potential predators. However, predation of Geoffroy's spider monkey has not been observed by researchers. === Reproduction === Females bear young every two to four years. Among males, mating is not restricted to only dominant individuals. In one study at Barro Colorado Island, all males in the group were observed mating at least once over a one-year period. However, dominant males appear to mate more often than low-ranking males. It is unknown whether male dominance is correlated with greater success in fathering offspring. Geoffroy's spider monkeys mate in a sitting position, both facing the same direction, with the male seated behind the female and his arms wrapped around her chest and legs wrapped around her waist. This embrace can last between 8 and 22 minutes. Prior to mating, the male and female both separate themselves from the rest of the group, so they are alone except for any of the female's juvenile offspring. The gestational period is about 7.5 months, after which a single young is typically born, although twins sometimes occur. The young are dark in color until they begin taking on the adult coloration at the age of five months. They are carried on their mothers' chests for the first month and a half to two months, at which point they can ride on their backs. They nurse until they are about one year old, but begin eating solid foods and moving independently at about three months. Even when they move independently, they cannot always cross gaps in the canopy that adults can manage. To help them, an adult will stretch across the gap, forming a bridge over which the young can cross. Females become sexually mature at about four years, and males at about five years. Upon reaching sexual maturity, females leave their natal group, but males do not. As a result, the males in the groups are typically related, while the females are not. This may help explain why male Geoffroy's spider monkeys form strong bonds. Maximum life span in the wild is unknown. In captivity, Geoffroy's spider monkey can live at least 33 years. == Conservation status == Geoffroy's spider monkey is listed as \\"Endangered\\" by the IUCN, mostly due to habitat loss. It requires large tracts of primary forest to survive, so it is vulnerable to deforestation and is sometimes hunted by humans and captured for the pet trade. Because of its low reproductive turnover, it cannot quickly replenish its numbers when affected by these events. As a result, Geoffroy's spider monkey has disappeared from some areas where it was once common. Three subspecies are critically endangered. Geoffroy's spider monkey was extirpated on Barro Colorado Island in Panama. Hunting had eliminated the native population there by 1912. However, between 1959 and 1966, an effort was made to reintroduce the species to Barro Colorado. At least 18 monkeys were reintroduced, but only five, one male and four females, survived the reintroduction. This small group has thrived, and the island population had grown to 28 monkeys by 2003. == In culture == The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo's Self-Portrait with Monkey 1938 portrays this species; the artist kept several of them as pets. == References == == External links == * ARKive – images and movies of the black-handed spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) Geoffroy's spider monkey Category:Mammals of Mexico Category:Primates of Central America Category:Mammals of Colombia Category:Endangered fauna of North America Category:Endangered fauna of South America Category:Endangered biota of Mexico Geoffroy's spider monkey Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Geoffroy's spider monkey"},{"id":"3242434","text":"thumbupright=1.4Diagram of the eye, the retina, and location of the various retinal implants. Retinal layers, from bottom to top: retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), photoreceptors (PR), horizontal cells (HC), bipolar cells (BC), amacrine cells (AC), ganglion cells (RGC), nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Retinal prostheses for restoration of sight to patients blinded by retinal degeneration are being developed by a number of private companies and research institutions worldwide. The system is meant to partially restore useful vision to people who have lost their photoreceptors due to retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) or age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Three types of retinal implants are currently in clinical trials: epiretinal (on the retina), subretinal (behind the retina), and suprachoroidal (between the choroid and the sclera). Retinal implants introduce visual information into the retina by electrically stimulating the surviving retinal neurons. So far, elicited percepts had rather low resolution, and may be suitable for light perception and recognition of simple objects. ==History== Foerster was the first to discover that electrical stimulation of the occipital cortex could be used to create visual percepts, phosphenes. The first application of an implantable stimulator for vision restoration was developed by Drs. Brindley and Lewin in 1968. This experiment demonstrated the viability of creating visual percepts using direct electrical stimulation, and it motivated the development of several other implantable devices for stimulation of the visual pathway, including retinal implants. Retinal stimulation devices, in particular, have become a focus of research as approximately half of all cases of blindness are caused by retinal damage. The development of retinal implants has also been motivated in part by the advancement and success of cochlear implants, which has demonstrated that humans can regain significant sensory function with limited input. The Argus II retinal implant, manufactured by Second Sight Medical Products received market approval in the US in Feb 2013 and in Europe in Feb 2011, becoming the first approved implant. The device may help adults with RP who have lost the ability to perceive shapes and movement to be more mobile and to perform day-to-day activities. The epiretinal device is known as the Retina Implant and was originally developed in Germany by Retina Implant AG. It completed a multi-centre clinical trial in Europe and was awarded a CE Mark in 2013, making it the first wireless epiretinal electronic device to gain approval. ==Candidates== Optimal candidates for retinal implants have retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa or age- related macular degeneration. These diseases cause blindness by affecting the photoreceptor cells in the outer layer of the retina, while leaving the inner and middle retinal layers intact. Minimally, a patient must have an intact ganglion cell layer in order to be a candidate for a retinal implant. This can be assessed non-invasively using optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Other factors, including the amount of residual vision, overall health, and family commitment to rehabilitation, are also considered when determining candidates for retinal implants. In subjects with age-related macular degeneration, who may have intact peripheral vision, retinal implants could result in a hybrid form of vision. In this case the implant would supplement the remaining peripheral vision with central vision information. ==Types== There are two main types of retinal implants by placement. Epiretinal implants are placed in the internal surface of the retina, while subretinal implants are placed between the outer retinal layer and the retinal pigment epithelium. ===Epiretinal implants=== ====Design principles==== Epiretinal implants are placed on top of the retinal surface, above the nerve fiber layer, directly stimulating ganglion cells and bypassing all other retinal layers. Array of electrodes is stabilized on the retina using micro tacks which penetrate into the sclera. Typically, external video camera onto eyeglasses acquires images and transmits processed video information to the stimulating electrodes via wireless telemetry. An external transmitter is also required to provide power to the implant via radio-frequency induction coils or infrared lasers. The real-time image processing involves reducing the resolution, enhancing contrast, detecting the edges in the image and converting it into a spatio- temporal pattern of stimulation delivered to the electrode array on the retina. The majority of electronics can be incorporated into the associated external components, allowing for a smaller implant and simpler upgrades without additional surgery. The external electronics provides full control over the image processing for each patient. ====Advantages==== Epiretinal implants directly stimulate the retinal ganglion cells, thereby bypassing all other retinal layers. Therefore, in principle, epiretinal implants could provide visual perception to individuals even if all other retinal layers have been damaged. ====Disadvantages==== Since the nerve fiber layer has similar stimulation threshold to that of the retinal ganglion cells, axons passing under the epiretinal electrodes are stimulated, creating arcuate percepts, and thereby distorting the retinotopic map. So far, none of the epiretinal implants had light-sensitive pixels, and hence they rely on external camera for capturing the visual information. Therefore, unlike natural vision, eye movements do not shift the transmitted image on the retina, which creates a perception of the moving object when person with such an implant changes the direction of gaze. Therefore, patients with such implants are asked to not move their eyes, but rather scan the visual field with their head. Additionally, encoding visual information at the ganglion cell layer requires very sophisticated image processing techniques in order to account for various types of the retinal ganglion cells encoding different features of the image. ====Clinical study==== The first epiretinal implant, the ARGUS device, included a silicon platinum array with 16 electrodes. The Phase I clinical trial of ARGUS began in 2002 by implanting six participants with the device. All patients reported gaining a perception of light and discrete phosphenes, with the visual function of some patients improving significantly over time. Future versions of the ARGUS device are being developed with increasingly dense electrode arrays, allowing for improved spatial resolution. The most recent ARGUS II device contains 60 electrodes, and a 200 electrode device is under development by ophthalmologists and engineers at the USC Eye Institute. The ARGUS II device received marketing approval in February 2011 (CE Mark demonstrating safety and performance), and it is available in Germany, France, Italy, and UK. Interim results on 30 patients long term trials were published in Ophthalmology in 2012. Argus II received approval from the US FDA on April 14, 2013 FDA Approval. Another epiretinal device, the Learning Retinal Implant, has been developed by IIP technologies GmbH, and has begun to be evaluated in clinical trials. A third epiretinal device, EPI-RET, has been developed and progressed to clinical testing in six patients. The EPI-RET device contains 25 electrodes and requires the crystalline lens to be replaced with a receiver chip. All subjects have demonstrated the ability to discriminate between different spatial and temporal patterns of stimulation. \\\\---- ===Subretinal implants=== ====Design principles==== Subretinal implants sit on the outer surface of the retina, between the photoreceptor layer and the retinal pigment epithelium, directly stimulating retinal cells and relying on the normal processing of the inner and middle retinal layers. Adhering a subretinal implant in place is relatively simple, as the implant is mechanically constrained by the minimal distance between the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. A subretinal implant consists of a silicon wafer containing light sensitive microphotodiodes, which generate signals directly from the incoming light. Incident light passing through the retina generates currents within the microphotodiodes, which directly inject the resultant current into the underlying retinal cells via arrays of microelectrodes. The pattern of microphotodiodes activated by incident light therefore stimulates a pattern of bipolar, horizontal, amacrine, and ganglion cells, leading to a visual perception representative of the original incident image. In principle, subretinal implants do not require any external hardware beyond the implanted microphotodiodes array. However, some subretinal implants require power from external circuitry to enhance the image signal. ====Advantages==== A subretinal implant is advantageous over an epiretinal implant in part because of its simpler design. The light acquisition, processing, and stimulation are all carried out by microphotodiodes mounted onto a single chip, as opposed to the external camera, processing chip, and implanted electrode array associated with an epiretinal implant. The subretinal placement is also more straightforward, as it places the stimulating array directly adjacent to the damaged photoreceptors. By relying on the function of the remaining retinal layers, subretinal implants allow for normal inner retinal processing, including amplification, thus resulting in an overall lower threshold for a visual response. Additionally, subretinal implants enable subjects to use normal eye movements to shift their gaze. The retinotopic stimulation from subretinal implants is inherently more accurate, as the pattern of incident light on the microphotodiodes is a direct reflection of the desired image. Subretinal implants require minimal fixation, as the subretinal space is mechanically constrained and the retinal pigment epithelium creates negative pressure within the subretinal space. ====Disadvantages==== The main disadvantage of subretinal implants is the lack of sufficient incident light to enable the microphotodiodes to generate adequate current. Thus, subretinal implants often incorporate an external power source to amplify the effect of incident light. The compact nature of the subretinal space imposes significant size constraints on the implant. The close proximity between the implant and the retina also increases the possibility of thermal damage to the retina from heat generated by the implant. Subretinal implants require intact inner and middle retinal layers, and therefore are not beneficial for retinal diseases extending beyond the outer photoreceptor layer. Additionally, photoreceptor loss can result in the formation of a membrane at the boundary of the damaged photoreceptors, which can impede stimulation and increase the stimulation threshold. ====Clinical studies==== Optobionics was the first company to develop a subretinal implant and evaluate the design in a clinical trial. Initial reports indicated that the implantation procedure was safe, and all subjects reported some perception of light and mild improvement in visual function. The current version of this device has been implanted in 10 patients, who have each reported improvements in the perception of visual details, including contrast, shape, and movement. Retina Implant AG in Germany has also developed a subretinal implant, which has undergone clinical testing in nine patients. Trial was put on hold due to repeated failures. The Retina Implant AG device contains 1500 microphotodiodes, allowing for increased spatial resolution, but requires an external power source. Retina implant AG reported 12 months results on the Alpha IMS study in Feb 2013 showing that six out of nine patients had a device failure in the nine months post implant Proceedings of the royal society B, and that five of the eight subjects reported various implant-mediated visual perceptions in daily life. One had optic nerve damage and did not perceive stimulation. The Boston Subretinal Implant Project has also developed several iterations of a functional subretinal implant, and focused on short term analysis of implant function. Results from all clinical trials to date indicate that patients receiving subretinal implants report perception of phosphenes, with some gaining the ability to perform basic visual tasks, such as shape recognition and motion detection. ==Spatial resolution== The quality of vision expected from a retinal implant is largely based on the maximum spatial resolution of the implant. Current prototypes of retinal implants are capable of providing low resolution, pixelated images. \\"State-of-the-art\\" retinal implants incorporate 60-100 channels, sufficient for basic object discrimination and recognition tasks. However, simulations of the resultant pixelated images assume that all electrodes on the implant are in contact with the desired retinal cell; in reality the expected spatial resolution is lower, as a few of the electrodes may not function optimally. Tests of reading performance indicated that a 60-channel implant is sufficient to restore some reading ability, but only with significantly enlarged text. Similar experiments evaluating room navigation ability with pixelated images demonstrated that 60 channels were sufficient for experienced subjects, while naïve subjects required 256 channels. This experiment, therefore, not only demonstrated the functionality provided by low resolution visual feedback, but also the ability for subjects to adapt and improve over time. However, these experiments are based merely on simulations of low resolution vision in normal subjects, rather than clinical testing of implanted subjects. The number of electrodes necessary for reading or room navigation may differ in implanted subjects, and further testing needs to be conducted within this clinical population to determine the required spatial resolution for specific visual tasks. Simulation results indicate that 600-1000 electrodes would be required to enable subjects to perform a wide variety of tasks, including reading, face recognition, and navigating around rooms. Thus, the available spatial resolution of retinal implants needs to increase by a factor of 10, while remaining small enough to implant, to restore sufficient visual function for those tasks. It is worth to note high-density stimulation is not equal to high visual acuity (resolution), which requires a lot of factors in both hardware (electrodes and coatings) and software (stimulation strategies based on surgical results). ==Current status and future developments== Clinical reports to date have demonstrated mixed success, with all patients report at least some sensation of light from the electrodes, and a smaller proportion gaining more detailed visual function, such as identifying patterns of light and dark areas. The clinical reports indicate that, even with low resolution, retinal implants are potentially useful in providing crude vision to individuals who otherwise would not have any visual sensation. However, clinical testing in implanted subjects is somewhat limited and the majority of spatial resolution simulation experiments have been conducted in normal controls. It remains unclear whether the low level vision provided by current retinal implants is sufficient to balance the risks associated with the surgical procedure, especially for subjects with intact peripheral vision. Several other aspects of retinal implants need to be addressed in future research, including the long term stability of the implants and the possibility of retinal neuron plasticity in response to prolonged stimulation. The Manchester Royal Infirmary and Prof Paulo E Stanga announced on July 22, 2015 the first successful implantation of Second Sight's Argus II in patients suffering from severe Age Related Macular Degeneration.Article in TimesBBC These results are very impressive as it appears that the patients integrate the residual vision and the artificial vision. It potentially opens the use of retinal implants to millions of patients suffering from AMD. ==See also== *Retinal regeneration ==References== ==External links== *Japan Retinal Implant Project * - The Retinal Implant Project - rle.mit.edu *National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Heath (NIH) Category:Biomedical engineering Category:Neuroprosthetics Category:Implants (medicine) Category:Artificial organs Category:Emerging technologies Category:Blindness Category:Eye Category:Prosthetics Category:Medical devices ","title":"Retinal implant"},{"id":"3242436","text":"Church is a large village in Hyndburn, Lancashire, England, situated a mile west of Accrington.

Tinker Brook, up to Foxhill Bank, formed the boundary with Oswaldtwistle in the south and Bottom Syke from Dunkenhalgh, the boundary with Clayton-le-Moors to the north. This became a civil parish in 1866. The parish church is the medieval Church of St James. The tower dates to the late medieval era, and was damaged by a fire in 1983. The nave was constructed in 1805. Edward Ormerod or Ormrod (1834-1894) was born in the village of Church. He was the inventor in 1867 of the patent Ormerod Butterfly Clip, which has been responsible for saving the lives of generations of coal miners. The main road running through the village is the A679. The local travel links are located less than a mile from the village centre to Church and Oswaldtwistle railway station and to Blackpool Airport. Church is the halfway point on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. ==Governance== Prior to 1894 Church had a civil parish, and between 1894 and 1974 the area was administered by an Urban District. It has since become an unparished part of the borough of Hyndburn. ==Economy and amenities== Church is a large village with a wealth of amenities, including a supermarket, bakery, bookmaker, sports centre, a fire station and a car sales garage. Another car sales garage was closed down and demolished in 2015, making way for a restaurant.

(January 6, 1933 – April 11, 2016) was an American business executive. He was the chairman of Comcast Spectacor, a Philadelphia-based sports and entertainment company that owns the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League; the Wells Fargo Center; the regional sports network Comcast SportsNet; and Global Spectrum, an international facilities management company. He formerly owned the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association, and was part- owner of the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League. ==Early life and education== Snider was born to a Jewish family in the Washington, D.C. region, the son of a grocery-store chain owner.John Corr,\\"Ed Snider: A Nice Guy Who Finished First\\", Philadelphia Inquirer, May 6, 1986. He attended the University of Maryland and earned his bachelor's degree.Profile, Ethicsandentrepreneurship.org; accessed April 11, 2016. ==Business career== Snider became a partner in Edge Ltd., a record company, and sold the company to join Jerry Wolman (builder) and his brother-in-law Earl Foreman (attorney) to buy the Philadelphia Eagles in 1964. He was given a 7% stake in the team, and served as vice president and treasurer.Profile, Jewishvirtuallibrary.org; accessed April 11, 2016. Upon learning that the NHL was planning to expand, Snider made plans for a new arena—the Spectrum—to house both a hockey team and the 76ers. On February 8, 1966, the NHL awarded Philadelphia a conditional franchise, one which would eventually be named the Philadelphia Flyers and start playing in 1967. Snider assumed control of the Spectrum in 1971, taking over as chairman of the board. In 1974 Snider created Spectacor as a holding company for the Flyers and the Spectrum. The Flyers became the first NHL expansion team to win the Stanley Cup in 1974, and to repeat as champions in 1975. Spectacor would found or acquire several businesses under his direction, most notably a regional premium cable channel, PRISM, and the first all-sports radio station, WIP. Seeing that a new arena would keep the Flyers competitive with the rest of the league, Snider began planning for what would become the CoreStates Center (now the Wells Fargo Center) in 1988. Prior to the Wells Fargo Center's opening in 1996, he sold a 66% stake in Spectacor to Philadelphia-based Comcast, creating Comcast Spectacor. However, Snider remained chairman of the venture, retaining a 34% interest. Soon after, Comcast Spectacor along with the Philadelphia Phillies created Comcast SportsNet in 1996. The company also bought the 76ers, who had been Snider's tenants since 1971. Comcast Spectacor also won an expansion franchise in the AHL, the Phantoms. In a 1999 Philadelphia Daily News poll, Snider was selected as the city's greatest sports mover and shaker, beating out legends such as Connie Mack, Sonny Hill, Bert Bell, and Roger Penske. In 2005, Snider became a prominent investor in a Foxwoods slots casino proposed for the waterfront in Philadelphia.Foxwoods website; accessed April 11, 2016. In September 2008, facing massive opposition at the originally intended site, backers for the slots casino decided to seek a new location in the Center City area, next to Philadelphia's Chinatown community. ==Nonprofit organizations== In 1985, Snider was one of the founding contributors of the Ayn Rand Institute (ARI), which was established by the philosopher Leonard Peikoff to promote Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. In 1990, after a dispute between ARI and philosopher David Kelley, Snider became a backer of Kelly's rival organization, the Institute for Objectivist Studies (now known as The Atlas Society). In 2003, Snider became a founding board member of the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness (now named Beyond Celiac.) He continued to support the organization until his death in 2016. In 2005, Snider created the Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation to provide a means to reach inner-city children in the Philadelphia area and provide them with the opportunity to learn to play hockey. ==Honors and awards== In 1988, Snider was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

It moves around the forest canopy in small family groups of two to four, part of larger groups of a few dozen animals. This monkey feeds on leaves, flowers, fruits, bark, honey and small insects, and it is an important means of seed dispersal for forest trees. Females give birth after a 230-day gestation period. The population of this monkey is decreasing as its forest habitat is lost to soybean production, deforestation and road construction. It is also regarded as a delicacy and hunted for food. For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the animal's conservation status as being \\"endangered\\". ==Distribution== The white-cheeked spider monkey is commonly found in the Brazilian Amazon. The area in which it is most likely to be found is between the Rio Tapajós (right bank) and its tributary, the Rio Teles Pires (right bank) and the Rio Xingu (left bank), south of the Rio Amazonas. A portion of their territory lies also within national forests such as Tapajós National Forest (), Xingu National Forest (), Altamira National Forest (), Itaituba I National Forest (), and Itaituba II National Forest (). ==Ecology== It is common for the white-cheeked spider monkey to travel in smaller groups of 2-4 when feeding and resting. At around 4–5 years of age, it apparently reaches sexual maturity and will give birth to one offspring after a gestation period of 226–232 days; the interbirth interval can last as long as 28–30 months in the wild. The diet of the white-cheeked spider monkey consists of fruit, leaves, flowers, aerial roots, bark, decaying wood, honey, and even some small insects such as termites and caterpillars. One very important impact it has on its habitat is to provide seed dispersal for different species of plants throughout their territory. It is thought that they provide movement for up to 138 different species of fruit seeds. ==Status== There are many different colors of spider monkeys, such as black, brown, and white. Their homes are in the upper levels of the rain forest. The white-cheeked spider monkey was placed on the endangered species list after an assessment in 2008 discovered that their population had decreased by 50% over the course of three generations; this decline can be attributed to habitat loss and hunting. This trend is expected to continue due to the increasing expansion of soybean agriculture. Also, parts of their habitat have been destroyed to make way for major highways and extensive deforestation. Some of the indigenous peoples in Brazil consider spider monkeys a delicacy, and when this is combined with their low reproduction rate, the population is sure to decline swiftly. It generally lives in groups of 20-30 individuals, but it is rare for them to be seen all together. ==References== white-cheeked spider monkey Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Primates of South America white-cheeked spider monkey ","title":"White-cheeked spider monkey"},{"id":"3242451","text":"The Peruvian spider monkey (Ateles chamek) also known as the black-faced black spider monkey, is a species of spider monkey that lives not only in Peru, but also in Brazil and Bolivia. At two feet (0.6 m) long, they are relatively large among species of monkey, and their strong, prehensile tails can be up to three feet (1 m) long. Unlike many species of monkey, they have only a vestigial thumb, an adaptation which enables them to travel using brachiation. Peruvian spider monkeys live in groups of 20-30 individuals, but these groups are rarely all together simultaneously. The size and dynamics of the resulting subgroups vary with food availability and sociobehavioral activity. They prefer to eat fleshy fruit, but will change their diet in response to scarcity of ripe fruit. Individuals of this species also eat small animals, insects and leaves based on availability. Females separate from the band to give birth, typically in the fall. These females inhabit a group of core areas where resources are abundant in certain seasons. Typically, males exhibit ranging over longer distances than females, with movement of individuals enhancing the fluidity of subgroup size. Peruvian spider monkey are independent at about 10 months, with a lifespan of about 20 years. ==Characteristics== The Peruvian spider monkey weighs up to 20 pounds (9 kg). Its body can be 24 inches (0.7m) long and the tail can be 36 inches (1m) long. It has four elongated fingers and virtually no thumb, which is typical for spider monkeys but unusual for other monkeys. It can move easily through the trees and it has a prehensile tail like other species in the genus Ateles, which it uses to assist with brachiation. It has an agility that can only be compared to the gibbon of Asia. It has a life span of up to 20 years.Spider Monkeys, Great Book of the Animal Kingdom, Crescent Books, Inc., pp. 378-379 ==Distribution == The species occurs in central-northern of Bolivia, north-eastern Peru, and the central-western Brazilian Amazon . The species was recently found to occur in the northern bank of Solimões River, at the Mamirauá Reserve, where it probably colonized through a river meander cutoff process. They live primarily in lowland forests, occupying the canopy and the sub-canopy, but they have been observed using various habitat types, including dry and hilly areas such as the piedmont and cerrado forests, and have been observed to move depending on food availability. They were also observed living in Amazonian seasonally flooded forests. They live in territorial bands of 6-12 individuals whose territory covers about 20 square kilometers. Band size is somewhat seasonal,Iwanaga, S., Ferrari S.F., 2001. Party Size and Diet of Syntopic Atelids (Ateles chamek and Lagothrix cana) in Southwestern Brazilian Amazonia. probably because females separate themselves from the band for a few months to give birth, primarily in the fall. It has to contest with other spider monkeys, woolly monkeys, and howler monkeys for food and territory. ==Food== The Peruvian spider monkey feeds on leaves, berries, small animals such as birds and frogs, flowers, termites, honey, grubs, and fruits. It is primarily frugivorous with a tendency to exhibit folivory in times of fruit scarcity. It will also eat insects, baby birds, bird eggs, and frogs. In the Amazon, groups of Peruvian spider monkeys show strong seasonal variations in habitat based on the availability of fleshy fruits. The foraging habits of this species causes the monkeys to be a vital component of seed dispersal patterns for many tree species in Amazonia. ==Growth and Reproduction== The spider monkey has a reproductive period that can span throughout the year, though most offspring are born at the start of the Autumn season. It has a gestation period of about 140 days. The pregnant female leaves the group to have her baby and returns 2–4 months later. The newborn spider monkey is independent at about 10 months. ==Conservation Status== This species of spider monkey, in addition to other species within the genus Ateles, is threatened due to exploitation by humans and habitat loss. It is currently listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as Endangered and is listed in Appendix II of CITES despite having been listed as a species of \\"Least concern\\" in 2003. The IUCN experts claim that the number of individuals has declined by at least 50% over the past 45 years. Researchers suggest that the species may effectively occupy only 28% of its entire range, and that only 32% of the species’ area of occupancy is legally protected . They also suggests that 31–40% of the species’ habitat will be lost by 2050. This decline is partially due to the fact that these monkeys are targeted by hunters for sale and consumption in the Amazonian bushmeat trade. Furthermore, habitat in the southern part of its range is being developed for agriculture and habitat in the southwestern Peruvian region of Madre de Dios is being polluted and destroyed by illegal mining activity. In Peru, illicit extraction of timber and wildlife products remain issues even in protected areas. Studies show that in heavily hunted and farmed areas, large-bodied primate species such as spider monkeys are likely to be some of the first species to be extirpated. Reintroduction efforts by researchers at Reserva Ecologica Taricaya have begun along the lower Madre de Dios river where conservation efforts now provide a suitable release site and protected habitat. ==Similar or related species== In addition to external appearance, the Peruvian spider monkey differs from the red-faced spider monkey by the number of chromosomes (2n = 32 in the red-faced vs. 2n = 34 in the Peruvian) in addition to several specific chromosomal differences. The two species have been interbred in captivity, resulting in offspring with reduced fertility (but not sterility).de Boer, L.E.M., de Bruijn, M., 2005. Chromosomal distinction between the red-faced and black-faced black spider monkey (Ateles paniscus paniscus and A. chamek.) There are several related species such as the Central American spider monkey or Geoffroy's spider monkey (A. geoffroyi), and the brown spider monkey (A. hybridus) and the species' closest relative the white-bellied spider monkey (A. belzebuth). All of these have a prehensile tail, a thumbless hand, and other characteristics that are found in all spider monkeys.Spider Monkey, Animal The Definitive Visual Guide to the World’s Wildlife, p. 123; Spider Monkeys, Great Book of the Animal Kingdom, Crescent Books, Inc., pp. 378-379 ==References== Category:Spider monkeys Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Mammals of Peru Category:Mammals of Bolivia Category:Mammals described in 1912 Category:Primates of South America ","title":"Peruvian spider monkey"},{"id":"3242465","text":"The brown spider monkey or variegated spider monkey (Ateles hybridus) is a critically endangered species of spider monkey, a type of New World monkey, from forests in northern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela.Emmons, L. H. (1997). Neotropical Rainforest Animals. 2nd edition. Pp. 144. Its taxonomic history has been confusing, and in the past it has been treated as a subspecies of either the Geoffroy's spider monkey or the white-fronted spider monkey. Like all spider monkeys, it has very long, spindly limbs and a lengthy prehensile tail which can almost be called a fifth limb. The brown spider monkey has a whitish belly and patch on the forehead, and – highly unusual among spider monkeys – the eyes are sometimes pale blue. ==Physical description== Ateles hybridus from Venezuela Brown spider monkeys have long and thin limbs with their forelimbs being longer than their hind limbs. They also have a distinctive long flexible, thin and prehensile tail which at times acts like a fifth limb. The tail has a highly flexible, hairless tip with skin grooves which improves grip. Their hands look slightly curvy and they have small thumbs. All these features make it possible for them to climb trees at high elevations, hang and swing from one tree to another without often having to lower themselves to the ground. Adult males weigh between and adult females weigh between . Their average adult body length is about . Their coloration ranges from light brown to dark on upper parts including the head. Their most distinctive characteristic is a whitish triangular forehead patch, although not all spider monkeys have one. Some few individuals have pale blue eyes.(Ankel-Simons, 1999; Fleagle, 1999; Morales Jiménez, 2007; Takahashi, 2008) == Range == Brown spider monkeys are found in northern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela. In Colombia, they are found from the right bank of the Magdalena River in the Magdalena and Cesar Departments, the south western portions of Guajira in the northernmost parts of the Serrania de Perija, and in the middle Magdalena River Valley at least to the Caldas and Cundinamarca Departments.Arauca (Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976; Defler 2003, 2004). In Venezuela, brown spider monkeys are normally found at altitudes between . Two subspecies are often recognized: A. h. hybridus (in both Colombia and Venezuela) and A. h. brunneus (between Cauca and Magdalena River in Colombia), but these are sometimes considered synonymous. == Habitat and ecology == Even though brown spider monkeys spend most of their time high in trees, they occasionally descend to eat soil and drink water. Since they like to forage in high canopies, they prefer undisturbed primary forests. This is because primary forests offer lifestyle they are comfortable in, for example endless canopies, tall trees, and many fruiting trees that disturbed forests do not offer.(Chapman and Onderdonk, 1998; Morales Jiménez, 2007; Takahashi, 2008; Urbani, et al., 2008) Brown spider monkeys always travel in small groups, and instead of walking or running on all fours, they travel mostly by swinging and climbing between trees. Brown spider monkeys mainly forage in the canopies of forests and rely mostly on their senses of sight, smell, taste, and touch to find food. Brown spider monkeys are mainly herbivores and frugivores. A main component of the brown spider monkey’s diet is ripe fruit. 83% of their diet is lipid rich fruits. However, in drier seasons where fruit is less abundant, brown spider monkeys feed on leaves, seeds, flowers, bark, honey, decaying wood, and occasionally insects such as termites and caterpillars. Brown spider monkeys feed on different species of figs year around. Scientists have observed spider monkeys eating soil and clay, and hypothesized that the reasons for this behavior could be to obtain minerals from the soil, for phosphorus, or in order to maintain a pH-balance in their digestive system. Brown spider monkeys find water to drink on the forest floor at “salado sites.” Competition for food occurs between spider monkeys and other frugivorous primates.(Chapman and Onderdonk, 1998; Cowlishaw and Dunbar, 2000; Link and Morales Jimenez, 2008; Takahashi, 2008; Urbani, et al., 2008) Average lifespan of a spider monkey is 27 years, however, in captivity that can be increased by 10 or more years.(Takahashi, 2008) Natural enemies include jaguars (Panthera onca), mountain lions (Puma concolor), harpy eagles (Harpia harpyja), and crested eagles (Morphnus guianensis). Brown spider monkeys are known to shake branches in order to ward off potential predators.(Chapman and Onderdonk, 1998; Cowlishaw and Dunbar, 2000; Link and Morales Jimenez, 2008; Takahashi, 2008; Urbani, et al., 2008 == Status == Video clip The brown spider monkey is among \\"The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates\\", and is one of only two Neotropical primates (the other being the yellow-tailed woolly monkey) to have been included in this list in both 2006–2008 and 2008–2010. The population is estimated to have decreased by at least 80% and some populations have already been extirpated. Few remaining populations are of adequate size to be viable long-term. Almost 60 brown spider monkeys were recorded at various zoo (mostly European) that participated in the International Species Information System in 2010, but breeding is slow.International Species Information System (2010). Ateles hybridus. Retrieved 21 May 2010. Habitat loss is ongoing within its wild range, and an estimated 98% of its habitat already is gone.Fundación ProAves (2010). Tragic demise of the Magdalena Spider Monkey. Retrieved 21 May 2010. Habitat loss is driven both by logging, and land clearance for agriculture and cattle ranches. It is also threatened by hunting (in some regions it is the favorite game) and the wild animals trade. One study did not show a significant difference between population densities inside versus outside forest areas disturbed by loggers. It has been hypothesized that this anomaly is due to the sample being taken from El Paujil reserve, which is a protected area and may serve as refuge from other human activities, namely poaching.BioOne Online Journal (2008). Retrieved 22 October 2013. A small population of fewer than 30 individuals of the subspecies A. h. brunneus has been discovered in a protected area of Colombia, the Selva de Florencia National Park.

The book, which portrayed the world of New York's Italian- American construction workers during The Great Depression,Rosero, Jessica. \\"Native sons and daughters: Tragedy Led Italian Novelist in UC to Pen Literary Classic; Christ in Concrete.\\" Hudson Reporter February 12, 2006. was hailed by critics in the United States and abroad as a metaphor for the immigrant experience in America,Severo, Richard. \\"Pietro di Donato Is Dead at 80; Wrote of Immigrants' Experience\\", The New York Times, January 21, 1992. Accessed December 10, 2007. \\"Mr. di Donato was born on April 3, 1911, in West Hoboken, N.J. His family had immigrated to the United States from Vasto, in the Abruzzi region of Italy.\\" and cast di Donato as one of the most celebrated Italian American novelists of the mid-20th century. ==Early life== Di Donato was born April 3, 1911 in West Hoboken, New Jersey (now Union City) to Geremio, a bricklayer, and Annunziata Chinquina. He had seven other siblings. His parents had emigrated from the town of Vasto, in the region of Abruzzo in Italy.Pietro di Donato: Acclaimed American Author; Union City Historical Marker Dedication Ceremony Program; May 22, 2010 On March 30, 1923, Geremio di Donato died when a building collapsed on him, burying him in concrete. Pietro, who was twelve at the time, left school in the seventh grade to become a construction worker in the trade union in order to help support his family. He retained his membership in the union his entire life. His father's death and his life growing up as an immigrant in West Hoboken were the inspiration for his writings. When his mother died a few years later, Pietro assumed full responsibility for providing for his family. Though he had little formal education, during a strike in the building trades he had wandered into a library and discovered French and Russian novels, becoming particularly fond of Émile Zola. He also took night classes at City College in construction and engineering. The family was eventually able to move to Northport, Long Island, where he continued to work as a mason, and was inspired by Zola's work to write about his own experiences in the Italian immigrant community. ==Career== Christ in Concrete was published as a short story in the March 1937 issue of Esquire magazine, and was subsequently expanded into a full-length, blue- collar proletarian novel with an introduction by Arnold Gingrich. The book remained on best-seller lists for months, and was eventually chosen for the Book of the Month Club main selection, edging out John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, which was published the same year. According to Allen Barra in an interview for Salon.com, the novel became an instant classic, and standard reading for second-generation Italian-Americans. Screenwriter Ben Barzman, who wrote the screenplay into which the novel was adapted, called it \\"the first of its kind\\", and The National Italian American Foundation called it \\"rare.\\" Charles Poore, writing in The New York Times on Sept. 15, 1939, described the book as \\"eloquent\\" and \\"Italian to the core...by turns operatic, lyrical, ferocious and hilarious\\", and commented, \\"It was something rare, a proletarian novel written by a proletarian.\\" It was included in Edward O'Brien's Best Short Stories of 1938. The novel was adapted into the 1949 film Give Us This Day (U.S. title: \\"Christ in Concrete\\"), written by Ben Barzman, and directed by blacklisted filmmaker Edward Dmytryk. It won awards at festivals across Europe, such as the 1949 Venice Film Festival, though it was effectively banned from the United States at the time, and was only shown in a single theatre. In 1958 di Donato wrote his second novel, a sequel to Christ in Concrete called This Woman. It continued the story of di Donato's life following his father's death, and focused on his spiritual conflict and obsessive sensuality. In 1960 a third book in the same tradition called Three Circles of Light, focused on di Donato's childhood in the years prior to his father's death. That same year, di Donato published The Immigrant Saint: The Life of Mother Cabrini, a fictionalized account of Frances Xavier Cabrini, the first United States citizen to be canonized. It was well-received, and named a main selection of the Catholic Book Club and Maryknoll Book Club in 1961. Though critics felt that di Donato's later works never achieved the quality of Christ in Concrete, Immigrant Saint became a cult classic. The following year di Donato published The Penitent, an account of contrition and spiritual rebirth of the man who killed the twelve-year-old St. Maria Goretti. His last book-length publication was Naked as an Author, a collection of reprinted stories from his longer works. In 1978 his article on the kidnapping and murder of Aldo Moro (president of the Christian Democratic Party of Italy), titled \\"Christ in Plastic\\", appeared in Penthouse magazine, and won the Overseas Press Club. Di Donato later adapted the article into a play entitled Moro. ==Personal life== Following the death of his father, Di Donato became the breadwinner for his mother and seven siblings. He joined the Young Communist League in response to the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti.Carol Strickland, \\"An Immigrant's Pain in Concrete,\\" New York Times, October 14, 1990, https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/14/nyregion/an-immigrant-s-pain-in- concrete.html?pagewanted=all In 1942, after registering as a conscientious objector to World War II, Di Donato, while working as a forester in a Cooperstown, New York Quaker camp, met former showgirl Helen Dean. They were married in 1943, in a ceremony performed by New York City's Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, and moved to Setauket, Long Island. They had two sons, Peter and Richard, and a stepdaughter, Harriet Mull. ==Death and legacy== Dedication of Pietro di Donato Square in Union City, New Jersey, May 22, 2010. Holding a copy of Christ in Concrete in front of the plaque is di Donato's son, Richard. At right is Union City Mayor Brian P. Stack. Di Donato died of bone cancer January 19, 1992 in Stony Brook, Long Island, with his last unfinished novel, Gospels, unpublished. He is the subject of the book Pietro DiDonato, the Master Builder by Matthew Diomede, published by Bucknell University Press in 1995.

The books are meant for younger readers. The books ranged from 100 pages to 200 pages in large print. The series of 12 books was written by John Whitman, and were released from February 1997 through to October 1998. ==Summary== The books are about a young brother and sister, Zak and Tash, who travel the galaxy with their mysterious Uncle Hoole. Tash and Zak are orphans; their parents were on their homeworld of Alderaan when it was destroyed by the Death Star. Tash is fascinated with the Jedi, while Zak is interested in machines and technology. The first six books form an arc. The protagonists discover pieces of a large Imperial experiment in biological weapons, codenamed Project Starscream. The first five books deal with the heroes discovering the various components of Project Starscream, each dangerous in its own right. The sixth book deals with their discovery of the final goal of the experiments: creating a prototype organism, simply named \\"Weapon\\". The next six books lacked a central arc. The protagonists, now wanted fugitives, simply travel from planet to planet attempting to avoid Imperial authorities. Each book told a story of the main characters stumbling onto some danger and the resulting adventure. === Eaten Alive=== Tash and Zak Arranda are preteen siblings whose parents were killed when the Galactic Empire destroyed their home planet of Alderaan. With nowhere else to go, they began to travel with their Uncle Hoole, a mysterious shape- shifting Shi'ido who studies different species on many planets. With him they live on his starship, the Lightrunner, and learn from their new caretaker droid, DV-9. When they travel to the mysterious planet of D'vouran, they are pulled out of hyperspace, seemingly too soon, by the planet's gravity and crash land at the spaceport. Though Tash feels bad things about the planet, the Enzeen, the alien race who live on the planet, are more than happy to help out with anything they need while on the planet. D'vouran has become a tourist destination and the Enzeen hope to bring more people to live on the planet. When Chood, the Enzeen who personally helps the family, brings them to an inn to find help in repairing the engine, they are attacked and the children taken captive by the forces of Shada the Hutt, who demands Hoole's service. With help from the Rebels who are also investigating the planet, Shada's forces release the children. Outside of the inn they meet Kevreb Bebo, a disgraced pilot who tries to warn the people staying on planet that people are disappearing. When their Uncle Hoole leaves them with Chood while he is studying, Tash sees an alien creature standing over a sleeping Zak. Waking him, they run to town to warn the others, only to find that no one is chasing them. After Hoole speaks to them, Tash stops worrying about the planet and who is chasing them. The next day, Zak, while alone, is attacked by Shada's forces. Bebo is there also, and manages to evade all their laser shots at him. Hoole is eventually able to stop Shada, but Tash convinces him to let her speak with Bebo. He brings her, accompanied by DV-9, to a cave where he shows her a laboratory which had long ago been abandoned. He shows her a seemingly bottomless pit, which she feels there is something wrong with, and he shows her his medallion, a device which apparently keeps him safe from the disappearances. Believing him, she tries to return to the town. He gives her his medallion, but after she has gone, he is killed by one of Shada's guards. As she returns to town, she is attacked by the Enzeen, who have become parasitic monsters, but manages to escape, when an earthquake shakes the ground. Back at town, however, everyone is missing, and she goes to Shada's fortress, thinking he has done something. There she finds Zak in captivity. With DV-9's help they escape Shada's fortress, but are recaptured easily. However, now outside the fortress, Shada, his guards, and the children are attacked by the Enzeen and the planet, as holes begin to open up and take people into the planet. Shada, on his repulsor sled and the children, protected by the medallion, are kept safe, but are brought by the Enzeen to the heart of the planet, the pit Bebo showed Tash. There it is revealed that the planet is alive and needs nourishment and the Enzeen get their own nourishment from the planet while attracting more people to come. The medallion created a forcefield around the wearers that the planet couldn't absorb. When Hoole, who was disguised as an Enzeen, gets the medallion, he throws it into the pit, causing planet to begin to erupt. Able to escape the pit, even as Shada falls in and is absorbed, they finally reach their ship. The ship, however, is unable to take-off as the planet has grabbed hold of it. Losing hope, the Millennium Falcon comes to their rescue and with deft flying by Han Solo, is finally able to escape the planet, which collapses on itself behind them. ===City of the Dead=== The Millennium Falcon drops off Tash, Zak and Hoole at the beginning, indicating that City of the Dead takes place mere days after Eaten Alive. The family proceeds to buy a new ship afterwards. During the book, Zak is buried alive in a tomb. The characters, Boba Fett and Doctor Evazan are featured. ===Planet Plague=== ===The Nightmare Machine=== Zak and Tash visit a family friendly theme park called 'Hologram Fun World' to relax while Hoole continues his work. They discover that the attraction, the 'Nightmare Machine', which manifests seemingly harmless versions of your worst fears, is far more than it seems. For one, the voice code to end the simulation is broken. Lando Calrissian appears, interested in purchasing the theme park. Hologram Fun World has been mentioned in a New Jedi Order novel. ===Ghost of the Jedi=== Tash, Zak, and their uncle Hoole are fleeing from the threat of the Imperial scientist Borborygmus Gog. There seems to be safe refuge on Nespis 8, an abandoned space station. This place also once housed a Jedi library. According to the group's ally, Deevee, the library is still there, along with the ghost of a Jedi. The station also holds the hope to stopping Gog and a threat far worse than a disturbed Jedi spirit. ===Army of Terror=== This book is the final chapter of the \\"Project Starscream\\" story arc. Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Luke Skywalker, and C-3PO all make an appearance in the book as they attempt to stop Project Starscream. Their appearance in the book is apparently prior to their relocation to Hoth. The shadow creatures inhabiting Kiva were reduced to that state by an accident caused by Gog and Hoole. Little is said about the connection between Gog and Hoole, but they once worked together, which is interesting because they are both Shi'idos. Gog's weapon is disguised as an innocent baby, with a bruise on his forehead, named \\"Eppon\\". Many people left alone with the baby mysteriously disappear. The baby also grows at an alarming rate and quickly matures into an adult. When the Rebels find an imperial lab, they also find Gog, who reveals that Hoole's full name is Mammon Hoole, who the Shadows had been talking about. Then, it is revealed that Eppon is really an imperial Bio-weapon. Eppon turns into a giant monster which tries to eat Hoole. Tash convinces Eppon to turn on Gog, who promptly blows Eppon up with a control he had in his coat, much to Tash's dismay. The Shadows burst in to kill Hoole, when suddenly the computer in the lab is turned on, revealing that it was Gog who rigged an experiment to make the power of a star in a test tube fail, and as a result it was Gog who created the Shadows. Gog is promptly killed by the Shadows immediately afterward. ===The Brain Spiders=== Many canonical characters and elements appear in The Brain Spiders such as Jabba the Hutt and Bib Fortuna. The brain spider the title references can be seen in Return of the Jedi. A murderer who carves a K into his victims is imprisoned in Jabba's palace, when the story begins. A prisoner tricks Zak into believing that he is innocent, and Zak lets him escape. This is presumed to be the same murderer. Later, Zak thinks he sees Tash kill someone and carve the same K. This is explained when a brain spider spells out \\"IM TASH\\" in sand, suggesting that the murderer's brain was placed in Tash's body and that Tash's brain was placed in a spider. Tash tries to develop her sense of the force at the Sarlacc pit. ===The Swarm=== Grand Admiral Thrawn appears in the story. Zak, Tash and Hoole wisely decide not to board his Star Destroyer when given the chance. Zak was not responsible for the swarm, as a pile of dead shreevs was discovered at the end of the story. ===Spore=== Spore was imprisoned on an asteroid. When the vault on the asteroid is broken, Zak notices that it was designed as a prison because of the way the doors opened. Spore later infects a number of characters, temporarily. Jerec appears and claims to be an imperial officer. ===The Doomsday Ship=== All unfortunate events that took place on the Star of Empire, were orchestrated by a supercomputer (SIM?) designed as a harmless autopilot for the ship. The computer seemingly had its own agenda, when it forced the evacuation of most passengers by falsely warning them of a critical meltdown. The rebel Dash Rendar, meets the protagonists of the story, but Zak and Tash do not trust him as much as other rebels. The computer communicates with Zak and Tash frequently. A large part of the book is written in a font specifically devoted to the computer's speech. Zak and Tash trusted the computer for most of the story and only discovered its sinister motives at the end. Doomsday Ship is notable for having an intentionally unresolved ending. When Tash and Zak, think they have deactivated the computer, it turns itself back on and rectifies its own errors. ===Clones=== Cloning is first indicated when Tash sees the same person walk by twice. The book is especially notable for the fight between Darth Vader and his clearly insane clone. The book also alerts readers to the goings on in wild space, on two separate but varied worlds called Weik and Odessen. ===The Hunger=== The Hunger is the final Galaxy of Fear book and the first to feature Deevee since Army of Terror. Hoole, Tash and Zak are still looking for a place where the Empire won't find them. After losing their ship in an attack by a bounty hunter, they find themselves landing on a certain swamp planet, where they encounter a rather friendly but starving tribe of survivors. Boba Fett is after the group, and in various occasions has them in his grasp. Yoda also makes an appearance in this book, teaching the children a valuable lesson. ==See also== * Goosebumps ==External links== * Star Wars Cargo Bay Page *Official CargoBay Listing *Official CargoBay Listing *Official CargoBay Listing *Official CargoBay Listing *Official CargoBay Listing Category:American horror novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Book series introduced in 1997 Category:Horror novel series Category:Juvenile series Category:Science fiction book series Category:Science fiction horror novels Category:Series of books Category:Star Wars Legends novels ","title":"Galaxy of Fear"},{"id":"3242497","text":" The Grumman AF Guardian was the first purpose-built anti-submarine warfare (ASW) carrier-based aircraft to enter service with the United States Navy.Kowalski 1991, p. 3. It consisted of two airframe variants, one for detection gear, the other for weapons. The Guardian remained in service until August 1955, when it was replaced by the twin-engined Grumman S-2 Tracker. The Guardian was the largest single-engine piston-powered carrier aircraft ever to see service. ==Design and development== An AF-2W from VS-37 in flight circa July 1957 The original design concept for the aircraft that would become the Guardian, the XTB2F of 1944, was for a twin-engined aircraft with a warload and a range of 3,700 mi (5,950 km).Kowalski 1991, pp. 2–3. This was considered to be too large for practical use from an , and was cancelled in 1945, replaced by a modified Grumman F7F Tigercat, the XTSF-1. However, this too was considered impractical,Norton 2008, p. 120. and another alternative, the internally developed Grumman Model G-70, was selected instead, being given the Navy designation XTB3F-1. This was designed as mixed-power aircraft, with a Pratt & Whitney Double Wasp radial engine in the nose and a Westinghouse 19XB turbojet in the tail. Originally, the Westinghouse engine was to be the new X24C which was to emerge as the J34 series. When it became apparent the X24C delivery schedules would not meet the airframe schedule, the 19XB-2B was substituted. This was found to be unsuitable, and the jet engine was removed without ever having been used in flight. The XTB3F-1S carried a crew of two seated side-by-side and an armament of two 20 mm cannon and 4,000 lb (1,814 kg) of bombs, torpedoes and/or rockets, and made its first flight on 19 December 1945. On 24 December 1945, the Navy changed the role of the aircraft from torpedo-bomber to anti-submarine warfare. All the required equipment could not be fitted into a single aircraft, consequently two variants would be produced, one as a \\"guppy\\" (hunter) and another as a \\"scrapper\\" (killer).Kowalski 1991, p. 16. The hunter aircraft would not carry any armament,Donald and March 2001, p. 46. but instead two additional crew members and a ventral radome for AN/APS-20 search radar and electronic countermeasures (ECM) consisting of an AN/APR-98 countermeasures receiver and AN/AP-70 bearing indicator.Kowalski 1991, p. 18. This aircraft, the XTB3F-1S, first flew in November 1948. The \\"killer\\" deleted the cannon of the torpedo bomber, but retained the bomb bay, added a third crewmember, a searchlight, and short- range radar, and (as the XTB3F-2S) first flew in January 1949. ==Operational history== An AF-2S in the colors of VS-25 pictured while owned by Aero Union Corporation, circa 1978/79. Redesignated as AF-2W (TB3F-1S) and AF-2S (TB3F-2S), the Guardian entered fleet service on 27 September 1950 with three aircraft delivered to VS-24,Kowalski 1991, p. 14. with full service introduction shortly after with VS-25.Wagner 1982, p. 498. A total of 193 AF-2S Guardians were built. In 1952, the AF-3S (hunter) was introduced, fitting a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) for the detection of submerged submarines; 40 of this variant were built. The last Guardian was delivered to the Navy in March 1953, with a total of 389 built.Goebel, Greg. \\"Grumman AF Guardian.\\" VectorSite, 2009. Retrieved: 16 January 2011. The Guardian saw service in the maritime patrol role during the Korean War, however it proved unpopular with pilots, being underpowered and heavy on the controls; the aircraft suffered from a severely high accident rate. Shortly after the end of the war, it began to be replaced by the Grumman S2F Tracker, the U.S. Navy first purpose-built ASW airplane to combine the hunter and killer roles in a single airframe.Donald and March 2001, p. 50. The last AF retired from active service on 31 August 1955, but it remained in service with the US Naval Air Reserve until 1957. ==Variants== The underside of an AF-2S showing its opened weapons bay ; XTB3F-1 :Prototypes of two-seat torpedo bomber powered by one 2,300 hp R-2800-46 engine and a Westinghouse turbojet; three built. ; XTB3F-1S & -2S :Two modified XTB3F-1 prototypes with turbojet removed and ventral radome, later redesignated as XAF-1. ; AF-2S :Production variant with 2,400 hp R-2800-48 engine, 193 built.Swanborough and Bowers 1990, p. 246. ; AF-2W :Hunter variant with search radar in a ventral radome, 153 built. ; AF-3S :Hunter/Killer variant similar to AF-2S with retractable MAD boom, 40 built. ; Grumman Model G-90 : Proposed combined AF-2S/-2W version, cancelled. ==Operators== Grumman AF Guardian in Aero Union colors at Pima ; * United States Navy * Aero Union ==Surviving aircraft== AF-2 Guardian on display at the National Museum of Naval Aviation Grumman AF Guardian at Pima Air Museum After disposal by the U.S. Navy five Guardians saw many years service with Aero Union based at Chico, California, in the forest firefighting role, the last being retired in 1978. ;Airworthy ;;AF-2S *126792 - privately owned in Ocala, Florida.\\"FAA Registry: N9995Z\\" FAA.gov Retrieved: 24 July 2014. ;On display ;;AF-2S *123100 - National Naval Aviation Museum at NAS Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida.

The lifespan for Azara's night monkey is unknown, but the captive life span for members of the genus Aotus is believed to be 20 years. == Behavior and ecology == Azara's night monkey is a monogamous species, with the male remaining present to raise the offspring and provide food. The offspring will only stay with its family until two to three years of age and then will disperse to begin a family of its own. There is very little sexual dimorphism in this species. Azara's night monkey is primarily a frugivore, but also will eat things such as leaves, flowers, and insects. One of the main advantages of being a nocturnal animal is that there is greatly reduced competition from diurnal animals. Azara's night monkey spends its life in trees and becomes more active when the moon is brighter, tending to keep to its well-known paths. However, uniquely among night monkeys, populations of Azara's night monkey from the Gran Chaco are active both day and night. Azara's night monkey can be found sleeping in groups of between 2 and 5 others in trees. The average group size is about 3 monkeys, consisting of an adult pair and their offspring. It leaps from tree to tree but also moves quadrupedally throughout the forest. == Habitat and distribution == Azara's night monkey is found in northern Argentina, Bolivia, central Brazil, Paraguay and far southeastern Peru. Its range includes the southern Amazon, ranging into more open habitats such as the Gran Chaco. Aotus a. azarae is found in gallery forest and semi- deciduous forest, A. a. infulatus is found in humid lowland forest and gallery forest, and A. a. infulatus is found in various forest types. The last has been recorded as high as in the Andean foothills. == Conservation == Azara's night monkey is widespread and believed to be overall fairly common. It is present in several reserves. The species is not considered threatened, but is declining locally due to habitat loss. == References == == External links == *Aotus azarae information at ThePrimata. *Aotus: The Owl Monkey's Natural History at MD Anderson.

Although a great warrior in his youth, and having taken part in the Grattan massacre, he declined to participate in Red Cloud's War. He had become convinced of the futility of opposing the white incursions into his homeland; he became a statesman, speaking for peace and defending the rights of his tribe. He made several trips to Washington, D.C. in the 1870s to represent his people, and was noted for his interest in bringing education to the Sioux. He was shot and killed by Crow Dog, a Brulé Lakota subchief, in 1881 for reasons which have been disputed. ==Early years== Spotted Tail was born about 1823 in the White River country west of the Missouri River in present-day South Dakota. His father, Cunka or Tangle Hair, was from the Saône band, and his mother, Walks-with-the- Pipe, was a Brulé. He was given the birth name of Jumping Buffalo. During the previous 40 years, the Lakota or Teton Sioux had moved from present-day Minnesota and eastern South Dakota to areas west of the Missouri. They had differentiated into several sub-tribes or bands, including the Saône, Brulé and Oglala. During this time the people adopted the use of horses and expanded their range in hunting the buffalo across their wide grazing patterns. The young man took his warrior name, Spotted Tail, after receiving a gift of a raccoon tail from a white trapper; he sometimes wore a raccoon tail in his war bonnet. He took part in the Grattan Massacre. Two of his sisters, Iron Between Horns and Kills Enemy, were married to the elder Crazy Horse, in what was traditional Sioux practice for elite men. Spotted Tail may have been the maternal uncle of the famous warrior Crazy Horse, which meant he was a relative of the notable Touch the Clouds as well. General Anson Mills, who knew Spotted Tail well, called him \\"a fine-looking man, with engaging manners, perfectly loyal to the government, a lover of peace, knowing no good could come to his people from war,\\" a man who had both a high respect for and confidence in U.S. Army officers as well as a good sense of humor.Anson Mills, My Story (Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 2003 [1918]), 158, 164, 167. ==Marriage and family== Wife of Spotted Tail Spotted Tail married and had children. Eugene Fitch Ware, a Fort Laramie army officer, wrote that Spotted Tail's daughter, Ah-ho-appa (Fallen Leaf), \\"... was one of those individuals found in all lands, at all places, and among all people; she was misplaced.\\" He suggested that she adopted some European-American practices, and that she was thought to be secretly in love with one of the officers at the fort. When she was dying in 1866, Fallen Leaf made her father promise that she would be buried on a hillside overlooking Fort Laramie. The entire garrison at the post helped Spotted Tail to honor her request by arranging for a ceremonial funeral, including a Christian service and Sioux ceremony. Many years later, Spotted Tail had her remains transported to the Rosebud Indian Agency in South Dakota and re-interred. ==The Treaty of Fort Laramie== Spotted Tail agreed to the treaty, which in 1868 established the Great Sioux Reservation in West River, west of the Missouri River. In 1871, the senior Spotted Tail visited Washington, D.C. to meet the Commissioner of Indian Affairs Ely S. Parker and President Ulysses S. Grant. While there, he met with Red Cloud, a chief of the Oglala Lakota, and they agreed to work together on preserving Sioux rights and land. In 1881, following the Black Hills War, Spotted Tail was killed by Crow Dog for reasons that have been disputed. Luther Standing Bear claimed Spotted Tail was killed by Crow Dog for having sold land not belonging to him and for taking the wife of a crippled man. Although these actions are said to have angered many Sioux leaders, Spotted Tail refused to give the woman back, claiming the United States government stood behind him. Several men decided to kill Spotted Tail but, before they could act, he was killed by Crow Dog on August 5, 1881.Luther Standing Bear, Land of the Spotted Eagle (1928) (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2006), 157-59. Nevertheless, according Richard N. Ellis in the introduction to the 2006 imprint, there is \\"no evidence\\" to support the charge that Spotted Tail had stolen Sioux land or taken a crippled man's wife. (xxiv) According to historian Dee Brown: \\"White officials...dismissed the killing as the culmination of a quarrel over a woman, but Spotted Tail's friends said that it was the result of a plot to break the power of the chiefs.\\"* ==Prelude to the Great Sioux War of 1876-77== Spotted Tail's delegation to Washington In 1874, George Armstrong Custer led a reconnaissance mission into Sioux territory that reported gold in the Black Hills, an area held sacred by the local Indians. Formerly, the Army tried to keep miners out but did not succeed; the threat of violence grew. In May 1875, delegations headed by Spotted Tail, Red Cloud, and Lone Horn traveled to Washington, D.C. in a last- ditch attempt to persuade President Grant to honor existing treaties and stem the flow of miners into their territories. The Indians met with Grant, Secretary of the Interior Delano, and Commissioner of Indian Affairs Smith, who informed them that Congress wanted to resolve the matter by giving the tribes $25,000 for their land and resettling them into Indian Territory. The Indians rejected such a treaty, with Spotted Tail's reply to the proposition being as follows: > My father, I have considered all the Great Father told me, and have come > here to give you an answer.... When I was here before, the President gave me > my country, and I put my stake down in a good place, and there I want to > stay.... I respect the Treaty (doubtless referring to the 1868 Treaty of > Fort Laramie) but the white men who come in our country do not. You speak of > another country, but it is not my country; it does not concern me, and I > want nothing to do with it. I was not born there.... If it is such a good > country, you ought to send the white men now in our country there and let us > alone.... Spotted Tail, by Henry Farny ==Death in 1881== On August 5, 1881, after a long simmering feud, Crow Dog shot and killed Chief Spotted Tail on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. Crow Dog was arrested and tried in a territorial court in Deadwood, Dakota Territory, and found guilty of murder and sentenced to hang. In the case of Ex parte Crow Dog, the United States Supreme Court overturned the verdict because the Deadwood Court had no jurisdiction in a case of one Indian killing another on reservation lands. Crow Dog was released and returned to the Rosebud. Spotted Tail's grave on the Rosebud Reservation Spotted Tail is buried in Rosebud, South Dakota. A tribal university (Sinte Gleska University) on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota was named for him in 1971.History of Sinte Gleska Sinte Gleska University ==Impact on Indian Legal Jurisprudence and Tribal Sovereignty== Spotted Tail's death influenced critical Indian law principles, long after his death. The case of Ex parte Crow Dog established that Indian tribes retain their sovereignty. The case also motivated the immediate creation, starting in 1885 of a series of federal statutes laying out the division of power between federal courts and Indian tribal courts to try Indian and non-Indian persons, in different circumstances for different crimes on Indian reservations. However Ex parte Crow Dog also established the plenary powers doctrine, giving Congress the power to pass any law they choose (including laws altering treaties that had been previously entered into), even over the opposition of the tribe or tribes affected. ==See also== * Paha Sapa (The Black Hills photography.) * Ex parte Crow Dog ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * * ==External links== * Category:1820s births Category:1881 deaths Category:Murdered Native American people Category:People of the Great Sioux War of 1876 Category:Lakota leaders Category:Native American leaders Category:American frontier Category:People murdered in South Dakota Category:Date of birth unknown Category:Place of death missing Category:People from Rosebud Indian Reservation, South Dakota Category:1881 murders in the United States Category:Deaths by firearm in South Dakota ","title":"Spotted Tail"},{"id":"3242524","text":"Nancy Ma's night monkey (Aotus nancymaae) is a night monkey species from South America.

He was a member of the Kiowa tribe, born around 1820, during the height of the power of the Plains Tribes, probably along the Canadian River in the traditional winter camp grounds of his people. One of the best known, and last, of the Kiowa War Chiefs, he developed a reputation as an outstanding warrior and in his twenties was made a sub-chief of his tribe, under Dohäsan, as Chief. He fought with him at the First Battle of Adobe Walls, and earned enduring fame for his use of an army bugle to confuse the troops in battle. Satanta was born the son of Chief Red Tipi and a Spanish captive and spent his youth south of the Arkansas River enjoying the peaceful alliance between the Kiowa and Comanche tribes.\\"The Long Journey Home Dedication Ceremonies for the Return of Set'tainte's Shield and Weapons\\" ==Orator and warrior== One of best known leaders of his tribe in the 1860s–1870s, Satanta was well known for both his prowess as a warrior, and his soaring oratorical powers. Dohäsan was the principal Chief until his death. Satanta was one of the Chiefs who negotiated several treaties with the American government during the 1860s, including the Little Arkansas Treaty (1865) and the Medicine Lodge Treaty (1867). In the latter, Satanta agreed that the Kiowas would live on a reservation. When the tribe failed to move onto it, Satanta was seized by General George Custer and held as a hostage until the forced removal and migration took place. ==At the First Battle of Adobe Walls== Satanta is primarily remembered in military history as the sub- chief to Dohäsan at the First Battle of Adobe Walls. While Dohäsan, helped by Satank and Guipago, was in command of the combined Kiowa, Kiowa-Apache, and Comanche forces which opposed Kit Carson and his New Mexico forces in November 1864, Satanta is remembered for ably assisting him in repeated charges which drove the New Mexico volunteers from the field, and for his repeated blowing of an army bugle, which confused the troops under Carson. Satanta would counter Carson's bugler with trumpeted commands of his own, on a day where the Plains Tribes managed to drive a US Army detachment from the field. The Indian forces assembled from their nearby winter encampments vastly outnumbered the Army detachment, which retreated in good order. ==Medicine Lodge Treaty== At Medicine Lodge, Satanta, a tall, muscular man, came to be known as the \\"Orator of the Plains\\" (although that title may have been a humorous reference to his long-winded speeches rather than honest praise for his speaking abilities; this is disputed however by the references papers of the day made to his speeches). Like most treaties of the time, these agreements failed utterly to bring peace on the frontier. The treaty assured rule over the vast lands given by treaty to the Kiowa, but white settlers continued to pour across Kiowa lands, and tribesmen, unhappy with the provision that reduced their domain to a small reservation, continued to raid settlements and harass immigrants. This situation, unstable in and of itself, worsened significantly with the death of Dohäsan, the last Kiowa Chief (over the entire Kiowa People) in 1866. Without his binding personal leadership, Kiowa unity dissolved as a number of subchiefs, Tene-angopte, and, on the other side, Satanta and Guipago (Gui-pah- gho, Lone Wolf), struggled for power and to fill his place. The competition between the three set off a wave of raids across the southern plains from Kansas to Texas during the fall of 1866 and into 1867. In one instance Satanta and a joint Kiowa-Comanche war party raided into the Texas panhandle and, after killing James Box, captured the man's wife and four children, whom they sold to the army at Fort Dodge, Kansas. It is alleged that at Fort Dodge that Satanta, begging for liquor, accidentally drank animal medicine and was given pills that only made him even more sick. In revenge Satanta burned hay belonging to Mr. Coryell opposite the fort and killed three woodchoppers as well.The Globe-Republican, January 7, 1897, Image 1 ==Fort Zarah== Satanta's fame grew after the Box incident, and his ability to defuse a confrontation between the Kiowa and the US Cavalry near Fort Zarah, Kansas in 1867. A young Kiowa warrior was killed at the civilian camp near the army Fort, and the Kiowa massed to avenge his death. The cavalry, in turn, massed to protect the civilians. Satanta managed to defuse the confrontation, but nonetheless, later in the day, the Cavalry attacked the Kiowa encampment. Satanta then led the defense of the camp by the warriors while the women and children retreated. ==Warren Wagon Train Raid== In 1871 Satanta led several attacks on wagon trains in Texas. His undoing came with the Warren Wagon Train Raid on May 18, 1871. Immediately prior to that attack, the Indians had allowed an Army Ambulance with a small guard to pass unharmed; in it was General William Tecumseh Sherman, but Mamanti, the medicine man, had advised the other chiefs to wait for a richer loot. The wagon train had attempted to fight the war party by shifting into a ring formation, and all the mules were put into the center of the ring. Despite this, the warriors captured all of the supplies in the train, killing and mutilating seven of the wagoneer's bodies. Five men however, managed to escape. As soon as Col. Ranald S. Mackenzie learned of the incident, he informed Sherman. Sherman and Mackenzie searched for the warriors responsible for the raid. Satanta foolishly bragged of his, Satank (Sitting Bear), and Ado-ete (Big Tree)'s involvement of the raid, and, in spite of Guipago's intervention (the head chief came in well equipped with loaded rifles and revolvers, fit to fight for his friend's liberty, but had to surrender in front of the massive presence of military troops) Sherman personally arrested him. ==Trial of Satanta and Big Tree - First Indian Leaders Tried In State Court== General Sherman ordered the trial of Satanta and Big Tree, along with Satank making them the first Native American Leaders to be tried for raids in a US Court. Sherman ordered the three Kiowa sub- chiefs taken to Jacksboro, Texas, to stand trial for murder. Satank had no intention of allowing himself to be humiliated by being tried by the white man's court, and told the Tonkawa scouts before the three were to be transported to Fort Richardson that they should tell his family they would be able to find his body along the trail. Satank refused to get in the wagon, and after the soldiers threw him in, he hid his head under his red blanket (worn as a sign of his membership in the Koitsenko). The soldiers apparently believed the old Chief was hiding his face because of humiliation, but in reality, he was gnawing his wrists to the bone so that he could get out of the chains they had put on him. He began singing his death song, and when his hands were free, stabbed one of his guards with a knife he had secreted in his clothes, and managed to wrestle the man's rifle from him. Satank was shot to death before he could manage to fire. His body lay unburied in the road, with his people afraid to claim it, for fear of the Army, though Col. Ranald S. Mackenzie assured the family they could safely claim Satank's remains. Nonetheless, they were never claimed, and he lies now at Fort Sill. At his trial Satanta warned what might happen if he was hanged: \\"I am a great chief among my people. If you kill me, it will be like a spark on the prairie. It will make a big fire - a terrible fire!\\" Satanta was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Judge Soward ordered that Satanta \\"be taken by the Sheriff of Jack County and hanged until he is dead, dead, dead and God have mercy on his soul.\\" However, the same judge also wrote to Texas Governor Edmund J. Davis recommending commutation to life in prison. Governor Davis, under enormous pressure from leaders of the so-called Quaker Peace Policy, decided to overrule the court and the punishment was changed to life imprisonment. Satanta was freed after two years of imprisonment at the Huntsville State Penitentiary in Texas. ==Release, recapture, and death at Huntsville== Huntsville Unit, where Satanta was incarcerated After a long and hard dealing with the U.S. Government officers, in 1872 Guipago was allowed to meet his friend Satanta and the young war chief Ado-ete in St. Louis, and only after this he accepted to go to Washington with some other Kiowa, Comanche, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Wichita and Delaware chiefs and talk about peace with President Ulysses S. Grant; after Satanta and Ado-ete were temporarily paroled, Guipago led the Kiowa delegation to Washington in September 1872, and got Indian Commissioner E.P. Smith's promise to release the two captives. Satanta and his companion were definitively released only in September 1873, Guipago having made clear to Indian agent James M. Haworth that his patience was now at its end. Soon after their release, Satanta and Ado-ete, along with Guipago and Tsen-tainte (White Horse) were involved in attacking buffalo hunters and were present at the raid on Adobe Walls. But the Kiowa People deny Satanta was involved in that battle, other than being present. He yielded up his war lance and other symbols of leadership to younger, more aggressive men. But his very presence at the Battle violated his parole, and the government called for his arrest. He surrendered in October 1874, and was returned to the state penitentiary at Huntsville, Texas. Guards reported that Satanta, forced to work on the road, would stare for hours at the traditional hunting grounds of his people, and seemed to wither away. In his book, the History of Texas, Clarance Wharton reports of Satanta in prison > After he was returned to the penitentiary in 1874, he saw no hope of escape. > For a while he was worked on a chain gang which helped to build the M.K. & > T. Railway. He became sullen and broken in spirit, and would be seen for > hours gazing through his prison bars toward the north, the hunting grounds > of his people. Satanta was buried in the prison cemetery, now known as the Captain Joe Byrd Cemetery in Huntsville, until 1963 In the end, deciding not to spend the rest of his life in prison, Satanta killed himself on October 11, 1878, by diving headlong from a high window of the prison hospital. Satanta was originally buried in the prison cemetery in Huntsville. In 1963 his grandson, an artist named James Auchiah, received permission to transfer Satanta's remains to Fort Sill, Oklahoma.\\"Santanta.\\" Handbook of Texas; retrieved October 26, 2010. In October 2000, Satanta's shield, bow and bow case, and arrows and quiver were returned to Fort Sill and dedicated by a ceremony that included the Fort Sill commander and Kiowan armed services veterans.The Long Journey Home Dedication Ceremonies for the Return of Set'tainte's Shield and Weapons The character of Blue Duck in Larry McMurtry's Pulitzer Prize winning novel Lonesome Dove was partially based on the life and death of Satanta. The actor Rodolfo Acosta played Satanta in 1959 in the third episode of the ABC western television series, The Rebel, starring Nick Adams. ==See also== *Texas-Indian Wars *Warren Wagon Train Raid *First Battle of Adobe Walls *Second Battle of Adobe Walls *Guipago *Satank *Dohasan *Tene-angopte ==References== ==External links== *Satanta page at Texas State Library & Archives Commission * Category:1874 in the United States Category:1820s births Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1878 deaths Category:American people who died in prison custody Category:American prisoners sentenced to death Category:Battles involving the Comanche Category:Kiowa people Category:Military personnel who committed suicide Category:Native American leaders Category:Native American people of the Indian Wars Category:People who committed suicide in prison custody Category:Prisoners sentenced to death by Texas Category:Prisoners who died in Texas detention Category:Suicides by defenestration Category:Suicides by jumping in the United States Category:Suicides in Texas Category:Texas–Indian Wars ","title":"Satanta (Kiowa leader)"},{"id":"3242533","text":"The Peruvian night monkey (Aotus miconax), also known as the Andean night monkey, is a nocturnal New World monkey endemic to northern Peru. Adults weigh around and measure up to in length. Its colour is grey to light brown with characteristic black and white markings on the face. The chest, belly and upper arms are orange tinged, however, to a lesser extent then Aotus nigriceps. The species is one of the least known and possibly rarest Neotropical primates. This species is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN and endangered under Peruvian Law. The Peruvian night monkey is also one of the least studied of all primates. The only data that exists about this species are museum specimens, sighting records and very basic ecological information. The species is thought to inhabit areas of cloud forest at above sea level in the departments of Amazonas, Huanuco and San Martin, and in border regions of neighboring departments. ==Behavior== The species is monogamous and lives in small family groups of 2 to 6 individuals similar to that of other Aotus species. Hardly any data exists on the dietary requirements of A. miconax, but it is known that it is generally frugivorous but also consumes leaf buds and insects. This species has been observed in primary and secondary forest, from large areas of contiguous forest to small forest patches. ==Threats and conservation== The main threat facing the Peruvian night monkey is the continued growth of human populations and associated habitat destruction. Hunting is a lesser threat to this species, but it is still hunted for the pet trade and by trophy hunters.Shanee, N., Shanee S., and Collongues, H. (2008).

It is said that he was given his name for the way he fought his enemies. He was a Kiowa, though his grandfather had been a Crow captive who was adopted by the Kiowa. His mysterious death at Fort Sill on May 3, 1875 is the subject of much debate and speculation. Though he was a great warrior who participated in and led many battles and raids during the 1860s and 1870s, he is mostly known as an advocate for peace and education in his tribe. He enjoyed close relationships with whites, most notably the Quaker teacher Thomas Battey and Indian Agent James M. Haworth. The close relationships he enjoyed with whites engendered animosity among many of the Kiowas, making him a controversial figure. He would become the most prominent peace chief of the Kiowas, following the lead of a previous head chief, Dohasan. Kicking Bird was diplomatically active and signed the Little Arkansas Treaty of 1865 and the Medicine Lodge Treaty of 1867 and was instrumental in moving his people to reservations. ==Early life (1835–65)== At the time of Kicking Bird's birth in 1835, the Kiowas inhabited the Texas Panhandle, western Oklahoma, and southwestern Kansas. Not much is known of his early life, but he participated in the Kiowa warrior tradition and was a renowned warrior and hunter. His early success qualified him as an \\"onde,\\" or Kiowa warrior supreme, granting him first-rank social status in his tribe. In addition to an outstanding war-record, to be an \\"onde\\" required that a man be wealthy, generous, aristocratic in demeanor, and an imposing presence on horseback – all qualities possessed by Kicking Bird. Adobe Walls Battlefield He fought against the Utes of Colorado, Pawnees of Nebraska, Navajos of New Mexico, and in raids along the Santa Fe Trail where he may have been shot in 1864. On November 25, 1864, Kicking Bird, then a member of Dohasan's band of Kiowas, fought alongside Kiowas, Comanches, Apaches, and Arapahoes as Colonel Christopher \\"Kit\\" Carson's regular troops collided with the Indian forces in the Battle of Adobe Walls. As Kicking Bird matured, he recognized the futility of the raiding that dominated Plains Indian societies during the 19th century and adopted a conciliatory leadership approach that focused on cultivating friendly relationships with whites. He rose to prominence in his late 20s and was acknowledged as a promising young Kiowa in 1859 by James Brice, who wrote \\"Kicking Bird was said to be a good Indian by white men that knew him and would some day become influential with his people and the government.\\" Kicking Bird was noticeably absent from Kiowa peace treaties of the late 1850s and early 1860s, most likely because he had yet to earn his status as a Kiowa chief. It was not until 1865, around the age of 30, that Kicking Bird would become a Kiowa sub-chief. A series of clashes between the Plains tribes and white settlers, such as the Sand Creek Massacre, induced peace talks in 1865. It is during this period of diplomacy between whites and Indians that Kicking Bird began to make his mark in a peaceful leadership position. He first emerged into public consciousness when he signed the Little Arkansas Treaty in 1865. He was especially active in returning white captives as evidence of good intentions while the terms of the Little Arkansas Treaty were being discussed. The Little Arkansas Treaty moved the major Plains Indians Tribes to reservations which were never entirely established, and which were later reduced in size by the Treaty of Medicine Lodge; also, promised annuities were never distributed. These two issues would have long-lasting implications that Kicking Bird and other Kiowa chiefs would wrestle with in the following years. ==Later life (1865–75)== ===Political involvement=== After Dohasan's death in 1866, Satanta (White Bear), Guipago (Lone Wolf), and Kicking Bird became locked in an intense rivalry for leadership of the Kiowa. War leaders Guipago (named by Dohasan himself as his heir) and Satanta were the clear favorites over the younger Kicking Bird (Tene-angopte), but it was apparent that Kicking Bird, together with medicine-man No Mocassins (Napawat), was the foremost advocate for peace, taking up Dohasan's role as peace leader of the Kiowas. His calm and conciliatory demeanor facilitated an open relationship with whites, who admired him for his skills as an orator and diplomat. At Fort Dodge in 1866, commanding officer Henry Douglas stated that \\"Kicking Bird was the most reliable of all the Indians.\\" Kicking Bird's first actions as sub- chief were for peace, but he was primarily concerned with the annuity situation. When the Kiowa had moved onto the reservations, they had been promised annuity payments for buying food and supplies; however, the annuities were not always paid as promised, and were being handled by a corrupt agent who hampered the promised flow of goods. The Kiowa faced immense hardship as a result. Kicking Bird recognized that most of the bad feelings in his tribe stemmed from the annuity situation. Because of this, Kicking Bird was placed in a delicate position between warriors who wanted to go on the warpath and those that wanted peace with the whites. His close relationship with whites and peace-talks belittled his leadership position in the eyes of many Kiowa. As a result, after the head chief Guipago, Satanta emerged in a prominent leadership role among his people, and his reputation as a war-maker made him the dominant Kiowa figure to be reckoned with in the eyes of whites and other Indians. Indian-white friction resurfaced following the Little Arkansas Treaty, and Kicking Bird was influential in maintaining peace, proving himself receptive to both Indian and white demands. The terms of the treaty were largely unfulfilled and hostilities throughout the Plains necessitated a new peacemaking treaty: the Treaty of Medicine Lodge. Alongside older and wiser chiefs like Black Kettle and Ten Bears, Kicking Bird realized the futility of militant opposition. During discussions at Medicine Lodge, he was prominently seated in the council circle and worked for a resolution of the annuity situation, but Satanta ultimately stood out as the leading Kiowa chief after the head chief Guipago. Kicking Bird was one of the first signatories of the Treaty of Medicine Lodge; Satanta too signed the treaty, but Guipago refused to do it. The Treaty of Medicine Lodge moved the Kiowa onto a reservation and promised annuities of food, clothes, equipment, weapons, and ammunition. The promised annuities were rarely fulfilled, however, which engendered tribal animosity toward the reservations and assimilation policies. This dissatisfaction was a central obstacle to Kicking Bird's peace efforts. ===Obstacles to peace and prestige=== As a result of the Battle of Washita, General Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer arrested Guipago and Satanta and took them to Fort Sill. In 1869, Kicking Bird helped to obtain the release of Guipago and Satanta from army captivity after promising good behavior on their part. During the interim period, Kicking Bird figured prominently as a leading Kiowa chief. In response to the lack of annuities and tribal land, the Kiowa and their contemporaries resorted to looting and plundering throughout the Plains, which undermined Kicking Bird's efforts towards peace. On January 15, 1870, a body of Kiowas under Satanta intercepted a Texas herd driven by Jacob Hershfield and robbed the drovers of money and supplies before killing some 150-200 head of cattle. Kicking Bird arrived on the scene and defused the situation. Hershfield accounted that had it not been for Kicking Bird, he and his men would have died. Kicking Bird received intense criticism for his close relationships with white people and his renunciation of hunting and advocation of farming. The ranks of warring chiefs Satanta and Guipago swelled in comparison and Kicking Bird lost much tribal support. When the Kiowas hosted a sun dance to celebrate the Summer Moon of 1870, many warriors talked of staying out on the Plains instead of living on reservations with inadequate annuities. Kicking Bird spoke strongly against this and urged that the tribes cultivate friendly relations with the whites and continue to live on reservations. Though a chief, Kicking Bird received much scorn during the sun dance from young Kiowas, and the lack of respect was evident. They said \\"he had been a great warrior before the white men penned him up on the reservation. Now he talked like a woman.\\"Brown, 248. ===Battle of Little Wichita River=== Responding to claims that he was a coward and had become effeminate, Kicking Bird assembled a war party and invited some of his chief critics and worst tormentors to participate - Guipago, Tsen-tainte (White Horse), and Satank. Kiowa Old Man Horse accounted \\"Chiefs hostile to him said to him, ‘Kicking Bird, if you don't quit opposing us, we are going to kill you.' He said, ‘Alright go ahead.' ‘Kicking Bird,' they said, ‘you are nothing but a low-down unrecognized man, no longer a chief.' Kicking Bird said, ‘It may be true, but I am trying to put you in a good road which will be a protection for the lives of the women and children.'\\" Kicking Bird expressed his regret at having to prove himself in battle, but acquiesced nonetheless. In July 1870, his war party, some 100 strong, crossed the Red River into Texas and confronted a Kansas-bound herd in Montague County, Texas, taking horses, mules, blankets, and other property. A few of his braves broke away from the war party and captured a mail stage at Rock Station, provoking a response from nearby Fort Richardson. On July 12 Captain Curwen B. McClellan and several of his officers from the Sixth Cavalry attacked Kicking Bird's encampment near present-day Seymour, Texas. In a long battle under a hot sun, Kicking Bird displayed his military genius and his right to his chieftaincy after thoroughly defeating McClellan's forces by engaging the soldiers in a frontal skirmish and sending two pincer columns to flank his enemy and strike the rear.Brown, 249. In the battle, he was said to have personally lanced one soldier. The Battle of Little Wichita River reaffirmed Kicking Bird's martial acumen and also reinforced his status as Kiowa chief. His victory marked the end of his military career and he expressed regret that tribal divisions forced his hand in the battle. He would spend the rest of his life cultivating peace with whites. The schism between peace-minded and war-minded Kiowa leaders was exacerbated by the increased presence of the U.S. military and Quakers by the end of 1870. Kicking Bird was clearly the foremost advocate for an accommodation with the United States, but was opposed by Satanta, Guipago, Ado-ete (Big Tree), Maman-ti, and Tsen-tainte. He represented the Kiowa peace- faction in numerous intertribal meetings and promised that the Kiowa would live respectfully on the land, but again stressed that without the necessary annuities from the government, his people were forced to stray from the reservations to survive. ===Warren Wagontrain Raid=== In 1871, a ten-wagon mule train moving through Texas was attacked by some 100 Kiowa and Comanche warriors under the direction of Satanta, Satank, and Maman-ti.Hamilton. The motive behind the attack was clearly the annuity situation. As a result, General William T. Sherman ordered the arrest of Satanta, Big Tree, and Satank, and this was done in spite of the willingness to fight for their liberty unequivocally proclaimed by Guipago. A historic trial ensued. Kicking Bird became the prominent Kiowa spokesmen. General Sherman spoke to Kicking Bird: \\"Kicking Bird, the President has heard of you. He knows your name and has written about you. We are all depending on you.\\" Kicking Bird did all he could to save Satanta, Big Tree, and Satank, but his efforts were ultimately futile and he acquiesced to their arrest. Following the arrest, Guipago stubbornly worked in confrontation with government agents, showing his willingness to reject Washington's \\"peace\\" and fight like a traditional Kiowa warrior, while Kicking Bird worked to calm his tribesmen as the three chiefs were transferred to Fort Richardson. The difficulties of 1871 placed Kicking Bird in a top leadership position, and he was recognized as the leading Kiowa peace chief by the U.S. government and a large portion of the Kiowa as well. ===Efforts towards conciliation, 1871–73=== Over the next two years Kicking Bird worked to obtain the release of Satanta and Big Tree. He participated in numerous assemblies as a representative of the Kiowa alongside Guipago, and promised to restore peace among the Kiowa. He demonstrated his good intentions by returning white prisoners to the Wichita agency and discouraging his people from taking the war path. However, with tensions still soaring after the arrest of Satanta, Big Tree, and Satank, Kicking Bird was able to achieve little success. Kicking Bird engaged in numerous activities to placate Texas governor Edmund J. Davis, who was strongly opposed to releasing Satanta and Big Tree. Many Kiowas followed his example and acknowledged that peace was the only viable option for release. The Kiowas returned captives and livestock without ransom, and even offered to rescue captives from other tribes. For his conciliatory work among the tribes, Kicking Bird received a silver medal. In some instances, Kicking Bird threatened not only his own warriors but war parties from other tribes as well in order to stop the raiding. During a June 1873 sun dance, Kicking Bird personally prevented a major Indian outbreak. Discouraged about Satanta and Big Tree's imprisonment, many chiefs clamored for a multitribal assault on the outside forces. Kicking Bird spoke against military action and urged patience. The excitement abated, and the chiefs agreed to wait. This meeting was maybe the closest the Plains tribes would ever come to a multi-tribal assault. Finally, on October 7, 1873, Satanta and Big Tree were released, a result of Guipago's straightforward explanation to Indian agent James Haworth that the patience of his Kiowa warriors, as well as his own, was wearing thin after the Kiowa had lived up to their promises by remaining peaceful in the summer of 1873. According to his apologists, Kicking Bird's skillful negotiation in the release of Satanta and Big Tree earned him the loyalty of nearly two-thirds of his tribesmen. ===Head chief=== Kicking Bird's adeptness as a peace leader could not prevent his tribe's immense dissatisfaction with conditions on the reservations, and, in late 1873, the Kiowa once again took the warpath. In the midst of the fighting, Guipago's favorite son was killed in a raid. Guipago, who had walked the peace path, was now indisposed, and with Satanta removed from his position as war chief, which he had lost while imprisoned, Kicking Bird was supported by the U.S. authorities as head chief of the Kiowas. Kicking Bird was successful in keeping his followers on the reservation, but Guipago's scorn towards the \\"road of peace\\" and attitude towards that of war severely undermined Kicking Bird's efforts at pacification. On June 27, 1874, a consolidated force of warriors launched an attack that would become known as the Second Battle of Adobe Walls. Guipago and Satanta were among the Kiowas participating in the skirmish. Following the battle, Kicking Bird and Satanta were in favor of making peace, but Guipago and several other chiefs refused and advocated war against the whites. Kicking Bird worked earnestly to keep his people unified and avoid conflict, but both of his goals proved elusive. In response to the increase of Indian raids throughout the Plains, the United States War Department overrode the Quaker Indian peace policy and issued orders to separate the Kiowas into two groups of friendly and unfriendly Kiowa. True to his word, Kicking Bird led three-fourths of the Kiowa back to their reservation at Fort Sill, which had become a city of refuge for his people. Meanwhile, Indian hostilities continued and Kicking Bird actively sought to pacify the raiding Kiowas and protect them from punishment. He succeeded in bringing six chiefs and 77 tribespeople, who surrendered their arms, to the reservation. Meanwhile, the hostile chiefs led the remainder of the Kiowa westward with the objective of reaching safe haven at Palo Duro Canyon, while the U.S. Army followed at their heels. When Satanta stepped down as war chief in late 1874, to be arrested immediately thereafter, and Guipago surrendered early the next year, Kicking Bird became the only remaining Kiowa chief with a sizable following. Consequently, the U.S. Army gladly named him Kiowa principal chief in 1875. Throughout late 1874 and early 1875, Kicking Bird assisted the Army with their efforts to track the hostile Kiowas. Fort Marion where hostile Kiowa were sent for incarceration. As chief and the principal intermediary between federal authorities and his tribe, Kicking Bird was put in charge of the Kiowa captured in the 1874-1875 uprising. When it was decided that some of the hostile Kiowa would be sent to Florida for incarceration at Fort Marion, Kicking Bird was required to choose which of his tribesmen would go. This greatly disturbed Kicking Bird, who considered it no easy chore but ultimately in the best interest for peace. He reluctantly chose Guipago, Maman-ti (Walking-above), Tsen-tainte (White Horse), and 23 other Kiowas, while Satanta was sent back to Huntsville. Comanches, Cheyennes, Arapahoes, and Mexican captives were also sent to Fort Marion, for a total of about 70 prisoners. His acquiescence to the demands of the army was interpreted as treason by many members of his tribe, but others grudgingly accepted Kicking Bird's action as a peace measure. ==Education== Kicking Bird was the foremost Kiowa advocate for education and enjoyed a close relationship with Quaker teacher Thomas C. Battey. Kicking Bird and Battey first met on February 18, 1872 and in later meetings Kicking Bird requested that Battey, or Thomissey as he was known, teach his daughter Topen and live among the Kiowa. Battey was understandably fearful of the Kiowa, but was reassured in numerous meetings with Kiowa leaders that the Quaker would be greeted with friendship and peace. After waiting for tensions to settle among the Kiowa, Kicking Bird agreed to take Battey back with him to his camp. Kicking Bird's brother Ze'bile invited Battey to share his lodge and Battey soon began teaching. The first Kiowa classes opened on January 23, 1873 and were hampered by a language barrier and intrusive and curious onlookers. Early on, Battey faced some opposition but was protected by Kicking Bird and other chiefs. Kicking Bird's interest in schooling for the Kiowa children was paramount in bringing education to his tribe but in the context of the assimilation policy, not all Kiowa welcomed white education. With many influential Kiowa following the path of formal education for Kiowa children set by Kicking Bird and Battey, the first school for the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache children of Fort Sill post was established. The school opened on February 27, 1875 and Agent Haworth appointed two chiefs from each of the tribes to serve as a board of education. Forty-four Kiowa and Comanche children were soon enrolled. ==Mysterious death and family== On May 3, 1875 while at Fort Sill, Kicking Bird died suddenly after drinking a cup of coffee. Around 40 years old, Kicking Bird received a Christian burial at Fort Sill, where his unmarked grave remains. He is buried alongside many notable Kiowa leaders: Satank, Satanta, Stumbling Bear, Big Bow, Hunting Horse, and Quanah Parker.Schnell, 168. Numerous accounts of Kicking Bird's death have surfaced but none have proven conclusive. The most popular story maintains that Kicking Bird was poisoned by a vindictive tribesman. It was widely assumed that, with his death occurring relatively soon after the departure of the Fort Marion prisoners, an angry Kiowa or a white who stood to gain from the chief's death slipped poison into his coffee. One account holds that Kicking Bird may have been poisoned by one of his wives for having delivered her brother to Fort Marion. Another story maintains that the medicine man Maman-ti placed a hex of death on Kicking Bird for his role in naming prisoners to be sent to Fort Marion, himself included. Most contemporary Kiowas accepted this legend, though it too proves inconclusive. Had Maman-ti's hex of death been successful, he would have perished three days after Kicking Bird. Instead, his death came on July 29, 1875 (three months after Kicking Bird's), and may have been the result of the close confinement within the walls of the old Spanish Fort. Still another account of Kicking Bird's death maintains that something may have been wrong with his heart that caused his death. Agent Haworth noted that the night before his death, Kicking Bird had been up late and told someone that \\"his heart felt just like someone had hold of it pulling it out.\\" The next morning, as was custom for almost all diseases, Kicking Bird went to the creek and came back after he felt better. Shortly after coming out of the water and having a cup of coffee, Kicking Bird died. This version fits descriptions in modern medical science of someone having a heart attack, but is not conclusive. Kicking Bird had a daughter, Topen, as well as five other children, with his first wife, who died in 1872. After he remarried in 1874, he had a son Little John, who was ten months old when Kicking Bird died. His known brothers were Pai-Talyi' (Son-of-the-Sun, or Sun Boy), Ze'bile (Big Arrow), and Coquit. His father was Andrew Stumbling Bear. ==See also== *Dohasan *Satank *Guipago *Satanta *Zepko-ete *Mamanti *Tsen-tainte *Ado-ete ==References== ==Bibliography== *Brown, Dee Alexander.

It is found in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. The Spix's night monkey is a small bodied monkey species usually having a mass of around one kilogram. It belongs to the only nocturnal genus of New World primates Aotus. This type of monkey can leap farther than most due to it having longer arms than legs. The monkey averages 0.5 meters in height. The night monkey is considered to be a new world monkey.\\"Aotus: The Owl Monkey's Natural History.\\" KCCMR . Web. 8 Dec. 2015. The social behavior of the Aotus vociferans is group based. These groups usually consist of breeding pairs and their offspring. This species has a monogamous mating system. After the offspring are born, the father becomes the main caretaker, only giving up the offspring for them to suckle. The offspring will usually stay with their birth group until they reach two and a half to three and a half years old. An exception to this if the male breeding partner is no longer present for any reason (usually only caused by death), then the offspring may stay with its birth group for only twelve weeks to the normal departure age. Social grooming in this species of monkey is uncommon.\\"Spix's Owl Monkey (Aotus Vociferans).\\" Spix's Owl Monkey (Aotus Vociferans) . 25 Apr. 2007. Web. 8 Dec. 2015. The Aotus vociferans reproduce usually by giving birth to one offspring. Although, like with humans, there are cases of twins. The female breeding partner carries the offspring in interbirth for around one year. Both mating and birthing occur between November and January. For this species, copulation attempts tend to be short and quick, starting with the male and female approaching one another. Then the male performs a social sniff. During the original sniff, the female may reciprocate but not always. Sexual intercourse usually consists of only three to four thrusts by the male with him ejaculating on the final thrust. This species moves through the forest by swinging between horizontal branches and uses all four limbs to grab branches. They may also leap from tree to tree. This species communicates through voice, sight, smell, and touch. Vocally, this monkey has different sounds for different situations. To startle a potential predator the night monkey will “scream,” emitting a high pitched shriek. These monkeys use social sniffing to assess potential breeding partners. They will also urinate on their hands and then rub it on different surfaces to show sexual attraction. Aggressive males will usually arch their backs with all of their limbs straightened. When in the presence of a predator the night monkey will sway from side to side to try and deter the predator. A rejection bite is used as tactile communication between mother and offspring after suckling or after around one week old when contact is not welcome. Father and offspring also use a rejection bite when the offspring reaches around 8 weeks when contact is not welcome.Cawthon Lang KA. 2005 July 18.

Satank (Set-angya or Set- ankeah, translated as chief Topinabee A quiet Sitting Bear) was a prestigious Kiowa warrior and medicine man. He was born about 1800, probably in Kansas, and killed June 8, 1871. An able warrior, he became part of the Koitsenko (or Kaitsenko, Ko-eet-senko), the society of the bravest Kiowa warriors. He led many raids against the Cheyennes, the Sacs, and the Foxes. As the white settlers' importance increased, he raided settlements, wagon trains, and even army outposts. ==Background== In 1860 Satank was a frequent visitor at the Peacock Ranch near present-day Great Bend, Kansas. Satank asked Mr. George Peacock to write a letter of introduction (begging paper) saying that Satank was a good Indian. Peacock took advantage of Satank's illiteracy, and instead wrote that Satank was a bad Indian. When the Chief learned about the trick from Buffalo Bill Mathewson, Satank's tribe killed Peacock and several other people at Peacock Ranch.Bernard Bryan Smyth, The Heart of the New Kansas, Great Bend, Ks, B. B. Smyth, 1880, p. 82.The Ranch at Walnut Creek Crossing by Louise Barry, Summer 1971 == Struggle for power after death of the Kiowa chief Little Mountain (Dohäsan) == Satanta, or \\"White Bear\\" Guipago, or \\"Lone Wolf\\" Ado-ete, or \\"Big Tree\\" After the death of the Kiowa supreme chief Dohäsan in 1866 Guipago was selected as the new head chief, Satanta took over the leadership as war chief, with Satank leading the Koitsenko; Tene-angopte (Kicking Eagle), together with Napawat (No Mocassins) was the leader of the white-friendly party. 1867 Satank signed the Medicine Lodge Treaty together with Satanta and other Kiowa chiefs (but not Guipago, who refused to sign). ==Last years and Warren wagon-train affair== In 1870 his son, also named Satank, was killed in a raid in Texas. Disconsolate, the old man carried some of his son's bones with him. He stepped up his raiding, in retribution for his son's death, including many conducted by Satanta and other discontented Kiowa, Comanche and Apache tribes, including the Warren Wagon Train Raid, on May 18, 1871 on Salt Creek Prairie in Texas. The survivors of the Warren train had rushed on to Fort Richardson, where they encountered General William Tecumseh Sherman, who had passed by the raiding party as it lay hidden waiting for the wagon train. The General, realizing that he had escaped death by fate, ordered Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie and the 4th Cavalry to pursue the war party and bring back those responsible for the attack.Texas State Libraries & Archives Commission, Satanta The Army did not catch the war party, the war party caught themselves. Leaders Satank and Satanta had come back to the reservation, and had they kept quiet, no one would have ever found out officially who had committed the Warren Wagon Train Raid. But Satanta could not bring himself to be quiet. He asked the Indian Agent on the Kiowa-Comanche Reservation for ammunition and supplies, bragging that he, Satank, and young war leader Ado- ete (Big Tree) had led the war party which had recently killed the teamsters at Salt Creek, and that they could have killed General Sherman if they had wished. Sherman, already enraged over the acts of the war party, was further enraged to hear that he could have been killed. He ordered the arrest of Satank, Satanta, and Big Tree, and personally carried it out on the Agent’s porch, in spite of Guipago's intervention (the head chief came in well equipped with loaded rifle and guns, fit to fight for his friend's liberty, but had to surrender in front of the massive presence of military troops). Sherman then hit on the ingenious idea of sending the Indian Chiefs to Jacksboro, Texas to be tried in state court for murder. He ordered them tried as common felons by the Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District of Texas. This would deny them any vestige of rights as a prisoner of war, which they might keep in a military court martial, and send a message that acts by a war party would be regarded as common crimes rather than legitimate resistance by representatives of a sovereign state. This would mark the first time Indian Chiefs had ever stood trial in the white man’s court. ==Trial of Satanta and Big Tree - first Indian leaders tried in state court == General Sherman ordered the trial of Satanta and Big Tree, along with Satank, making them the first Native American Leaders to be tried for raids in a US Court.Texas State Historical Association, \\"Satanta\\" Sherman ordered the three Kiowa sub-chiefs taken to Jacksboro, Texas, to stand trial for murder. Satank had no intention of allowing himself to be humiliated by being tried by the white man's court, and told the Tonkawa scouts before the three were to be transported to Fort Richardson that they should tell his family they would be able to find his body along the trail. Satank refused to get in the wagon, and after the soldiers threw him in, he hid his head under his red blanket, (worn as a sign of his membership in the Koitsenko). The soldiers apparently believed the old Chief was hiding his face because of humiliation, but in reality, he was gnawing his wrists to the bone so that he could get out of the chains they had put on him. He began singing his death song, and when his hands were free, stabbed and wounded one of his guards - a corporal - White Cloud Kansas chief., July 13, 1871, Image 2 in the leg The Saline County journal., September 21, 1871, Image 1 with a knife he had secreted in his clothes, and managed to wrestle the man's rifle from him.

Nonetheless, they were never claimed. ==Final resting place== Eventually his corpse was buried by the army at Chief's Knoll, on the cemetery at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.Army Digest Satanta was also brought there after his suicide in prison at Huntsville, Texas, and buried nearby.

He was the chief palace architect to the Ottoman Sultan Abdülhamid II in Constantinople for 16 years. == Early years == D’Aronco was born 1857 in the provincial town of Gemona del Friuli, Udine, Italy (now in Friuli, at that time part of the Austrian Empire) into a family of builders for several generations. He completed the Gemona Arts and Trades School after the primary school. At the age of 14, D’Aronco attended the Johanneum Baukunde in Graz, Austria in 1871, a school for construction famous for training skilled masons and joiners, which still exists today. Already knowledgeable after years of practical experience with his father, he proved an outstanding student, and his teachers urged him to study architecture. After his return to Italy with his resolve, D’Aronco enrolled at a summer school of design in Gemona, winning first prize in the competition, which he entered upon completing the second course. D’Aronco then volunteered for military service and worked as a fortifications engineer in Turin, which gave him experience in timber construction. Upon discharge, he entered the Venice Academy of Fine Arts, Accademia di Belle Arti, where the teaching was not confined to any particular school of thought, enabling D’Aronco, whose ideas had not been shaped by any previous architectural education, to experiment freely with form and style. At the Academy, the ideas of Camillo Boito were dominant in design classes, which taught him, how to combine existing environment with other sources. At the end of the year, when he was still only 19 years old and full of enthusiasm, he was awarded first prize for architectural composition. == Career == Raimondo d’Aronco's rise to fame in Italy began with design competition for a monument to King Vittorio Emmanuele II to be built in Rome. His design won the silver medal. Similar achievements at the competitions for the 1887 Venice Exhibition, the First Turin Exhibition of Architecture in 1890 and the Palermo National Exhibition in 1891 made him one of Italy's most promising young architects. In 1893, he was invited to Istanbul to prepare designs for the Istanbul Exhibition of Agriculture and Industry to be held in 1896. He arrived in August 1893, and had completed the project within a few months. Sultan Abdul Hamid II approved the designs, and the foundations were being laid when the great earthquake of 10 July 1894 devastated the city. One of its victims was the exhibition, which had to be scrapped. But in the wake of the earthquake, the need for an architect of Raimondo d’Aronco's standing became even more urgent, as a rebuilding program got underway. He was first charged with restoring damaged monuments in the old city, and went on to design scores of buildings for the government and individuals. The Istanbul period in his professional career only came to an end with the deposition of Sultan Abdülhamid II in 1909. These 16 years were to be the most productive years of his life, and represented the height of his originality. == Major works == Marmara University Haydarpaşa Campus in Istanbul, which was originally built as the Imperial College of Medicine (Mekteb-i Tıbbiye-i Şahane) between 1895 and 1900. Raimondo D'Aronco collaborated with Alexander Vallaury for its design. The building later became the Haydarpaşa High School, before being transferred to Marmara University. Türbe of Sheikh Zafir Efendi (Şeyh Zafir Efendi Türbesi) in the Yıldız quarter of Beşiktaş, Istanbul. A floral front door detail in Casa Botter (Botter Apartmanı, 1900–1901) on İstiklal Avenue in Beyoğlu, Istanbul. D'Aronco designed and built a large number of buildings of various types in Istanbul. The stylistic features of his works can be classified in three groups: Revivalism, reinterpretation of the Ottoman forms, Art Nouveau and Vienna Secession. Art Nouveau was first introduced to Istanbul by d'Aronco, and his designs reveal that he drew freely on Byzantine and Ottoman decoration for his inspiration. D'Aronco made creative use of the forms and motifs of Islamic architecture to create modern buildings for the city. The buildings, which he designed at Yıldız Palace, were European in style. The best known of these are Yildiz Palace pavilions and the Yildiz Ceramic Factory (1893–1907), the Janissary Museum and the Ministry of Agriculture (1898), the fountain of Abdulhamit II (1901), Karakoy Mosque (1903), the mausoleum for the Tunisian religious leader Sheikh Zafir Efendi (1905–1906), tomb within the cemetery of Fatih Mosque (1905), Cemil Bey House at Kireçburnu (1905), clock tower for the Hamidiye-i Etfal Hospital (1906). Casa Botter (Botter Apartmanı) (1900–1901), a seven-story workshop and residence building in İstiklâl Avenue in Beyoğlu, which he designed for the sultan's Dutch fashion tailor M. Jean Botter, represents a turning point in D’Aronco's architecture. This Art Nouveau design in the avant-garde mood of the period compounded D’Aronco's already enviable reputation. While living in Graz at fourteen, he had also found the chance to follow the Austrian Secession more closely than most of his compatriots. Around the same time, he won the Turin International Exhibition of Decorative Arts design competition, which carried his fame into the international sphere. The tiny mescid (little mosque) of Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa Paşa, which stood in Karaköy until modernization projects swept it away in 1958, was another work of comparable note. Among the numerous private houses, which Raimondo d’Aronco designed, is the Huber House (1906) in Tarabya, built for the German weapon traders, Joseph and Baron Auguste Huber brothers of an aristocratic and wealthy family. Since 1985 the official Istanbul residence of the Turkish president. Âli Pasha Mansion (currently the Egyptian Consulate) in Bebek, Istanbul, on the Bosphorus strait. He also built a palace for the sultan's daughter Nazime Sultan, but this is no longer standing. The summer residence for the Italian embassy (1905) in Tarabya is one of the most striking contributions to Istanbul's architectural heritage by D’Aronco. Planned as a classic Italian palace, the building opens directly onto the sea like a Bosphorus house, together with an Italian type interior space. Broad eaves typical of Istanbul vernacular architecture cast deep shade over the terrace. The skilled welding of two cultures testifies to both D’Aronco's interpretive skill and his affection for Istanbul. The Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa Moderna, the International Exposure of Turin, was held 1902 and featured many works in the Art Nouveau including the main exhibition building, or Rotunda, in a Secessionist style, as well as the pavilion devoted to art photography designed by D’Aronco. He presented also a project for the building of the Regional Exposure of Udine of 1903. In the region of his hometown, there are still many of his works, including the Neo-Gothic main cemetery in Cividale (1889), the family tomb in Udine (1898) and the Town Hall in Udine (1911–1930). Raimondo D’Aronco died 1932 in Sanremo, Imperia in Italy. A state institute in Gemona, ISIS Istituto Statale di Istruzione Superiore, is named after him. Part of the merit for the rediscovery of D'Aronco's work is attributed to the Italian architect Manfredi Nicoletti who in 1955 wrote the very first biography on his Art Nouveau drawings and architectures. == See also == * Yıldız Palace == References == * Manfredi Nicoletti, Raimondo D'Aronco, Milano 1955. * Manfredi Nicoletti, D'Aronco e l'architettura libery, Laterza Bari 1982. * Diana Barillari, Raimondo D'Aronco (Gli architetti) 1st edition (1995) Laterza, Italy * Prof. Dr. Afife Batur (Istanbul Technical University Faculty of Architecture) Skylife 03/95, onboard magazine of Turkish Airlines == External links == * Category:1857 births Category:1932 deaths Category:20th-century Italian architects Category:Art Nouveau architects Category:Buildings and structures in Istanbul Category:People from Gemona del Friuli Category:Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia alumni ","title":"Raimondo D'Aronco"},{"id":"3242558","text":"The 195th (City of Regina) Battalion, CEF was a unit in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War.

The Peterson olefination Several reviews have been published.Birkofer, L.; Stiehl, O. Top. Curr. Chem. 1980, 88, 58. (Review)Ager, D. J. Synthesis 1984, 384–398. (Review)Ager, D. J. Org. React. 1990, 38, 1. New developments in the Peterson olefination reaction L. Frances van Staden, David Gravestock and David J. Ager Chem. Soc. Rev., 2002,31, 195-200 ==Reaction mechanism== One attractive feature of the Peterson olefination is that it can be used to prepare either cis- or trans-alkenes from the same β-hydroxysilane. Treatment of the β-hydroxysilane with acid will yield one alkene, while treatment of the same β-hydroxysilane with base will yield the alkene of opposite stereochemistry. ===Basic elimination=== The action of base upon a β-hydroxysilane (1) results in a concerted syn elimination of (2) or (3) to form the desired alkene. The penta-coordinate silicate intermediate (3) is postulated, but no proof exists to date. The mechanism of base-catalyzed elimination of the Peterson olefination Potassium alkoxides eliminate quickly, while sodium alkoxides generally require heating. Magnesium alkoxides only eliminate in extreme conditions. The order of reactivity of alkoxides, K > Na >> Mg, is consistent with higher electron density on oxygen, hence increasing the alkoxide nucleophilicity. ===Acidic elimination=== The treatment of the β-hydroxysilane (1) with acid results in protonation and an anti elimination to form the desired alkene. The mechanism of the acid-catalyzed elimination of the Peterson olefination ===Alkyl substituents=== When the α-silyl carbanion contains only alkyl, hydrogen, or electron-donating substituents, the stereochemical outcome of the Peterson olefination can be controlled, because at low temperature the elimination is slow and the intermediate β-hydroxysilane can be isolated. Once isolated, the diastereomeric β-hydroxysilanes are separated. One diastereomer is treated with acid, while the other is treated with base, thus converted the material to an alkene with the required stereochemistry. Example of the Peterson olefination ===Electron- withdrawing substituents=== When the α-silyl carbanion contains electron- withdrawing substituents, the Peterson olefination directly forms the alkene. The intermediate β-hydroxysilane cannot be isolated as it eliminates in-situ. The basic elimination pathway has been postulated in these cases. ==Variations== Acidic elimination conditions are sometimes not feasible as the acid also promotes double bond isomerization. Additionally, elimination using sodium or potassium hydride may not be feasible due to incompatible functional groups. Chan et al. have found that acylation of the intermediate silylcarbinol with either acetyl chloride or thionyl chloride gives a β-silyl ester that will eliminate spontaneously at 25 °C giving the desired alkene. Corey and co-workers developed a method (sometimes dubbed the Corey-Peterson olefination) using a silylated imine to yield an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde from a carbonyl compound in one step. For an example for its use in total synthesis see: Kuwajima Taxol total synthesis ==See also== * Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction * Tebbe olefination * Wittig reaction ==References== Category:Olefination reactions Category:Carbon-carbon bond forming reactions Category:Substitution reactions Category:Name reactions ","title":"Peterson olefination"},{"id":"3242563","text":"Two Moons (1847–1917), or Ishaynishus (Cheyenne: Éše'he Ôhnéšesêstse),Cheyenne Dictionary by Fisher, Leman, Pine, Sanchez. was one of the Cheyenne chiefs who took part in the Battle of the Little Bighorn and other battles against the United States Army.Curtis, E.

As of August 2017, Mountain continues to skate professionally and his sponsors include Flip, Nike SB, Independent Trucks, Spitfire Wheels, and Bones Bearings. ==Professional skateboarding== ===Powell-Peralta to The Firm=== Lance Mountain took first or second place in almost every amateur contest in which he participated. Mountain's first skateboard deck sponsor was Variflex, a company that he joined in 1981; Mountain then moved to the Powell-Peralta team in the following year(1982). It was during his time with Powell-Peralta that he formed a strong friendship with Stacy Peralta, the team manager and director of the Bones Brigade video series—Mountain appears in eight Bones Brigade videos, including the well-known video The Search For Animal Chin (the final video was the 1991 production Eight). Mountain gained further eminence when he won the Upland Turkey Shoot contest at Upland Skatepark in 1983, an event in which fellow team riders Steve Caballero, Mike McGill, and Tony Hawk also competed. This was followed by Mountain's 1984 appearance in skateboarding's first, full-length company video The Bones Brigade Video Show, in which Mountain filmed the segue segments for all of the \\"vert\\" (a style of skateboarding that involves skateboarding on a vertical \\"u\\"-shaped ramp) and \\"freestyle\\" (a style of skateboarding that involves technical skateboarding on flat ground) parts; the segments depict Mountain as he skateboards throughout the streets of Los Angeles, US. In the early 1990s, the skateboard industry underwent a major transformation; the popularity of street-style skateboarding superseded that of vert skateboarding, thereby diminishing the status of the Bones Brigade while the prominence of the next wave of skaters increased. In 1991, Mountain left Powell-Peralta to cofound his own skateboard company \\"The Firm\\" and, together with former Powell-Peralta teammate Ray Barbee, recruited a team of notable skateboarders that included Bob Burnquist and Rodrigo \\"Tx\\" Teixeira. Following the company's further development, The Firm signed a distribution deal with Blitz Distribution. Following four videos and over a decade of existence, Mountain announced the end of The Firm on March 13, 2006. ===Flip=== Following the demise of The Firm, several former team members were recruited by the Flip company—Mountain, Burnquist, and Teixeira (all three skateboarders appeared in the Flip full-length video Extremely Sorry (2009)). As of March 2013, Mountain and Burnquist continue to be sponsored by Flip. As a team rider for Flip, Mountain is one of the professional skateboarders featured in Tony Hawk's Proving Ground, an appearance that marked Mountain's first appearance in the Tony Hawk series of video games. ===Sponsorship=== As of October 2012, Mountain is sponsored by Flip, Independent Trucks, Spitfire, Nike SB (announced on May 7, 2007), and Stüssy clothing.Nike SB Welcomes Lance Mountain - Transworld Business Magazine ===Influence=== In Transworld SKATEboarding's \\"30 Most Influential Skaters Of All Time\\" list, Mountain was selected in the eighteenth position and Skin Phillips, the Editor-in-chief of the magazine, commended Mountain for his ability to \\"put a smile\\" on the faces of skateboarders over four decades of professional skateboarding. At the time that the list was released in December 2011, Mountain stated in response: \\"I feel like I’ve influenced in the sense that if you want to do it, do it. If you don’t want to do it, don’t do it. But don’t rely on what people are saying you can do or saying what you can’t do.\\" ==Artist== Mountain is a prolific artist and, as of March 2013, a catalog of his work is featured on the official Lance Mountain website, lancemountain.com. The catalog is divided into three sections: \\"Art Shows\\" (a collection of all of the art shows that Mountain has produced, with titles such as \\"Locals Only\\" and \\"Love & Guts\\"), \\"Art Owners\\" (displays photographic portraits of people who own pieces of Mountain's art), and \\"Random Stuff\\" (includes Mountain's work with items such as coffee tables, stencils, and oil paint). In 2011, Mountain and his son contributed pieces to an art exhibition that celebrated the life of Joe Strummer, the former band member of The Clash who died in 2002. Mountain also provided graphics for a Peralta-directed television movie named When Disaster Strikes. ==Inventor== Mountain is often cited as one of the inventors of the fingerboard, as he fashioned the prototype out of cardboard, pencil erasers, and a disassembled Hot Wheels toy in the late 1970s. Mountain's invention was featured in a Transworld Skateboarding magazine article, as well as the Powell Peralta video, Future Primitive. The fingerboard was initially created as a fun do-it-yourself project, for which kitchen sinks were used to emulate pool riding, and has since evolved into a major toy category that has sold multiple millions of units (most prominently under the Tech Deck brand). Together with Caballero, Mountain was the co-designer of the Independent \\"Stage V\\" skateboard truck;Independent Truck Co Mountain is also the co-inventor, with Neil Blender, of the transitional skateboard maneuver the \\"Gay Twist\\". ==Contest history== All contest results are covered in Thrasher Magazine and can be checked at the Thrasher Magazine Archives.Magazine Archives.

A well- known member of the party was Apisai Tora. Presenting itself as a multiracial party representing the interests of Ba Province in particular, it formed part of the Fiji Labour Party-led People's Coalition in the general election of 1999, and won four seats in the House of Representatives. It lost all of its seats in the following election, in 2001, but party stalwart Ponipate Lesavua was appointed to the Senate as one of 8 nominees of Opposition Leader Mahendra Chaudhry. ==Merger with BKV== PANU's chief rival for support in Ba Province was the Protector of Fiji, better known locally as Bai Kai Viti (BKV), with which it merged in 2004 to form the People's National Party (PNP). Following the completion of the merger, PANU and the BKV were both formally deregistered on 23 August 2005. ===Reregistration of PANU=== Not all PANU supporters were happy about the party's dissolution, however, or about the decision of the merged party to participate in the Grand Coalition Initiative Group, an electoral coalition of ethnic Fijian parties seeking to present a united front for the forthcoming election, scheduled for August or September 2006. On 25 November 2005, Lesavua announced that in response to public demand, he and a number of others were spearheading attempts to revive the party and reregister it. The necessary documents would be filed with the Elections Office within a week, Lesavua said. \\"The party is being revived because of the great demand from people at the grassroot level for PANU to contest the 2006 general election, he stated. The Fiji Times reported on 11 January 2006 that Lesavua had made the necessary arrangements the previous week to reregister the party. The failed merger with the BKV had been on the basis of a promise not to enter into any racially exclusive or biased coalition. The breach of this promise was a dangerous trend amongst the majority of Fiji's political parties, Lesavua said. Lesavua condemned the overwhelming dominance of indigenous Fijians in the present Cabinet. \\"Most of those in cabinet are either Fijian or Rotuman even though our country is a multi-racial country,\\" he complained. He said that PANU would promote the principles of justice, love, unity, and fairness, to ensure that all citizens were successful, regardless of their race, religion, or creed. In another twist to the ongoing saga of PANU-BKV relations, Lesavua announced on 23 January 2006 that the BKV, like PANU, had seceded from the PNP and had signed an agreement to merge with PANU, in order to present a united front representing western Fiji. Lesavua also told Fiji Village that the party would be sharing preferences with the Fiji Labour Party and the National Alliance Party. ===New merger with PNP=== Fiji Live revealed on 2 March that the abortive merger of PANU with the PNP had been resurrected. Officials of the PNP and PANU had met over the weekend at the village of Sorokoba, Ba, to formalize a merger of their two parties. \\"In politics there are no permanent enemies and no permanent friends but we hope they understand and they will be informed of the move,\\" PNP leader Meli Bogileka told Fiji Television. It was announced on 5 March that the BKV has also joined the re- merged party, which will contest the 2006 election under the PANU banner. Recapturing the three seats that it won in 2000 would be a priority, said Ponipate Lesavua. Reacting to the merger, Jale Baba, campaign coordinator of the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL), said that it was a sad move. Establishing a party for the purpose of promoting one particular region in Parliament was \\"provincialism\\", he said. ==Towards Election 2006== The Fiji Sun quoted Lesavua on 20 January 2006 as saying that PANU wanted to contest all parliamentary seats - Fijian, Indian, and Open - from Ba Province, and was looking for candidates who would represent all races and both genders. Younger candidates were also being sought, he said. Lesavua defended the notion of a provincial party. \\"Since Ba Province is the power base for the country's economy, there is a need to have a political party for the province's people,\\" he told the Sun. On 27 January, he announced that PANU would give its first \\"preferences\\" to the Fiji Labour Party (Fiji's electoral system allows for transferable voting), and would also cooperate with the United Peoples Party and the National Alliance Party. ===Election result=== The party won at the Fiji election of 2006 1% and no seats. ==Post 2006== Following the military coup of 5 December 2006, the Military-backed interim government required all political parties to reregister in preparation for the 2014 elections. Only two existing political parties did so successfully; PANU was not one of them. It was consequently dissolved and its assets forfeited to the state.

By the mid-1930s his anti-republican prejudices made him a natural opponent of the Popular Front and his speeches showed him to be an anti- communist, anti-Semite, Anti-Freemasonry, and against the parliamentary system. In 1936 General de Castelnau, leader of the FNC, described Henriot as \\"an ardent defender of religion, the family and society.\\"Chadwick, p. 224. At the beginning of World War II, he was strongly anti-German. However, in 1941 Henriot began to support Nazi Germany after it invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, as he hoped for the defeat of Communism, believing that Bolshevism was the enemy of Christianity.Chadwick, p. 225. ==Propagandist== In 1940, after the surrender of France to Germany, Henriot became active as a journalist working for the French government headed by Philippe Pétain which had removed to Vichy.

He developed a war of propaganda against the Free French Forces and the BBC; whose spokesmen were Pierre Dac and Maurice Schumann. Seeking to shape the perceptions of the French government and German occupation, and to destroy popular support for the Résistance, Henriot was given the nickname of the \\"French Goebbels\\". He broadcast twice daily on Radio-Vichy, \\"repeatedly and eloquently attacking all those he considered lukewarm in their attitude to collaboration and calling on all good Catholics to support the German cause in the fight against communism.\\" He continued the propaganda programmes after the Germans were forced, due to the new Allied presence in North Africa, to extend their military occupation in 1942 over Southern France, formerly the Free Zone controlled by the French government at Vichy. He warned the French people about any association with the Allies or \\"terrorists\\" (resistance groups) and countered the arguments of the Free French Forces broadcasting from the BBC.6 World War II Propaganda Broadcasters History.com He wrote and delivered 270 broadcasts on Radio Vichy in a \\"mesmerising rhetoric and delivery\\" ... as a \\"huge media star\\", according to one source.Philippe Henriot and the Last Act of Vichy: Radio Broadcasts, January-June 1944 UK Research and Innovation \\"There is no doubt Henriot's broadcasts were influential, attracting a large and diverse audience.\\" It was said that \\"Henriot is listened to by everyone, enemies or supporters.

Integrated Taxonomic Information System also known as the larga seal or largha seal, is a member of the family Phocidae, and is considered a \\"true seal\\". It inhabits ice floes and waters of the north Pacific Ocean and adjacent seas. It is primarily found along the continental shelf of the Beaufort, Chukchi, Bering and Okhotsk SeasSaundry, Peter (2010). Spotted seal. Encyclopedia of Earth. topic ed. C.Michael Hogan. ed in chief C. Cleveland, National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC and south to the northern Yellow Sea and it migrates south as far as northern Huanghai and the western Sea of Japan. It is also found in Alaska from the southeastern Bristol Bay to Demarcation Point during the ice-free seasons of summer and autumn when spotted seals mate and have pups. Smaller numbers are found in the Beaufort Sea. It is sometimes mistaken for the harbor seal to which it is closely related and spotted seals and harbor seals often mingle together in areas where their habitats overlap. The reduction in arctic ice floes due to global warming led to concerns that the spotted seal was threatened with extinction. Studies were conducted on its population numbers, with the conclusion, as of October 15, 2009, that the spotted seal population in Alaskan waters is not currently to be listed as endangered by NOAA. ==Etymology== The scientific name originated in the Greek word for seal, phoce, and larga, the term used by the Siberian Tungus people for this seal. The English common name is comes from this seal's characteristic dark, irregularly shaped spots. Alaskan Eskimo names include issuriq (Central Alaskan Yup'ik language), gazigyaq in St. Lawrence Island Yupik, and qasigiaq in Inupiaq. ==Description== Spotted seal showing narrow snout like that of a dog The spotted seal is of the family, Phocidae, or \\"true seals\\". Compared to other true seals, they are intermediate in size, with mature adults of both sexes generally weighing between 180 and 240 pounds (81 to 109 kg) and measuring 4.59 to 6.89 ft (1.5 to 2.1 meters), roughly the same size as a harbor seal or ribbon seal. The head of a spotted seal is round, with a narrow snout resembling that of a dog. The spotted seal has a relatively small body and short flippers extending behind the body that provide thrust, while the small flippers in front act as rudders. The dense fur varies in color from silver to gray and white and is characterized by dark, irregular spots against the lighter background and covering the entire body. Males and females differ little in size or shape. In places where their habitat overlaps with that of the harbor seal, they can be confused with them, as in Bristol Bay, Alaska. Like harbor seals, spotted seals have 34 teeth. ==Distribution and habitat== Spotted seal distribution in Bering Sea and surrounding areas Spotted seals are inhabitants of arctic or sub-arctic waters, often in the outer areas of ice floes during the breeding season. They tend not to live within dense drift ice. In the summer months they live in the open ocean or on nearby shores. Spotted seals are separated into three populations. The Bering Sea population includes approximately 100,000 in the western Bering Sea near Kamchatka, in the Gulf of Anadyr in Russia, and in the eastern Bering Sea in Alaskan waters (the only population in the US). A second population of about 100,000 seals breeds in the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk. A third population of about 3,300 seals is to the south in Liaodong Bay, China and Peter the Great Bay, Russia. There is also a smaller population of 300 grey spotted seals living in waters off Baekryeong Island located far north of the west coast of South Korea.In order to prevent the squabble from being fought by water-bombing rocks on Baengnyeong Island, the Hani Sea Water Leopard Artificial Rest Area has been set up. ==Behavior and reproduction== Spotted seals are relatively shy and are difficult for humans to approach. They can be solitary in general but are gregarious and form large groups during pupping and molting seasons when they haul out on ice floes or, lacking ice, on land. The numerically largest groups in Alaska are at Kasegaluk Lagoon in the Chukchi Sea, near Cape Espenburg in Kotzebue Sound, and in Kuskokwim Bay on sandbars and shoals, where several thousand may collect. Sexual maturity is attained around the age of four. January to mid-April is the breeding season. Pup births peak in mid-March. Spotted seals are believed annually monogamous, and during breeding season, they form \\"families\\" made up of a male, female, and their pup, born after a 10-month gestation period. Average birth size is 3 ft (1 m) and 26 lbs. Pups are weaned six weeks later. The maximum lifespan of the spotted seal is 35 years with few living beyond 25. Spotted seals dive to depths up to 1,000 ft (300 m) while feeding on a variety of ocean prey. Juveniles eat primarily krill and small crustaceans while adults eat a variety of fish including herring, arctic cod, pollock, and capelin. They do not seem to vocalize a lot, although not much is known about their vocalizations. They appear to vocalize more while in molting groups. When approached in these groups, they make various sounds such as growls, barks, moans, and roars. Based on satellite tracking conducted on Yellow Sea population, it was revealed that seals migrate more than 3,300 km.점박이물범, 연해주서 중국 발해만까지 이동. yonhapnews.co.kr (2014-01-14) ==Conservation status== On March 28, 2008, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) initiated a status review under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to determine if listing this ice seal species under the ESA was warranted. After an 18-month review of the status of the spotted seal, NOAA announced on October 15, 2009 that two of the three spotted seal populations, together numbering 200,000 seals in or adjacent to Alaska, are not in danger of becoming extinct, nor are they likely to become so in the \\"foreseeable future\\", even though global warming has caused a loss in arctic ice mass. The announcement stated: \\"We do not predict the expected fluctuations in sea ice will affect them enough to warrant listing at this time.\\" In South Korea, spotted seals have been designated Natural Monument No. 331 and second-class endangered species. This is because the seals from South Korea travel to Dalian, China to breed every year where several thousands are harvested for their genitals and sealskin to be sold on the black market for Chinese medicine. An environmental activist group Green Korea United is currently working closely with local Chinese government to stop the seals from being poached by Chinese fishermen.Green Korea United :: Poaching for 1000 Spotted Seals, Wailing of Spotted Seals.

Truluck"},{"id":"3242663","text":"In computer programming, the lexer hack is a common solution to the problems in parsing ANSI C, due to the reference grammar being context-sensitive. In C, classifying a sequence of characters as a variable name or a type name requires contextual information of the phrase structure, which prevents one from having a context-free lexer. == Problem == The problem is that in the following code, the lexical class of \`A\` cannot be determined without further contextual information: (A)*B This code could be multiplication of two variables, in which case \`A\` is a variable; written unambiguously: A * B Alternatively, it could be casting the dereferenced value of \`B\` to the type \`A\`, in which case \`A\` is a typedef name; written unambiguously: (A) (*B) In more detail, in a compiler, the lexer performs one of the earliest stages of converting the source code to a program. It scans the text to extract meaningful tokens, such as words, numbers, and strings. The parser analyzes sequences of tokens attempting to match them to syntax rules representing language structures, such as loops and variable declarations. A problem occurs here if a single sequence of tokens can ambiguously match more than one syntax rule. This ambiguity can happen in C if the lexer does not distinguish between variable and typedef identifiers. For example, in the C expression: (A) * B the lexer may find these tokens: # left parenthesis # identifier 'A' # right parenthesis # operator '*' # identifier 'B' The problem is precisely that the lexical class of A cannot be determined without further context: the parser can interpret this as variable A multiplied by B or as type A casting the dereferenced value of B. This is known as the \\"typedef-name: identifier\\" problem, due to the name of the problematic production rule. == The hack solution == The solution generally consists of feeding information from the semantic symbol table back into the lexer. That is, rather than functioning as a pure one-way pipeline from the lexer to the parser, there is a backchannel from semantic analysis back to the lexer. This mixing of parsing and semantic analysis is generally regarded as inelegant, which is why it is called a \\"hack\\". Without added context, the lexer cannot distinguish type identifiers from other identifiers because all identifiers have the same format. With the hack in the above example, when the lexer finds the identifier A it should be able to classify the token as a type identifier. The rules of the language would be clarified by specifying that typecasts require a type identifier and the ambiguity disappears. The problem also exists in C++ and parsers can use the same hack. == Alternative solutions == This problem does not arise (and hence needs no \\"hack\\" in order to solve) when using lexerless parsing techniques, as these are intrinsically contextual. These are generally seen as less elegant designs, however, because they lack the modularity of having a concurrent lexer and parser in a pipeline. Some parser generators, such as the byacc-derived BtYacc (\\"Backtracking Yacc\\"), give the generated parser the ability to try multiple attempts to parse the tokens. In the problem described here, if an attempt fails because of semantic information about the identifier, it can backtrack and attempt other rules. Based on Berkeley yacc with modifications by Chris Dodd and Vadim Maslov. The Clang parser handles the situation in a completely different way, namely by using a non-reference lexical grammar. Clang's lexer does not attempt to differentiate between type names and variable names: it simply reports the current token as an identifier. The parser then uses Clang's semantic analysis library to determine the nature of the identifier. This allows a much cleaner separation of concerns and encapsulation of the lexer and parser, and is therefore considered by some compiler developers to be a much more elegant solution than The Lexer Hack. This is also the approach used in most other modern languages, which do not distinguish different classes of identifiers in the lexical grammar, but instead defer them to the parsing or semantic analysis phase, when sufficient information is available. == See also == * Dangling else == References == == Citations == * http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smcpeak/elkhound/sources/elkhound/index.html * http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/papers/pldi06.pdf * http://cens.ioc.ee/local/man/CompaqCompilers/ladebug/ladebug-manual- details.html * DOI.org * * http://groups.google.com/group/comp.compilers/browse_frm/thread/db7f68e9d8b49002/fa20bf5de9c73472?lnk=st&q;=%2B%22the+lexer+hack%22&rnum;=1&hl;=en#fa20bf5de9c73472 Category:C (programming language) Category:C++ Category:Parsing Category:Articles with example C code ","title":"Lexer hack"},{"id":"3242676","text":"MI4 was a department of the British Directorate of Military Intelligence, Section 4, part of the War Office. It was responsible for aerial reconnaissance and interpretation. It developed into the JARIC intelligence agency. The present day successor agency to MI4 is the Defence Intelligence Fusion Centre. ==History== MI4 was the codename of an organization that evolved rapidly during and after World War II, including several changes of name. The Photographic Development Unit (PDU) of 1940 became the Photographic Interpretation Unit (PIU) later the same year. The following year it became the Central Interpretation Unit (CIU) and in 1947 became the Joint Air Photographic Intelligence Centre UK (JAPIC (UK)). The role of Aerial Reconnaissance and the codename MI4 were thus subsumed into JAPIC (UK), which continues to the present day, following one further change of name in 1953, as the Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre (JARIC). Its designation as MI4 officially ceased on 8 September 1947, and the title has not endured in common British usage, at least not in the obvious manner that both MI5 and MI6 (also officially defunct titles) have continued to be used colloquially for their respective successor agencies. One key role that the data from MI4 still performs is the avoidance and removal of land mines, as they were heavily mapped in conjunction with the WRAITH initiative during World War II. Some of the data collected by MI4 was subsumed into the IMN (Intelligence Mainframe Network) at Cheltenham. This data has since been absorbed into the aerial reconnaissance unit of GCHQ in Cheltenham, where director Ray Mitinkel oversees the updating process using GPS and satellite photography technology to accurately map the data with real time location to prevent future casualties. After the Second World War MI4 took responsibility for hiring of premises in various parts of the British Empire, disposal of armaments and military equipment no longer required and hence a division named \\"Hirings and Disposals\\" was established. Employees were transferred for short term assignments such as Cyprus, to procure tents and housing for Jews who were prevented from continuing a voyage to settle in Palestine. MI4 officers were also sent to Cairo, their main role being to dispose of post war Military equipment, including demountable camp sites, and armoured vehicles. The role of the officer was to ensure that the buyers of ex-military equipment were not likely to use it against British interests in the region. In 1948 - 52 there was usually only one full-time MI4 officer stationed in each locality including Egypt, Mauritius, and Kenya. ==See also== *RAF Intelligence *JARIC *RAF Medmenham * No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit RAF ==References== * Zabecki, David T.

He went to France in April 1917 and was a lineman with the 1st Artillery Brigade HQ when he was killed at Hill 70, July 31, 1917. Further commentary from one contributor to the publication: \\"But our narrative concerns particularly those who went to the \\"Horses\\" (170th Mississauga Horse Battalion) ... Proceeding overseas in October 1916, two drafts went to France reinforcing the 75th and 58th battalions. The remainder of the 170th was drafted into the 169th battalion and, after a short stay in that unit, the majority transferred to the 116th Battalion. Crossing the Channel with that unit, they landed in Boulogne, France on February 11, 1917. The battalion proceeded immediately up the line and taking the place of the 60th battalion in the third division 9th Brigade, fought through all the engagements in which that division took part in 1917 and 1918. Prominent among these shows were Vimy, Avion, Lens, Passchendaele, Amiens, Arras and Cambrai. The 201st fellows, some forty-one in number, played an important part in their unit, many winning promotions and six being awarded decorations for bravery on the field. But we would pay tribute to those who made the supreme sacrifice, who died gallantly in action, happy in the thought that they had done what they could and that they were giving their lives for others.\\" ==References== Meek, John F.

McGill first performed the maneuvre on a wooden half-pipe in Rättvik, Sweden in 1984 and then at the Del Mar Skate Ranch's concrete bowl, called The Keyhole, when he returned to the United States (U.S.). McGill was inspired by Fred Blood, who had performed a 540 on roller skates, and only a small number of professionals could successfully complete the trick at the time of its invention—Lester Kasai was the second skateboarder to successfully land the McTwist after McGill. McGill recounted his experience in Sweden in a 2004 Thrasher article: > “Okay,” I thought, “if I could just get past the 400-degree mark I could > bail out to my knees and not land on my head.” After a couple dozen tries it > happened and I landed one with speed, just like that ... Before long > everybody showed up, saying, “Okay, let’s see it.” So I did, but it wasn’t > half-way up the wall as they all suspected; it was about four-feet out, > which was actually easier for me to see what I was doing. Lance [Mountain] > proceeded to grab his skate stuff and did a full body jar with his body over > the coping trying it. The next day he took a sequence of it with a single > shot camera for the Bones Brigade Intelligence Report, and made me do it 27 > times in the same spot. Rodney Mullen then named it the McTwist. The trick is derived from a combination of the \\"Mc\\" in McGill and the word \\"twist\\"—twist had previously been introduced by Lance Mountain and Neil Blender, with their invention of the \\"Gay twist\\" (a mute-grab, fakie 360-degree aerial). Inspired by the McTwist, McGill's teammate Tony Hawk invented a 720-degree aerial—a double Gay twist—and, as a homage to McGill, named it the \\"McHawk\\". The trick was groundbreaking when it was first executed and continues to be performed in the 21st century—snowboarding has also adopted the trick and Shaun White was filmed performing a double McTwist on a snowboard at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. ===Bones Brigade=== McGill was a member of the \\"Bones Brigade\\", an elite team of skateboarders that was sponsored by Powell Peralta, who dominated professional skateboarding (in both contests and popularity stakes) for a large part of the 1980s. Led by Stacey Peralta, the team also consisted of Lance Mountain, Tony Hawk, Rodney Mullen, Tommy Guerrero, and Steve Caballero. McGill appeared with Peralta and other Bones Brigades members during the 2012 promotional screenings of the Peralta- directed Bones Brigade documentary, Bones Brigade: An Autobiography. The documentary premiered at the Sundance film festival and a trailer was released in January 2012. ===Post-Bones Brigade=== McGill mainly skated vertical, and when street skating began to dominate the industry, McGill turned to the business side of skating. He started his own skateboard company, \\"Chapter Seven\\" (which is now defunct), and opened his own skate park. As of 2012, he owns a skate shop in Encinitas, California McGills Skateshop, as well as marketing a line of beginners' skateboards, safety equipment and portable skate ramps, rails, and Air Speed skate shoes through Wal-Mart.Search results for mcgill - Walmart ==Contest history== All contest results are covered in Thrasher Magazine and can be checked at the Thrasher Magazine Archives.Magazine Archives.

He also had an acting role as Tommy 'D' in the 1984 Jimmy McNichol action movie Escape from El Diablo, together with fellow skateboarder Steve Caballero.

With his wife, Gwendolyn Stevens, Gardner wrote several books, several pamphlets and other shorter works, and more than 50 articles in the field of psychology. Titles include The Care and Cultivation of Parents, Separation Anxiety and the Dread of Abandonment in Adult Males, Women of Psychology: Pioneers and Innovators, Women of Psychology: Expansion and Refinement, and Red Vienna and the Golden Age of Psychology, 1918-1938. Gardner held teaching, research, and administrative positions at several major universities and various institutes. Among highlights, he was the first chair of the Psychology Department at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, the founder and Executive Director of the Hyperkinesis Clinic in Pasadena, California, and the founder and Executive Director of the Psychological Assessment Laboratory in Santa Ana, California; also, he organized and directed the Psychological Services Department at the Long Beach Neuro-Psychiatric Institute. From 1982 he lived in Connecticut, where he was Chief Psychologist at the Child Guidance Clinic of Southeastern Connecticut before opening a private practice in Mystic in 1991. Gardner wrote and performed the play An Evening with Sigmund Freud and performed in other theatrical and musical events, once being nominated for a Eugene O'Neill award for community theater acting in southeastern Connecticut. He wrote a column for a Cape Girardeau, Missouri newspaper and a monthly column for Professional Selling. Late in life, he wrote several novels. Gardner was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts, the oldest child of Philip and Goldie (Stepanski) Gardner. As the 1952 \\"outstanding graduating student\\" from Everett High School in Boston, he earned a scholarship to Harvard and thus an education his family could not have afforded. After graduating with an A.B., he earned a Ph.D. in clinical psychology at the University of Southern California in 1963, where he studied under J. P. Guilford. He was a longtime member of Rotary International, including service as Secretary of the Mystic, CT chapter. He served on the Board of Directors of the Eastern Connecticut Symphony Orchestra, including one term as Second Vice-President. He served one term as President of the Groton-Mystic chapter of AARP. He was a member of the Vestry of St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Mystic, where he also sang in the choir. Having contracted polio as a child, Gardner overcame the illness, only to have its symptoms recur later in life. He met the recurrence with remarkable strength, continuing to travel widely and to remain, in his words, a \\"fanatical\\" tennis player. Known for a brilliant mind and loved for an inexhaustible sense of humor, Gardner was extraordinarily youthful to the last day of his life.

The officers elected included Lieutenant-Colonel Price as honorary president.Toronto Star - June 7, 1919 The lobby of Old City Hall (Toronto) bears an ornate plaque in honour of the former 204th men who died during their military service in the First World War. 102 names are listed on this plaque, but this may be incomplete.

In case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, a life sentence is issued, even if a single juror opposed death (there is no retrial). Virginia is the state with the shortest time on average between death sentence and execution (less than 8 years). It has executed 113 offenders since 1976 and has just 2 remaining on death row as of December 2018. On November 10, 2009, Virginia executed spree killer John Allen Muhammad for the 2002 D.C. sniper attacks during which 10 people were killed. His death sentence was finalized in six years. The governor has the power of clemency with respect to death sentences. The method of execution is lethal injection, unless the condemned requests electrocution instead. ===Capital crimes=== Under Virginia's Criminal Code, capital murder is defined as \\"willful, deliberate, and premeditated\\" killing involving at least one of the following aggravating factors:Virginia Code § 18.2-31. #Be committed in the commission of abduction, when such abduction was committed with the intent to extort money or a pecuniary benefit or with the intent to defile the victim of such abduction; #Be committed for hire; #Be committed by a prisoner confined in a state or local correctional facility, or while in the custody of an employee thereof; #Be committed in the commission of robbery or attempted robbery; #Be committed in the commission of, or subsequent to, rape or attempted rape, forcible sodomy or attempted forcible sodomy or object sexual penetration; #Be committed against a law-enforcement officer, even of another state or of the federal government, when such killing is for the purpose of interfering with the performance of his official duties; #Be committed against more than one person as a part of the same act or transaction; #Be committed against more than one person within a three-year period; #Be committed in the commission of or attempted commission of drug trafficking; #Be committed pursuant to the direction or order of one who is engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise; #Be committed against a pregnant woman by one who knows that the woman is pregnant and has the intent to cause the involuntary termination of the woman's pregnancy without a live birth; #Be committed against a person under the age of 14 by a person age 21 or older; #Be committed in the commission of or attempted commission of an act of terrorism; #Be committed against a justice or judge when the killing is for the purpose of interfering with his official duties; #Be committed against a witness in a criminal case for the purpose of interfering with the person's duties in such case. ==Modern Era Post-Gregg== After the Supreme Court of the United States upheld Georgia's \\"guided discretion\\" laws in Gregg v. Georgia, Virginia's laws were modified along the same lines. The first person executed after being sentenced to death under these laws was Frank Coppola on August 10, 1982. He was the first of individual executed by the state in the modern era. The electric chair continued to be solely used until 1994, when legislation was enacted giving inmates the choice of lethal injection or the electric chair, with lethal injection the default method if no decision was made. Seven inmates have since opted for the Virginia electric chair; the most recent was Robert Gleason on January 16, 2013. Former Governor Tim Kaine has also stated that he opposes the option of the electric chair, but did not move to drop it as an option while in office. Executions are carried out at Greensville Correctional Center near Jarratt, Virginia; the men's death row is located at the Sussex I State Prison near Waverly, Virginia and the women's death row is at the Fluvanna Correctional Center for Women.Facts about Virginia's Death Row.

Since Governor George Allen signed an executive order on the matter in 1994, relatives of the homicide victim(s) in the case have the right to witness the execution. Relatives of the condemned inmate are barred from being present. In 1992, Roger Keith Coleman was executed by the state for the 1981 rape and murder of his sister-in-law Wanda McCoy. Coleman's case drew national and worldwide attention before and after his execution because of his repeated claims of innocence: Time magazine featured Coleman on its May 18, 1992, cover. After his death, his was the second case nationally in which DNA evidence was analyzed of an executed man. In January 2006, Virginia Governor Mark Warner announced that testing of DNA evidence had conclusively proven that Coleman was guilty of the crime.Maria Gold and Michael D. Shear, \\"DNA Tests Confirm Guilt of Executed Man\\", Washington Post, 12 January 2006; Quote: \\"The testing in Coleman's case marks only the second time nationwide that DNA tests have been performed after an execution.

Lawlor, whose sentence was handed down on June 23, 2011. Lawlor was sentenced to death by the Honorable Randy I. Bellows of Fairfax County Circuit Court. ==Early history== The first recorded execution in the future United States took place in 1608 at the Jamestown Colony in Virginia. Captain George Kendall was executed for treason. Hanging was the predominant method for executions before 1909. Other methods had been used during this time — three people convicted of piracy in 1700 were gibbeted, four pirates were hanged in chains in 1720, and a female slave was burned in 1737. From 1910 until 1994, the electric chair was used for all executions. On February 2, 1951, four African Americans (of the Martinsville Seven) were executed for rape in one case and another was executed for murder in an unrelated case—the most executions held on a single day in Virginia. On February 5, 1951, the remaining three defendants in the rape case were executed.Jim Iovino, \\"Facts About Virginia's Death Row\\", NBC, 10 November 2009. The case of the Martinsville Seven led to scrutiny of racial bias in death penalties for rape in Virginia. Only Black men were executed for rape, de jure through the end of the Civil War, and de facto since the introduction of the electric chair.Eric W. Rise, \\"Race, Rape, and Radicalism: The Case of the Martinsville Seven, 1949–1951\\", Journal of Southern History, LVIII(3), August 1992; accessed via JStor. The youngest person to have been executed in Virginia was Percy Ellis, who at the age of 16 was electrocuted on March 15, 1916. Only two women, Virginia Christian in 1912 and Teresa Lewis in 2010, have been put to death by the state since it took over executions from the counties.

Meeting of the clandestine French Communist Party (PCF) central committee at Longjumeau, 1943. Duclos is second from right. Jacques Duclos (2 October 189625 April 1975) was a French Communist politician who played a key role in French politics from 1926, when he entered the French National Assembly after defeating Paul Reynaud, until 1969, when he won a substantial portion of the vote in the presidential elections. ==Biography== Born in Louey, Hautes-Pyrénées, Duclos fought in the Battle of Verdun, where he was wounded. He was captured at Chemin des Dames, and remained a prisoner of war for the remainder of the war. In 1920, he joined the newly formed French Communist Party. He rose to the Central Committee in 1926, and defeated Léon Blum in the elections for deputy in the 20th arrondissement. He was named head of the propaganda section of the Party in 1936, and was elected to Vice- President of the French National Assembly. A Stalinist, Duclos was for more than 35 years the brain behind political choices made by Maurice Thorez and Benoît Frachon. He was involved in the International Communist Movement, in the Comintern, and in the Cominform. In the 1930s, he was assigned the task of exerting \\"discipline\\" on Communist Movements in Spain (1930, 1935) and Belgium (1934–1935). On Joseph Stalin's orders, he advised the Communist Party of Spain to participate in the Popular Front at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Upon France's defeat in 1940, Duclos, the most senior PCF official in France, engaged in negotiations with the Nazi authorities with a view to legalising the Communist Party (banned following the signature of the Molotov- Ribbentrop Pact and the declaration of war) as well as requesting permission to restart publication of the PCF daily (L'Humanité) (banned by the French government for the same reasons). The negotiations did not succeed but hurt the PCF's post-war credibility among the populace. Duclos was the supervisor of the clandestine party throughout the Nazi German Occupation (1940–44), and, with Pierre Villon, took the initiative in creating the Front National resistance movement, which was the political front for the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP) guerrillas. The Communist Party USA, meanwhile, had been following a Popular Front line under Earl Browder supportive of the New Deal. In fact, Browder had gone so far as to dissolve the Communist Party, and replace it with a \\"Communist Political Association\\" which would work within the existing two-party system to advance Marxist goals. With the end of the Great Power alliance at the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, \\"Browderism\\" came under attack from the rest of the international Communist movement. In 1945 Duclos, as a prominent leader of the French Communist Party, published an article supposedly written by him denouncing Browder's policy (it had actually been written in Moscow, and published secretly there in early 1945, in a magazine restricted to high Soviet Communist officials; the published article was a French translation of the Russian original).Klehr, Harvey, Haynes, John Earl and Kyrill M. Anderson. The Soviet World of American Communism. (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998.) With the Comintern having been dissolved during the war, the \\"Duclos letter\\" was used to communicate informally Moscow's views. CPUSA official Gil Green told interviewer Anders Stephanson: William Z. Foster, Browder's predecessor and a staunch Marxist-Leninist, led the opposition to Browder within the CPUSA and replaced him as party chairman in 1945, with Eugene Dennis taking over as General Secretary. Browder was expelled from the party in 1946. After 1950, Thorez's health faltered, but Duclos remained one of the most influential members of the Party. He was acting Secretary General from 1950 to 1953 in Thorez's absence and was instrumental in eliminating his rival André Marty from the Party's leadership. Waldeck Rochet's own failing health prompted Duclos to run as the Party's presidential candidate in the 1969 election, scoring 21.27% of the vote, the highest ever for a communist presidential candidate in France. He died in Montreuil on 25 April 1975 at age 78. ==References== == External links == * Reprinted in William Z. Foster et al. Marxism-Leninism vs. Revisionism.

It was also a civil parish.The Imperial gazetteer of Scotland. Vol.II. (GORDON-ZETLAND) by Rev. John Marius Wilson. pp.262-263. https://archive.org/stream/imperialgazettee02wilsuoft#page/262/mode/1up == The village == Kirkmichael lies east of Maybole and started life as the focus of a well populated rural parish served by its church. Today it is a largely white harled small village set amid the rolling hills of South Ayrshire, a drive south of central Ayr. Its origins date back to the 13th century when John de Gemmelstoun founded a church beside the Dyrock Burn here, which he dedicated to St. Michael. For much of its early life the village was called Kirkmichael of Gemilston, after its founder, but the name was eventually simplified. The village church dates back to 1787 and is a fairly typical T-plan design intended to provide a large number of seats within a fairly small space, all exposed to the full force of the preacher's oratory. The surrounding churchyard reflects its much greater age, though the attractive lich gate leading to it only dates back to 1702, according to the inscription on its bell. The lich gate was intended to accommodate mourners at funerals. Kirkmichael focuses on two intersecting streets, largely occupied by white cottages built for hand-weavers in the 1790s. The most unusual building is the red stone McCosh Hall in Patna Road. This serves as the village hall and in 1898 was gifted to the village by James McCosh, President of Princeton University, whose family came from this part of Ayrshire. At the junction of Patna Road and Straiton Road lies the white-painted Kirkmichael Arms, a long one-storey village inn. It has a pub, a restaurant and one post office. Kirkmichael House on the south west side of the village is a Scottish baronial mansion dating from the 17th century. It was originally the home of the noble Kennedy family, before becoming a miners' welfare home and a boarding school. ===Notable people=== *John McCosh, army surgeon and photographer, the earliest war photographer whose name is known. *Samuel McGaw, recipient of the Victoria Cross. *John Willet, engineer. Attended the village primary school. == Guitar festival == Kirkmichael was the venue for the Kirkmichael International Guitar Festival. From 1999 until 2005 (except 2004, when the event was not held) for three days in May, Kirkmichael became Scotland's guitar village and played host to thousands of music lovers from around the world. They came together for a weekend catering to all musical tastes from folk to flamenco and jazz to rock and roll. == Industry == The mining industry that dominated much of South Ayrshire left Kirkmichael unscathed. The same cannot be said for many of those employed in the industry, and it is a mark of the village's attractive location and environment that in the early 20th century the large Kirkmichael House, to the south of the village, was converted into a miners' welfare home, while another was opened near Cloncaird Castle to the south east. Both closed in the 1950s. == References == == External links == * *Kirkmichael Village Website *Kirkmichael International Guitar Festival *The Kirkmichael Churchyard, Covenanters, Landowners and VC holders.

It can be found in rain forests, including riverine and seasonally flooded forests. ==Range== The Bolivian red howler is a part of the Atelidae; Atelidae are a subfamily of New World monkey, which includes the various spider and woolly monkeys. They are covered in reddish orange hair. The red howler are found only in neotropical South America in places like Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Perú, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela. They extend from northwest Colombia east and south to the Amazon River in eastern Brazil. They can be largely found in tropical forests, as well as in riverine and seasonally swamped woodlands and in forests above 1000 meters (3280 feet) above sea level, humid and dry forest high terra firma. They stay in the high altitudes.http://www.wildinfo.net/facts/Redhowler.asp ==Body Type== The adult Bolivian red howler has a well-built body that is capable of attaining a maximum body length. Red howler monkeys have a muscular, prehensile tail that enables them to grasp branches or even swing from them. The males are about 20.6 -22.4 inches in height and weigh about 13-17 lbs. The females are a bit smaller at only about 18.4- 19.6 inches and 10-14 lbs.in weight. Their arms and legs are long. The howler hands are strong and dexterous. They feed mostly on leaves and they also enjoy nuts, seeds, fruit, and flowers. http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/alouatta_seniculus/ ==Mating== Female red howler pursues a male howler by showing her tongue. If the male isn't interested, she moves on to another male. Mating occurs throughout the year. After the pregnancy period, which is six months, the female generally gives birth to one offspring at a time. Twins are very rare. Females usually first give birth when they reach five years, which is two years before males begin to mate. Newborns are born with fur and must hang onto their mother’s belly. When baby howlers reach one month they can now hang from their mothers with their tails and can eventually ride on her back when they reach one year. Adults female red howlers in the troop, especially those without an infant, are very fond of other females babies and will cuddle and play with them. The male howlers, on the other hand, are very affectionate to youngsters but only to their own.http://www.theprimata.com/alouatta_seniculus.html ==Behavior== The red howlers live in groups with one to three males, and two to seven females. Males living in bachelor groups attempt to gain control of the female group by fighting the lead male. The male red howler wakes up early in the morning and wakes the forest up with their loud howls that can be heard up to 2 miles. They howl again at night, before they go to sleep, and the calls are answered by males from other red howler groups, to let them know their location so that their territories do not overlap. Red howlers do not like rain, so they howl in protest to the rain while hunched over in the trees. They stay high up in the trees away from jaguars and throw sticks and branches at them. When a troop is invading, males come to take over the female group from the current male or males; they kill all the infants and mate with the females to produce their own offspring. The females try to protect their infants, but being smaller, they usually fail to do so.http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/alouatta_seniculus/ ==Additional Facts== The Red Howler lifespan is 20 years, and their predator is jaguars. They have about six species of red howler in Central and South America, and they sleep for 15 hours per day. They have the loudest call of any new world animal. They are proficient swimmers even though they spend most of their time in the tree. Baby howlers nurse for 18 to 24 months.http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/alouatta_seniculus/ Bolivian red howler near Santa Rosa de Yacuma. ==References== ==External links== * Primate Info Net Red Howler Factsheet *Infonatura * Bolivian red howler Category:Mammals of Bolivia Category:Endemic fauna of Bolivia Bolivian red howler ","title":"Bolivian red howler"},{"id":"3242767","text":"The Amazon black howler (Alouatta nigerrima) is a species of howler monkey, a type of New World monkey, endemic to the south-central Amazon in Brazil.

It is one of the monkey species most often seen and heard in the wild in Central America. It takes its \\"mantled\\" name from the long guard hairs on its sides. The mantled howler is one of the largest Central American monkeys, and males can weigh up to . It is the only Central American monkey that eats large quantities of leaves; it has several adaptations to this folivorous diet. Since leaves are difficult to digest and provide less energy than most foods, the mantled howler spends the majority of each day resting and sleeping. The male mantled howler has an enlarged hyoid bone, a hollow bone near the vocal cords, which amplifies the calls made by the male, and is the reason for the name \\"howler\\". Howling allows the monkeys to locate each other without expending energy on moving or risking physical confrontation. The mantled howler lives in groups that can have over 40 members, although groups are usually smaller. Most mantled howlers of both sexes are evicted from the group they were born in upon reaching sexual maturity, resulting in most adult group members being unrelated. The most dominant male, the alpha male, gets preference for food and resting places, and mates with most of the receptive females. The mantled howler is important to the rainforest ecology as a seed disperser and germinator. Although it is affected by deforestation, it is able to adapt better than other species, due to its ability to feed on abundant leaves and its ability to live in a limited amount of space. == Taxonomy == The mantled howler belongs to the New World monkey family Atelidae, the family that contains the howler monkeys, spider monkeys, woolly monkeys and muriquis. It is a member of the subfamily Alouattinae and genus Alouatta, the subfamily and genus containing all the howler monkeys. The species name is A. palliata; a pallium was a cloak or mantle worn by ancient Greeks and Romans. This refers to the long guard hairs, known as a \\"mantle\\", on its sides. Three subspecies are recognized: * Ecuadorian mantled howler, Alouatta palliata aequatorialis, in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama and Peru; * Golden-mantled howler, Alouatta palliata palliata, in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua; * Mexican howler, Alouatta palliata mexicana, in Mexico and Guatemala. Two additional subspecies of the mantled howler are sometimes recognised, but these are more generally recognised as subspecies of the Coiba Island howler, Allouatta coibensis. However, mitochondrial DNA testing of their status has been inconclusive: * Azuero howler, Alouatta palliata trabeata, in Panama; * Alouatta palliata coibensis, in Panama. == Physical description == A Mantled Howler Monkey (Alouatta palliata) calling, in Tortuguero, Costa Rica Mantled howlers resting The mantled howler's appearance is similar to other howler monkeys of the genus Alouatta except for coloration. The mantled howler is primarily black except for a fringe of yellow or golden brown guard hairs on the flanks of the body earning the common name \\"mantled\\" howler monkey. When the males reach maturity, the scrotum turns white. Females are between in body length, excluding tail, and males are between . The prehensile tail is between long. Adult females generally weigh between , while males typically weigh between . Average body weights can vary significantly between monkey populations in different locations. The brain of an adult mantled howler is about , which is smaller than that of several smaller monkey species, such as the white-headed capuchin. The mantled howler shares several adaptations with other species of howler monkey that allow it to pursue a folivorous diet, that is, a diet with a large component of leaves. Its molars have high shearing crests, to help it eat the leaves, and males have an enlarged hyoid bone near the vocal cords. This hyoid bone amplifies the male mantled howler's calls, allowing it to locate other males without expending much energy. == Behavior == === Social structure === The mantled howler lives in groups. Group size usually ranges from 10 to 20 members, generally 1 to 3 adult males and 5 to 10 adult females, but some groups have over 40 members. Males outrank females, and younger animals of each gender generally have a higher rank than older animals. Higher-ranking animals get preference for food and resting sites, and the alpha male gets primary mating rights. Animals in the group are generally not related to each other because most members of both sexes leave the group before sexual maturity. Grooming activity in the mantled howler is infrequent and has been shown to reflect social hierarchy, with dominant individuals grooming subordinates. Most grooming activities are short and are typically females grooming infants or adult males. Aggressive interactions between group members is not often observed either. However, studies have shown that aggressive interactions among group members do occur, and are probably not often observed because these interactions tend to be quick and silent. Mantled howler groups that have been studied have occupied home ranges of between . Groups do not defend exclusive territories, but rather several groups have overlapping home ranges. However, if two groups meet each group will aggressively attempt to evict the other. On average, groups travel up to about each day. The mantled howler has little interaction with other sympatric monkey species but interactions with the white-headed capuchin sometimes occur. These are most often aggressive, and the smaller capuchins are more often the aggressors. However, affiliative associations between the capuchins and howlers do sometimes occur, mostly involving juveniles playing together, and at times the capuchins and howlers may feed in the same tree, apparently ignoring each other. === Diet === The mantled howler is the most folivorous species of Central American monkey. Leaves make up between almost 50% and 75% of the mantled howler's diet. The mantled howler is selective about the trees it eats from, and it prefers young leaves to mature leaves. This selectivity is likely to reduce the levels of toxins ingested, since certain leaves of various species contain toxins. Young leaves generally have less toxins as well as more nutrients than more mature leaves, and are also usually easier to digest. Mantled howler monkeys possess large salivary glands that help break down the leaf tannins by binding the polymers before the food bolus reaches the gut. Although leaves are abundant, they are a low energy food source. The fact that the mantled howler relies so heavily on a low energy food source drives much of its behaviour – for example, howling to locate other groups and spending a large portion of the day resting. Although leaves tend to make up the majority of the mantled howler's diet, fruit can also make up a large portion of the diet. When available, the proportion of fruit in the diet can be as much as 50%, and can sometimes exceed the proportion of leaves. The leaves and fruit from Ficus trees tend to be the preferred source of the mantled howler. Flowers can also make up a significant portion of the diet and are eaten in particularly significant quantities during the dry season. The mantled howler tends to get the water it needs from its food, drinking from tree holes during the wet season, and by drinking water trapped in bromeliads. Like other species of howler monkeys, almost all mantled howlers have full three color vision. This is different from other types of New World monkeys, in which most individuals have two color vision. The three color vision exhibited by the mantled howler is believed to be related to its dietary preferences, allowing it to distinguish young leaves, which tend to be more reddish, from more mature leaves. === Locomotion === Mature male showing prehensile tail and white scrotum The mantled howler is diurnal and arboreal. Movement within the rainforest canopy and floor includes quadrupedalism (walking and running on supports), bridging (crossing gaps by stretching), and climbing. It will also sometimes leap to get to another limb. However, the mantled howler is a relatively inactive monkey. It sleeps or rests the entire night and about three quarters of the day. Most of the active period is spent feeding, with only about 4% of the day spent on social interaction. This lethargy is an adaptation to its low energy diet. It uses its prehensile tail to grasp a branch when sleeping, resting or when feeding. It can support its entire body weight with the tail, but more often holds on by the tail and both feet. A study has shown that the mantled howler reuses travel routes to known feeding and resting sites, and appears to remember and use particular landmarks to help pick direct routes to its destination. === Communication === The mantled howler gets the name \\"howler\\" from the calls made by the males, particularly at dawn and dusk, but also in response to disturbances. These calls are very loud and can be heard from several kilometers. The calls consist of grunts and repeated roars that can last for four to five seconds each. The volume is produced by the hyoid bone — a hollow bone near the vocal cords — amplifying the sound made by the vocal cords. Male mantled howlers have hyoid bones that are 25 times larger than similarly sized spider monkeys, and this allows the bone to act like the body of a drum in amplifying the calls. Females also call but their calls are higher in pitch and not as loud as the males'. The ability to produce these loud roars is likely an energy saving device, consistent with the mantled howler's low energy diet. The roars allow the monkey to locate each other without moving around or risking physical confrontations. The mantled howler uses a wide range of other sounds, including barks, grunts, woofs, cackles and screeches. It uses clucking sounds to maintain auditory contact with other members of its group. Male mantled howler howling in the trees The mantled howler also uses non-vocal communication, such as \\"urine rubbing\\" when in a distressful social situation. This consists of rubbing the hands, feet, tail and/or chest with urine. It marks its scent by rubbing its throat on branches. Lip smacking and tongue movements are signals used by females to indicate an invitation to mate. Genital displays are used to indicate emotional states, and group members shake branches, which is apparently a playful activity. The mantled howler is usually indifferent to the presence of humans. However, when it is disturbed by people, it often express its irritation by urinating or defecating on them. It can accurately hit its observers despite being high in the trees. === Tool use === The mantled howler has not been observed using tools, and prior to 1997 no howler monkey was known to use tools. However, in 1997 a Venezuelan red howler (Alouatta seniculus) was reported to use a stick as a club to hit a Linnaeus's two-toed sloth, (Choloepus didactylus), that was resting in its tree. This suggests that other howlers, such as the mantled howler, may also use tools in ways that have not yet been observed. == Reproduction == Juvenile in a Costa Rican Pacific dry forest The mantled howler uses a polygamous mating system in which one male mates with multiple females. Usually, the alpha male monopolises the breeding opportunities, but if the alpha male is distracted, a lower-ranking male can get an opportunity to mate. And in some groups, lower-ranking males do get regular mating opportunities and do sire offspring. Alpha males generally maintain their status for about 2½ to 3 years, during which time they may father 18 or so infants. Females become sexually mature at 36 months, males at 42 months. Females reaching sexual maturity are typically 42 months old by their first birth. They undergo a regular estrus cycle, with an average duration of 16.3 days, and display sexual skin changes, particularly swelling and color change (from white to light pink) of the labia minora. The copulatory sequence begins when a receptive female approaches a male and engages in rhythmic tongue flicking. The male responds with the same tongue movements before the female turns while elevating her rump, which allows for mating to begin. Females apparently also use chemical signals, since males smell the females' genitals and taste their urine. The gestational period is 186 days; births can occur at any time of year. The infant's fur is silver at birth, but turns pale or gold after a few days. After that, the fur starts to darken, and the infant takes on the adult coloration at about 3 months old. The infant is carried under its mother, clinging to its mother's chest, for the first 2 or 3 weeks of its life. After that, it is carried on its mother's back. At about 3 months the mother will usually start to push the infant off, but will still carry the infant some of the time until it is 4 or 5 months old. After the young can move on its own, the mother will carry it across difficult gaps in the trees. Juveniles play among themselves much of the time. Infants are weaned at 1½ years old at which point maternal care ends. Adult females typically give birth every 19 to 23 months, assuming the prior infant survived to weaning. The mantled howler differs from other howler monkey species in that the males' testes do not descend until they reach sexual maturity. Upon reaching sexual maturity, the young monkeys are usually evicted from their natal group, although the offspring of a high-ranking female may get to stay in its natal group. However, many infants do not reach sexual maturity; high-ranking adults sometimes harass or kill the offspring of lower-ranking monkeys to eliminate competition to their own offspring for an opportunity to remain with the group upon reaching maturity. Natal emigration is performed by both sexes, with 79% of all males and 96% of the females leaving their original social group. When a male from outside the group ousts the previous alpha male, he normally kills any infants so that the mothers come into estrus quickly and are able to mate with him. Predators, such as cats, weasels, snakes and eagles, also kill infants. As a result, only about 30% of mantled howler infants live more than one year. The highest reproductive success occurs in the middle-ranking females, with the alpha position lower possibly because of competitive pressures, and infant mortality appears to be lower when the timing of births in a group of females is clustered. If it survives infancy, the mantled howler's lifespan is typically 25 years. == Distribution and habitat == Mantled howler in a wildlife sanctuary, Gulf of Dulce, Costa Rica The mantled howler is native to Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama and Peru. Within Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, the mantled howler is found in locations throughout the countries. In Colombia and Ecuador, it is found in a narrow corridor bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Andes Mountains to the east and also in Colombia in a small area near the Caribbean Sea close to the Panama border. In Guatemala, the mantled howler is found through the central part of the country, and into southeastern Mexico south of the Yucatán Peninsula. The mantled howler is among the most commonly seen and heard primates in many Central American national parks, including Manuel Antonio, Corcovado, Monteverde and Soberania. The mantled howler lives in several different types of forest, including secondary forest and semi-deciduous forest but is found in higher densities in older areas of forest and in areas containing evergreen forest. The mantled howler is sympatric with another howler monkey species, the Guatemalan black howler, A. pigra, over a small part of its range, in Guatemala and Mexico near the Yucatan Peninsula. == Conservation status == The mantled howler is regarded as vulnerable from a conservation standpoint by the IUCN. Its numbers may be adversely affected by rainforest fragmentation which has caused forced relocation of groups to less habitable regions. In 2011, the primatologist Joaquim Veà Baró studied in Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve in Veracruz, Mexico, the impact due to the fragmentation of populations and identified an increase in stress, especially among females, when a male from outside the group approached the area, because they felt that their offspring are being threatened. In addition, food limitation in areas of reduced surface area was forcing individuals to adapt their diet to increased food deprivation. Veà highlighted that “although this situation revealed up to what point individuals have the capacity for adaption, in some cases, undernourishment can lead to health problems that would make the population inviable”. Results can be compared to humans who “do not always eat everything which they should, for example in underdeveloped countries that have problems with malnutrition, rickets, a range of illnesses, but this does not put an end to the population, but rather provokes them to change their characteristics”. However, the mantled howler can adapt to forest fragmentation better than other species due to its low energy lifestyle, small home ranges and ability to exploit widely available food sources. The mantled howler is important to its ecosystems for a number of reasons, but especially in its capacity as a seed disperser and germinator, since passing through the monkey's digestive tract appears to aid the germination of certain seeds. Dung beetles, which are also seed dispersers as well as nutrient recyclers, also appear to be dependent on the presence of the mantled howler. The mantled howler is protected from international trade under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). == References == == External links == * ARKive—images and movies of the mantled howler monkey (Alouatta palliata) *Animal Diversity Web *Infonatura Category:Howler monkeys Howler, Mantled Howler, Mantled Howler, Mantled Howler, Mantled Howler, Mantled Category:Least concern biota of North America Category:Mammals described in 1849 ","title":"Mantled howler"},{"id":"3242784","text":"Greater Hungary can refer to: *Kingdom of Hungary before 1920, informally also known as \\"Greater Hungary\\" or \\"Historic Hungary\\" *Greater Hungary (irredentism), the full or partial territorial restoration of the Kingdom of Hungary, an official political goal of the Hungarian state between the two World Wars; the restoration of the unity of the territories of Kingdom of Hungary, the political goal of small marginalized groups today *Hungary during the Second World War, with some of the pre-1920 territories regained ","title":"Greater Hungary"},{"id":"3242790","text":"In mathematics, the Stieltjes moment problem, named after Thomas Joannes Stieltjes, seeks necessary and sufficient conditions for a sequence { mn, : n = 0, 1, 2, ... } to be of the form :m_n=\\\\int_0^\\\\infty x^n\\\\,d\\\\mu(x) for some measure μ.

It is found in Belize, Guatemala and Mexico, in and near the Yucatan Peninsula. It lives in evergreen, semideciduous and lowland rain forests. It is also known as the baboon in Belize, although it is not closely related to the baboons in Africa. ==Description== Male Guatemalan black howler. The Guatemalan black howler is the largest of the howler monkey species and one of the largest of the New World monkeys. Guatemalan black howler males are larger than those of any other Central American monkey species. On average, males weigh and females weigh . The body is between in length, excluding the tail. The tail is between long. Adults of both sexes have long, black hair and a prehensile tail, while infants have brown fur. Males over four months old have white scrotums. The Guatemalan black howler shares several adaptations with other species of howler monkey that allow it to pursue a folivorous diet (mostly leaves). Its molars have high shearing crests, to help it eat the leaves, and the male of the species has an enlarged hyoid bone near the vocal cords. This hyoid bone amplifies the male howler's calls, allowing it to locate other males without expending much energy, which is important, since leaves are a low-energy food. Howling occurs primarily at dawn and at dusk. The Guatemalan black howler is diurnal and arboreal. It lives in groups of generally one or two adult males, with a ratio of about 1.3 females for every male. Groups generally have between two and 10 members, including juveniles, but groups as large as 16 members have been studied. The home range is between 3 and 25 hectares. Population density can exceed 250 monkeys per square kilometer in the Community Baboon Sanctuary in Belize. The Guatemalan black howler's diet includes mostly leaves and fruit. Flowers also make up a small part of the diet. The breadnut tree can provide as much as 86% of the monkey's diet during some seasons. As with other howler monkey species, the majority of the Guatemalan black howler's day is spent resting. Eating makes up about a quarter of the day, moving about 10% of the day, and the remainder of the day is spent in socializing and other activities. Females reach sexual maturity at four, and males reach sexual maturity between six and eight years old. Males leave their natal group upon reaching sexual maturity, but females generally remain with their natal group. They can live up to 20 years. ===Conservation status=== The species is considered to be endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature because the species population is expected to decline by up to 60% over the next 30 years. Threats to the species include habitat loss, hunting, and capture as pets. The Guatemalan black howler belongs to the New World monkey family Atelidae, which contains howler monkeys, spider monkeys, woolly monkeys and muriquis. It is a member of the howler monkey genus Alouatta. No subspecies are recognized. ==Sympatry== The Guatemalan black howler is sympatric with the mantled howler along the edges of its range in Mexico and Guatemala near the Yucatan Peninsula. One theory for how this sympatry occurred and why the Guatemalan black howler has such a restricted range is the ancestors of the Guatemalan black howler and the Central American squirrel monkey migrated to Central America from South America during the late Miocene or Pliocene. However, passage through the Isthmus of Panama then closed for a period due to rising sea levels, and later opened up to another wave of migration about two million years ago. These later migrants, ancestors to modern populations of white-headed capuchins, mantled howlers and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, out-competed the earlier migrants, leading to the restricted range of the Guatemalan black howler (and the Central American squirrel monkey). == References == == External links == * ARKive - images and movies of the Guatemalan black howler (Alouatta pigra) * Infonatura * Sound recordings of Guatemalan black howlers at BioAcoustica Guatemalan Black Category:Primates of Central America Category:Mammals of Mexico Category:Fauna of Southern Mexico Category:Natural history of the Yucatán Peninsula Category:Endangered biota of Mexico Guatemalan Black Guatemalan Black ","title":"Guatemalan black howler"},{"id":"3242796","text":"Fawaz Mohammed Damrah (, Fawwāz Damra) was the imam of the Islamic Center of Parma, the largest mosque in the Cleveland area and taught at Cleveland State University and the local community college.

During the 1990s he was praised for outreach efforts in Jewish and Christian communities. He continued these interfaith efforts after the September 11 attacks. In late September 2001, after the attacks, a Cleveland TV station showed a video of a speech Damra had made in 1991 where he recommended stabbing Jews in Israel. Before the video aired he was well-regarded as a moderate Muslim. Damra has said that at the time of the speech Palestinian Islamic Jihad was not a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and explained that his rhetoric was influenced by his experiences growing up in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He apologized publicly for the remarks. He said that his outreach efforts with Jewish and Christian communities over the years had helped shape his views about peace and tolerance, saying \\"As all of us go through evolution in our life, intellectual and spiritual, so did I\\". ==Denaturalization== He was indicted in 2004, and prosecutors argued that Damra had lied on his U.S. citizenship application. They accused him of fundraising to support international terrorism and affiliation with groups that persecuted Jews. Damra told PBS that he \\"never raised money to any organization that is listed in the United States as organizations that support terrorism\\". He was convicted of concealing ties to three groups; Afghan Refugee Services; the Islamic Committee for Palestine; and Palestinian Islamic Jihad; and his American citizenship was revoked by United States District Judge James S.

Moreover, for the state of the applications to be restored as well (which is needed to restore the content of windows), the applications must be able to save their state of execution upon request from the session manager and load it back when started again. In general, a session can be saved or loaded at any time, even if the user is not logging in or out. It is also possible to save a number of different sessions and loading one of them at user's choice. Sessions can also be specified by providing the list of applications that compose the session. As a result, the user has the possibility of saving a set of different sessions, either by storing the state of execution of the currently running applications or by explicitly listing the applications that compose a session. This way, the user can later decide to load a given session. In order for a session to include the state of an application, the application must be able to store and load its current state when appropriate. A protocol named X Session Management Protocol (XSMP) specifies how applications and session managers interact. Of particular importance is that the window manager is able to communicate with the session manager, as the window manager is responsible for the placement of windows and the existence of icons. Applications that cannot store their state can be included in a session, but they do not preserve their state across sessions. The X Window System includes a default session manager called \`xsm\`. Other session managers have been developed for specific desktop systems: for example, \`ksmserver\` is the default session manager of KDE. == The Protocol == The XSMP is a subprotocol of the Inter-Client Exchange Protocol. The client starts the protocol by connecting to the session manager. How the session manager is located on the network is system-dependent: in a POSIX system, the environment contains a variable \`SESSION_MANAGER\`. Therefore, when a client is launched, its environment must contain this variable with an appropriate value. === Identifiers === The protocol takes into account two facts: # in order for a session to be restarted properly, not only the applications running in it must be restarted, but they must also be restarted in such a way they restore their previous state; # the same application may be running more than once in the same or different session. xedit open on different files Different instances of the same application may be active at the same time in the same or in different sessions, and these instances most likely have different states of execution. For example, the user may have launched a text editor on file \`/etc/passwd\`, then on file \`letter.txt\` in the same session, and then on file \`todo.txt\` in another session. In order for the sessions to be restored properly, different instances of the same application must be recognized as different by the session manager. For this reason, the session manager chooses a unique identifier for each instance of each application. This way, the session manager is able to distinguish between the text editor that is running on \`/etc/passwd\` and the text editor running on \`todo.txt\`, even if they are two instances of the same program. The identifiers must be unique. In particular, they must be unique across all sessions managed by the session manager: the identifier of the text editor running on \`/etc/passwd\` is different not only from the same text editor running on \`letter.txt\` but also different from the text editor running on \`todo.txt\` in another session. The identifier of a client remains the same even if the session is shut down and restarted. === The main parts of the protocol === The main parts of the protocol of session management are: # the session manager chooses a unique identifier for every client # the session manager requests clients to save their state # a client specifies how it has to be started again in order for the state to be restored (e.g., the command line to be used to start the process) The last point is possible because the session manager maintains a set of properties for every client (in the X Window System terminology, a property is simply a container for data). These pieces of information can be modified by the client at any time. One of these properties is named \`RestartCommand\`, and contains the information on how the client has to be started again. When the session manager requests a client to save its state, the application proceeds as follows: # it saves its state in such a way that the states of two different instances can be distinguished; this can be obtained for example by saving the state in a file whose name contains its identifier # it stores the specification of how it has to be started again in the \`RestartCommand\` property; this property must contain the client identifier because: ## the application must retain its identifier when started again ## the identifier is needed to restore the state (for example, it is needed to find the file where its state is stored) The session manager maintains other properties beside \`RestartCommand\`. For example, a property specifies how to run the application if the session is destroyed. === Local and global state === When asking a client to save its state, the window manager can specify whether the local or global state (or both) has to be saved. The difference is whether the result of the save should be visible to the other applications or not. In the case of the text editor, saving the global state means saving the file normally, so that other applications can use the new version of the file. Saving the local state means that a local copy of the file has to be saved, so that other applications can see the file in its original version. === An example === The following are the main steps in the interaction of a session manager with the hypothetical text editor \`xyz\` when this application is started for the first time in a session, then the user logs out and then in again: # the application connects to the session manager via the Inter-Client Exchange Protocol # the application tells the session manager that this is the first time it is started, and therefore it has no previous identifier (and, therefore, no previous state) # the session manager replies by sending the client its unique identifier, say \`4324\`; # the session manager immediately asks the client to save its local state (only because the client has been started for the first time) # the client stores the command line \`xyz -sid 4324\` as the property \`RestartCommand\` in the session manager (this is also system-dependent: in a POSIX system, this property actually contains the argv array) # the client stores its state locally; for example, it may store the name of the edited file and all other information (such as the current line) in the local file \`.temp-4324\` # when the user logs out, the session manager sends a message to all client notifying that they have to save their state # the client \`4324\` complies again # when all clients have communicated the session manager that their state is saved, the session manager shuts down the session When the client is told to save its state, it may have the possibility of having a limited interaction with the user or not (for example, to ask the user if the edited file is to be saved). Anyway, the state is saved, it tells the session manager by sending an appropriate message). When the session is started again, the following takes place: # the session manager restarts the client \`4324\` by executing what is stored in the property \`RestartCommand\` associated with the client \`4324\` # the application is therefore started as \`xyz -sid 4324\`; this way, the application knows its identifier # the application retrieves the state information from the file \`.temp-4324\` # the application connects to the session manager specifying the identifier \`4324\`, so that the session manager knows that this is not a new client but an old one restarting == Client- managing sessions == According to the XSMP protocol, a session manager is an arbitrary program that runs and controls the state of other applications. As a result, a client can itself be a session manager of other clients. For example, a mail client can start a text editor for the sake of writing an email, and behave as a session manager with respect to the editor. This way, if the mail client is closed and then restarted again, it can restore the state of the text editor. ==History== For GNOME the GNOME session manager superseded XSMP with a D-Bus interface in version 2.24. It is nowhere near feature complete however, nor used by non GNOME applications. == See also == * X Window System protocols and architecture * X window manager ==References== == External links == * The X Session Management Protocol * xsm manual page * ksmserver, the KDE session manager * ROX-Session, the ROX Desktop session manager Category:X Window System ","title":"X session manager"},{"id":"3242821","text":"The yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Oreonax flavicauda) is a New World monkey endemic to Peru. It is a rare primate species found only in the Peruvian Andes, in the departments of Amazonas and San Martin, as well as bordering areas of La Libertad, Huánuco, and Loreto. The yellow-tailed woolly monkey was at first classified in the genus Lagothrix along with other woolly monkeys, but due to debatable primary sources, they have been placed in Oreonax. Oreonax has been proposed to be a subgenus of Lagothrix, but others have regarded it as a full genus. A recent extensive study suggests that the yellow-tailed woolly monkey may indeed be in Lagothrix. ==Discovery and rediscovery== The species was first described by Alexander von Humboldt in 1812 under the name Simia flavicauda, based on a skin found 10 years earlier, used by a local man as a horse saddle. Humboldt had never seen a live animal of this species nor a preserved specimen, and believed it belonged to the genus Alouatta. For over 100 years, the species was reported on only a few isolated occasions, so was thought to be extinct. In 1926, three specimens were collected in San Martin, which were then brought to the Museum of Natural History. They were believed to be of a new species, but further evidence made it clear that these specimens were of the yellow-tailed woolly monkey. In 1974, a group of scientists, led by Russell Mittermeier, and funded by World Wide Fund for Nature, found a young yellow-tailed woolly monkey which was kept as a pet in the city of Pedro Ruiz Gallo, Amazonas.Mittermeier, R.A., Macedo- Ruiz, H. de, Luscombe, B.A.y Cassidy, J. (1977) Rediscovery and conservation of the Peruvian yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Lagothrix flavicauda). The rediscovery attracted the attention of national and international press, as well as conservation organizations that saw the need to know quickly the status of this species. In the summer of 2004, scientists searched for yellow- tailed woolly monkeys in a remote area of San Martin, where the forest is tropical, humid, and quite mountainous. The forest area, threatened due to haphazard tree cutting, was believed to have at least a minor population of the species, and was studied along with two other areas of Peru. The loss of habitat due to the tree cutting in the yellow-tailed woolly monkey habitat could prove problematic for the species as a whole. The introduction of farm plots in regions where this organism can be sustained is impacting the yellow-tailed woolly. The farmers of Peru are afraid of losing their farmland to conservation efforts. Farmers said that they did not hunt the monkeys, but that the land is necessary for growing coffee and raising cattle. The balance between avoiding the extinction of the species and maintaining the livelihood of the farmers of Peru is a major issue in the struggle for conservation efforts toward the yellow-tailed woolly monkey. ==Description== Oreonax flavicauda is one of the rarest Neotropical primates and is one of Peru's largest endemic mammals. Adult head and body lengths can range from 51.3 to 53.5 cm, with tails even longer than the body, up to 63 cm (25 in). The average weight is 8 kg in adults, but some males reach 11.5 kg. Peruvian yellow-tailed woolly monkeys are similar in size to the common woolly monkey, also in the genus Lagothrix. They live in large social groups (around 23 individuals) of both male and females. They have low reproductive rates and long interbirth intervals, which adds to their vulnerability for extinction. They are known to express aggressive behaviors upon initial encounters such as branch shaking, \\"mooning\\" of the scrotal tuft, and short barking calls. The yellow-tailed woolly monkeys' fur is longer and denser than other woolly monkeys, an adaptation to its cold montane forest habitat. The monkey's color is deep mahogany and copper with a whitish patch on its snout extending from the chin to between its eyes. Its fur gets darker towards its upper body, making its head seem almost black. It has a powerful prehensile tail, with a hairless patch on its underside and a yellowish pelage on the last third of the tail, giving this species its name. This coloration of the tail is not seen in infants and juveniles. The powerful tail is capable of supporting the animal's entire body weight while feeding or just hanging around; it also uses its tail to help travel through the canopy. The monkey is also known for its long, yellowish, pubic hair tuft. It has the ability to leap 15 m (49 ft). ==Habitat and distribution== The yellow-tailed woolly monkey is one of the least known of the primate species. It is also one of the largest neotropical primates. They are regularly found in the tropical Andes. Their habitat is characterized as rough terrain consisting of steep mountain sides and deep river gorges, with canopy heights of 20–25 m. Cloud forest, the habitat of this monkey, are in high altitudes and often have cloud coverage near or in them. The last estimated population count was less than 250 individuals. The current habitat of the yellow-tailed monkey is fragmented due to deforestation, as is the population. This can hinder reproduction, as it limits an already limited population. The Yellow-Tailed monkey has never been subject to a full census so exact numbers vary. A study was done to exam the population however the terrain and fragmented populations made this difficult. The yellow-tailed woolly monkey lives in the montane cloud forests of the Peruvian Andes at elevations of above sea level in the departments of Amazonas and San Martin, as well as bordering areas of La Libertad, Huánuco, and Loreto. Its habitat is characterized by steep gorges and ravines. The original extent of its habitat is estimated to be around , but recent estimates put the remaining habitat at between . ==Diet and natural history== Its diet is primarily frugivorous, but leaves, flowers, insects and other invertebrates are also eaten. The species is arboreal and diurnal. It has a multiple-male group social system and a polygamous mating system. They have a variety of vocalisations, including a loud, \\"puppy-like\\" bark which they use as a territorial or alarm call. Yellow-tailed woolly monkeys participate in geophagy, the consumption of soil. Geophagy is a rare biological behavior, but the species benefits since it results in trace mineral intake of minerals and reduction of intestinal parasites; they tend to suffer from an iron-deficient diet. Their consumption of soil allows them to intake iron that they do not get from their regular diet. ==Conservation== The inaccessibility of its habitat protected the species until the 1950s. However, the construction of new roads, habitat loss and fragmentation from agriculture, logging and cattle ranching, and subsistence hunting, together with the monkey's naturally low population densities, slow maturation, and low reproductive rate, have led to a predicted decline of at least 80% over the next three generations. This and its restricted geographic distribution have led to this species' current critically endangered status. Conservation work started soon after the species was rediscovered in the mid-1970s. This pioneering work by the Peruvian NGO APECO led to the creation of three protected areas, Rio Abiseo National Park, Alto Mayo Protected Forest, and Cordillera de Colán National Sanctuary. From the mid-1980s until recently, further conservation or research efforts were minimal. Starting in 2007, though, British NGO Neotropical Primate Conservation has been running conservation initiatives for the species throughout its range. The species is considered one of \\"The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates\\". Habitat loss by deforestation is the biggest threat to the endangerment of yellow-tailed woolly monkeys. The Lima-Tarapoto highway which runs through the regions of San Martin and Amazonas has caused the immigration of people from coastal and high mountain regions leading to overpopulation. Due to the negligence of the regional government of Shipasbamba, Amazonas to the accept requests for conservation efforts, local lands have been the victims of slash-and-burn agriculture by local farmers to support the growing demand of local agricultural crops, as well as to support the increase in population size. With the deforestation and increased population, the monkeys have had their habitat range reduced, which increases their risk of extinction. Conservation efforts led by ASPROCOT have been made recently to help protect the endangered monkeys by turning to alternative forms of agriculture to preserve the remnants of the Amazonas forests. However, a lack of funding has slowed the conservation process. Several communities in Peru have made conservation efforts to preserve the yellow- tailed woolly monkeys through various ways. Community-based conservation efforts have been made in preserving the monkeys, such as in Los Chilchos valley, where the project is directed by the Apenheul Primate Conservation Trust. Efforts include preventing further immigration into areas home to the monkeys and beginning ecosystem protection initiatives. Neotropical Primate Conservation has begun using newly constructed roads in La Esperanza to access areas which are now being used to develop ecotourism initiatives to build awareness about the endangered monkey population and its habitat, which has helped local people understand the importance in preserving the monkeys and that the monkeys can be used as a valuable tourist attraction. ==References== ==External links== * Infonatura * Animalinfo * Primate Info Net Oreonax Factsheets * Pictures of Oreonax Flavicauda. yellow-tailed woolly monkey Category:EDGE species Category:Mammals of Peru Category:Endemic fauna of Peru Category:Mammals of the Andes yellow-tailed woolly monkey ","title":"Yellow-tailed woolly monkey"},{"id":"3242822","text":"Shanna Compton is the author of Down Spooky, a collection of poems published by Winnow Press in October 2005, and the editor of GAMERS: Writers, Artists & Programmers on the Pleasures of Pixels, an anthology of essays on the theme of video games, published by Soft Skull Press in 2004.

This miniseries is notable for being one of the very few adaptations of Swift's novel to feature all four voyages. The miniseries aired in the United Kingdom on Channel 4, and in the United States on NBC in February 1996. The miniseries stars Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen, Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud, Omar Sharif, Isabelle Huppert, Geraldine Chaplin, Shashi Kapoor, Warwick Davis, Kristin Scott Thomas, Alfre Woodard, Kate Maberly, Tom Sturridge, Richard Wilson and Nicholas Lyndhurst. The series won five Emmy Awards including in the Outstanding Miniseries category. ==Premise== In this version, Dr. Gulliver has returned to his family after a long absence. The action shifts back and forth between flashbacks of his travels and the present where he is telling the story of his travels and has been committed to an insane asylum (the flashback framework and the incarceration in the asylum are not in the novel). While the miniseries remains faithful to the novel, the ending has been changed to have a more upbeat conclusion. In the book, Gulliver is so impressed with the Utopian country of the Houyhnhnms that when he returns to England he eventually chooses to live out his life among the horses in his barn, rather than with his family. In the miniseries, he recovers from this obsession and returns to his wife and child. ==Production== It took years to find the financial backing for the miniseries. The project required a good deal of special effects work. Producer Duncan Kenworthy said that, \\"It [Gulliver's Travels] was something I'd been developing while Jim was still alive. ... We wanted to do the whole book, and that was what interested Jim.\\" Jim Henson's Creature Shop created several CGI wasps and some prosthetic make-up for the Yahoos. The animals seen in this film were provided by A1 Animals. It was shot in England and Portugal. ==Plot== ===Part 1=== Long missing and believed dead, Lemuel Gulliver (Ted Danson) is found in the stables of his own home one morning by his wife Mary (Mary Steenburgen) and son Tom (Tom Sturridge). He narrates what is received as a tall tale that begins with being shipwrecked on an island of tiny people called Lilliput, shown as flashbacks, while Gulliver also hallucinates some of the persons and events he witnessed. Gulliver explains the strange customs of Lilliput, such as selecting government officials by jumping over and going under a stick held by the Emperor of Lilliput (Peter O'Toole). Gulliver is presented to the Empress of Lilliput (Phoebe Nicholls) and is asked to fight a war against the enemy country of Blefuscu. To show his gratitude, Gulliver accepts and wins the war by disabling the Belfuscu Navy. During celebrations, a fire begins at the palace in the Empress's chambers; Gulliver puts out the fire with his own urine, leaving the Empress humiliated and demanding his execution. The country's leading generals also want him killed, for refusing to further decimate Blefuscu. Fleeing from the Emperor's army, Gulliver's Lilliputian friends hide him and help build a raft to escape on. Meanwhile, Gulliver's wife Mary asks for the help of Dr. Bates (James Fox), who had taken over both Gulliver's position and house, allowing Mary and Tom to live there. Bates, who wishes to wed Mary, conspires to have Gulliver detained at a mental institution, suggesting Gulliver has dementia. Mary goes to visit Gulliver there; on one of these visits Tom enters Bates' home office and finds Gulliver's travel satchel, containing his journal and a Lilliputian sheep, corroborating his story. Bates attempts to burn the journal. Over time Bates exerts enough influence over Mary to stop her hospital visits; Tom, on the other hand, recovers the damaged journal and hides it in his room. At the mental institution, Gulliver continues to spin his tale. His Lilliputian raft crashes in Brobdingnag, a land populated by Giants. He is found by Farmer Grultrud (Ned Beatty) who exhibits him as a crop guardian. Gulliver is sold to a lady of the royal court, along with the farmer's daughter Glumdalclitch (Kate Maberly) as his caretaker, and presented to the Queen of Brobdingnag (Alfre Woodard). For being the smallest creature, Gulliver displaces court dwarf Grildrig (Warwick Davis), who comes to despise him and later attempts to kill him. Gulliver is examined by doctors who ridicule him for his size. To ingratiate himself, Gulliver discusses many aspects of English culture and politics with the Queen, which she ultimately finds repugnant in comparison to the fair-sharing system of Brobdingnag. While awaiting a feast, Grildrig sends some giant wasps to kill Gulliver, but Gulliver is swift enough to kill them. He then extracts a wasp's sting and makes a dagger from it. To restore his standing with the queen, Gulliver has arranged for a gunpowder demonstration, which the scientists increase tenfold without his knowledge; the resulting explosion puts him more out of favor. Meanwhile, Glumdalclitch has fallen in love with Gulliver and wishes to marry him. Gulliver softly rejects her advances and asks her to free him. Glum takes Gulliver to the beach to search for ships that might take him home, but are unsuccessful. An eagle makes off with Gulliver's travel box, dropping it at sea. With no supplies, Gulliver believes his life at an end when he sees a gigantic floating rock in the sky. ===Part 2=== Continuing his tale, Gulliver is rescued by the people of the flying land of Laputa. He befriends the Rajah (Shashi Kapoor) and his \\"idiot\\" son Prince Munodi (Navin Chowdhry). The prince shows Gulliver how the island is controlled, by a massive lodestone repelling them from the planet. Laputa is supplied by taking tribute from the lands they pass over; one of these lands is ruled by the prince's mother Empress Munodi (Geraldine Chaplin), who refuses to give tribute. The Rajah demands a bombing attack, to which the Empress responds with a giant lodestone of her own, causing Laputa great turbulence. The prince suggests reversing the lodestone to stop the interference. Gulliver makes this happen, but falls off the island into the Empress' palace for his troubles. Empress Munodi directs Gulliver to The Academy, a place suggested by the Rajah where he may find a path back to England, where he encounters many scientists lacking in common sense. Leaving that place, Gulliver encounters a magician (Omar Sharif) in Glubbdubdrib. He stays at the magician's palace with the promise of being taken to a port to go to England, but each day the magician puts him off, saying \\"tomorrow.\\" Gulliver later discovers the magician is drugging him and using his blood to summon the ghosts of great figures such as Alexander the Great (Ian Dunn) and Julius Caesar. Gulliver later summons more spirits by his own will, and uses this power to overwhelm the palace and gain freedom. Meanwhile, as Bates will not allow Mary to see Gulliver, telling both that the other refuses to see them, she writes letters to her husband, which Bates intercepts and stashes on his office bookshelves. Some time later, Tom reveals to Mary that Bates has been hiding the letters. She confronts Bates, intending to take her husband home. Gulliver tells his fellow inmates about meeting the immortal Struldbrugs, who imprison him for trespassing. He gives his wasp-sting dagger to the Gatekeeper (Kristin Scott Thomas) to enter, but rejects their offer to gain immortality by drinking their water – the price being blindness. Gulliver makes it to a port and joins a ship, but a mutiny en route leads to him swimming to another strange land. Gulliver encounters the mud-covered, savage Yahoos and the intelligent, graceful Houyhnhnm horses. He talks to the Houyhnhnm Mistress (voiced by Isabelle Huppert) and explains his costumes and lifestyle, and begins to admire more their culture. He studies the customs of Yahoos and Houyhnhnms and decides to prove to the Houyhnhnms that he's more like them. He even rejects the diamonds he finds in a quarry. After a savage encounter with a female Yahoo, the Houyhnhnms, even though they recognize his virtues, form a council and decide that Gulliver must leave. With sadness, Gulliver departs the island and is rescued by a Portuguese ship, against his will. Gulliver is subjected to a medical evaluation while he relates his Houyhnhnm experience. Mary, having witnessed the hearing, supports her husband against Bates' accusations and questions his motives for keeping Gulliver in the hospital. Gulliver's son enters the court room showing the small Lilliputian sheep Gulliver took care of. With this proof of his story, Gulliver is released. Bates goes abroad soon after and is not heard from again. Gulliver struggles against re-becoming like a Yahoo, and shares what he is now as a person. ==Cast and characters== ===Main=== * Ted Danson as Lemuel Gulliver * Mary Steenburgen as Mary Gulliver * Tom Sturridge as Tom Gulliver * James Fox as Dr. Bates * Peter O'Toole as Emperor of Lilliput * Omar Sharif as Sorcerer * Alfre Woodard as Queen of Brobdingnag * John Gielgud as Professor of Light ===Guest=== * Ned Beatty as Farmer Grultrud * Annette Badland as Farmer Grultrud's Wife * Kate Maberly as Glumdalclitch * Shashi Kapoor as Rajah of Laputa * Geraldine Chaplin as Empress Munodi * Navin Chowdhry as Prince Munodi * Edward Fox as General Limtoc * Warwick Davis as Grildrig * Edward Woodward as Drunlo * Nicholas Lyndhurst as Clustril * Phoebe Nicholls as Empress of Lilliput * Robert Hardy as Dr Parnell * Kristin Scott Thomas as Immortal Gatekeeper * Isabelle Huppert as Houyhnhnm Mistress (voice) * John Standing as Admiral Bolgolam * John Wells as Flimnap the Treasurer * Graham Crowden as Professor of Politics * Richard Wilson as Professor of Language * Edward Petherbridge as Dr. Pritchard * Karyn Parsons as Lady-In-Waiting * George Harris as Brobdingnag Scientist ==Reception== The miniseries was generally well received by critics.

It is unusual among primates in that it shows egaliterian social relationships. It is found in the Atlantic Forest region of the Brazilian states of Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais and Bahia. Muriquis are the largest species of New World monkeys. The northern muriqui can grow up to 4.3 ft long. It feeds mainly on leaves and twigs, but will also eat fruit. It often hangs upside-down by its prehensile tail while eating. ==Identification== Northern muriquis have natural pale facial marks.

The estimated wild population of northern muriquis was raised from about 500 to 1000 individuals in 2005, due to new discoveries and research in other forests. ==Human evolution relevance== The northern muriqui has been argued to be important to understanding human evolution, since it is one of the few primates that has tolerant, nonhierarchial relationships among and between males and females, a feature shared with hunter-gatherer humans, but which contrasts with the ranked relationships of most other primates.Strier, K.B., Chaves, P.B., Mendes, S.L., Fagundes, V., Di Fiore, A. (2011). Low paternity skew and the influence of maternal kin in an egalitarian, patrilocal primate, PNAS, 108, 18915–18919 Group aggression is also rare. The success of males fathering offspring links to the maternal investment they gain from their mothers and coresident female kin. This provides support to the grandmother hypothesis. ==See also== *Feliciano Miguel Abdala Private Natural Heritage Reserve, long thought to be the only place where these monkeys still survive ==References== ==Gallery== {  Silhouette of adult using its prehensile tail  Sitting muriqui  At Caratinga Biological Station } ==External links== *ARKive - images and movies of the Northern muriqui (Brachyteles hypoxanthus) *Infonatura northern muriqui Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Fauna of the Atlantic Forest (biome) Category:Primates of South America Category:Critically endangered animals Category:Critically endangered biota of South America northern muriqui ","title":"Northern muriqui"},{"id":"3242860","text":"Tomochichi and his nephew, Toonahawi Tomochichi (to-mo-chi-chi') (c. 1644 – October 5, 1739) was the head chief of a Yamacraw town on the site of present- day Savannah, Georgia in the 18th century. He gave his land to James Oglethorpe to build the city of Savannah. He remains a prominent character of early Georgia history. As the principal mediator between the native population and the new English settlers during the first years of settlement, he contributed much to the establishment of peaceful relations between the two groups and to the ultimate success of Georgia. == Life == Although much of his early life is unknown, Tomochichi was exiled from the Creek nation for unclear reasons and, along with several followers, first settled what is now Savannah, Georgia. Presumably, he was Creek and participated in their early activities with Englishmen in South Carolina, both peaceful and hostile. In about 1728 Tomochichi created his own tribe of Yamacraw from an assortment of Creek and Yamasee Indians after the two nations disagreed over future relations with the English and the Spanish. His group, approximately two hundred people, settled on the bluffs of the Savannah River because the location was the resting place of his ancestors and had close proximity to English traders. When General James Oglethorpe and his fellow settlers reached the region in February 1733, they realized the need to negotiate fairly with the neighboring Indian tribes or risk the success of their enterprise. Mary Musgrove, daughter of a Creek mother and an English father, and her husband, John, served as interpreters for the general and the chief. Tomochichi had had previous contact with English colonists, making him unafraid yet cautious. The aging warrior had several different options available, but he decided to receive the new arrivals and to give them permission to establish Savannah in order to take advantage of trading and diplomatic connections. By the time of the establishment of the colonial charter of Georgia in 1732 (the colonial charter was contributed in the same year), Tomochichi remaining a lifelong friend of the early English colonists, helping the settlers in Georgia negotiate a treaty with the Lower Creeks (as well as settling previous disagreements with the Creek). James Oglethorpe wrote the following account in a letter date June 9, 1733: > \\"There seems a Door opened to our Colony towards the Conversion of the > Indians. I have had many Conversations with their chief Men, the whole > Tenour of which shews there is nothing wanting to their Conversion, but one, > who understands their Language well, to explain to them the Mysteries of > Religion; for as to the moral Part of Christianity they understand it and > assent to it.

Dated the 9th of June Last [my note-June 1732]. James Oglethorpe presenting Tomochichi and other Yamacraw Indians to the Georgia Trustees, July 3, 1734, by William Verelst. From the Winterthur Museum and Country Estate Tomochichi wanted his people to be educated. He worked with Benjamin Ingham, a friend of John Wesley and Charles Wesley, to create an Indian school at Irene that opened in September 1736.Tomochichi at the New Georgia Encyclopedia During the first five years of English settlement, Tomochichi provided invaluable assistance to the new colony. One year after Oglethorpe's arrival, the Indian chief accompanied him back to England along with a small delegation of family and Lower Creek tribesmen. There, Tomochichi expertly fulfilled the position as mediator for his people during numerous meetings with important English dignitaries. He met King George II of Great Britain at Kensington Palace on August 1, 1734, and gave the King eagle feathers as a token of peace.Black, Jeremy (2007) George II: Puppet of the Politicians?, Exeter: University of Exeter Press, p. 32, Tomochichi's travel allowed him to be present for the ratification of the Articles of Friendship and Commerce, the treaty that both he and Oglethorpe established allowing Englishmen to settle in Yamacraw Bluff in what would be named Savannah. He politely followed English mannerisms in his public appearances while pushing for recognition and realization of the demands of his people for education and fair trade. Upon his return to Georgia, Tomochichi met with other Lower Creek chieftains to reassure them of the honest intentions of these new Englishmen and convinced them to ally with the English despite previous deceitful encounters with their northern neighbors in South Carolina. After Oglethorpe returned to Georgia in February 1736, the chief received John Wesley, minister of Savannah, his brother Charles, and their friend Benjamin Ingham. Tomochichi reiterated his requests for Christian education for his tribe, but John Wesley rebuffed him with complex replies. Ingham, on the other hand, assisted in creating an Indian school at Irene, which opened in September 1736 much to the delight of the elderly chieftain. The same year, Tomochichi and Oglethorpe participated in an expedition to determine the southern boundaries of Georgia and helped mediate interactions with the Spanish. Tomochichi exerted his best efforts to maintain peace, and Oglethorpe regularly asked his friend for advice and assistance in achieving this goal. In February 1739, the subject met with a diplomatic delegation of Choctaws who were meeting with English authorities in Savannah.\\"America and West Indies: February 1739, 16-28.\\" Calendar of State Papers Colonial, America and West Indies: Volume 45, 1739. Ed. K G Davies. London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1994. 37-50. British History Online. Retrieved 27 May 2019. During the summer of 1739 Oglethorpe made an unprecedented journey to Coweta, deep in Indian Territory, to bolster his connections to the Lower Creeks, which resulted in a mutually favorable treaty. Tomochichi was unable to partake directly in Oglethorpe's negotiations; instead, he lay at home in his village fighting a serious illness. ==Death and legacy== Tomochichi Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse (Chatham County, Georgia) Tomochichi died on October 5, 1739, and while sources differ over his exact age, historians and contemporary observers generally agree that he was 95 when he died. Before he died in 1739, he told the Creek Indians to remember how well the King treated them and he hoped that they would remain friends forever. He was given a public funeral by the colony. His contributions to the colony of Georgia were celebrated with an English military funeral, and the grave site was commemorated with a marker of \\"a Pyramid of Stone\\" collected from the vicinity. Senauki, his wife, and his nephew, Toonahowi, were left in charge of the tribe, but he appointed no one to take his place as the impartial mediator between the Indians and the English. The monument marking his gravesite was destroyed under unknown circumstances, the last known mention of the pyramid being in 1759. In the early 1870s, another monument was built on the site, this time an earthen mound with a decorative planter in the center, identical to at least four other mounds and planters built in other local squares. The planter is commonly mis-identified as the monument to Tomochichi, a mistake that arises from a 1937 Savannah Morning News article. The planter was later removed to make way for the William Washington Gordon Monument, honoring the founder of the Central of Georgia Railroad and the grandfather of Juliette Gordon Low, founder of the Girl Scouts.“Copy of Minutes of Meeting of the Board of Directors, Central Rail Road and Banking Company of Georgia. July 12, 1883,” vertical file “Monuments/Memorials – Savannah, Ga - Gordon Monument,” Georgia Historical Society, Savannah, Georgia. Upset with the lack of monument for Tomochichi, Gordon's daughter-in-law, Nellie Gordon, had a new monument to his memory, a large granite boulder with a decorative copper plate, installed southeast of the original structure on April 21, 1899, by the Georgia Society of The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America.Tomochichi's Monument at the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America The Georgia Historical Commission later placed a large marker in Savannah's Wright Square, which details the achievements of the Yamacraw chieftain. Savannah's Tomochichi Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse was named in his honor. ==Notes== == References == * Lafarge, Oliver. A Pictorial History of the American Indian.

Kibbutz Hanita, 1938 Sadeh visits the Police fortress at Iraq Suwaydan, November 8, 1948 Sadeh (left) and Yigal Allon, 1948 Yitzhak Sadeh (, born Izaak Landoberg, August 10, 1890 – August 20, 1952), was the commander of the Palmach and one of the founders of the Israel Defense Forces at the time of the establishment of the State of Israel. ==Biography== Sadeh was born as Izaak Landoberg to a Polish Jewish family in Lublin, in the Russian Partition of the Russian Empire (now in Poland). His mother, Rebecca, was the daughter of rabbi Shneur Zalman Fradkin. In his youth, he studied with rabbi Hillel Zeitlin. Sadeh was married three times. His third wife, Margot Meier-Sadeh, died of cancer a year before him. He had two daughters, Daphne and Rivka, and a son, Yoram. Sadeh died in Tel Aviv in August 1952. By then, he had become a charismatic and colorful figure, whose nickname in the Palmach was HaZaken (The Old Man). He is buried at Kibbutz Givat Brenner. ==Military career== When World War I broke out, he joined the Imperial Russian Army. He saw action and was decorated for bravery. In 1917, he met Joseph Trumpeldor, and between 1917 and 1919, assisted him in the founding of HeHalutz (The Pioneer) movement. In 1920, Sadeh made aliyah to Eretz Israel, where he became one of founders and leaders of Gdud HaAvoda (The Labor Battalion). In 1921, Sadeh was a Haganah (Defense) commander in Jerusalem. During the 1929 riots he took part in the battle defending Haifa. When the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine began, Sadeh established the Nodedet (Wandering Troop or Patrol Unit) in Jerusalem, that confronted the Arabs in their villages and bases. He demanded that his troops \\"leave the defences\\" and initiate military operations. In the summer of 1937, as commander of the Jewish Settlement Police, he founded the FOSH (Hebrew abbreviation, FO'SH, for Plugot Sadeh, lit. Field Companies), the commando arm of the Haganah. It was an elite Jewish strike force, whose members were hand- picked by Sadeh. Sadeh commanded the establishment of Kibbutz Hanita on an isolated hill on the southern border of Lebanon. In 1941, he was instrumental in the founding of the Palmach (acronym for Plugot Mahatz, lit. Striking Companies), the Haganah's enlisted military forces of volunteers). The purpose of this clandestine elite unit was to prepare to undertake a guerilla war in the event of the Axis forces entering Palestine. During the 200 days of dread, Sadeh worked on the Carmel Plan, which was a detailed strategy to withdraw the entire Jewish community in Palestine to Mount Carmel, forming a large enclave to withstand the invaders. He was Commander of the Palmach until 1945, when he was appointed as the Haganah's Chief of the General Staff and, among other activities, was in charge of the movement's operations against the British Forces during the British Mandate of Palestine and in operations that brought clandestine Jewish immigrants to Israel. He was also instrumental in founding the Gadna in 1941, and became the program's first unofficial commander. 8th Armoured Brigade captures Lydda airport (1948) ===War of Independence=== At the beginning of 1948, Yitzhak Sadeh was in commanded of Haganah training camp at Mishmar HaEmek. In early April he successfully defended the kibbutz against a full-scale attack by the Arab Liberation Army. In the counter-attack that followed his troops conquered a large section of the Jezreel Valley. At the end of April he commanded two Brigades in a series of attacks on strategic areas in and around Jerusalem, Operation Yevusi. During the truce in June he was responsible for the establishing the first armored brigade of the IDF. In July this Brigade played an important part in Operation Danny, capturing Lod airport, and in October, Operation Yoav, the taking of the Iraq Suwaydan fortress blocking the road to the Negev. In December 1948 he participated in Operation Horev in the Negev, when the forces under his command crossed the Egyptian border and threatened El-Arish as well as the Egyptian army in the Gaza Strip. ==Literary career== When the War of Independence ended and the Palmach was dismantled in 1949, Sadeh left military service. He wrote essays, stories and plays. The book Misaviv Lamedura (Around the Bonfire) includes a collection of articles he wrote under the pen name Y. Noded (Y. Wanderer). ==Sports activism== Sadeh was a promoter and educator in the field of Jewish sport. When in Russia, he participated in wrestling meets and became the wrestling champion of St. Petersburg. As an active sportsperson, he recognized physical education as having important cultural and educational values. As a member of the Hapoel (The Worker) board, he set policies and established guidelines and created the Hapoel motto, Alafim lo Alufim (Thousands not Champions). Today, thousands of sports people and soldiers take part in the Mount Tavor Race, devoted to the Sadeh's ideals. ==Legacy and commemoration== * The Yitzhak Sadeh Prize for Military Literature is given annually in his honor. * The Israel Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating Sadeh. * The kibbutzim Nir Yitzhak and Mashabei Sadeh in the Negev are his namesakes, as is moshav Sde Yitzhak and numerous streets throughout Israel (often named Aluf Sadeh, literally \\"General Sadeh\\"). ==References== * * == Further reading == * Dror, Zvika.

He won the Stanley Cup with the Carolina Hurricanes in 2006. ==Playing career== Wallin's career began in Bodens IK, his hometown team. Having had a breakthrough in the 1995–96 season, he was picked up by the Swedish Elitserien team Brynäs. After spending some years with Brynäs, Wallin was drafted in the fourth round, 97th overall by the Hurricanes at the 2000 NHL Entry Draft and remained at the team until February 2010. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Wallin returned to his native Sweden, playing 39 games for Luleå. In 2006, he won his first Stanley Cup with the Carolina Hurricanes. Niclas Wallin is known to many Hurricanes fans as The Secret Weapon due to his timing with postseason goals. He has only scored four of them, but all of them have been game winners, and three have come in overtime, including a game against the Montreal Canadiens in 2002 and Game 2 of the 2006 postseason series against the New Jersey Devils. The fourth one was a game-winning goal in Game 2 of the 2011 Western Conference Semi- Finals against the Detroit Red Wings. Wallin was featured in a Top 10 list on TSN's Sportscentre in 2006 after he scored a famous own goal in a game against the Washington Capitals. A delayed penalty was called on Washington, and Carolina removed their goalie from the net to get an extra skater. Wallin was chased out of the offensive zone by Alexander Ovechkin and tried to deke around a passing referee. When he did this, Wallin lost control of the puck and it sailed more than 100 feet into Carolina's open net. On 7 February 2010, it was announced that Wallin was traded to the San Jose Sharks along with a fifth round draft pick in exchange for a second round draft pick that originally belonged to the Buffalo Sabres in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. On 26 June 2010, Wallin re-signed to a one-year contract to remain with the Sharks for the following 2010–11 season. On 15 June 2011, Wallin signed a three-year contract to return home to captain Luleå HF of the Elitserien. After one season with the club, Wallin ended his professional career due to injury. ==International play== After a lengthy hockey career, Wallin finally got the call to represent Sweden in the 2008 World Championships, in which he did not disappoint, scoring two goals and two assists in seven games. == Career statistics == ===Regular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

Based on the video game series of the same name and was directed by Michael Hurst. It premiered at the Sitges Film Festival in Spain on October 14, 2005, and premiered in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel (now Syfy) on February 11, 2006. ==Plot== A few months after the events of the first film, Professor Roy Curien at the fictional Cuesta Verde University (CVU), has managed to subdue and contain a \\"Hyper sapiens\\" specimen, who is revealed to be his son, Rudy Curien (a survivor of Isla del Morte incident from the first film). Curien experiments on another survivor (Alicia), trying to determine the source of her immortality, with apparent disregard for the rotted state of Alicia's body. When Curien has created a serum that he believes will bring back the dead and grant immortality, Curien murders one of his students and injects her with the serum. She returns to life, infects Curien and breaks out of the building. A month later, the university has a full-fledged outbreak, which is confirmed by AMS reconnaissance teams. Jake Ellis, an agent for AMS, goes in search of fellow agent Alexandra \\"Nightingale\\" Morgan. He finds her on a date at a restaurant, where she must execute several infected people before she returns to base with Ellis. After being ordered to retrieve a blood sample from the originally infected specimen on campus, they are warned that missiles will level the campus at midnight, regardless of whether the agents are still present or not. She assigns a gender-mixed Special Forces team of U.S. Marines to provide them with backup. Ellis openly questions the competence of the soldiers, leading to friction between the two units. Upon arrival at CVU, the soldiers encounter zombies. One soldier panics and another becomes infected after his gun jams. When the others discover his injury, they sever his infected arm, but he turns and infects the team medic; both are executed by Ellis. The team continues forward into the university proper. They proceed to battle through the hordes of infected, splitting into two teams. Two female soldiers, Lieutenant Alison Henson and Private Maria Rodriguez, and a male soldier, Bart, investigate the dorms. They break into a female dormitory where they find the deceased naked body of a zombie. Bart attempts to pose with the corpse and is bitten by a mosquito trapped in the room. Fearing contamination but unwilling to execute Bart, who is threatening them with a handgun, Henson handcuffs Bart to a radiator and the two soldiers exit the room, falling back to the van. Meanwhile, the second team, including Ellis and Nightingale, are attacked multiple times. Eventually, every soldier escorting them is killed, including the leader of the unit, Sergeant Griffin. They fight their way to the professor's laboratory and find the original specimen still imprisoned, as well as a pair of students, Lonny and Sarah, who had survived. They enter the confinement room and extract blood from the zombie, but are forced to kill it when it breaks free. Lonny and Sarah, who had allowed them into the confinement room are overrun and torn apart by zombies, and Ellis and Nightingale escape while the zombies are feeding on the bodies. Henson and Rodriguez make it to the extraction vehicle. There, they prepare to rescue Nightingale and Ellis, but Rodriguez is bitten by a zombie who was locked in the back of the van by the soldier assigned to guard it. Henson executes Rodriguez, and the duo arrive in front of the science building as Nightingale and Ellis fight their way through a horde of zombies. Ellis and Nightingale are saved by Henson, but the blood sample vial is destroyed in the process. They are forced to turn back, with ten minutes before the military releases the missile level the campus, and fight their way back to the confinement room. They retrieve a second vial, but Henson is bitten on the ankle. She remains behind and commits suicide, as Nightingale and Ellis escape before the missile strikes the campus. Only Ellis makes it out before the missile hits, with Nightingale surrounded by zombies. Bart breaks free from the dormitory by amputating his hand and forces Ellis to hand over the vial. Bart decides to kill Ellis anyway, but Nightingale is revealed to have survived and kills Bart. His dying action is to pull the pin on a hand grenade, destroying the vial in the process. Nightingale is wounded but uncertain of whether she's infected. Ellis refuses to execute her, and the two leave together as they head to Seattle, finding that the infection has spread to the rest of the city. ==Cast== * Emmanuelle Vaugier as Dr. Alexandra \\"Nightingale\\" Morgan * Ed Quinn as Lt.

[It is] indeed an improvement over Boll's original [but it] would have worked better had it stuck to camp and not taken the whole zombie thing too seriously.\\" Bloody Disgusting rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \\"Altman’s script skewers everything in its wake, poking fun at virtually anything it can gets its bloody hands on. But underneath all the pop culture banter lies an effective film, with some palpable tension and enough blood, grue and boobs to surprise even the most jaded zombie movie hater.\\" Jon Condit of Dread Central rated it 3/5 stars and wrote that it is deserving of a chance despite its flaws. Reviewing the DVD, Steve Barton of Dread Central rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \\"It's semi-blood soaked, filled with zombies, open for business, and dare I say it, it's actually not a bad visit!\\" ==Sequel== A third film, originally titled House of the Dead 3, had been discussed since mid 2006. Mark A. Altman said: \\"It's a completely different approach to the material than the first two films and I doubt it will even be called House of the Dead 3.\\" The film directed by Patrick Dinhut and starring Dean Cain, which ended up with the title Dead and Deader when premiered on Syfy in December 2006 and released straight-to-DVD in 2007. No House of the Dead references were included in the final film. ==ReferencesCategory:2000s action horror films Category:2005 horror films Category:American action horror films Category:American films Category:American zombie films Category:Apocalyptic films Category:Direct-to- video horror films Category:Direct-to-video sequel films Category:English- language films Category:Films about fraternities and sororities Category:Films set in universities and colleges Category:Films set in Seattle Category:Horror television films Category:Live-action films based on video games Category:Syfy original films Category:The House of the Dead Category:Works based on Sega video games Category:Lionsgate films Category:Films about fratricide and sororicide ","title":"House of the Dead 2 (film)"},{"id":"3242878","text":"Treasure Mountain! is an educational computer game published by The Learning Company in 1990 for both Windows and Macintosh PCs. It teaches children aged five to nine, reading, basic math, and logic skills. Treasure Mountain is the third installment of the Super Solvers series. ==Synopsis== ===Setting=== Treasure Mountain! as well as the other \\"Treasure\\" games in the Super Seekers games, take place in a magical realm called Treasureland. The game takes place on a mountain called \\"Treasure Mountain\\". Treasure MathStorm!, a later release, takes place on the same mountain. ===Plot=== As the game opens, the Master of Mischief, a common antagonist of The Learning Company's Super Seekers games, steals the kingdom's crown and hides all of the castle's treasures. The player takes on the role of the Super Seeker once again, whose job is to find the treasures and remove the Master of Mischief from the throne. == Gameplay == The objective of Treasure Mountain! is to find the hidden treasures and return them to the chest in the castle at the top of the mountain. The mountain consists of three levels. Players cannot climb higher until they have found the key to unlock the next level. To find the key, players must get clues about its location by answering elves' riddles. When players capture an elf carrying a scroll with their net and answer the riddle correctly, they will receive a clue consisting of a number, shape, or description about where the key to the next level is hidden, as well as any magical coins the elf is carrying. In the background, there are several groups of objects that have characteristics that can be matched to the clues. Players may search behind these objects by dropping a magic coin. If the objects match all three clues, the key to the next level will appear. If the objects match only two out of the three clues, one of the stolen treasures will be revealed. After players find the key on each of the three levels of the mountain, they can enter the castle. At this point, players must climb up a maze of ladders, avoiding the Master of Mischief. When players reach the top, they deposit all treasures found into the castle's treasure chest and are given a prize - one of the treasures discovered during the game - as a reward for completing the three stages. This prize is kept on display in the clubhouse, showing how many times players have ascended the mountain. From this point, players may exit the clubhouse and start again from the bottom of the mountain. When a certain number of treasures have been deposited into the castle's treasure chest, players will go up a star rank. At higher ranks, the game becomes more difficult, as there will be more treasures to find, harder riddles to answer, and elves that steal magical coins by using elf dust. ==Development== ===Treasure series=== Treasure Mountain! is the first of four games in The Learning Company's \\"Treasure\\" series along with Treasure Cove!, Treasure MathStorm!, and Treasure Galaxy!. The Treasure series is a subgroup of the company's Super Seekers games. All the games in this series are math and reading comprehension oriented educational adventure games aimed at younger children. Games in the treasure series all have the same three stage gameplay format where a special object, whose location can be deduced by answering questions, is needed to reach the next stage. === Music === In lieu of original musical scores, Treasure Mountain! employs a number of classical pieces as background music. The music heard in the game's introduction is Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach's \\"Solfeggietto\\". The theme heard in the outdoor levels is a combination of two of Beethoven's contredanses, WoO 14: No.1 and WoO 14: No.3. The theme heard in caves comes from the first movement of J. S. Bach's Keyboard Concerto no. 1 in D minor. Level Three features the Gigue from J. S. Bach's English Suite No. 4 in F major, BWV 809. ===Later versions=== In 1994, a version with enhanced sound and graphics was released on CD-ROM. Treasure Mountain! was later released in a software bundle package with both Treasure Cove! and Treasure Galaxy! under the name \\"Treasure Trio!\\". This was one of the first software bundle packages ever sold. Treasure Mountain! was also released in a software bundle package with Treasure Cove!. ==Reception== Treasure Mountain! has received mediocre to positive reviews. Computer Gaming World gave the game four out of five stars, calling it \\"an easy-to-play, visually appealing, non-violent arcade-style game for beginners\\" with some reading ability. Lisa Savignano of Allgame gave the game 4.5 stars out of 5 stating that \\"Treasure Mountain may be somewhat repetitive, but each level will impel the kids to go onward until they finally get all 300 treasures and win the game...the game can be played over and over again.\\" Users at Home of the Underdogs gave Treasure Mountain! the Top Dog Award, an award given to games \\"(they) feel are severely underrated...to distinguish truly great underdogs from the pack.\\" They gave it a thumbs up, claiming that \\"children will be captivated by the game's vibrant graphics...They will spend many hours solving puzzles, doing math problems, and looking for hidden treasures-- sharpening their math skills without even realizing it.\\" Abandonia users gave more mediocre reviews, but said that \\"collecting toys and getting to the next level can be somewhat addicting.\\" ==Notes== ==References*Treasure Mountain! at Abandonia * *The Learning Company official site Category:1990 video games Category:DOS games Category:Children's educational video games Category:Mac OS games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:The Learning Company games ","title":"Treasure Mountain!"},{"id":"3242883","text":"Samuel Hardy (26 August 1882 – 24 October 1966) was an England-international footballer who played as a goalkeeper. ==Football career== In 1902, Chesterfield manager Jack Hoskin beat Derby County to sign Hardy, doing so under a lamp post in Newbold. Hardy, something of a shrewd character, wouldn't sign the forms until Hoskin promised to pay him 18 shillings when the original offer was 5 shillings. Hardy soon gained himself a reputation for being unfazeable and it wasn't long before he started attracting the attention of the top clubs in the country. Liverpool manager Tom Watson had witnessed him play against his side in a 2nd Division fixture at Anfield and although Liverpool won the match 6–1, Watson remembered that if it hadn't been for the performance of Hardy that day, Liverpool could well have gone on to record their biggest-ever win. After 77 appearances, in which Hardy kept 30 clean- sheets, Watson approached both Chesterfield and Hardy and signed him for £500 in May 1905. After Ned Doig had begun the season as number 1, Hardy came in to make his debut for the ninth game of the campaign on 21 October 1905 at Anfield in a league match against Nottingham Forest. Liverpool won the game 4–1 and Hardy established himself as the Reds number 1. By the end of his first season he had bagged a Football League First Division championship medal as Liverpool won their second title in five years. Hardy made 30 league (and 5 cup) appearances during the 1905–06 season as the Reds beat Preston North End by four points in the two points for a win system. In 1907, Hardy caught the eye of the Football Association committee who gave him his debut on 14 October at Goodison Park; Ireland were the opponents and Hardy gained his first clean- sheet as England won 1–0. Hardy became one of the best goalkeepers of his generation over the next few seasons and by the time he was allowed to leave Anfield in 1912 he had earned himself the nickname 'Safe and Steady Sam'. He had made 239 appearances between the sticks for the Reds when he left for Aston Villa for £1500 where he won two FA Cups in 1913 and 1920. Like so many other professionals, his career was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War. Hardy kept his eye in during the conflict playing for his own club, Villa, four times, Plymouth Argyle, Nottingham Forest and the Royal Naval barracks Plymouth. Hardy became a member of the P.F.A in 1921 and also left Villa after making 183 appearances. He joined Nottingham Forest for £1000 and helped them to the Second Division title by the end of his first season at the club in 1922. He played 102 times for Forest before injury ended his career when just shy of his 40th birthday. By the end of his international days, Hardy had played for 14 years as England's premier goalkeeper, earning himself 21 caps. Upon retirement, Hardy became a publican, keeping pubs and billiard halls in the Chesterfield area and remained so until his death aged 84 on 24 October 1966. Many goalkeeping experts – as well as England and West Bromwich Albion full-back Jesse Pennington – regard Sam Hardy as the greatest keeper of all, a statement that goes a long way to be backed up by Hardy appearing on the BBC's Football Legends List. He also was voted in at No. 94 in the official Liverpool Football Club web site poll.100 Players Who Shook The Kop == Personal life == Hardy was a relative of Nottingham Forest manager Stan Hardy. His son Jack, grandson Sam, nephew Edgar and cousins Ernest and Harry all became footballers. He served as an ordinary seaman in the Royal Navy during the First World War. ==Honours== Newbold White Star * Byron Cup: 1901–02 Liverpool * Football League First Division (1): 1905–06 Aston Villa * FA Cup (2): 1912–13, 1919–20 Nottingham Forest * Football League Second Division (1): 1921–22 Individual *Berlin-Britz Goalkeeper of the Decade (1910s) ==References== ==External links== * Official player profile at Liverpoolfc.tv * Player profile at LFChistory.net * Category:1883 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Footballers from Derbyshire Category:English footballers Category:England international footballers Category:England wartime international footballers Category:Chesterfield F.C. players Category:Liverpool F.C. players Category:Aston Villa F.C. players Category:Nottingham Forest F.C. players Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:English Football League players Category:English Football League representative players ","title":"Sam Hardy"},{"id":"3242884","text":"The black-headed spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps) is a type of New World monkey, from Central and South America. It is found in Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama. Although primatologists such as Colin Groves (1989) follow Kellogg and Goldman (1944) in treating A. fusciceps as a separate species, other authors, including Froelich (1991), Collins and Dubach (2001) and Nieves (2005) treat it as a subspecies of Geoffroy's spider monkey. The two subspecies are: *Ateles fusciceps fusciceps - northwestern Ecuador. *Ateles fusciceps rufiventris - southwest Colombia to eastern Panama. A. f. fusciceps lives in tropical and subtropical humid forests between above sea level. It lives in population densities of 1.2 monkeys per square kilometer. A. f. rufiventris lives in dry forests, humid forests and cloud forests, and can live up to above sea level. A. f. fusciceps has a black or brown body and a brown head. A. f. rufiventris is entirely black with some white on its chin. The black- headed spider monkey is one of the larger New World monkeys. The head and body length, excluding tail, typically ranges between . The prehensile tail is between . On average, males weigh and females weigh . The brain weighs . The black-headed spider monkey is arboreal and diurnal. It moves by climbing and brachiation. When mating, females may consort with a male for up to three days, or else mate with several males. Mating occurs with the male and female face to face, and can last for five to 10 minutes. The gestation period is between 226 and 232 days.

He was born in 1945 as the only child of the piano teacher and schoolteacher Alexander Kroll, born in New York as the fourth child of White Russian Jewish immigrants, and the elementary school teacher Sarah Kroll, née Mahler, born in Warsaw. At the age of eleven, he began to compose a cycle of 30 piano pieces in all tonalities, including the enharmonic relationships, to explore the potentials of each tonality to express different emotions. He called them “Episodes,” in order to distinguish them from Chopin's “Préludes.” Although of uneven quality, they represent a quarry of thematic material (partially with Russian Jewish flavor) from which Kroll was later to draw in his magnum opus, his four-act opera “The Scarlet Letter.” He had written but five of the “Episodes” when, shortly after his twelfth birthday, he composed his Piano Sonata in B Minor which, albeit still brief, is a harbinger of his later ability to create in large forms. His Symphony in G Minor, written from 1957-1959, has a performance duration of about half an hour. Kroll's further juvenilia include numerous piano pieces and a Sonata for Violin and Piano in G Minor (1958). A movement away from mere juvenilia makes itself noticeable in the ballad “Ulalume” after Edgar Allan Poe (autumn 1959), with which Kroll began, in effect, to discover his talent for vocal music. 1960 was a pivotal year for Fredric Kroll. In February, he read Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel “The Scarlet Letter” as required reading at James Madison High School in Brooklyn, and immediately set about composing the original version of the Prelude (radically rewritten in 1962, except for the beginning and the conclusion). On August 9, he discovered Klaus Mann's novel “Pathetic Symphony” about Tchaikovsky, and bought, on the same day, his first recordings of works by Gustav Mahler. Having already studied orchestral scores by Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, and Brahms, he began, in 1960, to learn the actual technique of composition by playing through the piano-vocal scores of Puccini, Verdi, Alfredo Catalani, Tchaikovsky, and Vittorio Giannini's operatic setting of “The Scarlet Letter” from 1938. Kroll was rejected by the Eastman School of Music at the beginning of 1961 because he played neither oboe nor piano sufficiently well to meet the requirements for admission. The University of Rochester urged him to choose another major, and he opted for German Literature – with the intention of teaching German to voice students later on and thus entering the world of music through the back door, so to speak. During whatever spare time his studies afforded, Kroll continued to work on his own operatic version of “The Scarlet Letter,” completing the piano-vocal score on January 10, 1965, and devoting the subsequent months to writing his Senior Essay on the influence of Schopenhauer's philosophy on Richard Wagner's “Tristan und Isolde.” He received his A.B. In German Literature from the University of Rochester in 1965. Partly as a result of the Metropolitan Opera's rejection of “The Scarlet Letter,” Kroll switched from composing operas to composing lieder, for the time being. His first collection, “Lieder aus der Einsamkeit” (1965–66), is a kind of by-product of “The Scarlet Letter” and attempts to fuse the genre of the lied with operatic elements. His following cycle to Italian texts by Henry Fregosi Loyzelle, “Frantumi” (“Shards of Glass,” 1967-69), is an antithetical experiment employing relatively sparse piano accompaniment. Kroll earned his Artium Magister (Master of Arts degree) at Yale University in 1967. Having originally intended to cease graduate school at this point and start teaching, the outbreak of the Vietnam War necessitated his studying for a Ph.D. to avoid being drafted, and he returned to Rochester, where he prepared his doctoral thesis on Klaus Mann. In the summer of 1969 he received a Fellowship from the University of Würzburg and welcomed the opportunity to return to Germany – where he had already spent his Junior Year Abroad in 1963-64, while still composing “The Scarlet Letter” - to be the first person from outside the intimate circle of the Mann family to study Klaus Mann's unpublished manuscripts - about half of which are in English - near Zurich in April, 1970. He started writing his dissertation in the fall of that year and was awarded his Ph.D. by the University of Rochester in 1973. During this time, he still struggled to compose lieder whenever possible. From 1973 to 1974, in Berlin, Kroll completed his investigations into those of Klaus Mann's major works which his dissertation had not yet covered, and then received a part-time engagement as a teacher, more of German than of English, at Carl von Ossietzky High School in Hamburg-Poppenbüttel. A stint as a commercial translator in Kirchzarten near Freiburg followed in 1975 until the beginning of 1977, when he was commissioned by the Edition Klaus Blahak in Espelkamp to write the most comprehensive biography possible on Klaus Mann. During a hiatus in this task, from 1979 to 1980, he composed Act 1 of his second opera, “Eine Nacht an der Newa” (“A Night on the Neva”), on Dostoevsky's novella “White Nights” - the subject of which he had first encountered as a TV dramatization in Freiburg in 1964. 1980 brought with it the rediscovery in Germany of German Literature in exile from Nazi Germany, and with it the rediscovery of Klaus Mann – especially of his novel “Mephisto,” which was still banned in Germany. Suddenly, Kroll's work on Klaus Mann was in something akin to popular demand. After the triumphant staged world premiere of his “Scarlet Letter” with piano accompaniment under Kroll's own direction at Cape Coral High School in Florida on January 10, 1981 (on the selfsame evening, the first Klaus Mann exposition of all time opened in Ahlen in Westphalia, West Germany), Kroll composed up to and including 2003 only two songs, “Den ungeborenen Enkeln” (“To the Unborn Grandchildren,” 1986, after Clemens Brentano) and “Der Steppenwolf” after Hermann Hesse (2000) – in his own estimation, two of his best works. During this period, in the summer semesters of 1988 and 1989, Kroll led two undergraduate seminars at the University of Freiburg. The entirety of Kroll's 3,000-page biography of Klaus Mann was published by the Männerschwarm Verlag in Hamburg on the occasion of the centennial of Klaus Mann's birth in 2006. For this occasion, and during a kind of working holiday in Fortaleza, Brazil, Kroll also edited and translated into German for the Rowohlt Verlag, Hamburg, fragments belonging to the sphere of Klaus Mann's autobiography “Der Wendepunkt” which had hitherto been published only in English (under the title “The Turning Point,” 1942), in Swedish – or not at all. After the centennial celebrations were over, Kroll began – again in Fortaleza – to carry out his intention, of which he had never lost sight, of orchestrating “The Scarlet Letter,” adding a considerable amount of counterpoint as he went along. This task was completed in February, 2010. Kroll then set nearly half of his 41 lieder for printing at the computer, orchestrated Act 1 of “Eine Nacht an der Newa,” and composed and orchestrated Act 3. Act 2 is currently being composed as of December 2016. In his own words, Fredric Kroll construes himself as a practitioner, not as a theoretician. When he started composing “The Scarlet Letter” in earnest in 1961, Robert Ward's neither musically or nor dramatically dissimilar opera “The Crucible” was premiered with success. It was not until 1964 in Freiburg that Kroll realized that the tonal and melodic Late Romantic music still today dear to his heart was considered to be obsolete and anachronistic. Kroll feels that writing only dissonances that never resolve is tantamount to an attempt to inhale without ever exhaling, to eat hot spices without meat or vegetables. To those who might reproach Kroll's music with “ escapism,” he replies that his compositions are not escapist at all, but replete with deep despair over the human condition, and that he feels it to be his mission to communicate to people imbued with compassion, to people to whom “just wanting to have fun” is alien in a world full of suffering, that they are not alone with their sorrows and their burdens. == Compositions == * Symphony in g-minor, 1959 * The Scarlet Letter, Opera in 4 Acts, 1965, World premiere 1981 in Cape Coral, Florida and German language premiere 2014 in Hamburg * Lieder aus der Einsamkeit, 7 Songs for Soprano or Tenor and Piano after texts by Goethe, Büchner, and Kroll, 1966, premiere 1982 in Wiesbaden * Romance in d-minor for Violin and Piano, 1969 * Frantumi, 8 songs in Italian language for mezzo-soprano or baritone and piano after texts by Loyzelle and Kroll, 1969 * Kerzenglut (Candlelight) in d-minor for Violoncello and Piano, 1970 * Sieben Lieder (7 Songs) for voice and piano after texts by Clemens Brentano and Stefan George, 1972 * Die traurigsten Verse (Los versos mas tristes), 19 songs for voice and piano, 1970-2006, after texts by Neruda, Goethe, Rausch, Fehse, Scheer, Roessler, and Aumeier * White Nights, Opera in 3 Acts, 2017 ==External links== * Excerpts from \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" by Fredric Kroll * Fredric Kroll Youtube videos * Frantumi performed by Elisabeth Kulmann and Eduard Kutrowatz * \\"Den ungeborenen Enkeln\\" #7 from \\"Sieben Lieder\\", text C.

This sequel to Treasure Mountain! is the sixth installment of The Learning Company's Super Seekers games and the second in its \\"Treasure\\" series. The objective of Treasure MathStorm! is to return all of the treasures hidden across the mountain to the treasure chest in the castle at the top of the mountain. Although it runs smoother and has better graphics, basic gameplay is very similar to that of its predecessor. In 1994, an enhanced and more Windows-friendly version was released on CD-ROM. ==Gameplay== The game takes place in a magical realm called Treasure Mountain. As the game opens, the Master of Mischief, the common antagonist to the Super Seekers games, uses a weather machine to freeze the mountain in snow and ice and scatters the castle's treasures all over the mountain. The player takes on the role of the Super Seeker, whose job is to find the scattered treasures and return them to the castle's treasure chest in order to thaw out the mountain. The mountain itself consists of three levels. The player cannot climb higher until he has gathered the supplies, like ice axes, ladders, or catapult parts, useful for scaling the mountain. To obtain these items, the players must help out the local inhabitants complete math- related tasks such as adjusting clocks to a given time, balancing scales, and counting crystals. In order to find treasures, the player must place a specific amount of snowballs at a certain location. To find out how many snowballs are needed, the player must catch an elf carrying a scroll. If he answers the riddle correctly, he will be told how to find treasures on that particular level. Once the player reaches the top of the castle on the highest level of the mountain, he deposits all treasures found into the castle's treasure chest and is given a prize as a reward for completing the three stages. This prize is kept on display in the player's clubhouse, showing how many times he has ascended the mountain. These prizes are usually children's toys, such as flutes or toy trains. From this point, the player may exit the clubhouse and start again from the bottom of the mountain. At higher ranks, the game becomes more difficult, as there will be more treasures to find, harder riddles to answer, and snowbullies that steal money. ==Development== ===Treasure series=== Treasure MathStorm! is the second of four games in The Learning Company's \\"Treasure\\" series along with Treasure Mountain!, Treasure Cove!, and Treasure Galaxy!. The Treasure series is a subgroup of the company's Super Solvers series. All the games in this series are math and reading comprehension oriented educational adventure games aimed at younger children. Games in the treasure series all have the same three stage gameplay format where a special object, whose location can be deduced by answering educational riddles, is needed to reach the next stage. ===Music=== Treasure MathStorm implements a number of classical pieces, most notably, Johann Sebastian Bach's Invention No. 8. ===Art and Animation === For the 1994 enhanced version, the character artwork and sprites and backgrounds were done by Fred Dianda. ==References*The Learning Company Official Site Category:1992 video games Category:DOS games Category:Mac OS games Category:Mathematical education video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:The Learning Company games Category:Windows games Category:Children's educational video games ","title":"Treasure MathStorm!"},{"id":"3242900","text":"The black-headed night monkey (Aotus nigriceps) is a night monkey species from South America.

When the Principal Chief Greenwood LeFlore stayed in Mississippi at the time of removal, Mushulatubbee was elected as principal chief, leading the tribe to Indian Territory. In 1812 he had led his warriors to assist General Andrew Jackson in the war against the Creek Red Sticks, known as the Creek Wars. In December 1824 Mushulatubbee was one of three principal chiefs leading a Choctaw delegation to Washington to seek help against encroaching European- American settlers. Pushmataha and Apuckshunubbee were the other chiefs; Apuckshunubbee, age 80, died before they reached Washington, and Pushmataha died of illness in the capital soon after their meeting with the government. On 26 September 1830, together with the Principal Chief Greenwood LeFlore and others, Mushulatubbee signed the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, which ceded to the US government most of the remaining Choctaw territory in Mississippi and Alabama in exchange for territory in Indian Territory. Other spellings for his name include: Mosholetvbbi, AmoshuliTvbi, Musholatubbee, Moshaleh Tubbee, and Mushulatubba. Mushulatubbee is noted for owning African-American slaves. ==Creek Wars== The great Shawnee leader Tecumseh visited Mushulatubbee in 1811 when he came south to get support for his Great Confederacy, in an effort to push out the European Americans. Today it is known as Tecumseh's Confederacy. Tecumseh met Moshulatubbee at his village Mashulaville (located in present-day Noxubee County, Mississippi). He was chief of Okla Tannap (Lower Towns), the southern division of the three major geographic and clan Choctaw areas of settlement. Other major divisions were in the northeast, including part of Alabama; and the west, near Vicksburg. Mushulatubbee had sympathy for Tecumseh and his cause, but decided he was too old to do anything for the confederacy, so remained neutral. In addition to fighting with Jackson and his forces against the Creek, Mushulatubbee led 52 Choctaw warriors in the Battle of New Orleans in 1814. They fought in the swamps and cypress trees, picking off many British pickets and demoralizing them. They kept shooting down the Red Coats, as they were fighting for their homeland. When the Battle of New Orleans was over, Moshulatubbee and his 52 warriors returned home. They left the service on January 27, 1815, from Fort Stoddard. ==Land cessions== Under continuing pressure from European-American settlers and the United States government, Mushulatubbee signed the Treaty of the Choctaw Trading House on 24 October 1816, and the Treaty Ground on 18 October 1820 to cede land. The US failed to prevent settlers from continuing to encroach on Choctaw territory. ==Journey to Washington== In 1824, Pushmataha, Mushulatubee, and Apuckshunubbee, the three chiefs of the Choctaw regional divisions, became concerned about the encroaching settlement of European Americans and the unwillingness of local authorities to respect Indian land titles. They still hoped to offset the government's push for removal west of the Mississippi River and resolved to take their case to the Federal government in Washington, D.C. Pushmataha led the delegation; they sought either expulsion of white settlers from deeded lands in Arkansas, or compensation in land and cash for such lands. The group also consisted of Talking Warrior, Red Fort, Nittahkachee, Col. Robert Cole and David Folsom, both (mixed-race) Choctaw; Captain Daniel McCurtain; and Major John Pitchlynn, the U.S. Interpreter. They planned to travel the Natchez Trace to Nashville, then to Lexington, Kentucky; onward to Maysville, Kentucky; across the Ohio River (called the Spaylaywitheepi by the Shawnee) northward to Chillicothe, Ohio (former principal town of the Shawnee); then finally east over the \\"National Highway\\" to Washington City. While in Washington, the chief also met with the Marquis de Lafayette, who was visiting Washington, D.C. for the last time. He hailed him as a fellow aged warrior who, though foreign, rose to high renown in the American cause. ==Candidate for U.S. Congress== In 1830 Mushulatubbee announced his candidacy for office in Mississippi in the Port Gibson Correspondent, as reported by the Christian Mirror and N.H. Observer (15 July 1830). The US government forced the Choctaw to remove to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Mushulatubbee was the chief of his division during the removal and for a time after their resettlement in what became Oklahoma. The government had encouraged the Choctaw to resettle in their former clan divisions. Relocation soon led to changes in the society in which those clan divisions became less important. In 1838 Mushulatubbee died of smallpox in present-day Arkansas and was buried near Cameron, Oklahoma in Le Flore County, Oklahoma. ==See also== *Apuckshunubbee *Pushmataha *Greenwood LeFlore *George W.

In November 1951 poor health led him to cede presidential power to Roberto Urdaneta Arbelaez. On 13 June 1953, when he tried to resume his presidency, he was overthrown in a military coup led by Gustavo Rojas Pinilla. During the three decades prior to being elected president, Gómez was a radical leader of the Conservative Party and is widely considered to be one of the most brilliant and potent orators of the Congress of Colombia. However, he remains a controversial figure because of his sympathy for authoritarian regimes and the dictatorial nature of his government.https://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/laureano-gomez/ ==Early life and political career== Gómez was born in Bogotá on 20 February 1889. He studied engineering at the National University of Colombia, graduating in 1909. He was the founder and editor of the periodical La Unidad from 1909 to 1916. He was first elected to parliament in 1911 and served until 1918. He was reelected in 1921 and served in various cabinet roles throughout the next twenty years. Gómez was widely viewed as a brilliant parliamentarian and political tactician. In 1932, Gómez gained control of the Conservative party in Colombia, a role which he relished. Under his leadership, the party became highly disciplined and provided strong opposition to the ruling Liberal Government. However, he got into trouble because of his sympathy for the dictatorship and totalitarian Axis powers. He was also an admirer of Francisco Franco and openly supported him.https://books.google.fr/books?id=R33bRfrp- PIC&pg;=PA250&lpg;=PA250&dq;=laureano+gomez+franco&source;=bl&ots;=L-TsK7v7qu&sig;=ACfU3U1UQ2mqeLBc3b4turBEJ6Q4k6GBsA&hl;=fr&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwivlf- b_MXiAhU8URUIHdo1Db04FBDoATAAegQIBBAB#v=onepage&q;=laureano%20gomez%20franco&f;=false La Colombie écartelée: le difficile chemin vers la paix He also opposed universal suffrage on the grounds of it being \\"contradictory with the hierarchical nature of the society\\".Michel Gandhillon, La guerre des paysans en Colombie, 2011 === El Siglo === On 1 February 1936 Gómez founded El Siglo with Jose de la Vega, an old school friend, fellow Conservative, and senator. El Siglo was an intensely partisan newspaper, dedicated to promoting Conservatism and Catholicism. The editors indicated that stemming the tide of secularization in Colombia was one of their primary objectives. During the Liberal Republic, El Siglo became a significant platform for criticizing the Liberal Party. Gómez elevated any Liberal misstep to the level of national scandal. And he vehemently attacked Liberal policies; every new policy announcement, no matter how moderate, was met with a chorus of denunciation and declared to be the beginning of the path that would lead to Colombia’s ruin. One political scientist described his opposition campaign as \\"so wildly vitriolic that at times it seemed to border on insanity.\\" In response to these incessant and sometimes brutal attacks, Liberals nicknamed Gómez “El Monstruo” (“The Monster”). The building housing the offices of El Siglo was destroyed during the bogotazo in the aftermath of the assassination of Jorge Eliecer Gaitán in 1948. While other structures associated with Gómez, such as his house, a restaurant he built, and the Palacio de San Carlos, were burnt to the ground, El Siglo’s building was first set on fire, and then dynamited. In September 1953, while in exile in Spain, Gómez published letters in El Siglo denouncing the military regime then in power in Colombia. As this defied censorship policies which outlawed criticism of General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla or the military government, the newspaper was closed and prohibited from publishing. ==Election and assumption of the presidency== While the country was amidst the period of unrest called La Violencia, Gómez gained the presidency in 1950 in an election in which the Liberals refused to participate. He was inaugurated in August 1950; thereafter, he continued the state of emergency instituted by his predecessor, Mariano Ospina Pérez. The activists and sympathizers of liberal Party and communist Party and the members of Protestant minority were persecuted.https://www.arcoiris.com.co/2016/05/la-caida-del-regimen- conservador-de-laureano-gomez-castro-el-13-de-junio-de-1953/ ==Korean War== Following his inauguration Gómez ordered Colombian troops to support the United Nations Command and United States forces in the Korean War. Other Conservative Party leaders opposed Colombian involvement in this war. The party was already experiencing growing factionalism and Gomez’s decision to send troops to Korea further galvanized increasing internal opposition to his rule. Nevertheless, the Colombian Battalion remained in Korea throughout the war. ==Attempted Constitutional Reform== Gómez believed that strong executive power was essential for social order. In his view, governments should be run by highly educated elites who supposedly knew what was best for everyone. Although he was not the only Colombian politician who claimed that majoritarian democracy had destabilizing effects, he was one of the most strident critics of mass politics. Throughout his political career he decried Liberals who, as he saw it, inflamed the political passions of popular classes and thereby subverted the political order. He explicitly demonstrated his disdain for majoritarian democracy in 1942, when he criticized Congress for being too beholden to the popular will and vowed to give up his Senate seat at the end of the year. Over the next several years, he used the pages of El Siglo to promote the idea of “mixed” democracy, a combination of corporate and popular rule. Three events in the late 1940s strengthened his commitment to blunting majoritarian democracy in Colombia: the mass uprising known as the Bogotazo following the assassination of Jorge Eliécer Gaitán in 1948, Congress’ failed attempt to impeach Conservative president Mariano Ospina Pérez in 1949, and Ospina Perez’s subsequent suspension of Congress in retaliation. For Gómez, the bogotazo was not only a demonstration of the pitfalls of popular rule, but also a sign that Colombia would succumb to communist revolution if nothing was done to stem the tide of increased popular political participation. Thus, by the time he assumed the presidency in 1950, reshaping the Colombian political system through constitutional reform was one of his major goals. On 28 October 1951 Gómez suffered a massive heart attack that partially paralyzed him for the remainder of his life. Nevertheless, two days later, while still in the hospital, he sent a letter to Congress outlining his plan for reforming the constitution. Although he subsequently had to request a temporary retirement from the presidency, he continued to direct the process of constitutional reform through his proxy, Roberto Urdaneta Arbeláez, who was named acting president on 5 November 1951. In early 1952, Urdaneta convened a National Constitutional Assembly; Liberals boycotted it, as did dissident factions of the Conservative Party, led alternately by Gilberto Alzáte Avedaño and Mariano Ospina Pérez. The Assembly worked throughout 1952 and ultimately produced a document with numerous provisions designed to curb popular power, strengthen executive power, and stem the secularization of Colombian political life. Presidential terms increased from four to six years. The length of congressional sessions, on the other hand, decreased. Congress was stripped of its authority to impeach the president or to elect members of the Supreme Court. Members of congress were elected through two different means: either direct popular election, or as representatives of various corporate groups (labor unions, business associations, industrialists, farmers, etc.). Congress was to be split evenly among these two different kinds of senators. The Catholic Church once again enjoyed special state protections: Church sovereignty was guaranteed and Catholic doctrine was to guide public education. Meanwhile, the activities of other religious groups were restricted. Families rather than individuals were seen as society’s most important political actor, and were therefore afforded special protection, including the provision that married men be granted two votes in local elections, while single men had only one. When the Constitutional Assembly finished its work, Gómez praised the document, claiming that enhanced executive power would prevent Moscow from asserting communist rule in Colombia and end what he described as communist-inspired violence in the countryside. He also claimed that corporate rule would eliminate the contentious political climate which he believed was caused by universal suffrage. The new constitution was to take effect in mid-1953. Before that happened, however, Gómez was overthrown in a military coup. His successor, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, eventually convened a hand-picked assembly, which was to continue the process of constitutional reform begun by Gómez. The assembly never did so, however, and the impetus for such reform withered with Gómez’s exile. ==Exile== Gómez suffered a heart attack in 1951. Although fearing for his life, he continued to control the government through a puppet successor, Roberto Urdaneta Arbeláez. With public order collapsing, General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla seized power in 1953 and Gómez fled to Spain. There he continued to lead the Conservatives in exile. He was instrumental in a 1956 agreement, the Pact of Benidorm, between the two main parties, negotiated with Liberal leader Alberto Lleras Carmago to counter the military regime. ==Return== A year after the collapse of the military regime, Gómez, representing the Conservative Party, and Lleras Carmargo, representing the Liberals, signed the Declaration of Sitges which defined the next 15 years of Colombian politics. The unique agreement provided for alternation of Conservatives and Liberals in the presidency, an equal sharing of ministerial and other government posts. The declaration and the resulting coalition divided authority between the parties until 1974. This period is known as the National Front. Gómez returned to Colombia where he continued to dominate the Conservative party until his death on 13 July 1965 in Bogotá. ==Author== Gómez was also a writer and a well known art critic; he was a patron of the arts and did much for artistic culture in Colombia. He had candid disputes with artists he criticized (such as Eladio Velez) and artists he acclaimed (such as Santiago Martinez Delgado). ==References== ==External links== *Biography of Gomez Category:1889 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Politicians from Bogotá Category:Antisemitism in South America Category:National University of Colombia alumni Category:Colombian civil engineers Category:Colombian Conservative Party politicians Category:Foreign ministers of Colombia Category:Presidents of Colombia Category:Presidents of the Senate of Colombia Category:Burials at Central Cemetery of Bogotá Category:Colombian newspaper founders Category:19th-century Colombian people Category:19th-century Roman Catholics Category:20th-century Roman Catholics Category:20th-century Colombian people Category:Colombian Roman Catholics ","title":"Laureano Gómez"},{"id":"3242911","text":"Sandy Roberts (born 22 February 1950) is a veteran sports presenter and commentator formerly working on television for Fox Sports Australia and currently on radio with Crocmedia.
