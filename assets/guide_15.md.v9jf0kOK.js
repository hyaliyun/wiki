The game was released in Brazil in 1995 and in Europe on December 8, 1995, for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. It was also ported by Eurocom Entertainment Software to the SNES and released in North America in January 1997, in Europe on November 28, 1996, and in Japan on December 20, 1996. A Microsoft Windows port was released in North America on September 30, 1996. It was ported one last time to the Game Boy by Bonsai Entertainment Corp., released in North America in August 1998. The Genesis version was only released in Brazil and Europe, apart from an American release on the Sega Channel. The game was one of the first games to be released under the Disney Interactive Studios label. The game premiered for the North American market at Walt Disney World in September 1996. Three Maui Mallard kiosks were prepared in the Disney Interactive exhibit at the Innoventions plaza of EPCOT. Visitors could play the full game for an unlimited period of time and interact with Attractions Hosts and Hostesses who were available to play against them and share tips and tricks. The game stars Donald Duck in a metafictional role as duck detective Maui Mallard, who adopts the name \\"Cold Shadow\\" when he dresses up in ninja garb. For the North American versions of the game, all Donald Duck references are omitted for unknown reasons and the main character is only known as Maui Mallard. Though the end of the game informed the player to look forward to Maui's next adventure, there have been no other appearances of Maui Mallard or Cold Shadow in any medium. The game was rereleased on the Steam and GOG digital storefronts in May 2019. ==Gameplay== Besides typical platform game gameplay (running around, jumping from platform to platform), one of the game's most distinctive gameplay features is allowing to switch the player character's form to suit one's needs. The player begins the game as Maui, whose only means of self-defence is an insect-launching pistol that can launch several forms of bugs, some of them combined for greater effect. However, once the player reaches the second level, Maui transforms into Cold Shadow, his ninja alter ego, who defends himself with short-range attacks using a bo staff. Cold Shadow's staff is also primarily used to explore the level further, such as climbing a narrow tunnel. After the second level, the player can switch back and forth between Maui and Cold Shadow at will, provided he has enough ninja tokens for the transformation. The amount of ninja tokens Maui or Cold Shadow holds determines Cold Shadow's strength – who can then chain more and more attacks as his skill improves – when played as him in the SNES version. On Genesis, however, Maui needs to collect red ninja tokens instead, the amount of white tokens being useful for metamorphosis alone. Some levels of the game, however, prevent Maui from transforming at all, as Cold Shadow cannot bungee jump on vines, for example, which forces the player to use Maui throughout the level. == Plot == Maui Mallard is a \\"medium-boiled\\" detective visiting a tropical island when the mysterious Shabuhm Shabuhm idol goes missing. Shabuhm Shabuhm is considered the island's native guardian spirit, and unless the idol is recovered, the whole island will explode. Maui is put on the case, and his investigations lead him through a creepy mansion to ancient ninja training grounds -where a witch doctor gives him the ability to change into Cold Shadow- and a native village, where Maui is thrown into a volcano as a sacrifice to the native gods. Maui survives the volcano, and the islanders put him through the \\"test of duckhood\\", which Maui passes, gaining the natives' trust. The natives tell Maui that the only one who knows the location of Shabuhm Shabuhm has long since died, and Maui goes to recover his remains from the bottom of the sea before going through the land of the dead to escort his soul into rest. Ultimately, the location of Shabuhm Shabuhm is revealed, and Maui goes head-to-head with the witch doctor at his Mojo Stronghold over the idol. Maui is triumphant, and as a sign of their gratitude, the islanders name their island after their hero, despite their misgivings that the name \\"Mallard\\" has little potential for attracting tourists. ==Release== By the 1996 holiday shopping season, the CD-based PlayStation and Saturn consoles had achieved a significant presence in the market, making third party publishers reluctant to spend money on expensive cartridges for consoles such as the Super NES. Because of this, Nintendo (which owned the factory where Super NES cartridges were made and thus could manufacture them more cheaply than third parties could) licensed the game from Disney Interactive Studios and published it in North America and Europe. ==Reception== Maui Mallard received positive reviews. Shawn Smith wrote in Electronic Gaming Monthly that it \\"has all the qualities of a great side- scroller\\", Mark East of GameSpot hailed it as \\"quite possibly the best low- tech title to come out this year\\", and GamePros Bonehead deemed it \\"well- crafted entertainment for novice and veteran gamers who are looking for great run-n-gun action.\\" Critics praised the large, non-linear levels and detailed graphics, and said that the ability to change between detective and ninja personas makes the gameplay both deeper and more fun. However, critics found problems with the controls and East said the Windows version is too choppy in full screen mode. ==See also== * List of Disney video games ==References== ==External links== * Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow at MobyGames Category:1995 video games Category:Donald Duck video games Category:Game Boy games Category:Japan in non-Japanese culture Category:Nintendo games Category:Video games about ninja Category:Platform games Category:Sega video games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games scored by Michael Giacchino Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Eurocom games Category:Capcom games Category:Sunsoft games Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow"},{"id":"3226208","text":"Schiller International University is a private, for-profit university with its main campus and administrative headquarters in Largo, Florida.

In 1981 the university acquired the former Royal Waterloo Hospital for Children and Women. In 2011 the UK announced tighter visa restrictions on international students, and as the university attracted 80-85% of its students from non-European Union countries it proved increasingly difficult to attract sufficient numbers of students. In response, in August of that year Schiller announced that it was closing its London campus and sold the site to the UK branch of the University of Notre Dame to provide dedicated student residence for its students in London.https://international.nd.edu/global- gateways/london/facilities/conway-hall/ In 2015 Schiller established a partnership with the University of Roehampton (based in Roehampton, London) which offers its students the possibility to an obtain the SIU degree, and after completion of a dissertation or thesis, a University of Roehampton degree. ==Accreditation== Schiller International University is accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools\\"ACICS Member Directory.\\" Retrieved on March 9, 2016.

It lies within the cosmopolitan neighborhood of Şişli. Its population is of Turks who moved there mostly after the Republic of Turkey was founded, Greeks (now almost completely emigrated), Armenians (who still live there in numbers), Kurds (who are relatively recent economic migrants), and Jews (who still live there in numbers). The Turkish name means \\"liberation\\", \\"salvation\\", \\"independence\\" or \\"deliverance\\". It was originally well known as an Armenian/Greek Christian neighborhood. ==History== The quarter was originally built in the 16th century as a residential area for Chian Greeks, settled here to work in the principal dockyards of the Ottoman Empire which were situated in the neighboring Kasımpaşa quarter. In 1832, a fire swept and completely destroyed the neighborhood with 600 houses and 30 shops going up in flames. Tatavla emerged as an entirely Greek part of Istanbul, while during the 19th century reached a population of 20,000 and hosted several Orthodox churches, schools and tavernas. It was nicknamed Little Athens because of its Greek character. It was typically the residential area for Greeks of more modest income, as opposed to, for example, Tarabya on the Bosphorus, where richer Greeks as well as rich Turks and Europeans lived. Nevertheless, a number of beautiful houses were built in the late 19th century, some of which still stand today. A vivid description of pre-First World War Tatavla is to be found in Maria Iordanidou's 1963 novel Loxandra, which is based on the experiences of her grandmotherLoxandra, English translation 2017, by Maria Iordanidou, pub. Harvey, pp. e.g. 26-28. Kurtuluş was also the place that ended the Baklahorani carnival, an annual event led by the Greek community of the city, which was banned by the Turkish authorities in 1943, but got revived in 2010. Six years after the Republic of Turkey was founded a fire swept through and largely destroyed the neighborhood on 13 April 1929, with 207 houses going up in flames. The neighborhood's name was changed to Kurtuluş to mark its rebuilding and symbolizing its rejuvenation. Despite the turmoil of the Balkan War, followed by World War I and the following Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) and the devastating fire, the neighborhood continued to retain a large Greek population and atmosphere, at least until the riots of 1955. ==References== ==External links== * Şişli Belediyesi (Şişli Municipality).

In contrast to other display servers, Xvfb performs all graphical operations in virtual memory without showing any screen output. From the point of view of the client, it acts exactly like any other X display server, serving requests and sending events and errors as appropriate. However, no output is shown. This virtual server does not require the computer it is running on to have any kind of graphics adapter, a screen or any input device. Only a network layer is necessary. An alternative to Xvfb is Xorg with dummy devices. Xvnc can also create a virtual display. As of 2016, Xvfb was slated to be replaced by in X.org 7.8.https://archive.today/20160511122414/https://www.x.org/wiki/Releases/7.8/ ==Usage scenarios== Xvfb is primarily used for testing: # Since it shares code with the real X server, it can be used to test the parts of the code that are not related to the specific hardware. # It can be used to test clients in various conditions that would otherwise require a range of different hardware; for example, it can be used to test whether clients work correctly at depths or screen sizes that are rarely supported by hardware. # Background running of clients.

VNC over SSH is slightly faster than X11 over SSH. In this case, Xvfb is often combined with a lightweight window manager (such as Fluxbox or Openbox) and a VNC server such as X11vnc. A possible sequence of commands to start this on the server is: export DISPLAY=:1 Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1024x768x16 & fluxbox & x11vnc -display :1 -bg -nopw -listen localhost -xkb The next step is to fire up a SSH client such as PuTTY with tunneling to localhost port 5900 enabled.

Alessandro Albani (15 October 1692 – 11 December 1779) should be best remembered as a leading collector of antiquities, dealer and art patron in Rome. He supported the art historian, Johann Joachim Winckelmann and commissioned paintings from Anton Raphael Mengs. As a cardinal (from 1721) he furthered the interests of the governments of Austria, Savoy and Britain against those of France and Spain; he was a noted jurist and papal administrator in his earlier career. ==Biography== Alessandro Albani was born in Italy on 15 October 1692 in Urbino, then part of the Papal States. He was the son of Orazio Albani. His education at La Sapienza University in Rome was towards a degree in jurisprudence. Early in life he also studied for a military career. He was made an honorary member of the military brotherhood of justice of the Knights of St. John, Rome, on 26 August 1701, at the age of nine, and a colonel of a regiment of dragoons in the pontifical troops, in 1707. Alessandro Albani descended from the Albani family (branch of Urbino), which originated from into the Albani (family) that had established itself there from northern Albania in the 15th century. Alessandro's father, Orazio, was the brother of Pope Clement XI Albani, who convinced Alessandro to set aside his budding military career, for which the weakness of his eyesight, that led to blindness in his advanced age, did not recommend him, and become a clergyman. After Pope Clement XI's death in March 1721, Pope Innocent XIII appointed Alessandro as a cardinal, on 16 July 1721 as Cardinal-Deacon of Sant’Adriano al Foro - for which Alessandro required numerous special dispensations, not least because his brother, Annibale Albani, had been made a cardinal in 1711 and still sat in the Sacred CollegeOther cardinals of the Albani family include Gian Girolamo (1570), Gian Francesco (1747), and Giuseppe (1801) (Catholic Encyclopedia). Bust of Demosthenes from Alessandro Albani's collection (Musée du Louvre). Albani developed into one of the most astute antiquarians of his day, an arbiter of taste in the appreciation of Roman sculpture, and \\"a powerful and enterprising collector of Roman antiquities and patron of the arts... He used both ancient and modern art as a form of cultural capital,\\" Seymour Howard observed,Seymour Howard, 'Some Eighteenth-Century 'Restored' Boxers', in Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes; 56 (1993, pp. 238-255) p. 238f. \\"giving away acquisitions as favours and selling them for perpetually needed funds or when they lost efficacy for him.\\" His first apprenticeship in this area was served under the papal antiquary and curator Marcantonio Sabatini.Howard 1993:239. He was the formal protector of Rome's artists as patron of the Accademia di San Luca and was a powerful advocate for his favourites. Among the works of modern artists that passed through his hands was the album of drawings by Carlo Maratti that was sold in 1763 to George III and is conserved in the Royal Collection.John Fleming, \\"Cardinal Albani's drawings at Windsor — their purchase by James Adam for George III\\", The Connoisseur 142 (1958:164-69; A. Blunt and Cook's catalogue. His worldly manner and his sympathy with the Hanoverian party in Britainwere notorious and Albani was the representative of Maria Theresa in Rome. As Austria's ally, Britain, had no official representation, Albani performed necessary duties\\\\- (Clement kept the Stuart pretender as his perennial guest in Rome) was exemplified by his friendship with Baron Philipp von Stosch, who shared many of Alessandro Albani's interests, and his correspondence with Sir Horace Mann, the British envoy at Florence,The Albani- Mann correspondence forms a large part of the documentation of Lesley Lewis, Connoisseurs and Secret Agents in Eighteenth-Century Rome, 1961. who caused Clement many occasions of concern. Named papal envoy, with his brother Cardinal Carlo, to Bologna to welcome King Frederick IV of Denmark, he was sent in 1720 to Vienna in an attempt to retain Papal territorial rights in the duchy of Parma and Piacenza, recently awarded to Charles de Bourbon, and to conclude the negotiations for the restitution of Comacchio, in the possession of Habsburg troops since 1707. Sir Horace Mann, at the request of the Cardinal, arranged for John Chute of 'The Vyne' in Hampshire, who was enjoying the Grand Tour, to spy on the Jacobites, who were in Rome making their plans for an invasion of England from Scotland. Information he collected was passed to Albani and then sent to England. Chute was a member of the Gay group known as the 'Finger Twirlers'. They included Horace Walpole and Thomas Gray the poet. Eventually, Chute was forced to flee, having been twigged. A mid-18th- century view of the Villa Albani by Giuseppe Vasi. His accommodating manner suited him for diplomatic tasks, such as the successful negotiations with Vittorio Amedeo II over conflicting rights of nomination and investiture, aggravated by the acquisition by the House of Savoy of Sardinia, over which the papacy had long-standing feudal pretensions. Accords were finalised in 1727 during the papacy of Pope Benedict XIII, for which Vittorio Amedeo thanked Cardinal Alessandro with a rich abbacy and the title of \\"Protector of the Kingdom\\". Within the Papal Curia, however, the party of the zelanti considered the accords too generous in their terms. Tensions increased with the pontificate of Clement XII, unsympathetic to Savoia. When a new concordat was arrived at in 1741, Alessandro Albani signed on the part of Savoia. As a cardinal he participated in the conclaves of 1724, 1730, 1740, 1758, 1769, and 1774-1775. He announced the elections of Pope Clement XIII (1758), Pope Clement XIV (1769) and Pope Pius VI (1775). His consistent stand against French interests brought him closer to those of the Habsburgs; Cardinal Albani represented Habsburg Austria at the Holy See, from 1756 until his death. He was appointed Librarian of the Holy Roman Church on 12 August 1761. From the time of the papacy of Pope Clement XIV he realigned himself with the zelanti against the interference of Roman Catholic monarchs in the diplomacy that surrounded the eventual expulsion and Suppression of the Jesuits from most Catholic Christian countries. He died on 11 December 1779. He was buried in the Observant Franciscan Church of San Pietro in Urbino, Marche, Italy. ==Villa Albani== Alessandro commissioned in 1745 the construction of the prominent Villa Albani in Rome. Building began in 1751 according to Giuseppe Vasi and celebrated as complete in 1763,A brief bibliography of Albani and Villa Albani is given in Howard 1993:239 note 2. to house his evolving, constantly replaced and renewed collections of antiquities and ancient Roman sculpture, which soon filled the casino that faced the Villa down a series of formal parterres. Albani's lifelong friend Carlo Marchionni was the architect in charge, at the Villa and perhaps also for the two temples in the park, an Ionic temple of Diana and a sham ruin. The Albani antiquities were catalogued by the Cardinal's secretary, the first professional art historian, Johann Joachim Winckelmann, who was supported by Albani from the time when the Seven Years' War stranded him in Rome without his pension, and whose own connoisseurship was sharpened by the connection.\\"Winckelmann, like other eighteenth-century 'Arcadians' before him, served as Albani's ally or minion, not as his director,\\" Howard observes (Howard 1993:239.). After the Napoleonic upheavals the Albani heirs sold the villa to the Chigi, who were themselves related to the Albani and by this time had added the Albani name to their own. The Chigi eventually sold it to the Torlonia, the Roman bankers, to whom the villa still belongs. Cardinal Albani's coins and medals went to the Vatican Library, over which he had presided from 1761. The sarcophagi, columns and sculptures have been dispersed, but the famous bas-relief of Antinous remains in the villa. Cardinal Alessandro Albani had another villa and park at Porto d'Anzio, that was finished in February 1732,According to the inscription on a drawing of the villa's ground-plan in the possession of Anthony Blunt, noted in The Burlington Magazine 111 No. 792 (March 1969:164f). but was habitable for a few weeks only in spring because of malaria. Perhaps the villa and a casina in the park were by Marchionni.The casina illustrated in J. Gaus, Carlo Marchionni. Ein Beitrag zur römischen Architektur des Settecento, fig. 47.

Gother himself was converted to Catholicism as a boy and on 10 January 1668 entered the English College at Lisbon, a seminary for the formation of Catholic clergy. Ordained priest in 1676, he returned to England in 1681 to work on the mission in London, where at least from 1685 he began to devote time to writing works of religious controversy. At heart, Gother was something of an eirenicist, trying to present in clear language the tenets of the Christian faith as belonging to Catholicism, with a view to convincing Protestants that (at very least) Catholic doctrine was not a hotch-potch of unscriptural superstititions; and by often emphasizing prayer and spiritual experience. Naturally, he worked in the hope of encouraging conversions to the Catholic Church. In later life he wrote many works of a devotional character, which were popular for well over a century and important in keeping up Catholic spirits in the grey years after 1688. Later, at an unknown date (possibly 1688), Gother became chaplain to the recusant family of George Holman of Warkworth, Northamptonshire, at the Castle or Manor. It was there that he instructed and received into the Catholic Church a boy called Richard Challoner, son of the housekeeper, who was later to become a Bishop and Vicar Apostolic of the London District. Challoner, one of the most impressive characters of the period of English persecution of Catholics, made his own not a few aspects of Gother's eirenicism and programme of spiritual promotion. Gother is said to have been put forward as a possible successor to Bishop Philip Michael Ellis (OSB), who had been appointed the first Vicar Apostolic of the Western District in 1688, but almost immediately imprisoned by the Revolution and then forced to take refuge first at Saint- Germain and afterwards in Rome, resigning the post as Vicar Apostolic in 1704. However that may be, Gother was sent in 1704 to be President of the College at Lisbon. Already ill at his departure, Gother died at sea, probably on October 1704, after receiving the last rites from another Catholic priest on board. Unusually, his body was preserved and brought to port. It was said this was because of the impression Gother had made by his saintliness on the ship's captain. On arrival at Lisbon it was conveyed to the English College, where it was interred in the chapel. The College remained in function until the last quarter of the 20th century. On his death he left in manuscript form a revision of the Gospel and Epistle readings for the Mass. He felt this was necessary since the Rheims Version of 1582 was becoming dated by this time. His manuscript was used by Rev. William Crathorne (1670-1739) in a series of missals first published circa 1719, which presented readings from the Mass in parallel Latin and English columns.’’ Ohlhausen, Sidney K., “John Gother’s Translation of the Gospels and Epistles,” Bible Editions and Versions, Vol. 13, No. 4, 2012, Title and sample page from an early Latin-English missal.

All such errors are duly \\"refuted\\" in the manner of the time, but courteously and in an English style that was well regarded.

Aletheia University (after Greek ἀλήθεια, 'truth') () is a private university in Tamsui, New Taipei City and Madou, Tainan in Taiwan. It was founded by George Leslie Mackay as Oxford College. It has close links to the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, and is one of the oldest institutions of higher education in Taiwan. ==History== Dr. George Leslie Mackay, a missionary from the Presbyterian Church in Canada, worked in evangelism, education, publishing and medicine after arriving in Tamsui in 1872 (during Qing rule). Soon after arriving Mackay chose a piece of land on a hilltop in the Pao-tai-pu () area of Tamsui, planned the design of the main building and personally supervised its construction. When the building, funded in large part by contributions from the residents of Oxford County in Ontario, Canada, was completed in 1882, he named the school Oxford College as a gesture of thanks to its benefactors. The original Chinese name of the school meant \\"The Hall of Reason of the University.\\" The original curriculum included courses in theology, Bible studies and reason as well as sociology, logic, Classical Chinese literature, Chinese history, the natural sciences and general courses in medicine, anatomy, and clinical practice. The school marked the beginning of general education curricula in Taiwan and is today Taiwan's institution of higher learning. Since 1994 the school has operated as a four-year independent college. Initially designated Tamsui Oxford University College, the school opened a branch campus in Madou, Tainan County in 1996 offering two-year and four-year college education. The school has borne the name Aletheia University, after the Greek word for truth, since August 1999.

The park is South Dakota's largest and first state park, named after Lt. Colonel George Armstrong Custer. The area originally started out as sixteen sections, but was later changed into one block of land because of the challenges of the terrain. The park began to grow rapidly in the 1920s and gained new land. During the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps built miles of roads, laid out parks and campgrounds, and built three dams that set up a future of water recreation at the park. In 1964 an additional were added to the park. The park covers an area of over of varied terrain including rolling prairie grasslands and rugged mountains. The park is home to a herd of 1,500 bison. Elk, coyotes, mule deer, white tailed deer, mountain goats, prairie dogs, bighorn sheep, river otters, pronghorn, cougars, and feral burros also inhabit the park. The park is known for its scenery, its scenic drives (Needles Highway and the wildlife loop), with views of the bison herd and prairie dog towns. This park is easily accessible by road from Rapid City. Other nearby attractions are Wind Cave National Park, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave National Monument, Crazy Horse Memorial, and Badlands National Park. == Annual bison roundup == The park has an annual bison roundup and auction in September, in which the bison in the park (more than 1,000) are rounded up, with several hundred sold at auction so that the remaining number of animals will be compatible with the rangeland forage. The annual roundups began in 1965; more than 10,000 people now attend each one.

Exhibits focus on the park's natural history and cultural heritage, and include wildlife dioramas, a CCC bunkhouse and a gold prospecting display. The center is named for South Dakota Governor and Senator Peter Norbeck. Many of the park's naturalist programs begin at the center. Badger Hole, also known as Badger Clark Historical Site, was the home of Charles Badger Clark (1883–1957), who was named South Dakota's first Poet Laureate in 1937http://www.badgerclark.org/ Badger Clark Memorial Society and was noted for his cowboy poetry. The house is maintained as it was when Clark lived there. Visitors can tour the home and hike the adjacent Badger Clark Historic Trail. Opened in May of 2016, Custer State Park's visitor center has information on the animals of the park, as well as a 20-minute film detailing the history and layout of the park. ==Begging Burros== Begging Burros Begging Burros refers to the donkeys in Custer State Park. For many years, these donkeys have approached cars begging for food. The Begging Burros inhabit one area of the park upon a hill where approximately 15 of them try to obtain any food they can. Custer State Park's roadway is often blocked off by these animals, so it is advised to exercise caution and patience when encountering them. ==In popular culture== Movies filmed in Custer State Park, include The Last Hunt (1956), How the West Was Won (1962) and A Man Called Horse (1970).Barth, Jack (1991).

In photography, the term \\"acutance\\" describes a subjective perception of sharpness that is related to the edge contrast of an image. Acutance is related to the amplitude of the derivative of brightness with respect to space. Due to the nature of the human visual system, an image with higher acutance appears sharper even though an increase in acutance does not increase real resolution. Historically, acutance was enhanced chemically during development of a negative (high acutance developers), or by optical means in printing (unsharp masking). In digital photography, onboard camera software and image postprocessing tools such as Photoshop or GIMP offer various sharpening facilities, the most widely used of which is known as \\"unsharp mask\\" because the algorithm is derived from the eponymous analog processing method. In the example image, two light gray lines were drawn on a gray background. As the transition is instantaneous, the line is as sharp as can be represented at this resolution. Acutance in the left line was artificially increased by adding a one-pixel-wide darker border on the outside of the line and a one-pixel-wide brighter border on the inside of the line. The actual sharpness of the image is unchanged, but the apparent sharpness is increased because of the greater acutance. Artificially increased acutance has drawbacks. In this somewhat overdone example most viewers will also be able to see the borders separately from the line, which create two halos around the line, one dark and one shimmering bright. == Tools == Several image processing techniques, such as unsharp masking, can increase the acutance in real images. Unprocessed, slight unsharp masking, then strong unsharp masking. === Resampling === Low-pass filtering and resampling affect acutance. Low-pass filtering and resampling often cause overshoot, which increases acutance, but can also reduce absolute gradient, which reduces acutance. Filtering and resampling can also cause clipping and ringing artifacts. An example is bicubic interpolation, widely used in image processing for resizing images. == Definition == One definition of acutance is determined by imaging a sharp \\"knife-edge\\", producing an S-shaped distribution over a width W between maximum density D1 and minimum density D2 – steeper transitions yield higher acutance. Summing the slope Gn of the curve at N points within W gives the acutance value A, A = \\\\left(D_1 - D_2\\\\right) \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N} G_n^2 More generally, the acutance at a point in an image is the gradient of the density (or intensity) at that point, a vector quantity: A = abla D Thus the acutance of an image is a vector field. == Sharpness == Perceived sharpness is a combination of both resolution and acutance: it is thus a combination of the captured resolution, which cannot be changed in processing, and of acutance, which can be so changed. Properly, perceived sharpness is the steepness of transitions (slope), which is change in output value divided by change in position – hence it is maximized for large changes in output value (as in sharpening filters) and small changes in position (high resolution). Coarse grain or noise can, like sharpening filters, increase acutance, hence increasing the perception of sharpness, even though they degrade the signal- to-noise ratio. The term ' is sometimes heard (by analogy with critical focus) for \\"obtaining maximal optical resolution\\", as limited by the sensor/film and lens, and in practice means minimizing camera shake – using a tripod or alternative support, mirror lock-up, a cable release or timer, image stabilizing lenses – and optimal aperture for the lens and scene, usually 2–3 stops down from wide-open (more for deeper scenes: balances off diffraction blur with defocus blur or lens limits at wide-open). == See also == * Contrast (vision) * Cornsweet illusion * Edge enhancement * Mach bands * Ringing artifact == References == == Further reading == * The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography, Focal Press, 1956, Ed.

He became a role model and martyr for the Hitler Youth and was widely used in Nazi propaganda, most prominently as the subject of novel and film Hitler Youth Quex. == Background == Born to a working class family in the Tiergarten district of Berlin, Norkus joined the equivalent of the sea scouts of the Hitler Youth organisation. He was reported to have enjoyed playing the piano and drawing. His father had been wounded in World War I, and supposedly had Communist sympathies. The official Nazi biographies of Norkus claimed his father initially opposed his son's Nazi activities but was ultimately converted and became a Nazi too. Clashes between the Hitler Youth and the Communist Red Front youth movement (Rote Jungfront) were becoming increasingly common as the NSDAP and the German Communist Party struggled for power in the waning days of the Weimar Republic. His comrades nicknamed him “Quex” because ”he carried out orders faster than quicksilver” ().Baird, Jay W.: To Die for Germany. Heroes in the Nazi Pantheon, Bloomington 1992, p. 120. == Death == On 24 January 1932, 15-year-old Herbert Norkus and other Hitler Youth members were distributing leaflets advertising a forthcoming Nazi rally. The group was confronted by Communists. Norkus fought them off and ran to a nearby house for help. A man answered and slammed the door in his face. Norkus was then stabbed six times by the pursuing Communists. He banged on another door, which was answered by a woman who tried to get him to a hospital, however he died on arrival.Baird (1992), p. 115. == \\"Hitlerjunge Quex\\" == Writer Karl Aloys Schenzinger made Norkus into a role model for the Hitler Youth in a popular Nazi novel, Der Hitlerjunge Quex (1932). In 1933, it was made into a film directed by Hans Steinhoff, with Heinrich George in a leading role as the boy's father. The novel was required reading for all members of the Hitler Youth. == Honors == Passau named a street after Norkus.Anna Rosmus Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 249f A German Navy school ship called the Herbert Norkus was named in his honor, but it was never completed because of the war.

Both markets showed price spikes in the first year of deregulation, but then settled down into a volatile but reasonably stable environment. Alberta's market is dominated by fossil fuel generation and as such reacts more closely to the price of natural gas. Ontario's generation mix is about 50% nuclear.Ontario Power Authority Long Term Energy Plan http://www.powerauthority.on.ca/sites/default/files/page/MEI_LTEP_en.pdf ===Ontario=== The consumer has the choice between buying from their local utility (Local Distribution Company - LDC) or from one of the deregulated suppliers. There is a large range of contract options from a variable price to 1,3 or 5 year fixed prices. Electricity provider switching is difficult once the consumer is in one of these contracts, unless they are close to the end of a fixed price contract.

There are however many fewer of these in Alberta. Electricity provider switching is difficult once the consumer is in one of these contracts, unless they are close to the end of a fixed price contract. There is a price comparison service operation in Canada. == France == In France, electricity market is totally deregulated and consumers have the choice between the historical formerly state-owned provider EDF and several new private providers like Direct Énergie. ==United Kingdom== Electricity supply has also been deregulated in the United Kingdom. For a list of suppliers see: Category:Power companies of the United Kingdom at the foot of the page. ==United States== In 2019, the state of Arizona, through the states' regulatory agency (Arizona Corporation Commission) considered implementing retail electricity deregulation. The proposal was opposed by Arizona Public Service Co. (APS), an electric utility that provides electricity to 2.7 million people. APS said it was opposed because the change would \\"not be in the best interest of customers,\\" according to Daily Energy Insider, because it would create issues surrounding reliability, \\"conflicts . . . with existing law,\\" and clean energy implementation difficulties. In deregulated markets such as Texas and Maryland, the state government may require the incumbent utility energy provider to allow for unlimited competition within the marketplace, where the consumer is free to choose any electricity provider. Electricity provider switching is only practical if a customer is either buying from a utility or is at the end of a fixed-price contract with a provider. Certain U.S. states allow for consumer choice in electricity providers, with Texas being the most-widely watched deregulatory scheme. Many other states are surveying the Texas deregulatory model in order to use its design as a model for the imposition of free market forces within such other power markets. As of 2019, 19 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have \\"either full or partial retail choice.\\" Along with aforementioned Maryland and Texas, electricity deregulation is current in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.

It lies 2 miles (3 km) west of Alton, just west of the A339 road. The road between Bentworth and Beech runs over King's Hill (218 m), one of the county's high points. The nearest railway station is 2 miles (3 km) east of the village, at Alton. ==History== 1826 map showing Beech FarmOne of the first examples of the village name Beech is in Greenwood's map of Hampshire dated 1826, which shows a \\"Beech Farm\\" between \\"Wivelet\\" (the current Wivelrod) to the west, and \\"Wellhouse\\" to the east, now Wellhouse lane in the current Civil Parish of Beech. Modern Beech started to take shape in the 1890s when the landowner began to sell off parcels of land for housing - much of it in the low-cost \\"colonial\\" style of wood and corrugated iron construction. This process accelerated after the First World War inspired by Lloyd George's \\"Homes for Heroes\\" programme. The small church building on Wellhouse Road dates from 1902 and the village hall at the east end of Wellhouse lane was established 1932 in a building that was previously part of a print works. At the west end of Wellhouse Road there was a well from which water was pumped by a large wooden wheel inside which was a track operated by a donkey or pony. This was still there in 2019. Since the 1960s the original colonial-style housing has generally been replaced by modern detached houses of high value. Beech used to be part of the parish of Bentworth until boundaries were changed in the 19th century. Today, the Beech Civil Parish (CP) is next to the Bentworth CP to the north and the Medstead CP to the west. ===Present day=== The village is now an affluent residential area with little commercial activity within the village boundary. The 2015 electoral roll for Beech lists 457 people living in 217 different addresses. By year 2000 the Village Hall, although well used, was in need of modernisation. Thanks to the generosity of local inhabitants in an appeal for funding, supported by the National Lottery, a programme of expansion and refurbishment began in 2008. In 2010 the new Village Hall was officially opened by broadcaster, writer and gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh , a former resident of the village. ==Geography== The Parish of Beech is located in the north-eastern area of Hampshire approximately 11 miles (18 km) south of Basingstoke, 15 miles (24 km) east of Winchester and two miles (3 km) from the market town of Alton. Beech is close to, but outside, the northern boundary of the South Downs National Park. The village has a linear nature, sitting largely within a narrow valley that descends (by minor road) for almost two miles (3 km) from Alton Abbey, which at 217 metres (712 ft) is one of the highest points in Hampshire, on the slopes of King's Hill, to the Alton - Basingstoke trunk road at 106 metres (348 ft). The area in which Beech is situated is primarily rural. The parish has an area of 5.26 square kilometres (1262 acres) and is a broad mix of woodland, farmland and, in the village area, residential developments. In the past, the area has had an agriculturally based economy, although this influence has declined with modern farming practices. ==References== ==External links== *Beech Village website *Beech Parish Council Category:Villages in Hampshire Category:East Hampshire District ","title":"Beech, Hampshire"},{"id":"3226429","text":"Beeford is a village and civil parish in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England.

He was the first American aviator flying in an American-trained air unit to achieve the status of ace. ==Early life== Campbell was born in San Francisco, California. He was the son of famed astronomer William W. Campbell, the head of the Lick Observatory and future president of the University of California. At the time the United States entered World War I in April 1917, he was a student at Harvard University noted for his athletic prowess. Campbell and close friend Quentin Roosevelt, the son of former President Theodore Roosevelt, immediately dropped out of college and enlisted in the United States Army. He would receive an A.B. Harvard Class of 1917. ==Service career== Assigned to the Air Service, Campbell learned to fly in a Curtiss Jenny aircraft and was later trained in a Nieuport fighter. He was assigned to the famous Pursuit 94th Aero Squadron (the \\"Hat in the ring\\" gang) - at this stage flying Nieuport 28 fighters. He was noted for several firsts in his service. He flew the squadron's first patrol along with two other famous aviators, Eddie Rickenbacker and Raoul Lufbery. Due to supply problems, the trio flew their first mission in unarmed planes. His first kill came while flying in an aircraft armed with only one rather than the usual two machine guns. \\"First German Plane of Lt Campbell\\" Douglas Campbell (center) poses with fellow 94th Aero Squadron aviators Eddie Rickenbacker (l.) and Kenneth Marr (r.). The aircraft in the background is a Nieuport 28. He shared credit with Lt. Alan F. Winslow for the squadron's first confirmed victories, which were the first victories by fighter aircraft of an American-trained flying unit in the war. Campbell and Winslow each shot down and captured a pilot from Jasta 64w on April 14, 1918. He became the second Air Service ace and the first by an American-trained aviator when he downed his fifth enemy aircraft over Lironville, France on May 31, 1918. Campbell was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for bravery in aerial combat over Flirey, France on May 19, 1918 and in next 3 weeks received 4 Oak Leaf Clusters. He was also awarded the Croix de Guerre avec palme by the French military. He scored his sixth and final victory on June 5, 1918. During this last action, Campbell was wounded by an exploding artillery shell and was sent back to the United States to recover from severe shrapnel injuries to his back. During his recuperation, he made appearances at numerous war bond rallies. Campbell hoped to return to combat and was reassigned to his squadron in November 1918. By then however the war was winding down and he saw no further frontline action before the Armistice of November 11, 1918. While leaving active service the following year, he continued to hold a commission in the reserves until 1924.http://www.veterantributes.org/TributeDetail.php?recordID=910 After the war, he took a job for W.R. Grace and Company. Douglas Campbell began work in April 1919 in New York. Two years later he arrived at the Hacienda Cartavio in Peru where he worked as an accountant. Cartavio was a farm where sugarcane is grown and where W. R. Grace & Co. had built the first mill to produce sugar at the end of the nineteenth century. He worked for about eleven years there. After he became the Vice-President of Pan-American Airways in 1939 and was named the airline's general manager in 1948. He died in Greenwich, Connecticut at the age of 94. ==See also== * List of World War I flying aces from the United States * Paul Frank Baer * Kiffin Rockwell - First American pilot, flying for the French, to shot down an enemy plane in 1916 ==References== ==Bibliography== *Let's Go Where the Action Is!

Bowers (June 7, 1889 – November 26, 1946) was an American cartoonist and slapstick comedian during the silent film and early \\"talkie\\" era. He was forgotten for decades and his name was notably absent from most histories of the Silent Era, although his work was enthusiastically reviewed by André Breton and a number of his contemporaries. As his surviving films have an inventiveness and surrealism which give them a freshness appealing to modern audiences, after his rediscovery his work has sometimes been placed in the \\"top tier\\" of silent film accomplishments (along with those of, for example, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd). In comic style, he probably modelled himself after both Harry Langdon and Buster Keaton and was known to the French as \\"Bricolo.\\" ==Biography== The son of Dr. Charles E. Bowers and his wife, Mary I. Bowers, Charles Raymond Bowers was born in Cresco, Iowa. His early career was as a cartoonist on the Mutt and Jeff series of cartoons for the Barré Studio. By the late 20s, he was starring in his own series of slapstick comedies for R-C Pictures and Educational Pictures. His slapstick comedies, a few of which have survived, are an amazing mixture of live action and animation created with the \\"Bowers Process\\". Complex Rube Goldberg gadgets also appear in many of his comedies. Two notable films include Now You Tell One with a memorable scene of elephants marching into the U.S. Capitol, and There It Is, a surreal mystery involving the Fuzz-Faced Phantom and MacGregor, a housefly detective. He made a few sound films such as It's a Bird and Wild Oysters, and wrote and illustrated children's books in his later years. For eight years during the 1930s he lived in Wayne, New Jersey, and drew cartoons for the Jersey Journal. After succumbing to severe arthritis, his wife started drawing them under his direction. Following a long illness, Bowers died in 1946 in Paterson, New Jersey, and was interred in that city's Cedar Lawn Cemetery.Charles R Bowers, Find A Grave.

An orchestral interlude represents their journey, in which they are trapped in a snowstorm and rescued by a Guide. Tableau 2. Arriving at an inn, the three of them set up lodgings. The Guide and the Innkeeper converse in coded language. Everyone goes to bed. Petr has a dream in which his father lies dying on a bed with his mother and servants around. Petr walks up to the scene and finds that the man in the bed is not his father, but the Guide, who tries to bless him and then waves an axe in all directions, causing a disturbance. The dream ends as a rooster crows and dawn breaks. The guests prepare for travelling again. Petr gives his coat to the Guide to stay warm. The three leave. ===Act II=== Tableau 3. Belogorsky Fortress, the square and the porch of the Commandant's house. Zharkov is helping Mironova wind her yarn, a group of invalid soldiers marches past.

However Petr refuses to be a traitor, and goes off. Pugachev is left wondering about his fate as a last string of Chumakov's song is sung. Tableau 6. A room in the Commandant's house (same setting as Tableau 4). Masha, locked in the room, is now an orphan. Shvabrin enters and begs her to marry him. She refuses, and he exits, but outside the room he runs into Pugachev and Petr. He makes up a story that she is being kept there because she is ill, and that they are married. Masha reveals the truth. Pugachev sets Masha free. Petr, who still cannot give Pugachev his allegiance, nevertheless is grateful to Pugachev. He asks Pugachev to let him and Masha leave. Pugachev agrees, tells Shvabrin to give them a pass to travel, and bids them farewell. Left alone, the two lovers discuss their plans.

It is located on the B2088 minor road above the Rother Levels five miles (8 km) northwest of Rye and ten miles (16 km) from Hastings. The northern border follows the river Rother. ==History== Beckley was part of the Wealden iron industry. An iron furnace was built in 1578, at the small settlement still called Beckley Furnace. A watermill powered the bellows. Production ceased in 1770. The 1830s saw a mass emigration of Beckley residents to New South Wales. At the time, the developing colony of New South Wales was in need of skilled agricultural labourers, whilst the English labourers were suffering hard times. Various schemes were introduced to provide finance for workers to emigrate. 165 Beckley residents took up the offer and emigrated. Amongst those residents were Thomas and Maria Ann Smith (née Sherwood), the cultivator of the Granny Smith apple. Another of those residents who emigrated at this time was Henry Charles Packham, whose son Charles, in Molong, New South Wales, was the cultivator of the Packham pear. The parish church is the All Saints church, which is located at the far west end of the town. Its isolated position indicating that the main village has relocated during its history. ==Governance== The lowest level of government is the Beckley parish council which meets once a month. The parish council is responsible for local amenities such as the provision of litter bins, bus shelters and allotments. They also provide a voice into the district council meetings. The parish council comprises seven councillors with elections being held every four years. The May 2007 election was uncontested. Current details about the Parish can be found on the official Parish Council website. Rother District council provides the next level of government with services such as refuse collection, planning consent, leisure amenities and council tax collection. Beckley lies within the Rother Levels ward, which provides two councillors. The May 2007 election returned two Conservatives councillors. East Sussex county council is the third tier of government, providing education, libraries and highway maintenance. Beckley falls within the Northern Rother ward. Peter Jones, Conservative, was elected in the May 2005 election with 49.7% of the vote. The UK Parliament constituency for Beckley is Bexhill and Battle. Gregory Barker was re-elected in the May 2005 election. At European level, Beckley is represented by the South-East region, which holds ten seats in the European Parliament.

He was a professor emeritus at the California Institute of Technology, co-founded the LIGO project, and was a co-inventor of the Pound–Drever–Hall technique for laser stabilisation, as well as the Hughes–Drever experiment. This work was instrumental in the first detection of gravitational waves in September 2015. Drever died on 7 March 2017, aged 85, seven months before his colleagues Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne, and Barry Barish won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on the observation of gravitational waves. It is generally believed that he would have won the Nobel Prize in the place of Barry Barish had he not died before the Nobel Committee made their decision. ==Education== Drever was educated at Glasgow Academy followed by University of Glasgow where he was awarded a bachelor's degree in 1953 followed by a PhD in 1959 for research on orbital electron capture using proportional counters. ==Career and research== After receiving his PhD from the University of Glasgow in 1959, Drever initiated the Glasgow project to detect gravitational waves in the sixties, after which he established the University’s first dedicated gravitational wave research group in 1970. The same year Drever was recruited to form a gravitational wave program at Caltech. In 1984 Drever left Glasgow to work full-time at Caltech. Drever's contributions to the design and implementation of the LIGO interferometers were critically important to their ability to function in the extreme sensitivity realm required for detection of gravitational waves (10−23 strain).

This is not to be confused with the sum of normal distributions which forms a mixture distribution. ==Independent random variables== Let X and Y be independent random variables that are normally distributed (and therefore also jointly so), then their sum is also normally distributed. i.e., if :X \\\\sim N(\\\\mu_X, \\\\sigma_X^2) :Y \\\\sim N(\\\\mu_Y, \\\\sigma_Y^2) :Z=X+Y, then :Z \\\\sim N(\\\\mu_X + \\\\mu_Y, \\\\sigma_X^2 + \\\\sigma_Y^2). This means that the sum of two independent normally distributed random variables is normal, with its mean being the sum of the two means, and its variance being the sum of the two variances (i.e., the square of the standard deviation is the sum of the squares of the standard deviations). In order for this result to hold, the assumption that X and Y are independent cannot be dropped, although it can be weakened to the assumption that X and Y are jointly, rather than separately, normally distributed.Lemons (2002) pp. 35–36 (See here for an example.) The result about the mean holds in all cases, while the result for the variance requires uncorrelatedness, but not independence. ===Proofs=== ====Proof using characteristic functions==== The characteristic function :\\\\varphi_{X+Y}(t) = \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left(e^{it(X+Y)}\\\\right) of the sum of two independent random variables X and Y is just the product of the two separate characteristic functions: :\\\\varphi_X (t) = \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left(e^{itX}\\\\right), \\\\qquad \\\\varphi_Y(t) = \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left(e^{itY}\\\\right) of X and Y. The characteristic function of the normal distribution with expected value μ and variance σ2 is :\\\\varphi(t) = \\\\exp\\\\left(it\\\\mu - {\\\\sigma^2 t^2 \\\\over 2}\\\\right). So : \\\\begin{align} \\\\varphi_{X+Y}(t)=\\\\varphi_X(t) \\\\varphi_Y(t) & =\\\\exp\\\\left(it\\\\mu_X - {\\\\sigma_X^2 t^2 \\\\over 2}\\\\right) \\\\exp\\\\left(it\\\\mu_Y - {\\\\sigma_Y^2 t^2 \\\\over 2}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = \\\\exp \\\\left( it (\\\\mu_X +\\\\mu_Y) - {(\\\\sigma_X^2 + \\\\sigma_Y^2) t^2 \\\\over 2}\\\\right). \\\\end{align} This is the characteristic function of the normal distribution with expected value \\\\mu_X + \\\\mu_Y and variance \\\\sigma_X^2+\\\\sigma_Y^2 Finally, recall that no two distinct distributions can both have the same characteristic function, so the distribution of X + Y must be just this normal distribution. ====Proof using convolutions==== For independent random variables X and Y, the distribution fZ of Z = X + Y equals the convolution of fX and fY: :f_Z(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f_Y(z-x) f_X(x) \\\\, dx Given that fX and fY are normal densities, : \\\\begin{align} f_X(x) = \\\\mathcal{N}(x; \\\\mu_X, \\\\sigma_X^2) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma_X} e^{-(x-\\\\mu_X)^2/(2\\\\sigma_X^2)} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] f_Y(y) = \\\\mathcal{N}(y; \\\\mu_Y, \\\\sigma_Y^2) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma_Y} e^{-(y-\\\\mu_Y)^2/(2\\\\sigma_Y^2)} \\\\end{align} Substituting into the convolution: : \\\\begin{align} f_Z(z) &= \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma_Y} \\\\exp \\\\left[-{(z-x-\\\\mu_Y)^2 \\\\over 2\\\\sigma_Y^2}\\\\right] \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma_X} \\\\exp \\\\left[-{(x-\\\\mu_X)^2 \\\\over 2\\\\sigma_X^2}\\\\right] \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma_X\\\\sigma_Y} \\\\exp \\\\left[-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X^2(z-x-\\\\mu_Y)^2 + \\\\sigma_Y^2(x-\\\\mu_X)^2}{2\\\\sigma_X^2\\\\sigma_Y^2}\\\\right] \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma_X\\\\sigma_Y} \\\\exp \\\\left[ -\\\\frac {\\\\sigma_X^2(z^2 + x^2 + \\\\mu_Y^2 - 2xz - 2z\\\\mu_Y + 2x\\\\mu_Y) + \\\\sigma_Y^2(x^2 + \\\\mu_X^2 - 2x\\\\mu_X)} {2\\\\sigma_Y^2\\\\sigma_X^2} \\\\right] \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma_X\\\\sigma_Y} \\\\exp \\\\left[ -\\\\frac { x^2(\\\\sigma_X^2 + \\\\sigma_Y^2) - 2x(\\\\sigma_X^2(z - \\\\mu_Y) + \\\\sigma_Y^2\\\\mu_X) + \\\\sigma_X^2(z^2 + \\\\mu_Y^2 - 2z\\\\mu_Y) + \\\\sigma_Y^2\\\\mu_X^2 } {2\\\\sigma_Y^2\\\\sigma_X^2} \\\\right] \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\end{align} Defining \\\\sigma_Z = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma_X^2 + \\\\sigma_Y^2}, and completing the square: : \\\\begin{align} f_Z(z) &= \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma_Z} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X\\\\sigma_Y}{\\\\sigma_Z}} \\\\exp \\\\left[ -\\\\frac { x^2 - 2x\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X^2(z - \\\\mu_Y) + \\\\sigma_Y^2\\\\mu_X}{\\\\sigma_Z^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X^2(z^2 + \\\\mu_Y^2 - 2z\\\\mu_Y) + \\\\sigma_Y^2\\\\mu_X^2}{\\\\sigma_Z^2} } {2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X\\\\sigma_Y}{\\\\sigma_Z}\\\\right)^2} \\\\right] \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma_Z} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X\\\\sigma_Y}{\\\\sigma_Z}} \\\\exp \\\\left[ -\\\\frac { \\\\left(x - \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X^2(z - \\\\mu_Y) + \\\\sigma_Y^2\\\\mu_X}{\\\\sigma_Z^2}\\\\right)^2 - \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X^2(z - \\\\mu_Y) + \\\\sigma_Y^2\\\\mu_X}{\\\\sigma_Z^2}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X^2(z - \\\\mu_Y)^2 + \\\\sigma_Y^2\\\\mu_X^2}{\\\\sigma_Z^2} } {2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X\\\\sigma_Y}{\\\\sigma_Z}\\\\right)^2} \\\\right] \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma_Z} \\\\exp \\\\left[ -\\\\frac { \\\\sigma_Z^2\\\\left(\\\\sigma_X^2(z - \\\\mu_Y)^2 + \\\\sigma_Y^2\\\\mu_X^2\\\\right) - \\\\left(\\\\sigma_X^2(z - \\\\mu_Y) + \\\\sigma_Y^2\\\\mu_X\\\\right)^2 } {2\\\\sigma_Z^2\\\\left(\\\\sigma_X\\\\sigma_Y\\\\right)^2} \\\\right] \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X\\\\sigma_Y}{\\\\sigma_Z}} \\\\exp \\\\left[ -\\\\frac { \\\\left(x - \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X^2(z - \\\\mu_Y) + \\\\sigma_Y^2\\\\mu_X}{\\\\sigma_Z^2}\\\\right)^2 } {2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X\\\\sigma_Y}{\\\\sigma_Z}\\\\right)^2} \\\\right] \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma_Z} \\\\exp \\\\left[ - { (z-(\\\\mu_X+\\\\mu_Y))^2 \\\\over 2\\\\sigma_Z^2 } \\\\right] \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X\\\\sigma_Y}{\\\\sigma_Z}} \\\\exp \\\\left[ - \\\\frac{\\\\left(x-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X^2(z-\\\\mu_Y)+\\\\sigma_Y^2\\\\mu_X}{\\\\sigma_Z^2}\\\\right)^2}{2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X\\\\sigma_Y}{\\\\sigma_Z}\\\\right)^2} \\\\right] \\\\, dx \\\\end{align} The expression in the integral is a normal density distribution on x, and so the integral evaluates to 1.

Let Z = X + Y. Then the CDF for Z will be :z \\\\mapsto \\\\int_{x+y \\\\leq z} f(x)g(y) \\\\, dx \\\\, dy. This integral is over the half-plane which lies under the line x+y = z. The key observation is that the function : f(x)g(y) = \\\\frac 1 {2\\\\pi}e^{-(x^2 + y^2)/2}\\\\, is radially symmetric. So we rotate the coordinate plane about the origin, choosing new coordinates x',y' such that the line x+y = z is described by the equation x' = c where c = c(z) is determined geometrically. Because of the radial symmetry, we have f(x)g(y) = f(x')g(y') , and the CDF for Z is :\\\\int_{x'\\\\leq c, y' \\\\in \\\\reals} f(x')g(y') \\\\, dx' \\\\, dy'. This is easy to integrate; we find that the CDF for Z is :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{c(z)} f(x') \\\\, dx' = \\\\Phi(c(z)). To determine the value c(z), note that we rotated the plane so that the line x+y = z now runs vertically with x-intercept equal to c. So c is just the distance from the origin to the line x+y = z along the perpendicular bisector, which meets the line at its nearest point to the origin, in this case (z/2,z/2)\\\\,. So the distance is c = \\\\sqrt{ (z/2)^2 + (z/2)^2 } = z/\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\,, and the CDF for Z is \\\\Phi(z/\\\\sqrt{2}), i.e., Z = X+Y \\\\sim N(0, 2). Now, if a, b are any real constants (not both zero!) then the probability that aX+bY \\\\leq z is found by the same integral as above, but with the bounding line ax+by =z. The same rotation method works, and in this more general case we find that the closest point on the line to the origin is located a (signed) distance : \\\\frac{z}{\\\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} away, so that :aX + bY \\\\sim N(0, a^2 + b^2). The same argument in higher dimensions shows that if :X_i \\\\sim N(0,\\\\sigma_i^2), \\\\qquad i=1, \\\\dots, n, then :X_1+ \\\\cdots + X_n \\\\sim N(0, \\\\sigma_1^2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\sigma_n^2). Now we are essentially done, because :X \\\\sim N(\\\\mu,\\\\sigma^2) \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma} (X - \\\\mu) \\\\sim N(0,1). So in general, if :X_i \\\\sim N(\\\\mu_i, \\\\sigma_i^2), \\\\qquad i=1, \\\\dots, n, then : \\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i X_i \\\\sim N\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\\\mu_i, \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (a_i \\\\sigma_i)^2 \\\\right). ==Correlated random variables== In the event that the variables X and Y are jointly normally distributed random variables, then X + Y is still normally distributed (see Multivariate normal distribution) and the mean is the sum of the means. However, the variances are not additive due to the correlation. Indeed, :\\\\sigma_{X+Y} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma_X^2+\\\\sigma_Y^2+2\\\\rho\\\\sigma_X \\\\sigma_Y}, where ρ is the correlation. In particular, whenever ρ < 0, then the variance is less than the sum of the variances of X and Y. Extensions of this result can be made for more than two random variables, using the covariance matrix. ===Proof=== In this case (with X and Y having zero means), one needs to consider :\\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi \\\\sigma_x \\\\sigma_y \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\rho^2}} \\\\iint_{x\\\\,y} \\\\exp \\\\left[ -\\\\frac{1}{2(1-\\\\rho^2)} \\\\left(\\\\frac{x^2}{\\\\sigma_x^2} + \\\\frac{y^2}{\\\\sigma_y^2} - \\\\frac{2 \\\\rho x y}{\\\\sigma_x\\\\sigma_y}\\\\right)\\\\right] \\\\delta(z - (x+y))\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}y. As above, one makes the substitution y\\\\rightarrow z-x This integral is more complicated to simplify analytically, but can be done easily using a symbolic mathematics program. The probability distribution fZ(z) is given in this case by :f_Z(z)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi}\\\\sigma_+ }\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{z^2}{2\\\\sigma_+^2}\\\\right) where :\\\\sigma_+ = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma_x^2+\\\\sigma_y^2+2\\\\rho\\\\sigma_x \\\\sigma_y}. If one considers instead Z = X − Y, then one obtains :f_Z(z)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi(\\\\sigma_x^2+\\\\sigma_y^2-2\\\\rho\\\\sigma_x \\\\sigma_y)}}\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{z^2}{2(\\\\sigma_x^2+\\\\sigma_y^2-2\\\\rho\\\\sigma_x \\\\sigma_y)}\\\\right) which also can be rewritten with :\\\\sigma_-=\\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma_x^2+\\\\sigma_y^2-2\\\\rho\\\\sigma_x \\\\sigma_y}. The standard deviations of each distribution are obvious by comparison with the standard normal distribution. ==References== ==See also== * Propagation of uncertainty * Algebra of random variables * Stable distribution * Standard error (statistics) * Ratio distribution * Product distribution * Slash distribution * List of convolutions of probability distributions Category:Normal distribution ","title":"Sum of normally distributed random variables"},{"id":"3226625","text":"DaySide was an American news/talk show on the Fox News Channel, which aired weekdays at 1:00 p.m. ET.

Bird (11 March 1926 – 28 October 2005) was US Commandant of the Spandau Allied Prison from 1964 to 1972 where, together with six others, Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess was incarcerated. In March 1971, Bird’s superiors at the US Mission in Berlin became aware of Bird's cooperation with Hess in the writing of a book about Hess. He was put under house arrest and eventually made to resign his position as Commandant of Spandau Prison. This episode, in effect, also ended his military career. ==Biography== Eugene K. Bird was born in Lambert, Montana, United States. In 1944, Bird joined the U.S. Army. He was sent to Europe, where he fought against the Axis Powers. After the Nuremberg trials of the major Nazis, the old prison at Spandau in the western suburb of Berlin was adapted by the Allies to incarcerate the seven convicted senior Nazis who were not executed at Nuremberg. In 1964, Bird was appointed U.S. Commandant of the Spandau Allied Prison. By late 1966, the only remaining prisoner incarcerated there was Rudolf Hess. ==Relationship with Rudolf Hess== Over the years, and after many hundreds of hours of discussion between the two, there developed a friendly relationship between them and they began a surreptitious collaboration on a book about Hess and his enigmatic flight to Scotland in 1941. Both Bird and Hess saw this as an opportunity to set the record straight, as far as possible, about Hess's historic flight. Bird’s main interest was to learn from Hess about whether or not Hitler knew about Hess’s mission, and whether or not Hess knew about the plans for Operation Barbarossa when he took off on his flight to Scotland. In March 1971, Bird’s superiors at the U.S. Mission in Berlin became \\"officially\\" aware (Bird claimed he had submitted pages of the manuscript to various officials long before this) of the Bird/Hess manuscripts and other documents relating to the proposed book. Bird was interrogated in great detail, placed under house arrest, and eventually made to resign his position as Commandant of Spandau Prison. This episode, in effect, also ended his military career. ==After Spandau== Bird and his family relocated to Germany permanently. His book about Hess, The Loneliest Man in the World, was published by Secker & Warburg in 1974, in London. In the Epilogue, Bird describes in detail his interrogation and, indirectly, accuses his superiors and brother officers of gross hypocrisy: many of them knew of his labours, he wrote, and some had even read the manuscripts and encouraged him with the project. After the publication of the book, Bird campaigned to have Hess released from what had effectively become permanent solitary confinement after Albert Speer and Baldur von Schirach were released in 1966. Hess allegedly committed suicide in August 1987 aged 93 in Spandau Prison and Bird publicly voiced his concern that Hess may have been murdered. Bird died in his Berlin home on October 28, 2005. He was survived by his wife and two daughters and was buried at the Waldfriedhof Cemetery in Berlin. ==References== * * ==External links== * More information regarding Lt.Col Eugene K Bird Category:1926 births Category:2005 deaths Category:United States Army colonels Category:American prison wardens Category:People from Richland County, Montana Category:American expatriates in Germany ","title":"Eugene K.

The character first appears as a nanny hired by Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) to care for his children, and later marries him. Laura was killed-off after falling down the stairs, shortly after a fight with Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), a departure that was listed as one of EastEnders best exits by Virgin Media. This was Waterman's second role in the soap, having appeared in 1997 as an HIV patient. ==Storylines== Laura is employed by local businessman Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) as a nanny for his children, Peter (Joseph Shade), Lucy (Casey Anne Rothery) and Steven Beale (Edward Savage). She becomes attracted to Ian but her attempts to get closer to him are unnoticed. Laura is protective of Ian and eventually Ian starts to see her as loyal and faithful but uses her for sex. Eventually, Laura demands more commitment but he refuses so Laura calls off their arrangement and kisses Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves). Ian is furious when he finds out, leading to Laura's resignation, but before she leaves, Ian is declared bankrupt so Laura agrees to stay and help him look after the children, and they become a couple. Laura tries to raise money to buy the fish and chip shop so they can run it together, secretly borrowing money from his former wife, Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite). Ian proposes marriage to Laura but her wealthy father opposes their relationship because of Ian's bankruptcy. They get married but Laura discovers that Ian knows about an inheritance she received and wonders if Ian only wants her money. Ian convinces her this is not true. Laura is jealous when Ian goes into business with Mel. She catches them kissing and moves out, but Ian wins her round again. When Mel is arrested for money laundering and drug dealing (she was set up by her husband, Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), she signs her business over to Laura, worried about them being seized by the authorities but Laura refuses to give them back. Mel is arrested, and when released on bail, informs Ian of Laura's spiteful deed, and tells Laura that she was Ian's first choice. Laura delights in belittling Ian and decides she wants a baby. Ian refuses and Laura is heartbroken when she discovers Ian has been paying Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) to sleep with him. Janine goes to Laura's house because she feels guilty; they argue and Laura throws a pan of boiling milk at Janine, putting her in hospital and causing a feud between them. Laura reconciles with Ian on the promise that they will have a baby, but he has a secret vasectomy. Laura gets pregnant and, believing that he cannot be the father, Ian cons her into signing her share of the businesses over to him and throws her out. Laura tells Garry he is the father, following a drunken night together. Garry's wife Lynne Hobbs (Elaine Lordan) throws him out so they move into a bedsit together. Laura gives birth to Bobby Beale (Kevin Curran), but he needs a blood transfusion and Laura learns that Garry is not Bobby's father but, given Ian's lack of interest and wanting her son to have a father, Laura doesn't tell Garry. Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) appoints Laura as the manager of the café Ian used to own and she names it \\"Laura's\\", but Phil's sister, Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf), sells the café to Ian and he sacks Laura.

Janine is charged with murdering Laura but is cleared when Pat is eventually persuaded to give Janine an alibi. She also finds Laura's letter to Ian and blood tests confirm Ian is Bobby's father. He feels guilty for the way he treated Laura and takes custody of Bobby. ==Creation and development== ===Casting=== On 6 January 2000, it was announced Waterman would be joining EastEnders as Laura Dunn, a nanny hired by Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) to care for his children. It was also reported \\"romance could be on the cards\\" for Laura and Ian. Waterman previously appeared in EastEnders in 1997 as an HIV patient. Shortly after she joined the show, Waterman began to be recognised by members of the public and she commented \\"It can be quite intimidating when people stare at me in the street, so I've resorted to doing what I never dreamed of before - wearing a baseball cap to go shopping. It's interesting being on the show, especially with dad being a Cockney. And I'd love to work with him one day. So far, I've avoided it in case I was accused of using his name to get on, but now we joke about working together on EastEnders. I can just picture him behind the bar at The Queen Vic!\\" ===Relationship with Ian Beale=== Waterman said there were perks to playing a couple at war in TV soaps.\\" \\"After a day of nagging Adam and moaning about just about everything, I feel fantastic by the time I get home,\\" she laughs. \\"If Laura's having a bad day that usually means I finish off the day in a great mood. It's a very cathartic experience being a misery-guts for a living.\\" She continues: \\"I don't know if she'll forgive him but I doubt she'll throw Ian out. Laura has shifted from being this naïve and soft person into a much harder and more manipulative character. That's what happens when you live with Ian Beale for too long.\\" Talking about how Laura manipulated Ian, Waterman commented: \\"I wouldn't be surprised if she uses Ian's guilt to get her way,\\" she says. \\"She desperately wants a baby. Now she may be in a position to demand she gets her way. Laura's love for Ian has been tested lately. Her love for him is far less than her desire to have a baby and that's going to be a problem for Ian.\\" ===Departure and death=== On 25 February 2004 it was announced Waterman was to leave EastEnders, and her character was killed off after falling down the stairs, shortly after a fight with Janine Butcher. A spokeswoman for the show said Laura's exit would spark \\"a succession of devastating events throughout Walford.\\" Waterman revealed she was glad Laura was going to be killed off and that she has to move on from EastEnders. She explained \\"These are my last scenes, but they're so dramatic. Though I've had a fabulous time, I've got to move on.\\" Waterman also stated that she could not wait for Laura to be killed off. She expressed that she wanted to do other work, particularly with her father, Dennis Waterman, saying \\"I've never worked with him before. And he's not unhappy I'm leaving. EastEnders has been a fantastic learning curve but I can't play that character any more.\\" ==Reception== Laura's departure was listed as one of EastEnders best exits by Virgin Media.

The latest edition of Look North is also available to watch on the BBC iPlayer. ==History== The \\"Pink Palace\\" - the studio and office complex of BBC Look North and BBC Newcastle Prior to the start of Look North, the BBC television region for the North East and Cumbria launched at 6.10pm on Monday 5 January 1959 from studios at 54 New Bridge Street in Newcastle City Centre. The region began receiving its own nightly news bulletins, originally presented by George House and Tom Kilgour. Previously, the area was served by a pan-regional bulletin from Manchester entitled News from the North, broadcast across the whole of Northern England from 30 September 1957 onwards. The new local bulletins from Newcastle were launched ten days before the opening of rival ITV station Tyne Tees Television in the North East (Border Television, serving Cumbria, opened in September 1961). Three years after the launch of the television service, the bulletins were expanded to 20 minutes and relaunched as a daily magazine programme, Home at Six, presented by Frank Bough. After Bough left to join BBC Sport in 1964, Home at Six was relaunched with a new name and a new presenter - Mike Neville, an actor and continuity announcer for Tyne Tees Television who had been anchor of North East Newsview, a nightly regional news programme, for only a few months. Neville soon became a household name and spent the next thirty-two years at the BBC in Newcastle, presenting Look North as well as making regular appearances on Nationwide. For a short period in the late 1980s, Cumbria was switched to the BBC North West region and began receiving North West Tonight instead of Look North, along with a short lunchtime news opt-out. Look North returned to Cumbria on 27 September 1992.https://www.flickr.com/photos/selmerorselnec/46180465521 The North East and Cumbria region was reformed after campaigning by viewers in Cumbria that they were being overlooked in favour of news from the more populous areas of the north west, such as Greater Manchester and Merseyside. It was during this time that on 16 January 1988, BBC North East moved to brand new purpose built studios nicknamed 'The Pink Palace' on Barrack Road (A189) in Spital Tongues, along with Radio Newcastle. In 1996, Mike Neville left the BBC after 32 years to re-join Tyne Tees Television to present their flagship evening news programme North East Tonight. Look North underwent major changes with new presenters Carol Malia and John Lawrence (both former reporters for Tyne Tees) introduced to the programme. Malia is now the sole presenter. ==Broadcast times== On weekdays, Look North broadcasts six three-minute opt- outs during BBC Breakfast at 27 minutes past and 3 minutes to each hour. A ten-minute lunchtime programme follows at 1:35pm with the main half-hour edition at 6:30pm and a ten-minute late update is shown at 10:25pm, following the BBC News at Ten. Look North also airs three bulletins during the weekend: early evening bulletins on Saturday and Sunday and a late night bulletin on Sundays, following the BBC News at Ten. The times of these bulletins usually vary. ==Presenters== News *Carol Malia - Main presenter (Monday-Wednesday) and Wednesday lates *Jeff Brown *Dawn Thewlis Weather *Paul Mooney *Keeley Donovan *Paul Hudson *Lisa Gallagher ==Former on air team== { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin:1em 1em 1em 0; background:#f9f9f9; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse; font- size:90%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#FF0000\\" align=\\"center\\" !

Hickox was launched 4 July 1943 by Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Kearny, N.J.; sponsored by Mrs. Ralph Hickox, wife of the late Commander Hickox; and commissioned 10 September 1943, Comdr. William M. Sweetser in command. == World War II == After shakedown in the Caribbean, Hickox departed Norfolk, Virginia 21 November and reported to Pearl Harbor 12 December. Joining Admiral Marc Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task Force (then U.S. Fifth Fleet's TF 58, later U.S. Third Fleet's TF 38) as part of the destroyer screen, Hickox sailed 16 January 1944 to participate in the first \\"neutralization\\" raids against Marshall Islands airfields. In the next few months she helped shepherd the powerful aircraft carriers through raids on Truk, the Marshalls, and New Guinea. On 1 April Hickox teamed up with the destroyer to destroy two small Japanese cargo vessels off Woleai Island. She chalked up another enemy ship, a small picket boat, 13 June in the Marianas. After guarding the carriers as their planes launched initial strikes on both Wake Island and Saipan in early June, Hickox accompanied other units of the task force in patrolling western Marianas waters in anticipation of engagement with a large enemy surface force. These anticipations were met 19 June as the Battle of the Philippine Sea was joined. In this 2-day air struggle, the Japanese fleet lost 395 (92%) of its carrier planes, 31 (72%) of its float planes, and an estimated 50 land-based planes. During the famed \\"Marianas Turkey Shoot\\", as the Navy fondly termed it, Hickox was in on the kill of at least five aircraft and also rescued three splashed fliers. Japanese naval air never recovered from this defeat. For the rest of the summer she remained with TF 58 as the carriers launched preliminary air strikes against enemy positions on Iwo Jima and Guam. On 11 September Hickox joined Admiral William F. Halsey's Third Fleet in Philippine waters to protect carriers whose planes two days later launched initial strikes against the former American islands. After raids on Okinawa and Formosa 12-13 October, Hickox turned back to Philippine waters to participate in the Battle for Leyte Gulf, Japan's last desperate effort to resist the overwhelming American advance across the Pacific. In four separate battles 24-26 October the once- proud Japanese fleet was devastated by the loss of three battleships, 10 cruisers, 4 carriers, 9 destroyers, and a submarine. Through 7 November Hickox remained with the Third Fleet, under almost constant Japanese air attack, to screen air strikes against Manila before retiring to Ulithi. Rejoining the carriers 14 November, Hickox escorted them to further strikes in the Philippines and 11 December support of the Mindanao landings. In the savage typhoon which struck the Philippines 17 December, Hickox lost steering control in howling winds estimated at , but regained power and control in time to shepherd a group of tankers to safety at Ulithi 23 December. Rejoining Task Force 58 1 February 1945, Hickox screened the carriers 16 February as they launched the first raids against Tokyo since the famed Halsey-Doolittle raid of April 1942. Further strikes against the Japanese home islands and in support of the already-launched Iwo Jima invasion kept Hickox at sea well into the spring. On 19 March the carrier was severely damaged by a kamikaze and Hickox lowered her whaleboat and steamed in the listing ship's wake to rescue her crew. After rescuing some 70 men from the water, the daring destroyer sailed directly under the flaming carrier's fantail to rescue 18 men from the ship and 3 more from the water. In addition, Hickoxs effective antiaircraft fire drove off two more kamikaze attacks on the damaged Franklin. After escorting the carrier to Ulithi 24 March, Hickox sailed 5 April to join support forces off Okinawa, where battle had been raging four days as American forces sought to take the Japanese bastion, last obstacle before invasion of the home islands. Off Okinawa Hickox engaged in screening and radar picket duties. While coming under fierce air attack, the battle-hardened DD gave as good as she received, downing and assisting in the kill of several Japanese planes. Detached from duty there 29 May, Hickox proceeded to Guam and from there sailed for home via San Pedro and Pearl Harbor. Steaming under the Golden Gate Bridge 6 July, the veteran warrior underwent repairs, her first since departing the States 18 months earlier, and was still there when the long Pacific war ended 2 September with the signing of the armistice in Tokyo Bay. Hickox decommissioned and went into reserve at San Diego 10 December 1946. == 1951-1957 == Hickox underway in 1956. Hickox recommissioned 19 May 1951, following the outbreak of war in Korea that accelerated the need for seapower. She arrived Newport, Rhode Island, her new home port, 13 October to join the Atlantic Fleet. After tactical exercises along the coast and in the Caribbean, she and the other destroyers of Destroyer Squadron 20 (DesRon 20) sailed 6 September on what was to become an around-the-world cruise. Hickox spent two winter months on duty off Korea screening the fast carriers of Task Force 77, furnishing gunfire support, and patrolling along the peninsula. She and her sister ships returned to Newport in April 1953 via Singapore, Calcutta, Ceylon, Naples, and Gibraltar to terminate their 7½-month cruise. Further exercises occupied her until 8 September 1954, when Hickox sailed for a 5-month cruise to Northern and Mediterranean Europe. NATO and fleet maneuvers as well as good-will visits consumed most of Hickoxs tour, see inset pics. Returning to the States 7 February 1955, Hickox made one more Mediterranean cruise in the summer of 1957 during which she stood by in the eastern Mediterranean to prevent further unrest and bloodshed in the wake of an attempted coup against King Hussein of Jordan. Returning to the States 30 August, Hickox sailed to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania two weeks later and decommissioned there to join the Atlantic Reserve Fleet 20 December 1957. == ROKS Pusan == Hickox was transferred to South Korea 15 November 1968, where she served in the Republic of Korea Navy as ROKS Pusan, named after the city of Pusan. Pusan was stricken and broken up for scrap in 1989. == Awards == Hickox received nine battle stars for World War II service and two for Korean War service. == References == * == External links == * navsource.org: USS Hickox * hazegray.org: USS Hickox Category:Fletcher-class destroyers of the United States Navy Category:Ships built in Kearny, New Jersey Category:1943 ships Category:World War II destroyers of the United States Category:Cold War destroyers of the United States Category:Korean War destroyers of the United States Category:Ships transferred from the United States Navy to the Republic of Korea Navy ","title":"USS Hickox"},{"id":"3226726","text":"Events in the year 1919 in India. ==Incumbents== * Emperor of India – George V * Viceroy of India – Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford ==Events== *13 April - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallianwala_Bagh_massacreJallianwala Bagh massacre *15 April – Disturbances in Delhi and Punjab and martial law in Punjab (back dated to 30 March);. *6 April – Mahatma Gandhi declared an All India Strike against the Rowlatt Act. *11 April – Serious riots in Ahmedabad.Everyman's Dictionary of Dates; 6th ed.

Bomjon has also been accused of violent attacks, sexual assault and false imprisonment by victims and witnesses. He is currently under investigation for rape, and separately for the disappearance of four of his ashram members. == Details == Bomjon's followers believe he is an incarnation of the historical Buddha, Gautama. Bomjon has rejected any such comparisons, saying \\"Tell the people not to call me a Buddha. I don't have the Buddha's energy currently. I am at the level of a rinpoche.\\" Mahiswor Raj Bajracharya, the president of the Nepal Buddhist Council, has stated likewise: \\"We do not believe he is Buddha. He does not have Buddha's qualities\\". He went missing on March 11, 2006. On March 19, 2006 Bed Bahadur Lama of the Om Namo Buddha Tapaswi Sewa Samiti (ONBTSS) told reporters that they had seen him in Bara District and that they had spoken to him for half-an-hour, during which Bomjon reportedly assured of returning in six years. He was again seen in August 2007, preaching to crowds in Nepal’s Hallori jungle, around 100 miles south of Kathmandu. == Controversies == Claims by Bomjon's followers of his meditating for months without eating or sleeping have been disputed by reporters. In 2010, Bomjon was investigated for attacking a group of 17 villagers. Bomjon claimed that they were intentionally disturbing and imitating his meditation, though the villagers said they were just looking for vegetables. Bomjon claimed to have taken \\"minor action\\" against them with just his hands after they had \\"tried to manhandle\\" him, and to have stopped as soon as they apologized. However the victims claim that for three hours he struck them on their head and back with an axe handle, resulting in serious injury to one of the victims. Bomjon refused to attend any potential trial, saying, \\"Do you think a meditating sage will go to the court to hear a case? I took action against them as per the divine law\\". In 2012 Nepal Police announced that they had rescued a Slovak woman from Bomjon's followers, but other reports claimed that she had been voluntarily released after media coverage of the kidnapping. Newsweek reported she had been taken from a hotel by two of Bomjon's men riding on a motorcycle and kept tied to a tree for three months and accused of practicing witchcraft in order to disturb the Boy’s meditation. However another report claimed she had been taken from a monastery. When she was released she had a broken arm. A week after her release, Bomjon's siblings accused him of holding his brothers captive overnight, and for beating one of his brothers and his sister. Soon after, followers of Bomjon assaulted five journalists and destroyed their cameras after they had recorded one of Bomjon's sermons. In September 2018, Bomjon was accused of raping an 18 year old nun repeatedly for nearly 2 years. During a press conference organized by women's rights groups, the nun also accused his wife of trying to keep the abuse hidden so as not to \\"attract attacks\\" on their religion. Supporters of Bomjon claim that the nun was in fact involved in theft, and had been ejected from the monastery. An investigation was opened in early 2019 after complaints from family members that four devotees had gone missing from several of Bomjon's ashrams. == See also == * Buddhism * Buddha claimants * Maitreya claimants == References == == External links == Category:1990s births Category:21st-century Buddhists Category:Living people Category:People from Bara District Category:Nepalese Buddhists ","title":"Ram Bahadur Bomjon"},{"id":"3226761","text":"Terance Paul Mathis (born June 7, 1967) is an American former Pro Bowl wide receiver in the NFL.

Produced by Sam Raimi, the film was directed by Takashi Shimizu, written by Stephen Susco and stars an ensemble cast that includes Amber Tamblyn, Arielle Kebbel, Jennifer Beals, Edison Chen, Sarah Roemer and Sarah Michelle Gellar. As stated by Shimizu, the film is not a remake of any Japanese film and follows a different storyline. Like its predecessor, the film features a plot that is told through a non-linear sequence of events and includes several intersecting subplots. The three main subplots include: Karen's younger sister Aubrey coming to Japan after finding out about Doug's death, a schoolgirl named Allison being hunted by the ghosts after entering the house with two of her classmates and a young boy named Jake whose apartment building is haunted by the ghosts of the Saeki family. The film was announced after the release of the previous film in October 2004, due to its financial success. Shimizu was announced to return as director on January 2005 and casting begun on December, with the announcement of Gellar returning. The film was shot entirely in Japan, with Tamblyn performing re-shoots in Chicago, Illinois. The Grudge 2 was theatrically released in the United States on October 13, 2006, by Columbia Pictures. The film received generally negative reviews, and made over $70 million worldwide against a $20 million budget. A sequel, The Grudge 3, was released direct-to-video on May 12, 2009, while a sidequel, The Grudge, was theatrically released on January 3, 2020. ==Plot== The Grudge is described as a curse that is born when someone dies in the grip of extreme rage or sorrow. The curse is an entity created where the person died. Those who encounter this supernatural force die and the curse is reborn repeatedly, passing from victim to victim in an endless, growing chain of horror. The following events are explained in their actual order, however, the film is presented in a nonlinear narrative. In 2004, American social worker Karen Davis tried to burn down the Saeki house to stop the curse, but failed, finding herself hospitalised and haunted by Kayako. Karen's younger sister, Aubrey, goes to Tokyo to retrieve her. In Japan, Aubrey struggles to communicate with the hospital staff but a journalist named Eason aids her. Aubrey briefly speaks with Karen, who panics and has to be restrained. Karen is later killed by Kayako in front of Aubrey and Eason. Eason explains the curse to Aubrey, revealing he rescued Karen from the house fire and has been investigating the Saeki murders and surrounding events. The two go to the house to retrieve Kayako's diary, but Toshio drags Aubrey inside to curse her. Eason takes the diary to an associate, who explains Kayako's mother was an itako who exorcised evil spirits from visitors and fed them to her daughter. Eason and Aubrey make plans to visit Kayako's mother. As Eason develops photographs he took of the Saeki house, Kayako emerges from a photo and murders him. After discovering his body, Aubrey travels alone to Kayako's mother's remote rural home. Kayako's mother warns her the curse is irreversible before being killed by her daughter. Aubrey ventures to the house, following an image of Karen inside. She encounters Takeo's ghost, who reenacts the night he discovered his wife's disloyalty and snaps Aubrey's neck. In 2006, school girls Allison Fleming, Vanessa Cassidy and Miyuki Nazawa break into the house on a dare, but Allison is locked in the closet and encounters Kayako's ghost but the girls escape. After Miyuki and Vanessa are consumed by the curse, Allison speaks with school counsellor Ms. Dale about the curse, but Dale denies its existence, revealing she went to the house and is actually a ghost herself. Allison is haunted by the ghosts of her friends and she eventually flees back to Chicago, where she stays with her parents. The Kimbles move into an apartment block in Chicago. A young boy named Jake is disturbed by a strange presence in the building brought about by a hooded stranger who covers windows with newspaper. Jake's father Bill and stepmother Trish are influenced by the curse, Bill accusing his wife of having an affair and he bludgeons her with a frying pan. Jake and his sister, Lacey, return from school, but Jake finds his family are all dead. He runs into the hooded person, revealed to be Allison, who explains the curse followed her. Kayako appears in Allison's hood, finally taking her and then emerges to attack Jake. ==Cast== * Amber Tamblyn as Aubrey Davis, Karen's younger sister * Arielle Kebbel as Allison Fleming, a shy and emotional exchange student from Chicago, Illinois USA who attended Tokyo International School in Tokyo, Japan. * Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen Davis, the sole, traumatized survivor of The Grudge * Takako Fuji as Kayako Saeki, wife of Takeo Saeki, mother of Toshio Saeki, daughter of Nakagawa Kawamata and the titular role of the movie. ** Kyoka Takizawa as Young Kayako * Edison Chen as Eason, a journalist who is investigating the Saeki murders * Teresa Palmer as Vanessa Cassidy, the popular schoolgirl bully of Tokyo International High School * Misako Uno as Miyuki Nazawa, Vanessa's best friend and lap dog * Matthew Knight as Jake Kimble, a young boy who suspects something happening in their apartment * Sarah Roemer as Lacey Kimble, a cheerleader and Jake's kind and supporting older sister * Jennifer Beals as Trish Kimble, Bill's new wife * Christopher Cousins as Bill Kimble, Jake and Lacey's father * Jenna Dewan as Sally, Lacey's neighbor and best friend * Eve Gordon as Principal Dale, Tokyo International High School's counselor * Ohga Tanaka and Yuya Ozeki (archive footage) as Toshio Saeki, Kayako and Takeo's 7-year-old son * Takashi Matsuyama as Takeo Saeki, Kayako's husband who becomes angry after seeing that she has feelings for another man * Joanna Cassidy as Mrs. Davis, Karen and Aubrey's sick mother who lives in Pasadena, California USA. * Shaun Sipos as Michael, Miyuki's boyfriend * Jason Behr as Doug, Karen's boyfriend (in photographs) * Kim Miyori as Nakagawa Kawamata, Kayako's mother and a Japanese itako * Ryo Ishibashi as Detective Nakagawa (in interview video) * Paul Jarrett as John Fleming, Allison's father * Gwenda Lorenzetti as Annie Fleming, Allison's mother ==Production== The Grudge 2 was announced three days after the release of The Grudge in 2004 and was officially fasttracked after a positive box office response with the film grossing $110,175,871. In early January 2005, Shimizu suggested ideas regarding the film's plot. Ideas included the origin of the curse and new character subplots. The film was later placed into development hell for almost a year until December 2005, when the first few cast members were announced (Sarah Michelle Gellar and Teresa Palmer) . Other production details were also revealed, including the original scheduled date for principal photography, which was due to begin January 30, 2006, but was postponed until February. Principal photography for The Grudge 2 was held at Toho Studios in Tokyo, Japan and production wrapped up on April 25, 2006. During an interview on Dread Central with Amber Tamblyn, it was reported that sets were created in Chicago for Tamblyn to re-shoot several scenes. Shimizu said in an interview with Sci Fi Wire, \\"For The Grudge 2, I was going for this mystery that was never there in The Grudge and I think that's going to fulfill the audience. ... There's a secret about Kayako's childhood life, so that's part of the big mystery. And the other mystery is this grudge will never stop and it's going to ... spread. And how is it going to get spread? That's another mystery.\\" He also clarified that \\"The Grudge was a complete remake of Ju-on, meaning the storyline was very similar. Basically, it's the same. But Grudge 2 is actually different from Ju-on: The Grudge 2 and I don't think I would have accepted this job if it was going to be the same storyline. And because it was a different story, you know, my motivation was a bit higher and I actually enjoy doing this.\\" ==Release== Shimizu and Tamblyn cutting the ribbon at the premiere of The Grudge 2. The Grudge 2 premiered at Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, California on October 8, 2006. During the premiere, the theme park was open to the public and featured a Grudge 2 maze as part of its 2006 Halloween Haunt. ===Marketing=== Sony employed various methods to promote The Grudge 2. On April 1, 2006, a teaser site was launched with details revealing the October 13 release date. Many forum sites such as IMDb were swamped with claims that Sony was playing an April Fool's joke. A few days later, the site's authenticity was proven and claims that it was a hoax were dismissed. On September 10, 2006, Sony released a missing persons file on its official blog stating a student filmmaker known as \\"Jason C\\" (Jason Cutler) disappeared a few weeks after visiting the set of the film. The blog originally broadcast interviews with the film's stars including Tamblyn, Gellar and Jenna Dewan but had been taken over by his roommate who filed the report. On September 19, 2006, Yahoo! Movies was the first site to release three short films titled Tales from the Grudge with an introduction from one of the producers of The Grudge, Sam Raimi. The series of shorts expands on the story of the Saeki curse. The shorts also appear on the film's official site Sony Pictures Entertainment; fans who volunteered their mobile phone number received surprise calls from Kayako or Toshio. The films also became available on other film and horror-related websites as part of a wide-reaching and unique digital marketing strategy. The shorts were directed by Toby Wilkins (director of The Grudge 3) and written by Ben Ketai. * Part 1, \\"Hotel\\": The first in the series of shorts. It introduces Ross (played by Daniel Sykes) as he wakes up in a Tokyo hotel room and coughs up quantities of Kayako's black hair. He wakes from this nightmare to the sound of the mobile phone and answers it. The caller is his girlfriend Abby (played by Stefanie Butler), who is safe at home. Ross explains that his attempts to investigate the house and the woman with long black hair have led to a dead end. When the phone call ends, we stay with Ross as he takes a photo of himself with his mobile phone. He does not notice as Kayako passes by behind him at the precise moment he takes the shot. He then sends the picture to Abby. Ross then goes to brush his teeth and finds black hair in his toothbrush before being grabbed through the mirror by Kayako. * Part 2, \\"School\\": The second short film in which we follow the story of Abby as she ends the phone call from the first short. Abby then proceeds to call her friend Brooke (played by Ginny Weirick) to ask about plans that evening. When the call ends, Abby receives a photo message from her boyfriend Ross (from the first short). When Abby looks closer at the image, she sees that Kayako is in the hotel room with Ross. Abby attempts to call her boyfriend and warn him, but she only hears Kayako and then it hangs up. Abby looks over at the girl that was sitting beside her to see Kayako. * Part 3, \\"House\\": The third short film that overlaps during the events in \\"School.\\" The film opens with Brooke (as introduced in the second short) receiving a phone call from Abby. As the call ends, Brooke agrees to play hide and seek with the child, Josh, whom she is babysitting and chooses a walk-in closet as her hiding place. Brooke soon finds herself trapped and is dragged violently into the underworld by Kayako. Josh then gets up and says \\"Come out, come out, wherever you are,\\" before Brooke's cell phone begins ringing. ===Home media=== The Grudge 2 was released on DVD and UMD video for the PlayStation Portable on February 6, 2007. Both are available in a rated and unrated director's cut format. The unrated format is 6 minutes longer than the rated version, clocking in at 108 minutes as opposed to the theatrical cut which is 102 minutes. Both DVD formats include the following extras: *Tales from the Grudge webisodes (Region 1 only) *Cast and crew reel change montage *Four featurettes: **Holding a Grudge: Kayako & Toshio **East Meets West **Grudge 2 Storyline Development **Ready When You Are Mr Shimizu *Deleted scenes The movie was also made available on iTunes in October 2008. A Blu-ray Disc version of the film has yet to be released in the United States, having only received a Blu-ray in France which is Region Locked, and a Blu-ray in Holland that is Region Free but missing the extras. Both contain the Unrated Cut. ====Sales==== The DVD sold $5,233,327 in its first week, much lower than the previous film's $9 million. In its second week of retail availability it sold a further $3,060,351 for a total of $8,293,678 within two weeks. It is estimated to have earned at least $15 million from home media sales since, bringing the film's total gross to $85 million. ==Reception== ===Box office=== The film opened in 3,211 theaters and was expected to generate $27 million across the October 13–15 weekend but generated $10,018,039 on its opening day and $20.8 million on its opening weekend. It placed number one at the box office, beating out The Departed. The film showed poor staying power and earned $39.1 million in North America, making it the first ever film to open over $20 million yet gross less than 50% of its earnings after opening weekend. It also easily set the record for lowest gross of a $20 million opener. It earned an additional $30 million internationally. The movie made $70 million worldwide. ===Critical response=== The film was one of three films not shown to critics on the release date (the other two being The Marine and One Night with the King). It received notably worse reviews from critics than its predecessor, with an approval rating of 11% on Rotten Tomatoes (76 reviews) compared to The Grudges 39%. Metacritic gave the film a score of 33/100 based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". The film was criticized by several critics for its confusing plot. Keith Phipps from The A.V. Club wrote, \\"While The Grudge 2 deserves some credit for creating and sustaining a creepy atmosphere, it doesn't matter much when the plot doesn't go anywhere.\\" Pete Vonder Haar from Film Threat found \\"[t]he same problems that plagued the original are on display here. Most notably, the lack of any coherent plot.\\" Paul Debrudge from Variety stated, \\"The story is incidental, as auds merely anticipate the scares.\\" Tim Goernert from Joblo \\"found it really hard to follow the story as well, as there were three of them happening at the same time.\\" The film has also been criticized as being eye candy. Terry Lawson from the Detroit Free Press judged, \\"The Grudge 2 is just a mélange of images, some mildly disturbing, but mostly just variations on a theme.\\" ==References(archive) ** Production notes at Sci-Fi Japan * * * The Grudge 2 Reviews at Metacritic.com * *Review at Dread Central Category:2006 films Category:2000s psychological horror films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Takashi Shimizu Category:Foreign films shot in Japan Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Ghost House Pictures films Category:American haunted house films Category:Japanese-language films Category:American sequel films Category:Japan in fiction Category:American nonlinear narrative films Category:Horror films featuring female antagonists Category:Films produced by Sam Raimi Category:Films scored by Christopher Young Category:Films set in 2004 Category:Films set in 2006 Category:Films set in Chicago Category:Films set in California Category:Films set in Tokyo Category:American ghost films Category:2000s supernatural horror films Category:American psychological horror films Category:Films with screenplays by Stephen Susco Category:Asian- American horror films Category:The Grudge (franchise) films Category:Japan in non-Japanese culture ","title":"The Grudge 2"},{"id":"3226775","text":"View toward Beesby Grange Mill House Farm near Saleby Beesby with Saleby is a civil parish in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England.

They live under the waters of Lyme Bay, Dorset, United Kingdom, where they contribute to the world-famous Chesil Beach, which extends from West-Bay to Portland Harbour. The beach forms part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. A particular feature of the beach is the unusual natural phenomenon, pertaining to the carefully graded size of the pebbles from which it is composed. These pebbles are no bigger than shingle at the West Bay end, and gradually increase in size to that of a baked-potato, at its Southernmost end, on the Isle of Portland. This grading is commonly attributed to longshore drift, but is in fact a result of the diligent labours of the Pippos. Living in \\"pods\\" of three or more, along its length, they work nocturnally to grade the pebbles, and thus maintain the integrity of the beach. Without their efforts there would most certainly be extensive flooding through the beach, leading to the Isle of Portland being cut off from the mainland. == Reception == The book was distributed \\"among every nursery, infant and primary school\\" in Devon according to Dorset Echo.

He was born in Levin, New Zealand, and served as a photojournalist for Life for 30 years. Silk's career as a war photographer began in 1939, when he was a combat cameraman for the Australian government, covering action in the Middle East, North Africa and Greece. Trapped with the famed Desert Rats at Tobruk in Libya, he was captured by German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's forces but escaped 10 days later. He began working for Life magazine in 1943. Silk photographed many important events during World War II. He covered the war on the Italian front, the Allied invasions of France and the Pacific. In New Guinea, Silk walked 300 miles with the Allied forces, an ordeal later described in the book War in New Guinea. He was with U.S. forces in the Battle of the Bulge in 1944 and was wounded by a grenade during a river crossing in Germany. His co-worker Will Lang Jr. reported on the Battle of the Bulge and the river crossing. Silk took the first photographs of Nagasaki, Japan, after the atomic bomb was dropped there on August 9, 1945, as well as Japanese war criminals awaiting trial in postwar Tokyo. He became a U.S. citizen in 1947. Edward Steichen included his pictures taken in Jamaica in the 1955 Museum of Modern Art exhibition The Family of Man which toured the world to be seen by 9 million visitors. In December 1972, Silk was in Nepal, shooting an assignment on Himalayan game parks, when he received news that the magazine had folded. According to the 1977 book That Was the Life, he replied by saying, \\"Your message . . . badly garbled.

It drains the western portion of Orange County and the southern half of Durham County and flows into the northern end of Jordan Lake reservoir. The drainage area encompasses urban, suburban and rural lands. Formerly the New Hope River, it was a tributary of the Cape Fear River until it was dammed to create Jordan Lake. Construction of the lake began in 1973, after a comprehensive study of regional water management by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, motivated by major flooding in a 1945 hurricane. Several communities draw drinking water from Jordan Lake, increasing interest in protection of the New Hope Creek watershed. Since the late 1980s, local environmentalists have tried to protect a 20-mile corridor along New Hope Creek for conservation and recreational use. A comprehensive plan for the corridor was approved in 1992 by the City of Durham, Durham County, Orange County and the town of Chapel Hill. Since that time, approximately $3 million has been spent on land acquisition in the corridor and several miles of public trails have been constructed. ==Ecology== The creek is home to many species of fish, including but not limited to: Largemouth bass, bluegill, green sunfish, golden shiner, black crappie, white perch, bowfin, white catfish, brown bullhead, flat bullhead, channel catfish, threadfin shad and notchlip redhorse. ==References== ==External links== * New Hope Creek Corridor Advisory Committee Category:Rivers of North Carolina Category:Bodies of water of Orange County, North Carolina Category:Rivers of Durham County, North Carolina ","title":"New Hope Creek"},{"id":"3226850","text":"The Yugoslavia national under-21 football team existed in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

The EP's single, \\"New York City\\" released on Ready Records, was the band's breakthrough hit on CFNY in 1979. Brent left the band and went on to form the post punk/new wave band, \\"Mettle\\" as guitarist and synth player. Brent was replaced by Steve Koch in the Demics. The band released a self-titled full-length album in 1980, but subsequently broke up due to internal tensions. In 1996, a new CD compiling both of the band's original albums titled New York City was released domestically on Huge Records. Also that year, \\"New York City\\" was named the greatest Canadian song of all time in a reader poll by the music magazine Chart. Vocalist Keith Whittaker died of cancer 16 July 1996. Bullseye Records of Canada released singer Keith Whittaker's final recordings on a twelve-song CD called Drink To Me in August 2007. Guitarist Rob Brent died of a heart condition 5 November 2014 at the age of 57. ==Discography== *1979: Talk's Cheap *1980: Demics *1996: New York City *2007: Drink To Me by Keith Whittaker ==See also== *Music of Canada *Canadian punk rock *List of bands from Canada ==References== ==External links== * Keith Whittaker solo album at Bullseye Records * Keith Whittaker at MySpace Category:Canadian punk rock groups Category:Musical groups from Toronto Category:Musical groups established in 1977 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1980 Category:1996 in Canadian music Category:1977 establishments in Ontario Category:1980 disestablishments in Ontario ","title":"The Demics"},{"id":"3226859","text":"Dachigam National Park is located 22 kilometers from Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir.

The variation in altitude is vast, ranging from 5500 ft to 14000 ft above mean sea level. Due to this vast variation, the park is demarcated into an uneven region. The terrain ranges from gently sloping grasslands to sharp rocky outcrops and cliffs. 321 == Flora == The mountain sides below the tree line are wooded. Most of this coniferous forest consists of broad leaf species. Interspersed between these are alpine pastures, meadows, waterfalls and scrub vegetation with deep gullies, locally known as Nars, running down the mountain face.

It took place during 2004 and 2005. This process was originated by a land owner who sued the Federal District's government on the grounds of improper expropriation of a patch of land called El Encino. This case became a serious issue for López Obrador in 2005, when a vote by the Chamber of Deputies lifted his constitutional immunity against criminal charges. If officially charged, he would have lost all his civil rights, including the right to run for the presidency in 2006, unless he was either quickly acquitted of all charges or managed to serve his sentence before the electoral registration deadline. The desafuero was supported by the then- ruling PAN, the federal government headed by then-President Vicente Fox, and the PRI; it was opposed by the PRD (the party in which López Obrador was affiliated) and left-wing politicians. The process lasted for more than a year and resulted in a polarization among Mexican society between those who supported the desafuero and those who opposed it. After a massive rally in support of López Obrador took place in Mexico City on April 24, 2005, with an attendance exceeding one million people (at the time, the biggest political demonstration in recent Mexican history)[http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/04/25/index.php La Jornada > Lunes 25 de abril de 2005], and near unanimous condemnation from the foreign media towards the process, Fox decided to stop the judicial process against López Obrador. On April 27, 2005, Fox announced changes in his cabinet, a re- evaluation of the legal case against AMLO and legal changes so civil rights are only suspended once a citizen is found guilty. Fox and López Obrador met in the first week of May 2005, as part of the efforts to calm the political climate. The new Attorney General found a way to avoid prosecuting López Obrador, but it depended on the approval of the private company that first sued him. ==Legal background== The 111th article of the Mexican Constitution states that most high-level elected officials cannot be prosecuted for criminal offenses while in office without a simple majority vote of the Chamber of Deputies stating there are grounds for prosecution. This privilege is usually confused with the freedom of speech protection granted to members of congress by the 61st article, known as fuero (from Latin forum), the process to strip it is known as desafuero. Since immunity from criminal prosecution is almost universally confused with the fuero, both terms will be used interchangeably. If the Chamber of Deputies votes in the negative, the prosecution can still take place when the official leaves his post, as deputies don't vote on the accusation itself but only on whether there is a reasonable belief that a crime was committed. If it votes in favor, the official can be prosecuted. A secondary law states in this case the official loses his office immediately. The constitution mandates that state governors are subject to their state congresses; the Federal District is not a state. An individual facing criminal prosecution has his political rights suspended (38th article) so he cannot run for office or hold one, at least temporarily. All candidates for the presidential election in July 2006 were required to register no later than January 15, 2006, although the law does allow a change of candidate until May of the same year. The legal system is mostly untested in cases like this, and the special status of the Federal District (it is not a state; until recently it was governed by a departmental head appointed by the president; it has a legislative assembly that is not a state congress) will lead to appeals and legal controversies before the Supreme Court. ==El Encino case== López Obrador ran exactly that risk. On November 9, 2000, Rosario Robles, his predecessor, expropriated a patch of land from a larger property called \\"El Encino\\", in Santa Fe, Cuajimalpa, to build an access road for a private hospital. The owner sued the government on March 11, 2001, and was granted a federal judicial order barring further construction until the matter was definitively settled, as it prevented the owner access to his own property. By August, the judge found the works continued, so he requested the federal attorney general to make an inquiry and take the necessary steps to bring him into compliance. The federal attorney general had no option but to proceed. Several months passed, partly because until recent times the courts usually sided with the government in expropriation cases and therefore the case covers unknown ground, and partly because it was such an extraordinary step. By May 17, 2004, the attorney general could not keep procrastinating (otherwise he would be prosecuted) and announced he would request the removal of AMLO's immunity, which he did two days later. Many months of mutual accusations later, it became clear 2005 would be a pivotal year for the case. He would be formally prosecuted in a matter of days after losing his immunity; in that case he would have had to be cleared of all charges before January 15, 2006 if he wished to run for the presidency (although the law allows candidate changes until May). López Obrador stated several times he would forgo all legal means available to him to remain free until a verdict is given, going to prison when the prosecution starts and campaigning from there. He also stated he would be his own lawyer at his criminal trial (his studies are in political science and public administration) although he would receive legal advice from two different lawyers. His party changed its statutes to allow him to become a candidate while jailed. As part of his campaign before the Chamber of Deputies' vote, he organized mass rallies in public places to pressure the vote in his favor and doing media interviews comparing his process with those held against Mexican revolutionary Francisco I. Madero or U.S. civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., insisting it was a conspiracy masterminded by former President Salinas and President Fox. A fact that was lost despite having appeared earlier in official documents was that, apparently, López Obrador refused to follow the judicial order barring further construction of accesses to the ABC Hospital because he was sued by them and would have to pay USD 37 million if the accesses weren't finished before the deadline. Apparently, his government sold land to construct the hospital but for some reason, in agreement with the hospital, such land was exchanged for another. The new land had no accesses, making it useless; the hospital sued AMLO's government. It is unknown at this moment if AMLO's government committed a financial offense in regard to this. ==The Chamber of Deputies vote== Despite his vigorous defense, the process could not be stopped and López Obrador lost the first battle in a restricted vote by a commission of four deputies on April 1, 2005, opening the door for the full Chamber of Deputies to vote six days later to remove his immunity after hearing both his and the prosecution's arguments. This restricted vote by the commission, originally scheduled two days earlier, decided there was a reasonable belief a crime was committed by three votes to one. Media coverage of the preliminary vote was small, because of the impending demise of Pope John Paul II (he died the next day). This prompted López Obrador to express (hours before the Pope died) his concerns about what he saw as minimal coverage of his desafuero process, but \\"hours and hours\\" of special coverage on the Pope's health condition. \\"(The media only said that) López Obrador lost three to one, as if it were a soccer match\\", he said, expressing his fears of a return to a time when the media, especially television, were subordinated to the government. On April 7, 2005 López Obrador went to the Chamber of Deputies to present his case. Attendance, when the session began, was reported to be 488 out of 500 deputies, but apparently one of the deputies arrived too late to vote. After a long session where AMLO accused President Fox of being behind the process, the Chamber of Deputies voted by 360 to 127 (with two abstentions) to lift AMLO's constitutional immunity against prosecution. A secondary law states that in cases like this, he is immediately dismissed from his office. The local assembly of representatives (the Federal District has no Congress as its status is somewhere between a state and a county), with a majority of PRD members (AMLO's party) has refused to acknowledge the validity of this process. This will be relevant to the city's future, as they are the ones legally entitled to name AMLO's successor. ==Political context== The desafuero is both a legal and a political process (it is the Chamber of Deputies, an eminently political body, that decides the outcome) and as such, political considerations played at least as great a role as legal considerations in deciding López Obrador's fate. There were political reactions both against and in favour of the process from early 2004, climaxing in April 2005 when López Obrador saw his constitutional immunity lifted. * General political context The desafuero process started and gathered momentum during the second half of the Vicente Fox presidency, characterised by a growing sense of power vacuum as Fox was increasingly perceived by Mexican society and political actors as a \\"lame duck\\" incapable of pushing the ambitious reform agenda that swept him into power in 2000. The Fox presidency was also besieged by cabinet defections and the growing popularity of López Obrador, who was running significantly ahead of all other likely candidates in all presidential election polls and seemed to be immune to political scandals involving his inner circle. * Political and social reactions in favor of the desafuero The political case for the desafuero was championed mainly by the federal government, the governing Partido Acción Nacional (PAN) and the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI). On its face, their main argument was the full enforcement of the law. This argument resonated with many sectors of society long accustomed to suffer the selective enforcement of the law according to political or economic considerations. To others, however, this argument rang hollow in view of the lack of prosecution of several multimillion-dollar financial scandals involving prominent members of the PRI and, to a lesser extent, the PAN. Towards the end of the desafuero process, amid increasing perception of its politicization, this argument became less tenable, with support for the desafuero ultimately coming almost exclusively from militants of the PRI and PAN. * Political actors and reactions against the desafuero Predictably, arguments against the desafuero came, at least at the start, from López Obrador's Partido de la Revolución Democrática (PRD) and other members and militants of the Mexican political left. By early 2005 AMLO promoted different forms of protest against the desafuero: posters declaring \\"No al desafuero\\" or similar slogans, seen mostly in March, making a census of political and grassroots movements willing to show their support for López Obrador, different political acts by his party, the PRD. López Obrador's media strategy was to contrast his prosecution with that of killings attributed to previous governments (1968, 1971) and financial scandals (1994-1995) where almost no convictions were made (but heavy fines applied in some of the latter), and emphasizing his status as the leader in the polls. He also compared himself with Francisco I. Madero, a political candidate in 1910 who was imprisoned by dictator Porfirio Díaz and eventually became leader of the Mexican Revolution and the next president. He also has compared himself with international civil rights activists who suffered prison at some moment of their life. He also claims his process to be a political plot orchestrated by, among other top politicians, former president Carlos Salinas de Gortari, former President Fox, and PAN presidential pre-candidate Santiago Creel. As the desafuero process gained momentum, more independent voices began to express their opposition to it. This included noted Mexican intellectuals, much of the national media, some members of the PRI and the PAN and ultimately, a unanimous chorus from the foreign media. This was the main factor that ultimately forced the PAN and the government to reverse their course on this matter and to look for a political solution. This outcome was widely hailed as a positive for Mexican society and democracy, but it clearly took a heavy toll on the government's credibility. Many also argue that the Rule of Law principle that the PAN and the government had so vehemently defended during the process was suddenly no longer a priority when it became clear that the politics of the desafuero were only damaging the PAN's prospects and were arguably boosting López Obrador's political image. ==Chronology== *9 November 2000: Rosario Robles, his predecessor, expropriated a plot of land from a larger property called El Encino, in Santa Fe, Cuajimalpa, to build an access road for a private hospital. *11 March 2001: The landowner sued the Federal District on the grounds of improper expropriation. He was granted a federal judicial order barring further construction until the matter was definitively settled. Construction, the proprietor alleged, prevented access to his property. According to prosecutors, López Obrador knowingly disregarded this order several times. Under the criminal code, this is a misdemeanor. *January 2005: López Obrador's intention to run for President became clear. Meanwhile, the Attorney General resurrects the case and sends it to Congress for evaluation. * Late February and March 2005: As the desafuero vote in a congressional sub- committee approached, the federal government initiated a media campaign against López Obrador. Fox had his Secretary of the Interior, Santiago Creel, run a series of media spots which attempted to draw comparisons between López Obrador and common criminals.Grupo civil fantasma patrocina onerosa campaña televisiva contra López Obrador Despite the media campaign, the overwhelming majority of the population believed that the desafuero process was politically motivated. * 1 April 2005: López Obrador lost the first battle in a vote taken by a sub-committee of four deputies, enabling a desafuero vote by the full Chamber of Deputies six days later. * 7 April 2005: López Obrador defended himself in an address to the deputies. After a long session in which he accused President Fox of being behind the process, the Chamber of Deputies voted to remove the fuero 360 to 127. The final tally amounted to a party-line vote, with the PRI and the PAN voting to remove his fuero. The PRD, López Obrador's party, voted unanimously against the resolution. López Obrador saw his constitutional immunities lifted. The loss of his constitutional immunity appeared to be the beginning of a protracted legal and political struggle that would expose certain shortcomings in the Mexican legal system. After the deputies' vote, the Asamblea Legislativa del Distrito Federal (the local legislative body) precipitated a constitutional crisis, claiming it was that body which should have voted on the desafuero; the federal deputies' filed their own complaint, arguing that Congress was the appropriate body to consider the desafuero. The Supreme Court agreed to consider both appeals, thereby allowing López Obrador to remain Head of Government, while simultaneously being subject to prosecution. Editorials in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, and the Financial Times all considered the desafuero a bad decision. * 8 April 2005: López Obrador left office. The local government was temporarily headed by López Obrador's Secretary of Government Alejandro Encinas. * Two local deputies from the PAN, Jorge Lara and Gabriela Cuevas,Ironiza Döring sobre fianza de AMLO (In Spanish) the ruling party, paid the bail so López Obrador would not be incarcerated. López Obrador called the bail a \\"cowardly act\\" and refused to accept it as it came from the hands of those that promoted the desafuero. A judge later rejected the charges and the bail on technical grounds. *24 April 2005: A rally in support of López Obrador takes place at the Zócalo in Mexico City. Mexico City sources cited an attendance exceeding one million people.La Jornada > Lunes 25 de abril de 2005 Federal government sources calculated an attendance in the \\"hundreds of thousands\\". López Obrador had promoted different forms of protest against the desafuero as early as the case against him started. His critics charged that this promotion was paid for with government funds. This included the production of posters featuring phrases such as \\"No al desafuero\\" or \\"No al Golpe de Estado\\". He also coordinated political and grassroots movements in Mexico and abroad. His supporters countered that the promotion was spontaneous, and completely independent of the local government. *27 April 2005: President Fox announced changes in his cabinet (including the resignation of Attorney General Rafael Macedo de la Concha) and a re-evaluation of the legal case against López Obrador, and he proposed a constitutional amendment so civil rights are not suspended until a citizen is found guilty. As of February 2006, these changes have not passed Congress. A new attorney general was appointed. *4 May 2005: The new Attorney General's office announced they would drop contempt charges against López Obrador on a technicality. In summary, it declared, he was guilty but his unique post as \\"Head of Government\\", of recent creation, had not been incorporated in all the laws. The law only had provisions for governors or municipal president). López Obrador was neither. Hence, the wording of the relevant article made it unclear if a penalty for his crime exists. The announcement was refuted by criminal law experts. On the one hand, they contended, because there is a clear penalty due legal precedents. On the other hand, they claimed, the Attorney General cannot declare guilt nor innocence, even less interpret the law. Thereby, the Attorney General could not drop charges due to the nature of the offense and because charges were filed by a private company. The company followed the suit. *December 2005: Chief Justice Mariano Azuela Güitrón further criticized the case dismissal. He said that neither the President nor Congress can declare innocence nor close the matter for political reasons, as he claimed Fox did. (According to published reports, Chief Justice Mariano Azuela had discussed the desafuero of López Obrador with President Fox as early as late 2004, well before Congress took action, a highly irregular act.) * January 2006: Marisela Morales, the Attorney General's official directly in charge of the case since the beginning, left her post at the unit responsible for prosecuting crimes committed by government officials. With her departure, all high-level officials in charge of the case have been replaced, but the Attorney General's office did state, shortly after Azuela's speech in late December, that charges against López Obrador are still pending. ==The aftermath== The loss of his constitutional immunity appeared to be only the beginning of a long legal and political struggle. Aside from the political power at risk, the untested legal system has shown deficiencies which will further prolong controversies. After the deputies' vote, the Asamblea Legislativa del Distrito Federal rose a constitutional controversy against them claiming it was they who should have voted since they are similar to a state Congress. (The Federal District is not a state.) The federal deputies' filed their own complaint, and both were accepted by the Supreme Court. Both were in effect simultaneously, so AMLO was and was not the Head of Government. When a judge knew about the charges, two local deputies of the PAN ruling party paid a guarantee to keep AMLO away from jail. The judge rejected later both the charges and the guarantee on technical grounds. AMLO called the guarantee a \\"cowardly act\\", as he wanted to be imprisoned. On April 24, 2005 a march called by AMLO was attended by an official estimate of 1.2 million people (as estimated by the Federal District government's Secretary of Public Security). This figure includes union and government workers. The march culminated on the Zócalo, in the center of the city, participants either expressing their solidarity towards López Obrador or their disapproval of the desafuero process. This was probably the most widely attended political event in recent times, and comparable to the apolitical march against crime held two years before. On April 27 President Fox announced changes to his cabinet, a reevaluation of the legal case against AMLO and legal changes so civil rights are only suspended until a citizen is found guilty. In his eight-minute speech to the nation, he called AMLO \\"Head of Government\\", forgetting controversies about whether he was sacked from office or not, and placed great emphasis on the importance of having suspicion-free elections in 2006. This was an important victory for AMLO, but it was still too early to say the case was closed. On May 4 the Attorney General's office announced they would drop contempt charges against AMLO on a technicality: they declared he was guilty but his unique post as Head of Government (neither governor nor mayor) makes it unclear a penalty for his crime exists due to the wording of the relevant article. This announcement was refuted by criminal law experts, since the Attorney General cannot declare guilt or innocence, even less interpret the law; they cannot drop charges due to the nature of the offense and because charges were pressed by a private company, which has stated will follow the suit. Even if López Obrador can't be punished for a technicality (a controversial issue in itself) he could still be found guilty and subject to other penalties. Even more, under current law, López Obrador would be prevented from running for office for as long as he is subject to process, and since the moment he resigned to run for the presidency he is a common citizen which could be subject to process at any moment, then losing his political rights. It is unlikely this would happen, for political reasons, despite the efforts of the private owner suing him. ==References== Category:2004 in Mexico Category:2004 in Mexican politics Category:2005 in Mexico Category:2005 in Mexican politics Category:Modern Mexico Category:Political scandals in Mexico Category:Vicente Fox Category:Legal history of Mexico Category:Legal immunity ","title":"Desafuero of Andrés Manuel López Obrador"},{"id":"3226917","text":"The term coastie or coasty (more often heard and seen as the plural coasties) is a pejorative term used in Midwestern U.S. universities (especially the University of Wisconsin-Madison) to denote students who come from outside the region, mainly from the East or West coast. == Background == The term is thought to have been coined in the early to mid-1990s.

Mammals present include Asian elephant, gaur, Sambar deer, clouded leopard, Indian leopard. ==History== Buxa Fort Buxa Tiger Reserve The historic Buxa Fort ( above m.s.l.). People have sentimental attachment with the fort on accounts of its association with the struggle for freedom. A sacred temple, Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga lies in BTR. Around 10,000 devotees of Lord Shiva congregate here on \\"Shiva Chouturdoshi\\". Buxa Tiger Reserve was created in 1983 as the 15th tiger reserve in India. In 1986, Buxa Wildlife Sanctuary was constituted over 314.52 km2 of the reserve forests. In 1991, 54.47 km2 was added to Buxa Wildlife Sanctuary. A year later, in 1992, the Government of West Bengal declared its intentions to constitute a national park over 117.10 km2 of the Buxa Wildlife Sanctuary. State government finally declared national park with notification No.3403-For/11B-6/95 dt. 05.12.1997. ==Geography== ===Location=== Jayanti hills Buxa Tiger Reserve lies in Alipurduar district of West Bengal. Its northern boundary runs along the international border with Bhutan. The Sinchula hill range lies all along the northern side of BTR and the eastern boundary touches that of the Assam state. National Highway No.31 C roughly runs along its southern boundary. It is the easternmost extension of extreme bio-diverse North-East India and represents highly endemic Indo- Malayan region. The fragile \\"Terai Eco-System\\" constitutes a part of this reserve. The Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary of Bhutan is contiguous to the north of BTR. Manas National Park lies on east of BTR. BTR, thus, serves as international corridor for Asian elephant migration between India and Bhutan. To the south-west, the Chilapata Forests form an elephant corridor to the Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary. The reserve encompasses as many as eight forest types. The divisional headquarters is located at Alipurduar. The forest is divided into two divisions: East and West. Buxa Fort is an important landmark for this reserve. This fort was captured by British-India in 1865 after the Bhutan War from Bhutan. Later this fort was used as a detention camp for Indian freedom fighters during the Indian freedom movement. ===Geology=== It is contiguous to the Buxa Formation of Mamley in Mamley village of Namchi neighboring state of Sikkim, the stromatolite bearing Dolomite Limestones, which has been declared national geological monument by the Geological Survey of India (GSI), for their protection, maintenance, promotion and enhancement of geotourism.national geo-heritage of India, INTACH == Biodiversity == ===Flora=== More than 450 species of trees, 250 species of shrubs, 400 species of herbs, 9 species of cane, 10 species of bamboo, 150 species of orchids, 100 species of grass and 130 species of aquatic flora including more than 70 sedges (Cyperaceae) have been identified so far. There are more than 160 species of other monocotyledons and ferns. The main trees are sal, champa, gamhar, simul and chikrasi.

They are the ancient ethnic group among the other inhabitants of Buxa Tiger Reserve. Dukpas used live in the hamlets of Buxa Hills from east to west. The seasonal migratory Dukpas are divided mainly into 30 different sects. They originally were the followers of (Drukpa Kagyud) Mahayani Buddhism. Some of them are converted into Christianity. ===Trekking=== Buxa (2,600 ft) is a one-hour, fifteen-minute (3.9 km) trek through picturesque surroundings from Santalabari, the starting point. The historical Buxa Fort was coming under the British India after the 2nd Dooars War (1865) between the Bhutan and the British, the subsidiary alliance of princely state Cooch Behar. This was used as a detention camp by the British, because of its remoteness during the Indian freedom movement. Many freedom fighters were imprisoned here. After independence, it served as a refugee camp for Tibetans and Bangladeshis. There are a number of trekking routes through the jungle. *There is a 4 km further trek to Rovers' Point or Romitey Dara (the land of beautiful birds at ). *From Buxa, one can also take the 13 km trek route for Jayanti via Mahakal Cave through the dense jungle (subjected to get permission from BTR). The Mahakal Cave is a stalactite-stalagmite cave, popularly known as the Mahakal cave near Jainty.http://www.cpreecenvis.nic.in/Database/MahakalCave_3080.aspx *The most popular route is Pagsamkha Path Trek route, which starts from Buxa Fort, Buxaduar via Aadma and ends at Raimatung. An expert guide and entry permit are must for trekking in Buxa hills. One may visit the very beautiful village of Dukpas called Lapchakha (1.5 hour trek) from Buxa Fort. A beautiful trekkers' hut named Dukpa's Hut (with attached bath) is located just opposite to the Buxa Fort ground and besides of Rupang Valley Trek route. Though there are eight home stays in total, but mostly are located at Lapchakha with minimum facilities. Only Rovers' Inn at Sadar bazar have maximum capacity of accommodations but far from Buxa Fort. Dukpas Hut is also called 'Birders Nest' by the bird watchers. Trekking in different short route with camping facilities arranged from the Dukpas Hut. It has a separate kitchen for trekkers also. the double storied wooden hut has two family rooms (sleeping 3) on upper floor and a dormitory with attached bath on ground floor (sleeping 6) with dining facility. Bird watching, trekking and dark sky photography tours also arrange from here. The hut became an important centre for the promotion of tourism in this region. Wongyel and Chhogyel Dukpa are the two Dukpa brothers are to run the home stay and assist the trekkers here. The Baksha Duar Post Office is a heritage building and the highest post office in Alipurduar District. The tribe Dukpas (Indo-Bhutanese) lived in eleven hamlets of Buxa Hills which mostly located in hilly jungles of Buxa Tiger Reserve at altitude ranging from 2400–6200 feet. Another entry point Rajabhatkhawa (17 km from Alipurduar) has an orchidarium, and a nature interpretation centre. One can go for a circular trek from Buxaduar via Chunabhati-Adma to Raimatang. This is actually 8 hours tough trek with an expert guide but usually trekkers prefer to make it as a 3-day comfortable trek to understand nature and the ethnic culture of this region. Pukri Mai is a small sacred pond inside the park where fishes like magur and singi and turtles are kept. Festivals are held at certain time of the year by both Buddhist and Hindus and local ethnic groups like Dukpas. ==Issues== * Most rivers enter Buxa Tiger Reserve from Bhutan and carry huge amount of bed load obliterating beds of rivers in the reserve. Flooding is frequent. Critical habitats are lost. * More than 100,000 cattle graze in the reserve daily. Weeds, unpalatable grasses and shrubs have invaded the overgrazed areas. * Hilly, Bhabhar and riverine tracts of core suffer from fire. Generally non timber forest produce collectors and shepherds put forests on fire. * No frequent poaching cases. Tribal population in tea gardens poach small mammals during Holi festival illicitly as part of ritual hunting. * Bodo militants from Assam occasionally enter core. Timber thieves operate in the area. * Five forest hamlets in hilly tract viz. Adma, Chunabhati, Santrabari, Tobgaon and Tashigaon have some encroachments by way of unauthorised orange orchards. *Dolomite mining in nearby areas. *Poachers come from Assam frequently to poach Indian elephants. ==See also== * List of national parks of India ==References== ===Citations=== ===External links=== * Information about the Tiger Reserve * Travel information for Buxa National Park * Birds of Buxa Tiger Reserve * Butterflies of Buxa Tiger Reserve & Samsing * Flora of Buxa Tiger Reserve & Samsing * Birding trip report of Jayanti Buxa Category:Nature reserves Category:Tiger reserves of India Category:Dooars Category:Protected areas established in 1983 Category:National parks in West Bengal Category:Tourism in West Bengal Category:Alipurduar district ","title":"Buxa Tiger Reserve"},{"id":"3226943","text":"The rural district of Hallaton existed in Leicestershire, England from 1894 to 1935.

Its predecessor, a short News from Wales bulletin, started in 1957 and was originally presented by Michael Aspel. The new programme, originally presented by Brian Hoey, shared a 25-minute timeslot for regional news with Points West from Bristol - at the time, both programmes were broadcast to Wales and the West of England from the Wenvoe transmitter near Cardiff. By February 1964, two new television regions, BBC Wales and BBC West, had been created with the addition of a new channel (13) for Wales on Wenvoe. Wales Today thus became a 25-minute programme broadcast only to Wales while Points West was only broadcast to the West of England. In 1969, the opening of separate UHF transmitters at Wenvoe (Wales) and Mendip (West) led to complete separation, except for overlap areas in South Wales. Between September 1984 and September 1988, the programme aired at 5:35 pm - one hour earlier than most of its counterpart BBC news programmes elsewhere in the UK - before moving to the 6:30 pm timeslot in September 1988.

It is 123 meters deep and covers 19.5 ha ==History== Medieval town walls The settlement dates back to the beginnings of the Polish state. In the 12th century the Romanesque St. Godehard's Rotunda was built. The town was mentioned in the 13th and 14th centuries by its Old Polish name of Strelin. The name of the town derives from the Polish word strzała, meaning \\"arrow\\". The town's coat of arms is an example of canting, as it depicts an arrow, alluding to the town's name. It was granted town rights in 1292 by Duke Bolko I the Strict of the Piast dynasty, who also built defensive walls. Renaissance residence of the Piast dukes As a result of the fragmentation of Poland into smaller duchies, it became part of the Duchy of Legnica, remaining under rule of the Piasts until 1675. In the 15th century, the Hussites captured and plundered Strzelin three times. After that, in the 15th and 16th centuries the town flourished. The town's wealth came from clothmaking, shoemaking, tanning, brewing, metalworking. Strzelin was plundered many times by troops from various countries during the Thirty Years' War. In the 17th century Strzelin was located in a still predominantly Polish-speaking area.Borowicz D., Mapy narodowościowe Górnego Śląska od połowy XIX wieku do II Wojny Światowej, Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Wrocławskiego, Wrocław, 2004, p. 33 (in Polish) Strzelin was inhabited mainly by Poles and, as a result of immigration, by Germans and Jews. After the death of the last Piast duke George William in 1675, the town was incorporated into the Habsburg-ruled Bohemian (Czech) Kingdom and the period of religious tolerance ended. The town's self- government was limited and the tax pressure increased. In 1742 the town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. Afterwards the last remains of the town's autonomy were liquidated and a Germanisation action took place. During the Napoleonic Wars, in 1807 Polish-Italian troops marched through the town, and in 1815 also Russian troops. In the 19th century new factories were established: a brick factory in 1868, a sugar factory in 1871. In 1871, a railway line connecting Strzelin with regional capital Wrocław was opened. Soon the town gained railway connections with other cities in Lower Silesia. During World War II, the Germans brought thousands of prisoners of war to the town and the surrounding area: Poles, Frenchmen, Belgians, Russians, Englishmen and Yugoslavs. Near the end of the war, in January 1945, the German authorities displaced all the town's population. The German mayor of the town ordered to blow up the town hall tower and the tower of the Holy Cross church. On one of the town's squares, Germans hung six Polish workers, who were hiding in the abandoned town. It was severely damaged in the course of the Lower Silesian Offensive of the Red Army against the Wehrmacht in February 1945. In May 1945 Strzelin was handed over to the Polish administration.

Indiscriminate felling of the sholas started with the establishment of British settlements in Ootacamund, Coonoor and Wellington in the early 19th century. Beginning in 1841 authorities issued contracts to bidders to fell wood from specific sholas in a 'timber conservancy' program.

Eucalyptus became the preferred plantation tree. Unlike the others, the wattles spread by root suckers to quickly cover large areas of native grasslands, including the Mukurthi Hills, and was declared a pest \\"useful for covering wastelands.\\". Some black wattle plantations were maintained for the leather industry, as their bark yielded tannin. In 1882 Inspector General of Forests, Dietrich Brandis \\"recommended bringing the present of plantation up to to create enormous forest blocks \\"...which would make any remaining sholas redundant forest resources.\\" The entire area of MNP, was declared as a Reserve forest in 1886.Dogra, MNP Mgt plan, 3.6.1, Legal status In 1920 it was suggested that 10–15 acre plots in the Kundah Hills including the present park area, \\"be planted up each year in places where sholas have almost or quite disappeared, the most suitable species probably being Acacia dealbata (silver wattle)\\", thus replacing highly diverse endemic and stable ecosystems with an exotic monoculture supporting little animal diversity. The area was declared as a wildlife sanctuary on 3 August 1982 and upgraded to a National Park on 15 October 1990 in order to protect the Nilgiri tahr. ==Geography== Mukurthi National Park topographic map 1:250,000 Mukurthi National Park boundaries and features map Map of Nilgiris Biosphere Reserve, showing Mukurthi National Park in relation to multiple contiguous protected areas Mukurthi National Park has an elongated crescent shape facing to the west between 11°10' to 11°22' N and 76°26' to 76°34' E.

This cartoon is another short of the \\"Goofy the Everyman\\" series of the 1950s. This cartoon begins by tracing the brief history of smoking, including how Christopher Columbus brought tobacco to Europe from the Native Americans, and then moves on to Goofy, as \\"George Geef\\" in this cartoon, trying unsuccessfully to drop the smoking habit. This cartoon, because of its content, including depictions of a firing squad, was kept off of TV broadcasts. It was eventually included as one of the cartoons featured in A Salute to Father (later renamed Goofy's Salute to Father), a 1961 episode of the Walt Disney anthology series, but the ending was changed to include an extra announcement with Goofy announcing that he quits smoking for good. Finally, the short was included on DVD with the original ending, as part of the Walt Disney Treasures line. ==Plot== In this cartoon, we start with flashbacks featuring a \\"Goofy\\"-like version of Christopher Columbus, who is given a cigar by a Native American. His three ships bring it back to their country, with smoke floating from them. A man in Europe rolls a cigar with a leaf and a midget lights it with a small torch, and we see the impact of the popularity of smoking today. Then we fade to Goofy, in the role of George Geef, who is an extreme nicotine addict, smoking various cigarettes, cigars and pipes, as we watch him smoke during the evening and as he goes to bed (as a huge cloud of smoke covers his head), when he wakes up in the morning, as he shaves, as he drinks coffee and at work. But soon his throat tickles and his eyes get irritated and he cannot blow out his matches. So he throws away all of his smoking products and decides to quit. It works fine at first, and feels he can do it. But then the boss congratulates George for being able to quit smoking, and as he lights up a cigarette, he says \\"It ain't easy. If it was, I'd quit!\\" Another employee, who is now a father, nearly offers George a cigar in honor of the occasion, but then remembers that he quit smoking. Almost everyone at the office still smokes, and George admits that he loves smoking, and he babbles like crazy and runs out of the office like a madman, leading into the following montage... ===George's search for a smoke=== Throughout the rest of the cartoon, George is searching for a smoke, all the while yelling, \\"Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! Smoke!\\" Here is where he finds them, only to be unsuccessful in smoking it in some way or another: *He tries to go into a tobacco store, but it is now closed for lunch. He then swipes a cigar from the wooden Indian statue near the door. He is about to light it, but a voice (presumably the statue) calls out \\"Ugh!\\" and a well-thrown tomahawk splits the cigar in half. *He finds some tobacco from a man filling his pipe and a small piece of paper. He catches the tobacco in the paper and tries to roll it, but fails and gets it everywhere. *He tries to pick up a discarded cigar, but a foot steps on it, flattening it and gets his hand in the process, leaving an imprint on his hand that reads, \\"Pussyfoot\\". George yells in pain. *He picks up another cigar near an elevator doorway, but a voice calls out \\"Goin' up!\\" and the door closes on the cigar and as the elevator rises, so does the cigar. *He goes into a smoking room, but is kicked out because it is for women only. *He tries to get a discarded cigarette, but a hobo has grabbed it at the same time. The hobo punches him in the nose. *He tries to grab a cigar rolling down the street, and successfully grabs it, but it is now in a drainage grate (\\"I got it! I got it! Uh... I think I got it...\\"). His fingers accidentally let go of the cigar and it falls into the sewer. *He grabs what he thinks is a cigar from a man with a bunch of them in his pockets, but, as he bites down on it, he realizes it is actually a fountain pen that is now leaking with ink. *He picks up a white pipe-like object, but it gets blasted to bits as it is actually a target in an amusement park shooting gallery. A barker then says, \\"And the little man wins a big cigar!\\" *He looks up to see a janitor on The Empire State Building drop a cigarette. He eagerly holds out his hand to get it, and even tries to use a ladder to get it when it briefly lands on the building's mid-section, but when he does, nothing but ashes are left of the cigarette. *Finally, he begs an elderly banker for any tobacco products he has on himself (\\"Hey mister, you got a cig, a fag, a pipe, nail, weed, rope or chaw or... cigar, or snuff, or anything?! Just anything!\\"); he gives him an exploding cigar, which George still smokes, while the narrator says, \\"Give a smoker enough rope, and... he'll hang on to his habit.\\" ==Historical and cultural references== * One of the Goofys in this short is smoking a cigarette from \\"Phyllis Morrison\\", which is a parody of Phillip Morris. A subsequent Goofy skywrites an ad telling viewers to \\"Smoke LOOKYs\\", which parodies the advertising message, \\"Smoke LUCKYs\\" (Lucky Strike brand). * Pinto Colvig had been a longtime smoker and was suffering with lung disease at the time this short was made. He was a pioneer in the effort to require warning labels on cigarette packages. Pinto died of lung cancer in 1967, almost a year after Walt Disney died from the same cause. ==Voice cast== * Goofy: Pinto Colvig ==References== ==External links== * Category:1951 films Category:Disney animated short films, 1950s Category:American films Category:Goofy (Disney) short films Category:1951 animated films Category:Films directed by Jack Kinney Category:Films produced by Walt Disney Category:Films scored by Paul Smith (film and television composer) ","title":"No Smoking (1951 film)"},{"id":"3227008","text":"Kim Clarke Champniss is a Canadian television personality and musician, best known as a VJ for MuchMusic during the 1980s. ==Background== Kim was born in Bahrain and raised in London, England.\\"Music puts glow in his eye now\\".

The second tropical cyclone and the first named storm of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season, Allison formed on June 24 in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. Development of Allison was a result of the interaction of a tropical wave and the remnants of Pacific hurricane Hurricane Cosme. It moved south and became a tropical storm on June 26. By June 27, Allison made landfall near Freeport, Texas. Allison quickly weakened to a tropical depression later that day, and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the following day. The storm caused heavy rainfall, amounting to in some places. In total, 11 fatalities resulted from the storm, as well as $560 million (1989 USD, $ USD) in damage. ==Meteorological history== Three meteorological phenomena combined to produce Tropical Storm Allison. First, Hurricane Cosme moved northward through Mexico in response to a strong mid to upper-level ridge. Its remnants entered the Gulf of Mexico on June 22, when a westward moving tropical wave reached the area. Finally, a strong anticyclone over the Gulf allowed for the disturbed area to organize into Tropical Depression Two in the western Gulf of Mexico on June 24. The depression continued to organize as it drifted to the north, and became Tropical Storm Allison on June 26 off the Texas coast. A ridge to Allison's north weakened in response to an approaching frontal trough, and the tropical storm accelerated to the north. Allison reached a peak of winds just before hitting near Freeport, Texas on June 27. It turned to the northeast with the front, weakened to a tropical depression on June 27, and became extratropical on June 28. The frontal trough outran the system, and the building ridge to Allison's north forced the extratropical depression turned to the south and southwest. After executing a cyclonic loop over Texas, the ridge to the north began to erode, allowing Allison to track northeast and out of the state. Its circulation dissipated on July 1, but the remnants retained some organization, and continued to the northeast. On July 3 and July 4, the shortwave that influenced the remnants of Allison accelerated ahead of the storm, causing Allison to become stationary over the borders of Kentucky, Illinois, and Indiana. A second shortwave trough brought the remnants of Allison southward into Alabama. It turned to the northwest, and the remnants of Allison became unidentifiable over Arkansas on July 7. ==Preparations== In preparation for Tropical Storm Allison, a tropical storm watch was issued on June 24 for Baffin Bay, Texas to Morgan City, Louisiana. By June 26, this alert was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. All advisories were discontinued the next day. ==Impact== Map of rainfall from Allison across the United States ===Texas=== The slow movement of Allison and its remnants resulted in heavy rainfall over East Texas, with some areas receiving more than . Severe flooding occurred, with more than 6,200 homes suffering water damage, which forced hundreds of residents to evacuate and stranding thousands of other people. Losses in Texas were estimated between $200 million and $400 million. Additionally, there were three deaths in the state, all of which due to drowning.

There is an area in the park where not even a single sun's ray can penetrate. And for this reason the area has been known as ‘losing area of seven fellow-men’ or land of no return. The vegetation is admixture of Quercus, Schima wallichii, Betula, Michelia champaca, Pinus kesiya, Prunus, Myrica, Rhododendron, Chimonobambusa callosa, canes and a variety of orchids and lichens. Two species of Ceropegia belonging to the Asclepiadaceae plant family have been discovered in Murlen National Park, These two species of plants have been named as Ceropegia mizoramensis and Ceropegia murlensis which are derived from the state and the locality of Park. ==Fauna== Fauna found here include the tiger, leopard, sambar, barking deer, Malayan giant squirrel, Himalayan black bear, serow, hoolock gibbon, rhesus macaque, Hume's pheasant, kalij pheasant, grey partridge, hill myna, and dark-rumped swift.

The narrator shows the audience, with Goofy as the model, learn about proper breathing exercises, skipping rope for conditioning, as well as punching the bag to measure coordination, agility, and developing the skill of \\"covering up\\", and shadow boxing literally against his shadow, normally used for perfecting form and timing. The shadow makes his appearance as the narrator explain about good sportsmanship when both fighters give a friendly handshake before they pit their skills. (The shadow gave Goofy a real vice-grip of a handshake.) Then the narrator explains the use of common blows (or punches), such as the right cross, the left cross, and the \\"double cross\\". With the motion of the slow-motion camera, Goofy is trying to deliver the uppercut against the shadow, much like a ballet dancer, but the opponent countered the blow and sends the Goof flying across the hall. Then the camera \\"rewinds\\" the scene, and resumes at normal speed, until the \\"frame\\" stops to where Goofy was almost hit by a real uppercut as the narrator explains how the course of the blow as the entire weight of the body is brought into play with terrific force and the action resumes. It's also important of not forgetting to duck (lower oneself against the blow). The shadow demonstrates more of the miscellaneous punches such as the left-hand jab, bolo, rabbit, solar plexus, backhand, and the roundhouse punch. Of course, there are rules involving fouls when the shadow hits Goofy below the belt, something that every fighter in boxing should never do, because it is very unsportsmanlike, unethical, unnecessary, and uncomfortable. (Goofy tries to protect himself by raising his pants and the beltline, but with little success as his opponent manages to find his way around the situation.) And finally Goofy feels ready for the boxing ring as he faces off a different boxer as he charges at the opponent. But the foe, sporting a Navy anchor tattoo, knocks Goofy's lights out with a left haymaker. Time ever marches on in the art of self-defense. ==Production== The cartoon was one of the first to feature many replicas of Goofy at one time.

The park hosts a wide variety of wildlife. ==History== Initially comprising of the Palamu Tiger Reserve, an additional was added to the park in 1989 and of the Mahuadar wolf sanctuary. Betla was one of the first national parks in India to become a tiger reserve under Project Tiger, in 1974. The park is under administration of the Forest Department. ==Flora== The forests of the park have a vast range of vegetation consisting of sal and bamboo as the major components along with a number of medicinal plants. The North Koel River and its tributaries flow through the northern portion of the park, producing grasslands. ==Fauna== A monkey in the Betla National Park The park has a variety of diverse eco-systems and abundance of wild animals. Elephants in large numbers are seen mostly between the end of the monsoon season, to the time when water holes begin to dry in March. Predators include the sloth bear and panther, while scavengers include the wolf, jackal and hyena. Other animals include large herds of gaur and chital, large families of langurs, rhesus monkeys, Indian giant squirrels, mouse deer, sambhar deer, four-horned antelopes, nilgai, kakar, small Indian civets, ant eating pangolin, porcupine and mongoose. White tigers that remained in the park were transported to zoos. Birds include the hornbill, peafowl, red jungle fowl, black partridge, white-necked stork, black ibis, swamp grey, quail, pied hornbill, wagtail, harial, dove, drongo, crested serpent-eagle, forest owlet, papeeha, and other birds usually found in dry deciduous forests. The Kamaldah lake attracts several varieties of water birds including the common whistling, cotton teal, knob-billed duck, snipe and geese. ==Other points of interest== The park features waterfalls and hot springs. There are also two historical forts known as Palamu Forts, one of them situated near the Betla at , erected in the 16th century as the seat of Chero Kings. It is now deep inside the forest, but the main sentinel of the old fort is visible high on the hill with defences in three directions and three main gates. ==Tourism== The park provides several opportunities to observe a variety of wildlife at close range. There are elephant rides and jeeps available with guides for venturing inside the park. Watch towers and ground hides have been constructed to view the wildlife. The park is open throughout the year. Wildlife sightings are highest in the hot season (May to June), when foliage is not as thick. The most comfortable time to visit in terms of climate is between November and March. ===Access=== Betla village (at ) is the only entry point to the park. The driving distance to the village is south from Medininagar, northwest from Latehar and northwest from Ranchi. ===Accommodation=== The accommodation facilities in the tourist complex include a three star hotel, tourist lodges with canteen, log huts and tree houses inside the forest with fully furnished suites. The tree house overlooks a watering hole a few yards away where the animals gather in the summers to quench their thirst. There is grassland near tree house and canteen, where herds of Spotted Deer come to graze. Subscriber trunk dialling/International direct dialing, postal and internet facilities are available in the reserve area. For local tourists, Core Area Division runs a tourist bus on Saturday and Sunday. Jharkhand Tourism Development Corporation operates the Van Vihar for accommodation.

He possesses the ability to project plasma as destructive bolts or as an energy stream to allow himself to fly. As of Issue #12, he also has to live inside a containment suit similar to Fuji's. ==Fictional character biography== Nigel is born Irish in Belfast. He serves in the British police constabulary in Belfast for some years before moving to London. There, he falls in love with Anne, his partner while investigating the IRA. Their relationship lasts until an Irish terrorist/mercenary by the name of Seamus O'Brien, kills her in front of him. In the ensuing fight, Keane is mortally wounded. But before dying, his powers manifest, saving his life and making him Hellstrike. O'Brien later became the villain Deathtrap, leader of the MERCs, a mercenary unit of super powered beings. Hellstrike bears a long grudge against Deathtrap for both this and Anne's murder. Nigel joined StormWatch One, the main team of superheroes serving the UN. In the Wildstorm universe, the UN is secretly a menacing worldwide conspiracy led by gun-toting, paranoid \\"Secret Masters\\". While they are heroes, the operatives of StormWatch are quite ruthless and do not hesitate to violate the rights of a country in order to advance the agenda of the UN. After a battle against Deathtrap, Hellstrike was severely injured, falls into coma and his neural circuitry began to fall apart. His body starts to lose cohesion and breaks into pure energy in a tremendous explosion that ruined Skywatch's sickbay. At this time, Nigel decides to give up his life. Then, Fuji contacted him in his comatose state and persuaded him that his life was still worth something, with Fuji using himself as an example. With the help of StormWatch engineering genius Link, Nigel received a tailor-made containment suit, much like Fuji's, except that Fuji's gives him the control of his own density and avoids radioactive gas leaks, while Hellstrike's acts as a force field preventing him from exploding. He can manipulate it at will, such as when he learned he could grow genitalia, something he offered to show his teammates. They refused. Unfortunately, others can manipulate it, such as when the High grabs his chest and immobilized him. ===Reformation=== When Bendix reshapes StormWatch, Hellstrike was attached to StormWatch Prime under Winter's command. StormWatch Prime was the unit devoted to deal with superhuman threats in hotwar situations. At some point, he began a relationship with Fahrenheit that they kept secret until Weatherman Battalion found out – it was contrary to regulations about fraternization between field officers. This was discovered when Battalion had to break into Hellstrike's quarters because neither he nor Lauren were responding to the radio calls. Hellstrike is one of the four super-powered beings slain during an attack by Xenomorphs on Skywatch in the WildC.A.T.s/Aliens crossover, along with Fahrenheit, Fuji, and others. ===Rebirth=== Hellstrike and his other dead teammates return, partly detailed in the series Stormwatch: Post Human Division. The four play a support role to the PHD team, a compressed version of Stormwatch deeply affected by budget cuts. Hellstrike is featured in a flashback in issue #2 as Fahrenheit fondly recalls his assistance in a fight against the criminal known as 'The Walking Ghost'. Hellstrike later helps the PHD team escape the ice-encased precinct house they use as a headquarters. In the Stormwatch PHD issue of Wildstorm: Armageddon, it is suggested that Hellstrike and his dead teammates were saved by a possible future version of Jackson King. ===The New 52=== In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, which merged the WildStorm and DC Universes, a version of Hellstrike having a different surname & ethnicity returns at the beginning of Jim Starlin's run (issue #19) of the third volume of Stormwatch. While not a member of the original team, Hellstrike appears as a member of the secondary group that forms after a time warp erases the original team from existence. ==Powers and abilities== Hellstrike is a seedling (mutant), the people who were genetically affected by the Comet Effect of the 1960s. He's a living weapon of pure energy, what the scientist call a gaseous sentient posthuman entity. He can fire explosive plasma bolts, build a protective plasma shield and fly by means of his energy jet stream. Unfortunately, since one of his first missions, he's been bound to a containment suit that prevents him from dispersing. Hellstrike is immune to telepathy due to being more energy in nature than human. Formerly a Scotland Yard inspector, he also proved to be a valuable asset in non-combat situation. Having operated initially in Northern Ireland, he's particularly good at counter-terrorism.

The administrative headquarters of the district is at Barwani. Barwani district has an area of 5,427 km² and a population 1,385,881 (2011 census). The district lies in the southwestern corner of Madhya Pradesh; the Narmada River forms its northern boundary. The Satpura Range lies to its south. The district is bordered by Maharashtra state to the south, Gujarat state to the west, Dhar District to the north and Khargone District to the east. ==History== In the historical context, Barwani district is described as a rich and fertile land due to Narmada basin. District and its headquarters share the same name. Carved out of Khargone (West-Nimar) district Barwani was formed on 25th May 1998. Between the ranges of Vindyachal and Satpura, the Narmada Valley was the region of Aadi manav the early man. The excavation carried out by Archaeological survey of India near the village Chikhalda on the bank of Narmada river in between Khaperkheda and Barwani at village Pipri shows the presence of human civilization some five thousand years back, inhabited by the tribals practising shifting cultivation called Jhum. The name Badwani originated from the forests of Bad (Banyan tree) which had surrounded the city in old times. Wani is the old word for the garden and hence city got its name Badwani which means garden of Bads. Barwani is still pronounced as Badwani but it spells Barwani. Although the old district west Nimar was ruled by the Satavahanas, Kardamakas, Abhiras, Imperial Gupta, Kalachuris, Vardhana, Chalukyas, Rastrakutas, Pratiharas and the Paramaras; yet there was evidence in the form of copper plate of Subandhu to confirm that the district was under the rule of an independent chief Maharaja Subandhu during the fifth century (468 A.D.). Till 1311 no other evidence found to be determined the dynasty which ruled over the state except the Sesodias of Barwani.The district came under the reigns of Sultans of Malwa almost from the end of 14th century. The fertile valley of Narmada witnessed ups and downs of imperialism. The founder of the Barwani empire was belonging to Guhilot, Suryavanshi dynasty.His forefathers lived in village Sisoda of Rajasthan for quite sometime, so also are called Sisodiyas. In the 14th century by a Sisodia Prince from Mewar, who migrated into the Narmada Valley, and settled at Avasgarh, a hill in the Satpuras, about 78 kilometres southwest of the present capital. Until 1650, the state was called Avasgadh, after its original capital. The Rana family of Udaipur came in search of livehood in the Nimar region and slowly seized the simple tribals on the basis of their subordination. It is said that the Barwani state was established by Dhanak, a warrior who made his kingdom at Awasgarh. Rana Limbaji of Badwani state was succeeded by his eldest son Rana Chandra Singh in 1640 who founded modern Barwani town. He made Badwani as his capital formerly known as Sidhnagar. Later on the Marathas appeared in the scene of administration from 1703 to 1823. From the beginning of the 18th century the power of the Ranas of Barwani gradually declined; their country, originally of considerable extent and situated between the Narmada and the 11 Tapti, was devastated by the Marathas, and at the time of Malcolm’s settlement of Malwa (1819), only a strip of the Satpura range, 207 kilometres in length, with the lowlands on either side, remained to them. They did not, however, become tributary to any of the Malwa Chiefs. From 1823 to 1854 Nimar was under the superior control of the Resident at Indore and after 1854, the Agent to the Governor General in central India. Unrest started all over the district during the first 20 years of British utter mismanagement, devolvement of military officers and all. The district had a record that under the able leadership of Bhima Nayak, one Khajia Naik of Sangir made an attempt to rise against the British in 1857 by cutting telegraph wires, by looting their treasury on the high road and by plundering a few places of Nimar. In October 1858 Tatya Tope, one of the foremost leaders of the Great revolt, crossed the Narmada river and reached Khandwa, but was compelled to escape to central India by way of Khargone in order to escape from the hands of British troops trying to pounce upon him. Khajia Naik, Bhil Chief Bhima and Mawasim joined Tatya Tope at Rajpur. The second fight was fought at Dhaba Baoli, a village in Barwani after which Bhima was caught. Later on, Khajia Naik was also trapped and caught by Major Suntherland with the help of some Makrani detectives and decapitate Barwani state was merged with the Madhya Bharat state after independence in 1948. Town Barwani was the capital of old Barwani State before 1948. Town Barwani was also known as Badnagar and Siddha Nagar. The place is also famous for Chool Giri, Jain pilgrimage centre of Bawangaja.Barwani has a Historic Symbol which is known as TIR-GOLA. It is located at KhandwaBaroda Road, in front of Sagar Vilas Palace and was built in the memory of late son of Raja Ranjit Singh.Before Independence Barwani was known as ‘The Paris of Nimar’. ==Economy== In 2006 the Ministry of Panchayati Raj named Barwani one of the country's 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640).

It was named after the ANTIC chip which provides 2D graphics in the computers. The magazine was published from April 1982 until June/July 1990. Antic printed type-in programs (usually in BASIC), reviews, and tutorials, among other articles. Each issue contained one type-in game as \\"Game of the Month.\\" Its main rival in the United States was ANALOG Computing, another long-lived magazine devoted to the Atari 8-bit line. Multi-system magazines COMPUTE! and Family Computing also served Atari 8-bit owners with type-in programs. ==History== NASA programmer Jim Capparell was an early Atari 8-bit owner. He quit his job on 15 January 1982 to found a magazine for the computer. Companies such as On-Line Systems, Broderbund, and Synapse Software agreed to purchase advertising in the new publication, and Capparell's staff distributed the first issue of 30 pages at the March 1982 West Coast Computer Faire. The first issue of Antic was published in April 1982. While it began as a bimonthly magazine, within a year it had gone monthly. By Christmas 1983 the magazine was 148 pages, but in 1984 Antic saw advertising sales drop by 50% in 90 days. The Antic Software catalog, bound into each issue, contained public domain software, re-released products from the Atari Program Exchange after it folded, and original titles. It helped the company avoid bankruptcy, and in 1985 it started II Computing for the Apple II series. Antic started selling games and application software under the name Antic Software after the Atari Program Exchange was closed by Atari, Inc.. The Antic Software catalog was bound into issues of the magazine and included former APX titles. In 1985 Antic began ST Resource, a section of the magazine devoted to the Atari ST line. In 1986 it began STart Magazine for the computer. The daughter magazine would outlive its parent by about a year. When Antic ended, it continued as a section of STart, appearing in six more issues. A magazine for the Amiga, the primary competitor of the Atari ST, was published from 1989 until 1991 under the name Antic's Amiga Plus. The last issue of Antic was June–July 1990. All told, 88 issues and a \\"Best of\\" book were published. ==TYPO== A utility called TYPO (\\"Type Your Program Once,\\" a play on typographical error) was used to verify that programs were typed in correctly that generated set of check-sums for different portions of the lines of code, but it didn't help users find exactly which line had the error. TYPO was later succeeded by TYPO II, a smaller, faster program that generates a checksum two letter code for each Atari BASIC line entered in a program. By comparing each line's checksum with that printed in the magazine, the reader could be sure they typed the BASIC source correctly before entering the next line of code. Versions of TYPO were also published and used (with permission) by Page 6 magazine. ANALOG magazine also used a two-letter checksum code for their type-in programs they offered and was interoperable with Antic's TYPO II. ==References== ==External links== *Antic Magazine - At the Classic Computer Magazine Archive * *The Antic Magazine Library at the Centre for Computing History Category:Defunct computer magazines published in the United States Category:Atari 8-bit computer magazines Category:Magazines established in 1982 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1990 Category:1982 establishments in the United States Category:1990 disestablishments in the United States ","title":"Antic (magazine)"},{"id":"3227179","text":"Burhanpur District is a district of Madhya Pradesh state in central India.

Many of the mills of the area were formerly blade mills used for sharpening them, after a scythesmith had forged them from iron, with a thin strip of steel along the cutting edge. From the late 18th century until about 1870, the Waldron family of Field House Clent were the leading manufacturers. They were succeeded by Isaac Nash, whose business finally closed in about 1970.

Her mother is the English Liz Thompson-Miranda; Her father is the Brazilian artist Luiz Aquila, who is also a visual artist. The family subsequently lived in both England and France. Miranda said that she wanted to be an opera singer when she was younger, but later studied art instead. Smoke City played major venues and festivals in the UK and Europe. Their first album, Flying Away, was released in 1997, followed in 2001 by Heroes Of Nature. Some of Smoke City's songs, and other writing collaborations Miranda has been involved with, have appeared in films and advertising. In a podcast on the Myspace website of Zeep, the duo that she later formed with fellow Smoke City member, Chris Franck, it was revealed that Smoke City had decided to fold because of pressure exerted on the band by their record label. Zeep released an album in July 2007, eponymously named Zeep. In 2009, Zeep released a second album, People & Things. Miranda has also worked with a variety of artists, performing on tracks for Da Lata, Nitin Sawhney, Basement Jaxx, Cirque du Soleil, Bebel Gilberto, Daniel Jobim, Antonio Chainho, Spiller, Faze Action, Jah Wobble, Les Gammas, Troubleman, Arkestra 1, Hajime Yoshizawa, Robert Miles and DAXUVA. Nina joined musical forces with Dennis Wheatley in forming the group Shrift. The principal result of this collaboration was the 2006 release, Lost in a Moment. Miranda and her partner from Smoke City and Zeep, Chris Franck, had two sons together. They separated in 2011. In 2018, Miranda released Le Jardin, with the Portuguese producer DAXUVA. \\"Hummingbird\\" was the first single and made it to the top on several countries. ==References== == External links == *Talking about Shrift *Zeep MySpace link with audio samples Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:People from Brasília Category:Brazilian people of English descent Category:English people of Brazilian descent Category:English singer- songwriters Category:Far Out Recordings artists Category:Brazilian emigrants to England Category:Brazilian emigrants to France Category:21st-century English women singers Category:21st-century English singers ","title":"Nina Miranda"},{"id":"3227198","text":"ANALOG Computing (an acronym for Atari Newsletter And Lots Of Games) was an American computer magazine devoted to Atari 8-bit family of home computers. It was published from 1981 until 1989. In addition to reviews and tutorials, ANALOG printed multiple programs in each issue for users to type in. The magazine had a reputation for listings of machine language games–much smoother than those written in Atari BASIC--and which were uncommon in competing magazines. Such games were accompanied by the assembly language source code. ANALOG also sold commercial games, two books of type-in software, and access to a custom bulletin-board system. Originally the title as printed on the cover was A.N.A.L.O.G. 400/800 Magazine, but by the eighth issue it changed to A.N.A.L.O.G. Computing. Though the dots remained in the logo, it was simply referred to as ANALOG or ANALOG Computing inside the magazine. While the program listings were covered under the magazine's copyright protections, users were granted the right to type them into their computer for personal use, so long as they were not sold or copied. ==History== ANALOG was co- launched by Lee H. Pappas and Michael DesChesnes who met at a Star Trek convention in 1978. The first issue of the magazine was January / February 1981. It was published bi-monthly through the November / December 1983 issue and then monthly from January 1984 on. When the Atari ST was announced in 1985, it was initially covered in ANALOG. Pappas soon launched an Atari ST- specific new magazine, ST-Log. (This is paralleled in STart magazine being spun off from Antic.) In 1988, Pappas announced in an ST-Log editorial that both it and ANALOG Computing were under new ownership and the offices moved from Worcester, Massachusetts to North Hollywood, California. The relocation resulted in circulation being interrupted between issues 57 and 58 (from October 1987 to March 1988). It was addressed in ANALOG issue 58. In 1989 LFP Inc. announced it would merge ANALOG and ST-Log into one Atari resource. Instead, both magazines were dropped less than a month later and the staff merged into another publication owned by Pappas, Video Games & Computer Entertainment. The final issue of ANALOG Computing was December 1989, totaling 79 issues. ==Additional products== ===ANALOG Software=== In its early years, ANALOG Computing sold games via mail order under the name ANALOG Software. Several of these were written by magazine staff members. Some games were advertised, but never completed or published, such as Sunday Driver. Released games * Crash Dive, different than the Brian Moriarty text adventure of the same name * Star Sentry * Buried Bucks * Race in Space, later printed as a type-in listing in the magazine * Carnival, licensed from Sega ===Books=== ANALOG published two books of program listings and tutorials. The A.N.A.L.O.G. Compendium (1983) contained \\"the best Atari home computer programs from the first ten issues.\\" An Atari 8-bit Extra from ANALOG Computing (1987) contained previously unpublished programs. The ANALOG Computing Pocket Reference Card was published in 1985 and sold for US$7.95. It contains a summary of Atari BASIC commands, player/missile memory layout, hardware register and operating system addresses, ATASCII characters, graphics modes, and other information. ===Bulletin board=== The ANALOG Computing Telecommunications System, or ANALOG Computing TCS, was a custom bulletin board system accessible only through paid subscription. After the TCS launched, an 8-page ANALOG Computing TCS Guide was bound into an issue of the magazine. ==ANALOG Computing writers== ===Staff=== * Tom Hudson * Brian Moriarty * Clayton Walnum ===Contributors=== * Charles F.

There is also a special version of the programme for viewers in the Channel Islands. It launched on 20 April 1961. The main version of the programme broadcasts between 18:30 and 19:00 on weekdays, with shorter bulletins at other times. The programme can be viewed anywhere in the UK (and Europe) on Sky channel 967/968 on the BBC UK regional TV on satellite service. Its main competitors are ITV West Country's main evening programme ITV News West Country in Cornwall, Devon, Isles of Scilly, southern and western Somerset and western Dorset; and ITV Channel Television's main evening programme ITV News Channel TV in the Channel Islands. Spotlight is broadcast from BBC Broadcasting House in Seymour Road, Plymouth, the headquarters of BBC South West. There are smaller studios in Barnstaple, Exeter, Paignton, Taunton and Truro. ==History== Although local radio had been broadcast from Plymouth as station 2PY between 1924 and 1934, the first regional television programme was not broadcast until 20 April 1961, just nine days before the rival ITV service from Westward Television began broadcasting. At first a ten-minute bulletin called News from the South West was read by Tom Salmon, but in under a year it had doubled in length and had been renamed as South West at Six, hosted by Sheila Tracy. The name Spotlight was adopted on 30 September 1963. Those early radio broadcasts had been made from the Athenaeum Chambers in Athenaeum Lane in Plymouth (next to what became Westward and TSW's headquarters), but just before the Second World War the BBC started looking for alternative premises. A Victorian villa named Ingledene in Seymour Road was bought from the Douglass family and this building has, as of 2012, remained the BBC's headquarters in the South West. It has been considerably extended over the years, including the addition of a new and larger television studio in 1974 in preparation for the conversion of Spotlight to colour the following year. A replacement purpose-built broadcasting centre on the opposite side of Sutton Harbour from the Barbican has been under construction since 2008 and was due to open in mid-2011, though it has since stalled due to the effect of the recession on the construction industry and a change in the original plans. In late 2012, the owner of the harbour expressed fears the move may never happen and admitted other parties had expressed an interest in moving to the site earmarked for the BBC.Inquiries over site earmarked for BBC, This is Plymouth In 2013, the BBC confirmed that it was not moving to Sutton Harbour, and instead was refurbishing its existing Plymouth headquarters.\\"BBC South West announces major investment in Plymouth Seymour Road base\\", BBC Media Centre A lighthouse motif has been in use within the programme's title sequences for many years until May 2000, when Spotlight adopted the generic BBC regional news design. The motif returned in May 2006, and the use of a lighthouse in the titles continued until the latest relaunch in June 2015. ==Presenters== Victoria Graham presents the 6.30pm programme.

Local news broadcasts for the Islands began in the 1990s, when a short bulletin aired following the Nine O'Clock News. Since October 2000, two evening bulletins have been broadcast at 6:30pm and following the News at Ten. Originally broadcast from a studio at the Fremont Point transmitter, the news service is now entirely based at the studios of BBC Radio Jersey in St Helier. The opt-outs are presented by Charlie McArdle and produced by a team of multi- skilling journalists who write, film and edit their own stories, as well as producing and directing the bulletins on weekdays. The main opt takes up the first 12 minutes of the nightly 6.30pm programme with a full opt at 10.25pm and a short 30-second update at 8pm. No opt-outs are broadcast during the day and at weekends, except for special occasions such as local elections or major sporting events such as the Island Games. Like other BBC enterprises in the Channel Islands, funding comes primarily from television licence fees collected within the Islands. ==References== ==External links== * Category:BBC Regional News shows Category:Mass media in Cornwall Category:Mass media in Dorset Category:1960s British television series Category:1970s British television series Category:1980s British television series Category:1990s British television series Category:2000s British television series Category:2010s British television series Category:2020s British television series Category:1961 British television series debuts Category:Mass media in Jersey Category:Television news in England Category:Television news in Jersey Category:Television news in Guernsey Category:Television news program articles using incorrect naming style ","title":"Spotlight (BBC News)"},{"id":"3227209","text":"Belchamp Walter is a village and civil parish in Essex, England.

The head office of Ricola is located in Laufen, Basel-Country. ==Business== Ricola listed sales of 307.2 million Swiss francs in (2016) and employs 400 workers. Around 200 independent production companies in the surrounding area service Ricola. In order to obtain enough herbs for the production of its herbal drops, the firm contracts over 100 self-managed farms in the Valais, Emmental, Val Poschiavo and at the southern foot of the Jura Mountains, in central Switzerland, and in Ticino. Ricola is known for its commercials featuring Heidi (Ramona Pringle) depicting mountaineers shouting \\"Ri-co-la!\\" and blowing through a large Alphorn. In a 2019 survey of US pharmacists, Ricola was recommended by 14% of US pharmacists, in third place, among brand name sore throat products. The survey did not cover store brands. A class action suit in February 2019 alleged non-natural ingredients (malic acid, aspartame, citric acid, sorbitol, ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate) while labels say \\"Naturally Soothing\\" or \\"Naturally Helps Support Immune System.\\" In November 2019 the judge dismissed 2 claims and let 2 claims proceed. An earlier class action suit in November 2015 alleged industrially synthesized ingredients (Ascorbic Acid, Citric Acid and Malic Acid) while labels say \\"Naturally Soothing\\". The suit was withdrawn without explanation in January 2016. ==History== Ricola began in 1930 when Emil Wilhelm Richterich and Daniel Ruoss Sr. established Confiseriefabrik Richterich & Co. Laufen after the purchase of a small bakery in Laufen, just outside Basel. Under Richterich, the bakery specialized in confectionery such as “Fünfermocken,\\" a sweet which was similar to caramel. In 1940 Richterich created Ricola's Swiss Herbal Sweet incorporating a blend of 13 herbs. In the 1950s the sweet became appreciated for its ability to be dissolved in boiling water, creating an aromatic herbal tea or tisane, which inspired Richterich to create a Ricola Herbal Tea a few years later. In 1967, Emil Richterich and his sons Hans Peter and Alfred renamed the company Ricola, an abbreviation of Richterich & Compagnie Laufen. Export began in the 1970s, introducing Ricola's products to foreign markets. At the end of the decade, Ricola moved to a new purpose-built factory in the vicinity of Laufen, where its headquarters are still located. In 1976, after extensive research on sugar-free confectionery, Ricola launched Switzerland’s first chewable, sugarless herbal sweet. Ricola first started to advertise its products on television in the 1980s, an era that saw increased awareness of the need for good dental hygiene, increasing the demand for sugar-free products such as the ones that Ricola offered. In 1988 the company started packaging their products in small boxes. The company is now managed by Thomas P. Meier as CEO and Felix Richterich as President of the Board. Today, Ricola exports to over 50 countries in Asia, North America and Europe. ==Herbs== Ricola herbal cough drop While the active ingredient in most Ricola products is menthol, an important part of Ricola products is the herb mixture.

They are situated on the northern side of the mouth of the River Avon, opposite the Royal Portbury Dock on the southern side, where the river joins the Severn estuary, within Avonmouth. Accessible via a long and wide lock, today the docks are one of the UK's major ports for chilled foods, especially fruit and vegetables. Land-side freight access and distribution is via either the M5 motorway or the Henbury Loop Line, whilst rail-passenger access is via Avonmouth railway station on the Severn Beach Line. ==Background== Bristol Harbour had always been a major centre of trade within the wider UK economy, due to its strategic location to the west of the country, allowing access to both the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. Coastal trade was also important, with the area called \\"Welsh Back\\" concentrating on trows with cargoes from the Slate industry in Wales, stone, timber and coal. However, by the 18th century the docks in Liverpool grew larger and so increased competition with Bristol for the tobacco trade. The limitations of Bristol's docks were causing problems to business, so in 1802 William Jessop proposed installing a dam and lock at Hotwells to create the floating harbour. Construction of the £530,000 scheme began in May 1804, including the construction of the Cumberland Basin, the tidal new cut and a feeder canal to Temple Meads. Entrance was via locks, which had a maximum width of . The harbour was officially opened on 1 May 1809. However, the harbour improvements cost more than anticipated, requiring increased levies to pay back the required loans, and hence reducing the competitive advantage to Liverpool. By 1867, ships were getting larger and the meanders in the river Avon prevented boats over from reaching the harbour. A scheme was proposed to install a much larger lock at Avonmouth to make the entire river a floating harbour, and to straighten the sharper bends, was but was dropped after work began on the much cheaper docks at Avonmouth and Portishead. The present entrance lock was designed by Thomas Howard and opened in July 1873, with a width of . ==History== ===Development=== Due to numerous geographic and tidal restrictions along the River Avon, the Avonmouth Docks Co. was formed to build the new docks at Avonmouth. The new docks, now called Avonmouth Old Dock, were opened in 1877, together with the supporting Bristol Port Railway and Pier. The BPRP was built and held via a separate sister company, running north for from Hotwells (originally called Clifton), northwards to west of Bristol city centre between the Clifton Suspension Bridge and Bridge Valley Road along the Avon Gorge, to a pier terminus at Avonmouth. ===Transport=== The Railway Clearing House Atlas of 1914 shows the then-extensive railway network around Avonmouth. As built, the BPRP was isolated from the rest of the national railway network, having not been intended for anything more than local traffic distribution - a docks railway. However, due to the position of Clifton station and the large amount of developed land in the Hotwells area, an extension towards the city's main station at , would have been prohibitively expensive. Instead, a link was proposed from the BPRP at Sneyd Park, running under Clifton Down and through the suburbs to connect to the main lines of the Midland Railway and the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway. The connection was authorised in 1867, but the BPRP was in financial difficulties, and so unable to complete the line. It entered into negotiations with the MR and Great Western Railway, the latter now the owner of the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway. However, fierce competition between the GWR and the MR posed a threat to the Port of Bristol. The MR had no access over the GWR routes into either Bristol Harbour or Avonmouth docks, and so drew up options to either acquire the Avonmouth Docks Co., or build new docks on the opposite bank at Portbury. The result was that in 1884, the Bristol Corporation bought Avonmouth Docks and the BPRP to control port facilities in the area. The Clifton Extension Railway initially ran from to Narroways Hill Junction north through Bristol, then part of the GWR; and over a viaduct from Narroways Hill to the MR's Bristol to Gloucester Line near . The line was managed by the Clifton Extension Railway Joint Committee, a triumvirate of the Port Authority, City Council plus the GWR and MR; but in 1894 responsibility was passed to the Great Western & Midland Railways Joint Committee. Services began to Clifton Down on 1 October 1874. ===Royal Edward Dock=== Royal Edward Dock, March 2014 The Royal Edward Dock was designed by consulting engineers Benjamin Baker and John Wolfe-Barry, who had worked together on several dock projects, together with Baker’s partner A.C. Hurtzig, and C.A. Brereton. The docks run south to north along the banks of the River Severn, closer to that river than the existing Avonmouth Docks, and is the northernmost and largest of the three docks that form the Port of Bristol. Work began in 1902, when the then Prince of Wales cut the first sod, which included the construction of a dry dock. The complex was opened by the then King Edward VII in 1908. Royal Edward Dock, November 2017 Throughout its life, the shore side dock facilities have been redeveloped to keep the docks operational. By 1911, 27 storage tanks for oil had been added on the north west quay, and new grain silos were built in 1928. During World War II the docks were enlarged from 1941, adding more facilities for unloading oil and petrol, plus a new oil products supply pipeline to London via the Government Pipelines and Storage System. By the 1960s, the larger container ships could not navigate the River Avon to enter the Royal Edward, necessitating the need for the planning of the construction of the Royal Portbury Dock on the south bank. Whilst much of the former warehousing was redeveloped as residential housing, the residual quays were redeveloped for new cargos. Today these range from the export of scrap-metals, dredged aggregates, vegetable oil and domestic coal; with regional container services from and to Ireland, Europe and Scandinavia, all linked to the rail network via the Henbury Loop Line. ===Mustard gas=== During the later part of World War I, it was proposed to make Avonmouth the UK centre of production of dichloroethyl sulphide, also known as mustard gas. However, its production was against the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, which explicitly forbade the use of \\"poison or poisoned weapons\\" in warfare. Under the cover of the Official Secrets Act, the Ministry of Munitions under its then Minister Winston Churchill nationalised many small smelting works under the new National Smelting Company (NSC). Before the outbreak of WW1, much of Britain's zinc had originated in Australia, but had been smelted in Germany. The NSC was therefore publicly commissioned to build a new zinc smelting works and sulphuric acid plant at Merebank, Avonmouth. With the nearby No.23 Filling Factory at Chittening, plus the main plant at Banbury and a third plant at Hereford, construction of the chemical plant began at Avonmouth in 1917, but did not finish until 1923, costing £800,000. The plant came into operation from spring 1918, producing of dichloroethyl sulphide using the Despretz–Niemann–Guthrie process; the chemical agent was then placed into shells on site. Although the first product did not arrive in France until September 1918, two months before the Armistice, it was used that same month during the breaking of the Hindenburg Line within the Hundred Days' Offensive. By November 1918, Chittening had produced 85,424 mustard gas shells. The human cost of producing mustard gas was high. In December 1918 the chemical plant's medical officer reported that in the six months it was operational, there were 1,400 illnesses reported by its 1,100 mostly female workers - all medically attributable to their work. Three people died because of accidents, four died from associated illnesses, and there were 160 accidents resulting in over 1,000 burns. At Chittening there were reported 1,213 cases of associated illness, including two deaths which were later attributed to influenza. ===Britannia smelting works=== After World War I, demand for zinc and for sulphuric acid greatly fell, and after running into commercial difficulties it was taken over by a group of British industrialists with interests in metals and chemicals, under whom it was revived. In 1929 the NSC was bought by Australia's Imperial Smelting Corporation, which in 1949 merged with Zinc Corporation to become Consolidated Zinc. After the consolidation, the smaller NSC plants were closed down to concentrate production on Avonmouth - now known as the Britannia smelting works - where the famous Imperial Smelting Process was developed. From 1967, the Avonmouth Works was home to the largest and most efficient zinc blast furnace in the world. Consolidated Zinc, having failed to develop suitable new mining projects, merged from 1962 with the Rio Tinto Company, a mining company. The resulting company, known as the Rio Tinto - Zinc Corporation (RTZ), and its main subsidiary, Conzinc Riotinto of Australia (CRA), would eventually become today's Rio Tinto Group. With smelting cheaper elsewhere in the world, the site ceased production in the 1970s, but remained open as a stock-holding and distribution centre until 2003. In 2012 SITA UK started redevelopment of the site, but after construction workers were affected by mustard-gas type symptoms, the Ministry of Defence were called in to test and approve the site. However, after MoD approval, a few months later construction workers found a mustard gas shell, which was disposed of by the 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment RLC at Porton Down. The site was closed off for a year while experts from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory conducted a series of tests. In late 2013 MoD clearance was given, allowing the site to be redeveloped as a supermarket distribution centre for Asda, and a recycling plant for SITA UK. ==Operations== The docks were operated by the Port of Bristol Authority, part of Bristol City Council, until 1991, when the council granted a 150-year lease to the Bristol Port Company, who now operate the docks together with Royal Portbury Dock. ===Bulk Coal Terminal=== The bulk coal terminal discharges imported coal from both the Royal Edward and Royal Portbury docks, via a rail-loading system managed by DB Cargo UK, located just south of St Andrews Road railway station on the Severn Beach line. At the Royal Edward, a Gottwald HSK 260 Harbour Crane can unload up to 10,000 tonnes of coal per day; whilst two 2,500 tonne rapid bulk- handling conveyors at Royal Portbury discharge into a conveyor system which runs under the River Avon in a tunnel. Freight trains are moved automatically under the bunkers at , allowing a train to be fully and automatically loaded in under 36 minutes. ==References== ==External links== *The Bristol Port Company website *Elkins, P.W.

As a young man he took part in the Battle of Borodino and other engagements of the Napoleonic Wars. Many years later, Tolstoy's description of the battle in War and Peace would appear inaccurate to him and he would engage in a literary feud with the great novelist. In the 1820s Vyazemsky was the most combative and brilliant champion of what then went by the name of Romanticism. Both Prince Pyotr and his wife Princess Vera, née Gagarina were on intimate terms with Pushkin, who often visited their family seat at Ostafievo near Moscow (now a literary museum). Unsurprisingly, Vyazemsky is quoted in Pushkin's works, including Eugene Onegin. The two friends also exchanged several epistles in verse. Vyazemsky and the other leading Russian liberals such as Pushkin and Aleksandr and Nikolay Turgenev, were all heavily shaped by the Kantian teachings of Aleksandr Kunitsyn, and often discussed their attitudes on serfdom, the Russian administration and legal system, civil society, and foreign policy through private correspondence, where Vyazemsky was highly critical of the administrations abuses in the western province. He also published a prospectus declaring an \\"uncompromising war to all the prejudices, vices and absurdity that reign in our society.\\" At that time, the elderly poet gained admission to the Russian court, in part through his daughter's marriage to Pyotr Valuev, the future Chairman of the Committee of Ministers. In the 1850s, Vyazemsky served as a deputy minister of education and was in charge of the censorship in Russia. In 1863, he settled abroad on account of bad health. Prince Vyazemsky died in Baden-Baden, but his body was brought to St. Petersburg and buried there. == Literary output == Vyazemsky is probably best remembered as the closest friend of Alexander Pushkin. Their correspondence is a treasure house of wit, fine criticism, and good Russian. In the early 1820s, Pushkin proclaimed Vyazemsky the finest prose writer in the country. His prose is sometimes exaggeratedly witty, but vigor and raciness are ubiquitous. His best is contained in the admirable anecdotes of his Old Notebook, an inexhaustible mine of sparkling information on the great and small men of the early nineteenth century. A major prose work of his declining years was the biography of Denis Fonvizin. Though Vyazemsky was the journalistic leader of Russian Romanticism, there can be nothing less romantic than his early poetry: it consists either of very elegant, polished, and cold exercises on the set commonplaces of poetry, or of brilliant essays in word play, where pun begets pun, and conceit begets conceit, heaping up mountains of verbal wit. His later poetry became more universal and essentially classical. ==Bibliography== * Собрание сочинений Вяземского в 12 тт. СПб. 1878—1886, его переписка, «Остафьевский архив», т.

His proposers for the latter were Ralph Copeland, John McLaren, Lord McLaren, Peter Guthrie Tait and James Burgess. He was awarded an honorary doctorate Doctor of Science from the University of the Cape of Good Hope in 1899. In 1908 he was elected a Fellow of the newly created Royal Society of South Africa. In South Africa he pursued his interest in astronomy, first measuring the parallax and proper motion of Alpha Centauri and Beta Centauri. He then became a prolific observer of variable stars, particularly those that were members of a binary system. He continued his observations for over 30 years, and pioneered the study of close binary systems. He published over 100 works on these topics. Between 1891 and 1920 he made over 250,000 observations of 98 variable stars. In 1913 he served as president of the South African branch of the African Astronomical Society (S.A.-A.A.S). Much of his work was communicated through Edward C. Pickering, the director of the Harvard College Observatory. However, with the death of Pickering in 1919 he ceased further research. Instead he began to focus on politics and race relations in South Africa, teaching at the South African Native College at Fort Hare. The Prime Minister Jan Smuts appointed him as a senator to represent the interests of native Africans on the Native Affairs Commission in 1920, which he also chaired. Seen as an able and unbiased mediator he also chaired the commission into the 1920 riots at Port Elizabeth and the 1922 Bondelswarts Rebellion. In 1923 he also chaired the Native Churches Commission. In 1925, however, he did serve as the South African delegate to the I.A.U. General Assembly. In 1930 he sat as a Member of the Native Economic Commission. He died at Alice in South Africa on 21 January 1938. ==Recognition== The crater Roberts on the Moon is co-named for him and Sir Isaac Roberts. ==Family== In 1894 he was married to Elizabeth Dunnett.

Counsel for Garlock, Garland Cassada of the Charlotte NC law firm Robinson, Bradshaw & Hinson, was successful in persuading Judge George Hodges to permit full discovery of 15 high-value asbestos claims settled by Garlock when it was a solvent entity. Using data obtained from these cases by Cassada, Professor Brickman's expert report set forth evidence of fraud, misrepresentation and \\"double-dipping\\" (contradictory accounts of exposure between tort and bankruptcy-trust claims) in all 15 cases, the net effect of which was to inflate the value of future claims that may be made against the bankrupt entity.Gvillo, Heather Isringhausen. \\"A Look at Two Rulings $1B Apart in Bankruptcy Proceedings of Garlock, Bondex.\\" Legal Newsline (August 12, 2014).Fisher, Daniel. \\"A Stubborn Manufacturer Exposes the Asbestos Blame Game.\\" Forbes (March 25, 2015).Tomsic, Michael. \\"In Charlotte, Judge Describes Asbestos Litigation 'Infected with the Impropriety of Some Law Firms'.\\" WFAE 90.7 (January 23, 2014).

In his teaching, Brickman employed a very rigorous Socratic method during class meetings, combining a fast-paced banter with students leavened along the way by his idiosyncratic phrases and original anecdotes, frequently using his catchphrases \\"make a legal noise\\" or \\"difference in degree or difference in kind\\". The overall effect was intended to scare students into closer reading of case texts (a la the character Professor Kingsfield in The Paper Chase).On this point, see \\"Review & Comment\\" [editorial] Cardozo Law Forum 6, no. 1 (February 21, 1984): 2.

The Class of 1979 consisted of 300 students, of whom nearly half were women, reflecting the progressive agenda that had recruited women to the founding faculty. Competition for students, however, was keen, and ethnic and racial diversity difficult to achieve.

He said of this later that \\"If we had not gotten our accreditation, or if it had been postponed, half our student body would have transferred, faculty would have left, and we would have been permanently barred from the upper echelon of law schools.\\"Contemporaneous views of these concerns from the Cardozo Law Forum student newspaper include Yatvin, Alan L. \\"Fall Inspection by ABA; Still No Request by Brickman to Upgrade Status.\\" Cardozo Law Forum 4, no. 3 (March 11, 1981): 1 and 9. \\"ABA Gives Ok; Accreditation Confirmation Likely.\\" Cardozo Law Forum 5, no. 2 (December 1, 1981): 1;Yatvin, Alan L. \\"ABA Grants Cardozo Final Accreditation.\\" Cardozo Law Forum 5, no. 3 (January 27, 1982): 1, and \\"Final Accreditation Means ...\\" on pp.6-7 of the same issue; Cardozo Law Forum 5, no. 3 (January 27, 1982): 6-7.

His emergency-management challenges were not over, however. The Cardozo's liberal origins and left-leaning faculty had attracted a significant contingent of what Brickman later called \\"Berkeley '60s-type students.\\" He recounted to Gary Goldenberg in 2002 that the editors of the student newspaper \\"and others had decided that the law school was not sufficiently diverse.\\"\\"We're All White.\\" Cardozo Law Forum 4, no. 2 (December 10, 1980): 4.

The Cardozo offered him the deanship on a permanent basis, but Brickman declined, remarking later both that he felt the school would be more successful with leadership brought in from outside, and that the acting deanship had been \\"an enormous strain on me personally.\\" Monroe E. Price, a former law school faculty member of the University of California at Los Angeles, succeeded him as dean in July 1982, concluding what Gary Goldenberg dubbed \\"the Brickman interregnum.\\"Yeshiva U.

The overwhelming demands of the Cardozo's early struggles on Brickman's intellectual resources and personal energies are reflected in his curriculum vitae, which lists no publications at all in the years 1977 through 1987, the longest such gap in his career since his first publication as a college freshman in 1958.\\"Lester Brickman\\" [curriculum vitae], April 2016. In 1976, Brickman's first year at the Cardozo, four publications by him had appeared, including a co-authored and edited issue of conference proceedings with Richard O. Lempert,Brickman, Lester, and Richard O. Lempert. Foreword and \\"Transcript of Conference Proceedings.\\" Law & Society Review 11, no. 2 (1976): 167-169 and 319-86. but he published nothing further until 1988. ==Tort reform== ===Nonrefundable retainers=== When Brickman was able to return to his scholarship, his next publication was his first—and successful—proposal for reform of the American legal system, and for stricter enforcement of traditional legal ethics. With his former student Lawrence A. Cunningham, at this writing (summer 2016), Henry St. George Tucker III Research Professor at George Washington University Law School,Webpage of Lawrence A. Cunningham, George Washington University Brickman wrote a critique of what was then a relatively common, although controversial, practice by attorneys, the use of nonrefundable retainers. \\"A nonrefundable retainer,\\" he and his co-author wrote, \\"is an agreement between lawyer and client providing for the payment of part or all of the fee in advance of the lawyer's performance. The payment is designated in the retainer agreement as nonrefundable. The dispute regarding the validity of these agreements usually arises when the client terminates the lawyer's employment without just cause before completions of the tasks and demands return of the unearned part of the advance fee.\\"Brickman, Lester, and Lawrence A. Cunningham. \\"Nonrefundable Retainers: Impermissible under Fiduciary, Statutory and Contract Law.\\" Fordham Law Review 57, no. 2 (November 1988): 150 n.1. Brickman and Cunningham argued that such agreements violate the fundamental right of the client freely to discharge the attorney.McShea, Sarah Diane. \\"Non-Refundable Fees: Pitfalls & Safe Harbors.\\" New York Legal Ethics Reporter (December 1, 2002). In 1993, the authors made this argument in an amici curiae brief in the Matter of Cooperman (83 NY2d 465), in which a New York lawyer named Edward M. Cooperman had been warned twice by the Grievance Committee for the Tenth Judicial District against agreements in which the lawyer demanded thousands of dollars in retainers, did little significant work, and declined to return any part of the retainers.Brickman and Cunningham. Amicus Brief in the Matter of Cooperman, 83 N.Y.2d 465 (N.Y. Court of Appeals 1993, (1993). The Appellate Division, which heard the grievance proceedings, suspended Cooperman from practice for two years. The New York State Court of Appeals, citing, among other legal authorities, Brickman and Cunningham's work on the highly questionable ethics of nonrefundable retainers, upheld the lower court's decision.Matter of Cooperman, 83 N.Y.2d 465 (N.Y. Ct. App. 1994). (Decided March 17, 1994) The court cited Brickman and Cunningham's \\"Nonrefundable Retainers Revisited.\\" North Carolina Law Review 72, no. 1 (1993): 6. Other state courts soon followed their example, despite opposition from some legal scholars and practicing attorneys.See, for example, Lubet, Steven. \\"The Rush to Remedies: Some Conceptual Questions about Nonrefundable Retainers.\\" North Carolina Law Review 73 (1994). Brickman and Cunningham responded to Lubet and other critics in their \\"Nonrefundable Retainers: A Response to Critics of the Absolute Ban.\\" University of Cincinnati Law Review 64, no. 1 (1995): 11; and their \\"Living with the Ban on Nonrefundable Retainers: Cooperman's Scope, Meaning and Consequences\\" New York State Bar Journal 66, no. 6 (1994): 50. One of the latter, criminal defense attorney Scott H. Greenfield, who criticized the Cooperman decision in a 2008 blog, drew attention to Brickman's academic status, opining that the professor \\"never met a practicing lawyer he didn't hate.\\"Greenfield, Scott H. \\"Nonrefundable No More.\\" In Simple Justice: a Criminal Defense Blog, December 2008. ===Contingent fees and effective hourly rates=== In the late 1980s and early 1990s, much of Professor Brickman's scholarship, like his critique of nonrefundable retainers, focused on ethical and economic issues associated with lawyers' fees, topics to which he was to return many times in the following decades, including in his 2011 book, Lawyer Barons. Brickman argues that plaintiff attorney fees have increased significantly over the last half- century, especially the contingent fees in class actions and mass torts, imposing substantial transaction costs on the economy, as well as incentives for fraud by attorneys and their clients.Examples include his \\"Contingent Fees without Contingencies: Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark?\\". UCLA Law Review 37, no. 1 (October 1989): 29-138; \\"Contingency Fee Abuses, Ethical Mandates, and the Disciplinary System: The Case against Case-by-Case Enforcement.\\" Washington and Lee Law Review 53, no. 4 (1996): 1339-80; \\"Contingency Fees: A Peril to Nation's Health.\\" Corpus Christi Caller Times, August 22, 1997; \\"Limiting Lawyers' Unearned Windfall Fees.\\" New York Law Journal (August 4, 1994): 5; Rethinking Contingency Fees: A Proposal to Align the Contingency Fee System with Its Policy Roots and Ethical Mandates (with Michael J. Horowitz, and Jeffrey O'Connell). Washington, D.C.: Manhattan Institute, 1994; \\"The James Gang Robbed Banks. Today's Lawyers Have a Better Idea.\\" St. Louis Post- Dispatch, April 27, 2001, C17; \\"Market for Contingent Fee-Financed Tort Litigation: Is It Price Competitive?\\" Cardozo Law Review 25, no. 1 (November 2003): 65-128; and \\"Will Legal Ethics Go up in Smoke?\\" Wall Street Journal, June 16, 1998, A18. Terry Carter wrote of Professor Brickman in a 1997 article in the ABA Journal that \\"he is known as something of a conservative pit bull chewing on contingency fee abuse.\\"Carter, Terry. \\"Keepin 'Em Honest: A Professor Who Crusaded against Contingency Abuses Puts a Tax Form Proposal before Congress.\\" ABA Journal (August 1997): 8. The traditional arguments in favor of the contingent fee system in American law are that 1) they permit access to the legal system for those who cannot afford to pay a lawyer, and 2) they provide incentives for attorneys to work diligently for plaintiffs, as they will be paid only if they win the case.Kritzer, Herbert M. Risks, Reputations, and Rewards: Contingency Fee Legal Practice in the United States. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford Law and Politics, 2004; Karsten, Peter. \\"Enabling the Poor to Have Their Day in Court: The Sanctioning of Contingency Fee Contracts, a History to 1940.\\" DePaul Law Review 47 (1998): 231-60; and MacKinnon, Frederick B. Contingent Fees for Legal Services; a Study of Professional Economics and Responsibilities. Chicago: Aldine Pub. Co. for American Bar Association, 1964. Advocates of the contingent fee argue that the lawyers' fee of 25 to 40 per cent of the recovery is necessarily high because of the risk of losing cases. Professor Brickman has asserted, in more than a dozen articles since 1989, that plaintiff attorneys generally do not accept cases that involve any meaningful risk, and that their effective hourly rates are as high as $25,000 in some cases.Brickman, Lawyer Barons, 35-36. In a frequently-cited article published in the Washington University Law Quarterly in 2003, Brickman asserted that \\"Since 1960, the effective hourly rates of tort lawyers have increased 1000% to 1400% (in inflation-adjusted dollars) while the overall risk of nonrecovery has remained essentially constant—though it has decreased materially for such high-end tort categories as product liability and medical malpractice.\\"Brickman, Lester. \\"Effective Hourly Rates of Contingency-Fee Lawyers: Competing Data and Non-Competitive Fees.\\" Washington University Law Quarterly 81, no. 3 (2003): 655. He argues that the American Bar Association has abdicated its ethical responsibility to curb what Brickman considers to be fee-gouging and greed on the part of the plaintiff bar,Brickman, Lester. \\"ABA Regulation of Contingency Fees: Money Talks, Ethics Walks.\\" Fordham Law Review 65, no. 1 (1996): 247, especially in mass torts like asbestos litigation, and class actions of all kinds, but especially the tobacco litigation of the 1990s.Brickman, Lester. \\"Want to Be a Billionaire? Sue a Tobacco Company.\\" Wall Street Journal, December 30, 1998, A10. ===Asbestos litigation=== Lester Brickman began speaking and writing about asbestos litigation in 1991, testifying on the asbestos litigation crisis before the House Committee on the Judiciary's Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration.Brickman, Lester. \\"Statement of Lester Brickman.\\" In Asbestos Litigation Crisis in Federal and State Courts: Hearings before the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration of the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, One Hundred Second Congress, First and Second Sessions, October 24, 1991, February 26 and 27, 1992. Washington: U.S. G.P.O., 1993. His first articles on the subject appeared in the Cardozo Law Review in 1992.Brickman, Lester. \\"Asbestos Claims Management Act of 1991: A Proposal to the United States Congress.\\" Cardozo Law Review 13, no. 6 (April 1992): 1891-918, and \\"Asbestos Litigation Crisis: Is There a Need for an Administrative Alternative?\\" in the same issue, at 1819-90. Since then, he has become one of legal academe's most outspoken critics of asbestos litigation and its economic and ethical context, stating in a 2003 article in the Pepperdine Law Review that \\"When the complete and unexpurgated history of asbestos litigation is finally written, that litigation will surely come to be considered for entry into the pantheon of such great American scandals as the Yazoo land scandals, Credit Mobilier, Teapot Dome, Billy Sol Estis [sic], the salad oil scandals, the Savings & Loan scandals, WorldCom, and Enron.\\"Brickman, Lester. \\"On the Theory Class's Theories of Asbestos Litigation: The Disconnect between Scholarship and Reality.\\" Pepperdine Law Review 31, no. 1 (2003): 35. Brickman has published (as of summer 2016) fifteen articles on asbestos litigation, and testified on the subject three times before Congressional committees (see publications list and External Links below). The subject is also addressed in his 2011 book, Lawyer Barons. In January 2005, Professor Brickman was an invited contributor to a Presidential colloquy on tort reform in asbestos litigation, with then- President George W. Bush, held at Macomb Community College, in Warren, Michigan (see External Links, below). ==Critics== Brickman's numerous critics and adversaries in academe and legal practice have vigorously disputed his claims regarding systemic ethical misconduct, fraud, abuse, and fee-gouging by the plaintiff bar.His most recent article on this subject is Brickman, Lester. \\"Fraud and Abuse in Mesothelioma Litigation.\\" Tulane Law Review 88 (2014): 1072-152. Abstract Prominent among these are University of Texas at Austin law professor Charles M. Silver,Brickman, Lester, and Charles Silver. \\"Contingency Fees -- Should Plaintiffs' Lawyers in the Tobacco Settlement Receive Billions of Dollars?\\" Cardozo Law Review 83, no. 9 (September 1997): 74-75, Herbert M. Kritzer of the University of Minnesota School of Law, the late Ronald Motley (1944-2013) of the law firm Motley Rice,Motley, Ronald L., and Susan Nial. \\"A Critical Analysis of the Brickman Administrative Proposal: Who Declared War on Asbestos Victims' Rights?\\" Cardozo Law Review 13 (1992): 1919 Paid access at HeinOnline Elihu Inselbuch of Caplin & Drysdale , American Bar Foundation researchers Stephen Daniels and Joanne Martin , and journalist Stephanie Mencimer.Mencimer, Stephanie. Blocking the Courthouse Door: How the Republican Party and its Corporate Allies are Taking Away Your Right to Sue. New York: Free Press, 2006: 86-93 and 152-154. Many of Brickman's published arguments with other scholars are enlivened by colorful rhetorical fireworks. In 2005, for example, Brickman described his three-year altercation with Charles Silver on the subject of asbestos litigation, in characteristically earthy sesquipedalian style, as a \\"micturating match.\\"Brickman, Lester. Abstract of \\"Rejoinder to the Rejoinder to On the Theory Class's Theories of Asbestos Litigation.\\" Pepperdine Law Review 32, no. 4 (2005). Abstract As Boston University law professor Susan Koniak observed in her critique of Brickman's 1994 challenge to the American Bar Association's Ethics Committee, when \\"Professor Brickman is not pleased,\\" it is not unusual for \\"sound and fury\\" to be conspicuous features of his prose.Koniak, Susan P. \\"Principled Opinions: Response to Brickman.\\" Fordham Law Review 65 (1996): 337. Brickman's publications have provoked considerable interest and debate among his fellow legal scholars. One of his articles on the ABA ethics controversy, for example, with the provocative title \\"ABA Regulation of Contingency Fees: Money Talks, Ethics Walks.\\"Fordham Law Review 65, no. 1 (1996): 247. has been downloaded from Law Commons more than 3700 times since it was uploaded to the site in 2011. Brickman announces his purpose on p. 249: \\"In this Article, I critique that Opinion [of the ABA], finding it wrong as a matter of ethics law, malevolent as a matter of public policy, disingenuous in its presentation, unfounded in the critical assumptions upon which the Opinion is based, illegitimate in its rejection of ethical considerations in favor of political partisanship, and blatantly self-interested in elevating lawyers' financial interests above their traditional fiduciary obligations to clients.\\" This characteristically vehement and pugnacious personal style often attracts media attention to Brickman's scholarship. He is a frequent speaker at Federalist Society, Lawsuit Reform Association of New York, and other tort reform organization meetings (see External Links, below). Brickman himself acknowledges that he is a controversial figure among legal scholars by choice, concluding an unapologetically argumentative 2005 essay in the Pepperdine Law Review with the assertion that: \\"This view underpins my scholarship: that identifying what is actually occurring in our legal system is, or at least ought to be, a prime purpose of scholarship; that by identifying these truths and bringing them to the attention of both the academy and the profession, I am providing an opportunity to curb abuses in the legal system; and that focusing on these abuses will ultimately be in the self-interest of the legal profession.\\"Brickman, Lester. \\"Rejoinder to the Rejoinder to On the Theory Class's Theories of Asbestos Litigation.\\" Pepperdine Law Review 32, no. 4 (2005): 791. ==Family and personal life== Lester Brickman married for the first time in the mid-1960s. His firstborn, and only son, Theodore K. Brickman, was born October 20, 1966. This marriage ended in divorce in March 1969. In July 1977, Brickman married Miriam Bellman, née Dorf (b. 1939), the daughter of a Toledo-born photographer, restaurateur, and realtor of Russian- Jewish ancestry, Eli Dorf (1911-1983), and Ruth Shore Dorf (1914-1986).\\"B'Nai Israel Sisterhood.\\" Toledo Blade, November 21, 1954, 11; \\"Librarians' Assistants,\\" Jesup W.

It is located in Uttara Kannada district, in Karnataka, India. The park is a habitat of Bengal tigers, black panthers and Indian elephants, amongst other distinctive fauna. The Kali River flows through the tiger reserve and is the lifeline of the ecosystem and hence the name. The Tiger reserve is spread over an area of 1300 square kilometers. ==History== The forest in the area was declared the Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary on 10 May 1956. The state proposed carving out a section of the sanctuary to form the Anshi national park, and the proposal was implemented on 2 September 1987.Wildlife Institute of India Protected Areas in Karnataka state , (June 2000), URL accessed 2 April 2007 The initial proposal covered 250 square kilometres. When the final notification of the park area was issued in 2002, it was extended by another 90 square kilometres. It was renamed to Kali Tiger Reserve in Dec 2015. The park is home to several hydroelectric dams and a nuclear power station. ==Renaming of Anshi Tiger Reserve== It is notable that Anshi National Park and Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary were together granted the status of Project Tiger tiger reserve, being declared as 'Anshi Dandeli Tiger Reserve' in January, 2007. The Anshi park adjoins the Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary, and together with six adjacent protected areas in the states of Goa and Maharashtra, forms an almost uninterrupted protected forest area of over . In December 2015, Dandeli Anshi Tiger reserve was renamed to Kali Tiger Reserve(JOIDA). The river Kali is the lifeline of the people of Uttara Kannada district and integrates Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary (DWS) spread across 400 km2 and Anshi National Park (ANP) spread across 500 km2. The river cuts across the whole park and the renaming has given the area a single identity. The change of name was also to bring focus and awareness to Kali River (Karnataka). The name change was prompted following a universal response from policymakers after the release of the movie Kalikali rename which brought to importance the role of Kali River to the ecosystem. ==Geography== Located in the Western Ghats range from l4°54' to l5°07' N latitude and 74°l6' to 74°30’ E longitude, Kali Tiger River's elevation varies from above MSL.

While it is attributed to Elfman, it is generally considered to be the fourth album by Elfman's band Oingo Boingo. This album marked the first release with MCA records after leaving IRS Records. ==Production== So-Lo features notably more electronic production than previous albums released by Oingo Boingo but retains the prominence of Steve Bartek's electric guitar. The album was produced during a hiatus for Oingo Boingo, following the departure of bassist Kerry Hatch and keyboardist Richard Gibbs. During this time of uncertainty, Elfman created So-Lo to explore different songwriting styles to what the band had been known for, describing it as \\"a chance to experiment with slower tempos.\\"The Elfman Zone - Denver Post Article 1986 Elfman concluded that So-Lo was \\"much more laid-back than an Oingo Boingo album\\" and added that \\"it was fun to do some ballads and try to snap out of that image that a lot of people have of me just writing real fast ... tunes.\\" Despite rumors of the band breaking up, Elfman stated in 1985 that So-Lo was \\"not made out of frustration\\" and that he was more committed to the group than ever before. Conversely, a 1987 article published in BAM magazine, in which Elfman was interviewed about the band's past, suggested that Oingo Boingo had in fact considered disbanding in 1984. Sources also claim that the album was released under Elfman's name to circumvent a dispute with the band's record label, having recently moved from A&M; Records to MCA Records. Oingo Boingo's remaining members returned as session musicians and all feature on the record, with Flea of the then-recently formed Red Hot Chili Peppers providing \\"additional bass guitar\\". The track \\"Lightning\\" had been recorded in 1983 for Good For Your Soul while Hatch and Gibbs were still with the band, hence they are also credited on the album. ==Release== Initial pressings of the album included a different mix of the opening song, \\"Gratitude,\\" featuring a longer, faded-out ending and a spoken word verse that went missing on subsequent releases. The single release and accompanying music video used a revised mix of the song, which was subsequently issued on all repressings of So-Lo. The original mix was also released on the Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack compilation in 1984.Beverly Hills Cop I 07.

The short was produced at the request of Samuel Goldwyn and first shown to accompany the 1942 feature film The Pride of the Yankees. ==Synopsis== Goofy takes the time to demonstrate America's national pastime, then plays a game - one in which he plays all the bases. The short describes the basics of baseball in humorous terms; the equipment, uniforms, positions, and pitches, as well as the mannerisms of the players. It then switches to a game in progress, a deciding game in the World Series between the fictional Blue Sox and Gray Sox (possibly a parody of the real-life Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox). The Blue Sox are up three runs and working a no-hitter when the Grays rally in the bottom of the ninth. In a series of events the Grays load the bases, leading to a base clearing hit. The game is tied, but the play at the plate is too close to call for the umpire, and it then ends in an argument. They unmask the umpire (yet another Goofy!) and the other players attack the three. The narrator then concludes the short praising the values of what makes baseball America's sport. ==Production== This is the first of Disney's “How to...” shorts starring Goofy. The short was made on a rushed schedule of 12 weeks so it could be released in time to accompany Samuel Goldwyn's The Pride of the Yankees. It was followed by nine “How to...” shorts in Walt Disney's lifetime: How to Swim and How to Fish; (both also in 1942); How to Be a Sailor, How to Play Football, and How to Play Golf (1944); How to Ride a Horse (1950, originally included in The Reluctant Dragon in 1941); How to Be a Detective (1952); and How to Sleep and How to Dance (both 1953). After Disney's death, the studio produced How to Haunt a House (1999) and How to Hook Up Your Home Theater (2007). Similarly-styled Goofy shorts that do not include the “How to” titling convention are The Olympic Champ (1942), Hockey Homicide (1945), Goofy Gymnastics (1949) and Motor Mania (1950).

He is a leading member of the Agrarian Party of Russia, and a member of the State Duma, the Russian parliament. In 2004 he ran for the office of president of Russia in the presidential elections. His candidacy was supported by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF). He came second, with 13.7% of the votes cast. He is married with four daughters. ==Presidential campaign== Kharitonov was the Communist Party's nominee in the 2004 Russian presidential election. He was perceived to be a weak candidate, lacking in both name recognition and charisma. Russians were largely indifferent or unaware of his candidacy. His campaign slogan was “For the native land and the popular will\\". He spoke frequently of the virtues of Leninism. Kharitonov also regularly made antisemitic remarks. Kharitonov proposed re-erecting the statue of Soviet secret police founder Felix Dzerzhinsky which formerly stood in front of the Lubyanka Building until it was pulled down in 1991. Kharitonov was strongly supported by Gennady Zyuganov. Many of Kharitonov's advertisements featured Zyuganov speaking on behalf of his candidacy. Zyuganov had originally wanted for the party to abstain from participating in the elections, however he could not coalesce the party in agreement on non-participation and ultimately supported Kharitonov. Some in the party had hoped that Kharitonov would withdraw during the course of the election campaign in order to protests what the party considered to be the \\"undemocratic nature\\" of the election. Putin's camp believed that Kharitonov's candidacy benefited their cause by helping to increase turnout and weakening Sergey Glazyev's vote share. The Communist Party had been besieged by fierce opposition ads during the preceding legislative election in 2003. However, Kharitonov escaped similar opposition ads, as Putin's campaign did not see him as much of a threat. At one point Kharitonov threatened to drop out of the race if he did not receive live coverage for one of his speeches just as Putin had for his Moscow State University address. After this, the RTR television network agreed to broadcast live coverage of a speech Kharitonov gave to his supporters in Tula on March 4. ==References== Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the State Duma (Russian Federation) Category:Communist Party of the Russian Federation members Category:Communist Party of the Soviet Union members Category:Agrarian Party of Russia politicians Kharitonov Kharitonov Category:21st-century Russian politicians ","title":"Nikolay Kharitonov"},{"id":"3227345","text":"Carl Eduard Adolph Petzold (14 January 1815 - August 1891) was a German landscape gardener. == Life == Petzold was born in Königswalde (Lubniewice), Brandenburg.

After college, Congressman Sarbanes served for seven years with the Maryland State Department of Education, working on Maryland’s public school system. He later clerked with Baltimore Judge J. Frederick Motz on the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. Sarbanes spent his professional legal career at the law firm of Venable LLP in Baltimore from 1989 to 2006, where he was chair of health care practice from 2000 to 2006 and a member of the hiring committee from 1992 to 1996. ==U.S. House of Representatives== ===Committee assignments=== *Committee on Energy and Commerce **Subcommittee on Energy **Subcommittee on Health **Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations *Committee on Oversight and Reform **Subcommittee on Government Operations ===Caucus memberships=== *Armenian Caucus *Congressional Public Service Caucus (Co-Chair) *House Congressional Hellenic Caucus *United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus *Joint Congressional Human Rights Caucus *Pakistan Caucus *Congressional Arts Caucus *Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus ===Environmental education=== Congressman Sarbanes has introduced H.R. 2054, the No Child Left Inside Act (NCLI). This Act seeks to both improve education in the nation's public schools and to protect the environment by \\"creating a new environmental education grant program, providing teacher training for environmental education, and including environmental education as an authorized activity under the Fund for the Improvement of Education.\\" NCLI also requires states that participate in the environmental education grant programs to develop a plan to ensure that high school graduates are environmentally literate. This legislation is supported by a \\"coalition of over 1200 local, regional, and national organizations representing millions of concerned citizens who are anxious to see a new commitment to environmental education.\\" === Good-government reforms === After the mid-term elections in November 2018, the Democratic Party unveiled as its first House bill for the 116th Congress. The bill was primarily authored by Sarbanes. The bill would enable small-dollar public funding of congressional elections, sought to establish automatic national voter registration, as well as expand early and online voter registration, and provide greater federal support for state voting systems. The bill proposed banning members of Congress from serving on corporate boards, and called for requiring political advocacy groups to disclose donors.

Sarbanes won the nomination on September 12, 2006 with 31.9% of the vote. His Republican opponent in the general election was Annapolis marketing executive John White. However, the 3rd is a heavily Democratic district that has been in that party's hands since 1927, and few expected Sarbanes to have much difficulty in the election. Sarbanes also benefited from name recognition; his father represented the district from 1971 to 1977. On November 7, 2006, Sarbanes won the general election with 64% of the vote, while White received 34% of the vote and Libertarian Charles Curtis McPeek received 2%.

He has worked with artists such as label mate Ray Luv, Tupac Shakur and Mac Dre. Young Lay was becoming popular when a 1995 attempt was made on his life when he was shot in the head while stopped at a Vallejo traffic light as a passenger in a friend's car. Although critically injured, Young Lay survived and went on to resume rapping after extensive therapy for brain damage in which he had to learn to speak again. On May 17, 1996, Young Lay's infant son Le-Zhan Williams was kidnapped when two teenage girls entered the home of Daphne Boyden, the rapper's 17-year-old girlfriend and mother to his newborn son, killed her, abducted the infant, and set the home on fire in an attempt to cover up the crime. The case went unsolved for 6 years, and was featured on the television shows America's Most Wanted and Unsolved Mysteries. In November 2002 an anonymous tip called in to Vallejo police led to the arrest of Latasha Brown, one of the killers, who had been raising the abducted infant as her own, along with her mother, Delores Ann Brown, who was also arrested. They were still living in Vallejo, not far from where Daphne Boyden was murdered. Latasha Brown's cousin Ocianetta Williams was identified as the second teenage girl responsible for the murder and abduction and both were arrested by the Vallejo Police Department. The then 6-year-old Le-Zhan was reunited with family soon after their arrest. Young Lay was sentenced to a 12-year prison sentence for a 1999 armed robbery.

Team captains Ice Box Bertino and Fearless Ferguson are rivals who brutally fight each other and incur a penalty before the game can begin, sending both of them to the penalty box; subsequently, they are constantly released from the box only to be sent back to it as they cannot help but fight each other on the ice.

After moving to Toronto in 1984 he began presenting his songs on acoustic guitar using an array of effect pedals. From 1984 to 1988 he independently released six album length cassettes of original songs.

In the early 80's he was an active member of the Niagara Artist's Centre in St Catharines, participating in solo and group shows, and exchanges with other artist-run centres. He represented the N.A.C at the annual meeting of the Association of National non-profit Art Centres in 1983. In 1986 he exhibited a series of large-scale works on paper at the Trent University Gallery in Peterborough, and later that year sold a piece to the Canada Council Art Bank, which remains in their permanent collection. By the 90s Swinghammer shifted to commercial projects, and his output of personal work was limited. In 2006 he had a solo show at the Queen Street design space Inside Modern Living which reinvigorated his painting practice. Swinghammer currently exhibits at INabstracto in Toronto and the True North Gallery in Waterdown, Ontario. == Commercial art career == In 1985 Swinghammer did a mural at Toronto's Nutz & Boltz disco, followed by a mural at the Dance Cave, which appears in a scene in 1988's Cocktail starring Tom Cruise. He was associated with a colourful \\"neo-primitive\\" graphic style shared by a few other \\"street artists\\" and which became part of the visual identity of the Queen Street West scene. Over a period of five years Kurt created popular fundraising T-shirt designs and posters for the legendary community radio station CKLN. Commercial projects of note from this period were posters, shopping bag design, and an in-store font for Sam the Record Man (the largest record chain in Canada at the time), designing the Canada Booth for the New Music Seminar in New York City, and designing the CASBY Award logo and set design for CFNY FM. Additional clients for his illustration and design work included Much Music, The Music Gallery, CBC Variety Recordings, Coach House Press, Environment Canada, The Art Gallery Of Ontario, HMV, BMG, Jane Siberry, and Jell-O Pudding. Kurt's illustrated/designed album covers include The Shuffle Demons, David Wilcox (which received a Juno nomination for best album design – a collaboration with Michael Wrycraft), African Guitar Summit, Don Ross, and the children's entertainers Sho, Mo and the Monkey Bunch. In the late 80's Kurt added his signature visual style to numerous music videos, and art directed Out of My House Roach by the Shuffle Demons, and Let Your Backbone Slide and Drop The Needle (which received Juno and Much Music Awards) by pioneering Canadian rap artist Maestro Fresh Wes. These videos were extremely popular on Much Music, and the national exposure created opportunities for Kurt to art direct rap-oriented TV commercials. Swinghammer has created performing wardrobe for the Shuffle Demons, a cappella quartet The Nylons, and jugglers The Flying Dutchmen. He has created set designs for theater director William Scoular and Canadian contemporary dance icon Peggy Baker. In 2008 he did an art instruction residency at The National Ballet School. In 1996 Kurt illustrated the children's book My Stompin’ Grounds – The Songs of Stompin Tom Connors, published by Doubleday. Swinghammer animated the music video for Buffy Sainte-Marie's song \\"The War Racket\\" which was released on her Medicine Songs album. ==References== ==External links== * Kurt Swinghammer Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Canadian singer-songwriters Category:Canadian guitarists Category:Musicians from Toronto Category:Canadian people of German descent Category:Righteous Babe Records artists Category:Canadian male singers Category:Canadian male guitarists ","title":"Kurt Swinghammer"},{"id":"3227417","text":"Thaumiel (twins of God) is the name of one of the Qliphoth in the Kabbalah, the shadow side of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. It is the shadow of the Sephirah Keter (the crown). While Keter is concerned with the unity of God, Thaumiel represents the dual contending forces, struggling, and it is represented by two giant heads with bat-like wings. The Qliphoth are not the opposite of the Sephirot, but the shadow. They are the chaotic forces that are unleashed when one of the Sephirot is not in balance with the others. Therefore, although Keter is concerned with unity, implicit in its existence is the concept of duality. It is the first emanation from the Ein Sof, the point of consciousness that crystallises out of the vast emptiness. Without the forces of the other sephiroth to balance it, specifically Malkuth below, it would exist as something apart from the Ein Sof, God in his totality. However, since all the paradoxical and contending forces unleashed through Keter find their eventual rest and resolution in Malkuth, balance and the unity of God are maintained. The ruler of Thaumiel is Satan. Satan in legend was the chief of the angels, holding a position similar to that of Kether. According to Islamic legend, after God created man, Satan and his angels refused to bow down before Adam. Ralph Austin describes that in the thought of the Islamic mystic, Ibn Arabi, the diabolical principle is that \\"which resists the Self-Realizing urge to create the own-other object (creation) and insists in the sole right of pure spirit and transcendence, this being the reason for Satan's refusal to obey God's command to prostrate himself to Adam, from jealousy for the integrity of pure spirit\\". Seeing this in a kabbalistic way, this means the refusal of Kether, the pure spirit, to find completion and self-realisation through the act of emanation and creation, terminating in Malkuth. Satan therefore represents spiritual pride and arrogance. \\"Second, it is also that principle which insists on the separate reality of cosmic life and substance and which denies all primacy to the Spirit. In other words, it is that principle which would seek to insist on the separate reality of either pole, at the expense of the other, and thus to impair the original wholeness of the divine experience as the Reality by trying to sever the all-important link between \\"own\\" and \\"other\\" and consign each to mutually exclusive isolation in absurdity\\". Which neatly fits with the kabbalistic description of Satan as the master of 'The Dual Contending Forces'. ==In popular culture== In the SCP Foundation mythos and related games, \\"Thaumiel\\" is an esoteric object class, used for objects that do not fit into one of the three major classifications for anomalous objects or entities. Specifically, the \\"Thaumiel\\" classification denotes objects or entities that are used to contain other anomalous objects or entities. ==References== # The Bezels of Wisdom, Ibn Al'Arabi, translation and commentary by Ralph Austin (1980).

Rajgarh in Madhya Pradesh is one of the aspirational districts selected by Government of India. The district has an area of 6,154 km² and the population is 1,545,814 (2011 census).http://www.census2011.co.in/census/district/309-rajgarh.html The district lies on the northern edge of the Malwa plateau, and the Parbati River forms the eastern boundary of the district, while the Kali Sindh River forms the western boundary. The district has seven tehsils, Rajgarh, Khilchipur, Jirapur, Biaora, Narsinghgarh, Sarangpur and Pachore. The district is bounded by Rajasthan state to the north, and by the districts of Guna to the northeast, Bhopal to the east, Sehore to the southeast, and Shajapur to the south and west. It is part of Bhopal Division. There are 1728 villages in Rajgarh. The district was created May 1948, and includes the territory of the former princely states of Rajgarh, Narsinghgarh, Khilchipur, and parts of the states of Dewas Junior and Senior (Sarangpur tehsil) and Indore (Jirapur tehsil, now part of Khilchipur tehsil). In addition to the town of Rajgarh, Khilchipur, Kotravihar Narsinghgarh and kurawar are places of interest. ==Topography== The District lies on the northern edge of the Malwa plateau, and the Parvati River forms the eastern boundary of the district, while the Kalisindh River forms the western boundary. Black soil, light red and core sands are the main soil type available in the district. Soil and cropping pattern :- The first and the most predominant black cotton soil known as kalmat (black soil) or chikat-kali (deep black) are highly fertile with great power of retaining moisture and bears excellent kharif and rabi crops with or without irrigation. Besides suitability, the black soil yields excellent wheat, gram, jowar and cotton crops high in quality and cotton crops high in quality and quantity. #Solar Power plant It is situated in Jaitpura and Ganeshpura villages . NTPC's 50 MW Rajgarh solar power project in Madhya Pradesh, is the biggest solar photovoltaic plant in the country using domestically manufactured modules. The 50 MW plant in Rajgarh, which was set up by Tata Power Solar. ==History== The district takes its name from the headquarters town Rajgarh. Rajgarh District was constituted after the formation of Madhya Bharat in May, 1948. Prior to this the area of the present District was parceled out among the States of Rajgarh, Narsinghgarh, Khilchipur, Dewas (Senior) Dewas (Junior) and Indore. Rajgarh was the headquarters of a mediatised State, ruled by the Umat Rajputs and branch of the great paramara clan, they enjoyed a Sanad Estate under the Sultans of Delhi and Mughal emperors in succession. The first capital was Duparia, now in Shajapur District. Later on it was shifted to Dungarpur (19 km from Rajgarh) and then to Ratanpur (19 km west of Narsinghgarh) and back. In order to avoid disturbance by the frequently passing Mughal armies, the Ruler of the Estate, Mohan Singh, acquired the present side, originally known as Jhanjhanipur from the Bhils in A.D. 1640. Finally he shifted the headquarters in the year 1645, giving the place its present name. During the reign of Akbar (1556–1605) a Khilat and a Sanad were granted to Udaji of Tatanpur. At that time, Sarangpur was a Sarkar in the Subah of Malwa. Its jurisdiction extended from the western part of present Sehore District to the eastern part of Ujjain District. Among its twentyfour mahals many have retained their original names and are identified as Ashtah, Talain (Talen), Agra (Agar), Bajilpur (Bijilpur), Bhorsah, Khiljipur, Jirapur, Sarangpur, Sondarsi (Sundarsi), Sosner (Sunner) Sajapur, Kayath and Navgam (Tarana)1. In 1908, Rajgarh State was divided into seven Parganas, namely Newalganj, Biaora, Kalipith, Karanwas, Kotra, Seogarh and Talen. Narsinghgarh State was divided into four Parganas, namely Huzur (Narsinghgarh), Pachor, Khujner and Chhapera. The Parganas were placed in the charge of a Tahsildar each for revenue matters and magisterial work. 2 Khilchipur State was divided into three Paraganas. Sarangpur was as now, the tehsil headquarters of Dewas (Senior) and Dewas (Junior) States. Jarapur was a tehsil of Mahidpur District of former Indore State. It has now been abolished and merged in Khilchipur tahsil. In 1645 with the permission of Rajmata, Deewan Ajab Singh defeated the Bhils in the hilly region of Rajgarh and he constructed a Palace in 1745 which was having five main gates namely, Itwaria, Bhudwaria, Surajpol, Panradia and Naya Darwaja. And it constitutes three very ancient temple namely Raj Rajeshwar Temple, Chatubhujnathji Temple and Narsingh Temple, and in which Rajmata and his 15-year-old son Rawat Mohan singh was living safely. In Jhanjherpur which was capital and it is having a palace due to which this place is known as Rajgarh and it had become famous. ==Economy== In 2006 the Ministry of Panchayati Raj named Rajgarh one of the country's 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640). It is one of the 24 districts in Madhya Pradesh currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF). Rajgarh is one of 100 district of NITI Ayog's Aspirational district Program. ==Demographics== According to the 2011 census Rajgarh District has a population of 1,545,814, which is more than that of nations like Swaziland or Mauritiushttps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html This gives it a ranking of 322nd in India (out of a total of 640).http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php The district has a population density of .

The Mohanpura dam site is located in Mohanpura Village of Biaora tehsil of Rajgarh. ==Climate== The district has dry climate except in the south-west monsoon season. The year may be divided into four seasons. The period from March to the second week of June is the summer season. The succeeding period up to the end of September is the south-west monsoon season. October and November constitute the postmonsoon or retreating monsoon season. The cold season is from December to February. The annual rainfall in the district is 813.6 mm. About 93 percent of the annual rainfall in the district is received during the monsoon June to September.

Every year lakhs of peoplevisit at Tirupati Dev, situated in south of India. One of the devotee from Zirapur, District Rajgarh of M.P. is Shri Om Prakash Mundra & his wife Shakuntala. When this couple reached to have darshan of Tirupati Balajee, a thought came in their mind, why not build the similar grand temple in Zirapur. It was a dream of Late Shri Kishanjee Mundra, resident of Baikunth and father of Shri O.P. Mundra to have such a grand temple at Zirapur also. Mundra couple then & their determined to construct the grand temple at Zirapur and returned to home town. Later they went with their other family members to Jhalariya Peeth situated at Didwana, (Rajasthan) and met Shree 1008 Shree Swami Shri Ghanshyamacharyajee Maharaj to detail about their dream. Swamijee immediately gave his consent for this great work. The starting was with the formation of Shree Shridhar Gyan Prasar Parmarthik Trust under the guidance of Swamijee Maharaj. Thereafter on 3 September 1998 at Zirapur, a town of Shri S.K. MLmdra with a small population of 25000 people, foundation of Balaji Temple was laid by Swami Shree Ghanshyamacharyajee Maharaj. The construction of temple took about 2 years. From 29 April to 4 May 2000 Pran Pratishtha Samaroh was conducted and Vyankatesh Lord Balajee temple was opened for public, and since then every day 2000–2500 devotees come here to have darshan and-get their will fulfilled. http://zirapurvasagovinda.com/introduction-2/ thumb === Jalpa Mata Temple === A famous temple of maa durga situated 6 km from rajgarh city on the top of the hill.

It was first found in the essential oils of Humulus lupulus (hops), from which it derives its name.Glenn Tinseth, \\"Hop Aroma and Flavor\\", January/February 1993, Brewing Techniques. Accessed July 21, 2010 Humulene is an isomer of β-caryophyllene, and the two are often found together as a mixture in many aromatic plants. ==Occurrence== Humulus lupulus Humulene is one of the components of the essential oil from the flowering cone of the hops plant, Humulus lupulus, from which it derives its name. The concentration of humulene varies among different varieties of the plant but can be up to 40% of the essential oil. Humulene and its reaction products in the brewing process of beer gives many beers their “hoppy” aroma. Noble hop varieties have been found to have higher levels of humulene, while other bitter hop varieties contain low levels. Multiple epoxides of humulene are produced in the brewing process. In a scientific study involving gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of samples and a trained sensory panel, it was found that the hydrolysis products of humulene epoxide II specifically produces a “hoppy” aroma in beer. α-Humulene has been found in many aromatic plants on all continents, often together with its isomer β-caryophyllene. Proven α-humulene emitters into the atmosphere are pine trees, orange orchards, marsh elders, tobacco, and sunflower fields. α-Humulene is contained in the essential oils of aromatic plants such as Salvia officinalis (common sage, culinary sage), Lindera strychnifolia Uyaku or Japanese spicebush, ginseng species, up to 29.9% of the essential oils of Mentha spicata, the ginger family (Zingiberaceae), 10% of the leaf oil of Litsea mushaensis, a Chinese laurel tree, 4% of the leaf extract of Cordia verbenacea, a bush in coastal tropical South America (erva baleeira), but with 25% trans-Caryophyllene and is one of the chemical compounds that contribute to the taste of the spice Persicaria odorata or Vietnamese coriander and the characteristic aroma of Cannabis. ==Preparation and synthesis== Humulene is one of many sesquiterpenoids that are derived from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). The formation of humulene from FPP is catalyzed by sesquiterpene synthesis enzymes.Moss, G.P., \\"Humulene derived sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis.\\" International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Enzyme Nomenclature. Accessed April 10, 2011. http://www.enzyme- database.org/reaction/terp/humul.html This biosynthesis can be mimicked in the laboratory by preparing allylic stannane from farnesol, termed Corey synthesis. There are diverse ways to synthesize humulene in the laboratory, involving differing closures of the C-C bond in the macrocycle. The McMurry synthesis uses a titanium-catalyzed carbonyl coupling reaction; the Takahashi synthesis uses intramolecular alkylation of an allyl halide by a protected cyanohydrin anion; the Suginome synthesis utilizes a geranyl fragment; and the de Groot synthesis synthesizes humulene from a crude distillate of eucalyptus oil.Goldsmith, David. \\"The total synthesis of natural products\\". Canada: John Wiley & Sons. 1997 pp 129-133 Humulene can also be synthesized using a combination of four-component assembly and palladium-mediated cyclization, outlined below. This synthesis is noteworthy for the simplicity of the C−C bond constructions and cyclization steps, which it is believed will prove advantageous in the synthesis of related polyterpenoids. :left To understand humulene's regioselectivity, the fact that one of the two triply substituted C═C double bonds is significantly more reactive, its conformational space was explored computationally and four different conformations were identified. ==Research== In laboratory studies, humulene is being studied for potential anti-inflammatory effects. ==Atmospheric chemistry== α-Humulene is a biogenic volatile organic compound, emitted by numerous plants (see occurrence) with a relatively high potential for secondary organic aerosol formation in the atmosphere. It quickly reacts with ozone in sunlight (photooxidation) to form oxygenated products. α-Humulene has a very high reaction rate coefficient (1.17 × 10−14 cm3 molecule−1 s−1) compared to most monoterpenes. Since it contains three double bonds, first-, second- and third-generation products are possible that can each condense to form secondary organic aerosol. At typical tropospheric ozone mixing ratios of 30 ppb the lifetime of α-humulene is about 2 min, while the first- and second-generation products have average lifetimes of 1 h and 12.5 h, respectively. == References == Category:Cycloalkenes Category:Sesquiterpenes ","title":"Humulene"},{"id":"3227494","text":"Timo Achenbach (born 3 September 1982) is a German footballer who plays for KFC Uerdingen 05.

He is known for illustrations of children's picture books, especially collaborations with writer Margaret Wise Brown including Goodnight Moon (1947) and The Runaway Bunny (1942). ==Biography== ===Early life=== Hurd was born in New York City to Richard Melancthon Hurd, an economist and mortgage banker, and Lucy Gazzam Hurd. He was educated at St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, then studied architecture at Yale University and painting with Fernand Léger in Paris. ===Career=== Hurd returned to New York in 1933 to work as a commercial artist. There Margaret Wise Brown was an editor at W. R. Scott, as well as a writer of picture book texts. On seeing two of his paintings, she asked him if he would consider illustrating children's books. She wrote a text herself, for what became Bumble Bugs and Elephants (1938) —\\"perhaps the first modern board book for babies.\\" Hurd's next collaboration with Brown, The Runaway Bunny, has been in print continuously since its 1942 publication. Their next book, Goodnight Moon (1947), is considered classic children's literature in North America; by 1990, the total number of copies sold was more than 4 million. In 2007, the National Education Association listed Goodnight Moon as one of its \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\\". In 2012 it was ranked number four among the \\"Top 100 Picture Books\\" in a survey published by School Library Journal. Hurd also illustrated over fifty books written by his wife Edith Thacher Hurd (a friend of Brown's) as well as a children's book written by Gertrude Stein, The World Is Round. Hurd wrote and illustrated the book Run, Run, Run. Hurd died of Alzheimer's disease at a San Francisco hospital in 1988. ===Personal life=== His son Thacher Hurd is also a children's book author and illustrator, and referred in an interview to the \\"wonderful aura of creativity\\" surrounding his father and the Vermont farm that was their home. == Legacy == A doctored/altered photo of Hurd was included in the 60th anniversary republication of Goodnight Moon with a cigarette removed from his hand, an incident of tobacco bowdlerization that caused controversy over publication standards.

The baptism of Cornelius is an important event in the history of the early Christian church. == Biblical account == Cornelius was a centurion in the Cohors II Italica Civium Romanorum, mentioned as Cohors Italica in the Vulgate.Bromiley, Geoffrey W., International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1979, p. 297 He was stationed in Caesarea, the capital of Roman Iudaea province. He is depicted in the New Testament as a God-fearing man who always prayed and was full of good works and deeds of alms. Cornelius receives a vision in which an angel of God tells him that his prayers have been heard; he understands that he has been chosen for a higher alternative. The angel then instructs Cornelius to send the men of his household to Joppa, where they will find Simon Peter, who is residing with a tanner by the name of Simon (ff). The conversion of Cornelius comes after a separate vision given to Simon Peter () himself. In the vision, Simon Peter sees all manner of beasts and fowl being lowered from Heaven in a sheet. A voice commands Simon Peter to eat. When he objects to eating those animals that are unclean according to Mosaic Law, the voice tells him not to call unclean that which God has cleansed.\\"Hieromartyr Cornelius the Centurion\\", Orthodox Church in America When Cornelius' men arrive, Simon Peter understands that through this vision the Lord commanded the Apostle to preach the Word of God to the Gentiles. Peter accompanies Cornelius' men back to Caesarea. When Cornelius meets Simon Peter, he falls at Peter's feet. Simon Peter raises the centurion and the two men share their visions. Simon Peter tells of Jesus' ministry and the Resurrection; the Holy Spirit descends on everyone at the gathering. The Jews among the group (presumably they were all Jews if Cornelius was the first gentile convert, see Jewish Christians) are amazed that Cornelius and other uncircumcised should begin speaking in tongues, praising God. Thereupon Simon Peter commands that Cornelius and his followers be baptized.\\"The Departure of St. Cornelius the Centurion\\", Coptic Orthodox Church Network The controversial aspect of Gentile conversion is taken up later at the Council of Jerusalem (Acts 15). == Significance == In this painting by Gerbrand van den Eeckhout an angel appears to the Roman centurion Cornelius. The angel tells him to seek out St. Peter. The Walters Art Museum. Cornelius was one of the first Gentiles converted to Christianity.Kiefer, James E., \\"Cornelius the Centurion\\", Biographical sketches of memorable Christians of the past, Society of Archbishop Justus The baptism of Cornelius is an important event in the history of the early Christian church, along with the conversion and baptism of the Ethiopian eunuch. The Christian church was first formed around the original disciples and followers of Jesus, all of whom, including Jesus himself, were Galilean, except for Judas, who was Judean. All males in the Judean community were circumcised and observed the Law of Moses. The reception of Cornelius sparked a debate among the leaders of the new community of followers of Jesus, culminating in the decision to allow Gentiles to become Christians without conforming to Jewish requirements for circumcision, as recounted in Acts 15. Certain traditions hold Cornelius as becoming either the first bishop of Caesarea, or the bishop of Scepsis in Mysia.Bechtel, Florentine. \\"Cornelius.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 24 Apr. 2013 ==Commemoration== His feast day on the new Martyrologium Romanum is 20 October. He is commemorated in the Orthodox tradition on 13 September.

On May 7, 2019, the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority made TxTag compatible with the PikePass system used on all of Oklahoma's turnpikes. NationalPass provides interoperability with systems outside Texas. TxTag transponders are currently not accepted at tolled border crossings with Mexico, although future interoperability is planned with the Laredo Trade Tag accepted at four crossings. TxTag is not compatible with transponders from the E-ZPass system, although the two companies have been in talks with each other. ==Technology== TxTag uses at least two types of transponders manufactured by TransCore: legacy hard case AT5100 transponders and newer eGo Plus flexible sticker-type transponders. The transponders are mounted on the inside of the vehicle at the top center of the windshield. The TxTag sticker can be used as a portable device, provided it is affixed to a small square of glass instead of a windshield.

His father was the composer and educator Mikuláš Moyzes. After earlier technical studies, in 1925 he entered the Prague Conservatory, where he studied organ, conducting and composition. He graduated in 1929 and went on to study in the master class of Vítězslav Novák, from which he graduated in the following year with his Overture for Orchestra, Opus 10. It was Novák who directed his attention to Slovak music, the source of his inspiration. In 1929, Moyzes was appointed to the teaching staff of the Music and Drama Academy for Slovakia in Bratislava. He became professor of composition at the Bratislava Conservatory in 1941 and spent a number of years as principal music advisor to Radio Bratislava, until compelled to resign in 1948. On its foundation he was appointed professor of composition at the Bratislava Music Academy, where he taught no less than three generations of Slovak composers. He headed the Academy as Rector from 1965 until 1971, and over the years undertook many important functions in the musical life of his country. He died in Bratislava. With Eugen Suchoň and Ján Cikker, Alexander Moyzes is considered one of the three leading composers of his generation in Slovakia. He succeeded in creating a style of composition that was thoroughly Slovak in inspiration, yet nevertheless took account of contemporary trends in European music, a synthesis that he was to consolidate in his later years. ==Pieces== ===Orchestra=== *Down the River Váh, Op. 26 (1935) *Pohronie Dances, Op. 43 (1950) *Gemer Dances, Op. 51 (1956) *Violin Concerto, Op. 53 *Symphony No. 1 in D major, Op. 31 (1929, rev. 1937) *Symphony No. 2 in A minor, Op. 16 (1932) *Symphony No. 3 in B flat major, Op. 18 (1942) *Symphony No. 4 in E flat major, Op. 38 (1947, rev. 1957) *Symphony No. 5 in F major, Op. 39 (1947–48) *Symphony No. 6 in E major, Op. 44 (1951) *Symphony No. 7, Op. 50 (1954–55) *Flute Concerto, Op. 61 *Symphony No. 8, Op. 64 (1968–69) *Symphony No. 9, Op. 69 (1971) *Symphony No. 10, Op. 77 (1977–78) *Symphony No. 11, Op. 79 *Symphony No. 12, Op. 83 ===Chamber=== *Four String Quartets (Op. 8, 66, 83 and without opus number) ===Piano=== *Jazz Sonata for two pianos, op. 14 ==References== ==External links== *Biography Category:1906 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Slovak composers Category:20th-century classical composers Category:Neoromantic composers Category:Male classical composers Category:People from Martin District Category:Pupils of Vítězslav Novák Category:Prague Conservatory alumni Category:20th-century male musicians ","title":"Alexander Moyzes"},{"id":"3227619","text":"The 2005 diplomatic crisis between Mexico and Venezuela began after the Fourth Summit of the Americas where Mexican President Vicente Fox made veiled criticisms of anti-Free Trade Area of the Americas leaders.O'Grady, Mary Anastasia.

The artist was the grandson of landscape painter Gottardo Piazzoni, though he was essentially a self-taught artist. His work has been exhibited in over 400 one man shows and in museums and galleries over the last five decades. Art scribe Robert Hughes was among Chatham's collectors along with Paul Allen and actor Jack Nicholson. Chatham's work eschewed the narrative tendency of much western art and presented landscapes that stand in intimate relationship towards the human figure even in the absence of it. In the early 1980s Chatham began making lithographs and stood as one of the world's foremost practitioners of that craft. In addition to Lithography, Chatham also produced original oil paintings. His oil paintings currently sell for tens of thousands of dollars, and there was a multi-year waiting list for commissions, but according to his dealers, he preferred printing lithographs as the more challenging art form. (Longtime Livingston residents can recall a time when early in his career Chatham traded his canvases for essential services in a barter arrangement.) Despite being a print, Chatham's lithographs have little to do with modern process lithography, which always starts from a photograph and typically only uses 4 colors. His art lithographs may have 30 or 40 different layers of color, all of which have to be hand drawn on to the printing plate, and the colors selected for the final effect. To see some of the early proofs of one of his prints is to see a study in vivid and unusual colors from which it is almost impossible to conceive of the final subtle shadings and quiet colors. In addition to his work as a painter, Chatham also authored several books. a series of short stories \\"Dark Waters\\" in which he detailed the exploits of his hunting friends, like the author Jim Harrison. The stories were Rabelaisian, vulgar, and exquisitely written (one suspects with a little help from his literary friends). William Hjortsberg disputed this during a presentation in Livingston on 9/12/2008. \\"He is quite a good writer in his own right,\\" Hjortsberg said. They center on hunting, fly fishing, food, wine and life changes. One story centers around preparing roast duck on an annual outing devoted solely to excess. In addition to \\"Dark Waters\\", Chatham authored several books about fly fishing. Many of Chatham's painted works have adorned the covers of Harrison's works. In 2011, Chatham moved from Livingston back to California. He had a studio in Marshall, California. ==Selected bibliography== * \\"Striped bass on the fly: a guide to California waters\\" (Examiner Special Projects, 1977) * \\"Russell Chatham\\" (Clark City Press, 1987) * \\"Silent Seasons: Twenty-one Fishing Stories\\" (Clark City Press, 1988) * \\"Dark Waters: Essays, Short Stories and Articles (Clark City Press, 1988) * \\"The Angler's Coast\\" (Clark City Press, revised, 1990) * \\"Russell Chatham: One Hundred Paintings\\" (Clark City Press, 1990) ==References== Category:1939 births Category:2019 deaths Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:21st-century American painters Category:Artists from San Francisco Category:Artists from Montana Category:People from Livingston, Montana Category:Angling writers ","title":"Russell Chatham"},{"id":"3227640","text":"Sara Craig is a Canadian singer-songwriter.

He was elected deputy on 16 June 2002, for the 12th session of the legislature (2002–2007), representing the 1st district in New Caledonia, but lost his hold on power as a result of the elections of 9 May 2004, which propelled a new party, named \\"Future Together\\" (Avenir Ensemble), into control of government in South Province. ==Conviction for slander== Lafleur, whose fortune stemmed partly from mining interests, reportedly slandered and intimidated Goldman Environmental Prize winner Bruno Van Peteghem over Van Peteghem's efforts to protect the ecology of New Caledonia.http://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/National-Wildlife/News-and- Views/Archives/2002/Little-Scum-Takes-On-Big-Mining.aspx ==Offices held== * 1978–2007 : Deputy * 7 March 1983 – 3 June 1997 : Nouméa Municipal Council Member (New Caledonia) * 28 November 1984 – 29 September 1985 : New Caledonia Territorial Assembly Member * 24 April 1988 – 11 June 1989 : President of the Council for the Southern Region of New Caledonia * 11 June 1989 – 8 May 1999 : President of the Assembly for the Southern Region of New Caledonia * 1999-2004 : Président of the South Province ==References== Category:1932 births Category:2010 deaths Category:People from Nouméa Category:The Rally (New Caledonia) politicians Category:Union for a Popular Movement politicians Category:Deputies of the 12th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic ","title":"Jacques Lafleur"},{"id":"3227658","text":"Twechar is a small former mining village in East Dunbartonshire, Scotland close to the boundary with North Lanarkshire. It lies between the larger towns of Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch. The Forth and Clyde Canal runs close to the village to the north, and closely follows the line of the Antonine Wall. There are visible remains of the wall on Bar Hill and the Roman Fort is a local tourist attraction. ==History== Second Legion from Shirva, Twechar. The etymology of the name is probably ‘causeway or pavement’. Several old documents show Twechar with various spellings including maps by Charles Ross, and William Roy. There is a long history of mining activity in the Twechar locality but it was not until the coming of William Baird & Co. to the area, about 1860, that a close-knit mining community was created. Before that time Shirva was described as having the best farm land in the parish. Several tombstones from a possible Roman Cemetery were found at Shirva House. A legionary slab was also discovered. ==Mining== Pits were sunk at Twechar and Gartshore and a row of workers' houses was built on the south bank of the Forth and Clyde canal, just east of Twechar Bridge. The coal mining industry begun by the Bairds in the 1860s lasted for just over a century. Twechar No.1 Pit, on the north bank of the canal to the east of Twechar Bridge, closed in 1964, while Gartshore 9/11, the very last colliery in the area, was shut down in 1968. Thereafter some Twechar men travelled each day to collieries such as Bedlay and Cardowan in Lanarkshire, until they too were closed, during the early 1980s. Baird & Co. provided rail connections to their local pits at an early date but for many years much of their coal was transported to market by canal boat. During the 1860s the canal company permitted Baird & Co. to place a railway swing bridge over the canal, a short distance to the west of Twechar road bridge, for the purpose of forming a connection between collieries on either side of the canal. As part of the deal the coal company agreed to transport a proportion of its coal by canal although this requirement lapsed early in the twentieth century. However, the swing bridge continued in use until the mid-1960s, its hand-winding apparatus having been made redundant on 1 January 1963, when the canal closed. ==Housing== Old postcard of Barrhill Rows Unsafe Twechar Swing Bridge prior to repair Twechar from the air The original housing provided by William Baird & Co soon proved inadequate and around 1880 the Barrhill Rows were constructed at right angles to Main Street, on its western side. At first there were four rows, supplemented by two more about 1900, by which date the total number of dwellings in the rows was 160. The row nearest the canal included a Gartsherrie Co-operative shop and accordingly was known as the 'Store Row'. Initially the houses had no sanitation and were lit by paraffin lamps. Communal wash houses were provided at intervals along each row. Most of the houses were of the two-apartment (room & kitchen) variety. A great improvement was made in 1925, when Baird & Co. (in response to considerable pressure from the miners themselves, over the years) provided good quality modern housing for their mine workers at Burnbrae, Annieston, Sunnyhill and adjacent streets. There were 200 dwellings in all, some two-apartment and some three-apartment, built in two-story blocks of four. They were provided with bathrooms and electric lighting. When these houses were built the old row on the south bank of the canal was demolished. The Barrhill Rows, however, lasted until 1957. The Baird houses of 1925 are currently being demolished and little remains of Burnbrae, Whitelaw Terrace, Shirva lea and Merryflats ( Nov 09 ). Later housing was provided by Dunbartonshire County Council at MacDonald Crescent (1939), Alexander Avenue (1948) and Kelvin View (about 1955). In the 2001 census, the population was recorded as 1,363, a drop of over 9% from the previous census in 1991. ==Schools== The village also had its own secondary education in Twechar School (now Twechar Primary School) until secondary schools in Cumbernauld and Kirkintilloch opened and secondary age pupils were sent by bus to these schools. Pupils from Twechar Primary now go on to further education at the new state of the art Kirkintilloch High School. The Roman Catholic children are taught at St Agathas in Kirkintilloch for their primary and the new St Ninian's High School, Kirkintilloch for their secondary education. the primary school has an estimate of 70-90 pupils. ==Transport== Twechar railway station on the Kelvin Valley Railway served the village and area from 1878 to 1951. It was named Gavell from 1878 until 1924. ==Redevelopment== The war memorial on Twechar's Main Street. The reopening of the Forth & Clyde Canal, in May 2001, brought with it great opportunities for the development of Twechar, which lies close to the canal's half-way point. Currently the village is undergoing a regeneration, EDC and private enterprise have put forward proposals to build approximately 200+ new houses, older housing stock in the \\"National Coal Board\\" scheme will be demolished from late 2007 onwards if the plan goes ahead. Newer small business units have also been built in the small enterprise park opposite the war memorial, and an application for new housing has been raised with the council for new housing next to Kelvin View (November 2009). As of February 2012, residents have been moving into their new homes at the new Kelvin View housing site near the top end of Davison Crescent, the tenants seem very happy with their new homes. Various new walkways have also been made, in and around the village and the glen. The local leisure centre has undergone an expensive renovation and has been re-titled \\" The Twechar healthy living and enterprise centre.\\" There is also a pharmacy run by M & D Green Dispensing Chemists Ltd. Negotiations to obtain a GP have been ongoing for some time. An area to the rear of the former Masonic Hall (Lodge Barrhill Twechar 1444) has already been developed for boating purposes on the canal, a slipway and floating pontoon are already in-situ, hopefully there will be a community canal boat in place in the near future. ==Churches== There is a Church of Scotland congregation, Twechar Parish Church, which shares a minister with Banton. The Roman Catholic villagers are served by St. John of the Cross Chapel in Twechar. There is also a Church of the Nazarene. ==Roman Tombstones== Several Roman tombstones have been found at Shirva. Several of them have been scanned and videos have been produced. They are sometimes connected with Auchendavy since Wester Shirva Farm is about half way between there and Bar Hill.

He coached at Marquette University (1983–1986), Ball State University (1987–1989), the University of Utah (1989–2004), and Saint Louis University (2007–2012). Majerus' most successful season came at Utah in the 1997–98 season, when the Utes finished as runners- up in the 1998 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. Majerus was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019. ==Early life== Majerus was the son of Alyce and Raymond Majerus, a Kohler factory worker and labor leader who was at one time secretary-treasurer of the United Auto Workers. Rick was raised with sisters Jodi and Tracy. As a teenager, Rick accompanied his father to the civil rights marches in Selma, Alabama, an experience that had a profound impact on him. A voracious reader, his sisters said he read four complete newspapers a day. Majerus graduated from Marquette University High School in 1966. He stayed in Milwaukee, attending Marquette University, where he was the first in his family to attend college. He tried out as a walk-on in the 1967 season and played for the Marquette freshman team. He did not play varsity basketball for Marquette, but stayed on as a student assistant. He graduated in 1970 with a bachelor's degree in history. ==Coaching career== While at Marquette and serving as a student assistant for the Warriors, Majerus began coaching eighth-graders at St. Sebastian Grade School in Milwaukee, then coached freshmen boys at Marquette University High School. ===Marquette (1971–1986)=== In 1971, after graduating from Marquette, Majerus became an assistant coach with the Marquette Warriors, where he remained for 12 years, serving under mentor Al McGuire and Hank Raymonds, before taking over as head coach in 1983. He was an assistant under McGuire when the Warriors advanced to the 1974 Final four and won the 1977 NCAA Championship. Longtime NBA player and coach Glenn Doc Rivers played at Marquette and it was Majerus that gave Rivers his \\"Doc\\" nickname. As head coach at Marquette, Majerus led the Warriors to a 56–35 (.615) record and three consecutive NIT appearances in his three seasons. ===Milwaukee Bucks (1986-1987) === After three years as head coach at Marquette, he became an assistant coach with the National Basketball Association's Milwaukee Bucks for the 1986–87 season, serving under Don Nelson. ===Ball State (1987–1989)=== He coached at Ball State University for two seasons where he had a record of 43-17. After a 14-14 initial season, Mejerus led the team to the NCAA tournament in the 1988-89 season. The 1988-89 team holds the record for best men's basketball won-lost mark (29-3) in Ball State University history. He definitely had Ball State's program on the upswing before his departure to Utah in 1989. ===Utah (1989–2004)=== Majerus accepted the position at Utah in 1989. In leading the \\"Runnin Utes\\" to a 1996 sweet 16 match up against Kentucky, Kentucky Coach Rick Pitino had given the opinion that Utah should be favored to win the game. Majerus responded, “if you put the two of us in a sumo ring I’d crush him. On the basketball court, I think we’re in trouble.” Majerus led Utah to the Final Four in 1998 NCAA tournament, eventually losing to Kentucky in the National Championship Game. He was greatly affected by the loss, and claimed to be able to recite the last six minutes of play of the championship game second by second. After the 1998 championship game loss to Kentucky, Majerus responded, “When I die, they might as well bury me at the finish line at Churchill Downs so they can run over me again.\\"Bill Dwyre, Livin’ Large, if All Too Briefly, With Majerus, Los Angeles Times, December 24, 2004, Accessed January 16, 2009 While at Utah, he was known for living out of a hotel room, noting that he liked that \\"There’s clean towels, my bed is turned down every night and there’s a mint on my pillow, no matter what psychological or emotional crisis the maid is going through.\\"Larry Stewart, He Admits to Just One Big Vice, With Relish, Los Angeles Times, December 16, 2004, Accessed January 16, 2009 ====1994 Team USA==== He was an assistant coach under Don Nelson for the US national team in the 1994 FIBA World Championship, winning the gold medal. Majerus left the Utah team after the opening game of the 2000-01 season to rehabilitate his right knee. Intending to return after the first week of 2001, Majerus was hospitalized on New Year's Day 2001 due to chest pains. Later in January 2001, Majerus announced that he would sit out the rest of the season to recover from his own health problems and to be with his ailing mother. He handed over the team to assistant Dick Hunsaker, who guided the team to a 19-10 record and an NIT appearance. Majerus then returned to Utah in the fall of 2001. Majerus was accused of berating and verbally abuse his players. Lance Allred, who wrote about it in his autobiography Longshot: The Adventures of a Deaf Fundamentalist Mormon Kid and His Journey to the NBA, told of his three years at Utah and that Majerus would humiliate him, often targeting his disability—Allred being partially deaf and requiring hearing aids.Lance Allred Allred transferred after the 2001-02 season, but Majerus was later \\"cleared of any wrongdoing.\\"Associated Press, Utah coach cleared of ex-player's allegations, ESPN, January 22, 2004, Accessed January 19, 2010 He left Utah in January 2004 after 15 seasons and a 323–95 (.773) record, in part to get control of his health; he had previously underwent seven vessel bypass surgery to his heart in 1989. Majerus was known to swim for an hour per day in his years after surgery. ===USC resignation (2004)=== On December 15, 2004, Majerus was hired as coach of the University of Southern California basketball team; he was to replace interim coach Jim Saia, who was replacing fired coach Henry Bibby, with Majerus taking over effective April 1, 2005. His contract was scheduled to pay him $5 million over five years.Paul Gutierrez, Floyd Looks Like a Keeper for Trojans, Los Angeles Times, January 14, 2005, Accessed January 16, 2009 Majerus gave an energetic and humorous press conference on the day of his hire, but also noted \\"I hope I die here. I hope I coach here the rest of my life.\\"Bill Plaschke, Laughter Belies a Serious Quest, Los Angeles Times, December 16, 2004, Accessed January 16, 2009 In order to take the position, he needed to buy himself out of his contract as an analyst for ESPN.Paul Gutierrez, It’s a Feel-Good Story, Los Angeles Times, December 16, 2004, Accessed January 16, 2009 However, Majerus unexpectedly resigned only five days later in a somber, and at times weeping, press conference. He apologized to the university and stated that his health and fitness were not yet at a stage where he thought he could perform his new duties, noting \\"I wanted this job so bad I was in denial where my health actually is [. . .] I realized [USC] wasn’t getting the guy they hired. I came to that conclusion myself. I’m not fit for this job by my standards.\\"Mike Terry and Jason Reid, He Just Wasn’t Fit to Be Tied Down, Los Angeles Times, December 21, 2004, Accessed January 16, 2009 Years later, however, Majerus would claim that the true reason for his change of mind had not been his health, but rather had been his mother's request that he not take the job, which would have meant his relocation to Los Angeles, far removed from her home in Wisconsin. ===ESPN analyst (2004–2007)=== Majerus worked as a game and studio analyst for ESPN from 2004 to 2007. Majerus was a fan favorite and cult figure around college basketball, known for his portly, rotund figure and his quirky, jovial personality. He enjoyed bratwursts, a sausage popular in his native Wisconsin. ===Saint Louis (2007–2012)=== On April 27, 2007, Majerus accepted the head coaching position at Saint Louis University; his contract was for six years. His tenure at SLU got off to a rocky start; in their first conference game, the Billikens set an NCAA Division I record for fewest points scored in a game in the modern era of college basketball, losing 49-20 to George Washington. However, as he had done previously at other programs, Majerus eventually made SLU a winning program. In 2012, he led the Billikens to their first NCAA Tournament in 12 years, and their first appearance in a major poll in 17 years. On August 24, 2012, Majerus announced he would not coach the 2012–13 season due to serious heart problems. Jim Crews, one of his assistants, took over for him on a temporary basis for that season. On November 16, it was announced that Majerus was retiring when it was apparent that his heart condition would not improve enough to allow him to return.Rick Majerus won't return to SLU. ESPN, 2012-11-16. Majerus compiled a 95–69 (.579) record at St. Louis University and retired with an overall NCAA record of 517–215 (.706). ===Health and eventual death=== For years, Majerus battled health problems due to obesity. He missed all but the first six games of the 1989–90 season, which was his first at Utah, after undergoing septuple-bypass surgery. Then, in September 2000, Majerus had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee but didn't follow a doctor's orders to take a break from basketball; this prevented his knee from healing properly. On New Year's Day 2001, Majerus complained of chest pains and was hospitalized for one week, prompting him to take the rest of the year off from coaching to devote his energies to his health and also to his ailing mother. He returned to coaching in the fall of 2001. Majerus died of heart failure in a Los Angeles hospital on December 1, 2012 at age 64. He had battled heart trouble for most of the time since 1989. A public memorial service for current and former athletes, coaches, students, and members of the Saint Louis and University community was held on Friday, December 7, 2012, at 3:30 p.m. at Chaifetz Arena on the SLU campus. His private funeral service was in Milwaukee's Church of the Gesu, on Saturday, December 8, 2012. Saint Louis University athletic director Chris May said of Majerus \\"His enduring passion to see his players excel both on and off the court. He truly embraced the term 'student-athlete,' and I think that will be his lasting legacy.\\" Utah athletic director Dr. Chris Hill said of Majerus upon his passing, \\"Rick left a lasting legacy at the University of Utah, not only for his incredible success and the national prominence he brought to our basketball program, but also for the tremendous impact he made on the young men who were fortunate enough to play on his teams.\\" ==Personal== Majerus' father, Raymond, died of a heart attack at 63 in 1987. Raymond was a former secretary-treasurer of the United Auto Workers. Majerus was devoted to his mother, Alyce until her death in August 2011, after initially being diagnosed with cancer in 1987. His mother would take factory work to afford to buy her children Christmas presents. Rick affectionately called her Rosie the Riveter. Majerus was married for two years in the mid 1980's and dated the same woman the last 25 years of his life. \\"He's done so much for basketball at Marquette and all through the state of Wisconsin,\\" Chicago Bulls coach Jim Boylan said of his longtime friend. \\"For me personally, he's always been there. He's one of those guys who, if you don't see Rick for a while and when something was going wrong and you needed help, boom, he'd be there. He'd basically give you the shirt off his back, if that's what you needed.\\" After undergoing septuple- bypass open-heart surgery at age 41, Majerus quipped: “They did seven bypasses on me — one for each of the major food groups.” In 2015, Rick's sisters, on behalf of the Majerus family, donated $1 million to Marquette University. The donation founded the Rick Majerus Endowed Scholarship, which will help first- generation students in the Helen Way Klingler College of Arts and Sciences. Rick's sister Jodi said, \\"knowing my mom and dad and the importance they placed on education, and knowing Rick and how he looked at life in general, it feels like a natural thing to do.\\" The Majerus Family Foundation also donated $2 million to the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City toward construction of a children's research center. The Foundation also hosts annual dinners for the homeless in Milwaukee on the birthdays of Majerus and each of his parents. \\"It's funny, sometimes you get around these coaching lifer guys and you think all they know, all they read, is basketball,\\" said Doc Rivers, of Majerus. \\"You got around Rick and you'd find this extremely well read, intelligent and political guy. He was such a contradiction between what you saw and who he was. Clearly if we had done something related to sports, that's Rick, but this really tells the story of Rick.\\" “The thing about Rick was he never wanted to sleep,” said longtime coach Bill Foster, a Majerus close friend. “He wanted to sit in a restaurant, order more food and talk basketball. He was never happier than when he was doing that. ==Awards and honors== * WAC Coach of the Year: 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997 (media), 1999 * District Coach of the Year (1991, 1993, 1995, 1996) * Playboy Magazine Coach of the Year (1992, 1998) * UPI National Coach of the Year (1991) * Basketball Times National Coach of the Year (1991) * Utah Sports Person of the Year (1992 and 1997) * Trademark sweater retired and hung from the rafters at Jon M.

Declared a national park in 1979, it covers an area of about 4.45 km2. It has the status of a national park, but is developed and managed as a modern zoological park, following the guidelines of the Central Zoo Authority. Animals are kept in near natural habitats. Most animals are either orphaned and brought from various parts of the state or are exchanged from other zoos. No animal is deliberately captured from the forest. Van Vihar is unique because visitors access it from a road through the park, and trenches,walls, and chain-link fencing protect the animals from poachers while providing natural habitat. ==History== In the mid twentieth century a number of illegal stone quarries were operational in the area and, being in a serene and beautiful location on the bank of big lake, many commercial organizations were trying to take hold of this valuable piece of land. Realizing the importance of both in-situ and ex-situ conservation of wild fauna, it was decided to provide this area with a legal umbrella under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. A committee of experts was constituted to decide how to make Van Vihar a protected area. In 1983, on the committee's recommendation, the government declared an area of 4.4521 km2 a national park. Out of the 4.4521 km2 of land, an area 3.8839 km2 was government owned land and the rest belonged to the villagers of Prempura, Dharampuri and Amkheda. Compensation of Rs. 23.52 lakhs was paid to villagers to acquire 0.5692 km2 of private holdings. After the constitution of the National Park, the acquired area was enclosed in with stone walls and chain link fences. The first technical document (known as the Management Plan) to manage the Van Vihar was written in 2000 by Jagdish Chandra, IFS, & Ex-Director of Van Vihar. Efforts of staunch protection and habitat improvement measures resulted in its enrichment in a very short period of time. Van Vihar at Sunset The degraded hillock of Shyamla Hill along with private village land was initiated in 1980 and finally notified as a national park in 1983. Funding from the Central Zoo Authority started in 1993-94 and also granted Van Vihar as a medium sized zoo on the same year. With the dedicated efforts of the park management, the area has now been transformed into an oasis of greenery. The area today serves as the green lung for Bhopal City. ==Biodiversity== Indian leopard Van Vihar categorises animals in two categories, captive and herbivores. All carnivorous animals are kept inside enclosed areas and herbivores are allowed to roam freely. ===Captive fauna=== The animals, such as the Bengal tiger, Asiatic lion, Asiatic wildcat, Indian wolf, Sloth bear, Red fox, Indian jackal, wild dog, mongoose, striped hyena, mugger crocodile, gharial, and snakes such as the python are kept in captivity in a system of kraal and enclosures in lines of modern concept of zoo management as per the norms of Central Zoo Authority. All felids and hyenas are fed with buffalo meat, mutton and poultry. Bears are provided with milk, vegetables and fruits to make a balanced diet. ===Herbivores=== Chital Chital, sambar, blackbuck, nilgai, four-horned antelope, wild boar, porcupine, hare, Rhesus macaque, common langur are ranging freely. Normally the grass and other plant species growing in Van Vihar are sufficient for these herbivores. However, in summer when the grass is scarce, green fodder produced in the fodder farm and wheat husk procured from the market is provided as a supplement. In its ponds, Indian star tortoise, turtles, and a variety of fish occur. Van Vihar also preserves animals belonging to endangered species. ===Avian fauna=== Cinnamon bittern The wilderness of park offers an ideal habitat for a number of avian fauna. Till now about two hundred species of birds have been listed in different parts of Van Vihar. Large number of birds frequent this park, especially during winter the migratory waterfowl alight in great numbers in the adjoining extensive wetland of big lake. In the 2010s, the park developed a vulture breeding centre, which initially focused on restoring populations of white- rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis), and long billed vultures (G. indicus). ==Administration== The park is maintained by the Forest Department of Madhya Pradesh. The park administration is headed by a director of the rank of chief conservator of forests and assisted by one assistant director, 3 range officers, 3 deputy-rangers, 4 foresters and 24 forest guards. In addition to these, persons are engaged on daily wage basis, to meet the day-to-day requirement of the animal care and management. Van Vihar administration is promoting cycling in the park; bicycles can be rented inside park gates at either end of the park. Van Vihar is closed on Fridays. ==See also== * Wildlife of India * Wildlife of South Asia ==References== ==External links== * Madhya Pradesh(MP) Tourism Official Government website * Map of Van Vihar National Park * Patna zoo lion Sheru to roar at Van Vihar Category:National parks in Madhya Pradesh Category:Tourist attractions in Bhopal Category:Protected areas established in 1983 ","title":"Van Vihar National Park"},{"id":"3227664","text":"Edward John Whitley is a British financial advisor and philanthropist.

It is the only National park in Bihar. The extensive forest area of Valmikinagar (formally known as BHAINSA LOTAN) was previously owned by the Bettiah Raj and Ramanagar Raj until the early 1950s. Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR) is one of the natural virgin recesses in east India, situated in the north west corner of Bihar. The pristine forest and wilderness of VTR is an excellent example of Himalayan Terai landscape. VTR comprises the Valmiki National Park and Valmiki Wildlife Sanctuary. The VTR forest area covers , which is 17.4% of the total geographical area of the district West Champaran. As of 2018, there were 40 tigers in the Reserve. The name of the district West Champaran derives from two words, Champa and Aranya, meaning forest of Champa trees. Geographically, it is situated between 83°0 50′ and 84°0 10′ E longitude and between 27°0 10′ and 27°0 03′ N latitude. Total forest area comprises about , out of which the Valmiki Wildlife Sanctuary is and spread of the National Park is about area. In the north, the protected areas are bordered by Nepal's Chitwan National Park while the Indian state Uttar Pradesh bounds the sanctuary from western side. Bihar Government is turning 800 hectares of forest in VTR into Grassland making it India's biggest grassland. Recently water resource department has transferred 200 acres of land to various department to build an ecocity. Government of Bihar has also built eco-cottages for tourists which can be booked online. ==Landscape== The landscape of VTR encompasses foothills ranges of Himalayan Sivaliks with mosaic of the cliffs, ridges, gorges,https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/gorge/ hills, streams and valleys; dense forests, open woodlands, grasslands, swamps and riverine fringe. Situated in Gangetic plains bio-geographic zone of the Country, the forest has combination of bhabar and terai tracts. Boulder and pebble deposits by the Himalayan rivers in foothills characterized the Bhabar tract while the finer sediments deposits feature Terai lands. ===Foothills of Himalayan Terai outliers - a continuation of Shivaliks=== Someshwar Hill Range and Dun Hill system with knife-edge ridges and precipitous slopes, cliffs, spurs, gorges, narrow valleys. ===Bhabar - Dun tract=== Older alluvium with sandy soil with variegated clay and loose boulder deposits and artesian flows; lateritic formations on higher contours and newer Alluvium on southern parts with reissuing springs akin to artesian flows. ===Flood plains of Gandak and Burhi Gandak and their tributaries=== Criss-crossing and meandering rivers, streams and rivulets, man-made canals; Swamps and Grasslands. River Gandak forms the western boundary of Valmiki wildlife sanctuary. It enters in India at Valmikinagar(formally known as BHAINSA LOTAN), where two rivulets Sonha and Pachnad joins it, forming a holy confluence ‘Triveni’. The river is called ‘Narayani’ in Nepal. Harha – Masan River system originates from the Valmiki Forests and forms Burhi Gandak River down south. River Pandai flows into Bihar (India) from Nepal in the eastern end of the Sanctuary and meets Masan. All these rivers with their precursor and tributaries namely Rohua, Kotrahia, Manor, Bhapsa, Koshil, Singha, Dhonghi, Ganguli, Dhoram are full of youth and verve. Their cascades in wanton and wayward playfulness while descending from hills ridges and gorges are enchanting.

Sambar, spotted deer, mouse deer, barking deer, four-horned antelope and wild boar are the main ungulates. The nocturnal slender loris could be common but is seldom seen. The Indian giant squirrel and tree shrew are other interesting species. Among reptiles, the most interesting species is the gliding lizard, found in some deep forested valleys. Another important reptile of this national park is the Indian golden gecko. Originally reported from rocky ravines in the Eastern Ghats, the Indian golden gecko was rediscovered from the same area in 1985 File:Pterocarpus santalinus in Talakona forest, AP W IMG 8099.jpgPterocarpus santalinus (red sandalwood) in Talakona forests of Sri Venkateswara National Park File:Artocarpus heterophyllus (Jak Fruit) on Tirumala hills.jpgArtocarpus heterophyllus (jack fruit) at Sri Venkateswara National Park File:Spotted Deer axisaxis at deerpark Tirumala hills.JPGAxis axis (spotted deer) at deerpark on Tirumala hills in Sri Venkateswara National Park File:Wild squirrel.jpgRatufa indica (Indian giant squirrel) at Sri Venkateswara National Park Semnopithecus priam (Gray Langur) at Tirumala hills.jpgSemnopithecus priam (gray langur) at Sri Venkateswara National Park File:(Sus scrofa) Wild Boar spotted at Tirumala hills.JPGSus scrofa (wild boar) at Sri Venkateswara National Park ==Threats== Panoramic view of Sri Venkateswara National Park along the Eastern Ghats near Talakona, Andhra Pradesh The key threats the national park are construction and quarrying. The Andhra Pradesh State Highway Project, is undertaking the upgrade of highways in the state of Andhra Pradesh, and this includes construction of Warangal- Pollacolu road, which passes close to the western boundary of the national park. Another construction is of the Kapil Teertham Dam inside the national park by the Andhra Pradesh Government and the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam. Both these construction projects raise concerns over the potential impact of the road and the dam on the habitat and the wildlife in the sanctuary. Regular forest fires are also a constant threat to the biodiversity and ecological balance in the park. ==References== ==External links== Category:National parks in Andhra Pradesh Category:Eastern Ghats Category:Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams Category:Chittoor district Category:1989 establishments in India Category:Protected areas established in 1989 ","title":"Sri Venkateswara National Park"},{"id":"3227754","text":"South Button Island National Park is a national park located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands off the coast of India, the total area of this protected island is about .

It is well known for the trekking route to Sandakphu that runs through it. ==History== The park was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1986, and was made an Indian national park in 1992. The region had long been used as the trekking route from Manebhanjang to Sandakphu (the highest peak of West Bengal) and Phalut. ==Geography== Political geography: The park is located in the Darjeeling subdivision, Darjeeling district, West Bengal, India. It is bordered on the north by the state of Sikkim and on the west by the country of Nepal. Physical geography: The park is part of the Eastern Himalayas. The Singalila Ridge, which runs roughly North to South and separates Himalayan West Bengal from the other Eastern Himalayan ranges to the west of it. The two highest peaks of West Bengal, Sandakphu (3630 m) and Phalut (3600 m), are located on the ridge and inside the park. River Rammam and River Sirikhola flow through the park. Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivision. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. Sandakphu Tonglu trekkers hut Meghma village on way to Sandakphu Kanchendzonga from sandakaphu ==Human history== The park has no significant history of human settlement. However, small settlements have grown up along the trekking route to Sandakphu and Phalut. There is a reasonably large village at Kala Pokhri, around the lake of the same name. The Singalila Ridge was used as an approach route by the first documented mountaineering team which unsuccessfully attempted to climb Kanchenjunga in 1905. The team was led by Jules Jacot-Guillarmod and the famous occultist Aleister Crowley. ==Natural history== ===Biomes=== Because of the park's range in altitude, it includes three separate biomes, ranging from subalpine to subtropical, and three corresponding ecoregions: * The Eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests ecoregion, of the temperate coniferous forests biome * Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests ecoregion, of the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome * Himalayan subtropical pine forests ecoregion, of the subtropical coniferous forest biome The subtropical biome roughly exists in the altitude range of 1800 to 3000 m, and the temperate biome exists in the altitude range of 3000 m to 4500 m. Typical high altitude vegetation along the trek route from Sandakphu to Phalut ===Flora=== Thick bamboo, oak, magnolia and rhododendron forest between 2000 and 3600 m cover the Singalila Ridge. There are two seasons of wildflower bloom - one in spring (March and April) when the rhododendrons bloom, and another in the post-monsoon season (around October), when the lower forests bloom (Primula, Geranium, Saxifraga, Bistort, Senecio, Cotoneaster and numerous orchids). Sandakphu is known as the \\"mountain of poisonous plants\\" due to the large concentration of Himalayan cobra lilies (Arisaema) which grow there. The plant life has been surveyed in 2001. ===Fauna=== Mammals: The park has a number of small mammals including the red panda, leopard cat, barking deer, yellow- throated marten, wild boar, pangolin and pika. Larger mammals include the Himalayan black bear, leopard, clouded leopard, serow and takin. Tigers occasionally wander into the area, but do not have a large enough prey base to make residence in these forests feasible. Birds: The park is a birder's delight with over 120 species recorded including many rare and exotic species like the Himalayan Vulture, scarlet minivet, kalij pheasant, blood pheasant, satyr tragopan, brown and fulvous parrotbills, rufous-vented tit, and Old World babblers like the fire-tailed myzornis and the golden-breasted fulvetta. The park is also on the flyway of many migratory birds. Reptiles and amphibians: The endangered Himalayan newt frequents the region and congregates around the lakes of Jore Pokhri and Sukhiapokhri and nearby lakes to reproduce. Jore Pokhri and Sukhiapokhri are within 20 km of the park boundary and are protected wildlife sanctuaries. ==Conservation issues== The major issues at the park are trash collection on trekking routes and ensuring minimal damage of flora by trekkers, as flora at such high altitudes tend to grow really slowly. Grazing of yak and cattle from neighbouring villages can also be a problem. Forest fires can be a threat to the park, especially in spring when the accumulated debris from winter can be a hazard. A forest fire swept through the park on 6 March 2006. Even though the national park has a resident red panda population of only about 42(in 2019) members, Project Red Panda (funded by the Central Zoo Authority) chose Singalila National Park for reintroduction of red pandas from its captive breeding program at the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park in Darjeeling, mainly due to reasons of proximity. Two females, Sweety and Milli, were released in November 2004. Milli was killed by a leopard, but Sweety adapted to the wild and gave birth to an offspring - the first such successful re-entry for red panda. The reintroduction was filmed by noted Indian filmmakers Rajesh Bedi and Naresh Bedi. The documentary, named Cherub of the Mist, won the Best Conservation and Environmental Film at the 29th International Wildlife Film Festival in Montana. ==Park-specific information== The park is one of the most popular family camping destination in the Eastern Himalayas. The two seasons to visit the park are in spring (March–May) and post monsoon (mid-September to early December). The park is closed to tourists from 16 June to 15 September every year on account of the monsoons. ===Activities=== Trekking and camping : The trek along the Singalila Ridge to Sandakphu and Phalut is one of the most popular ones in the Eastern Himalayas, due to the grand vistas of the Kangchenjunga range, and the Everest range which can be seen from the ridge, and also for the seasonal wildflower blooms and birding. Treks begin at Manebhanjan which is 51 km (1.5 hours by road) from Darjeeling. The trekking routes inside the national park have 4 legs or stages. * Manebhanjan to Meghma (2600 m): This is a 4-hour trek through the lower forest * Meghma to Gairibans (2621 m): There are two alternative trekking routes. Both go via Tonglu (3070 m) and Tumling (2900 m). The boundary of the national park passes through Tomling and a checkpost is located there. From Tumling, a shorter trail cuts through Nepal and Jaubari (2750 m). * Gairibans to Sandakphu (3636 m): This is a steep 4 hour climb up. Roughly halfway up the climb is the village of Kala Pokhri (3186 m). * Sandakphu to Phalut (3600 m): This is the most pristine stretch of the trek, offering great views of Kanchenjunga and Mt. Everest. It is a one-day trek via Sabarkum (3536 m) covering 21 km. But the main problem of this Sandakphu-Phalut route is there is no water source in between so the trekker have to carry enough water to reach phalut. The descent from Sandakphu can be accomplished in several ways: * Retracing the way back to Manebhanjan. * A steep descent to the village of Sirikhola on the banks of the River Sirikhola, via Gurdum (2300 m), and from there to Rimbik. * There is now a 4WD motorable road to Sandakphu, so one can hire a cab down to Manebhanjan and Darjeeling via Tomling and Tonglu if needed. Concrete roads are made recently. Earlier roads were made by gravels. The descent from Phalut can also be accomplished in several ways: * Retracing the way back to Manebhanjan. * A descent down to Sirikhola along high altitude meadows which have seasonal blooms. The descent is via Sabarkum and the abandoned village of Molley. A further trek leads one to the scenic village of Rimbik, which is motorable. * The most popular descent is via the villages of Gorkey (on the banks of the River Rammam) and Samanden down to the village of Rammam. The trail then leads to Rimbik, and is shorter than the route via Sirikhola. A schematic of trekking trails in the national park Birding: The Singalila National Park is one of the most popular birding spots in the Eastern Himalayas, since it attracts a large number of birds due to its seasonal blooms. Blooming seasons are the best times to see birds. ===Lodging=== Sailung Tea House is a small cozy place to stay while at Meghma. There are two roomed guest houses and trekkers' huts at Tonglu, Gairibans, Sandakphu, Phalut, Kala Pokhri and several other locations in the park, run by the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council. Numerous guest houses and lodging are available at Manebhanjan. The preferred way to visit the park is to stay in Darjeeling and camp inside the national park. ===Approach=== * Nearest airport: **Bagdogra Airport, West Bengal **Gangtok Helipad, East Sikkim district, Sikkim * Nearest railhead: **Narrow gauge: Ghum, West Bengal **Standard Gauge: New Jalpaiguri, West Bengal * Nearest highway: NH 31A (Sivok-Gangtok) passes through Darjeeling (which is 1.5 hours by car from Manebhanjan) * Nearest town: Manebhanjan - the access point for Rimbick and Tumling, the gateways to the park * Nearest city: Darjeeling == How to reach == By road: Singalila National Park is well connected by road. But the roads are circular and the journey can feel like wave motion. The road route from Siliguri Siliguri > Sukna > Rangtong > Kurseong> Tung > Sonada> Ghoom> Manebhanjan > Tonglu - 90 km. By rail: The nearest railway station of is Ghoom Railway Station 31 km from Tonglu (entry point to the Singalila National Park). By air: Singalila National Park is located 13 km from Bagdogra Airport in Bagdogra. That is the nearest airport, but by road it is less than 100 km and takes 3 to 4 hours. ==Films== * Singalila in the Himalaya by George Thengummoottil http://theindia.info/SingaliLaInTheHimalaya Film speaks about the history of Singalila ridge through a 14-day trek. ==References== * Material from the following book: ** ==External links== *Cherub of the Mist, a documentary Category:National parks in West Bengal Category:Protected areas established in 1986 Category:Tourist attractions in Darjeeling Category:Darjeeling district Category:1986 establishments in India ","title":"Singalila National Park"},{"id":"3227801","text":"Bellerby is a village and civil parish in the Richmondshire district of North Yorkshire, England, about south-west of Richmond. The village has one pub, the Cross Keys, a small and historic Anglican church and a Methodist chapel. It is from the market town of Leyburn. Bellerby is approximately north of London. Bellerby is situated above sea level and is surrounded by low-lying hills with an open south-easterly aspect. Moorland is located to the North and the West of the village. Becks are an attractive feature of the village, which boasts many. The residents of Bellerby are also proud of their large population of ducks who thrive in the becks and in the suitable gardens of many friendly residents. The closest big town is Leyburn. ==Population and history== A graph showing the changing population of Bellerby between 1881 and 1961. Between 1870 and 1872 Bellerby was described as : \\"a township-chapelry in Spennithorne parish, N. R. Yorkshire; 1½ mile N of Leyburn r. station\\". According to the 2011 census Bellerby had a population of 364 people. This is an increase of the noted population 130 years earlier in 1881 at 311 people residing within Bellerby. The population of the village decreased to 266 in 1901, proceeding to stay low until 1931 when the population peaked at 370 people. The population then decreased to 318 in 1961 and appears to have remained constant ever since. The population of Bellerby could have decreased in the early 1900s due to a large proportion of people migrating from the UK (and from all over Europe) to America seeking job opportunities and to experience the ever- expanding American cities such as New York. Another reason for the decrease of the village population could be Urbanisation. Because urbanisation offers many job opportunities and the prospect of a better and more fulfilled life within the city many villagers and people who had formerly lived in rural areas of the UK migrated to the bigger cities. Bellerby is mentioned in the Domesday Book. In the book Bellerby was known as \\"Belgebi\\" which derives from Old Norse meaning Berg's farmstead or clearing. The book describes Bellerby as being medium by having a population of 15 households, and the total tax assesd as large (6 geld units). The households are broken down into 13 villagers and 2 smallholders. Bellerby's Value to the Lord in 1066 is noted as £1.6 and its Value to lord in 1086 remains the same. Bellerby had 6 ploughlands (ploughs possible), 1 lord's plough team, 4 men's plough teams and an 8-acre meadow. The Lord in 1066 was Thor. The Lord in 1086 was Enisant Musard. The Tenant-in- chief in 1086 was Count Alan of Brittany. Phillimore reference: 6N104 ==Age structure== A graph showing the population structure of Bellerby during 2011 According to the 2011 census which shows the age structure of the people who live in Bellerby we can assume that this village is affluent and gentrified. As you can see on the graph to the right 24.9% of the people living in Bellerby are aged 45 – 59 and 14.8% aged 65 – 74.< 95.1% of the people living in Bellerby in 2011 were born in England (the remaining people being from Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and other EU countries) which suggests that the people living in Bellerby have no cultural affluence and are traditionally British. The diagram shows the age structure of Bellerby during 2011. ==Dwellings, household spaces and accommodation== In 2011, Bellerby had a count of 193 dwellings within its boundaries. 100% of these dwellings were recorded as unshared. 88 of these dwellings were detached household spaces, 63 semi-detached and 41 terraced with no purpose built flats or apartments. 1 of these dwellings was recorded as a flat, maisonette or apartment as part of a converted or shared house. This suggests that the residents of Bellerby are middle to upper class as many of the households are detached with no apartment blocks in the area. A pie chart showing the percentage of house types in Bellerby in 2011 ==Economics== In 2011 Bellerby had 280 usual residents (aged 16 – 74). 32 of these residents worked part-time, 104 worked full-time, 58 were self-employed, 7 were unemployed, 1 was a full-time student and 70 were retired. This suggests that many of the residents residing in Bellerby are middle to elderly. This data also suggests that Bellerby is an economically stable area with a low percentage of unemployed people. In Bellerby there are 145 usual male residents and 135 usual female residents. 64 of the male residents are employed in a full-time job, and 40 of the females are employed in a full-time job. None of the males in Bellerby are unemployed to stay at home to look after their family compared to 1 female who is unemployed and stays at home to look after family. This suggests that Bellerby has a strong working economy where the majority of residents are employed. 36 of the male residents in Bellerby are self-employed compared to 22 of the female residents. The adjacent diagram shows the percentages of different housing types in Bellerby. ==St John's Church== The church of St John the Evangelist was blessed on 24 March 1874. It has three buildings, the first of the three buildings was built before 1801. The present church was designed to be more colourful than her predecessor, with stained glass windows showing the birth, death and resurrection of Jesus. Bellerby was first documented in the Domesday Book in 1806, and originally in the Parish of Spennithorne. It is recorded that the parishioners of Bellerby and Skeltoncote sent a petition to the Pope in Rome in 1474 (Pope Sixtus IV), asking him to sponsor the use of a chapel in Bellerby for Mass and the appointment by the Rector of Spennithorne of a priest to serve the Chapel, and provided him with a home in Bellerby. In 1847 Belleby chapel was licensed for Baptisms, Marriages, Burials, and this is also when the registers began. After a lot of fund raising on the parish's behalf, the church was restored with a new roof and decoration inside. In January 2006, a carpet was fitted with in St John's Church. ==Weather== A graph showing the average monthly temperatures for Bellerby and the UK during 2012 Bellerby has experienced severe floods across its history, with the most recent floods occurred during October 2012 (said to be the second great flood since the 1930s), and in June 2019. The flood of 2012 occurred due to a months worth of rain falling over a 24-hour period. Consequently, some of the homes in Bellerby were flooded by up to of water. Bellerby's monthly average temperatures for 2012 averaged with those of the UK as a whole as shown in the adjacent diagram. In 2019, Bellerby was subjected to further flooding when the area suffered a 1-in-a-100 year flooding event. ==References== Category:Villages in North Yorkshire Category:Civil parishes in North Yorkshire ","title":"Bellerby"},{"id":"3227806","text":"The Amicable Grant was a tax imposed on England in 1525 by the Lord Chancellor Thomas Wolsey. Called at the time \\"a benevolence\\", it was essentially a forced loan, a levy of between one sixth and one tenth on the goods of the laity and on one-third of the goods of the clergy.Fletcher, A and D. MacCulloch, \\"Tudor Rebellions\\" (5th Edition,2004) p.22 The Amicable Grant should have been levied with Parliamentary authority, but was not, and so the legal framework for its collection was extremely weak. This was partly because it was brought to Parliament by Thomas Wolsey, who was becoming increasingly unpopular. Widespread passive resistance, with a growing threat of armed resistance, meant little money was raised and the project was dropped. King Henry VIII now lacked funds for his war in France and made peace. ==Causes== In 1525 Henry VIII of England wanted to mount an invasion of France (the Great Enterprise) since the King of France, Francis I, had been captured by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Battle of Pavia in 1525. Henry required additional funds of £800,000, so to gain said money Wolsey resorted to the Amicable Grant. The English Parliament was at this time unlikely to support war, since it was proving to be expensive. Furthermore, Henry's previous French endeavours, which had occurred in 1522 and 1523, had proved less than successful. ==Effects== ===Short term=== Trouble was inevitable and indeed, even anticipated, for the Commons were financially exhausted; the forced 'loans' of 1522–1523 had not been repaid and the subsidy of 1523 was still being collected. Archbishop Warham reported on 12 April that he found the Kentish clergy 'not inclined to the grant' and that the heads of the religious houses had answered 'that they cannot contribute as required'. At Ely they said they would gladly sell their cattle and goods 'but no man in the country has money to buy or lend'.Fletcher, A and D. MacCulloch, \\"Tudor Rebellions\\" (5thedn.,2004) p.22 Discontent reached dangerous levels across England. In Essex, Kent, Norfolk, Warwickshire, and Huntingdonshire, the grant provoked reactions ranging from reluctance to outright refusal. It provoked an open rebellion in Suffolk and a taxpayer strike, which spread to the borders of Essex and Cambridgeshire. In the most serious rebellion in England since 1497, 10,000 men converged on the major trading town of Lavenham. An eyewitness reported that the militants only failed because loyal townsmen led by Sir John Spring had removed the clappers from the bells of Lavenham church, which were to have been rung to signal the start of the uprising.Guy, J. \\"Tudor England\\" (1990) p.103 The rebellion was eventually crushed by the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, but the rebels had made their point. Wolsey was forced to abandon the Grant and reduce the payments for the 1523 subsidy. Discontent in London prompted Henry to halve demands to save some of the tax, before abandoning it altogether. At the end of May, the rising's ringleaders were brought before the Star Chamber and pardoned. Wolsey led an ostentatious ceremony of reconciliation, begging the king for pardon for his fellow Suffolk men, even supplying them with more than enough cash to cover their time in gold and a piece of silver.Fletcher, A and D. MacCulloch, \\"Tudor Rebellions\\" (5th Edition,2004) p.23 ===Long term=== Wolsey's climbdown was humiliating, and may have contributed to his fall in 1529 since this was the first occasion in which Wolsey had seriously failed to enact Henry's will. Popular opinion made a significant impact on foreign policy too, reducing considerably the fiscal potential of the Henrician government and forcing Henry to abandon his European schemes; peace with France was the only course, ending significant military endeavours for England until the Scottish campaign of 1542. ==References== ==Further reading== * Bernard, George William.

This protected area is part of the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves since 2009. ==Description== Covering a vast area of 2750 km2 out of which 303 km2 from the core area, thick biosphere reserve is a sanctuary and one of the tiger projects and national parks of India. With a wide range of rainfall and edaphic variations, from dry deciduous to moist green forests, it is suitable to many species of flora and fauna. About 1076 species of mammals, 29 types of reptiles and 231 species of birds are in this plateau. The average mean elevation of Similipal is 900 meters. There are tall sal trees in large numbers. The peaks of Khairiburu (1178 meters), Meghasani (1158 meters) and others welcome. Sweet scented champak flowers freshen the air. The richly hued orchids on the green foliage are soothing. In the midst of the dense forests, the summer stands humbled. Several rivers like Budhabalanga, Khairi, salandi, Palpala, etc. originate from the hills and meander through the forest. Many of them have cascading rapids and foaming falls before leaving for the plains. The panoramic views of the waterfalls at Barehipani (217 meters) and Joranda (181 meters)http://www.similipal.org/destinations.php#5 are enchanting. Fish is found in abundance in most of the rivers. The silence of Similipal is occasionally broken by the chirping of the birds. The dense forest and riverine system serve as an excellent home to some of the most beautiful creatures. ==History== Simlipal elephant reserve originated mainly as a hunting ground for the royalty. It was formally designated a tiger reserve in 1956 and under Project Tiger in May 1973. \\"Mugger Crocodile Scheme\\" was started in 1979 at Ramatirtha, Jashipur. The Government of Odisha declared Simlipal as a wildlife sanctuary in 1979 with an area of . Later in 1980, the state government proposed of the sanctuary as a national park. Further in 1986, area of the national park was increased to . Government of India declared Simlipal as a biosphere reserve in 1994. UNESCO added this national park to its list of Biosphere Reserves in May 2009. There are 10,000 people living in 61 villages in the forest. That is why Simlipal is yet to be declared a full-fledged park, despite its having the status of one of the 18 biospheres of India., p. 111 === Relocation of core villages=== In December 2013, 32 families from the Khadia tribe belonging to two hamlets of Upper Barhakamuda and Bahaghar were relocated outside the Tiger Reserve as per the guidelines set by National Tiger Conservation Authority. The village of Jamunagarh was relocated in September 2015. Following the relocation, tiger sightings in the core area has gone up. There are two villages, Kabatghai and Bakua, present in the core area of Similipal. The Forest Department, wildlife NGOs and local administration have initiated talks with these villages on their relocation. ==Geography and climate== The park is in the Mayurbhanj district in the Indian state of Odisha. Simlipal Elephant Reserve is an ecosystem complete with forest vegetation (mainly sal trees), fauna and the adjoining Ho / Santhal tribal settlements. The park has an area of . The average elevation is . However, the Similipal area is undulating, rising from to .

At least 12 rivers cut across the plain area. The prominent among them are Budhabalanga, Palpala Bhandan, Kharkai River and Deo. This sprawling forest has two prominent waterfalls - Joranda/Jorodah and Barheipani/Barhai that gives a panoramic view to the park. Summers are hot with temperatures around whereas the winter months can be as low as . The rainfall ranges from moderate to heavy.https://mausam.imd.gov.in/imd_latest/contents/rainfallinformation.php Simlipal comes under a high cerebral malaria-prone zone. In cerebral malaria the sequestrated red blood cells can breach the blood brain barrier possibly leading to coma. Cerebral malaria, if not detected, causes death within 15 days of infection. Initial symptoms of cerebral malaria are often mistaken as those of acute jaundice. There have been many recorded cases of death due to cerebral malaria after visits to Simlipal. Therefore, it is extremely important for tourists to be aware of the threats posed by cerebral malaria before planning a visit to Simlipal. ==Wildlife== === Flora === The park is a treasure house of 1076 species of plants belonging to 102 families. 96 species of orchids have been identified here. It lies in the Eastern Highlands moist deciduous forests ecoregion, with tropical moist broadleaf forest and tropical moist deciduous forests with dry deciduous hill forest and high level Sal forests. The grasslands and the savannas provide grazing grounds for the herbivores and hiding place to the carnivores. The forest boasts of innumerable medicinal and aromatic plants, which provide a source of earnings for the tribal people. Eucalyptus, planted by the British during the 1900s, are found., p. 112 === Fauna === A total of 42 species of mammals, 242 species of birds and 30 species of reptiles have been recorded in Simlipal National Park. The major mammals include tiger, leopard, Asian elephant, sambar, barking deer, gaur, jungle cat, wild boar, chausingha (four horned antelope), giant squirrel and common langur. 231 species of birds nest in these forests. Red junglefowl, hill mynah, peafowl, Alexandrine parakeet, crested serpent eagle are the commonly found birds. The grey hornbill, Indian pied hornbill, Malabar pied hornbill and Indian trogon are also found in the reserve. The park has a sizeable population of reptiles, which includes snakes and turtles.

It was written and directed by Ben Elton, with Laurie directing some scenes in an uncredited role, and based upon Elton's novel, Inconceivable. The film was a critical failure, and did not do well at the box office, despite a cast including many of the best-known names within comedy in Britain. ==Plot== Sam Bell (Hugh Laurie) and his wife Lucy (Joely Richardson) are a married couple struggling for a baby, having tried everything they can think of to improve their chances of conceiving. At the same time, Sam begins to find his job (as a commissioning editor of drama at the BBC) increasingly unfulfilling. While he resolves to write his own screenplay, he begins to suffer writer's block. The idea dawns upon him to write about his own predicament, something to which Lucy objects strongly. He uses her diary entries to help him achieve authenticity, and the film is a success. Lucy finds out about the film and, shocked, leaves Sam. Eventually they reconcile, and at the end of the story are still trying for a baby.

Fandango was the first TV game show to air on TNN and was one of the longest-running game shows on a cable network. The show was hosted by singer Bill Anderson, who was joined by Blake Pickett as co-host in 1987. Radio and television personality Charlie Chase has often been identified as the voice of \\"Edgar the Talking Jukebox\\", but Anderson's autobiography Whisperin' Bill names Edgar's voice as being that of Anderson's long-time friend, radio announcer Bill Robinson.Anderson, B: Whisperin' Bill: An Autobiography, page 427. Longstreet Press, 1989. ==Gameplay== ===Main game=== Three contestants (including a returning champion) answered country music questions to win prizes. The returning champion stood behind the blue podium and his/her two challengers stood at red and yellow podiums. ====1983==== In round one, Anderson asked a toss-up question to all three contestants worth 10 points. Whoever buzzed-in with the right answer wagered any or all of his/her score and chose one of nine categories. The center category was always the \\"Star of the Day\\". A correct answer added the wager to his/her score and a wrong answer deducted it. Later in the run, a \\"Secret Square\\" was shown to the home audience, and if chosen, it would double the wager for a correct answer. Gameplay continued until time expired or until all nine categories were used. In round two, toss-ups were worth 20 points but overall gameplay remained the same. Some questions had a bonus prize attached to it, which Edgar would mention prior to the question. ====1987==== The game started with a 10-point toss-up question. The first contestant to buzz-in and answer correctly won the points and chose from one of eight categories for bonus points, worth anywhere from 20–100 points. If the contestant answered the bonus question correctly, he/she won the points. If the contestant was incorrect, whichever opponent currently had the lower score had a chance to answer and steal the points. If the contestant with the lowest score missed, the third contestant was given a chance to respond. If the two opponents were tied, the question became a toss-up between them. Round two was played the same way as round one, except that the point values were now doubled. In the middle of each round, Edgar the Talking Jukebox would interrupt the game, usually with a joke, and then read a question which awarded a bonus prize to the contestant who correctly answered. ====Final Question==== Each round ended with one final question. Originally, it was played for 50 points in both rounds, and all three contestants answered by writing their response on a card. In the second round, 50 points was taken away for a wrong answer. Starting in 1987, if the difference was less than 200 points between two or all three contestants, the final question was worth +/- 100 points. If a contestant led by more than 200 points, the final question was not played since the difference wasn't enough to catch the leader. The contestant with the highest score at the end of the game became the winner, won a prize and advanced to the bonus round. If the game ended in a tie, one final toss-up question was asked. If a contestant hit more than 1000 points in the first four seasons, the podium would read 999, but Bill would tell the contestant's actual score, as the scoreboards in the first four seasons could only display three digits. However in 1987, the scoreboards displayed four digits. ===Bonus Round (\\"Meet the Stars\\")=== In the bonus round, the champion tried to predict celebrities' answers given in pre-taped interviews. Originally, the Star of the Day was the only celebrity featured in the interviews, but beginning in 1987, four different celebrities were featured. Anderson read a question (e.g., \\"When you do a concert or an on-stage performance, what song is most requested by the audience?\\") with two possible answers, and the contestant guessed what answer the celebrity gave. For each correct answer, the contestant won an increasingly valuable prize. If incorrect, the game ended, and the contestant lost all prizes accumulated to that point; however, the contestant could quit at any time and keep what he/she had already won. If the contestant answered all four questions correctly, he/she won the grand prize of a vacation. If the contestant missed the first question, he/she could still win the first prize by answering the question from the second celebrity (no additional prizes could be won), but if they missed the second question, the round ended in a loss, and the contestant was awarded a consolation prize. Beginning in 1987, the champion was shown an eight-numbered board from which he/she selected prizes for the first three questions. For the fourth question, Pickett presented eight sealed envelopes containing the names of different grand prizes, which included cars, a boat, a fur coat, and vacations. After choosing an envelope and revealing its contents, the contestant could elect to risk what he/she had already won in order to win the bonus prize or return the envelope and select a fourth prize from the board without having to answer an additional question. Any contestant who won the grand prize retired from the show. If a contestant won five consecutive days, he/she was automatically awarded the grand prize regardless of the outcome of the bonus round. In some cases, Anderson would participate as the Star of the Day, during which Edgar would host the bonus round. In other cases, during celebrity shows with country music stars, the round was reversed, and the stars would guess what the former contestants responded to various questions. The fans involved won prizes based on how well the star had done in the round. Beginning in 1987, a variety of different stars (which included then-current country stars, country music legends, country-oriented comedians and stars from popular Nashville Network shows) played the bonus round, and Anderson would tell the contestant the star's name to help him or her decide whether to continue or stop. For at least the first two seasons, the show had a celebrity tournament with country stars playing. The show donated a cash prize to charity on each celeb's behalf. The winner of the maingame played the bonus and the prizes went to a civilian, in some cases a former contestant. The winners of the first three games came back on day four for the finals.

The radical initiator system is based on AIBN and tributyltin hydride. The cyclic β-keto ester can be obtained through a Dieckmann condensation. The original reaction consisted of a nucleophilic aliphatic substitution of the enolate of ethyl cyclohexanone-2-carboxylate with 1,4-diiodobutane and sodium hydride followed by ring expansion to ethyl cyclodecanone-6-carboxylate. A side-reaction is organic reduction of the iodoalkane. Dowd–Beckwith Ring Expansion.gif == Reaction mechanism== Dowd–Beckwith ring expansion reaction mechanism The reaction mechanism involves a bicyclic intermediate. The reaction is initiated by thermal decomposition of AIBN. The resulting radicals abstract hydrogen from tributyltin hydride to a tributyltin radical which in turn abstracts the halogen atom to form an alkyl radical. This radical attacks the carbonyl group to an intermediate bicyclic ketyl. This intermediate then rearranges with ring expansion to a new carbon radical species which recombines with a proton radical from tributyltin hydride propagating the catalytic cycle. == Scope == Dowd–Beckwith reaction A side reaction accompanying this ring expansion is organic reduction of the halo alkane to a saturated alkyl group. One study shows that the success depends critically on the accessibility of the carbonyl group. Deuterium experiments also show the presence of a 1,5 hydride shift.

During the medieval period, Belton and Browston were essentially agricultural communities and evidence has indicated that Browston could have been the larger of the two during this time.http://beals.info/genealogy/sources/belton_history.htm#origin There is no mention of a church in Belton at the time of Domesday book. The earliest record of the church is in the time of Henry I who ruled from 1100-1135. Judging by architectural style, the current church building dates form the 1300s with major restoration work taking place from 1837 Rev Revd Francis Howes and his family. The tower was rebuilt in 1849. Belton was affected by the Great Plague of 1665, even though it is associated with London. The parish register lists 13 burials with 7 listed as \\"plague\\". At the time, three or four burials a year was normal. Belton continued as a small farming community and in 1858, Belton Station was opened, giving the village a railway link to Great Yarmouth and London. This helped the local farming industry as Belton became a market garden providing to markets in nearby Yarmouth and as far as London. === Belton at war === Belton Common was used by the Suffolk Regiment for military and training purposes during World War I. As German U-Boats disrupted imports, Belton was used to grow produce with various schemes such as growing potatoes in allotments and gardens.http://beals.info/genealogy/sources/belton_history.htm#origin During World War II the Royal Norfolk Regiment were billeted in Belton with many local people sharing their homes with the soldiers. Belton's most famous incident of the war was when American B-24 Liberator bomber \\"Belle of the East\\" crash landed near Sandy Lane. The crew survived the crash and were aided by the villagers. Belle of the East Way A plaque on the Tavern pub commemorates the incident with a nearby street bearing the name \\"Belle of the East Way\\". Belton hosted evacuees from Romford, Essex and a few settled in the village.

He is known for combining popular, folk, and classical music forms. Schoenfield was born in 1947 in Detroit, Michigan. He began to take piano lessons at the age of six, and wrote his first composition a year later. Among his teachers were Julius Chajes, Ozan Marsh and Rudolf Serkin. He holds a B.A. degree from Carnegie-Mellon University and a Doctor of Music Arts degree from the University of Arizona. Schoenfield was formerly an active concert pianist, as a soloist and with groups including Music from Marlboro. With violinist Sergiu Luca he recorded the complete violin and piano works of Béla Bartók. He gave the premiere of his piano concerto Four Parables with the Toledo Symphony in 1983. Jeffrey Kahane recorded the work in 1994 with John Nelson and the New World Symphony. Also on the Argo CD are Vaudeville, Schoenfeld's concerto for piccolo trumpet, played by Wolfgang Basch, and Klezmer Rondos, concerto for flute, baritone and orchestra, performed by flutist Carol Wincenc. Critic Raymond Tuttle called the CD: \\"Some of the most life-affirming new music I've heard in a long time\\", while he characterized Four Parables as \\"wild silliness in the face of existential dread.\\" Andreas Boyde gave the European premiere of Four Parables in 1998 with the Dresdner Sinfoniker and Jonathan Nott, a live performance which was issued on the Athene Records label in 1999. In 2008 the work was released on Black Box Classics with Andrew Russo and the Prague Philharmonic led by JoAnn Falletta. Also on the CD Russo plays Four Souvenirs with violinist James Ehnes and the piano trio Café Music with Ehnes and cellist Edward Arron. Café Music was commissioned by the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and inspired by Schoenfeld's turn as house pianist at Murray's steakhouse in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It received its premiere during an SPCO chamber concert in January, 1987 with Schoenfeld at the piano. In 1994, the same year he was awarded the Cleveland Arts Prize, an evening of Schoenfield's pieces was presented at Reinberger Hall by violinist Lev Polyakin and other members of the Cleveland Orchestra with the composer at the piano. Cleveland Orchestra principal violist Robert Vernon gave the world premiere of Schoenfield's viola concerto in 1998. Schoenfield's two-act opera, The Merchant and the Pauper, was commissioned by the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis and given its premiere there in 1999. Its libretto is adapted from a tale fashioned and first told in 1809 by one of the most significant personalities in Hassidic history, philosophy, and lore- Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav (1772-1811), the founder of the Bratslaver Hassidic sect. Schoenfield's song cycle Camp Songs was commissioned by Seattle's Music of Remembrance (MOR). It was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 2003.http://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/paul- schoenfeld The song cycle Ghetto Songs, commissioned by MOR, was recorded in 2009 by Naxos. In 2010 Schoenfield's Sonata for Violin and Piano was premiered at Lincoln Center with Cho-Liang Lin, violin, and Jon Kimura Parker, piano. Schoenfield is a Professor of Composition at the University of Michigan. He is also a dedicated scholar of the Talmud and of mathematics. ==References== ==External links== * University of Michigan bio * http://www.milkenarchive.org/artists/view/paul-schoenfield/ * Category:Living people Category:1947 births Category:University of Michigan faculty Category:American male classical composers Category:American classical composers Category:20th-century classical composers Category:21st-century classical composers Category:Musicians from Detroit Category:Carnegie Mellon University alumni Category:University of Arizona alumni Category:21st-century American composers Category:20th-century American composers ","title":"Paul Schoenfield"},{"id":"3227851","text":" USS Walter X. Young (DE-715/APD-131) was a ship of the United States Navy, named for Lieutenant Walter X. Young (1918-1942), an officer of the United States Marine Corps who was killed in action during the Battle of Guadalcanal. Originally laid down on 27 May 1944 at the Defoe Shipbuilding Company in Bay City, Michigan as a , DE-715, Young was reclassified and redesignated as a , APD-131 on 15 July 1944. The ship was launched on 30 September 1944, sponsored by Mrs. John J. McGeeney; and commissioned on 1 May 1945, with Lieutenant Commander Nicholas Biddle, USNR, in command. ==Service history== After conducting shakedown in Guantanamo Bay, Walter X. Young interrupted her voyage to Norfolk, Virginia, when she transported an emergency appendectomy patient from to Guantanamo Bay for medical attention. Upon the completion of this mission of mercy, she arrived at Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 10 June. Post-shakedown availability and training exercises preceded her sailing south for Fort Pierce, Florida, for specialized training with Underwater Demolition Teams (UDTs). She departed the east coast on 30 July for San Pedro, California; transited the Panama Canal on 3 August, and while en route up the Pacific coast of Mexico, received word of the atomic bomb detonation at Hiroshima on the 6th and, three days later, of a nuclear blast at Nagasaki, and of the Soviet Union's entry into the Pacific War the same day. Two days after her arrival at San Diego on 12 August, further welcome news arrived, telling that Japan had accepted the unconditional surrender terms of the Potsdam Declaration and had capitulated. As a result of this development, Walter X. Young's original orders, calling for her embarked UDT personnel to take part in the projected invasion of Japan, were cancelled. Instead, the ship received a different mission. On 16 August, Walter X. Young embarked the 93 men of UDT 22 (Lt. Cdr. J. F. Chace, USNR, in command), and after sunset on that date, sailed for the Hawaiian Islands. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on the morning of 22 August, she fueled and provisioned to capacity, loaded UDT explosives, and got underway on the afternoon of the 23rd for Japan. Her group steamed via the Marshall Islands, arrived in Tokyo Bay on 4 September, and reported to Vice Admiral Theodore S. \\"Ping\\" Wilkinson, Commander, 3rd Amphibious Force. With the group now reconstituted as Task Group 32.2 (TG 32.2), as two further APDs and their embarked UDTs joined, they awaited their assignments. The dock areas at Yokohama, the scene for one of the major initial occupation landings, were found to be in good condition, suitable for immediate use. Thus, they did not require reconnoitering by the UDTs for possible mines or other obstructions. Midway through her stay in Tokyo Bay, Walter X. Young was buffeted about by a typhoon. With high winds and seas, she dragged her anchor and eventually shifted anchorage to the lee side of the bay. During the height of the tempest, the APD received word from the cruiser that one of Youngs boats, an LCP(R) which had been loaned to the cruiser, had broken away and been lost. When the storm cleared however, the \\"missing\\" craft was seen riding at a painter astern of the cruiser and later was recovered intact. On 20 September, the ship's waiting period ended. In company with , Walter X. Young got underway on that date for Aomori, on the northern end of Honshū, to conduct a reconnaissance and beach survey, and to clear any obstacles that might impede Army landings. The two APDs escorted on this short voyage. While en route on the 21st, the American warships sighted a floating mine and sank it with rifle fire. Upon arrival at Mutsu Kaiwan on the 22nd, Gantner proceeded to Ominato to pick up local Japanese officials to assist in the clearance program. Meanwhile, Young proceeded to Aomori, where, with the aid of underwater sounding devices, she located the hulks of three sunken ships. Swimmers from UDT 22 then attached buoys to them, while a fourth wreck also located during the survey was found to have been already helpfully buoyed by the Japanese. On 23 September, UDT 22 surveyed the beach and its approaches, as well as the available exits to the main highway which ran parallel to the beach itself, to the eastward of Aomori. They found nothing which required dynamiting, but did attach buoys to some small wrecks at one end of the beach. They reported that the beach was suitable for all types of landing craft; was capable of supporting vehicles; and possessed several exits to the main road. Placing beach markers and drawing up maps of the area, Walter X. Youngs UDT conducted an additional survey the following day, thus preparing the way for the landings at Aomori which followed on the 25th and continued throughout the day. Detached on the evening of the 25th, Young reported to Commander, TG 32.2, for orders. Anchoring at Ominato on the evening of 26 September, the ship obtained information concerning Japanese minefields still extant in Tsugaru Strait, and the next day, got underway for Niigata, on the west coast of Honshū. Proceeding independently, the ship rendezvoused with a Japanese tug, the Japanese craft carrying two American Army officers who had travelled overland from Tokyo, several Japanese police, and a local pilot, off the port. In an ensuing conference, it was learned that although the Japanese claimed to have swept a channel into Niigata, the width of the channel was too narrow to provide a margin of safety for an occupation force of transports. However, some 15 miles north of Niigata lay Senami. Walter X. Youngs embarked UDT soon surveyed the beach and found it in excellent condition. Nevertheless, any landings should be conducted in calm weather or with a prevailing offshore wind due to the beach's exposed position on the Sea of Japan. Marking and mapping the beach, UDT 22 reembarked in Walter X. Young, and the ship got underway for Tokyo Bay, stopping at Hakodate, Hokkaidō, en route, to pick up an officer from UDT 22 who had served a tour of detached duty there. Walter X. Young dropped anchor at Yokohama on 30 September. On 12 October, she got underway for the west coast of the United States, and steamed homeward via Guam and Pearl Harbor. The ship arrived at San Diego on 2 November, and immediately disembarked UDT 22\\\\. Ten days of availability at the Naval Repair Base, San Diego, preceded the ship's participation in coastwise transportation of Navy and Marine Corps dischargees within the 11th Naval District. ===Decommissioning and disposal=== The ship was decommissioned on 2 July 1946, and placed in reserve at Stockton, California. Struck from the Navy List on 1 May 1962 and stripped of all militarily useful items and equipment, Walter X. Young was towed from her berth with the Stockton Reserve Group to her final duty station, the Naval Missile Center at Point Mugu, California. Subsequently, converted to a test hulk, Walter X. Young was sunk in missile-firing tests on 11 April 1967. == References == * ==External links== * Category:Crosley-class high speed transports Category:World War II amphibious warfare vessels of the United States Category:Ships built in Bay City, Michigan Category:1944 ships Category:Ships sunk as targets Category:Maritime incidents in 1967 ","title":"USS Walter X.

It stretches over an area of , with a buffer zone of . It is part of the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in the Kheri and Lakhimpur districts. It is located on the Indo-Nepal border in the Lakhimpur Kheri District, and has buffers of reserved forest areas on the northern and southern sides. It represents one of the few remaining areas of the diverse and productive Terai ecosystem, supporting many endangered species, obligate species of tall wet grasslands and species of restricted distribution. ==History== Deer in Dudhwa Dudhwa became a tiger reserve in 1979. The area was established in 1958 as a wildlife sanctuary for swamp deer. Thanks to the efforts of Billy Arjan Singh the area was notified as a national park in January 1977. In 1987, the park was declared a tiger reserve and brought under the purview of the ‘Project Tiger’. Together with the Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary and the Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary it forms the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve. ==Climate== Like most of northern India, Dudhwa has an extreme humid subtropical with dry winters (CWa) type of climate. Summers are hot with temperatures rising up to . During winters from mid-October to mid-March, temperatures hover between . The months of February to April are ideal for visiting the park. Prevalent winds are westerly. The hot wind Loo blows strongly from mid-April up to end of May. Monsoon starting in mid-June and lasting up to September accounts for 90% of the rainfall of . Temperatures range from between a minimum of in winter to a maximum of up to in peak summer. ==Habitat== The area of the park falls within the Upper Gangetic plains and is a vast alluvial plain ranging in altitude from in the farthest southeast to in the extreme north. The park's mosaic of high forest interspersed with grasslands is characteristic of the Terai ecosystems in India and the area is, probably, the last prominent remnant of this type of ecosystem. The forests, especially the sal forests, have always been very dense and can be categorized into northern tropical semi-evergreen forest, northern Indian moist deciduous forest, tropical seasonal swamp forest and northern tropical dry deciduous forest. The main flora comprises sal, asna, shisham, jamun, gular, sehore and bahera. The grasslands comprise about 19% of the park. The wetlands constitute the third major habitat type and include the rivers, streams, lakes and marshes. While many of the major wetlands are perennial with some amount of surface moisture retained round the year, some dry up during hot summer. The park is home to one of the finest forests in India, some of these trees are more than 150 years old and over tall. ==Fauna== Major attractions of Dudhwa National Park are the tigers (population 58 in 2014) and swamp deer (population over 1,600). Billy Arjan Singh successfully hand-reared and reintroduced zoo-born tigers and leopards into the wilds of Dudhwa. Some rare species inhabit the park. Hispid hare, earlier thought to have become extinct, was rediscovered here in 1984. In March, 1984 Indian rhinoceros was reintroduced into Dudhwa from Pobitora Sanctuary in Assam and Nepal. The other animals to be seen here include swamp deer, sambar deer, barking deer, spotted deer, hog deer, sloth bear, ratel, jackal, civets, jungle cat, fishing cat, leopard cat. Dudhwa National Park is a stronghold of the barasingha. Around half of the world's barasinghas are present in Dudhwa National Park. Smaller than the sambar deer, the barasinghas have 12 antlers that collectively measure up to . One can spot herd of these rare animals passing through open grasslands. These animals are smaller than sambar deer and weigh around 180 kg. Due to their slightly woolly, dark brown to pale yellow cloak, the grasslands acts as the perfect camouflage. === Birds === The park has rich bird life, with over 350 species, including the swamp francolin, great slaty woodpecker and Bengal florican. Dudhwa also boasts a range of migratory birds that settle here during winters. It includes among others, painted storks, black and white necked storks, sarus cranes, woodpeckers, barbets, kingfishers, minivets, bee-eaters, bulbuls and varied night birds of prey. There are also drongos, barbets, cormorants, ducks, geese, hornbills, bulbuls, teal, woodpeckers, heron, bee-eaters, minivets, kingfishers, egrets, orioles, painted storks, owls. Dudhwa's birds in particular are a delight for any avid bird watcher where bengal florican is most popular between bird watchers. The marshlands are habitat for about 400 species of resident and migratory birds including the swamp francolin, great slaty woodpecker, Bengal florican, plenty of painted stork, sarus crane, several species of owl, Asian barbet, woodpecker and minivets. Much of the park’s avian fauna is aquatic in nature and found around Dudhwa’s lakes such as Banke Tal. The endangered white-rumped vulture has been sighted in a group of 115 individuals.Singh, K. (2017). 115 endangered vultures sighted on a tree in Dudhwa National Park.

Jeungsanism, as his movement was called, and various Korean new religions (sinheung jonggyo, literally, \\"newly emerged religions\\") derived from it, have been seen by scholars as a syncretism of Buddhism (Bul-gyo), Confucianism (Yu- gyo), Taoism (Do-gyo) with unique religious insights of Kang and certain elements borrowed from Christianity (Gidok-gyo), as well as an underlying Korean shamanism (Musok-Sinang).Flaherty (2011), p. 334. ==Early life== Gang Il-sun was born in Gobu County, Jeolla Province (present-day Deokcheon Township of Jeongeup, North Jeolla Province, Korea) on September 19, 1871, according to the Lunar calendar mostly used by his followers, or November 1, 1871 of the Gregorian calendar.Chong (2016), p. 29. There is a hagiographic literature written by his followers, which describes miraculous phenomena surrounding his early years. For instance, hagiographical accounts record that \\"at the time of his birth (...) two female fairies(仙女) descended from heaven into the delivery room,\\" filling it with a \\"sweet-smelling aroma.\\"Chong (2016), p. 29. Later, it is claimed that he \\"learned Chinese classics at a Seodang and mastered them to the point of memorizing and reciting all of them by heart,\\" through a complete understanding of their meaning.Chong (2016), p. 29. In 1891, Gang married Jeong Chi-sun(鄭治順) (1874-1928), a lady from Gimje County. In 1894, he opened a Seodang in the home of his brother-in-law Jeong Nam-Gi(鄭南基).Jorgensen (2018), p. 360. He acquired a reputation for his knowledge of Buddhism, Confucianism Taoism, and Korean folk religions, and gathered a few disciples.Jorgensen (2018), p. 360. Reputedly, he also visited Kim Il Bu(金一夫) (1826-1898), the well known scholar who introduced the Jeong- yeok(正易), i.e. a new interpretation of the Chinese I Ching (Book of Changes).Chong (2016), p. 30. Kim is said to have offered a new arrangement of the I Ching Chinese trigrams, together with other diagrams and an explanatory text, including insights he had received in a mysterious vision. His re- balancing of the trigrams had a profound influence on many Korean new religions, including those derived from Gang.See Lee (2016), pp. 81-82. ==Donghak== In 1860 Choe Je-u, concerned about the growing influence of the West, the increasing Japanese presence in Joseon Korea, widespread corruption in government and established religion, and abuse of power by the yangban (aristocratic social class), alleged he had a revelation from the Supreme God Sangje (Shang-ti in Chinese) and attained enlightenment. Choe Je-u became the founder of the Donghak (Eastern Learning) movement, the prototype of many subsequent Korean syncretistic new religions. Donghak culminated in the unsuccessful Donghak Rebellion of 1894, which was fueled by a combination of religious fervor centering on the millennial visions of a coming messiah and anger regarding Seoul's high taxes. Central to Choe Je-u’s teachings was a belief in Hu-Cheon Gaebyeok(後天開闢), the Great Opening (Gaebyeok) of the Later World (Hu-Cheon), the new age paradise of Donghak, which also later characterized Gang Il-sun’s millenarian vision.Rhee (2007). Gang Il-sun, in fact, insisted that he was Sangje himself who, prior to incarnating on earth, had bestowed that revelation upon Choe Je-u. Gang \\"had considerable connections with the Donghak movement, not only ideologically but also geographically,\\" as the village where Gang lived was only four kilometers away from the location where the first uprising of the Donghak revolution began. Later, Gang gathered a number of followers in the North Jeolla province, where he lived, and among them where some members of Donghak.Chong (2016), p. 31. Although he was interested in the religious ideas of Donghak, Gang Il-sun predicted, quite correctly, the defeat of Donghak's peasant militia, and advised his followers not to join it. He believed that the problems of Korea, and human society in general, would be solved through spiritual awakening rather than armed rebellion.Chong (2016), p. 34. ==Messianic Claims== After the bloody defeat of Donghak, Gang Il-sun wandered around Korea for three years, surveying public sentiment.Flaherty (2011), pp. 334-335. In 1900, he returned home and, starting in the years that followed, gathered a sizable number of followers. According to these followers, during the Summer of 1901 he achieved enlightenment on the Moaksan mountain, after forty-nine days of ascetic practices and fasting.Flaherty (2011), p. 335. In fact, the followers claimed for their spiritual leader much more than enlightenment, as they accepted his claim that he was Sangje, the Supreme Lord, who had bestowed a revelation upon Choe Je-u and had than incarnated in this world to initiate a New Age. According to Daesoon Jinrihoe, the largest movement recognizing Gang as Sangje,Jorgensen (2018), p. 360 and p. 377. his ascetic practices in the Moaksan mountain were performed to open the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth and to exercise judgement on the divine beings and were, thus, more than ascetic practices.Daesoon Institute of Religion and Culture (2016), p. 202. The followers also claimed that he judged all deities in charge of the Former World, opened the way to the Later World and, through the rituals he performed between 1901 and 1909, achieved a complete “Reordering of the Universe” (Cheonji Gongsa,天地公事).Lee (2016), p. 83. Daesun Jinrihoe believes that there was a residual work of reordering, to be completed by his successors in the religious orthodoxy, Jo Jeongsan(趙鼎山) (1895-1958) and Park Wudang (朴牛堂)(1918-1996). Another branch of Jeungsanism, Jeung San Do, believes that, as Gang was God the Father, his female disciple Goh Pan-Lye(高判禮) (1880-1935), revered by Jeung San Do with the title of Tae-mo-nim, was God the mother and between 1926 and 1935 performed her own reordering of the universe.See \\"Sahng- jeh-nim and Tae-mo-nim\\", official Web site of Jeung San Do. ==Relations with the Japanese== After the Donghak rebellion, Japan had a growing presence in Korea, and this culminated in the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910 and the formal annexation of Korea by Japan. Gang Il-sun maintained an attitude similar to the one he had exhibited when confronted with the Donghak movement. Although critical of those Koreans who sided unconditionally with the Japanese, Gang Il-sun again advised against \\"any form of violence\\" and \\"stressed reconciliation and peace,\\" insisting also that this period of Japanese rule in Korea would bring resolution to the grievances that Japan had in historyChong (2016), pp. 42-44. His peaceful attitude, however, did not protect him from the suspicions of the Japanese authorities. On December 25, 1907, he and a number of his followers were arrested, based on the suspect that they intended to raise an army against the Japanese. Reportedly, \\"even in prison, he made peaceful gestures\\" and \\"did not protest against the authorities in any way.\\"Chong (2016), p. 40. He was finally released on February 4, 1908, continued his rituals and preaching, and passed away on June 24, 1909 at the Donggok Clinic he had established in 1908.Hong (1988), p. 5. ==Legacy== Gang Il-sun chose Goh Pan-Lye as his successor, and after his passing his movement split into many different factions. In 1911, Goh Pan-Lye (Subu, literally “Head Lady,” although there were two \\"Subus\\" in Gang's circle), a female disciple, emerged as the leader of one of the largest factions, which eventually came under the control of Goh's male cousin, Cha Gyeong-Seok (1880-1936). Cha's branch, known as Bocheonism (Bocheob-gyo), according to some scholars \\"had more followers during the Japanese colonial period than any other religion, more than an estimated 6 million adherents.\\"Flaherty (2011), p. 335. However, it declined quite rapidly. Goh had separated from Cha in 1919 and established her own organization, which in turn divided into several rival factions after her death. Kim Hyeong-Ryeol (1862-1932), another leading disciple of Gang Il-sun, originally supported Cha but left him in 1914 and established yet another branch with the help of Gang Il-sun's widow, Jeong. Again, this branch split into several independent groups.Lee (1967), pp. 29-31. Ultimately, around one hundred different groups claiming the legacy of Gang Il-sun came into existence,Hong (1988). For an early map, see Lee (1967). although few of them survive to this day. The largest oneJorgensen (2018), p. 360 and p. 377. is Daesun Jinrihoe, which originates from Jo Jeongsan (1895-1958), who was not a direct disciple of Gang Il-sun but claimed to have received a revelation from him in 1917, eight years after Gang Il-sun's death. Jo Jeongsan's followers claim, however, that in 1909 Gang Il-sun saw a train passing, which had Jo Jeongsan, then a teenager, aboard with his family, heading to Bongcheon, Manchuria, to live in exile there, and stated: “A man can do anything at the age of 15 if he is able to take his identification tag (hopae) with him.” Jo Jeongsan's disciples later claimed that these words amounted to an endorsement by Gang Il-sun of Jo Jeongsan as his successor.Daesoon Institute of Religion and Culture (2016). Gang's only daughter, Sun-Im (1904-1959), originally accepted Jo but later established her own branch, known as Jeung San Beob Jong Gyo, which is headquartered in Korea's North Jeolla province, and after protracted litigation with other branches obtained the mortal remains of Kang, which are currently at its headquarters.Lee (1967), p. 45. Be it as it may be, and although statistics are in turn a matter of contention, there is little doubt that a large number of Koreans, perhaps as much as several millions, are today connected with one or another branch of the religious movement started by Gang Il-sun and recognize him as a divine incarnation, the majority of them belonging to Daesun Jinrihoe.Baker (2016), pp. 1-2 Both Daesun Jinrihoe and Jeung San Do have also started a missionary activity abroad, particularly in the United States. Certainly, Gang Il-Sun did not believe that his message of salvation was restricted to Korea and indeed he explicitly taught that it was intended for the whole world.Chong (2016), pp. 47-49. ==See also== * Daesun Jinrihoe * Jeung San Do * Bocheonism ==Notes== ==References== *Baker, Don (2016). “Daesoon Sasang: A Quintessential Korean Philosophy.” pp. 1–16 in Daesoon Academy of Sciences, Daesoonjinrihoe: A New Religion Emerging from Traditional East Asian Philosophy.

He was a head coach in college basketball for 30 years before becoming an assistant coach in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was an assistant to Phil Jackson on nine NBA championship teams with the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers. Winter was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011. ==Early life== Winter was born near Wellington, Texas (a fact which later provided him with his nickname when his family moved to California) 15 minutes after twin sister Mona Francis. The Winter family moved to Lubbock, Texas in 1929, where his mechanic father died of an infection when Tex was ten years old. Winter had to work while in elementary school to help his family, one such job was to collect boxes for a local baker in exchange for day-old bread. In 1936, Winter and his sister moved to Huntington Park, California with their mother, who would work as a clothing store sales manager. His older football star brother Ernest remained in Texas to finish high school while his older sister Elizabeth had already married and moved to California first and encouraged them to move there. While attending Huntington Park High School, Winter worked with Phil Woolpert and Pete Newell as a ball boy for Loyola University. After graduation from high school in 1940, Winter attended college at Compton Junior College for two years, where he became a renowned pole vaulter and earned a scholarship to Oregon State University. He was on the basketball and track teams at both schools. As a pole vaulter, Winter competed against Bob Richards, a 1948 and 1952 olympian. He was considered a strong candidate for the US Olympic team in 1944, but the Olympics were cancelled by World War II. Winter met his wife Nancy at Oregon State. Both of them entered the United States Navy in early 1943, with Winter going into fighter pilot training and his wife into WAVES. After his pilot's wings were conferred he was assigned to fighter pilot duty in the Pacific. However, his orders were rescinded after his brother's plane was shot down, and Winter remained at Naval Air Station Glenview in Illinois for the duration of the war. After the war, he was assigned to NAS Corpus Christi as a test pilot for an experimental jet craft. While in the navy, Winter was a starting guard for his basketball team under the commanding officer Chuck Taylor. He left the Navy with the rank of Ensign in 1946. Winter returned to college after the war at the University of Southern California, where he learned the triangle offense from his coach Sam Barry. At USC, Winter became an All-American pole vaulter and was a teammate of Bill Sharman, Alex Hannum, and Gene Rock, future professional basketball players. ==College coaching career== After graduating college in 1947, Winter immediately entered the coaching profession as an assistant to Hall-of-Famer Jack Gardner at Kansas State University. He would work as a basketball coach for the next 61 years. In 1952, Winter began a two-year stint as head coach at Marquette University, becoming the youngest coach in major college basketball. In 1954 Winter returned to Kansas State.ABC News (49): Former K-State basketball star dies at 72; February 22, 2007. accessed on October 2, 2007.Canada Basketball: Candidates for the 2007 Class of the FIBA Hall of Fame announced; May 25, 2007 accessed on October 2, 2007. Winter served as Kansas State's head coach for the following 15 years, posting a 261-118 (.689) record. He still owns the record for most league titles (eight) in school history and twice led the Wildcats to the Final Four (1958 and 1964). Winter guided K-State to postseason play seven times overall, including six trips to the NCAA Tournament, and boasts one of the highest winning percentages in K-State's history. Winter was named UPI National Coach of the Year in 1958 after he led Kansas State to the Final Four by knocking off Oscar Robertson and second-ranked Cincinnati in an 83-80 double-overtime thriller. Junior center Bob Boozer was one of three Wildcats to be named a first team All-America, along with teammates Jack Parr and Roy DeWitz. K-State advanced to their fourth Final Four in 1964. Winter's Wildcats knocked off Texas Western and Wichita State to reach Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri. Two-time Big Eight selection Willie Murrell averaged 25.3 points per game during the run, which ended in a 90-82 loss to eventual national champion UCLA. In 1962, Winter also wrote the book, entitled The Triple-Post Offense, on the triangle offense – the offense which he utilized with such success at Kansas State. Following his leaving Kansas State to his assistant Cotton Fitzsimmons, Winter also served as head coach at the University of Washington (where he was hired by then Athletic Director Joseph Kearney), Northwestern University (1973-1978), and Long Beach State. In 1982, LSU's Dale Brown, who Winter befriended when Brown was a high school coach, hired him as an assistant for one year 1983-84. In 30 years as a college head coach, Winter compiled a career record of 453–334. ==Professional coaching== Winter in 2009 Winter was hired by Pete Newell as head coach of the Houston Rockets for two seasons, 1971-1973, posting a 51–78 () record. In 1985, Winter started another chapter of his life after contemplating retirement, serving as an assistant coach with the Chicago Bulls, and teaching the triangle offense to Michael Jordan. He was hired to the position by General Manager Jerry Krause, an old friend he had met while at Kansas State. As an assistant to Phil Jackson, who took over as the Bulls' head coach in 1989, Winter and his ball-movement offense were an integral part of the Bulls' NBA championships in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, and 1998. Winter followed Jackson to the Los Angeles Lakers. Led by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, the Lakers won three championships using the triangle system in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Winter was also a consultant for the NBA champion 2008–09 Los Angeles Lakers team. ==Health and death== On April 25, 2009, Winter suffered a stroke in Manhattan, Kansas, while attending a Kansas State basketball reunion. He lived near Kansas State in Manhattan, Kansas with his Alzheimer's-stricken wife and son Brian. He suffered from the after-effects of his 2009 stroke, counting an uncooperative right side and nerve pain in his neck and shoulder. He has two other sons, Russ and Chris.

Upper Benefield used to have a pub 'The Wheatsheaf' pub and hotel, originally a coaching inn dating from the 17th century. The pub is now closed and being renovated to residential properties. There is also a cricket club. Benefield Parish Church in Lower Benefield is dedicated to St Mary and is part of the Benefice of Benefield, Glapthorn and Oundle St Peter's. It is in the Rural Deanery of Oundle and is part of the Archdeaconry of Oakham within the Diocese of Peterborough. The church was re-built in 1847 and paid for by James Watts Russell of Biggin Hall, about west of Benefield (see below). Only the chancel of the old church was retained, dating from the 14th-century.Victorian County History on-line \\"A History of the County of Northampton: Volume 3\\" edited by William Page 1930 ==Notable residents== * Miles Joseph Berkeley (1803-1889) cryptogamist, clergyman, and founder of the study of plant pathology ==Other buildings== ===Biggin Hall=== The Hall dates from ca.1700 and is partly hidden behind a portico of ca.1750. There are two pavilions at each end. Miles Joseph Berkeley (1 April 1803 – 30 July 1889), an English cryptogamist and clergyman, and one of the founders of the science of plant pathology, was born in the Hall. ===Benefield Castle=== Established in 1208, all that remains is a moated platform west of the church. It has been derelict since 1315 or earlier. It may have been one of the numerous forts thrown up during the anarchy of King Stephen's reign (1138–44). It was in existence in 1208, when John seized it for the debts of Hugh de Lisurs. On 15 May 1264, the day following the Battle of Lewes, Henry III, while a prisoner with Simon de Montfort, issued a mandate to the knights and others in Benefield Castle, stating that peace having been made between the king and his barons, they were not to go out of the castle nor do any ill in those parts. It was probably in the following year that, the castle being held for Edward the king's son, the men of the castle plundered the manor of Biggin and crossed the river to Oundle, where and at Ashton they took a number of cattle. The men of Oundle, however, made a counter-attack and recovered many of their beasts. Not long after this date the castle was probably dismantled. In 1298 it is described as an old castle, (fn. 4) and in 1315 the site of the castle only is referred to. (fn. 5) It continued a ruin and is so described in 1378. ===Rectory Farm=== The building dates from 1877-8 and is tall and gabled. ===Fermyn Woods Hall=== Located about south-west has an Elizabethan centre in the plan of a letter 'E' with neo-Elizabethan extensions of ca.1850. The south side of the stables has the gateway from nearby Lyveden New Bield as its centrepiece. The Hall was occupied by the Belville family in the 1930s. When they left its size was reduced and parts auctioned off including the elaborate large porch. ==References== == External links == *Wildlife around Benefield and Oundle *The Benefice of Benefield, Glapthorn and Oundle St Peter's Category:Villages in Northamptonshire Category:East Northamptonshire District Category:Civil parishes in Northamptonshire ","title":"Benefield"},{"id":"3227883","text":"Camael, also spelled Khamuel, Camiel, Cameel and Camniel, is the Archangel of strength, courage and war in Christian and Jewish mythology and angelology.

The head of railways and airport is Dehradun. The nearest railway station is 210 kilometres while nearest airport is 220 kilometres from the national park. Also Harsil is the nearest town (30 km). ==Geography== The Gangotri National Park (GNP) (Long. 78°45’ to 79°02’ East and Lat 30°50’ to 31°12’ North) is located in the upper catchment of Bhagirathi river in the Uttarkashi District of Uttrakhand State, India. The northeastern park boundary is located along the international boundary with China. It falls under the Biogeographical zone – 2A West Himalaya (Rodgers and Panwar, 1988) and covers an areas of 2,390 km². (Fig.1&2), including a considerable stretch of snow-clad mountains and glaciers. The Gaumukh glacier, the origin of river Ganges is located inside the park. The Gangotri, after which the park has been named, is one of the holy shrines of Hindus. The park area forms a viable continuity between Govind National Park and Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary. High ridges, deep gorges and precipitous cliffs, rocky craggy glaciers and narrow valleys characterize the area. There is a high variation in the elevation gradients from 1,800 to 7,083m, which in turn reflects in the diverse biomes, from subtropical communities to alpine meadows. ==Ecology== The Gangotri National Park is typical of high altitude ecosystems, with decisive influence from Trans Himalayan elements in both physical and biological characteristics. The landscape is dominated by alpine scrub, although forests of kharsu oak and betula are observed in patches in lower and higher elevation areas respectively. The mountain sides along the entire route from Gangotri to Gaumukh are steeper and are distinctly broken up by consequential landslides. These landslides appear to have caused irreversible isolation between forest patches including the alpine vegetation. The impact of these natural events on the forest and the dependent organisms is important to document, so as to assess the long-term value of this park in the wildlife perspective. The ground vegetation, although drying, is suggestive of high ground biomass in this area, and the recorded ground vegetative cover ranges from 10 to 50% (average = 25%). == References == Category:Geography of Uttarkashi district Category:National parks in Uttarakhand ","title":"Gangotri National Park"},{"id":"3227902","text":"Pulborough railway station serves the West Sussex village of Pulborough.

Georges Mouton, comte de Lobau (21 February 1770 – 27 November 1838) was a French soldier and political figure who rose to the rank of Marshal of France. ==Biography== Born in Phalsbourg, Lorraine, he enlisted in the French Revolutionary Army in 1792. Serving in the early campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars, he by 1800 he was promoted to the rank of colonel. He was promoted to général de brigade in 1805, after the establishment of the French Empire, and to général de division in 1807. Mouton distinguished himself in the battles of Jena, Landshut and Aspern-Essling. In 1810, he was created count of Lobau in recognition of his role in the battle of Aspern. During the Russian Campaign, he acted as a senior aide-de-camp to Emperor Napoleon I of France. He then served with distinction during the 1813 campaign, seeing action at the Battles of Lützen and Bautzen. After Dominique Vandamme was made prisoner during the battle of Kulm, Lobau commanded the retreat of the remnants of the corps. He served under Laurent Gouvion Saint- Cyr when, upon the retreat after the battle of Leipzig, the latter was trapped in Dresden and after the surrender of these forces he became a prisoner of the Austrian Empire for the rest of the war. During the Hundred Days, Lobau rallied to Napoleon and was made commander of the VI Infantry Corps which he led in the battles of Ligny and Waterloo. At the Battle of Waterloo he distinguished himself in the defense of Plancenoit against the Prussians. After the Second Restoration, Lobau was forced to go into exile until he was allowed to return to France in 1818. He was elected to the House of Representatives from 1828 to 1830 as a liberal, and, in 1830, he joined the July Revolution as commander of the National Guard. As a reward for his services to King Louis-Philippe he was made a Marshal in 1831, the same year he was made a Peer of France. In 1832 and 1834, Lobau was assigned to suppress insurrections, a task in which he was successful.

The battle was part of the civil war that was taking place in Iceland at the time between various powerful clans during the time known as the Age of the Sturlungs. The Battle of Örlygsstaðir was fought on 21 August 1238 between Sighvatur Sturluson (brother of Snorri Sturluson) and his son Sturla Sighvatsson on the one hand, and Kolbeinn ungi and Gissur Þorvaldsson (later Earl Gissur) on the other. Sighvatur had nearly 500 men but there is no evidence available of the size of Sturla's following. Nonetheless, historians estimate that the Sturlungar had a total of 1000 men. Gissur and Kolbeinn had almost 1700 men in total. The areas controlled by the Sturlungar were more populous but the settlements were more scattered which made it difficult for the Sturlungar to assemble fighting men. The Ásbirningar and Haukdælir clans emerged victorious after a short battle. Over 50 men were killed on that day, including Sighvatur and Sturla. According to the Saga of the Icelanders, Gissur only lost seven men whereas Kolbeinn lost none. Five others, including Þórir Jökull Steinfinnsson, were executed by beheading following the battle. The names of those who perished on that day are recorded in the Íslendinga saga which is included as a part of the Sturlunga saga. In 1988 a memorial was raised on the site of the battle, which describes the battle. == References == ==Other sources== * Jón Jóhannesson, Magnús Finnbogason and Kristján Eldjárn (eds.)

Bardaï came to international attention in 1974, when a rebel group, led by Hissène Habré, attacked the town and captured a French archaeologist, Françoise Claustre, and two other European citizens. The rebels established an anti-French radio station here during the civil war, which was known as the \\"Voice of Liberation of Chad\\", or Radio Bardaï.

Benhall is a village and civil parish in the East Suffolk district of Suffolk, England. Located to the south of Saxmundham, in 2007 its population was estimated to be 560, reducing to 521 at the 2011 Census. Benhall is split into two; one side of the A12 road is Benhall Low Street, whereas the other is Benhall Green. Benhall Green has a small primary school and a playgroup. The 15th century church of St Mary is a grade II* listed building. The actor Guy Rolfe is buried in the churchyard. The manor of Benhall was granted in 1086 to Robert de Malet, and has since had a long and complicated history, having been owned by many of the most powerful people of their time, including the De La Poles, the Howards and King Henry VIII. The great house of the area is Benhall Lodge. A manor house had existed on the Benhall estate since at least 1225, when it was fortified by Ralph de Sunderland. Long known as Benhall Lodge, the house has been rebuilt by various Lords of the Manor - including in 1638 by Sir Edward Duke, Bt., in 1790 by William Beaumaris Rush, and in 1810 by Edward Hollond. The mansion house has suffered serious fires in 1885 and in 1967, and was restored and slightly remodelled after each. The walled kitchen garden of the country house is now a separate business concern, but the house itself and the surrounding gardens and parkland remains private residential property.

Typically, belaying involves a two person team: a climber ascends, while a belayer takes in their rope slack, ready to catch and arrest their fall; when self-belaying, the climber plays both roles. In mountaineering, a climber can employ a self-belay with an ice axe to prevent a slide down a snow-covered slope. To use an ice axe to self-belay, a climber will hold the axe by the head in the climber’s uphill hand. As the climber moves up the slope, the climber will push the shaft of the axe several inches into the snow with every other step. If the axe is set firmly enough, it will aid in preventing a slip from becoming a fall. If a slip occurs, the climber presses down on the head of the axe causing the shaft to sink deeper into the snow, anchoring the climber. If this method is unsuccessful, the climber may fall and slide down the slope having to rely on a technique called a self- arrest. In rock climbing, self-belaying is also called rope soloing. ==External links== *General principles for solo climbing with a fixed belay rope *Traditional training for ice axe self belay and arrest *Self-belayed rappel Category:Climbing techniques Category:Mountaineering techniques ","title":"Self-belay"},{"id":"3227953","text":"Beer Can House Rice Military is a neighborhood in Houston, Texas, United States.

It is an adaptation of the 1927 final volume of the seven-volume series In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust. The plot is about the anonymous narrator of In Search of Lost Time who reflects on his past experiences while lying on his deathbed. The choice to develop the last volume of In Search of Lost Time allows the film to refer to the entire series of books. For example, the film shows an episode of the first novel, Swann's Way (1913), usually referred to as \\"the lady in pink,\\" as a flashback of Time Regained. The film was entered into the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. ==Plot== Much of the film is composed of flashbacks of Marcel's memories of the past. One leads to another in what Proust called involuntary memory triggered by sights, sounds, and smells from the present. The movie starts off with Marcel Proust on his death bed. He is dictating something for his caretaker Céleste to write out for him. He dismisses her and flips through some pictures naming each person in the photos. This reminds him of his childhood. We then cut to Charlie Morel playing the piano at a party. Odette de Crécy directs the guests in the room to observe Marcel who is about ten years old. Marcel tips his hat to Odette's daughter Gilberte and both are called to take a picture. We return to adult Marcel asking Celeste about the smell of roses in the room. This reminds him of a lunch he once had with Gilberte. Gilberte and Marcel are having lunch and discussing books. Marcel asks to borrow The Goncourt Journals. Marcel recalls a relationship he had with his ex-fiance Albertine, in which he was heartbroken that she had been unfaithful with both women and men. Marcel breaks a tea cup and Gilberte has the pieces cleaned and put in her mahogany box. Marcel has a nightmare and as he tries to pull the service bell, something stops him. He wakes up to a ghostly Albertine stroking his face. He wakes up again to realize that he had been dreaming this ghostly encounter. Marcel and Gilberte are walking down the street discussing her husband Robert de Saint-Loup as it starts to storm. A younger Marcel is examining a picture of the younger Gilberte. There is a note on the back of the photograph. Marcel and his nurse (nanny) are playfully arguing about the signature being signed at the bottom. It transforms from Gilberte, to Albertine, to Libertinage. Robert is reading an excerpt from the newspaper to Charlie with whom he has been having an affair. Charlie dismisses himself saying he must attend an algebra class and Robert becomes upset that he's leaving and throws his newspaper and a picture of Charlie onto the floor. Charlie returns home to Madame Verdurin who also believed he had been at algebra class. She is holding up a picture of a woman that she found hidden behind another picture. She slaps him in fear that he is being unfaithful. Robert and Marcel discuss Robert's mistress Rachel until Gilberte arrives. She is dressed in a red evening gown with a decorative headdress that is an exact copy of the costume Rachel wears to perform at the Comedie Francaise. She walks down the staircase and is followed by a vision of Rachel in the same outfit. As she descends the stairs, it switches back and forth between Gilberte's and Rachel's faces. Gilberte suddenly bursts into tears. Marcel and Gilberte make eye contact which prompts him to check the mahogany box that is on the fireplace. He discovers the broken tea cup. He is then surrounded by friends at a dinner table where they are telling stories about art and gossiping about others. He is then riding a train when he stops to see a younger version of himself in the window. Going back to the party where Charlie is playing the piano, Madame Verdurin asks him to play a song. He claims he has enlisted to go to the front because of boredom and to maintain his reputation. He starts to play Beethoven which is considered shocking since France is at war with Germany. Odette de Crécy and Marcel take a carriage to another party. A siren then sounds which prompts the lights and music to turn off. Odette is then asked to leave the party. There are sounds of missiles and explosions in the background. Marcel makes his way back into the building and moves from a room with guests around a dinner table to the kitchen where Le Prince de Foix and some other men are playing a game with food. The flags in the food represent war zones as they are studying the German troop movements. Robert discusses the war with his uncle, the Baron de Charlus as they hear the all-clear siren. Odette visits a former lover who is sick and in bed. He instructs her to open a gift on the table which reveals several hundred francs. She closes the box and walks towards the bed to caress the man. It then cuts to a funeral in which Marcel attends. The widow reveals the anger she feels at finding letters from her husband's mistress. Marcel reassures her that he loved her best. Robert and Marcel then discuss the war. It then cuts to Marcel inside of an elevator in conversation with the bellhop about whether he had an intimate relationship with Robert. We then see Robert and Marcel at a later time where Robert is dressed in his military uniform. He discusses the bravery of commoners and their willingness to die for their country which makes them the best soldiers. Rachel and Charlie are seen having lunch. She speaks of being written a prescription for croissants as it cures her headaches. She asks Charlie about his recent encounter with his former lover Charlus and we flash back to it. Charlie turns down an invitation to spend the night with Charlus to which he replies, “Charlie! Look out. I’ll get even!” Marcel walks down a dark street and has flashbacks of his childhood. He encounters Le Prince de Foix and they discuss Robert who has been wrongly implicated in a spy scandal. Marcel visits a male brothel full of soldiers earning extra money while on leave from the war. He discovers a room where he hears the cries of Charlus who is being brutally whipped by one of the male prostitutes. As he is being tortured the screen turns red with blood. The whipping turns out to be erotic roleplaying requested by Charlus. He is a regular and knows all of the male prostitutes who work there. Marcel is still spying on him through the window. Marcel joins the soldiers in the common room where he sits in a chair. All the men then tell him not to sit in that chair as it is the place where the elder Prince de Foix died. The soldiers all line up as Charlus enters the room. Charlus walks by each of the soldiers, addresses them, and gives them money. Sirens sound throughout the city once more, signaling air raids. People are seen fleeing the city carrying their belongings. Marcel's maid Francoise discovers that Marcel is still alive and expresses her gratitude towards Robert who rescued him from the cellar. Marcel reads a note from Charlus giving the location of Morel, who is hiding from the police. Marcel meets with Charlie. He says that he is wanted for desertion from the army. Marcel persuades Charlie to settle his differences with Charlus who may be able to help him. Charlie explains that he fears the man. We cut back to the funeral of Robert de Saint-Loup where several women mourn his death. We flash back to Robert talking with a teenage Marcel. This reminds him of their first meeting. Marcel points toward the beach and asks his grandmother if that is Robert de Saint-Loup. She pretends not to see who he's pointing at. Back at Robert's funeral, Charlie shows up with military police. Gilberte tries to ask him to leave but he rebuffs her. Robert's mother thanks Marcel for attending. As they leave, Madame Verdurin frantically searches for Odette to try to prevent Charlie's punishment for desertion. After the war, Marcel is dropped at the park after a long stay at a sanatorium for an unspecified illness. He is met by an elderly, unkempt Charlus who is also suffering from an illness. He is accompanied by the former proprieter of the male brothel Jupien. He starts to list his family members that have passed. He bows to the carriage of Mrs. De Saint-Eurverte. Jupien reminds him that he always hated her but Charlus is unconcerned. Charlus reminds Marcel of their first meeting. Flashback to a teenage Marcel being called by his grandmother. Charlus walks up and scolds him for ignoring his grandmother. Charlus gives Marcel advice about how to behave in the future and lightly insults him. The older Marcel starts walking in the park. He trips and the background changes several times to different places in Marcel's past. Marcel is led into the library at the Princesse de Guarmantes' home where he moves from chair to chair until he is back on the same seat he started in. He is served tea and the sound of the spoon hitting the side of cup reminds him of train operators banging on the wheels of the train. He wipes his mouth after finishing his tea which reminds him of his teenage years at an oceanfront cottage. There is a statue on the beach which is carried off by six gentlemen. We see the same statue, only smaller, in the room where adult Marcel is drinking tea. He picks a book off the library shelf which reminds him of his mother reading the same book to him as a child to help him sleep. A ballroom filled with many guests opens and the crowd moves toward a room filled with sweets and treats. Oriane de Guermantes walks towards Marcel, not knowing it is him. She finally recognizes him and they exchange memories of the past. She tells him that things have changed since he's been away. Charlie is now accepted into polite society and is even a favorite of the princess. She warns Marcel that Gilberte is a tramp; not worth his time. She claims (falsely) that Gilberte's infidelity was the reason that Robert enlisted and that Gilberte enjoyed the status her marriage brought her. She claims that Robert deliberetely got himself killed in the war. He is then introduced to Madame de Farcy, an American married to Count de Farcy by Jacques de Rozier (Austin Bloch). Marcel then introduces him to Prince de Guermantes. Marcel then bumps into Marquis de Cambremer who asks about Marcel's symptoms as he is in the later stages of the same illness. The music reminds Marcel of the time when Albertine played the piano when they lived together. Marcel is discussing music and literature with Albertine, but she does not seem to be listening. She mentions letters exchanged between Morel and her androgynous friend Lea, which arouses jealousy in Marcel. She says that Leá and Gilberte had an affair. He asks if she was ever intimate with Leá. Albertine explains that Leá used to send carriages to Albertine's house to pick her up and ask her if she really liked girls, to which Albertine replied yes just to mess with Leá. Marcel is moved to tears as the violin and piano play in the ballroom. The seating arrangements in the room start to shift back and forth as if they are sliding in the room. He is then greeted by a much older Gilberte who now looks a lot like her mother. She reminisces about Robert and tells Marcel that the former Madame Verdurin (now much older) is now the new Princesse de Guermantes. Gilberte explains that the Guermantes' were ruined by the war and the Verdurin fortune set them right. Oriane then asks Marcel if Gilberte was just playing a grieving widow act. She is upset at what she calls Gilberte's nonchalant attitude despite her husband passing away. Marcel becomes increasingly uncomfortable listening to people criticizing Gilberte and her mother. Madame de Farcy says she feels close to Oriane but is disgusted with Odette despite their being related \\"distantly.\\" Marcel says that he finds it ironic how a person's relations are distant or close depending on how much they are accepted in society. Finally, we see Odette wandering through the party looking lost and sad. Marcel realizes that Odette is the mistress of Oriane's husband the duke, which has made her a social outcast. The duke asks her to leave with him but she says she has better plans. Several people speak to Marcel but he says nothing. Gilberte begins talking and this reminds Marcel of a conversation he had with her husband Robert about men who are attracted to other men. The duke appears about to speak to Marcel but walks away. Odette explains to Marcel that the duke is so overprotective and jealous that he seems to be going mad. He locks her away from the world though she loves her freedom. All of her lovers have been jealous she says. This reminds Marcel of his first meeting with Odette when he was a young child. She was the mistress of his uncle who was also very jealous. The grown-up Marcel finds himself in the same position as his younger self from the beginning of the film: in a room full of hats on the floor. The elderly Marcel visits the young Marcel and tells him of his love for Albertine and Gilberte. We then find both young Marcel and old Marcel travelling through different spaces in time throughout his life. Their last destination is the beach. We are read a quote from the sculptor Salvini. “My life has been a series of extraordinary adventures. To revisit them would only make me sadder. I’d rather use my remaining time to review my last work, Divine Nemesis, otherwise known as The Triumph of Death.” As the angel of death revisited to claim his life, he exclaimed, “What a paradox! You gave me enough time to revisit my whole life, which lasted sixty-three years. The same length of time was too short to review an object I made in 3 months.” The Angel replied, “In this work is all of your life and the life of all men. To review it would take an eternity.” We end with the present day Marcel walking towards the younger Marcel on the beach. == Cast == *Catherine Deneuve as Odette De Crecy *Emmanuelle Béart as Gilberte Saint-Loup *Vincent Perez as Charlie Morel *John Malkovich as Le Baron de Charlus *Pascal Greggory as Robert Saint-Loup, voiced by Patrice Chéreau *Marcello Mazzarella as Marcel *Marie-France Pisier as Madame Verdurin *Chiara Mastroianni as Albertine *Arielle Dombasle as Madame de Farcy *Édith Scob as Oriane de Guermantes *Elsa Zylberstein as Rachel *Mathilde Seigner as Céleste *Christian Vadim as Bloch *Dominique Labourier as Madame Cottard *Philippe Morier-Genoud as Monsieur Cottard *Melvil Poupaud as Le Prince de Foix *Alain Robbe-Grillet as Goncourt *Bernard Garnier as Cambremer *Logan Fuga as Josue ==Reception== ===Release and awards=== Le Temps Retrouvé was released in France on 16 May 1999. The film was one of the nominations for the 2000 César Award for Best Costume Design. The budget for this film was about $10.4 million, however its gross income from box office amounted to about $4.5 million. As of right now, the only source online to rent the film is Vudu. ===Critical reception=== The film was featured at the retrospective commemoration which was held at Lincoln Center at the end of 2016 which ran during the week ending December 22.Richard Brody (2017). \\"The Memory Card\\". The New Yorker, Dec. 19, 2016, p. 30. As stated by Richard Brody of The New Yorker at that time: \\"(This film) is also a triumph of classical cinematic values, reviving Proust's era with an obsessive attention to detail: the trim of mustaches and the cut of collars, a cortege of umbrellas straight out of a painting by Renoir, and hypnotically opulent furnishings seemingly borrowed from movies of the era. Many of Ruiz's films ... involve tricks of time and memory; working with Proust, Ruiz seems to mind-meld with him, raising his own artistry to exquisite new heights.\\" Frédéric Bonnaud describes Time Regained as \\"a film of old fashioned illusionism.\\"Frédéric Bonnaud (2000). \\"Proust Regained\\". Film Comment, July/August 2000, p.61. The New York Times article goes on to say that if there had been any reward for the film, it would have been for sheer ambition.Janet Maslin (1999). \\"FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW; From Sickbed to Boyhood and Back, Echoing Proust\\". The New York Times, Sept. 30,1999. Many thought that it was risky to create a film of this work as the book did not exactly tell a story, but brought the readers around in circles. The film received a three and a half star rating out of four from movie critic, Roger Ebert. The film also received a 68% score on Rotten Tomatoes. While most of the critics spoke highly of the film's ability to bring the book to life, there were a lot of reviews complaining that the film had been a bore. == References == == Further reading == * Michael Goddard, The Cinema of Raúl Ruiz: Impossible Cartographies (Wallflower Press, 2013), pp. 141–151. * Joanna Jaritz, Proust Cinématographe - Wie Raoul Ruiz Proust las (Heidelberg University Publishing, 2017).

One comes from Saxon times and is derived from the name of the river to the west of the village - the Beane. The middle syllable 'ing' is common in place names all over south-east England and means 'people', Benington therefore meaning The Town of the Beane Folk. The second view is that Benington is a corruption of the name 'Belinton' which appears in the Domesday Book.

The park was originally established in 1970, conserving a area of forest surrounding the river. In 2002, the park was vastly expanded to cover a total of . ==Pine forest == Pine tree (Pinus sylvestris) in Stabbursdalen Some 7,500–5,000 years ago when the climate was warmer, the pine forest spread far inland along the fjords and valleys. As it grew colder, the forest retreated and has only survived in sheltered valleys like Stabbursdalen, where it forms the world's northernmost pine forest (Porsanger climate). Its protection is therefore one of the major objectives of this national park. The woodland is open with low shrubby pine trees, in the far north trees grow slowly and are liable to frost and wind damage. The dry sterile soil can only support a poor undergrowth of lichen and heather. At Luobbal, the wetlands form a fertile oasis in an otherwise barren landscape. Along the river, willow and sedge, with pine woodland behind, support a rich bird life. Stabbursdalen is the most northernly habitat for many species, including black grouse and osprey, and wetlands are important breeding ground, especially for ducks. Old hollow pine trees provide good nesting places for the goldeneye and goosander. ==People in the park== For the coastal Saami people (sjøsamene), the natural resources of Stabbursdalen formed a significant part of their subsistence. Hunting, fishing, and collecting animal fodder have long traditions, but by careful harvesting few traces remain in the landscape. In Luobbal, sedge was previously cut for winter fodder, while tree stumps in the forest bear witness of timber cut for building boats and houses. There are remains of pit-falls where wild reindeer were hunted in the past, but domestic reindeer herding took over in the 17th century. Today, the area provides summer grazing for the reindeer. ==Name== The valley was first named \\"Tabors dal\\" (after Mount Tabor) by a missionary in the 18th century (to replace the Sami languages name Rávttosvuopmi). This was later misunderstood (by folk etymology) as \\"Stabbursdalen\\". The first element was then assumed to be the genitive of stabbur (but there has never been a building like that in the valley). ==References== ==External links== * Map of Stabbursdalen National Park * Image Category:National parks of Norway Category:Protected areas of Troms og Finnmark Category:Protected areas established in 1970 Category:Tourist attractions in Troms og Finnmark Category:1970 establishments in Norway Category:Porsanger ","title":"Stabbursdalen National Park"},{"id":"3228043","text":"Viking Ship Museum at Bygdøy The Viking Ship Museum (Norwegian: Vikingskipshuset på Bygdøy) is located on the Bygdøy peninsula in Oslo, Norway.

The Gokstad and Oseberg ships had been stored in temporary shelters at the University of Oslo. An architectural contest was held, and Arnstein Arneberg won. The hall for the Oseberg ship was built with funding from the Parliament of Norway, and the ship was moved from the University shelters in 1926. The halls for the ships from Gokstad and Tune were completed in 1932. Building of the last hall was delayed, partly due to the Second World War, and this hall was completed in 1957. It houses most of the other finds, mostly from Oseberg.Vikingskipshuset November 8, 2009 ===Museum extension=== On 20 December 2000 the University of Oslo had supported a proposal by the Historical Museum to move the ships and all the grave goods to a proposed new museum in Bjørvika, Oslo. There has been much debate about this suggestion, both in the museum and archaeological community as well as in the media. Opponents to the move have raised concerns that the ships are too fragile and that they will not survive the move undamaged, while proponents claim otherwise, suggesting a move could go ahead without inflicting serious damage to the finds.The Viking ships will probably stay at Bygdøy In 2015 the Ministry let Statsbygg announce a competition for the expansion of existing facilities at Bygdøy.

The line was initially operated by the London and North Western Railway before being absorbed by the Cambrian Railways, which became part of the Great Western Railway at the grouping which came into effect on 1 January 1923. Midland Counties Dairy bought and operated the creamery at Cilcewydd. A siding from the station gave access for milk trains to the creamery. About 100 metres north of the station were exchange sidings with the narrow gauge Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway which opened for freight traffic in 1903 and closed in 1956 with a separate station serving passenger traffic until 1931.

Two of the four platforms at the old station were later taken out of use. Subsequent development of the A483 road Welshpool bypass (opened in July 1993)Hansard required the railway line to be shifted to the south. To enable this the original station was closed, and a new single island platform constructed by British Rail south of it, to allow realignment in May 1992. The replacement station platform is reached by a pedestrian bridge crossing both the railway and the A483, with long uncovered inclines to the north and stepped access from the south.

Faber & Faber) Innocent Blood (1980) is an English mystery novel by P. D. James. It follows a young woman named Philippa Palfrey in her quest to discover more about her biological parents and the crimes in their past. == Plot summary == A young woman, Philippa Palfrey, haas always known that she was adopted. Her adoptive father, Maurice, is a university lecturer and television personality. He is also a spokesperson for the Young Socialists party and a writer of textbooks on sociology. Philippa's adoptive mother, Hilda, is a magistrate with a local juvenile court and an amateur cook. At the age of 8 years old, Philippa suppresses memories of her biological parents and in the intervening years, creates an idealised version of her parents. When she attains majority, Philippa conducts a rudimentary investigation of her biological parents and discovers the truth: her biological parents were convicted ten years ago for the rape and murder of a young girl, Julie Scase, which caused her to be put up for foster care and eventual adoption by the Palfreys. She discovers her father died in prison a few years after the conviction and her birth mother is still alive, due to be released after 10 years in an English women's prison. She returns home after the discovery and confronts Hilda, who is shocked and dismayed to learn the adoption order was unsealed. It is after a strained dinner party with three guests where Philippa places her adoptive family in a position where the elder Palfreys have a contentious argument with Philippa. When her mother, Mary Ducton, is released from prison, Philippa looks her up, decides to live with her in a small flat in London and try to recreate the mother-daughter relationship. They rent a small flat in Central London and have a menial job at a fish and chip shop to supplement Philippa's meagre savings. Mary Ducton provides Philippa with an account of the murder/rape and a bit of background information on the rapist, Martin. It is revealed later that the account was written recently, presumably for Philippa's benefit. Norman Scase, the father of the murder victim, has sworn vengeance and prepares to track down Mary and kill her as had been the dying wish of Julie's mother and Scase's wife. With the help of a private investigator, Norman Scase discovers the date and time of the murderess's release from her prison in York and follows her and Philippa back to London. He loses them in the London underground and therefore undertakes a surveillance of the Palfrey residence, in the hope that one of her adoptive parents will lead him to Philippa and thus to the woman he intends to kill. The novel reaches its climactic ending when Scase breaks into the flat only to find that Mary Ducton has already committed suicide. He nonetheless stabs her already dead body. Philippa orders him out and she takes the blame for the stabbing. She then rings Maurice, who arrives quickly on the scene, calls the police and at the same time ensures that Philippa is not charged with any crime or misdemeanour. In an epilogue chapter Philippa meets Norman Scase after a service in the chapel of King's College, Cambridge, where she is a student. It emerges that she has published a book under her new name, Philippa Ducton, and also that Norman has found love with Violet, the blind helper at the hotel where he stayed when he was spying on Philippa's adoptive mother. ==Literary significance and criticism== \\"P. D. James chose to write a novel in which crime might figure but would not be the mainspring of the action. The work is a great success -- with the public and with the connoisseurs. ...

From 1871 to 1940 the Van Railway terminated at Caersws. The station was built by the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway of the Cambrian Railways in the 1890s. Originally there was a passing loop, a goods shed, a water tower and a ticket office and a signal box - the latter remained in use until March 2011 as a gate box to supervise the station level crossing (this is now operated from Machynlleth). The station was threatened with closure in 1964 along with all of the other wayside stops on the former Cambrian main line (as a consequence of the Beeching Axe), but reprieved by the then Minister of Transport Tom Fraser in December that year to act as the notional railhead for the town of Llanidloes (following the demise of the Mid-Wales Railway that served it directly).Disused Stations - Montgomery Disused Stations Site Record; Retrieved 31 July 2017 In February 2013, Caersws station won the \\"Wales’ Best Unstaffed Train Station\\" award, supported by Keep Wales Tidy.http://www.keepwalestidy.org/10408 ==Facilities== Though unstaffed, the station has a ticket machine installed.

Kit made her first on-screen appearance on 25 April 2003 and made her final appearance as a regular character in February 2004 but continued to reappear in a recurring capacity, making her final appearance on 3 July 2007. Kit's storylines have included battling alcoholism, falling for Noah Lawson, being stranded in the bush with Kim Hyde and subsequently falling pregnant with his baby. ==Casting== Isabel Lucas auditioned for the role of Kit, however, it was actress Amy Mizzi who was eventually cast. ==Storylines== Kit is the eldest daughter of Beth (Clarissa House) and Jack Hunter (Ian Lind) and the sister to Scott (Kip Gamblin), Robbie (Jason Smith, Henry (Tobi Atkins) and Matilda (Indiana Evans). Kit is first seen when she turns up drunk at the Sarah McKay drop-in centre. She steals Noah Lawson’s (Beau Brady) motorcycle and nearly causes an accident when she rides towards a car carrying her mother, Beth and Rhys Sutherland (Michael Beckley). Beth and Kit’s older brother, Scott take a hard line approach to her alcoholism and with Noah’s help place her into a Tough Love rehabilitation programme which requires Kit to leave Summer Bay for a while. When Kit returns, she begins to suffer a few wobbles. Local doctor Flynn Saunders (Joel McIlroy) tells her if she keeps drinking at the rate she does, she may be dead by the age of 21. Noah helps her again and Kit develops romantic feelings towards him but he does feel the same way about her. Kit returns to school to complete Year 12 and Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) becomes her mentor and takes her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings to confront her problems.

She makes several returns during the year for her other brother Robbie’s 17th birthday and offers her stepsister Jade Sutherland (Kate Garven) the chance to come with her when she returns to the city. When Kit hears of Scott’s alleged death at sea, Kit races back to the bay. Scott resurfaces alive and unscathed and she leaves again. Kit grows closer to Kim Hyde (Chris Hemsworth) after several arguments and they begin a relationship, which upsets Matilda, who had since had a crush on Kim and assumed that she was the Hunter sister he was in love with. Kit leaves again and on her next visit she sees how badly Scott is taking his break up with Dani Sutherland (Tammin Sursok). She ends up going with Scott to Paris on a trip he'd originally organised with Dani, however she gets a job as a tour guide and stays there while Scott returns, upsetting Kim. When Kit does return to the bay to resume her relationship with Kim she is heartbroken to learn he is now seeing Hayley and is expecting a child with her. During this visit she finds herself at war with Amanda Vale (Holly Brisley) who is dating Scott and tries to alert him to the fact she is cheating on him but after a tussle with Amanda the evidence is lost. Amanda later spikes Kit’s drink which causes her to become drunk, leading Beth to think she is falling off the wagon, resulting in Kit being sent to rehab once more. After the death of her grandfather Graham Walters (Doug Scroope) and more battles with Amanda, Kit, Robbie, Kim and several others are injured in an explosion at Jack Holden (Paul O'Brien) and Martha MacKenzie’s (Jodi Gordon) wedding. While being airlifted to a city hospital for treatment, the helicopter crashes leaving the party stranded. Kit sprains her ankle while searching for help in the bush and Kim stays with her while the others go to get help. Believing they may die before being rescued, Kit and Kim have sex. They are rescued and Kim’s wife Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews) finds out about their fling but decides to forgive Kim. After Kit recovers, she goes back to the city. Kit returns at Christmas visibly pregnant and tells Kim she is carrying his baby. Rachel agrees to support them but struggles. Animosity builds between Kit and Rachel to the point where during a major argument, Kit suffers a migraine and is driven to the hospital by Rachel. On the way they crash through some roadworks and end up perched on a cliff. Kim rescues them both but blames Rachel until Kit tells him not to blame Rachel. James Dalton (Gylton Grantley), Kit’s ex-boyfriend from University arrives in the Bay and tells her he wants to be there for her and the baby and Kit gives him another chance.

Kit later admits to Matilda that she still loves him. Kit and Kim later kiss once more but Kim pulls away telling her he still loves Rachel. Kit hears of Kim and Rachel trying for their own child and decides to return to the city with Archie. Kim and Rachel’s marriage becomes increasingly volatile and Kim later admits to Kit his feelings for her, but tells her he is unsure of them. Kit forces Kim to choose between her and Rachel. Kim’s failure to decide drives Kit to leave with Archie and she struggles, living in a run-down bedsit with an unreasonable landlord and a nuisance neighbour.

It is located in Lawngtlai district, in the southeastern region of Mizoram near the Myanmar border. ==Geography== Phawngpui is the highest peak of the Lushai Hills. There is a semi-circular series of cliffs on the western side called Thlazuang Khàm, which have a sharp and deep fall, and serve as the natural home of mountain goats. These cliffs are believed to be haunted by spirits. On the peak, there is a level ground of about 2 km2 in area. ==Etymology and origin== A highly revered peak, considered to be the abode of local deities, Phawngpui was a major centre of folk religion and location for folklore stories. The name is derived from the Lai language, phong meaning \\"grassland\\" or \\"meadow\\", and the suffix -pui meaning, \\"great\\". This was because the mountain was mostly covered with all types of meadows, hence appropriately the \\"great meadow\\". The mountain was, according to the belief of the natives, the abode of several spiritual races. The most important folktale, perhaps, is that of a deity king named \\"Sangau\\"; the actual town at the base of the mountain has become Sangau. Sangau had a son who married the princess of another royal family called Cherian. At the wedding was an exchange of gifts, a couple of hoolock gibbons from Sangau and a pine tree from Cherian. The base area, the main entrance of the mountain bears that name Farpak (meaning \\"pine only\\"). ==Conservation== Since 1992 the mountain has been included in the protected area of the Phawngpui National Park, one of only two national parks of India in Mizoram. The Government of Mizoram allows ecofriendly visit to the mountain only during November to April. ==Flora and fauna== The area is encircled by matted bamboo groves and other alluring vegetations. There are varieties of butterflies, including some rare species found in this region. The Farpak area in Phawngpui is a huge grassland adjacent to a cliff area where one can sight birds like peregrine falcon, Blyth's tragopan, sunbirds, grey sibia, golden-throated barbet, Mrs. Hume's pheasant, hornbill, dark-rumped swift, mountain bamboo partridge, black eagle and other birds. The very rare clouded leopard has been recorded in the Farpak area since 1997. There have been instances of wild orchids being stolen from Phawngpui, efforts are being taken to protect and conserve it. ==See also== *List of mountains in India *Phawngpui National Park ==Gallery== File:2007-blue-mountain-np.jpgPark at sunrise File:2007-blue-mtn- farpak.jpgFarpak grassland ==References== ==External links== # Mizoram Tourism ''' Category:Lushai Hills Category:Hills of Mizoram Category:Tourist attractions in Mizoram Category:Highest points of Indian states and union territories Category:Mountains of Mizoram ","title":"Phawngpui"},{"id":"3228115","text":"Eugen Suchoň memorial in Piešťany Eugen Suchoň (September 25, 1908 – August 5, 1993) was one of the most important Slovak composers of the 20th century. ==Early life== Eugen Suchoň was born on September 25, 1908 in Pezinok, (Slovakia). His father, Ladislav Suchoň, was an organist and teacher. His mother, Serafína Suchoňová, was a piano teacher, and it was from her that he received his first piano tuition. The house was always filled with music and, as a small child, he would listen from under the piano when his father rehearsed at home with other musicians. In 1920, at the age of twelve, he started taking piano lessons at the Bratislava School of Music with the distinguished musician Frico Kafenda. Later, from 1927 to 1931, he continued his studies with the same teacher at the newly established Academy of Music in Bratislava. His early works include several piano compositions and a choral work Veľky Pôst (The Great Fast). He graduated from his composition classes with the Sonata in A-flat for Violin and Piano and a String Quartet (op. 2, 1931, revised 1939). His two-year studies at the Prague Conservatoire under Vítězslav Novák set the seal on the thorough training he had received from Kafenda. Compositions from this period include a Piano Quartet (1933), and the song cycle Nox et solitudo for mezzo-soprano and small orchestra or piano (1932) based on a poem by Ivan Krasko, Little Suite with Passacaglia for piano (1930, orchestrated in 1967), Serenade for Brass Quintet and the Burlesque for Violin and Orchestra. All these works show an already distinguished and mature composer. During this time Eugen Suchoň taught music theory at the Academy of Music and Drama in Bratislava (1933). His works from this period are in a late Romantic idiom with elements of folk modality combined with chromaticism. In particular the popular male choral cycle O horách (\\"Of mountains\\") was a seminal work which established a Slovak national style. This was followed by his monumental cantata, The Psalm of the Sub-Carpathian Land (1938). Many folksong arrangements date from this period, which culminated in his opera Krútňava (The Whirlpool, 1949).AllMusic ==Middle years== The success of Krútňava established modern Slovak opera, and drew international attention. From 1948 to 1960 Suchoň was professor and head of the Department of Music Education at the Teacher Training College in Bratislava. Works from this period include the Fantasies for Violin and Orchestra, Metamorphoses for piano, and the Symphonic Suite for grand orchestra. Suchoň became heavily involved in the practical and theoretical aspects of music education. Of particular significance was his second opera Kraľ Svätopluk (\\"King Svätopluk\\"), completed in 1959. This historic opera represents the monumental dramatic fresco from the period of the Great Moravian Empire. It is a large- scale work with noble aspirations, displaying Slavic motifs and culminating in the victory of good over evil. The work was premiered in Bratislava in 1960, and performed the same year in Prague and Košice. ==Later years== From 1959 to 1974 he was professor of music theory at Bratislava University. His style changed as he incorporated serialism into his compositions. Harmonies emphasizing 2nds, 4ths and 7ths led to polymodality. His later output consists predominantly of chamber and orchestral works, e. g., the song cycle Ad astra (1961), based on poems by Štefan Žáry, the mixed choir cycle O človeku (\\"about a human\\"), the Poème macabre for violin and piano, Contemplations for narrator and piano, Six Compositions for Strings, the Rhapsodic Suite for piano and orchestra and the Symfonická fantasia na BACH (1971). His piano cycle Kaleidoscope also exists in a version for piano, string orchestra and percussion. His last works include a Concertino for Clarinet and Orchestra, Elegy, Toccata, and the song cycles Glimpse into the Unknown and Three Songs for Bass.Great Composers: Eugen Suchoň-Classical Nerd on YouTube Suchoň died in Bratislava in 1993. ==Works== ===Dramatic works=== *Music to Stodola's drama King Svätopluk (1935–36) *Music to Gerzo's play Barbara of Celje (1937) ===Operas=== *Krútňava (The Whirlpool; 1941–49), libretto by Suchoň and Štefan Hoza *Svätopluk (1952–59), libretto by Suchoň, Jela Krčméry-Vrteľová and Ivan Stodola ===Symphonic works=== *The little Suite with Passacaglia (1967) *Overture to Stodola's drama King Svatopluk (1934) *Balladic Suite, op. 9 (1934–36, published 1940)Hofmeisters Monatsberichte, 1940, p.43. *Psalm of the Carpathian land (1937–38) *The fight will be finished tomorrow (1950) *Metamorphoses (1951–53) *Symfonietta Rustica (1954–55) *The Breakthrough (1977) *Three Songs for Bass (1984–85) *The Night of the Witches (1927) ===Orchestral works with soloist=== *Burlesque (1933) *Fantasia (1948) *Rhapsodic Suite (1964) *Symphonic Fantasia on B-A-C-H (1971) *Concertino (1977) ===Chamber works=== *Sonata in A Major (1929–30) *String Quartet (1930–31, reworked 1939) *Little Suite with Passacaglia (1931–32) *Serenade (1932–33) *Piano Quartet (1932–33) *Balladic Suite (1935) *Academic Fanfare of Comenius University (1937) *Sonatina (1937) *Wedding Dance from opera The Whirlpool (1971) *Metamorphoses (1951–53) *Poeme Macabre (1963) *Six Pieces for Strings (1955–64) *Kaleidoscope (1967) *Toccata (1973) ===Vocal works=== *Nox et Solitudo (1932) *Ad astra (1961) *Contemplations (1964) *Glimpse into the unknown (1977) ===Choral works=== *How Beautiful You Are (1932–33) *Psalm of the Carpathian Lands, op. 12 (published in 1940) *From the Mountain (1934–42) ===Works for children=== *Pictures from Slovakia (1954–55) ==References== ==Sources== *Suchon compositions *The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.

They are native to warm regions of the southern United States, Mexico, Caribbean and northern South America. This genus is typically found in grasslands and in areas of disturbed ground. ==Description== They are herbaceous annuals, growing to 15–60 cm tall, with bluish green, slightly succulent leaves and large funnel-shaped flowers growing on long straight stems: sometimes erect single stems, other times growing on branching stems that can rise to be eighteen feet tall. The flowers can grow up to two inches across and can be found in a variety of colors. They have been found in all shades of pink, purple, white, and blue. In addition, some are bicolored and some are occasionally found in yellow or carmine-red. Eustoma flowers are either single-flowered or double-flowered. Both types of flowers can be found in all ranges of the possible colors listed above.\\"Lisianthus.\\" Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Cornell University. Web. 4 Aug. 2020 They are usually one to three feet tall, although there are dwarf varieties that only grow up to eight inches in height.\\"Eustoma Grandiflorum\\" Missouri Botanical Garden. Missouri Botanical Garden, n.d. Web. 11 Dec. 2012 ==Taxonomy== Eustoma is a small genus, containing only two or three species. The genus name Eustoma is a compound of the Greek prefix ευ- ( eu- ) 'good / pleasing' and Greek στόμα ( stoma ), 'mouth' - hence '( having a ) pleasing mouth', while the obsolete Lisianthus is a compound of λισσος ( lissos ) 'smooth', and ανθος ( anthos ) 'flower'. ==Cultivation== Eustoma are a beautiful, high-end cut flower, but they are tricky to grow and require some maintenance.\\"Lisianthus\\" Better Homes and Gardens. Better Homes and Gardens, n.d. Web. 11 Dec. 2012 They have tiny seeds that must be sown on the surface, not buried, and they must be planted in rich, well-drained soil and exposed to full sun. They must be kept moist but not overwatered: overwatering may result in the growth and development of fungal diseases. Careful control of temperature is necessary to prevent rosetting and cultivation under cover is recommended to prevent spotting on the petals. Lisianthus flowers will begin to bloom in early summer and some will continue to bloom throughout the later months of the summer. When cut, Lisianthus flowers can last anywhere from two to three weeks in a vase. Eustoma russellianum is particularly popular and has a number of cultivars that are grown for the cut-flower market. ==References== ==External links== * Gentian Research Network: Eustoma * The convoluted history of Lisianthus, Lisianthius, and Lisyanthus Category:Flora of North America Category:Gentianaceae Category:Gentianaceae genera ","title":"Eustoma"},{"id":"3228125","text":"Machynlleth railway station is a railway station on the Cambrian Line in mid- Wales, serving the town of Machynlleth. It was built by the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway (N&MR;), and subsequently passed into the ownership of the Cambrian Railways, the Great Western Railway, British Railways (Western Region) and British Railways (London Midland Region). It is notable that there is a distance of between this station and Caersws, the longest distance between two intermediate stations in Wales. ==History== Machynlleth Station circa 1885, then on the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway Eastbound local train in 1951 The first railway station in Machynlleth was the narrow gauge Corris Railway, which opened its station building on the north side of the main-line goods yard in 1859. This was later made accessible from the mainline station by a flight of steps from the standard gauge platform. The lower yard of the station contained a number of sidings that served transshipment wharves connected to the Corris Railway. A number of the quarries around Corris and Aberllefenni leased wharves here, notably Abercwmeiddaw from 1877 onwards. The existing mainline station dates from 1863 with the opening of the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway. The following year the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway opened the line as far as via , and in 1867 the line was extended from Barmouth to via (then Portmadoc). In 1868 the station and lines were absorbed into the Cambrian Railways.Christiansen, Rex & Miller, R.W. The Cambrian Railways, Vol. 1 David & Charles (1967); p 65 The Cambrian Railways were absorbed by the Great Western Railway on 1 January 1922 as a result of the Railways Act 1921, and became part of British Railways in 1948. New footbridge (July 2018) In 2016 a new footbridge with a lift at both ends to improve disabled access between the platforms was completed. The previous bridge was donated to the Cambrian Heritage Railways. ==Motive power depot== locomotive shed at Machynlleth station The railway built a small engine shed at the station in 1863. This was later expanded by Cambrian Railways, but the extensions were demolished after 1966, when the depot ceased to be used for servicing steam locomotives. Only the original building now survives.Roger Griffiths and Paul Smith, Directory of British Engine Sheds, I., Oxford Publishing (1999), p.188. ==Current operations== Machynlleth is the location where the majority of eastbound or 'up' trains from and combine to go forward as one towards and . Similarly, most trains in the opposite direction divide here before continuing west. The service in each direction is approximately two hourly, although trains to Pwllheli are far less frequent on Sundays. The infrastructure along the line was upgraded during 2010/11, with the intention of allowing hourly trains to and from Aberystwyth. In the 2015-16 timetable, some additional Shrewsbury - Aberystwyth services operate to give an hourly interval frequency during the morning & evening peak periods.GB eNRT, 2017 Edition, Table 76 (Network Rail) Cambrian Line signalling has been centrally controlled from Machynlleth since the 1980s conversion of the route from traditional signalling to a radio-controlled 'RETB' system. On 26 March 2011, the new European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) signalling system went into operational use across the Cambrian Line controlled from Machynlleth. Two days of driver familiarisation followed, with passenger operation commencing on the morning of 28 March 2011. A new control centre has been built on the down side opposite the earlier signal box which has since been demolished. A past train operator, Arriva Trains Wales, has also developed Machynlleth into the main depot for its fleet of Class 158 trains which provide all passenger services on the Cambrian Lines. Replacing the previous Victorian-era depot and yard, Arriva's depot opened in 2007 and prominently features environmentally friendly technologies such as rainwater harvesting and a wind turbine. In 2011, The Bluebell Railway discovered a well-worn totem sign from Machynlleth during the excavating of Imberhorne Cutting as part of the northern extension to East Grinstead, which was used as a landfill site by the local council in the late 1960s. The extension was opened on 23 March 2013. The sign is now displayed in their new museum. ==Facilities== The station has a staffed ticket office in the main building on platform 2. This is open throughout the daytime, however when closed tickets must be bought on the train as no ticket machine is provided. There are toilets, a waiting room and a cafe in the main building and waiting room and shelter on platform 1.

It was established as a wild life sanctuary in 1985, vide notification No. FRS 133/85/5 dated 20 September 1985. But in 1992, the park was renamed as Rajiv Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary but this action had to be reversed due to public pressure against the renaming. Finally, the sanctuary was declared as National Park in 1999 vide notification No. FRW/28/90/154 dated 13 April 1999. ==Geography== The Orang National Park, encompassing an area of , lies on the north bank of the Brahmaputra river, delimited between and within the districts of Darrang and Sonitpur. Pachnoi river, Belsiri river and Dhanshiri River border the park and join the Brahmaputra river. During the monsoon season, the park becomes a veritable flood plain with the many streams overlapping each other. These flood plains constitute twelve wetlands in the park, apart from the 26 man made water bodies. The park is thus formed of alluvial flood plains of the many rivers and is an integral part of the Indo- Burma biodiversity hotspot. The total area of the park has been categorized into: Eastern Himalayan Moist Deciduous Forest-; Eastern Seasonal Swamp Forest - , Eastern Wet Alluvial Grassland- , Savannah Grassland- , Degraded Grassland- , Water body- , Moist Sandy area- and Dry Sandy area -. It has a fairly flat terrain tending north to south with a gentle slope. The elevation in the park varies from to . It is bounded on its south and east by islands and spill channels of the river. But the flat alluvial land is seen distinctly as two terraces; the lower terrace is of recent origin on the bank of the Brahmaputra river and the other is the upper terrace to the north, separated by a high bank running through the park. The whole park is encircled by inhabited villages thus subjecting it to biotic pressure. It has fox holes built by the villagers on its west. ==Climate== The climate in the park comprises three seasons namely, summer, monsoon, and winter. The park is subject to subtropical monsoon climate with rainfall precipitation occurring mostly during the period from May to September. The average annual rainfall is . Temperature records indicate that: During winter months of October to March it varies from in the mornings to in the afternoons, in April it varies from in the morning Celsius to in the afternoon; and in summer months of May and June, the variation is in the morning to in the afternoon. Humidity in the park varies from 66% to 95%. ==Fauna== A sketch of elephant, rhinoceros and pygmy hog (Porcula salvania) (an endangered species of small wild pig) Orang park contains significant breeding populations of several mammalian species. Apart from the great Indian one-horned rhinoceros (68 at the last count), which is the dominant species of the national park, the other key species sharing the habitat are the royal Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris), Asiatic elephant, pygmy hog, hog deer and wild boar. Some important species of the critically endangered and endangered category are the following. The pygmy hog, a small wild pig, is critically endangered, C2a(ii) ver 3.1 as per IUCN listing, and is limited to about 75 animals in captivity, confined to a very few locations in and around north-western Assam, including the Orang National Park where it has been introduced. Other mammals reported are the blind Gangetic dolphin, Indian pangolin, hog deer (Axis porcinus), rhesus macaque, Bengal porcupine, Indian fox, small Indian civet, otter, leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) and jungle cat (Felis chaus). The Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) population was estimated to comprise 19 individuals in 2000, based on pug marks. The great Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) population is estimated at 68 individuals, as per census carried out by the forest department in 2006. ===Fishes=== More than 50 species of fish have been recorded in the river and channels flowing through the park. ===Avian fauna=== Bengal florican, a threatened species conserved in the park The park is home to a variety of migratory birds, water birds, predators, scavengers and game birds. 47 families of Anatidae, Accipitridae, Addenda and Ardeiae are found in the park with maximum number of species. 222 species of birds have so far been recorded, some of which are: spot-billed pelican (Pelicanus philippensis), great white pelican, black-necked stork (Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus), greater adjutant stork (Leptoptilos dubius), lesser adjutant stork (Leptoptilos javanicus), ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea), gadwall (Anas strepera), brahminy duck, mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), pintail (Anas acuta), hornbills, Pallas's fish eagle (Haliaeetus leucoryphus), king fisher and woodpecker, in addition to forest and grassland birds. But Bengal florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis), which is in the threatened list of IUCN is one of the flagship species in the park with a population 30-40 (recorded second highest concentration as per Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS)) and is in the threatened list of IUCN. Migratory birds as far as from America such as the milky American white pelicans have also been reported in the park. ===Reptiles=== Among reptiles, seven species of turtle and tortoise are found, out of which turtle varieties such as Lissemys punctata, Kachuga tecta are common. Among snakes, pythons and cobras are recorded here. Indian rock python, black krait, king cobra, cobra, monitor lizard are the reptiles found here. ==Flora== The park has rich vegetation of forests, natural forest, non- aquatic grass/plants. The forest species found are Bombax ceiba, Dalbergia sissoo, Sterculia villosa, Trewia nudiflora, Zizyphus jujuba and Litsaea polyantha. Among the non aquatic grassland species the prominent are Phragmites karka, Arundo donax, Imperata cylindrica and Saccharum spp. The aquatic grass/plants species found are: Andropogon spp., Ipomoea reptans, Enhydra fluctuans, Nymphaea spp. and Water hyacinth (Eichornia spp). ==Threats and conservation== Hunting, an ancient sport - a painting of rhinoceros hunting in Babarnama From 1991, there was a serious threat to the survival of the park and its wild animals due to intense anthropogenic pressure (illegal occupation by immigrants from neighboring country) and by insurgency. The threats were identified as due to poaching, inadequate manpower for patrolling and security, wide river channels, inadequate infrastructure facilities and hardly any community awareness and participation in conservation. Poaching for wild animals became very serious, particularly of the great Indian rhinoceros whose population reduced to 48 vis-à-vis 97 rhinoceros in 1991. By undertaking anti poaching measures, its number had increased to 68 in 2006-07 but poaching and killing of rhinos are still reported. To check this continued poaching, a \\"Coordination Committee\\" with top officials of Darrang, Sonitpur and the Marigaon districts, including officials of the Forest Department of Assam has been set up. Under an initiative by the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA), the Orang National Park was identified for conservation to evolve policies and programmes to protect the Indian rhinos and to assist in the development of the park. WWF India, the Government of Assam and the International Rhino Foundation (IRF), with support from Zoo Basel, (Switzerland) and the IRV 2020, have undertaken this operation. WWF and Government of India, under the project titled \\"Rhino Vision India (RVI)\\", have also plans to enhance the number of rhinoceros in the park to 300 by 2020, in addition to increasing the number of tigers. Since royal Bengal tigers are also under serious threat in the park, a conservation programme sponsored by WAZA (World Association of Zoos and Aquariums) institutions and Busch Gardens has been launched. It is a closely managed tiger program called the Species Survival Plan (SSP), with the objective to improve the genetic diversity of managed animal populations. Under this programme, the project titled \\"Ecological Monitoring of Wild Tigers in Orang National Park, Assam, India\\" has been launched, in association with AARANYAK, a non-governmental organization in India. With this funding, camera traps and geo-spatial technology are used by local researchers to monitor tiger density in the park. Community participation to help manage, mitigate and prevent conflict between humans and tigers is also envisaged. ==Visitor information== The park is well connected by road, rail and air links with nearby towns in Assam. The nearest town is Tezpur at a distance of from the park. Guwahati is about from the park. It is off the National Highway 52 near Orang town (Dhansirimukh), which is the nearest village that is a further away. Dhansirimukh is away from Guwahati. The nearest railhead is Salonibari () & Rangapara. Both Tezpur and Guwahati are connected very well by the rail network of India. The nearest airport is at Salonibari, from Tezpur (80 km from the park) in Sonitpur district around from Guwahati. October to April is the best season to visit the park. Visiting is restricted to 7:30-9:30 am and 2:00-3:00 pm, the park gate remains closed in between. However, advance authorization of the Divisional Forest Officer, Mangaldoi is essential to visit the park. ==Gallery== File:Kazi rhino edit.jpgKaziranga rhinoceros also found in Orang National park File:Sa-indianrhino.JPGRhino head ==References== Category:Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests Category:National parks in Assam Category:Sonitpur district Category:Darrang district Category:Tourism in North East India ","title":"Orang National Park"},{"id":"3228154","text":"Ernest Lloyd \\"Sonny\\" Hutchins (May 17, 1929 – November 21, 2005) was a stock car driver who raced in NASCAR's Grand National/Winston Cup Series from 1955 to 1974.

Palgrave's Dictionary of Political Economy, Macmillan & Co. Ltd., London, 1926, p.548. Poundage was implemented in order to keep a strong naval force that would protect the Kingdom of England. The custom duty would allow the Monarch of the Kingdom to collect money that would then be spent to develop and maintain the naval force that protects the Kingdom. Poundage was closely associated with tonnage, or tunnage, which was a duty on every tun of wine imported. == Poundage in English History == The levy was introduced in 1347 under Edward II of England and was then granted by the Parliament in 1373. It continued for many years at the same rate until after the Restoration (in 1660, when the English, Scottish and Irish monarchies were all restored under King Charles II) from when the Parliament set the rates according to current needs. Moreover, the Parliament voted in 1414, under Henri V of England, the right for life for every successive monarch to benefit of a royal collection on the ton and pound on imports. King Charles I (reign 1625-1649), portrayed from the studio of Anthony van Dyck, 1636 === Poundage under Charles I of England === Under the reign of Charles I of England (1600-1649), the House of Commons voted a limitation of the royal collection to a period of one year (while the period was for life for the previous monarchs). Charles continued to collect the customs duties, even if no Parliament act was established. In January 1629, Charles opened the second session of the English Parliament, which had been prorogued in June 1628, with a moderate speech on the tonnage and poundage issue. Members of the House of Commons began to voice opposition to Charles's policies in light of the case of John Rolle, a Member of Parliament whose goods had been confiscated for failing to pay tonnage and poundage. On March 2, 1629, Charles I ordered a parliamentary adjournment, but when the parliament's speaker, Sir John Finch, was held by members of the Parliament in his chair in order to delay the end of the session, Charles decided to dissolve the Parliament. Sir John Finch as well as nine members of the Parliament were imprisoned. ==== The Tonnage and Poundage Act (1641) ==== In September 1640, following the Bishops' Wars, King Charles I issued writs summoning the Parliament to convene on 3 November 1640. It was the creation of the Long Parliament, that lasted until it voted its own dissolution on the 16 March 1660. In 1641, the Tonnage and Poundage Act was voted by the Long Parliament, that would regulate all the taxes in force within the kingdom, concerning consequently the current poundage imposed on imports and exports. Garter robes by John Michael Wright === Poundage under Charles II of England === Under the reign of Charles II of England (1660-1685), the Convention Parliament (25 April 1660 – 29 December 1660) was founded and followed the Long Parliament that was dissolved on 16 March 1660. The Convention Parliament, that only has been existing for eight months, established back the right for life to collect the poundage to the monarch of England. From 1660, the successive monarchs of the Kingdom of England are able to collect once again the poundage. === Abolition of poundage === The Customs and Excise Act 1787 replaced all the customs duties, which was including poundage, by a system where individual tariffs would be applied to importations. The act is divided in two mains parts. A first part that includes a statement related to the regulation of all the customs duties. A second part that is listing tables of duty and drawback amounts for all types of products. A list comprising all importations and tariffs related to each import was consequently put in place. == Poundage on postal orders == 248x248px In Britain, and elsewhere, the term poundage is used for the charge imposed on the sale of a postal order.Annual Register 1914, p.262. A postal order is a financial instrument usually intended for sending money through the mail. It is purchased at a post office and is payable at another post office to the named recipient. The poundage represents the small fee for the service that is paid by the purchaser. == See also == *History of the English fiscal system *Tonnage and Poundage *Charles I of England *Charles II of England *Long Parliament *Convention Parliament == References == Category:History of taxation in the United Kingdom Category:Numismatics Category:Postal orders Category:Economy of medieval England Category:Protectionism Category:Taxation in England Category:Customs duties Category:Trade in the United Kingdom Category:1347 establishments in England Category:1347 ","title":"Poundage"},{"id":"3228198","text":"St Margaret Lothbury is a Church of England parish church on Lothbury in the City of London; it spans the boundary between Coleman Street Ward and Broad Street Ward. Recorded since the 12th century, the church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 and rebuilt by the office of Sir Christopher Wren. St Margaret Lothbury still serves as a parish church, as well as being the official church of five Livery Companies, two Ward Clubs and two Professional Institutes. It also has connections with many local finance houses, all of which hold special services each year. ==History== The earliest mention of St Margaret Lothbury is from 1185.\\"London:the City Churches” Pevsner,N/Bradley,S New Haven, Yale, 1998 The patronage of the church belonged to the abbess and convent of Barking, Essex until the Dissolution, when it passed to the Crown.

As traditionally defined, it is one of the most widespread primates in the Neotropics, but it has recently been recommended considering the black- striped, black and golden-bellied capuchins as separate species in a new genus, thereby effectively limiting the tufted capuchin to the Amazon basin and nearby regions. The tufted capuchin is an omnivorous animal, mostly feeding on fruits and invertebrates, although it sometimes feeds on small vertebrates (e.g. lizards and bird chicks) and other plant parts. It can be found in many different kinds of environment, including moist tropical and subtropical forest, dry forest, and disturbed or secondary forest. Like other capuchins, it is a social animal, forming groups of 8 to 15 individuals that are led by an alpha or dominant male. == Taxonomy and phylogeny == At one point all tufted capuchins were classified as Cebus apella. Under such taxonomy, the range of C. apella would extend throughout much of South America from Colombia to northern Argentina. More recent taxonomic studies have been carried out by Torres de Assumpção (1983; Torres 1988). Groves (2005) recognized the following subspecies for the tufted capuchins: *Cebus apella apella (Linnaeus, 1758) *Cebus apella fatuellus (Linnaeus, 1766) *Large-headed capuchin, Cebus apella macrocephalus Spix, 1823 *Cebus apella margaritae Hollister, 1914 *Cebus apella peruanus Thomas, 1901 *Cebus apella tocantinus Lönnberg, 1939 In 2011, Jessica Lynch Alfaro et al proposed that the robust capuchins such (formerly the C. apella group) be placed in a separate genus, Sapajus, from the gracile capuchins (formerly the C. capucinus group) which retain the genus Cebus. == Physical characteristics == Skeleton The tufted capuchin is more powerfully built than the other capuchins, with rougher fur and a long, thick tail. It has a bundle of long, hardened hair on the forehead that can be raised as a sort of \\"wig\\". The fur is brownish gray, with the belly being somewhat lighter-colored than the rest of the body. The hands and feet are black. The tail is prehensile: strong and can be used for grasping, as an extra limb. The tufted capuchin has a head-body length of , a tail length of , and a weight of , with the males generally being larger and heavier than the females. == Behaviour and ecology == Male tufted capuchin The tufted capuchin is a diurnal, arboreal primate species, but it often forages on the ground to search for food or to walk longer distances between trees that are too far apart to jump. The tufted capuchin lives in groups of two to twenty or more animals. A single group usually contains at least one adult male, but mixed groups with multiple males do also occur. In that case, one of the males is dominant. He accepts only a few monkeys in his direct surroundings, mainly younger animals and a few females. The dominant male and the group members that are close to him have the privilege to eat first in case of food scarcity, while subordinate monkeys have to wait until they are ready. After a gestation period of 180 days, one young is born, or incidentally a twin. This young, which weighs only 200 to 250 grams, is carried on the back of its mother. The mother feeds her child for 9 months, but the young are sexually immature until its seventh year, which is quite late for a primate of its size. Important natural enemies of the capuchin are large birds of prey. They are so afraid of those birds, that they even become alarmed when a harmless bird flies over. The tufted capuchin rubs urine on its hands and feet in order to attract mates and reduce stress. === Diet === A recently discovered characteristic of one population of this species is that it uses stones as a tool to open hard nuts. First it chooses ripe nuts from a nut palm. It uses its teeth to strip off the nut's fibrous husk. Then it leaves the nut to dry for about a week. When the nut is dry, the monkey lays the nut on a large, flat rock or fallen tree, hammering the nut with a suitable stone until the nut cracks. The hammerstones are often large enough to require lifting with both hands. The anvil rock is often pockmarked with hollows as a result of repeated use.Discovery \\"Life\\" series, \\"Challenges of Life\\" episode, David Attenborough Besides nuts, the capuchin also eats fruit, insects and larvae, eggs and young birds, frogs, lizards, rodents and even bats. They are also known to chase cats. The tufted capuchin looks for its food in groups. As soon as one of the group members has found something edible, he or she may make a large whistling sound, dependent upon the proximity of other individuals and abundance of the food resource so that the other monkeys know that there is something to eat. The composition of the group is very well organized and is determined by rank in the hierarchy. The dominant male often resides somewhere in the middle of the group just behind the front line, so that it is safer when a predator attacks. The vanguard is composed of higher-ranked females who are tolerated by the dominant male. They have the privilege to reach the food first, but they are also the most vulnerable when a predator attacks. === Tool use and manufacture === The tufted capuchin has been observed using containers to hold water, using sticks (to dig nuts, to dip for syrup, to catch ants, to reach food), using sponges to absorb juice, using stones as hammer and chisel to penetrate a barrier and using stones as hammer and anvil to crack nuts. While some of these tasks are relatively simple by cognitive standards (e.g. using a stick to catch ants), others, like cracking nuts with hammer and anvil are only exceeded in complexity by chimpanzees. The potential for tool use in animals like the tufted capuchin depends on a number of conditions that would increase its likelihood of appearing in a given species. Van Schaik proposed that the occurrence of tool use would be likely in foraging species if three factors were present: manual dexterity, intelligence, and social tolerance. As it applies to manual dexterity, capuchins are capable of a limited precision grip (the ability to delicately pinch and manipulate objects with the thumb and fingertips), which is not found in any other New World monkeys and only found in limited amounts in apes. C. apella has an encephalization ratio greater than the hominids (except humans) and a neocortex ratio that is almost as large as the apes; both of these rough indicators suggest high intelligence. Finally, the tufted capuchin forms social groups typical of a complex and tolerant society. The tufted capuchin has been observed manufacturing tools both in captivity and in the wild. In captivity, it has been reported as making probing sticks to reach normally inaccessible containers with syrup. It is also capable of understanding the concept of \\"sponging\\" and using paper towels, monkey biscuits, sticks, leaves and straw to sop up juice and then suck on the sponge to consume the juice. Research in the wild has shown that capuchin tool use is every bit as extensive as in captivity with capuchins being observed using stones to dig holes to get at tubers, an activity previously only seen in humans. The practice of using stones to crack nuts has arisen spontaneously in many locations such as in the Caatinga Dry Forest and Serra da Capivara National Park, all in Brazil and hundreds of miles apart. It has been observed cracking various nuts and fruits such as palm nuts (Attalea and Astrocaryum spp.) and jatobá fruits.(Hymenaea courbaril) The tufted capuchin has even been observed using stones to dislodge other stones that would later be used as hammers or shovels, an example of a more complex tool using behavior known as second-order tool use previously only found in chimpanzees. Curiously, not all tufted capuchins engage in tool use. Moura and Lee (2004) suggest lack of other food sources as the key factor. Ottoni and Mannu (2001), Fragaszy et al. (2004) and Visalberghi et al. (2005) have proposed this is likely more a factor of a monkey's terrestrial habit: the more time a monkey spends on the ground, the more likely it is to profit from (and thus engage in) tool use. In captivity, the tufted capuchin has been seen to manufacture stone tools that produced simple flakes and cores. Some of the capuchins even used these sharpened stones to cut (in a back-and-forth motion) barriers in order to reach food. The importance of this behavior is that it serves as evidence of mechanical proclivity to modify stones by using behaviors already in the monkeys' repertoires, and this behavior is seen as a precursor to stone-knapping. This early and limited tool use behavior has been hypothesized as similar to pre-Homo habilis and that artifacts of that time would probably resemble those of capuchins. S. apella tool manufacture and use has been analyzed for potential clues to social learning and problem solving ability, as tool manufacture and use can often shed light on such complex cognitive abilities. Social learning, or the ability to learn from other individuals, is a controversial topic in most nonhuman species like S. apella because of the relative difficulty of determining whether a behavior was learned from imitation or a much simpler form of social learning. One way of closing the gap between concurrent tool related behaviors and their likelihood of arising from imitation is by narrowing down events that would make social learning more probable such as a preference for observing experienced tool users. In this regard, Ottoni and his team found that young capuchins tended to observe the best tool users when cracking nuts.An example of the Doorian Fruit, a box that can open in one of two ways (see image for more info). Another way of isolating imitation from other simpler behaviors is to present the capuchins with a box that has food but has two different ways of opening it. The important point is that neither way should be more advantageous so that the monkey can freely choose one. In one such study, when humans opened the door in front of the monkeys using one way only, the monkeys used that method, even when they discovered the alternative on their own. In another study, capuchin alphas from two separate groups were trained to open the door in a specific way, after which the monkeys were paired with subordinates who learned to open the door in the same way. When capuchins are trained in the same way and this time released into their groups, the habit is once again disseminated amongst all group members even when others discover alternative ways. Nevertheless, the subject of whether or not S. apella learns by imitation is still controversial, because of the inherent difficulty in teasing out unambiguous evidence of a complex cognitive process such as imitation. === Problem solving === Tool use and manufacture can also shed light on the many aspects of the tufted capuchin's cognitive abilities by determining how it solves some problems. Some non-primates manufacture and use objects as tools. Crows are known to make hook-tools for catching insects, but such activities lack the behavioral plasticity of tool use as evidenced in tufted capuchins who found new ways to use tools that other species could not. But this plasticity in tool use, while suggesting greater complexity and cognitive ability, does not suggest that the monkeys understand cause and effect. It instead implies they are only able to learn from successful efforts but not from failures nor are they able to refine and improve much. Its ability to repeat successes, coupled with its complex repertoire of behavioral events helps to explain the tufted capuchin's extensive repertoire of innovative behaviors besides tool use. == Distribution and habitat == This species lives in the northern Amazon rainforest of the Guyanas, Venezuela and Brazil and to the west of the Rio Negro, as far north as the Orinoco in Venezuela. It is also found in eastern Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, including the upper Andean Magdalena valley in Colombia. An introduced breeding population is well established in the northwestern peninsula of the island of Trinidad in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. It can be found in a large variety of forest types, mainly in tropical rainforests (up till a height of 2700 m), but also in more open forests. The distribution overlaps with that of other species of capuchins, such as the white-fronted capuchin (Cebus albifrons). == References == ==Further reading== *Notes on the taxonomy and distributions of the tufted capuchin monkeys (Cebus, Cebidae) of South America *Janson, Charles H.

The mother germoplasm of Citrus indica (locally known as Memang Narang) have been discovered by science researchers within Nokrek Range. This discovery led to the establishment of the National Citrus Gene Sanctuary-cum-Biosphere Reserve covering an area of forty-seven square kilometres. The area has wild varieties of citrus fruits that provide a gene-pool for commercially produced citrus. == Geography == The entire Biosphere Reserve is hilly. The rock is mainly gneisses, granulites, migmatites, amphibolites and banded iron formation, intruded by basis and ultra-basic bodies. In most of the Biosphere Reserve area the soil is red loam. But sometimes it varies from clayey to sandy loam. The soils in the Biosphere Reserve are rich in organic matter and nitrogen but deficient in phosphate and potash. The area consists of patchy sedimentary rock composed of pebble bed, sandstone, and carbonaceous shales. All important rivers and streams of the Garo Hills region rise from the Nokrek Range, of which the river Simsang, known as Someshwari when it emerges into Bangladesh at Baghmara, is the most prominent. == Notable sites == Notable sites in the park include the Nokrek Peak and Rongbang Dare Water Fall. Balpakram National Park and Siju Cave is located very close to the Napak Lake near the Simsang River game reserve which is south east to Nokrek National Park. The cave is filled with water and is miles long. == See also == * Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education == References == == Further reading == * Management Action Plan of Nokrek National Park for 2012-13 to 2016-17 published by the Divisional Forest Officer, East & West Garo Hills Wildlife Division, Tura == External links == * \\"Protected Area Gazette Notification Database (Meghalaya)\\" * * WebIndia123 - National parks of Meghalaya Category:National parks in Meghalaya Category:Biosphere reserves of India Category:Protected areas of Meghalaya Category:West Garo Hills district ","title":"Nokrek National Park"},{"id":"3228206","text":"The International Weightlifting Federation (IWF), headquartered in Budapest, is the international governing body for the sport of Olympic weightlifting.

It has an area of . It was declared in 1993 as the twenty second Tiger reserve of India and the fifth in Madhya Pradesh, Panna was given the Award of Excellence in 2007 as the best maintained national park of India by the Ministry of Tourism of India. It is notable that by 2009, the entire tiger population had been eliminated by poaching with the collusion of forest department officials. It was designated as Biosphere Reserve on 25 August 2011.Sal, crocodile bark, Arjun, jamun, etc. are trees present here. ==Biome== Panna National Park and the surrounding territorial forest area of North and South Panna forest division is the only large chunk of wildlife habitat remaining in North Madhya Pradesh in the otherwise deciduous fragmented forest landscape of the region. The National Park is situated at a point where the continuity of the Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests belt, which starts from Cape Comorin in South India, is broken and beyond this the Upper Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests of the great Indo-Gangetic Plain begins. This area is the northernmost tip of the natural teak forests and the easternmost tip of the natural 'Kardhai' Anogeissus pendula forests. The forests of Panna National Park along with Ken Gharial Wildlife Sanctuary and adjoining territorial divisions form a significant part of the catchment area of the Ken River which runs northeast for about through the park. ==Fauna== Among the animals found here are the tiger, leopard, chital, chinkara, nilgai, sambhar and sloth bear. The park is home to more than 200 species of birds including the bar-headed goose, honey buzzard, king vulture, blossom-headed parakeet, changeable hawk- eagle and Indian vulture. ==Tiger reserve== Panna National Park was declared as one of the Tiger reserves of India in 1994/95 and placed under the protection of Project Tiger. The decline of tiger population in Panna has been reported several times. Two female tigers were relocated there from Bandhavgarh National Park and Kanha National Park in March 2009. However, the last male tiger had already disappeared. A committee to look into the disappearance of the tigers was formed. In June 2009, it was officially announced that the Reserve, which had over 40 tigers six years earlier, had no tigers left and only two tigresses, which were brought in a little earlierIt's official: Panna reserve has no tiger The Times of India, 14 June 2009. In February 2012, only three years later, the entire tiger population of the reserve was considered eliminated. The Madhya Pradesh government did not determine responsibility for the debacle, nor did it pass the inquiry to the Central Bureau of Investigation in spite of requests from the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Prime Minister's Office. The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) approved a proposal to translocate two tigers and two tigresses to the reserve. One female each from Bandhavgarh National Park (coded T1) and Kanha National Park (T2) were translocated to Panna Tiger Reserve. A tiger male, coded T3, was brought from Pench Tiger Reserve but strayed out of the park shortly thereafter, in November 2009 The tiger started walking towards its home in Pench National Park, indicating homing instinct. It moved steadily through human dominated landscape without causing any conflict. Forest department staff tracked it continuously for over a month and finally brought it back to the Panna Tiger Reserve. It then settled well, established territory and started mating. The tigress, T1, translocated from Bandhavgarh National Park, gave birth to four cubs in April 2010 of which 2 survive till date. The second tigress, T2, translocated from Kanha National Park gave birth to four cubs several months later and all four survive till date. A third tigress, coded T4, an orphaned cub was reintroduced to Panna in March 2011. She learnt hunting skills with the help of the male and mated with him. She was found dead on 19 September 2014 of an infection caused by its radio collar. Her sister T5 was released in Panna in November 2011. Thus four tigers and around 10 cubs of up to 2 years are settled in Panna Tiger Reserve at present and their progress is being regularly monitored by the Forest Department. ==Effect of Ken Betwa River Linking Project== The Government of India along with Government of Madhya Pradesh and Government of Uttar Pradesh have planned to link the Ken River with Betwa River. This involves construction of 283km long Daudhan Dam. The project aims to transfer excess water from Ken basin to Betwa basin thus provide water access to the drought prone region of Bundelkhand. This construction will cause inundation of 400 hectares of land of 4300 hectare Panna Tiger reserve. Environmentalist are afraid that this will adversely affect the population of tigers in the region. ==References== ==External links== * Map of the Reserve * Category:Tiger reserves of India Category:Panna, India Category:Bundelkhand Category:National parks in Madhya Pradesh ","title":"Panna National Park"},{"id":"3228253","text":"Brian Warwick Goorjian (born ) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is the head coach of The Hawks of the National Basketball League (NBL). He is the winningest coach in Australian basketball and his career has been called the most successful in NBL history by Basketball Australia. In an NBL coaching career spanning over 20 years, Goorjian has won six championships: two with the South East Melbourne Magic, three with the Sydney Kings and one with the South Dragons. He served as the head coach of the Australia men's national basketball team from 2001 to 2008. In 2009, Goorjian became the head coach of the Dongguan Leopards of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and stayed with the team for six seasons. He served as an assistant coach for the Guangdong Southern Tigers from 2015 to 2016 and as a special advisor to the Shanghai Sharks from 2016 to 2018. Goorjian returned to coaching duties when he joined the Xinjiang Flying Tigers in 2018 as an assistant coach for one season. After spending a decade in the CBA, he returned to the NBL in 2020 as the head coach of the Hawks. == Early career == Brian Goorjian was born in Glendale, California. Goorjian first arrived in Australia in 1977 and played for Port Melbourne Baseball club under coach Frank Thier, he later went on to play Basketball for the Melbourne Tigers under Lindsay Gaze.Brian Goorjian celebrityspeakers.com In 1984 he captained the Melbourne Tigers in their first National Basketball League season. Goorjian's coaching career began in 1985 as assistant coach with the Geelong Supercats. == Coaching career == === Eastside Spectres (1988–1991) === Goorjian's first head coaching job came in 1988 when he coached the Eastside Melbourne Spectres. The team missed the finals in Goorjian's first two seasons (amazingly, in 22 seasons these two would be the only times a Goorjian-coached team did not qualify for the play-offs and play at least Semi-finals).Why Goorjian is king of the court The Age, March 19, 2005 In 1990, the Spectres bowed out in the semi-finals and the next year they went one better by making the Grand Final for only the second time in the club's history (they had lost the 1981 Grand Final (as the Nunawading Spectres) to the Launceston Casino City Tigers). They lost this final to the defending champion Perth Wildcats, however in the off-season the team merged with the Southern Melbourne Saints to form the South East Melbourne Magic with Goorjian named as the new Magic coach. === South East Melbourne Magic (1992–1998) === Success at the Magic came instantly, as Goorjian won the first of his six championships, and the first of his six Lindsay Gaze Coach of the Year awards, in 1992. The 1992 Grand Final series against the Lindsay Gaze coached Melbourne Tigers saw the Magic emerge with a 2–1 series win. Three consecutive semi-final losses were followed by a second championship, and another Coach of the Year award, in 1996 when they again defeated the Tigers in a series where all three games were played at the league's then largest venue, the 15,300 capacity National Tennis Centre which was home to both clubs, and drew the still standing (as of 2016–17) record aggregate Grand Final attendance of 43,605 (average 14,535) fans. Two Grand Final losses were to follow in 1997 (Tigers) and in 1998 to the Adelaide 36ers who had a rookie coach in Australian basketball legend Phil Smyth, and who surprisingly to that point had only ever recorded one win over the Magic since 1992. The 1998 Magic team was hailed as one of the NBL's best ever teams after going 26–4 through the regular season and easily sweeping the Brisbane Bullets in their Semi-final series, but were swept 2–0 by the 36ers in a stunning capitulation. The 1998 Magic team was loaded with talent, including Australian Boomers players John Dorge, Brett Wheeler, Tony Ronaldson and Sam Mackinnon as well as captain Jason Smith, Frank Drmic and the NBL's 1998 Best Defensive Player Award winner Mike Kelly. Also on that team was Billy Mccaffrey. The Magic lost Game 1 100–93 in Adelaide before being mauled 90–62 in Game 2 at the Tennis Centre. While the Magic under Goorjian were seen as the best team in the NBL at the time, it must be said that the 36ers were also a very talented team, boasting former NBL MVP and Grand Final MVP Mark Davis, former Perth championship forward Martin Cattalini, North Melbourne Giants 1994 Grand Final MVP Paul Rees, former Denver Nuggets NBA players Darnell Mee and Kevin Brooks, team captain and Aussie Boomers point guard Brett Maher as well as two time NBL championship winner (ironically winning one each with both the 36ers (1986) and Magic (1992)) Scott Ninnis.Adelaide 36ers 1998 Champions - The Finals Following the loss to the 36ers, Goorjian had another change of team by merger, this time due to the Magic merging with cross-town rivals the North Melbourne Giants to form the Victoria Titans. === Victoria Titans (1998–2002) === Amazingly, the agony was to continue for Goorjian as his two Grand Final losses at the Magic were followed by two more Grand Final losses at the Titans, making a total of four consecutive Grand Final defeats for Goorjian. The Titans lost 2–1 to defending champions Adelaide in 1998–99 (the first NBL summer season after the league decided that it did not want to compete for fan support against the various winter football codes), before being swept 2–0 by the Perth Wildcats in 1999–2000. Aside from being the only coach in Australian history to lose four consecutive grand finals, he was unable to add to his trophy cabinet at the Titans as two semi- final eliminations followed. At the end of the 2001–02 season, the financially struggling Victoria Titans went into administration and were sold to new owners associated with the former North Melbourne Giants, who controversially fired Goorjian who by this time was regarded as not only the best basketball coach in Australia but the southern hemisphere. === Sydney Kings (2002–2008) === The Sydney Kings capitalised on the Titans' controversial decision to part ways with Goorjian after the 2002 season, and he moved north to replace the San Antonio Spurs-bound Brett Brown. What followed was a period of success unrivalled in Sydney's history. Three titles came in the space of four seasons as the Kings swept all before them, becoming the first NBL team to win 3 consecutive championships in 2002–03, 2003–04 and 2004–05 before finishing as beaten Grand Finalists in 2005–06 and 2007–08. Goorjian, who had brought his captain Jason Smith with him from the Titans, coached Sydney to five Grand Final series in six years, despite being forced to constantly re-build the team after each season. He won his fifth Coach of the Year award (an Australian record) as the Kings went 27-3 during the 2007-08 regular season.Goorj named NBL's best However, they were unable to turn this success into a fourth championship, going down narrowly to the Melbourne Tigers. ===South Dragons (2008–2009) === On April 1, 2008, Goorjian signed a three- year contract with new Melbourne club South Dragons,Goorj completes Dragons move foxsports.com.au April 1, 2008 and signed Mark Worthington from his Sydney Kings squad to join him at the Dragons.Smith vows to breathe new life By Grantley Bernard April 16, 2008 Goorjian led the Dragons to the 2008–09 NBL title (the club's inaugural and as it turned out, only NBL championship) in his first season with them. Unfortunately, the South Dragons folded at the end of the season despite their title win, prompting Goorjian to seek a position overseas. He won his sixth Coach of the Year award with the Dragons in 2009. ===Dongguan Leopards (2009–2015)=== Brian Goorjian was the head coach of the Dongguan Leopards. After the 2014-2015 CBA Season ended, Goorjian left the Leopards. ===Guangdong Tigers (2015–2016)=== Goorjian stepped away from head coaching duties, and became associate coach of the Guangdong Southern Tigers in early 2015, responsible for player development, talent identification, scouting and game analysis. ===Shanghai Sharks (2016–2018)=== After the CBA season has finished, Goorjian became Special Advisor of the Shanghai Sharks in early 2016, responsible for player development, talent identification, scouting and game analysis. Following the 2017-2018 season he left the club. ===Xinjiang Flying Tigers (2018–2019)=== After leaving the Sharks, Goorijan moved to the Xinjiang Flying Tigers in 2018 as an assistant coach, and remained there for one season. ===The Hawks (2020–present)=== On June 23, 2020, returned to Australia and signed with the The Hawks of the NBL as their new head coach. ==National team career == After Phil Smyth's less than one- year term as the Australian Boomers coach in 2001 which resulted in the team's shock non-qualification for the 2002 World Championships, Goorjian was appointed as coach in late 2001 when Smyth resigned and would hold the position until 2008. By becoming the Boomers coach, Goorjian was the first foreign born coach to the team in its history. Under his tutelage, the Boomers qualified for the 2004 Athens Olympics, where they finished ninth, dropping five places from their 2000 finish. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the boomers improved their ranking to finish 7th. == Coaching profile == Having won 511 games at a winning percentage of 70% Goorjian's record exceeds that of Australian coaching legends in the other major professional leagues including Kevin Sheedy (AFL - 365), Allan Jeans (AFL - 358), Tom Hafey (AFL - 336), David Parkin (AFL - 306), Wayne Bennett (NRL - 294 wins) and Tim Sheens (NRL - 235). In 2003 the NBL Hall of Fame selection committee voted Brian Goorjian the best coach of the first 25 years of the National Basketball League. In one of the notable statistics in sport, Goorjian-coached teams finished no worse than the semi-finals every year from 1990–2009. He has also coached teams to a record 12 grand finals and won 'Coach of the Year' on six occasions. Goorjian is also known for his intense coaching style (contrasting the laid back style of his early mentor Lindsay Gaze). His former assistant coach Bill Tomlinson says the detail he paid to defence was notable, as was the emphasis on strength and conditioning which often made Goorjian coached teams the fittest in the league.That winning feeling for long time coach Brian Goorjian He said he sat down for his first six games in 1988, which he lost, and has stood during games ever since.The Life of Brian Goorjian The Canberra Times, September 2006 On October 10, 2013, Goorjian was named the coach of the Sydney Kings 25th Anniversary Team.MightyMite Sydney Kings announce 25th Anniversary Team ==Coaching record== ===NBL=== -

The libretto was written by a school teacher named Marina Stanislavovna Polʹ, using Russian folk tales. The title can be translated also as The Snow Hero or The Snow Knight, but these renderings do not quite convey the notion of a Bogatyr. As with the composer's other children's operas, this work was meant for children to perform in, as well as to watch. ==Performance history== The opera was premiered on 15 May 1906 (Old Style), in Yalta, by school students of Ms. Pol', who accompanied the performance at the piano. It was staged also on 4 March 1908 in Saint Petersburg, by opera students at the St. Petersburg Conservatory. Like one of the composer's other children's operas, Puss in Boots, this opera seems to have had some staying power, or at least potential, in Soviet times, judging by the fact that it was re-published in 1953—with a new libretto devoid of tsarist allusions. ==Characters and Setting== (Characters as listed in the original edition) *Tsaritsa: soprano *Ivan Tsarevich (The Snow Bogatyr): low mezzo-soprano *The Dragon Gorynych: alto or bass (bass preferred) *11 Princess-Swans: children's chorus *Nurses and mothers: children's chorus Setting: Fairytale times. A certain kingdom, a certain domain. ==Synopsis== (As in the original edition) Tableau 1. A courtyard. The Princess-Swans are singing and dancing. As they enjoy a snowball fight, they inadvertently hit their mother, the Tsaritsa, in the eyes. She rashly wishes not only to have a son, but also that a whirlwind would sweep away her eleven disobedient daughters. Suddenly there is a blizzard, and the Princess-Swans are swept away. But out of the snowstorm appears the son that the Tsaritsa wished for—the Snow Bogatyr. He promises her that he will find his new sisters. Tableau 2. A forest. The Princesses are being kept in a peasant's hut that stands on hen's legs (see Baba Yaga). After three attempts, the Snow Bogatyr finally defeats a three-headed Dragon to rescue his new sisters. All join in the opening round-dance as the Snow-Bogatyr urges them homeward. ==Bibliography== *Bernandt, G.B.

It is part of the Plano Independent School District, and enrolls students based on the locations of students' homes. Students at Plano East attended one of two high schools: McMillen or Williams. The school colors are black and gold, and the school mascot is the panther. Plano East has been awarded the U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon School of Excellence, Best High School in Texas designation by Redbook magazine,Weiss, Michael J (April 1996). \\"America's Best High Schools\\". Redbook p.66 Texas Education Agency Blue Ribbon School, and State and National Academic Decathlon Championships. Plano East's graduating classes are among the largest for high schools in the United States. Plano East's Class of 2005, with 1220 graduates, was the largest high school graduating class in the U.S. that year. The Class of 2014 was also the largest high school graduating class in the U.S., with 1561 graduates. Plano East is the only senior high school in Plano ISD to offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. Students who would normally attend either Plano or Plano West are allowed to transfer to Plano East to participate in the IB Programme without forfeiting UIL eligibility. Beginning with the 2014–2015 school year, Plano East became the 2nd campus to host part of the Plano ISD Health Sciences Academy for Juniors and Seniors after the Health Sciences Academy was established in the 2013–2014 school year at Williams High School for Freshmen and Sophomores. ==History== Buildings B2, B3, and B4 as seen from the bridge To meet the demand of the growing population in Plano, Plano East Senior High School opened in 1981 as the second senior high school in the city. The school opened with 3 academic buildings connected by second- floor walkways, a fine arts building, and a gymnasium. The athletics complex was added as a result of Title IX laws which require equal space for male and female athletics. In 1987, a new student activity center was constructed for indoor athletic practice. Eventually, fourth and fifth buildings were also added. The construction project for Building Five (the science wing) concluded the fall of 2010, preceding the 2010–2011 academic school year. An extension to Building 1 was completed in the fall of 2018 and included 19 classrooms, 4 smaller rooms, a large meeting room, and several collaboration spaces.http://www.wraarchitects.com/portfolio-buildings/2017/2/12/plano-east- senior-high ==Rivalries== The school has had a rivalry with the oldest high school in the city, Plano Senior High School. However, in the 21st century Plano West Senior High School has become the nemesis to both Plano and Plano East. As a result, Plano East has developed a fierce rivalry with their cross town counterparts, the Plano West Wolves. Plano East also maintains a rivalry with Allen High School to the north because they are the two largest schools in the state. ==Athletics== ===Football=== District Champs: 1985 12-5A, 1988 12-5A, 1994 11-5A, 1998 9-5A, 1999 9-5A, 2000 9-5A In 1994, Plano East was on the losing end of a wild and memorable regional semi final game against John Tyler High School in which five touchdowns were scored in the last two and a half minutes (courtesy of three consecutive successful onside kicks, followed by a regular kickoff returned for a touchdown).

In March 2016, the Plano East Men's Choir was selected to perform at the Southwest Division of the American Choral Directors Association in Kansas City, Missouri. ===Theatre=== Plano East offers multiple distinct theatre-related programs, including: an advanced Technical Theatre (AT) program, a Theatre Major Studies (TMS) program, a Theatre Honors Production (THP) program, a Musical Theatre Production (MTP) program, a Drama Intensive (DI) program, and an IB Theatre program. The Plano East Drama Department is headed by Brian Grunkowski, the director, and Zizi Wright, the technical director. All students are able to take advantage of experts that are brought in for workshops, particularly professionals from neighboring Southern Methodist University, UT Dallas and Collin College, as well as attend the North Texas Drama Auditions if they are in the 12th grade. The Advanced Technical Theatre students participate in all department productions while learning lighting, set design, stage managing, and sound design. All advanced tech students send submissions into the annual state UIL design competition. In the 2012 season, under the direction of Zachary Elms, the technical theatre department received six nominations at the state UIL design competition, scoring wins with fifth place in publicity, and fifth place in set design. Plano East also took home the top prize in set design. All Technical Theatre students are led by Brian Grunkowski, who stepped in as technical director after Zachary Elms left at the end of the 2014-2015 year. Theatre Major Studies is a double block, audition only class, where students focus primarily on performance and script analysis. Students are taught the techniques of Stanislavski, while also learning various movement based skills, such as Viewpoints. Theatre Honors Production is a single period, audition only class and is similar in structure to the TMS class. Brand new to Plano East, the Musical Theatre Production class was established in 2016 by Brian Grunkowski. Students learn about the history of musicals from script to Broadway, while learning choreography from different musicals, singing various showtunes, and exploring the musical side of theatre. This class is also audition only and takes place for one period (5th). The Drama Intensive program is an audition only program set up for IB World School students in the 9th and 10th grade. Geared to help students get ready for either TMS, THP, or IB, the DI class is involved in the Plano 9th/10th One Act as well as producing their own, unique Drama Intensive show utilizing these students. Set up for students involved in the IB World School the IB Theatre program allows to earn their SL or HL in this class by learning about Dramaturgy and various styles of theatre across the globe which ultimately culminates in a performance in the Courtyard Theatre at the end of the year, allowing students to showcase their talents by demonstrating a piece they've written by themselves after researching a style of theatre. The theatre department produces twelve major productions each school year: A Theatre Major Studies show (limited to students in the program), a Theatre Honors Production show (limited to students in the program), the 9th/10th One Act, an open audition musical, a Drama Intensive show (limited to students in the program), six senior-directed one act plays, and the open audition one act. Plano East's one-act competes annually in the state UIL One-Act Play Competition every spring. In 2006, under the direction of Lisa Hale, Plano East won the state championship for their production of The Marriage of Bette and Boo. ==Recognition== * U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon School of Excellence in 1992-1993 and 1997-98 * Texas State and U.S. National Academic Decathlon Champions * Redbook magazine Award for the \\"Best High School in Texas\\", 1994, 1996 * Texas Education Agency Blue Ribbon School, 1997 ==Alumni== * Lance Armstrong, attended PESH but not an alumnus, graduated from Bending Oaks High School; former professional cyclist and founder of Lance Armstrong Foundation * Jake Arrieta, MLB pitcher, 2016 World Series champion, 2015 winner of Cy Young Award * Wes Bankston, former MLB first baseman for Oakland A's * Justin Blalock, former NFL offensive guard for Atlanta Falcons and 2005 national champion Texas Longhorns, recipient of Watkins Award, inducted into Plano Athletic Hall of Honor * Spencer Boldman, actor, played Adam on Disney XD's Lab Rats * Jake Brendel, NFL center for Miami Dolphins * Stefani Carter (Class of 1996), Republican member of Texas House of Representatives from Dallas County District 102 from 2011 to 2015 * Jimmy King, University of Michigan basketball star for \\"Fab Five\\"; played in NBA for Toronto Raptors and Denver Nuggets * Muhammed Lawal, mixed martial arts fighter and 2010 Strikeforce light heavyweight champion * John Leake, former NFL linebacker for Atlanta Falcons * Thomas Mann, actor * Guy Mezger, former Plano East wrestler, mixed martial arts fighter and UFC champion * Lee Nguyen, 2005 Gatorade High School Soccer Player of the Year, midfielder for Los Angeles FC of Major League Soccer * Toben Opurum, former NFL running back * Candice Patton (Class of 2003), actress, plays Iris West in The CW television series The Flash and Tori in BET series The Game * Charlie Peprah, former NFL defensive back, member of Super Bowl XLV champion Green Bay Packers * Keenan Robinson, former NFL linebacker for Washington Redskins and New York Giants * Cara Santa Maria, science educator * Nicolas Valcik, 1989, author, researcher, and Executive Director of Institutional Effectiveness at Central Washington University, former director of Institutional Research at West Virginia University, and former associate director in Office of Strategic Planning and Analysis at The University of Texas at Dallas * Terrence Wheatley, former NFL defensive back * Dave Williams, lead singer of Drowning Pool * Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security under Donald Trump * Matt Young, former MLB outfielder ==See also== * Plano Senior High School * Plano West Senior High School * List of high schools in Texas ==References== ==External links== * Plano East Senior High School *IB World School *Health Sciences Academy Category:International Baccalaureate schools in Texas Category:High schools in Plano, Texas Category:Plano Independent School District high schools ","title":"Plano East Senior High School"},{"id":"3228278","text":":This page refers to a collection of vehicles (typically automobiles) with a single owner.

He continued to play at first-class level only occasionally, sometimes for Kent and sometimes for other teams such as Harlequins, until the 1927 season when he was appointed captain of Kent and made 23 first-class appearances. During the 1927 season Evans scored 832 runs at an average of 25.21, including three hundreds, one of which was his highest score or 143 made against Lancashire. He won his Kent cap during the same season before going on to make his final nine first-class appearances the following year. In all, Evans made 36 first-class appearances for Kent and scored almost 3,500 runs in his first-class career. ==Military service== At the outbreak of the First World War Evans was approached to join the newly founded Intelligence Corps, having been identified as a good candidate as a result of his year spent in Germany after graduating from Oxford. He initially joined the mounted section of the Corps, but was injured in a motorcycle accident in France in September 1914. In February 1915 he was attached to No. 3 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps an observer. The squadron was the first to use aerial photography to record details of enemy positions with observers, such as Evans, taking images at low altitudes, often whilst under fire. In September 1915 he was awarded the Military Cross for continuing to observe whilst his aircraft was under attack from an enemy plane and was also Mentioned in Dispatches. In early 1916 he became a pilot and was active spotting German artillery positions during the Battle of the Somme. He and his observer, Lieutenant Long, were tasked with a series of continuous reconnaissance flights during July. On 16 July their aircraft malfunctioned and the pair were forced to land behind enemy lines and were captured by German forces after crash landing their plane to avoid it falling into enemy hands. Evans was made a prisoner of war (POW), initially at Clausthal in Germany. He escaped and came close to the Dutch border before being recaptured and sent to Ingolstadt with other officers who had made unsuccessful escapes. He made a series of escape attempts but was recaptured each time until, in 1917, he and another officer, Captain Buckley, escaped whilst being transferred to another prisoner of war camp. This time Evans' escape was successful when the pair reached Switzerland after walking for 18 nights. Rules prevented POWs returning to active service in the same theatre of war they had been captured in, so Evans was transferred to Egypt and then to Palestine where he took command, in January 1918, of 142 Squadron, a bomber squadron. In March 1918 he was again forced to land due to a malfunctioning plane and was captured by Arab tribesmen who handed him and two Australian airmen who had landed to attempt to rescue him, to Turkish troops. After an escape attempt Evans was transferred to Constantinople and then on to a POW camp. He bribed a doctor to have himself declared sick in order to be included in an exchange of officers between Turkish and British troops. He sailed to Alexandria in November 1918 and was awarded a bar to his Military Cross for his many escape attempts. Evans later wrote about his time as a POW in The Escaping Club. During the Second World War Evans was called into service in MI9, the branch of the War Office responsible for coordinating resistance activities and assisting airmen shot down behind enemy lines and escaping POWs. He helped develop guidelines for the escape of POWs, drawing on his experiences during the First World War. He landed in Normandy in July 1944, helping to secure POWs and evaders as Allied armies advanced across North West Europe. ==Family and later life== Evans' father, AH Evans, played 44 first- class cricket matches and his younger brother, Ralph, played five matches, including one for Hampshire. Evans married Marie Galbraith, an Irish concert violinist. Their son was the actor Michael Evans.\\"Young and Restless\\" actor Michael Evans dies at 87, Mercury News, 2007-09-26.

Gatski was one of the most heralded centers of his era. Known for his strength and consistency, he helped protect quarterback Otto Graham and open up running lanes for fullback Marion Motley as the Browns won seven league championships between 1946 and 1955. Gatski won an eighth championship after he was traded to the Detroit Lions in 1957, his final season. Gatski was born in West Virginia to a coal-mining family. He played for three years on his local high school team before attending Marshall University, where he continued to play football. He joined the U.S. Army in 1942 and went to fight in World War II. Upon his return in 1945, he played in a couple of games at Auburn University in Alabama, before officials found out he had attended and played for Marshall, and took classes. After graduating, he tried out and made the roster for the Browns, a team under formation in the new AAFC thanks to Johnny Brickels, the former Huntington High School football coach who knew Paul Brown (Ed Ulinski of Marshall also tried out, played and later coached the Browns) after another former Marshall player, Sam Clagg, alerted Brickels to the two players. Gatski played as a linebacker and backup center for most of his first two years before earning a spot as the starting center. He retained that position as Cleveland continued to dominate the AAFC, going 47-4-2 and winning four championships before the league dissolved and the Browns, the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Colts were absorbed by the NFL in 1950. Gatski and the Browns won the 1950, 1954 and 1955 titles, losing in the title game in 1951-52-53. He retired after the 1957 season when he won an eighth title with the Detroit Lions, never having missed a game or practice in his career. After leaving football, Gatski worked briefly as a scout for the Boston Patriots. He then joined a reform school in West Virginia as athletic director and head football coach, staying there until the school closed in 1982. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985. Marshall retired Gatski's number 72 in 2005, the only football number retired for the Thundering Herd. He died that year in a nursing home in West Virginia. In 2006, the East End Bridge in Huntington, West Virginia was renamed the Frank Gatski Memorial Bridge in his honor. ==Early life== Gatski was born in 1921 and raised in Farmington, West Virginia. His father and grandfather were immigrants from Poland, and most of the men in his family worked at the nearby Number Nine Coal Mine Camp. Gatski started at center for three years on his Farmington High School football team, which played on a cow pasture with no scoreboard, bleachers or game clock. He worked in the coal mines during the summers, and went to work in the mines full-time during his senior year in 1939. Gatski was reserved and aloof, but he was also known as a graceful dancer. \\"I used to dance a lot in Farmington,\\" he said in 1949. \\"But I like polkas better than jitterbugging.\\" ==College and military career== In 1940, Marshall University coach Cam Henderson offered Gatski a chance to attend the West Virginia school on a football scholarship. Gatski accepted. He joined the junior varsity team, where he was the starting center for a season before moving to Marshall's varsity football team in 1941. He started 17 games at center and linebacker beginning in 1941, when Marshall posted a 7–1 record. The team faltered the following year, falling to 1–7–1 as its best players went to serve in the military. Gatski signed up for an Army reserve unit after the 1942 season as America's involvement in World War II intensified. Marshall canceled its football program in 1943 as Gatski entered his senior year, but his unit was activated and he was sent with an infantry division to fight in the European theater of World War II. He went to England and followed American troops as they landed in Normandy and marched further into Europe. \\"I wasn't in any heavy fighting,\\" he later said. He was a Private First Class in the Army.Saturday Down South Gatski returned from duty in 1945, but Marshall had yet to resume its football program, so he enrolled at Auburn University in Alabama and finished out his studies, playing part of the season on the school's football team. \\"Marshall hadn't started back up, and I hadn't played football for two years,\\" he later explained. \\"I didn't want to sit around and do nothing, so I went to Auburn.\\" ==Professional career== When Gatski graduated, Sam Clagg, a teammate at Marshall, helped get him a tryout with the Cleveland Browns after contacting John Brickels, an assistant coach with West Virginia ties. The Browns were a new team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and were set to begin play in 1946. Gatski, who was working in the mines after graduating from Auburn, hitchhiked to Bowling Green, Ohio for the team's training camp. He did not consider a football career a certainty, and returning to the coal mines where his father had died in an accident was a distinct possibility. \\"I didn't know what was going to happen,\\" he said later. \\"I just went up there to see what would happen.\\" Gatski arrived in Bowling Green with the nickname \\"Gunner\\" for his strength and speed on the offensive line that he had acquired in Huntington. The center before Gatski at Marshall, Jim Roberts, was said to hit like a tail gunner, and that may have had something to do with Gatski picking up Gunner as his nickname and as the newest Herd center. Growing up in the rough surroundings of a West Virginia mining town had toughened him up, and he did not mind Cleveland coach Paul Brown's overbearing perfectionism. As a professional, he later said, \\"you're supposed to be able to take that crap.\\" Initially, Gatski's prospects of making the team looked dim. Brown had brought in veteran center Mo Scarry to be the starter. But Gatski proved his value to the team with his reliability and work ethic. He made the team and signed a $3,000 per year contract. Gatski played mostly as a backup to Scarry and as a linebacker in his first and part of his second season. He became the full-time starter at center in the 1948 season. The Browns, meanwhile, were an immediate success. The team won the AAFC championship every year from 1946-47-48-49, posting a perfect season of 14–0 in 1948 and losing only four games in four seasons. Gatski's role on the offensive line was to help protect quarterback Otto Graham from defenders when he went back to pass. He also helped push away defenders and create space for fullback Marion Motley to run47- in. The Browns merged into the more established National Football League (NFL) in 1950. Aided by Gatski's blocking, the offense and the team continued to succeed. Cleveland won the 1950 NFL championship, and reached the championship game in each of the following five seasons, winning again in 1954 and 1955. By the time the Browns entered the NFL, Gatski had developed a reputation for consistency, durability and toughness. Brown began keeping only one center on the roster – Gatski. Centers today would complain about that, Walt Michaels, who played with Gatski in the early 1950s, said in later years. Gatski, however, did not mind. \\"He would take all the snaps,\\" Michaels said. Gatski was a quiet man who liked to hunt. He practiced hitting targets with his bow and arrow at League Park in Cleveland, where the Browns trained during the season. He was one of the Browns \\"Filthy Five\\" players who did not wash their practice uniforms during the season. Brown called him one of the strongest men on the team's roster. Graham thought of him as sure protection against opposing linemen. Teammates called him an \\"iron man\\" and a \\"Rock of Gibraltar\\". He was named to All-Pro lists in all but one year between 1951 and 1955. The Browns struggled after Graham retired in 1956 and ended the regular season at 5–7, their first-ever losing record. After the season, Brown traded the 35-year-old Gatski to the Detroit Lions for a draft pick after Gatski asked for a raise. He only played in the 1957 season with the Lions. Detroit beat the Browns for the NFL championship that year. By the time he retired after the 1957 season, Gatski had won eight championships and played in 11 championship games in 12 seasons played, a professional football record and still best for any non- kicker/punter. Gatski did not miss a practice or a game during his 12 seasons in football. ==Later life and death== After retiring from football, Gatski was a scout for the Boston Patriots for two years before becoming head football coach and athletic director at the West Virginia Industrial School for Boys, a correctional facility for young offenders in Pruntytown, West Virginia. Gatski was tough with the tough kids he had at Prunytown, having them jump off a 20-foot cliff at the start of the season to prove they were tough enough. After an escape attempt by some of his players early in his career, Gatski started keeping his team on the field at halftime - scrimmaging his players against each other until the other team returned for the second half. He worked there until the school shut down in 1982. He hunted and fished in retirement, and was often difficult to reach. He lived on a mountain in West Virginia and did not have a telephone for many years. Gatski was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985 as part of a class that included Joe Namath, Pete Rozelle, O.J. Simpson, and Roger Staubach. Gatski said he had not expected to make it into the hall. He had not played for 28 years when he was selected by an old-timers committee. Two decades later, Marshall University retired Gatski's number 72 during a homecoming game against the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Gatski was the first and remains the only Marshall football player to be so honored. Gatski died on November 22, 2005, at a nursing home in Morgantown, West Virginia and was buried at the West Virginia National Cemetery in Grafton.Herald-Dispatch He was married and had seven children. The following year, the East End Bridge in Huntington, West Virginia was renamed the Frank Gatski Memorial Bridge during halftime of a Marshall- UTEP football game. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * * ==External links== * * Story on Gatski Memorial Bridge * Category:1921 births Category:2005 deaths Category:People from Farmington, West Virginia Category:American people of Polish descent Category:American football centers Category:American football linebackers Category:Auburn Tigers football players Category:Marshall Thundering Herd football players Category:Cleveland Browns (AAFC) players Category:Cleveland Browns players Category:Detroit Lions players Category:Eastern Conference Pro Bowl players Category:Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Players of American football from West Virginia ","title":"Frank Gatski"},{"id":"3228298","text":"Heytesbury Street (; ) is a tree-lined inner city street north of the South Circular Road, Portobello, Dublin, Ireland named after William à Court, 1st Baron Heytesbury (1789–1860), Lord Lieutenant 1844–46.

It adjoins Warwickshire to the east. The 2001 census gave a parish population of 945, mostly at Holt End. The parish includes the hamlet of Portway, adjacent to the A435 road. It adjoins the Redditch suburb of Church Hill and the civil parishes of Alvechurch, Tanworth-in-Arden, Mappleborough Green and Wythall. ==Manor== The estates of the Benedictine Pershore Abbey included lands at Beoleahe from the 10th century at the latest, when Edgar the Peaceful restored them to the monks in AD 972. The Domesday Book of 1086 records that the abbey held 21 hides of land at Beolege and Yardley. An ancient castle, of which very slight traces remain, belonged successively to the noble families of Mortimer, Beauchamp, and HollandVision of Britain. Roger Mortimer (died 1214), Lord of Wigmore first appears in the pipe roll for 1174–1175, when he owned land in Shropshire and Worcestershire, and his daughter Joan Mortimer (died 1225) married Walter de Beauchamp of Elmley, Worcestershire, according to the Annals of Worcester.Mortimer Family Page. In 1378 John Holland, First Duke of Exeter and Earl of Huntingdon was granted lands by his half-brother King Richard II which included Buley Castel, this part being forfeited on 14 April 1385, though other lands were restored to him elsewhere.The History Jar. The de Beauchamp family of Elmley Castle, ancestors of William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick, were mesne lords of the manor from the 12th century until about 1265, when they acquired the overlordship (superiority) from the abbey. In the 13th century the toponym was variously rendered Boleye, Beleg or Buley. The superiority of Beoley descended with the de Beauchamps until the death of Henry de Beauchamp, 1st Duke of Warwick in 1446, when it passed to his daughter Elizabeth, wife of George Nevill, 1st Baron Latimer. It is said to have remained with the Latimers until John Nevill, 4th Baron Latimer sold it in 1549. William Sheldon of Abberton, however, must have held a good part of the parish by feu, as he was established at Balford Hall in Beoley in the reign of Edward IV (1460–1483). In addition, he bought Benyt's Place in that parish in 1488. Sheldon supported the Yorkists at the battle of Bosworth in 1485, and as a result of the definitive Lancastrian victory there he was deprived of his property, but it was restored to him before he died in 1517.Victoria County History, vol. iv, p. 14, note 25. In his Inquisition Post Mortem, held at Pershore, it was said that Sheldon owned Balford Hall and seven other houses and 460 acres (186 ha) of land in Beoley, and more elsewhere in Worcestershire and Warwickshire. In his will he made bequests to the churches at Beoley and Abberton and to Pershore Abbey.Prerogative Court of Canterbury, 35 Holder. Sheldon was succeeded at Beoley by his son Ralph (died 1546), who was married to Philippa, daughter of Baldwin Heath of Ford Hall, Wootton Wawen. Ralph was imprisoned in the Marshalsea in 1580 for recusancy, but released on medical grounds. Ralph was succeeded at Beoley by his eldest son, William (c. 1500–1570), who possessed the manors of Weston, Warwickshire, Abberton (jointly with his brother Francis), and by then virtually the whole parish of Beoley: some 4000 acres (over 1600 ha). He was Receiver at the Court of Augmentations, Knight of the Shire for Worcestershire, and Sheriff of the same county. Around 1534, William Sheldon purchased 2,000 acres (809 ha) of land at Skilts, between Beoley and his mother's home Ford Hall – lands which had been a grange of Studley Priory. His magnificent tomb is in Beoley parish church. William Sheldon was succeeded by his son, another Ralph Sheldon (1537–1613), who was married to Anne, daughter of Sir Robert Throgmorton of Coughton, who had attended the reception of Anne of Cleves. A Roman Catholic, Ralph Sheldon was a courtier at the Court of Queen Mary, and for a time a courier for Mary Queen of Scots between her place of confinement and Scotland. He is frequently mentioned in State Papers as a recusant. In 1594 there is a reference to an alleged premeditated rebellion in North Wales, \\"the chiefest aid for which is to come from Ralph Sheldon,\\" and to his sending an emissary to Louvain \\"with letters to Cardinal Allen\\". He is said to have been responsible for the construction of the manor house at Weston Park in Warwickshire, another Sheldon estate in Long Compton parish. He was succeeded by his eldest son and heir, Edward (1561–1643), also a Royalist. In August 1636, Charles I of England visited Warwick, and a day or two later went on \\"to Weston at Mr. Sheldon's house with great delight\\". Edward's son and heir, William Sheldon of Beoley (1589–1659), always resided at Weston Park, where he died. In 1611, he married Elizabeth, daughter of the recusant William Petre, 2nd Baron Petre.E. A. B. Barnard, The Sheldons, 1936, p. 48 Considered \\"a man of literary taste\\", Sheldon was a Royalist and at various times during the early years of the Civil War he was, in his turn, harassed as \\"a Popish delinquent\\". After the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, Beoley was restored through Richard Sheldon to William's son, the antiquary Ralph Sheldon (1623-1684). He was married to Henrietta Maria, daughter of Thomas, 1st Viscount Savage, but had no issue.Barnard, 1936, pp. 54–56. Beoley then passed to a first cousin once removed, Ralph Sheldon, Lord of Beoley and Weston (1653–1720), who was married to Mary Anne, daughter of John Elliot of Gatacre Park, Shropshire. His estates passed to his eldest son and heir, Edward (1679–1746) and then to the latter's eldest son William (1715–1780). His son in turn, Ralph Sheldon, inherited Beoley in 1780, but by 1788 it was said to be heavily mortgaged and he sold the manor to a Thomas Holmes. Holmes separated Beoley Hall (see below) and of land from the rest of the manor and sold off both to separate buyers. ==Beoley Hall== The Sheldons' main manor house at Beoley was originally Balford Hall. In September 1643 William Sheldon's manor house at Weston Park was ransacked and cattle and goods \\"to a great value\\" taken away by soldiers. The following December his manor house at Beoley was burnt to the ground and all his goods and cattle \\"plundered by the soldiers.\\" In 1648 the Parliamentarian authorities sequestrated Beoley. It was restored to the Sheldons in 1660, who had the present Beoley Hall built after the Restoration, either late in the 17th or early in the 18th century. It is a neoclassical house with an H plan, originally entirely three-storeyed, built of brick and entirely stuccoed. In 1791 the new proprietor Thomas Holmes had the east wing rebuilt to plans by John Sanders, with two storeys built to the same height as the original three and a portico with four Tuscan columns. On the south end of the east wing, a bow window was added to the ground floor in 1791; a matching window was subsequently added to the first floor above. The main staircase is lit by a round skylight. In 1968 Beoley Hall was in poor condition, but since 1986 it has been a Grade II listed building, now divided into apartments. ==Parish church== The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of St Leonard date from the early part of the 12th century and include the chancel arch.St Leonard's Church The south arcade dates from the early or middle part of the 13th century and the north arcade from about 1300. The west tower is a Perpendicular Gothic addition from about 1400 and the north aisle was also rebuilt in the Perpendicular style. The Sheldon Chapel on the north side was added for the recusant Ralph Sheldon in about 1580. Its stone altar is said to be a gift from Pope Gregory XIII. The church was restored in 1885 and the Sheldon Chapel in 1891. The tower has a ring of eight bells. The oldest is the tenor bell, cast in 1601 by Hugh Watts of Leicester. The seventh bell was cast in 1611 by one of Leicester's Newcombe family of bellfounders. The fourth bell was cast in 1622 by Henry III Oldfield of Nottingham. Richard Sanders of Bromsgrove cast the third bell in 1708 and the fifth in 1709. John Rudhall of Gloucester cast the seventh bell in 1789, which completed a ring of six. In 1999 this was increased to eight by adding a treble and a second bell cast by Whitechapel Bell Foundry. ==Amenities== Beoley has a primary schoolBeoley First School and a village hall.Beoley Village Hall Its two pubs are the Cross and Bowling Green at Branson's Cross and the Village Inn at Holt End.The Village Inn, Beoley ==Notable people== In birth order: *Edward Sheldon (1599–1687), translator of Catholic religious works from French *Ralph Sheldon (1623–1694), Royalist and antiquary, nephew of Edward *Mary Whateley (1738–1835), poet and playwright writing as Harriett Airy and Mary Darwall (her married name) *Sarah Cooper (1848–1932), (née Gill), originator of Frank Cooper's Oxford marmalade *Sarah Bishop, previously Sarah Falkland, current journalist and relief news presenter for BBC Midlands Today ==References== ==External links== *Beoley Conservation Area Draft Character Appraisal and Management Plan (Bromsgrove District Council, 2014) ==Sources== * * Category:Civil parishes in Worcestershire Category:Villages in Worcestershire ","title":"Beoley"},{"id":"3228309","text":"Bob Greenlee (born July 6, 1941, in Omaha, Nebraska) is the executive director of the Greenlee Family Foundation.

In 1998, he ran a narrowly unsuccessfully race as a moderate pro-choice Republican against Mark Udall in 1998 for Colorado's 2nd Congressional District. He was educated at Iowa State University where he received his B.A. in 1963 and M.A. in 1968. After a career in advertising, he purchased several radio stations and co-founded what would become CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries, of which he is still a board member. He is President of Centennial Investment & Management Company, Inc., a Boulder-based venture capital and real estate firm, In 1997, Iowa State University initiated the Greenlee School of Journalism and Mass Communication in response to a large donation. He and his wife, Diane, have two children. In late December 2016, Greenlee was seriously injured in a highway accident in southern Colorado involving 5 vehicles. Another driver died and two other people were injured. Greenlee was driving the SUV that apparently started the chain reaction. ==2016 car accident== On Wednesday, December 28, 2016, Bob Greenlee and his wife were driving on U.S. 160 westbound across La Veta Pass between Walsenburg and Alamosa in their 2003 Cadillac Escalade. A high-speed passing maneuver by Greenlee apparently set off a chain reaction involving several passenger cars and a tractor trailer truck, resulting in one fatality, two serious injuries and five less-serious injuries. Everyone involved was wearing a seat belt and no one was ejected from a vehicle. Pat (Patricia) Lucero, 70, from Monte Vista died after the Toyota Camry she was driving was struck by Greenlee's vehicle, next hit a tractor trailer, then struck a Kia Spectra. The Greenlees' SUV also struck a BMW X5 head on, causing it to roll and land on its side. Both Greenlee and his wife suffered critical injuries and were hospitalized in two different facilities. In all, seven people were transported, by ground ambulance, to three different hospitals. The highway was closed for a few hours. Initial reports indicated speed was a contributing factor. Six weeks after the accident, a meeting between state patrol investigators and the District Attorney's office was being rescheduled and no charges had been filed. A week later, the news turned to aggressive driving and speed, as investigators reported Greenlee was \\"passing improperly\\" at 22 mph over the speed limit: 87 mph in a 65 mph zone. On Wednesday, Feb. 22, nine criminal charges were filed against Greenlee: two homicide charges - vehicular, criminally negligent - as well as vehicular assault, two counts of careless driving causing injury, reckless driving, speeding, reckless endangerment and improper passing on the left. Greenlee's court arraignment was set for Tuesday, Mar. 28 in Alamosa. The most serious of the nine charges - vehicular homicide, a Class 4 felony - could lead to a prison sentence of two to six years. In January 2018, Greenlee pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide and three other charges, with potential prison time of up 3 years. In late March 2018, Greenlee was sentenced in Costilla District Court to a year of home detention, a $100,000 fine, an annual charitable contribution of $100,000 for the ten-year probation term, and 200 hours of community service. Although the judge called Greenlee's role in the fatal accident \\"egregious… inexplicable conduct… inexcusable behavior\\", he felt that incarceration would essentially be a death sentence and would serve no purpose, and that the $1 million in charitable funds, to an entity selected by the prosecutor, would help the San Luis Valley community. ==Greenlee Family Foundation== The Greenlee Family Foundation is a \\"private grant-making organization.\\" Its mission is: \\"to encourage, preserve and promote the well-being, education, welfare and enlightenment of our fellow citizens by investing in creative people and ideas.\\" ==See also== * List of people from Colorado ==References== ==External links== * 1998 CNN Profile * Greenlee Family Foundation Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:Mayors of Boulder, Colorado Category:Iowa State University alumni Category:Colorado city council members ","title":"Bob Greenlee"},{"id":"3228316","text":"Henry Yelverton may refer to: * Henry Yelverton, 19th Baron Grey de Ruthyn (1780-1810), British peer * Henry Yelverton (merchant) (1821–1880), Australian timber merchant * Sir Henry Yelverton, 2nd Baronet (1633–1670), English politician * Henry Yelverton (Australian politician) (1854–1906), Member of the Western Australian Legislative Council from 1901 to 1904 * Henry Yelverton (attorney-general) (1566–1629), English attorney-general * Henry Yelverton, 3rd Earl of Sussex, Earl of Sussex * Henry Yelverton, 1st Viscount Longueville, Viscount Longueville == See also == * Yelverton (disambiguation) ","title":"Henry Yelverton"},{"id":"3228328","text":"Tatyana Mikhailovna Lioznova (; 20 July 1924 – 29 September 2011) was a Soviet film director best known for her TV series Seventeen Moments of Spring (1973). ==Film career== All of Lioznova's features - from Three Poplars in Plyushcikha (1967), a cult film of the 1960s, to her last movie, Carnival (1981), - are distinguished by open narratives, psychologically penetrating close-ups, and poignant musical scores. The subtle and touching drama Three Poplars at Plyuschikha Street (1967) sprouted from Aleksandra Pakhmutova’s song “Tenderness”. The starry duet of Tatiana Doronina and Oleg Yefremov is a masterpiece of acting. This story of a nearly sprung love of a taxi driver and a married peasant woman won the hearts of Russian viewers, just like Casablanca gained the love of Americans. Known as a tireless perfectionist, filming just half a dozen features, this didn't prevent her becoming People's Artist of the USSR in 1984. She worked at the Gorky Film Studio.

He assumed the title of Earl of Desmond, which had been suppressed in 1582 after the Desmond Rebellions. He spent much of his life in captivity, and was temporarily, but unsuccessfully, restored to the earldom in 1600–01 by the English in an attempt to pacify Munster during the Nine Years War. He thus became the 1st Earl of Desmond, but soon returned to England, where he died in obscurity. ==Early life== James FitzGerald, the son of the 15th Earl and Eleanor Butler, was born during the earlier of the Desmond Rebellions; Queen Elizabeth of England was his godmother. He was resident in Ireland in 1579, when his father joined the later rebellion against the crown, and at that time his mother chose to deliver him to Sir William Drury, lord deputy of Ireland, who placed him in custody in Dublin Castle. In August 1582, his mother complained bitterly to Lord Burghley that her son's education was being neglected and sought better care for him. After the death of his fugitive father, FitzGerald's gaolers made petition to the English government for his removal to the Tower of London. The petition was granted in 1584, and before the end of the year he was removed to the Tower, where he remained for the next 16 years. ==Captivity== FitzGerald was the heir to the earldom of Desmond, but in 1585 his late father's estate was attainted by the Irish parliament and all its property confiscated by the crown. Most of the hereditary lands in the province of Munster then underwent a radical plantation by English settlers (see Plantation of Munster), but such was the loyalty attached to the FitzGerald name there that the government had good cause to fear a future rebellion. These events occurred during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604), and English fear was increased with the prospect of an intervention by the Spanish, who had an historical affinity with the west coast of Ireland. It was in this context that the young heir found himself nurtured in London, where he was to lead a miserable existence. He appears to have been sickly, as shown by the accounts kept between 1588 and 1598 of payments for medicines, ointments, pills and syrups administered to him. In 1593, he wrote in pathetic terms to the queen's secretary, Sir Robert Cecil, but the government really only had one use for him. ==Irish campaign== In 1600, during the Nine Years War (Ireland) and following hostile intrusions into Munster at the direction of Hugh O'Neill, 3rd Earl of Tyrone, it was suggested by Sir George Carew that FitzGerald be paraded through the province as the true Earl of Desmond, to counter the popularity of the pretender to the earldom, James FitzThomas FitzGerald, (known as the – i.e. Hayrope – Earl). The queen hesitated at this suggestion, but was convinced by Cecil that the risk was worth taking. A patent for the title of Earl of Desmond (the second creation) passed the great seal, without restoration of the confiscated lands and restricting any inheritance of the title; an allowance of £500 pa. was granted. FitzGerald was to remain in the custody of Captain Price and Miler Magrath, archbishop of Cashel; Price was charged with keeping him faithful to the queen and the Protestant religion, and was to maintain a frugal household. Carew was instructed by Cecil to keep FitzGerald under close observation, ready to arrest him if he showed sympathy with the rebels, while allowing the appearance of liberty. FitzGerald's party set out from Bristol in October 1600, bound for Cork, but the prisoner suffered such a severe bout of sea- sickness that he had to be landed at Youghal in south Munster. He was received enthusiastically by the Geraldine supporters – though the mayor of Cork was not courteous – and was quickly transferred to Mallow, and then to Kilmallock in the heart of Desmond country, where he was given lodgings by the English commander Sir George Thornton. On his arrival he praised the queen's clemency and was well liked; the next day – a Sunday – he ostentatiously made his way to the Protestant church, while his followers awaited him in the Catholic chapel, a disappointment for which he was instantly derided by the people. In November 1600 the fortress of Castlemaine was surrendered to FitzGerald by a servant of the Súgán Earl, but owing to his failure to command the allegiance of the people the government soon discarded the Desmond heir. ==Death== FitzGerald resented the meanness of his allowance and was forbidden by Cecil to marry the widow Norreys, since a better match in England was hoped for. In March 1601 he was brought to London with a letter from Carew recommending him for a grant of land and a settled income. In August he complained of being penniless and despised, and appealed to Cecil for some of the lands that had been held by the Súgán Earl. He died in London in early November 1601, but it was only in January 1602 that the death was announced. His guardians were then released from their charge, one of whom, William Power, wrote for pecuniary assistance for FitzGerald's four sisters. ==Ancestry== ==Sources== * Richard Bagwell, Ireland under the Tudors 3 vols.

It is bounded to the north by Rinnay river, south by Kibar Nala catchment, east by main divide of Great Himalaya and west by Marwa river. ==Date and history of establishment== It was declared a National Park on 4 February 1981 (Notification no. 21/FST of 1980-1981). *Area 400 km2 *land Tenure state *Altitude Ranges from 1,700 m to 4,800 m ==Physical features== The National Park encompasses the catchments of Kiar, Nath and Kibar Nalas, all of which drain south-west into Marwa River which joins the Chenab River just above Kishtwar Town. The terrain is generally rugged and steep, with narrow valleys bounded by high ridges opening in their upper glacial parts. The area lies in the Central Crystalline belt of the Great Himalayas. Rocks are strongly folded in places and composed mainly of granite, gneiss and schist, with the occasional bed of marble. The shallow, slightly alkaline soils are mostly alluvial with gravel deposits (Kurt,1976;Bacha, 1986). ==Climate== The influence of the monsoon is weak. Mean annual rainfall at palmar and Sirshi (1,761 m), located near the periphery of the national park, is 827 mm and 741 mm, respectively, precipitation is maximal and in excess of 100 mm per month in March and April, and again in July and August. Most snow fall in December and January when the whole area becomes snowbound. Mean maximum and minimum temperatures recorded at Sirshi are 130 and -70 in January and 350c and 110c in July respectively (Kurt, 1976;Bacha,1986). ==Vegetation== Based on revised classification of Champion and Seth (1968), some 13 vegetation types are represented (Bacha,1986). In general, silver fir 'Abies pindrow' and spruce 'Picea wallichian', mixed with cedar Cedrus deodar and blue pine Pinus griffithii are predominant from 2,400m to 3,000m. Notable is the small expanse of chilgoza pine Pinus geradiana in the Dachan Range. At lower altitudes (1,700-2,400m) occur nearly pure stands of cedar and blue pine, and moist temperate deciduous forest, represented by horsechestnut, Aesculus indica, walnut Juglans regia, maple, Acer spp. poplar, Populus ciliata, hazel Corylus cornutam bird cherry Pasus corfnuta, ash Fraxinus cornuta and yew Taxus wallichiana. The sub-alpine zone, from 3,000m to the tree line at 3,700m, supports mostly silver fir and birch Betula utilis forest and this merges with birch -rhododendron Rhododendron campanulatum scrub, above which is alpine pasture. Among the animals that make their home here include the Himalayan snowcock and the brown bear. ==Cultural heritage== Racial groups include Kashmiris, Thakurs, Gujars, Rajputs and Brahmans (Bacha, 1986) ==Local human population== There are permanent settlements but some 1,115 families of nomadic graziers, with 25,000 head of livestock, and an unspecified number of families from nearby villages, with 10,000 head, have grazing rights in the national park. Some agriculture is practised in peripheral areas.

Photographed by Julia Margaret Cameron, 1866 \\"Lady Clara Vere de Vere\\" is an English poem written by Alfred Tennyson, part of his collected Poems published in 1842. The poem is about a lady in a family of aristocrats, and includes numerous references to nobility, such as to earls or coats of arms. One such line from the poem goes, \\"Kind hearts are more than coronets, and simple faith than Norman blood.\\" This line gave the title to the film Kind Hearts and Coronets. Lewis Carroll's poem \\"Echoes\\" is based on \\"Lady Clare Vere de Vere\\". Tennyson spent some time as a guest at Curragh Chase and wrote the poem to show his close friendship with the de Vere family. Despite this, the poem is a scathing rebuke. The speaker tells that Lady Clara has rebuffed a young, but low-born man who loved her, and he committed suicide after her rejection. The references to coronets and earls are deployed ironically-- the poem's speaker is not, in fact, impressed with the Vere de Vere ancestry, and all of her noble claims can't balance out Lady Clara's coldness, pride, and idleness (as proven by the fact that she apparently has no better claim on her time than breaking hearts). The poem's speaker then professes a more democratic viewpoint, where good character is earned by virtue, not by high birth. ==References in other works== In J. M. Barrie's play What Every Woman Knows, \\"Vere de Vere\\" is referred to as a slightly-cynical metaphor for \\"the noble nobility\\": ::COMTESSE. It seems to be no joke to you, Mr. Shand. Sybil, my pet, are you to let him off? ::SYBIL [flashing]. Let him off? If he wishes it. Do you? ::JOHN [manfully]. I want it to go on.

If you come with me, Sybil, I’ll do all in a man’s power to make you never regret it. ::[Triumph of the Vere de Veres.] In C. J. Mathews' My Awful Dad (1881) the name Vere de Vere is used humorously as a stereotypical name of a member of the nobility: \\"You shall sit next to Evangeline Clara Vere de Vere, nee Tadpole, the grand double-jointed sentimental comic clog and pump dancer.\\" In the 1917 P.

It provides an asymptotic formula for counting the number of prime ideals of a number field K, with norm at most X. ==Example== What to expect can be seen already for the Gaussian integers. There for any prime number p of the form 4n + 1, p factors as a product of two Gaussian primes of norm p. Primes of the form 4n + 3 remain prime, giving a Gaussian prime of norm p2. Therefore, we should estimate :2r(X)+r^\\\\prime(\\\\sqrt{X}) where r counts primes in the arithmetic progression 4n + 1, and r′ in the arithmetic progression 4n + 3. By the quantitative form of Dirichlet's theorem on primes, each of r(Y) and r′(Y) is asymptotically :\\\\frac{Y}{2\\\\log Y}. Therefore, the 2r(X) term predominates, and is asymptotically :\\\\frac{X}{\\\\log X}. ==General number fields== This general pattern holds for number fields in general, so that the prime ideal theorem is dominated by the ideals of norm a prime number. As Edmund Landau proved in , for norm at most X the same asymptotic formula :\\\\frac{X}{\\\\log X} always holds. Heuristically this is because the logarithmic derivative of the Dedekind zeta- function of K always has a simple pole with residue −1 at s = 1. As with the Prime Number Theorem, a more precise estimate may be given in terms of the logarithmic integral function. The number of prime ideals of norm ≤ X is : \\\\mathrm{Li}(X) + O_K(X \\\\exp(-c_K \\\\sqrt{\\\\log(X)}) , \\\\, where cK is a constant depending on K. ==See also== * Abstract analytic number theory ==References== * * * Category:Theorems in analytic number theory Category:Theorems in algebraic number theory ","title":"Landau prime ideal theorem"},{"id":"3228369","text":"Khangchendzonga National Park also Kanchenjunga Biosphere Reserve is a National Park and a Biosphere reserve located in Sikkim, India.

On 30 November 1915, the 35th Regiment \\"Simcoe Foresters\\" was authorized to raise the 157th Battalion. Based in Barrie, Ontario, the 157th Battalion, Simcoe Foresters, began recruiting in late 1915 in Simcoe County. 2,450 volunteers were recruited, of which 1,070 officers and other ranks were enlisted in the battalion. Of the remainder, about 700 were rejected as being medically unfit, 75 were transferred to the 76th Battalion, and the approximately 600 remaining were transferred to the 177th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF. Under the command of Lieutenant- Colonel D.H. MacLaren, the 157th was tasked with constructing a new army training camp on the Simcoe Pines Plain, which was to be named Camp Borden. Construction began in May 1916 with the companies from Barrie and Collingwood. A second company from Barrie arrived in June to help speed up the construction. As such, the 157th became the founding battalion of Camp Borden, which it constructed to accommodate 40 infantry battalions in 10 brigades. Before the camp was opened the remainder of the 157th and the entire 177th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel J.B. McPhee, arrived. By that summer, Camp Borden was home to 36 CEF battalions in nine brigades before they embarked overseas. On the night of Camp Borden's official opening, a riot by members of other battalions was suppressed by both the 157th and 177th battalions of the Simcoe Foresters, which were turned out with bayonets fixed. On 12 October 1916, the battalion received its regimental colours at Camp Borden, which were subsequently laid up in St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Barrie, Ontario, after the war on 10 October 1919. The colours were reclaimed by The Grey and Simcoe Foresters, which perpetuates the 157th, on 18 June 1982 and deposited in the regiment's Barrie Officers' Mess. Training at Camp Borden ended on 13 October 1916, when the 157th Battalion departed for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Embarking on board the on 18 October 1916, the battalion sailed for Liverpool, England, arriving on 28 October. From Liverpool, the 157th was stationed for only a week at Witley Camp before proceeding to Bramshott Camp as part of the 7th Training Brigade. Like so many CEF Battalions arriving in England at that time, the 157th Battalion, Simcoe Foresters was broken up for reinforcements to units already in the field. Immediately a draft of 150 men was sent to the 1st, followed by a further 50 men to the 19th, on 5 December 1916. Three days later, a further 400 men were sent to join the 116th, which was in theatre in France. The balance of the 157th Battalion went to the 125th and the 8th Reserve Battalion. Before being transferred to other units, the officers were sent to Crowborough for additional instructional training. By war's end, these Foresters had fought in the following battles: Arras, 1917; Vimy Ridge, 9-14 April 1917; Arleux, 28-29 April 1917; Capture of Fresnoy, 3-4 May 1917; Affairs, South of Souchez River, 3-25 June 1917; Capture of Avion, 26-29 June 1917; Battle of Hill 70, 15-25 August 1917; Ypres, 1917; and Second Battle of Passchendaele, 26 October–10 November 1917. Today, the volunteer Borden Pipes & Drums band wear the Hunting Stewart tartan in honour of the 157th Battalion, Simcoe Foresters, founding battalion of the base. In June 2015, a contingent of civilian donors from the Borden Legacy Project and military personnel from CFB Borden travelled to Vimy Ridge to patriate soil, which will be encapsulated into a new memorial at the base marking its centennial of service. During this Vimy pilgrimage, the graves and memorials for 13 members of the 157th Simcoe Foresters who lost their lives during the Battle of Vimy Ridge were visited. During the First World War, the 157th Battalion, Simcoe Foresters suffered 133 killed-in-action or died-of-wounds. This was a huge sacrifice by the families of Simcoe County through just one of its CEF battalions. From the four CEF battalions perpetuated by The Grey and Simcoe Foresters (147th, 157th, 177th, and 248th) over 450 lost their lives during the First World War.

The ACC was created partly in response to the four countries being left out of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), partly out of a desire to foster closer economic cooperation and integration among its members, and partly as an Egyptian step to rejoin mainstream Arab politics after years of ostracism following its peace treaty with Israel. The members of the ACC, unlike the GCC states, appeared uncomfortable with the grouping's exclusion of other Arab states; the ACC charter explicitly states that \\"Membership in the ACC shall be open to every Arab state wishing to join it.\\" The short-lived organization held at least 17 formal meetings at the summit or ministerial level in 1989 alone, in addition to dozens of working-level sessions. This level of institutionalization was more extensive than most Arab subregional gatherings had exhibited. Somalia and Djibouti showed interest to join the ACC but were asked to wait until the ACC would be consolidated. However, the organization did not survive the crisis that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990. In part, this can be attributed to the four countries' lack of common geopolitical interests, the absence of a true shared identity (beyond common status as Arab states), and tensions between Egypt and Iraq. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Egypt in particular opposed Iraqi actions—actually joining the coalition that sent troops to Saudi Arabia and eventually liberated Kuwait. In retrospect, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said that the security aspects of the ACC were probably designed by Iraq to lure Cairo into backing Saddam Hussein's foray into Kuwait .

Zemu Glacier is the largest glacier in the Eastern Himalaya. It is about in length and is located at the base of Kangchenjunga in the Himalayan region of Sikkim, India. The Zemu Glacier drains the east side of Kanchenjunga, the world's third highest mountain. The glacier is the source of water for numerous rivers, as it feeds them when it melts. One of them is the Teesta River, which has garnered large attention in the past few years because of a proposed 3500 MW hydropower plant. At the moment the Government of Sikkim has only been able to run a 510 MW plant on the river. Owing to the location of the river in an earthquake prone area, the hydropower plants will be a run of the river project. Zemu Glacier remains a less studied and monitored glacier. Studying digital imagery shows that the glacier has receded 27 meters every year between 1967–1984. The retreat is not massive given the great length of the glacier. There is a thick layer of debris on the glacier, preventing ablation: there are, however, small lakes that have formed on the surface of these debris-covered sections of the glacier. ==Changes and Threats== Zemu Glacier has seen significant retreat in recent years. The lateral moraine ridges on either side of the glacier are on average 150 feet high. These ridges were created during the Little Ice Age advance. Lateral moraines never get higher than glacier surfaces that create them. This means that the underside of the glacier has thinned by 150 feet in the last century. Another problem on the glacier is the disappearance of its tributaries. Many of its tributaries no longer meet it. This deprives the glacier of a significant portion of its former ice sources. The head of the glacier is fed by debris from the Kanchenjunga slopes. The lower 18 km of the glacier is an ablation zone where melting is immense. Recent studies have shown that between 2000 and 2013 the surrounding glaciers of the Zemu have shrunk drastically, reducing the source for the main glacier and increasing the risk of its shrinkage. ==See also== * List of glaciers ==References== == External links == * Map from 1931 German expedition Category:Glaciers of Sikkim Category:Glaciers of the Himalayas ","title":"Zemu Glacier"},{"id":"3228399","text":"Bergh Apton is a village and civil parish in the South Norfolk district of Norfolk, England, 7 miles (11 km) south-east of Norwich just south of the A146 between Yelverton and Thurton. According to the 2001 census it had a population of 428 in 186 households, the population increasing to 442 at the 2011 Census. ==History== Originally, Bergh Apton was two separate villages; Apton to the north-west and Bergh to the south-east, each with its own church. Apton was served by the church of St. Martin which lay near the present day Church Farm on Dodgers Lane, its last recorded use being in 1555 and the remains being finally cleared in 1834. Bergh was served by the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul which stands on a low hill overlooking the River Chet which marks the southern boundary of the now combined parish. The church appears to have been reconstructed in the 14th century, with local flint with ashlar and brick details. ==Today== The village school was closed in 1981 and the children transferred to Alpington and Bergh Apton CofE voluntary-aided school in Alpington. The village shop and Post Office closed on 31 December 2012. In August 2015 the Post Office reopened its Bergh Apton branch within the Green Pastures Plant Centre and Farm Shop on Mill Road. The village hall, opened on the day of Queen Elizabeth's coronation on 2 June 1953 was totally refurbished in 2013 and reopened in November of that year with new facilities and all- ability access. The hall is regularly used by village societies, the Parish Council, and numerous activities that include a microscopy study group, yoga, painting, singing and dog-training. Bergh Apton is served by bus route 570 operated by Konectbus providing five services a day into Norwich and out to Seething and Loddon.Anglian Coaches Timetable Timetable ==Sculpture Trail and Mystery Plays== Beginning in 1997 and repeated in 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2011, the village hosted six sculpture trails with works from over 60 artists both local to Norfolk and from across the UK, displayed in private gardens and public places. The trails were organised by Bergh Apton Community Arts Trust and became significant South Norfolk tourist attractions. In the years 2005, 2008 and 2011, they drew over 10,000 visitors over three weekends in late May/early June. During the 2011 Sculpture Trail, the village, with assistance from the Bishop of Norwich, performed “A Mighty Water”. This Mystery Play, based on the story of Noah, was commissioned from internationally renowned story teller, Hugh Lupton. In May and June 2014, Bergh Apton was joined by inhabitants of 11 neighbouring villages to perform a Cycle of four Mystery Plays based on the Bible stories in the Legend of the Rood, also commissioned from Hugh Lupton. ==See also== *Bergh Apton Anglo-Saxon cemetery ==References== ==External links== *Bergh Apton website *2002/5 Sculpture Trail on Flickr Category:Villages in Norfolk Category:Sculpture gardens, trails and parks in the United Kingdom Category:Civil parishes in Norfolk ","title":"Bergh Apton"},{"id":"3228410","text":"The Construction of Noah's Ark by Jacopo Bassano depicts all eight people said to be on the ark, including Noah's wife and the wives of his three sons. The wives aboard Noah's Ark were part of the family that survived the Deluge in the biblical Genesis flood narrative. They are the wife of Noah, and the wives of each of his three sons. Although the Bible only notes the existence of these women, there are extra-Biblical mentions regarding them and their names. ==Torah== In Genesis 6:18, God says to Noah, \\"But I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you\\" (ESV). ==Book of Tobit== The deuterocanonical Book of Tobit (written c. 225–175 BC) does not name any of the wives aboard Noah's Ark, but it does say that Noah's wife was one of his \\"own kindred\\" (Tobit 4:12). ==Book of Jubilees== In the Book of Jubilees (160–150 BC) the names of the wives of Noah, Shem, Ham and Japheth are as follows: *Wife of Noah – Emzara *Wife of Shem – Sedeqetelebab *Wife of Ham – Na'eltama'uk *Wife of Japheth – 'Adataneses It adds that the three sons each built a city named after their wives. ==New Testament== 1 Peter 3:20 (written in the late 1st century AD) states that there were eight people on the Ark. ==Sibylline oracles== According to the Sibylline Oracles, the wives of Shem, Ham and Japheth enjoyed fantastically long lifespans, living for centuries, while speaking prophecy to each generation they saw come and go.These were considered to be the Sibylline Books of the Greeks and Romans by Athenagoras of Athens, quoting them in a letter to the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius in 176 AD, but modern critics believe they are rather pseudo-Oracles dating from the middle of the 2nd century BC at the earliest to the 5th century AD, composed by Alexandrian Jews and revised and enriched by later Christian editors, all adding texts in the interests of their respective religions. According to the preface of the Oracles, the Sibyl author was a daughter-in- law of Noah: the \\"Babylonian Sibyl\\", Sambethe -- who, 900 years after the Deluge, allegedly moved to Greece and began writing the Oracles. The writings attributed to her (at the end of Book III) also hint at possible names of her family who would have lived before the Flood -- father Gnostos, mother Circe; elsewhere (in book V) she calls Isis her sister. Other early sources similarly name one of the Sibyls as Sabba (see Sibyl in Jewish Encyclopedia). ==Christian writers== The early Christian writer St. Hippolytus (d. 235 AD) recounted a tradition of their names according to the Syriac Targum that is similar to Jubilees, although apparently switching the names of Shem's and Ham's wives. He wrote: \\"The names of the wives of the sons of Noah are these: the name of the wife of Sem, Nahalath Mahnuk; and the name of the wife of Cham, Zedkat Nabu; and the name of the wife of Japheth, Arathka\\". He also recounts a quaint legend concerning the wife of Ham: God having instructed Noah to destroy the first person who announced that the deluge was beginning, Ham's wife at that moment was baking bread, when water suddenly rushed forth from the oven, destroying the bread. When she exclaimed then that the deluge was commencing, God suddenly cancels his former command lest Noah destroy his own daughter-in-law who was to be saved.A strange book of poetry published in 1889 by American Charles Phifer called Annals of the Earth p. 286, in its voluminous appendix of mythographic notes, has the following statement, albeit without clear attributation: \\"Persian Magi hold that the first waters of the flood gushed out of the oven of an old woman named Zola Cufa.\\" Water gushing forth from an oven (tannur) at the commencement of the Deluge, as mentioned in the Quran (11:40), is also held to be the signal for Noah in the 14th-century Stories of the Prophets by Ibn Kathir. An early Arabic work known as Kitab al- Magall or the Book of Rolls (part of Clementine literature), the Syriac Book of the Cave of Treasures (c. 350), and Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria (c. 930) all agree in naming Noah's wife as \\"Haykêl, the daughter of Namûs (or Namousa), the daughter of Enoch, the brother of Methuselah\\"; the first of these sources elsewhere calls Haikal \\"the daughter of Mashamos, son of Enoch\\", while stating that Shem's wife is called \\"Leah, daughter of Nasih\\". Furthermore, the Panarion of Epiphanius (c. 375) names Noah's wife as Barthenos, while the c. 5th-century Ge'ez work Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan calls Noah's wife \\"Haikal, the daughter of Abaraz, of the daughters of the sons of Enos\\" -- whom some authors have connected with Epiphanius' Barthenos (i.e., Bath-Enos, daughter of Enos). However, Jubilees makes \\"Betenos\\" the name of Noah's mother. The word haykal is Syriac for \\"temple\\" or \\"church\\"; in the Georgian copy of Cave of Treasures, we find instead the name T'ajar, which is the Georgian word for the same. Armenian tradition give the name of Noah's wife as Nemzar, Noyemzar or Noyanzar. Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria, writing in Arabic, also states that Shem's wife was Salit, Ham's Nahlat and Japheth's Arisisah, all daughters of Methuselah. The theologian John Gill (1697–1771) wrote in his Exposition of the Bible of this tradition \\"that the name of Shem's wife was Zalbeth, or, as other copies, Zalith or Salit; that the name of Ham's Nahalath; and of Japheth's Aresisia.\\" A manuscript of the 8th-century Latin work Inventiones Nominum, copies of which have been found at the Abbey of St. Gall in Switzerland, and in a library at Albi, SW France, lists as Noah's wife Set, as Shem's wife Nora, as Ham's wife Sare, and as Japeth's wife Serac. ==Jewish Rabbinic literature== The Genesis Rabba midrash lists Naamah, the daughter of Lamech and sister of Tubal-Cain, as the wife of Noah, Midrash rabbah translated into English with glossary and indices under the editorship of H. Freedman and Maurice Simon p.194 as does the 11th-century Jewish commentator Rashi in his commentary on Genesis 4:22. In the medieval midrash , the name of Noah's wife is said to be Naamah, daughter of Enoch. ==Islamic traditions== The Persian historian Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (c. 915) recounts that Japheth's wife was Arbasisah, daughter of Marazil, son of al-Darmasil, son of Mehujael, son of Enoch, son of Cain; that Ham's wife was Naḥlab, daughter of Marib, another son of al-Darmasil; and that Shem's wife was Ṣalib, daughter of Batawil, another son of Mehujael. He says Noah's wife was Amzurah, daughter of Barakil, another son of Mehujael. (According to George Sale's Commentary on the Quran (1734), some Muslim commentators asserted that Noah had had an infidel wife named Waila, who perished in the deluge, and was thus not aboard the Ark.) ==Irish and Anglo- Saxon traditions== Irish folklore is rich in traditions and legends regarding the three sons and their wives. Here the wives are usually named Olla, Olliva, and Ollivani (or variations thereof), names possibly derived from the Anglo- Saxon Codex Junius (c. 700 AD), a Bible paraphrase written in the fashion of Germanic sagas, and often attributed to the poet Cædmon. The wife of Noah is given as Percoba in Codex Junius. The Anglo-Saxon \\"Solomon and Saturn\\" dialogue gives for Noah's wife Dalila, for Ham's, Jaitarecta, and for Japheth's Catafluvia, while giving Olla, Ollina and Ollibana as alternatives. The name of Shem's wife is missing. Some versions of the Gaelic Lebor Gabala also name Shem's, Ham's and Japheth's wives as Cata Rechta, Cata Flauia and Cata Chasta respectively. Similar traditions seem to have endured for several centuries in some form, for in Petrus Comestor, we read that the wives of Noah, Shem, Ham and Japheth are Phuarpara, Pharphia, Cataflua and Fliva respectively, and in a 15th-century Middle English catechism, we find written \\"What hicht Noes wyf?\\" \\"Dalida; and the wif of Sem, Cateslinna; and the wif of Cam, Laterecta; and the wif of Japheth, Aurca. And other 3 names, Ollia, Olina, and Olybana.\\" Ælfric of Eynsham's Anglo-Saxon translation of the Heptateuch (c. 1000) included illustrations with the wives' names recorded in the captions. One such illustration (fol. 17) names Noah's wife as Phiapphara, Shem's as Parsia, Ham's as Cataphua, and Japheth's as Fura. Another (fol. 14) includes one wife, presumably Noah's, named Sphiarphara. A Middle English illustrated version of Genesis dating to the 13th century also gives Puarphara as Noah's wife. ==Mandaeism== Mandaean literature, of uncertain antiquity, refers to Noah's wife by the name Nuraita (or Nhuraitha, Anhuraita, various other spellings). ==Gnostic literature== Gnostic literature of the first few centuries AD calls Noah's wife Norea, including texts ascribed to her, as reported by Epiphanius, and confirmed in modern times with the discovery of these texts at Nag Hammadi. ==Képes Krónika== Hungarian folklore has several tales about Japheth and his wife called Eneh, attributing this information to the Chronicles of Sigilbert, Bishop of Antioch in the 14th-century Képes Krónika. ==Pseudo-Berossus== According to the 15th-century monk Annio da Viterbo, the Hellenistic Babylonian writer Berossus had stated that the sons' wives were Pandora, Noela, and Noegla, and that Noah's wife was Tytea. However, Annio's manuscript is widely regarded today as having been a forgery. Nonetheless, later writers made use of this \\"information\\", sometimes even combining it with other traditions. The Portuguese friar Gaspar Rodriguez de S. Bernardino wrote in Itinerario da India por terra ate a ilha de Chypre in 1842 that the wives of Noah, Shem, Ham and Japheth were named Tytea or Phuarphara, Pandora or Parphia, Noela or Cataflua, and Noegla, Eliua or Arca. In Robert Southey's Common-place Book from around the same time, similar names are given, with the information attributed to the \\"Comte de Mora Toledo\\": Titea Magna; Pandora; Noala or Cataflua; and Noegla, Funda or Afia, respectively. ==Comte de Gabalis== A kabalistic work that appeared in 1670, known as Comte de Gabalis, considered sacred in Rosicrucianism, maintains that the name of Noah's wife was Vesta. This name for Noah's wife had earlier been found in Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa's History of the Incas (c. 1550), where the names Prusia or Persia, Cataflua and Funda are also given for Shem, Ham, and Japheth's wives respectively. ==See also== *Hebrew Sibyl *List of names for the biblical nameless *Seven Laws of Noah *Women in the Bible ==References== Category:Book of Genesis people Category:Noah's Ark Category:Bible-related lists of people Category:Lists of wives Category:Noach (parsha) Category:Women in the Hebrew Bible Category:Unnamed people of the Bible ","title":"Wives aboard Noah's Ark"},{"id":"3228413","text":"Daggerspell (1986) is a fantasy novel by American writer Katharine Kerr. Her first novel, it is also the first book in the Celtic themed, multi- reincarnational Deverry cycle. ==Plot summary== Events are listed here not in chronological order, but in the order they were originally presented in the novel. ; Year 1045 The sorcerer Nevyn sees an omen indicating that a person whose destiny is intertwined with his own has been reborn, and sees the infant Jill in a vision. ; Year 1052 Jill, a seven-year-old girl who sometime has precognitive dreams, loses her mother Seryan to a fever. Because her father, Cullyn, is a mercenary soldier – known as a \\"silver dagger\\" for the weapon he carries – and visits irregularly, Jill is taken in by a local tavern owner. Cullyn arrives in Jill's village a month later. Finding Seryan dead, he decides to take Jill with him on his wanderings, which he calls \\"the long road.” For seven years, Nevyn has been searching for Jill, with nothing more than luck and intuition to guide him. He finds a clue when he meets the ten- year-old lord Rhodry Maelwaedd, and sees that the boy's destiny is linked with his and Jill's. ; Year 643 Galrion, a prince of Deverry, has secretly begun studying sorcery. He begins to fall in love with its power, and out of love with his betrothed, Brangwen of the Falcon clan. Galrion considers breaking his betrothal so that he will have more time to devote to the study of sorcery. Galrion's father, King Adyroc, is infuriated when he discovers that his son has been studying sorcery, and puts Galrion under house arrest, though the prince escapes by a ruse. Adyroc soon finds his son and sends him into exile, taking from him all his rank, titles, and property. He even takes Galrion's name from him, and gives him a new name, Nevyn, meaning \\"no one.\\" Adyroc also breaks Nevyn's betrothal to Brangwen, who then falls into an incestuous relationship with her brother Gerraent, and the two promise to end their lives together when autumn comes. When Gerraent's sworn friend, Blaen of the Boar clan, discovers the incestuous relationship, Gerraent kills him. Gerraent is in turn killed by Blaen's brother. Nevyn takes Brangwen away from the Falcon lands, but the distraught girl drowns herself. Overwhelmed by guilt and grief, Nevyn rashly swears an oath that he will not rest until he sets things right. Thunder booms from a clear sky – a sign that his oath has been accepted by the Great Ones (transcendent spiritual beings similar to Bodhisattvas). ; Year 1058 When Jill turns thirteen, Cullyn, who has been teaching his daughter swordcraft, buys Jill a silver dagger like his own for a birthday present. Otho, the smith who made the dagger, notices that Jill can see spirits called Wildfolk, and tells her a riddle. \\"If you ever find no one (nev yn), ask him what craft to take.\\" Some time later, Otho tells Nevyn about Jill. Unable to find her, Nevyn returns to his home province of Eldidd, where he saves the life of Rhodry Maelwaedd, earning the gratitude of his mother Lovyan, the local feudal lord. Nevyn receives a prophecy about the boy – Rhodry's destiny is somehow bound to that of the entire province. ; Year 696 Nevyn comes to Deverry province to banish an unnatural drought. Here he finds the bard Gweran (Blaen reborn), his wife Lyssa (Brangwen reborn), and a soldier called Tanyc (Gerraent reborn). When Tanyc angers Gweran by his behavior towards Lyssa, Gweran takes his revenge by subterfuge. He provokes Tanyc into attacking him – but as a bard, Gweran's life is sacrosanct. Tanyc is hanged for his crime. While this is happening, Nevyn meets Lyssa's elder son, Aderyn. He teaches the boy a little herbcraft, and eventually takes him as apprentice in sorcery. ;Year 1062 Lovyan discovers that Rhodry has fathered a bastard child on a low-born girl, and decides to put the child into fosterage with one of her noble servitors when it is born. In the meantime, Lovyan is having trouble with some of her vassals. A number of minor lords are sitting on the edge of rebellion over matters of succession and taxes. Lovyan's own liege lord, Rhys, the Gwerbret of Aberwyn (who is also her eldest son), makes it very clear that he won't intervene unless she disinherits Rhodry. Cullyn, meanwhile has taken a hire guarding a caravan heading toward the kingdom's western border to trade with the mysterious Westfolk. On the way, Jill sees the eerie Loddlaen, a councilor to Lord Corbyn of Bruddlyn. At the trading camp, Jill meets Aderyn, an old Deverrian man who lives with the Westfolk. She also learns that Loddlaen is a fugitive murderer. At the conclusion of the trading, Aderyn and several of the Westfolk accompany the caravan back to the city of Cannobaen, to begin legal proceedings against Loddlaen in Lovyan's court. On the way to Cannobaen, the caravan is attacked by bandits, and flees to an abandoned fort to make their stand. Aderyn transforms himself into an owl to spy on the bandits. He discovers that they aren't bandits at all, but warriors from several different lords, including Corbyn. Cullyn sends Jill to beg the Lovyan for aid. By a stroke of luck, Jill comes across Rhodry and his entire warband on the road, in the midst of a day- long training exercise. Meanwhile, the attacking army has reached the fort. The defense is thin: two swordsmen, two archers, and six stavemen. Albaral, a man of the Westfolk, is slain, but the attackers are defeated when Rhodry and his warband arrive. ==Publication history== Daggerspell was first published in hardcover by Del Rey in 1986.

The Roman road between Dorchester-on-Thames and Alchester runs through the centre of Berinsfield. An Anglo-Saxon cemetery was also found at Berinsfield. The village is on the site of RAF Mount Farm, a satellite of RAF Benson, initially used to train bomber pilots. It was later taken over by the United States Army Air Forces, who used it as a reconnaissance base. From here stars including Bob Hope, Dorothy Lamour and Glenn Miller took off to entertain the troops in Europe. Miller performed for the US service personnel at the base in December 1944 before his fateful flight from RAF Twinwood Farm which disappeared en route to Paris. After World War II the disused airbase was occupied by squatters, some of whom stayed for over a decade until, in 1957, the Air Ministry sold the airfield for civilian use. Bullingdon Rural District Council decided to build a new council estate to be named after Birinus or Berin, a local saint. The word 'field' was added because the Americans called their base an airfield. Many new residents at that time lived in the former Royal Air Force huts until brick-built houses were constructed on the site. part of Fane Drive, the main road within the village Berinsfield is the first English village to be built on virgin land for more than 200 years.

They are known for mixing pop hooks and structures with elements of noise rock and experimental music and also for their exciting live performances, where Kody and Ruban Nielson have been known to climb P.A. stacks, hang from lighting rigs, destroy guitars, engage in self-harm and even attack the stage with a chainsaw. ==History== Meeting in high school, the band formed in 2001, and began by playing punk house parties and low profile shows before being discovered by acclaimed New Zealand independent record label Flying Nun Records. They released two EPs and three albums under the Flying Nun Records banner: Octagon, Octagon, Octagon EP (2003), Anti-Tiger EP (2004), Fuck the Golden Youth (2005), Crazy? Yes! Dumb? No! (2006) and Screens (2009), as well as one EP on a minor label, Bad Buzz (2010). All were produced and recorded by the band's core members Ruban and Kody Nielson, with the exception of Crazy? Yes! Dumb? No! which was produced by the Nielson brothers and their father Chris Nielson at two different home studios. All four original band members met at Orewa College in Orewa, New Zealand, although the band starting moving between Portland, Oregon and Auckland, as the Nielson brothers have dual citizenship in New Zealand and the U.S. In 2006, the band played support for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. The volume of the show was reportedly so loud that part of the St James theater complex fell down, injuring two concert goers. They have also played support slots for The White Stripes, Death From Above 1979, TV on the Radio, The Blood Brothers, The Black Lips, and The Bronx. They were also part of the New Zealand line-up for Big Day Out 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2009. In 2005, it was notable that Kody Nielson wielded a chainsaw on stage and destroyed a corporate sponsor's overly prominent sign with it. At the 2007 New Zealand Music Awards the band won five Tui awards including best rock group, best album, best rock album as well as winning best album cover and best music video for the single \\"Crazy? Yes! Dumb? No!\\". On 24 October 2007, it was announced on the band's website that their bassist Michael Logie would leave the band when they relocated to Portland. The group continued as a trio, with Logie relocating to London, England. The band played a free show in Portland on 29 June 2008, in which they played their then-upcoming third album from beginning to end live. The band later supported Shihad on the July 2008 Beautiful Machine Tour and tested their new songs in front of a home audience. As a result of their bass player having left the band, the Mint Chicks weren't able to play hits from earlier songs, angering some fans. To counter this Shihad's bass player, Karl Kippenberger, filled in for several more popular songs. On 25 December 2008, The Mint Chicks released the Mintunes EP consisting of \\"8-bit versions\\" of both previously released songs and tracks from the upcoming album. The band also released an iTunes-only single during 2008, \\"Life Will Get Better Some Day\\", a teaser for the album \\"Screens\\", which was released in New Zealand on 16 March 2009 after having been recorded sporadically over the preceding two years. In October 2009 the Mint Chicks performed a rendition of Ray Columbus and the Invaders' classic hit She's a Mod at the New Zealand Music awards as a four-piece band, later released as a standalone single. Shortly afterwards on 16 October 2009, it was announced Michael Logie would be rejoining the band in a post on the band's Twitter. The band joined with New Zealand music website MusicHy.pe to promote their next record, the Bad Buzz EP, released in February 2010. Shortly after the release of the EP, the band played their final show on 12 March 2010. The show, originally a fundraiser for MusicHy.pe, ended in chaos after Kody Nielson destroyed the two drumkits and equipment, imploring the crowd to \\"start your own fucking band\\". ==Post-breakup activity== Singer Kody Nielson is making music under the alias Opossom with former bassist Michael Logie and Bic Runga and also as a solo artist under the name Silicon.

In 2014 the festival arranged for a comedy gig to be held on a Virgin Trains West Coast train service between London and Glasgow. Eight comedians including Patrick Monahan performed aboard a 'comedy carriage' of an afternoon service. In the same year a number of comedians used the background of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum as the focus of their material. Comedy performances linked to charity fundraising have also been a common occurrence during the years of the festival. Most notably Kevin Bridges headlined an event to raise funds for MND Scotland in memory of campaigner Gordon Aikman raising £25,000.

Often the only full-sized character in the segments, she acted as something of a level-headed older sister to the puppets and audience alike,Betty Aberlin comments on Jonathan Coulton's song, \\"Lady Aberlin's Muumuu\\" and explains that Fred Rogers conceptualized her as a \\"big sister\\" and an audience surrogate, providing exposition for the story's narrative. She could occasionally be seen dancing around the Neighborhood whenever she was by herself. Sometimes nicknamed \\"Lady A,\\" she also sometimes acted as a surrogate mother to Daniel Tiger. She also appeared on The Smothers Brothers Show (1975) and various TV spots. For a short time she did a late- night radio show on WYEP-FM in Pittsburgh, a station she helped found. The program featured jazz, comedy, and some spoken arts and poetry. WYEP is a non- commercial, community-supported station for progressive music, arts, and public affairs. Aberlin wrote and performed a sequence for ACRE TV's The 90's—\\"Stop Me Before I Love Again\\"—in a theme show on growing older, which aired on PBS. Aberlin played back-up singer Cheryl and later starred as Heather in the 1978 Joseph Papp production of Cryer & Ford's I'm Getting My Act Together and Taking it on the Road at the New York Shakespeare Festival's Public Theater in New York and on the road. In 1980–1981, Aberlin played Meryl Streep's sister in Elizabeth Swados' Alice in Concert, based on Alice in Wonderland, both at The Public Theater and in a 1982 television version, Alice at the Palace. Later in her career, Aberlin formed a kinship with Kevin Smith and appeared in a number of his films, including Dogma (1999), Jersey Girl (2004), Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008), and Red State (2011). ===Writings=== As a contribution to the literary web site \\"Fresh Yarn\\", Aberlin's essay The Blonding of America was published in 2005. In the essay, she comments on privilege and physical appearance. The point of departure for her reflection is the purchase of a blonde wig to hide her first gray hairs. Wearing the wig, Aberlin is aware of how it erases racial or ethnic features and how her new look evokes a more glamorous feminine stereotype. She observes how this change to her appearance effects a change of consciousness: \\"I put [the wig] on, and I don't even notice the homeless anymore.\\" She concludes the essay: \\"Later on that evening, I saw a yellow school bus, filled with Chasidim. On the sooty back window of the bus, someone had drawn a swastika. I'll tell you...it certainly feels a little safer....being blonde.\\" In 2008, Aberlin published a collection of poems, The White Page Poems, as a companion to A Book of Strife, in the Form of the Diary of an Old Soul, an 1880 collection of poems by George MacDonald. The original edition of MacDonald's book had a blank page opposite each poem. ==In popular culture== Musician Jonathan Coulton wrote the song \\"Lady Aberlin's Muumuu\\" about Aberlin's Mister Rogers character. ==References* * Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American actresses Category:20th-century American poets Category:Actresses from New York City Category:American film actresses Category:American television actresses Category:American women poets Category:Bennington College alumni Category:Jewish American actresses Category:Jewish American poets Category:20th-century American women writers ","title":"Betty Aberlin"},{"id":"3228487","text":"Pengam is a former coal village and community in the Rhymney Valley, Caerphilly county borough, in Wales. It is also a community, containing itself and the nearby village of Fleur de Lys, and at the 2001 census it has a population of 3,842, rising slightly to 3,848 at the 2011 Census. ==Location and population== Most of the village is on the east bank of the Rhymney River, in the historic county of Monmouthshire, but those parts of the village on the west bank are known as Glan-y-Nant and are in the historic county of Glamorganshire. At the 2001 census, 3,842 people lived in Pengam, and there were about 1,561 homes. 1% of residents were from ethnic minority groups, 27.67% of people were between the ages of 20 and 39, and there were 797 people over the age of 60. 67.78% of residents owned their own homes either owned outright or with a mortgage. 24.79% of residents lived in council or housing association homes. 5.89% of residents lived in privately rented homes. 1.54% of residents lived completely rent-free. The population rose slightly to 3,848 at the 2011 Census. The population density of Pengam is approximately 4,204 people per square mile (1623/km²). The actual size of the electoral ward is 0.9 square miles (2.3 km²). The biggest employer in this area (with 29.42% of people) is the manufacturing industry. Pengam is home to Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni, Pengam Primary School, Fleur-de-Lys Primary and Ysgol Trelyn. ==Coal and the railways== Two collieries previously existed in, or near, Pengam. One at the top of the Main Street (Pengam Pit), and the other was on the Aberbargoed Road (Britannia Pit). The sinking of Pengam Colliery was begun in the late 1890s by the Rhymney Iron Co. Ltd. to work the Brithdir House coal seam at a depth of 312 yards. By 1908, it was employing 196 men and in 1918 the workforce numbered 518. During the late 1920s, it came under the ownership of the Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd., who employed 67 men there in 1938. The workforce numbered 195 in 1945. As with most House Coal collieries in this area, Pengam was troubled with water inundation and heavy water pumps worked around the clock to avoid the mineworkings flooding. Production ceased in 1956 but it was kept open as an underground pumping station, to prevent the flooding of the nearby Britannia colliery. There was a landing, about halfway down in each of the Britannia shafts (North and South) from which it was possible to access Pengam pit bottom. The official entrance to Pengam colliery was adjacent to Pengam (Mon) station, on High Street previously known as Waunborfa Road. Pengam at one time had two railway stations – one in Glamorgan and one in Monmouthshire. The line in Pengam (Mon) belonged to the Brecon and Merthyr Railway. Construction began in 1825 and it was opened in 1836, mainly to cater to the needs of the small pits and levels, and then increasingly for the collieries when they were sunk at the start of the century. It also accommodated the desire for more mobility by the rapidly growing population of the valley, when the steam locomotives pulled the passenger carriages up and down the line. The railway track from Newport to Brecon, or Tredegar, branched at Machen, the line going from there to Caerphilly and Merthyr Tydfil. The line branched behind Britannia Colliery for Brecon, or carried straight on to Tredegar where the line terminated. Light engine in 1965 at the station on the Brecon and Merthyr line The locomotives hauling the coal trains along this line were pannier-tank type steam engines. The station, and stationmaster’s house were directly adjacent to Pengam pit. This closed in 1962. The other in Glamorgan was opened in 1858 by the Rhymney Railway and remains open as Pengam railway station. Pengam was the location of the Austin Junior Car Factory set up by Leonard Lord, managing Director of the Austin Motor Company, to employ disabled Welsh miners making children’s pedal cars. More than 30,000 J40 pedal cars were built between 1949 and 1962. Apart from a few managers and trainers from Longbridge, the factory was considered unique in the world at the time for having a workforce that was 100% disabled – 60% of whom suffered from Complicated Pneumoconiosis. ==External links== * Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni * Lewis School Pengam * www.geograph.co.uk : photos of Pengam and surrounding area * Welsh Coal Mines - all the pits, all the histories ==Notes== Category:Villages in Caerphilly County Borough ","title":"Pengam"},{"id":"3228488","text":"The 161st (Huron) Battalion, CEF was a unit in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War.

It is set in the aptly named \\"pixel universe\\", inhabited by pixels, voxels, vectors, plasmas (a satire on the plasma screens used by Apple computers), and polygons. The comic is known for its very literal sense of humor, and its constant breaks of the fourth wall. The text of the comic is written entirely in upper case with very little punctuation other than the occasional hyphen or exclamation point. Each comic comes with a short note, usually split into three lines at seemingly arbitrary points. These are also written in capitals with no punctuation, and usually explain or expand upon the strip. Material from Pixel is included in Attitude 3: The New Subversive Online Cartoonists. ==Development== Chris Dlugosz initially started Pixel in 2002 as a response to sprite comics, which were proliferating at the time. In an interview in 2006, Dlugosz stated that he began posting Pixel as a \\"casual gag\\" to make fun of the sprite comic genre, and that the logistics of his Pixel universe expanded over time. Dlugosz was primarily inspired by Calvin and Hobbes, which he described as \\"the sole reason [he] was not afraid to occasionally get rhetorical or philosophical in some of [his] own strips.\\" Dlugosz was introduced to the webcomic format by Penny Arcade, which he also listed as an influence. His visual style, however, is entirely different, as the world of Pixel is populated with anthropomorphic geometric shapes. When creating a Pixel strip, Dlugosz always starts with the script, as he finds that text has \\"the annoying tendency to cover up much of your art.\\" Meanwhile, he describes \\"interesting visual effects\\" as a \\"side hobby\\" of his. Dlugosz has a text file on his computer in which he keeps a list of ideas for new strips, though he noted that jokes that hit him spontaneously often make for better strips than those he thought about for longer periods of time. Dlugosz uses a template file, consisting of a blue block and a red block (pixels) standing in front of a green horizon and blue sky. He then uses a random number generator in order to produce two web colors with which to color in the two pixels, before entering the text and other effects. == Cast == === Pixels === Pixels are the main focus of the strip. They're square, genderless and monochromatic. Every pixel is of a different 24-bit colour, and there is a pixel of every colour, so there are exactly 16,777,216 of them at any given time. A pixel's first name is his colour value in hexadecimal (e.g. 0000FF), and his second name is this same value in binary (e.g.. 000000000000000011111111). Although pixels can die, they are instantly reborn as infants, usually to a parent of a similar colour. There is no pregnancy, and any pixel can give birth at any moment. Birth is painless, and merely involves an infant appearing near his parent. Infants are smaller than adult pixels, with rounded corners which quickly sharpen. Pixels do not have limbs or faces, but they can manipulate objects by mild telekinesis. Some of them wear clothes, but usually this is limited to a tie, collar and shirt pocket (without a shirt). Although there are only 224 of them, pixels can create composite images by screencapping themselves (that is, creating non-living temporary duplicates). In one minor story arc, some pixels managed to achieve transparency (became 32-bit). As of strip No. 265, this ability still exists. === Voxels === A voxel is the three-dimensional equivalent of a pixel, being cubic and able to move in the Z-axis. Their births differ from those of the pixels in that the child grows inside the parent until they are of equal size, at which point the parent dies and another voxel becomes pregnant with the recently deceased. === Polygons === Polygons are uniformly triangular, and although they are two-dimensional, they have the ability to rotate in three dimensions. They are constantly taking part in jousting matches, in which two polygons attempt to bisect each other. This is also their means of procreation, as the two parts of the loser each become an infant polygon. Unlike the other races, they are silent. Their means of communication is via \\"saying\\" images to one another. Unlike the images \\"said\\" by voxels, their word-images are well-drawn and well-defined. === Vectors === Vectors in the pixel universe aren't vectors per se; they are quadrilaterals described by vectors. Like pixels, they are limited to two dimensions. In the comic, vectors are displayed with control boxes and a central anchor point similar to those used in graphics editors such as Photoshop. Each one is capable of changing these vectors at whim, allowing them to shape-shift and fly. They are belligerent and not very bright. Vectors do not have a known means of procreation, aside from Vectorball, which appears similar to basketball. They have also been noted to have the ability to shrink to microscopic size. It is not known what consequences this development will bring. === Plasmas === Plasmas are similar to pixels in size, shape, and reproductivity, although their corners are rounded like those of an infant. Actual infants are spherical. They use blank DVDs for many things, including coffee mugs. They represent the Mac user from the perspective of the PC user. ==History== Pixel went on hiatus in 2007 from May 13 until November 9, when he altered the design and layout of the website itself. A second hiatus began in February 2008, with one last strip having been posted in September 2012. ==References== == External links == *Pixel – Webcomic (All Comics Archive) *Pixel Forum Category:Minimalism Category:2002 webcomic debuts Category:2000s webcomics Category:Pixel art webcomics Category:Webcomics in print ","title":"Pixel (webcomic)"},{"id":"3228503","text":"The Celtic Connections festival started in 1994 in Glasgow, Scotland, and has since been held every January. Featuring over 300 concerts, ceilidhs, talks, free events, late night sessions and workshops, the festival focuses on the roots of traditional Scottish music and also features international folk, roots and world music artists. The festival is produced and promoted by Glasgow Life. Donald Shaw, a founding member of Capercaillie, was appointed Celtic Connections Artistic Director in 2006. At the core of the festival is the Education Programme, which sees thousands of school children attend free morning concerts experiencing live music ranging from Burns to spiritual and blues. Celtic Connections also continues to foster new and young talent through its Young Tradition and New Voices series of concerts, and through the Danny Kyle Open Stage competition. Every night of the festival, once the concerts are over, the late-night Celtic Connections Festival Club runs through to the small hours of the morning. No programme is announced in advance, and the club is renowned for one-off collaborations between musicians appearing at the festival. Celtic Music Radio broadcasts in the Glasgow area on 95 Mhz DAB+ and on http://www.celticmusicradio.net, and is based in the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall during the festival. Celtic Music Radio broadcasts around seven hours of live material from the venue every day. This includes interviews with performers, reviews and previews of gigs, and live coverage of concerts, including every act on the Danny Kyle Open Stage. ==History== The Celtic Connections festival was founded by Colin Hynd in 1994 to fill a scheduling gap in the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall's normally quiet post- Christmas period. The first festival took place in just one venue attracting around 32,000 people to attend. In February 2004, Celtic Connections was presented with The Good Tradition Award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in recognition of its exceptional contribution to traditional music and culture. The festival also recently picked up a Nordoff Robbins Tartan Clef Award. In its 13th year (2006), over 100,000 people filled 10 venues seeing hundreds of artists brought to Glasgow from every part of the globe. In 2008, Celtic Connections celebrated its 15th birthday, with festival attendances reaching 120,000 and events taking place across 14 venues throughout Glasgow over 19 days. Celtic Connections brings in visitors from throughout the world and is an integral and vibrant part of cultural life in Glasgow, with the economic impact on the city reaching £5.8 million in 2007. The festival actively promotes artistic links and cultural exchange across countries, reinforced by Showcase Scotland which brought 200 music industry delegates from 35 different countries to Scotland looking to book Scottish bands for festivals abroad in 2008. The 2008 festival opened with the Common Ground concert where many of the artists taking part in the event performed together. Donald Shaw, artistic director of the festival, spoke about the future of Celtic Connections as well as the 1,000+ acts and 300+ events taking place in 2008 exclusively online. Celtic Connections 2009 ran from Thursday 15 January to Sunday 1 February, and featured performances from students on the BA Scottish Music course at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. ==Artists== Artists who have appeared at the festival in the past include Bob Delyn a'r Ebillion, Waiora, Julie Fowlis, Joan Baez, Bob Geldof, Clannad, Capercaillie, Luar na Lubre, Kate Rusby, Sinéad O'Connor, Alison Krauss, Shane MacGowan, Runrig, Eddi Reader, Evelyn Glennie, Carlos Núñez, James Grant, Dougie MacLean, Billy Bragg, Blazin' Fiddles, Beth Nielsen Chapman, Mariza, Seth Lakeman, The Clan Gregor Society Pipe Band, k.d. lang, Steve Earle, Idlewild, Teenage Fanclub, Snow Patrol, Bert Jansch and Bernard Butler, Eilidh Steel and Mark Neal, Malinky, Fran Healy, Alan Stivell, Alison Brown, Anna Coogan and many more.

He was named People's Artist of the USSR in 1976. ==Life and career== Yakovlev joined the Vakhtangov Theatre in 1952 but his first flirtation with fame came in 1958, when he played Prince Myshkin in Ivan Pyryev's adaptation of The Idiot. Yakovlev followed his first success with regular appearances in Eldar Ryazanov's comedies, most notably Hussar Ballad (1962), in which he played Poruchik Rzhevsky. The feature was such a resounding success that Rzhevsky's character gave rise to innumerable Russian jokes. In the 1960s and 1970s Yakovlev's career was varied and interesting, his roles ranging from Stiva Oblonsky in the classic Soviet adaptation of Anna Karenina (1968) to the paranoically jealous Ippolit in another of Ryazanov's comedies, The Irony of Fate (1975). His participation in a series of films about World War II won him the USSR State Prize for 1979.Биография Юрия Яковлева Yakovlev enjoyed perhaps his greatest popular acclaim in Leonid Gaidai's film version of Mikhail Bulgakov's egregiously funny Ivan Vasilievich Changes His Occupation (also known as Ivan Vasilievich: Back to the Future) (1973). His film career effectively came to a halt after Georgiy Daneliya's sci-fi extravaganza Kin- dza-dza!, in which he appeared alongside Yevgeny Leonov. He performed on the stage of the Vakhtangov Theatre. The actor has also played over seventy roles onstage, including mysterious Casanova (Three Ages of Casanova), brilliant court diplomat Duke Bolingbroke (Glass of Water), and tragically genius Prokofiev (Lessons of Master). == Selected filmography == * 1954 — The Great Warrior Skanderbeg () as Warrior * 1956 — Early Joys (Первые радости) as Vasily Dibich, lieutenant * 1957 — No Ordinary Summer (Необыкновенное лето) as Vasily Dibich, lieutenant * 1958 — Wind (Ветер) as Leonid Zakrewsky, lieutenant * 1958 — The Idiot (Идиот) as Prince Myshkin * 1959 — Ballad of a Soldier (Баллада о солдате) as narrator (voice) * 1961 — Nowhere Man (Человек ниоткуда) as Vladimir Porazhaev * 1962 — Hussar Ballad (Гусарская баллада) as Lieutenant Dmitry Rzhevsky * 1964 — An Easy Life (Легкая жизнь) as Alexander P.

To get to Parry Sound for the summer camp of 1912, the company from Loring had to travel west for 48 km on a wagon road through the bush to catch a CNR train at Salines (later called Drocourt).John Macfie, \\"Now and Then:Footnotes to Parry Sound History\\", pg.104, 1983 ===Regiment command=== When the regiment was first activated it was under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John Henry Knifton who first came to Parry Sound 1895 as the new town clerk. He had 24 years of militia experience with the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada and another nine years with the 36th Peel Regiment. Lieutenant Colonel J.B. Miller was promoted Lieutenant Colonel to command the regiment on 15 September 1909. Miller was the President of the Parry Sound Lumber Company and was appointed Commanding Officer following the retirement of Knifton.Adrian Hayes, \\"Parry Sound:Gateway to Northern Ontario\\", pg.127,2005 ===Regiment badge=== Northern Pioneers Collar Badge Lieutenant-Colonel Knifton commissioned Duncan F. Macdonald to create a badge to represent the regiment. He tried to combine northern objects into the badge; a canoe is recognizable in the final product.John Macfie, \\"Now and Then:Footnotes to Parry Sound History\\", pg.105, 1983 ===War is declared=== War was declared on 4 August 1914. Hundreds of men were members of the Northern Pioneers, yet only a fraction, just a little over 100 members, enlisted in the Great War. The members who did join left Parry Sound on August 20, 1914, for Val Cartier near Quebec City. The Northern Pioneers, being too small of a group to form a battalion, had to blend with the London-based 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion, 1st Brigade, 1st Canadian Contingent.John Macfie, \\"Now and Then:Footnotes to Parry Sound History\\", pg.106, 1983 Francis Pegahmagabow was one of the men who voluntarily enlisted in Parry Sound days after war had been declared and became a member of this 1st battalion.Adrian Hayes, \\"Pegahmagabow:Legendary Warrior, Forgotten Hero\\", pg.21, 2003. ===After the war=== The Northern Pioneers came back into existence after the war and remained in existence until 1936 when it was absorbed into the Algonquin Regiment, based out of North Bay.John Macfie, \\"Now and Then:Footnotes to Parry Sound History\\", pg.105, 1983 ==The 162nd Battalion== The 162nd Battalion on the Court House steps in Parry Sound Ontario, 1916 A year into the First World War the Prime Minister of Canada, Robert Borden, decided the Canadian forces were to be doubled in size to half a million soldiers. This number was going to be difficult to garner since the total population of Canada at the time was around 8 million. A plan was devised by Minister of Militia, Sam Hughes, to turn each electoral district into a battalion area. The thought process was that more people would be willing to enlist if they knew they would be going overseas with their friends and neighbours. The plan worked and on 2 December 1915 the 23rd Regiment in Parry Sound was authorized to raise the 162nd Battalion.John Macfie, \\"Still More...Parry Sound Stories\\", pg157,2014. ===Battalion Numbers and Insignia=== The pin given to the 162nd Battalion. Numbers and insignia were randomly drawn for each battalion; Parry Sound drew 162 whereas the neighbouring Muskoka drew 122. The 162nd Battalion badge was a pair of axes parked in a pine stump. The battalion referred to themselves as the \\"Timber Wolves from Parry Sound\\" due to their lineage tracing back to the 23rd Northern Pioneers, whose badge had the head of a wolf on it.John Macfie, \\"Now and Then:Footnotes to Parry Sound History\\", pg.109-110,1983 ===Call to Arms and Absorption=== Over 700 men enlisted and went to war. On 11 August 1916 the Battalion made its way to Camp Niagara-on-the-Lake for advanced training. On October 31, 1916, the ranks in training in Niagara sailed from Halifax on the Caronia.Adrian Hayes, \\"Parry Sound:Gateway to Northern Ontario\\", pg.132,2005 The 162nd Battalion existed for a short time though. They operated out of Canada from 2 December 1915 to November 1, 1916. They then went to Europe but were only a whole group from 11 November 1916 to 4 January 1917. From that point on they were broken up and absorbed into the 3rd and 4th battalion, used as reinforcement for the Canadian Corps. out in the field.http://cefresearch.ca/matrix/Army%20Corps/Divisions/Reorganized%20Units/Absorbed%20by%20Reserves/162nd%20Battalion.htm The 162nd Battalion in training at the new camp in Niagara-on-the-Lake ==References== Category:Battalions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force Category:Military units and formations of Ontario Category:Parry Sound, Ontario ","title":"162nd (Parry Sound) Battalion, CEF"},{"id":"3228528","text":"Travis Lamon Fisher (born September 12, 1979) is a former American football cornerback.

United States, 498 U.S. 192 (1991), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court reversed the conviction of John L. Cheek, a tax protester, for willful failure to file tax returns and tax evasion. The Court held that an actual good-faith belief that one is not violating the tax law, based on a misunderstanding caused by the complexity of the tax law, negates willfulness, even if that belief is irrational or unreasonable. The Court also ruled that an actual belief that the tax law is invalid or unconstitutional is not a good faith belief based on a misunderstanding caused by the complexity of the tax law, and is not a defense. == Background == The defendant, John L. Cheek, became a pilot for American Airlines in 1973. Through the tax year 1979, Cheek filed Federal income tax returns. Beginning with the 1980 tax year, Cheek stopped filing Federal income tax returns.Dan M. Kahan, \\"Ignorance of Law Is An Excuse -- But Only for the Virtuous,\\" 96 Michigan Law Review 127, 145 (Oct. 1997). He began claiming up to sixty allowances on his Form W-4 withholding statement submitted to his employer.Mark C. Winings, \\"Ignorance Is Bliss Especially for the Tax Evader,\\" 84 Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 575, 582 (Northwestern Univ. School of Law, Fall 1993), at . From 1982 to 1987, Cheek was also involved in at least four civil cases challenging the Federal income tax.See, e.g., Schaut v. United States, 585 F. Supp. 137, 84-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 9308 (N.D. Ill. 1984); Cheek v. Doe, 110 F.R.D. 420, 421 (N.D. Ill. 1984); Cheek v. Commissioner, 53 T.C.M. (CCH) 111, T.C. Memo. 1987-84 (1987). After 1987, see Pleasant v. Lovell, 974 F.2d 1222 (10th Cir. 1992). Among the arguments raised in those cases were: (1) the argument that he was not a taxpayer within the meaning of the law; (2) the argument that wages are not income; (3) the argument that the Sixteenth Amendment does not authorize an income tax on individuals; and (4) the argument that the Sixteenth Amendment is unenforceable. In all four cases, the courts stated that these arguments were erroneous. Cheek also attended two criminal trials of individuals charged with tax crimes.Cheek, 498 U.S. 192 at 194-95 (1991) (hereinafter Cheek). John Cheek himself was eventually charged with six counts of willfully failing to file Federal income tax returns under for 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986. He was also charged with tax evasion under for years 1980, 1981, and 1983.Cheek, 498 U.S. at 194. ===Trial court=== At his own criminal trial, Cheek represented himself.Nicholas A. Mirkay III, \\"The Supreme Court's Decision in Cheek: Does It Encourage Willful Tax Evasion,\\" 56 Missouri Law Review 1119, 1121 (Fall 1991), at .Cheek, 498 U.S. at 195. He also testified that around 1978 he had begun attending seminars conducted by a group that believed that the Federal income tax system was unconstitutional.Dwight W. Stone II, \\"Cheek v. United States: Finally, a Precise Definition of the Willfulness Requirement in Federal Tax Crimes,\\" 51 Maryland Law Review 224, 225 (1992), at . Cheek stated that based on the seminars and his own study, he sincerely believed that the tax laws were being unconstitutionally enforced, and that his actions were lawful. Cheek specifically testified about his own interpretations of the U.S. Constitution, court opinions, common law and other materials. He testified that he had relied on those materials in concluding that he was not required to file tax returns, that he was not required to pay income taxes, and that he could claim refunds of the money withheld from his pay. Cheek also contended that his wages from a private employer (American Airlines) did not constitute income under the internal revenue laws. Cheek argued that he therefore had acted without the \\"willfulness\\" that was required for a criminal tax conviction.Cheek, 498 U.S. at 195-96. ====Ignorance of law==== Under U.S. criminal law, the general rule is that ignorance of the law or a mistake of law is not a valid defense to criminal prosecutionJon Strauss, \\"Nonpayment of Taxes: When Ignorance of the Law Is an Excuse,\\" 25 Akron Law Review 611 (Winter/Spring 1992), at .Cheek, 498 U.S. at 199. (see also Ignorantia juris non excusat). However, there are exceptions to that rule. Some U.S. criminal statutes provide for what are known as \\"specific intent\\" crimes, where ignorance of the law may be a valid defense. The federal criminal tax statutes are examples of statutes for specific intent crimes, where actual ignorance of the law is a valid defense.Cheek, 498 U.S. at 200. ====The erroneous jury instructions==== Cheek was convicted, but during the jury deliberations, the jury asked the trial judge for a clarification on the law. The judge instructed the jury that an \\"honest but unreasonable belief is not a defense, and does not negate willfulness.\\" The trial court also instructed the jury that \\"[a]dvice or research resulting in the conclusion that wages of a privately employed person are not income or that the tax laws are unconstitutional is not objectively reasonable, and cannot serve as the basis for a good faith misunderstanding of the law defense.\\"Cheek, 498 U.S. at 197. ===Appeals=== Cheek appealed his conviction to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which upheld the conviction. The United States Supreme Court issued a writ of certiorari to review the case. At the Court, Cheek contended that the trial court had erred by instructing the jury that a misunderstanding of the law had to be objectively reasonable to negate willfulness. ==Opinion of the Court== In its judgment, the Court produced two essential holdings: ::1. A genuine, good faith belief that one is not violating the Federal tax law based on a misunderstanding caused by the complexity of the tax law (e.g., the complexity of the statute itself) is a defense to a charge of \\"willfulness\\", even though that belief is irrational or unreasonable.Cheek, 498 U.S. at 203.Steven R. Toscher, Dennis L. Perez, Charles P. Rettig & Edward M. Robbins, Jr., Tax Crimes, Tax Management Portfolio, Volume 636, Bloomberg BNA (3d ed. 2012). ::2. A belief that the Federal income tax is invalid or unconstitutional is not a misunderstanding caused by the complexity of the tax law,See generally Dan M. Kahan, \\"Ignorance of Law Is An Excuse -- But Only for the Virtuous,\\" 96 Michigan Law Review 127, 146 (Oct. 1997). and is not a defense to a charge of \\"willfulness\\", even if that belief is genuine and is held in good faith.Lyle Denniston, \\"Court widens use of ignorance plea in tax cases,\\" Baltimore Sun, Jan. 9, 1991, at .Cheek, 498 U.S. at 206. John Cheek's arguments about the constitutionality of the tax law in various prior court cases were expressly labeled \\"frivolous\\" by the Supreme Court. See Cheek, 498 U.S. at 204-205. For example, Cheek had specifically contended prior to his conviction that the Sixteenth Amendment did not authorize a tax on wages and salaries, but only on gain or profit. See Cheek, 498 U.S. at 196. The Supreme Court reiterated that a finding of willfulness in a federal criminal tax case requires proof (1) that the law imposed a duty on the defendant, (2) that the defendant knew of this duty, and (3) that the defendant voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty.Cheek, 498 U.S. at 201. In explaining how the willfulness element must be proven, the Court distinguished arguments about constitutionality of the tax law from statutory arguments about the tax law. In an opinion by Justice White, the Court ruled that the defendant's belief that the tax laws were unconstitutional was not a defense, no matter how honestly that belief might have been held. To the contrary, Cheek's acknowledgement that his failure to file tax returns was based on a belief about constitutionality was viewed by the Supreme Court as possible evidence (1) of Cheek's awareness of the tax law itself (the Court stating that constitutional arguments reveal the taxpayer's \\"full knowledge of the provisions at issue and a studied conclusion, however wrong, that those provisions are invalid and unenforceable\\",Cheek, 498 U.S. at 205.) and (2) of the voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty imposed by the tax law. However, John Cheek's statutory argument--his asserted belief that his wages were not income under the statute (the Internal Revenue Code itself)--was ruled by the Supreme Court to be a possible ground for a valid defense even though that belief was not objectively reasonable, provided that the belief was actually held in good faith. The Supreme Court ruled that by instructing the jury that the defendant's statutory argument had to be based on a belief that was \\"objectively reasonable,\\" the trial judge had erroneously transformed what should have been treated as a factual issue (for the jury to decide) into a legal issue. The Supreme Court stated that whether the defendant acted willfully is a factual issue to be determined by the jury, and that a valid defense of lack of willfulness could be found even though the defendant's belief is not \\"objectively reasonable.\\" The Supreme Court remanded the case to the trial court for a retrial. The Court also provided guidelines that could be used by the jury at the retrial: ::[ . . . ] in deciding whether to credit Cheek's good-faith belief claim, the jury would be free to consider any admissible evidence from any source showing that Cheek was aware of his duty to file a return and to treat wages as income, including evidence showing his awareness of the relevant provisions of the Code or regulations, of court decisions rejecting his interpretation of the tax law, of authoritative rulings of the Internal Revenue Service, or of any contents of the personal income tax return forms and accompanying instructions that made it plain that wages should be returned as income.Cheek, 498 U.S. at 202. ==Dissent== Justice Harry Blackmun, joined by Justice Marshall, agreed with the Court's ruling that a belief that the federal income tax is unconstitutional is not a defense to a charge of willfulness. These two justices complained, however, about the Court's ruling that a genuine, good faith belief based on a misunderstanding of the Internal Revenue Code is a valid defense. In dissent, Justice Blackmun wrote: ::It seems to me that we are concerned in this case not with \\"the complexity of the tax laws,\\" ante, at 200, but with the income tax law in its most elementary and basic aspect: Is a wage earner a taxpayer and are wages income? [ . . . ] [I]t is incomprehensible to me how, in this day, more than 70 years after the institution of our present federal income tax system with the passage of the Revenue Act of 1913, 38 Stat. 166, any taxpayer of competent mentality can assert as his defense to charges of statutory willfulness the proposition that the wage he receives for his labor is not income, irrespective of a cult that says otherwise and advises the gullible to resist income tax collections. One might note in passing that this particular taxpayer, after all, was a licensed pilot for one of our major commercial airlines; he presumably was a person of at least minimum intellectual competence. ==Cheek defense== Some tax protesters have cited this case for the argument that it is possible to avoid paying taxes without punishment by using the kind of defense raised by Cheek about a good faith misunderstanding of the tax law itself. The Cheek defense is available, however, only in a criminal trial, and not as a method to avoid the payment of tax.\\"The ruling does not shield people from being required to pay taxes and any civil penalties that might be imposed for nonpayment.\\" William Grady, \\"High Court Overturns Conviction Of Chicago-area Tax Protester,\\" Jan. 9, 1991, Chicago Tribune, at . In addition, attorney Daniel B. Evans points out that the Cheek Defense is logically self-defeating: > ...[I]f you plan ahead to use it, then it is almost certain to fail, because > your efforts to establish your “good faith belief” are going to be used by > the government as evidence that you knew that what you were doing was wrong > when you did it, which is why you worked to set up a defense in advance. ==Later developments== In the case of John Cheek: ::The 48-year-old airline pilot said in a telephone interview that he had changed his views about paying taxes and was now \\"straightened out with the I.R.S.\\" after paying the money he owed the Government and \\"substantial\\" penalties. From now on, he said, he intended to pay taxes.Linda Greenhouse, \\"Supreme Court Ruling Supports Tax Protester\\", January 9, 1991, New York Times, at . Immediately after the ruling, John Cheek's lawyer, William R. Coulson, stated that Cheek had \\"learned his lesson.\\" Coulson described Cheek as a \\"gullible victim of the tax protest movement\\".William Grady, \\"High Court Overturns Conviction Of Chicago- area Tax Protester,\\" Jan. 9, 1991, Chicago Tribune, at . Further, the case was remanded for a re-trial. In the re-trial, the jury rejected Mr. Cheek's argument that he actually \\"believed\\" that wages were not taxable. He was again convicted. On March 13, 1992, Cheek was sentenced to one year and one day imprisonment, and he was placed on five years probation. The conditions of probation were that he would cooperate with the Internal Revenue Service and pay his back taxes, and pay a fine of $62,000. The second conviction was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and the United States Supreme Court let that decision stand by denying review.United States v. Cheek, 3 F.3d 1057, 93-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,473 (7th Cir. 1993), at cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1112, 114 S. Ct. 1055 (1994). John L. Cheek was released from prison in December 1992.John L.

Kokenis, 743 F. Supp. 2d 988 (N.D. Ill. 2010). That decision has been affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.United States v.

Participants from Portland traveled to Khabarovsk to participate in the games, an event that would not have been possible only a few years before, as the two nations squared off against one another in the Cold War. In 1991, the second Friendship Radiosport Games were held in Portland, hosted by the Friendship Amateur Radio Society, and participants from Khabarovsk traveled to Oregon to attend the event. This would start a tradition of holding the event in August of every odd-numbered year. Extending the event to additional sister cities, the host for the 1993 Friendship Radiosport Games was Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. In addition to competitors from Canada, Russia, and the United States, competitors from the sister city of Niigata, Japan also came to the event in 1993. The 1995 Friendship Radiosport Games were held in Khabarovsk, Russia for the second time, and representatives from all four cities were in attendance. Tokyo, Japan became the fourth host city for the Friendship Radiosport Games when the event has held there in 1997. The 1999 games returned to Portland, Oregon, United States, where the ARDF event was also designated the IARU Region II Championships, the first such IARU sanctioned championships in the Americas. The event returned to Victoria, British Columbia, Canada in 2001, where for the first time competitors from Melbourne, Victoria, Australia were also in attendance. Breaking with the established pattern, the Friendship Radiosport Games were not held in 2003, but were instead held in 2004, again in Khabarovsk, Russia. The invitation to participation was further extended to radio clubs in the Pacific Rim sister cities of Harbin, China, and Bucheon, Korea. === Event History and Location === :1989 - Khabarovsk, Russia :1991 - Portland, Oregon, U.S.A. :1993 - Victoria, British Columbia, Canada :1995 - Khabarovsk, Russia :1997 - Tokyo, Japan :1999 - Portland, Oregon, U.S.A. :2001 - Victoria, British Columbia, Canada :2004 - Khabarovsk, Russia :2008 - Portland, Oregon, U.S.A. :2011 - Khabarovsk, Russia :2016 - Portland, Oregon ==Competition== The Friendship Radiosport Games have traditionally included events from all of the three activities collectively known as radiosport.

In June 1917, the battalion was further reinforced by drafts from the 2nd, 5th, and 12th Reserve Battalions totalling over 400 men. The 164th (Halton and Dufferin) Battalion, CEF was assigned to the 13th Brigade of the 5th Canadian Division, and was based at Witley Camp. On February 12, 1918, it was learned that the 5th Canadian Division would cease to exist. Over the course of the next two months, the battalion was slowly broken up through a series of drafts for frontline units, in particular the 102nd and 116th Battalions, CEF. Sizeable drafts were also sent to the 21st Battalion, CEF, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, and the Canadian Machine Gun Depot at Seaford. On April 16, 1918, the remaining members of the battalion—six officers and 92 other ranks—were absorbed into the 8th Reserve Battalion.

It interchanges with Norfolk Southern in Suffolk. An important industry on the line was the BASF Chemical plant in the West Norfolk area of Portsmouth. The plant was usually switched by locomotive #444, a GP16 class locomotive rebuilt by Seaboard Coast Line Railroad in the early 1980s. The main locomotive was #517, a CF7 rebuild of an EMD F7 performed by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in the 1970s. The BASF plant closed in 2007 and was subsequently demolished.

This port was leased by Maersk to the Virginia Port Authority in late 2010. Commonwealth Railway is the only rail line to access the port. Another port is planned for Craney Island; however, as of 2020 the port is still in the planning stage and has not been constructed. With the opening of this new container port, two EMD SW1500 switch engines were added to the roster. To handle the container traffic to and from the port, the Commonwealth Railway line through the city of Portsmouth has been realigned down the medians of I-664 and SR 164, at a cost of $60 million. A small marshaling yard was built in the Baileytown area of Suffolk. Double-stack container service started in December 2010. A second phase, paid for by $9 million in federal stimulus funding, will further improve port access and is expected to be completed in September 2011. The Commonwealth Railway had two GP20 locomotives numbered 2090 and 2091 which were sold in 2019 to Larry's Truck & Electric (LTEX) in McDonald, Ohio.

The intermediate valley lying between the outer hills and the Mussoorie. The elevation varies from 2000 to . Geologically speaking the Shivaliks belong to the tertiary deposits of the outer Himalayas and are chiefly composed of low sandstone and conglomerate hills, the solidified and upheaved detritus of the great range in their rear. There are a number of pebbled dry rivulets, which come alive during the monsoon season. A dirt road diverts from the highway where a faded billboard announces entry into the reserve forest mainly consisting of Sal trees. ==Flora== === Dense old forest === Kalesar has 53% dense forest, 38% open forest, 9% scrub. Total forest cover is about 71%. Spread over an area of 11,570 acres (46.8 km2), Kalesar reserve forest is the only one of its kind in Haryana. Besides the tall, leafy sal trees that constitute the dense age-old forest belt of the Doon valley, there are other trees like Semul, Amaltas and Bahera. khair, shisham, sain, jhingan, chhal (Anogeissus latifolia) also found in the forest. It is the only forest in Haryana with a natural Sal tree belt. Among the flora is the small sindoor tree — it has dainty flowers, which turn into pods to produce the vermilion sindoor that adorns the tresses of married women. Climbers snake up the tree stems, and the forest floor is littered with fallen leaves and foliage plants. Sculptural anthills dot the landscape. There is a long stretch of man-made forest clearing and a 'fire line' which helps in containing forest fires. === Medicinal plants === In the jungle, there is a machaan (high observation tower) with a dangerous-looking service ladder. From top the effort is rewarded by a sweeping panorama of the 11000 acres (45 km2) of the great sal forest; criss-crossed by fire lines and meandering rivulets.

FC initially met in a rented facility next to the Irving Arts Center and across from MacArthur High School. Thus, it moved across the parking lot to the nearby Irving Arts Center. During this time, FC tried the concept of \\"simultaneous services\\"—one group would meet at FC's facility while another would meet at the Arts Center. The FC music team would play at one site while Young preached at the other, then midway through the services the teams would switch places. The concept proved unsuccessful and was shortly dropped. Meanwhile, FC began to look for a suitable site for its permanent facility. FC discovered a site on heavily traveled State Highway 121 north of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, which was being auctioned by the Resolution Trust Corporation. Though larger than FC wanted, FC did not have the option to bid on only a portion of the site—it had to bid on the entire site or not bid at all. FC agreed to bid on the site, and was the successful bidder; however, it had to borrow $1.675 million to make the payment. Approximately two years later, the announcement was made that Grapevine Mills would be built across the street from FC. Unsolicited offers came in for portions of the FC property, and eventually FC sold a parcel on the north side of the property for the exact amount it had borrowed earlier, thus allowing it to begin construction debt-free.

Festival was a gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender arts festival in Glasgow, Scotland. From 1993-2014 it was part of the diversity of Glasgow's cultural scene, an annual Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Arts Festival held usually in October/November, formerly organised by GALA Scotland Ltd. ==History== Glasgay! was as an annual arts festival that ran from 1993 to 2014. The operating Company, GALA Scotland Ltd, (now known as Outspoken Arts Scotland Limited) was established in April 1995. The festival was a multi-art form festival of professional work by LGBT performing artists. The programme encompassed theatre, dance, literature, film, music and comedy events and appeared in dozens of venues across the city of Glasgow, Scotland. At its height it was one of the UK's largest multi-arts festival for LGBT people (and their friends), celebrating artistic talent and diversity as well as providing a platform for aspiring artists. It was founded as a direct response the Section 28 legislation banning the promotion of homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle. Glasgay! launched on Saturday 30 October 1993. This lesbian and gay arts festival was the innovation of Cordelia Ditton, well known in national arts scene as a performer, writer, and co-director of Gay Sweatshop. The introduction of Section 28 in 1988 galvanised a whole new era of political and public agitation and resulted also in the founding in 1989 of the influential national lobbying group Stonewall (charity). Cordelia Ditton had been involved in the campaign against Section 28 and recognised that important local organisations such as the Glasgow branch of Switchboard already existed. However, it was her idea that a lesbian and gay arts festival, would make the lesbian and gay communities of Glasgow more visible. In 1991 she joined forces with Glasgow-based freelance arts administrator Dominic D’Angelo. Both were determined to produce an arts festival that would show gay lifestyles and performers and work in a very, very positive light. The mission was to change public opinion about lesbian and gay people and to show the wealth of amazing work that was out there. The 1993 Festival opened to huge acclaim garnering audiences of just over 26,000 attenders. However, there were hateful campaigns in the press, from Tory Councillors and members of the public de-crying the use of public money on such gay art. Despite this backlash the festival was initially established as a biennial event. After the 1995 edition Cordelia Ditton stepped down and a new board of directors, led by Dominic D'Angelo and others was convened and the charity Gala Scotland Ltd established. This company then carried forward the legacy and produced the festival from 1996 to 2014. The work of the festival was always dominated by the prevailing social climate in terms of acceptance, tolerance and understanding of LGBT rights, equality and the march of progress. That social progress has resulted in the repealing of Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1998; and enactment of new equality laws, the Civil Partnership Act (2004) and The Equality Act (2010). Glasgay! artists across the generations always presented work that continually reflected social attitudes, behaviours and experiences of the LGBT community. The Glasgay! Festival was a place where LGBT life was acknowledged, celebrated and understood. Over the 21 years of its history the festival was funded mainly on a year to year basis by the Scottish Arts Council and, subsequently its successor, Creative Scotland and Glasgow City Council. From 2007 to 2014 it enjoyed regular 3 year funding agreements from the Scottish Arts Council/Creative Scotland. In 2015 the Company was unsuccessful in its bid to become a new RFO client and the Board was asked to consider the future of the festival without the support of Creative Scotland. The Company was also asked to consider its national role as a promoter of equality and the broader protected characteristics. It was clear that whilst the festival clearly enjoyed strong support in Glasgow the need to spread the message of equality, particularly to outer-lying communities was the principal challenge. The Company agreed to enter a period of funding transition and the board took the bold step of retiring the festival and renaming the charity, rebranding and re-purposing the mission. A new name Outspoken Arts Scotland was chosen to reflect the campaigning roots of the festival as the legacy of a movement. A new mission was adopted to work in outerlying communities and to work across all, or most, of the protected characteristics. This transition period lasted for nearly two years 2015-2017 and the Company delivered a number of projects across that period. The Company continues to be funded by Creative Scotland & Glasgow City Council and since 2018 by Renfrewshire Council. Archives: The entire administrative, artistic, press & PR archive of the Glasgay! Festival 1993-2014 was transferred to Glasgow University's Scottish Theatre Archive in Spring 2018. This archive is still being catalogued and documented but reference to it should eventually appear at this link. ==Past work== The company commissioned 16 new works for theatre and funded over 40 co- productions since 2006. It worked with over 400 artists in its lifetime and regularly engaged both established mature talent as well as championing emergent talent. In its history the festival has worked with many of the top gay and lesbian artists in the world. Names such as Ian McKellen, Simon Fanshawe, Donna McPhail, Edwin Morgan, Jackie Kay, Rhona Cameron, Annie Sprinkle, Penny Arcade, Bette Bourne, Diamanda Galas, Neil Bartlett, Scott Capurro, Pam Ann, Four Poofs and a Piano, Lypsinka, Louise Welsh, Marc Almond, Alan Carr, Zoë Strachan, Stewart Laing, and John Waters are amongst the many others that have graced Glasgow's stages. ==Commissions== Commissioned Work (Year) Writer/Creators 1\\\\.

He was educated at Friars School, Bangor, at the time an all-boys grammar school. His father, Sir Wynn Wheldon, was a prominent educationalist who had been awarded the DSO for gallantry in the First World War. His grandfather, Tomos Jones Wheldon, had been the Moderator of the Calvinist Methodist Church in Wales. His mother, Megan Edwards, was an accomplished pianist. ==Military service== On the outbreak of war in 1939, Wheldon enlisted in the Buffs. He was commissioned into the Royal Welch Fusiliers in 1940, but subsequently volunteered for the airborne forces and joined the Royal Ulster Rifles, with whom he flew into Normandy. He was awarded the Military Cross for an act of bravery on D-Day + 1. ==Broadcasting career== After the war Wheldon joined the Arts Council of Wales, and then in 1951 became the Arts Council's administrator for the Festival of Britain, work for which he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1952. In 1952 he joined the BBC as a publicity officer, but he was keen to make programmes, and he made his first appearance on television running a nationwide conker competition, and thence became a familiar face on children's TV with his programme All Your Own. Future Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page was a guest on his show in 1957. He also began to produce and present adult programmes, such as Men in Battle with Sir Brian Horrocks, and Portraits of Power with Robert McKenzie. He was also responsible for Orson Welles' Sketchbook (1955). It was with the arts magazine programme Monitor that Wheldon truly made his mark on the cultural scene. He was the editor of the programme – in the sense in which a newspaper has an editor – and he set about moulding a team of exceptional talents, including John Schlesinger, Ken Russell, Humphrey Burton, and Melvyn Bragg. Monitor ranged in subject over all the arts: the hundredth show was Elgar (1962), a film directed by Ken Russell and written by Wheldon, that celebrated the composer Edward Elgar. Monitor featured specially made films, sometimes just one full-length item, eventually using actors to re- enact the subjects' lives. Prior to this, only photos or location shots had been used in programmes. Wheldon's Monitor lasted until he had \\"interviewed everyone I am interested in interviewing\\"; he was succeeded by Jonathan Miller for the series' last season. In 1967 he was invited to deliver the MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He chose the subject \\"Perspectives on Television\\". Wheldon then entered BBC management, becoming by turns Head of Documentaries and then Controller, BBC1. In 1968 he became Managing Director, BBC TV, a position he held until compulsory retirement in 1975. During this time he again gathered a team of the talents about him, promoting fellow programme makers such as David Attenborough and Paul Fox to high executive office, and the period of his administration, which included programmes such as Dad's Army, Kenneth Clark's Civilisation, Alistair Cooke's America, and Jacob Bronowski's The Ascent of Man (the last two were co-productions with Time-Life Television). After he retired from management Wheldon co-wrote, with J. H. Plumb, and presented Royal Heritage, a ten-part series on the history of the British monarchy as expressed through the Royal Collections. Produced by Michael Gill, it achieved immense popularity ratings in 1977, the year of the Queen's Silver Jubilee. Two other major documentaries followed, The Library of Congress and Destination D-Day. ==Later life== Wheldon was knighted in 1976. Following his retirement from the BBC he became Chairman of the Court of the Governors of the London School of Economics, where he had read economics before the war. He disarmed potential sponsors of the school by eschewing flattery and opening negotiations with the bald statement that what he was after was their cash. He was also a formidable and active President of the Royal Television Society (RTS). An RTS Memorial Lecture in his name by a distinguished broadcaster is televised annually. Brian Cox gave the lecture in 2010; the following year it was given by Bettany Hughes. Other speakers have included David Attenborough, Jeremy Isaacs and, in 2005, the writer Paul Abbott. In addition to this, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) dispenses a Huw Wheldon Award for Specialist Factual Programme. There are also Wheldon bursaries and awards at the LSE and the University of Wales, Bangor. Sir Huw's lasting influence, other than as a programme maker, which was considerable, probably lies in the ways in which he articulated the needs and requirements of public service broadcasting. \\"To make the good popular and the popular good\\", \\"the aim is not to avoid failure, but to attempt success\\", \\"multiplicity does not mean choice\\", were among his favourite sayings. He also coined the term \\"narrowcasting\\". Wheldon died of cancer in 1986. His ashes were spread anonymously in the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, where he had served as a Trustee, and which he had loved. Sir Huw Wheldon was highly regarded in the United States, where he had many friends, one of whom, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, caused Norman Podhoretz's obituary of his friend Wheldon, a version of which had first appeared in Podhoretz's syndicated column, to be entered into the Congressional Record. Wheldon was married to the novelist Jacqueline Wheldon. They had three children. Sir Huw's son, Wynn Wheldon (named after his grandfather), is his biographer. ==References== ==External links== * Interview with Wynn Wheldon about Huw Wheldon * http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/473425/ Category:1916 births Category:1986 deaths Category:BAFTA fellows Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment) soldiers Category:Royal Welch Fusiliers officers Category:Royal Ulster Rifles officers Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:People from Prestatyn Category:People educated at Friars School, Bangor Category:People associated with the London School of Economics Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:Deaths from cancer in England Category:BBC people Category:British broadcasters Category:International Emmy Directorate Award Category:BBC executives Category:Governors of the London School of Economics Category:Alumni of the London School of Economics Category:Operation Overlord people ","title":"Huw Wheldon"},{"id":"3228617","text":"Mouling National Park is a national park located in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, spread primarily over the Upper Siang district and parts of the West Siang and East Siang district. It was the second national park to be created in the state, after Namdapha National Park in 1972.Mouling National Park - the House of Red Poison , India-north-east.com The Mouling National Park and the Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary are located fully or partly within Dihang-Dibang Biosphere Reserve. ==Name== The park is named after the nearby Mouling peak. Mouling is an Adi word which means red poison or red blood, which is believed to be red latex from a tree species found locally. The area is thought to have a large number of poisonous snakes, but this cannot be verified as the ecology of the area has been sparsely explored. Moulíng means (among = soil/land and yalíng = red), from among (mo) yalíng (líng). Therefore, moulíng should be read as red soil. == Geography == The national park covers an area of about 483 km² forming the western part of the Dihang- Dibang Biosphere Reserve. The terrain is rugged with an altitudinal range of 750 to 3064 m at the highest point, the Mouling Peak. The Siyom river flows along the Western fringes of the park and several small rivers such as the Siring, Krobong, Semong and Subong drain into the Siang river near the eastern boundary of the park. The park is under the administrative control of the Divisional Forest Office located in Jengging and the nearest major towns are Along and Pasighat, 130 km and 185 km from the park. Approach to the park is not possible via roads, due to the remoteness of the area and communication facilities in the area are poor. The nearest airfield is located in Along. The Forest Department’s managerial control is limited by the lack of road communication and all the divisional/range/beat offices are located well outside the park. The park boundaries have been drawn through an aerial survey based on artificial and natural boundaries such as the Siyom River in the west, and on-ground demarcation of sections of the boundary is still not complete. The park has two ranges; the Ramsing range accessible from the Bomdo village and the Jengging range accessible from the Lissing village. The area is extremely humid, with heavy rainfall (2343 mm annually) and no well-defined dry season. In low altitude temperature ranges between 15 °C to 38 °C, Winter snowfall is experienced in higher altitudes. Temperature varies from 4.2 °C to 17.7 °C at altitudes ranging from 2,200 m onwards. == Biology & Ecology == The area around Mouling National park is one of great bio-diversity, with a juxtaposition of different biotopes, and is often called the state's cradle of biodiversity. With elevations ranging from 400 m to over 3000 m in the park, it forms a transition zone between tropical forests at lower altitudes to most temperate forest at altitudes above 2800 m. The overall inaccessibility due to poor or no roads and stories associated with the forest itself have kept the core area of the national park relatively untouched by human activities. There has been evidence of past practices of jhum cultivation, especially in the Northern and South-eastern areas of the park. Animals such as the takin, goral, Indian leopard, Bengal tiger, barking deer, serow and red panda are living there. == References == Category:Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests Category:Himalayan subtropical pine forests Category:Protected areas of Arunachal Pradesh ","title":"Mouling National Park"},{"id":"3228624","text":"165th Battalion The 165th (French Acadian) Battalion, CEF was a unit in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War.

It was created in 1986 by Canadian programmer Steven Halls. It is the first animated talking agent on a personal computer and featured a moose that would appear at periodic intervals with some joke or witticism. The moose would also comment on system events and user actions and could speak what a user typed using the Moose Proof desk accessory. ==Design== According to Halls, the original purpose of the moose was to make use of the Mac's Macintalk text-to- speech engine in a novel manner. A Doonesbury strip in which the characters were commented on by a talking computer provided inspiration, and Halls found that a moose head with antlers was recognizable even on low-resolution computer screens. The moose was the first facially animated talking agent with lip synchronization and it became the seed idea for future talking agents, such as Clippy the paperclip in Microsoft Windows, Bonzi Buddy, and Prody Parrot from Creative SoundBlaster. The Talking Moose used Apple's Macintalk software, the first version of which famously made the original \\"Never trust a computer you can't lift\\" speech at the Macintosh launch in 1984. Apple's development of Macintalk had petered out and they granted Halls permission to use, and continue refining, the software for free. Halls did not just improve the fluidity of the speech and the reliability of the interpretation but gave the moose a library of comedic observations and wisecracks which gave it a distinctive character. Around 1990, a version of the Talking Moose software was commercially published by Baseline Publishing. This commercial release of the Talking Moose included color graphics and additional software that allowed users to create and edit phrases to be spoken. A stripped-down version of the Baseline release of the Talking Moose was distributed with the Bob LeVitus book Stupid Mac Tricks in 1989. In the 1990s, the Moose was rewritten by Uli Kusterer under the name Uli's Moose - for which he later obtained Steve Halls' blessing. This Moose was included in Bob LeVitus' iMac (and iBook) book \\"I Didn't Know You Could Do That\\". ==Moose Versions== Version 1.0 of the Talking Moose was released in 1986 by Steve Halls. Version 2.0 was released in 1987, and ran on Macintosh systems 6.0.4 - 7.1. The Macintalk voice used for the Moose was 'Fred'. Around 1990, Baseline Publishing commercially published the talking moose, and released version 4, introducing new characters from a \\"Cartoon Carnival\\" supposedly run by the titular ungulate. Uli Kusterer - the next author of the moose - got rid of the cartoon carnival, and worked more in the spirit of the original moose, releasing new versions starting at 1.0, which supported Mac OS 7.1 - 9.2. These were released initially on CompuServe, and later on the internet. He also developed the first OS X native version (v 3.0). The latest Macintosh version of the Moose (v3.5.7) works with all versions of OS X, 10.3 through 10.7, and includes Universal Binaries. From January 8, 2009, The Talking Moose has been posting periodic comments to a Twitter account.

On November 23, 1861, Sheldon joined Company E of the 7th Vermont Infantry Regiment and then entered active service in 1862 as a sergeant at Rutland, Vermont. On July 13, 1865, he became a captain and was then mustered out at Brownsville, Texas. Sheldon's last year in the military was spent on the western frontier. After leaving the Army, Sheldon entered the mercantile business in Pope County, Illinois. Sheldon's first wife, Mary Walters Sheldon, died in 1874. They had two children. His second wife was Martha Frizell Sheldon with whom he had three children. ==Career== After spending his last year in Illinois at Chicago, Charles Sheldon moved to Groton in Brown County, Dakota Territory because of the health of his son, James. Doctors had told Sheldon that only a northern climate could help his son, who was suffering from malaria. Sheldon settled on government land and became a farmer. Sheldon entered politics in 1886, when he represented the twelfth legislative district in the Territorial Legislature.

In 1832, he moved with his family to Michigan. The Edmunds family was involved with politics, associating with the Free Soilers before affiliating with the Republican Party. Newton Edmunds' brother, C. E. Edmunds, was Commissioner of the United States Land Office. Newton Edmunds was appointed as chief clerk in the surveyor-general's office, resulting in Edmunds' arrival in Dakota Territory in 1861. On August 30, 1862, Edmunds was elected as eighth corporal of Company A of the Dakota Militia, following the Santee uprising. ===Governor of Dakota Territory=== On October 17, 1863, Edmunds was appointed Governor of Dakota Territory by President Abraham Lincoln after receiving strong support from former Governor William Jayne. Edmunds took the oath of office on November 2. He helped establish a public school system as well as a regular revenue system in Dakota Territory. Edmunds also promoted advanced farming techniques and successfully introduced sheep to Dakota Territory in 1865. Edmunds also believed that warring conditions with the Indians in the territory impeded white settlement by creating a negative public perception of Dakota Territory. In October 1865, Edmunds and his commission began to negotiate with Indian tribes located along the Missouri River; and eventually, the commission reached treaty agreements with thirteen tribes. Dr. Walter A. Burleigh opposed Governor Edmunds' peace policy with the Indians, recommending that Edmunds be dismissed from office, claiming that Edmunds had mismanaged Indian Affairs with a scheme to steal money from the Indian Bureau. On August 8, 1866, Edmunds was dismissed by President Andrew Johnson and was replaced by Andrew Jackson Faulk, father-in-law of Dr. Burleigh. ===Later life and death=== After leaving office, Edmunds remained involved in both business and politics in Dakota Territory. Edmunds continued to serve in treaty commissions to negotiate with Indian tribes. He played a role in establishing rail service between Yankton and Sioux City. In 1873, Edmunds and Leighton Wynn opened the Yankton State Bank. During the 1880s, he joined the statehood movement, attending the first constitutional convention in Sioux Falls September 1883. In September 1891, Edmunds and his two sons established the Yankton National Bank. Edmunds remained active in business in Yankton until the time of his death on February 13, 1908. Newton Edmunds is the namesake of Edmunds County, South Dakota. In 1964, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. ==Notes== Category:1819 births Category:1908 deaths Category:Governors of Dakota Territory Category:People from Hartland, New York Category:People from Michigan Category:People of North Dakota in the American Civil War ","title":"Newton Edmunds"},{"id":"3228690","text":"Gov. John L. Pennington John L. Pennington (1829July 9, 1900) was an American politician and newspaper publisher. He was an Alabama state senator, and the fifth Governor of Dakota Territory.John Pennington ==Biography== Pennington was born at the town of New Berne in Craven County, North Carolina. He started a career in journalism by working as an apprentice for the \\"Raleigh Star.\\" In 1856, Pennington founded the \\"Columban\\" in Columbia, South Carolina. In 1857, he founded the \\"Daily Progress\\" in New Bern, North Carolina. After leaving the newspaper business in 1866, Pennington became a member of the Republican party and joined the carpetbaggers in Alabama, where he served as a member of the Alabama legislature until 1873. On January 1, 1874, Pennington was appointed as Governor of Dakota Territory by President Ulysses S. Grant after a recommendation by George E. Spencer. In 1875, Pennington County was established and named after the governor. During Pennington's time as governor, the gold rush was starting in the Black Hills; Jack McCall was tried and hanged in Yankton for the murder of \\"Wild Bill\\" Hickok; and, railroad construction and immigration had both slowed. People in the Black Hills wanted control over their own political future; and, separatists wanted to form their own territory called Lincoln. In the spring of 1877, Judge Granville was assigned to the Black Hills judicial district; and as a result, the separatist movement ended. Because of his lack of popularity in the Black Hills and negative reports on his character in Yankton, Pennington was replaced by William Alanson Howard as Governor of Dakota Territory in April 1878. He was part of the \\"Yankton Gang\\" that tried to consolidate territorial power in their city. However, Pennington was considered to be more honest than most of the appointed governors and he continued to live in Yankton after leaving the governorship. He built several houses and a major commercial structure in the city. Governor Howard appointed Pennington as collector of internal revenue for Dakota Territory. In 1885, Pennington returned to journalism and established the \\"Weekly Telegram\\" at Yankton. In September 1883, Pennington attended the constitutional convention in Sioux Falls, where he opposed dividing Dakota Territory into two states. In 1891, Pennington left Yankton, South Dakota, to resume journalism in the South. He died in Anniston, Alabama and is buried at the Oxford Cemetery in nearby Oxford, Alabama. Governor Pennington's home at 410 E. Third Street in Yankton, built in 1875, is one of that city's most historical structures and the only territorial governor's home still standing. Pennington was a journalist; the house is now home to South Dakota Magazine, a publication that explores the history and culture of the state. Two smaller houses also built by Pennington are part of the magazine's small campus. ==References== Category:1821 births Category:1900 deaths Category:Alabama state senators Category:Governors of Dakota Territory Category:Politicians from Anniston, Alabama Category:People from Yankton, South Dakota Category:Politicians from New Bern, North Carolina Category:Alabama Republicans Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"John L.

Ring expansion and ring contraction reactions in the course of organic synthesis refer to a set of reactions which can lead to the expansion or contraction of an existing ring. This often makes it possible to access structures that would be difficult if not impossible to synthesise with single cyclization reactions. Ring expansions are valuable because they allow access to larger systems that are difficult to synthesize through a single cyclization due to the slow rate of formation. Ring contractions are useful for making smaller, more strained rings from larger rings. Expansions are classified by the mechanism of expansion and the atom(s) added; contractions are characterized simply by the reactive intermediate which performs the contraction. == Description == In the course of an organic synthesis, a chemist often needs to form a new or alter an existing ring. Ring expansion and ring contraction reactions are used to expand or contract an existing ring, often making it possible to access structures that would be difficult if not impossible to synthesise with single cyclization reactions. == Ring expansion reactions == A scheme showing ring expansion by exocyclic bond migration (A) and ring opening of a bicyclic molecule (B). Ring expansions are valuable because they allow access to larger systems that are difficult to synthesize through a single cyclization due to the slow rate of formation (seven member and larger rings). Classifying ring expansions by the mechanism of expansion and the atom(s) added allows one to see the similarities between different expansions methods and different incorporated atoms. The broadest classification comes by the mechanism of expansion. The rings can be expanded by attack of the ring onto an outside group already appended to the ring (a migration/insertion), opening of a bicycle to a single larger ring, or coupling a ring closing with an expansion. These expansions can be further broken down by what type of atom they incorporate (a carbon or a heteroatom) into the expanded ring. === Carbon insertion reactions === Carbon insertions are tremendously useful reactions which introduce an additional carbon atom into the ring. These reactions are used in the synthesis of many drugs and natural products. These can proceed through any of the mechanisms listed below. The bond migration step of the pinacol type rearrangement. ==== Carbon insertion through migration to an exocyclic group ==== These reactions have the general features of having an exocyclic leaving group on a carbon adjacent to the ring and an electron donating group on the ring capable of initiating a migration of an endocyclic bond. A common migration introduction of carbon is a pinacol rearrangement. While this reaction refers specifically to a vicinal dihydroxide rearrangement, there are other pinacol type rearrangements that proceed through the same general mechanism such as the Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement. These \\"semipinacol rearrangements occur under milder conditions and are thus preferable in complex syntheses. These reactions are useful beyond simply expanding a ring because the exocyclic group attacked may also have other functionality appended to it besides the leaving group. The group to which the endocyclic bond migrates can also be selectively added to the ring based on the functionality already present, for example 1,2 addition into a cyclic ketone. ==== Carbon insertion through opening of a bicycle ==== A generalized mechanism of the Buchner ring expansion. Carbon introduction through the opening of a bicyclic system is another way to introduce either a single carbon or several at a time to a ring. The single carbon introduction often goes through a cyclopropane containg bicyclic intermediate, which is subsequently opened to give the expanded ring. The expansion can occur either through an electrocylic ring opening or by an induced cleavage of the shared bond. These reactions are differentiated in terms of how the carbon is added to form the cyclopropane ring. A Simmons-Smith like reaction with an alkene containing ring can be used to introduce a single carbon. Other methods exist to cyclopropantate other functionalities, such as the Buchner ring expansion fornucleophihlic attack (A) and neighboring group donation (B).The formation of the cyclopropane ring in a single carbon expansion allows the introduction of additional functionality along with the ring expansion, provided the additional functionality is appended to the carbon being inserted. The target of cyclopropanation also varies depending on the conditions used. The Simmons- Smith reaction adds to alkenes while the Buchner ring expansion allows addition to typically unreactive arenes. The Buchner ring expansion is useful because it gives cycloheptatrienes as the ring opened products, which are found in the core of some natural products, such as azulenes. An important consideration in these ring expansions is the ring opening to an expanded ring and not an exocyclic group on the original ring or an unopenable product. The Buchner ring expansion is encouraged to open to the desired product by placing electron withdrawing groups on the carbon added. In order to perform the ring opening on saturated bicyclic molecules the cyclopropane must be introduced such that a neighboring group can facilitate the expansion or the ring must be opened by attackate the expansion or the ring must be opened by attack from an outside group. Ring opening as a means of ring expansion can also be applied to larger systems to give access to even larger ring syscyclization. The Grob fragmentation can be applied as an example of such an expansion. Like the pinacol type migration the Grob fragmentation relies on an electron donating group to promote the bond migration and encourage the leaving group to be expelled. In this case the electron donating group can be a pseudo electron donating group which is capable of eliminating and donating an electron pair into the carbon with the breaking bond. Working with two smaller rings can allow for elaboration of two parts of the molecule separately before working with the expanded ring. The Dowd-Beckwith ring expansion is also capable of adding several carbons to a ring at a time,e of adding several carbons to a ring at a time, and is a useful tool for making large rings. While it proceeds through an intermediate bicycle the final cyclization and ring opening take place within the same radical reaction.Dowd, P.; Choi; S. C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 3493–3494 This expansion is useful because it allows the expansion of a beta-ketoester to a large cyclic ketone which can easily be elaborated using either the cyclic ketone or the exocyclic ester.The bond migration steps in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation (A) and the Beckmann rearrangement (B). === Heteroatom insertion reactions === Heteroatom additions to rings can occur through ring expansions if not they are not done through de-novo ring synthesis. These introductions are primarily ring expansions because they often take place through migration/insertion pathways similar to those mentioned above for carbon. Examples include high impact applications of the Beckmann rearrangement (for introduction of nitrogen into codeine) and the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation (introduction of oxygen to cage-annulated ethers) in synthesis. Both occur with the expulsion of a leaving group as the alkyl group migrates onto the exocyclic heteroatom, which is strikingly similar to the pinacol type rearrangement. == Ring contraction reactions == Ring contraction through anionic (A), cationic (B), and carbenoid (C) reactive intermediates. Ring contractions are useful for making smaller, more strained rings from larger rings. The impetus for making these rings comes from the difficulty associated with making a fully elaborated small ring when such a ring could more easily be made from an elaborated larger ring, from which an atom can be excised, or that the original larger scaffold is more accessible.Silva, L.F. Tetrahedron 2002, 9137–9161 Ring contractions are easily characterized simply by the reactive intermediate which performs the contraction. The standard intermediates are anionic, cationic, and carbenoid. === Anionic contractions === The Favorskii rearrangement is the poster child of the anionic ring contractions. It proceeds through a carbanion which attacks an endocyclic carbon and expels a leaving group (a halide) forming a bicyclic molecule with rings smaller than the original. The bicycle is then opened by nucleophilic attack on the ketone to give the contracted product. A generalized mechanism of the Favorskii rearrangement to give a ring contracted product. Note that anion formation has been omitted. An alternative to the standard Favorskii rearrangement, is to perform what can be thought of as a negative pinacol rearrangement where an anionic group encourages a bond aligned with a leaving group to migrate and expel the leaving group, which has been used in several syntheses. It should also be noted that the so-called \\"quasi-Favorskii rearrangement\\" proceeds without an additional nucleophile to form the final contracted product. A general pinacol type rearrangement to an unequal 5,7 ring system. === Cation contractions === The cationic rearrangement contraction proceeds through the loss of a leaving group and the migration of an endocyclic bond to the carbocation. Pinacol type rearrangements are often used for this type of contraction. Like the expansion reaction this proceeds with an electron donating group aiding in the migration. Contraction reactions of one ring can be coupled with an expansion of another to give an unequal bicycle from equally sized fused ring. These cationic rearrangements have found use to synthesize the cores of complex molecules. === Carbenoid contractions === alt= The Wolff rearrangement can be used to perform ring contractions. It proceeds through a carbenoid generated from decomposition of a diazoketone, which inserts into the carbon-carbon bond on the opposite side of the ketone. ==References== Category:Rearrangement reactions ","title":"Ring expansion and contraction"},{"id":"3228756","text":"Maria's Wedding is a graphic novel published by Oni Press, written by Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir, with art by Jose Garibaldi. ==Plot== Maria's Wedding is a comedy-drama about a wedding at a large Italian family, the first traditional wedding since the family was split into bickering sides over a gay wedding.

Maksim Maksimovich Kovalevsky (8 September 1851 – 5 April 1916) was a Russian jurist and the main authority on sociology in the Russian Empire. He was vice-president (1895) and president (1905) of the International Institute of Sociology. He also held a chair in sociology at the Psycho- Neurological Institute. Kovalevsky was elected into the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1914. The Russian Sociological Society adopted his name in 1916. ==Life== Maksim Kovalevsky was born into a Ukrainian noble family and spent his childhood in a manor near Kharkov. He studied at the University of Kharkov under Dmitri Kachenovsky. He furthered his education in Berlin, Paris, and London, where he made the acquaintance of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Herbert Spencer, and Vladimir Solovyov. He also became involved in the Masonic movement, contributing to its revival in Russia. After 1878, he read lectures in law at the University of Moscow, where he studied the Russian peasant commune and legal institutions of Caucasian highlanders. Some of his materials were later used by Frederick Engels. Minister Ivan Delyanov did not approve of Kovalevsky's liberal views. In 1886, Kovalevsky was kicked out of the university and then settled in Western Europe, where he came to know all major sociologists and anthropologists of his day. His cousin's widow, mathematician Sofia Kovalevskaya, arranged for him a lecture program at the University of Stockholm. He is portrayed as her lover and fiancé in the Soviet film \\"Sofia Kovalevskaya\\" (1985) and in \\"Too Much Happiness\\" (2009), a short story by Alice Munro published in the August 2009 issue of Harper's Magazine. Sofia was \\"adamant that she would not marry Maksim, fearing that if she did, he would begin to take her for granted and look for a mistress\\".Quoted from: Vadim B. Kuznetsov. The Kowalewsky Property. American Mathematical Soc., 2002. Page 18. They parted in 1890. After the First Russian Revolution, Kovalevsky resumed his lectures in Russia (in the University of Saint Petersburg), became involved in politics, established a centrist party of democratic reforms (see Progressist Party), was elected into the first State Duma, and appointed into the State Council of the Russian Empire. In 1912 he was nominated for a Nobel peace prize. He was scheduled to take part in the peace negotiations for ending World War I but died in April 1916. The crowd that had attended the funeral at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra was enormous. ===Freemasonry=== Initiated to three craft degree March 14, 1888, in Paris, in the Russian lodge \\"Cosmos\\".

Was Worshipful Master Lodge \\"Renaissance\\".http://samisdat.com/5/23/523r-voz.htm ==Ideas== Among Kovalevsky's contributions to Russian jurisprudence and social science was a new historical method which combined traditional descriptive comparative analysis with sociological/ethnographic methods. Among his disciples were Pitirim Sorokin, Nikolai Kondratiev, and Nicholas Timasheff (see Sociology in Russia). His early work on the peasant commune influenced Georgy Plekhanov. As a scholar Kovalevsky was a social evolutionist and called himself a disciple of Auguste Comte. He defined sociology as \\"the science dealing with the organization and evolution of societies\\".Quoted from: Andrzej Walicki. A History of Russian Thought: From the Enlightenment to Marxism. Stanford University Press, 1979. Pages 367–368. He believed in progress as one of the inexorable laws of history. For him progress was \\"the constant expansion of the environment of peaceful coexistence from tribal unity through patriotism to cosmopolitanism\\". According to Kovalevsky, economic relations are bound to expand ever further, and the growth of international trade \\"would bring about the economic integration of the whole world, eliminating the causes of war, and ultimately lead to a world federation of democratic states\\". Progress depends on population growth as its main driving force. ==See also== * List of Russian legal historians * Russian legal history ==References== ==Further reading== * Leo Pasvolsky, \\"M.M.

This is accomplished by letting the ionizing radiation emitted by the radioactive isotopes hit a luminescent material (scintillator or phosphor), which in turn emits photons that generate electricity upon striking a photovoltaic cell. The technology was developed by researchers of the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow. == Description == A beta emitter such as technetium-99 or strontium-90 is suspended in a gas or liquid containing luminescent gas molecules of the excimer type, constituting a \\"dust plasma\\". This permits a nearly lossless emission of beta electrons from the emitting dust particles. The electrons then excite the gases whose excimer line is selected for the conversion of the radioactivity into a surrounding photovoltaic layer such that a lightweight, low-pressure, high-efficiency battery can be realised. These nuclides are relatively low-cost radioactive waste from nuclear power reactors. The diameter of the dust particles is so small (a few micrometers) that the electrons from the beta decay leave the dust particles nearly without loss. The surrounding weakly ionized plasma consists of gases or gas mixtures (such as krypton, argon, and xenon) with excimer lines such that a considerable amount of the energy of the beta electrons is converted into this light. The surrounding walls contain photovoltaic layers with wide forbidden zones, such as diamond, which convert the optical energy generated from the radiation into electrical energy. A German patent provides a description of an optoelectric nuclear battery, which would consist of an excimer of argon, xenon, or krypton (or a mixture of two or three of them) in a pressure vessel with an internal mirrored surface, finely-ground radioisotope, and an intermittent ultrasonic stirrer, illuminating a photocell with a bandgap tuned for the excimer. When the beta- emitting nuclides (e.g., krypton-85 or argon-39) emit beta particles, they excite their own electrons in the narrow excimer band at a minimum of thermal losses, so that this radiation is converted in a high-bandgap photovoltaic layer (e.g., in p-n diamond) very efficiently into electricity. The electric power per weight, compared with existing radionuclide batteries, can then be increased by a factor 10 to 50 or more. If the pressure vessel is made from carbon fiber/epoxy, the power-to-weight ratio is said to be comparable to an air-breathing engine with fuel tanks. The advantage of this design is that precision electrode assemblies are not needed, and most beta particles escape the finely-divided bulk material to contribute to the battery's net power. === Disadvantages === * High price of the radionuclides. * High-pressure (up to 10 MPa or 100 bar) heavy containment vessel. * A failure of containment would release high-pressure jets of finely-divided radioisotopes, forming an effective dirty bomb. The inherent risk of failure is likely to limit this device to space-based applications, where the finely-divided radioisotope source is only removed from a safe transport medium and placed in the high- pressure gas after the device has left Earth orbit. == As a DIY project == As simple betaphotovoltaic nuclear battery can be constructed from readily- available tritium vials (tritium-filled glass tubes coated with a radioluminescent phosphor) and solar cells. One design featuring 14 22.5x3mm tritium vials produced 1.23 microwatts at a maximum powerpoint of 1.6 volts. Another design combined the battery with a capacitor to power a pocket calculator for up to one minute at a time. == See also == *Nuclear battery *Betavoltaic device *Radioisotopic thermoelectric generator *Radioisotope piezoelectric generator *List of battery types ==References== *Polymers, Phosphors, and Voltaics for Radioisotope Microbatteries, by Kenneth E.

It was published in daily newspapers such as Dagbladet, as well as in its own monthly magazine M, until December 2012. Initially published as a guest strip in Pondus magazine, it established its own dedicated magazine near the end of 2006. The strip gained a large fan base in Norway, much due to its quirky humour and numerous pop-cultural references. To this day, reprints are regularly published by Kollektivet ==Synopsis== A surreal, semi-auto-biographical, strip, its events revolve around Mads Eriksen and The Madam, his live-in girlfriend. The Madam is always drawn with asterisks for eyes, because, Eriksen claims, it is impossible to know what is on her mind. In one strip, Eriksen states that The Madam is drawn with asterisks because \\"she mixes pills and alcohol\\". One characteristic of the comic is the unique T-shirts the characters wear for every strip, often containing pop-culture references. ==Allegations of blasphemy== In November 2006, a 94-year-old woman from Selbu brought blasphemy charges against Adresseavisen, a Trondheim-based newspaper that published M, over the content of two strips. In both, Jesus Christ is seen advertising for different products, such as \\"Pilate's crucifixion cream for manly men\\". The woman who pressed charges stated that \\"this has nothing to do with freedom of speech. This is much worse than the Muhammad cartoons.\\" Eriksen responded that M is a strip that pokes fun at all sorts of myths, both old and new. A few days later, Dagbladet published a strip in which Mads wins a boxing match against God on a walkover. No further action was taken, and there has been no censorship in Norway over charges of blasphemy content since Life of Brian was banned from cinemas in 1979. ==Pop-cultural references== M satirising Brokeback Mountain Pop cultural phenomena are frequently cited. Among these are: *Alien—Eriksen gets attacked by an alien that hatched from an expired egg. *Douglas Adams and his The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy science fiction novel and radio show. *Firefly—M refuses to breathe before the cancelled TV-show is brought back on the air. However, the character of Mal is incorrectly referred to as Mel in one strip. *Gremlins—M brings a Mogwai home and wants to feed it after midnight... *Hunter S. Thompson—Following the demise of Eriksen's coffee pot, it was blown out of a cannon, while Eriksen was wearing a T-shirt that read gonzo, mimicking Hunter S. Thompson's burial. *Linkin Park and Fred Durst— He has, both in strips and in a national newspaper interview stated that he would rather have his pubic hairs individually removed than listen to Linkin Park. Eriksen himself looks quite similar to Fred Durst, exploited in some strips *Linux—In one strip, Mads' brother (a computer-oracle) offers advice on how to get rid of trojans, malware, etc., always concluding with \\"install Linux\\". At one point a reader asks which Linux distribution he should use, at which point Mads' brother replies: \\"Gentoo for you, Ubuntu for grandma, HA-HA-HA!!!\\" In a current ongoing series, Mads has gotten rid of windows and tries to install Linux, but gets help from \\"Linux Man\\", A.K.A. his brother. *LOST -There has been one reference to the TV-series LOST *The Lord of the Rings—The Madam is especially fond of Viggo Mortensen and Aragorn. *Marvel Comics—Galactus, antagonist of The Silver Surfer, has appeared in M on some occasions. *The Phantom—seen intimately embracing a member of \\"The Singh Brotherhood\\", The Phantom's arch- enemies, in an M-strip. *Poltergeist—in a story arch of strips, Eriksens dead goldfish comes to haunt his apartment, much in the fashion of Poltergeist. *Pondus and Frode Øverli—In an ongoing \\"strip war\\" the two comics have regularly made friendly stabs at each other. It started with Eriksen doing a strip about Øverli sending text messages to all comics artists in Norway, parodying the style of John Arne Riise. Øverli retorted with an attack on M, and everything escalated from there. *Stephen King's The Shining *The Simpsons—There has been several The Simpsons references in the comic. *The Silence of the Lambs—In one strip Mads dresses up like the villain Jame Gumb. *Star Wars—Mads Eriksen is a big fan of the movie series, and the strip frequently makes references, some so specific that getting the joke is restricted to extreme fans. Only satisfied with the original trilogy, the strip's slogan is \\"Mye morsommere enn Jar-Jar\\" (a lot funnier than Jar-Jar). *The Transformers—referenced several times *Twin Peaks—Eriksen once uses the voice recording feature on his mobile phone to record a message to \\"Diane\\" in exactly the same fashion as Agent Cooper and his tape recorder in Twin Peaks. *Wikipedia—A door-to-door salesman attempts to sell Mads an encyclopedia, something which causes Mads to go into a laughing fit. The Madam remarks \\"What are we? The Flintstones\\", commenting that encyclopedias in books are obsolete. Throughout the strip, Mads is wearing a T-shirt with a symbol resembling the Wikipedia logo. *Windows Vista—Mads' brother reviews Vista, beginning by making farting sounds with his mouth, continuing on to pulling his T-shirt over his head whilst still making farting sounds. *World of Warcraft—Mads' friend Øyvind is once seen with a shirt saying \\"Loot Ninja\\", a term used in the online-game. *Yuggoth—Eriksen finds a homeless creature and takes it home. The creature turns out to be Cthulhu from H. P. Lovecraft's The Call of Cthulhu. At one point Eriksen says \\"Cthulhu Fhtagn\\"—\\"Cthulhu Dreams\\"—while the creature is napping in his living room. *David Hasselhoff—David Hasselhoff save's M from a monster clown doll after M dresses in women's clothing and a blond wig and begins to scream. David Hasselhoff hears the screams from a beach and say \\"that's a blond girl scream!\\" and comes to M's rescue; fighting off the monster clown doll. *Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes-The Madam reads the latest gossip about the (then) couple, and Eriksen pretends he wants to write it down in an imaginary book where he collect \\"all the important news\\" about the couple, only to discover that he's filled-up the \\"book\\", and therefore must hurry to the store and buy a new one. ==Sources== * M albums M book, M magazine Schibsted ;Footnotes ==External links== Category:Comics characters introduced in 2004 Category:Norwegian comic strips Category:Gag-a-day comics Category:Autobiographical comics Category:Satirical comics Category:2004 comics debuts Category:Fictional Norwegian people Category:Norwegian comics characters Category:2004 establishments in Norway ","title":"M (comic strip)"},{"id":"3228815","text":"Georgina, Lady Kennard (née Wernher; 17 October 1919 – 28 April 2011) was a member of the British aristocracy who has been described as \\"one of the best connected women in the country\\" and \\"a distant cousin of the Queen and one of her closest friends\\".Richard Allen, Confidante who lived next door, London Evening Standard, 1 May 2002.

The freeway has its southern terminus at US 3 and its northern terminus in downtown Lowell, where it feeds into city streets shortly after an interchange with Route 3A. This alignment, nearly parallel to Massachusetts Route 110, provides much of Lowell with a direct expressway route to the Boston area to the South, and convenient (but slightly roundabout) expressway access to Lowell's eastern and western suburbs by way of Route 3 and 495. ==History== Built in the early 1960s and opened on October 24, 1962, the Lowell Connector is located along the re-channelled River Meadow (or Hales) Brook. This alignment minimally affected existing neighborhoods, unlike many urban expressways in the region. Plans to extend the Connector through the city's Back Central neighborhood, up to and along the Concord River, then onward to Lowell's main street, Merrimack Street, were drawn out, but abandoned after they were decided to be too disruptive to one of the oldest parts of the city. This left the highway terminating abruptly at a residential section of Gorham Street. Another plan circa 1968 had the connector connecting to the planned route of Massachusetts Route 213 in Dracut.http://www.bostonroads.com/history/1968-map_outside-128/ The Connector was officially named for the American Legion on May 20, 1963, a few months after opening; however, signs reflecting this were not posted until November 16, 2010. Since 1976, the highway has shared its name with the student newspaper at UMass Lowell. http://umlconnector.com/about/ ===I-495 Business Spur=== 75px In the mid 1960s, the Connector was designated as Interstate 495 Business Spur. However, there are no records indicating that this designation was ever approved by either the Bureau of Public Roads (now FHWA) or the American Association of State Highway Officials (now AASHTO). Further, the Business I-495 designation was never posted on any signs for the Lowell Connector exit on I-495, US 3, or on any signs on the Connector mainline itself (verified by a comprehensive review of MassDPW signing plans for I-495, US 3, and the Lowell Connector from the late 1950s to the presentper conservation with Steve Timmins, MassDOT Highway Signing Engineer). However, such signs were included on official maps and were physically posted on local streets intersecting the Connector. A lone shield remained for Business Spur I-495 along Plain Street (exit 4) for the Lowell Connector, but was taken down by 2008.https://www.aaroads.com/guides/lowell-connector/ ===Crashes=== Proposed Lowell Connector Extension - Massachusetts Department of Public Works, 1968 The infamous abrupt ending of the Lowell Connector at Gorham Street (exit 5C) with warning signs The Lowell Connector was recently ranked the most dangerous highway in Massachusetts. Particularly, the measurement is crashes per three miles (5 km) of road—the Connector is three miles (5 km) long. The Connector has many serious design flaws. Until a man drag-racing in November 2005 took the life of a pregnant woman, there were few median strip guard rails. As in this particular crash, a car driving at excessive speed (the posted speed limit is 55) could easily lose control going over one of the poorly paved and steeply-graded underpass bridges. The car would cross into the narrow median, and due to the purposely uneven height difference between the north and southbound lanes, become airborne, landing in (or in this case on) oncoming traffic. Additionally, the Connector has an extremely large number of on and off ramps, and many are very short, sharp, and steep. The weaving situation that exists when the Connector merges or splits Route 3 and 495, within a short distance of the Industrial Avenue exit (exit 3), is particularly notorious, as drivers must weave through three lanes of traffic within just a few car lengths. The Lowell Connector is probably best known for the abrupt and downhill termination onto Gorham Street (exit 5C). A large number of cars have overshot the end of the freeway and crashed into the brick wall of a residential property across the street. Recently, in addition to multiple flashing warning signs giving the exact distance to the end of the road, the terminus now features two flashing (strobe) stoplights, and a metal railing across the intersection protecting the property immediate opposite to the termination. Incidentally, Lowell has one of the lowest incidences of seatbelt use in the Commonwealth. ==Exit list== All interchanges were to be renumbered to milepost-based numbers under a project scheduled to start in 2016, however this project was indefinitely postponed by MassDOT until on November 18, 2019, MassDOT announced that this route will not be changing the exit numbers. ==References== ==External links== Category:Freeways in the United States Category:Interstate 95 Category:Roads in Massachusetts Category:Transportation in Lowell, Massachusetts Category:Transportation in Middlesex County, Massachusetts ","title":"Lowell Connector"},{"id":"3228829","text":"Noise for Music's Sake is a double-disc compilation by British band Napalm Death.

It has since become one of the largest entertainment centres in the Costa del Sol, with 5 million annual visitors, and is popular with international celebrities. Developed around a coastal village in the Mediterranean architectural style, Puerto Banús contains high-end shopping malls, restaurants and bars around the marina. ==History== The architect Noldi Schreck, who participated in the design and construction of Beverly Hills, was visited in 1966 by Prince Alfonso de Hohenlohe to ask him to work on the Hotel Marbella Club. Schreck's first job was to meet José Banús (a close friend of Francisco Franco), and convince him that Puerto Banús was not a suitable place to build huge skyscrapers that would house thousands of wealthy families. He proposed a sophisticated Andalusian village and marina, the first port made by a single architect. José Banús became the largest developer of residential tourism complexes on the Costa del Sol. The port took his name and he became famous with the epithet \\"the regime’s builder.\\" Beach of Puerto Banús The lavish opening of the complex in May 1970 was attended by, amongst others, the Aga Khan, film director Roman Polanski, Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, Dr. Christiaan Barnard (pioneer of the heart transplant), and Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco. A young Julio Iglesias was hired to sing for the guests for the sum of 125,000 pesetas. Three hundred waiters from Seville served 22 kilos of beluga caviar to 1700 guests. In 2011, it was reported that one of the largest-scale developments in Marbella's history was to take place with a 400 million euro investment into La Bajadilla, east of Marbella, by Qatari Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani which included a quay for cruise liners, a five- star hotel on the marina, as well as bars, restaurants, shops and supermarkets to compete with Puerto Banús. ==Geography and climate== Map showing Puerto Banús in relation to Marbella.

Visitors to the port tend to be mostly tourists from northern Europe (especially United Kingdom) and Arabs (especially Kuwait and Saudi Arabia), along with Spanish tourists. The focal point of Puerto Banús is the marina. It has berths for 915 boats, including those of the King of Saudi Arabia and several of the world's wealthiest individuals. Behind the harbour lie streets filled with bars, boutiques and nightclubs. The marina has slips for boats and ships from . Its surface area is , and its depth ranges from within the marina, with at its entrance. There is a beach on each side of the marina where boats can be hired. left ===Transport=== From Málaga airport, transport options include car rental, taxi, or bus. The main road A-7 also known as the Autovia del Mediterraneo on its way to Puerto Banus has the toll road or the non toll road which has views from the Costa. ===Shopping=== Shops Its streets are lined with expensive luxury boutiques like Christian Dior, Gucci, Bvlgari, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Elisabetta Franchi and others. One stretch is known as \\"The Golden Mile\\". Apart from the chain of restaurants, boutiques, in the heart of the Antonio Banderas Square is one of the largest El Corte Ingles department stores in Spain, including the up-scale hypermarket, Hipercor. The Boulevard de la Fama de Puerto Banús was created to pay tribute to individuals who have promoted Marbella nationally or internationally through their professional work. Dalí's Rhinoceros (weight 3.6 tonnes) ==Culture== A three- ton statue of a rhinoceros by Salvador Dalí was placed in Puerto Banús in 2004. Officially known as Rinoceronte vestido con puntillas (\\"Rhinoceros dressed in lace\\"), Dalí created the sculpture in 1956 following the filming of his surrealist movie La aventura prodigiosa de la encajera y el rinoceronte (\\"The prodigious adventure of the lacemaker and the rhinoceros\\") in 1954. Another impressive statue sculpted in bronze and copper by the Georgian sculptor Zurab Tsereteli is that of \\"La Victoria\\", which stands tall at height over a granite pedestal. Unveiled in 1994, it was a gift from the Mayor of Moscow. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Buildings and structures in Marbella Category:Coasts of Spain Category:Tourist attractions in Andalusia ","title":"Puerto Banús"},{"id":"3228865","text":"Ujjain district is a district of Madhya Pradesh state in central India.

Forebears had run the Jungsche Apotheke, still owned by the family, where the writer Theodor Fontane, who trained as a pharmacist, once worked. Committed to the Huguenot tradition, the family was French Reformed. Lejeune-Jung's mother, however, a Catholic Rhinelander, had her children baptized in the Catholic Church, thereby starting the development of a Catholic twig in an otherwise Protestant family tree. As a captain in the British merchant marine, Paul's father was for years at sea, until after being stationed in Hamburg and Cologne, where his son Paul was born, he settled down in Rathenow an der Havel, where he died in 1889. Paul Lejeune-Jung completed the requirements for his secondary school certificate (Mittlere Reife), and following his mother's wishes, he then went to a humanistic Gymnasium, the Theodorianum in Paderborn, a town with a strong Catholic character. This transfer meant for Lejeune-Jung three years of Greek, and he needed to do some considerable catching-up in Latin. In 1901 came the Abitur, and thereafter the beginning of Lejeune-Jung's studies in theology, with a view to becoming a Catholic priest. After a few semesters, however, he changed his mind and his specialization, and chose instead to go to the University of Bonn to devote himself to studying philosophy and history. In the latter discipline, Lejeune-Jung earned, under the mediaevalist Alois Schulte, a doctorate in philosophy whose theme was \\"Walther von Palearia, Chancellor of the Norman-Hohenstaufen Empire\\". ==Professional career== Lejeune-Jung broadened his understanding of scientific principles as he was busying himself with studies in economics and economic history at the Humboldt University in Berlin. The year 1907 marked the beginning of his practice- oriented career. Until 1909, he worked as an economic assistant in the Imperial Colonial Office (Reichskolonialamt) and in the German Colonial Company (Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft) so that he could transfer to the pulp and paper industry in 1910, where he met with professional success at Feldmühle AG. In 1913, Lejeune-Jung wed Hedwig Foltmann, a salesman's daughter from Breslau (nowadays Wrocław, Poland). They would have three daughters and five sons. After Lejeune-Jung worked in the wartime raw materials department, wool unit, at the Prussian War Ministry, he found his definitive professional niche as managing director of the Association of German Pulp Makers (Verein Deutscher Zellstofffabrikanten). This was also the starting point for his later political career. ==Political career== Early on, Lejeune-Jung had connections with the German National People's Party (DNVP), for whom he was elected in 1924 as the only Catholic member of the Reichstag from Middle Silesia, representing the electoral district of Breslau. In the November election that same year, he was reëlected, and in the years that followed, he was member and chairman of the trade policy board, taking part in the International Parliamentary Conferences in London (1926), Rio de Janeiro (1927) and Berlin (1929). An undated written record connected with a memorandum whose author was Lejeune-Jung bears witness to the beginning of the 1920s in Germany. In it, the proposed founding of the Imperial Board of Catholics in the German National People's Party is communicated to the Fulda Bishops' Conference. Lejeune-Jung thereby showed himself to be a representative of the so-called rightwing Catholics, who were monarchists, quite unlike the republican-oriented Catholic Centre Party. The writers also explicitly distanced themselves from the Centre Party, \\"which denies the outcome of every force of God, and instead declares the disastrous heresy of the people's sovereignty.\\" The rightwing Catholics did not stand alone with their polemic against the Centre Party. Indeed, even within the Centre Party itself by 1919, a dispute had arisen among Catholics as to Catholics' relationship with the republican form of government. His political position as a Reichstag member with fundamental conservative convictions notwithstanding, Lejeune-Jung belonged to the moderate forces within the DNVP, who managed to bring themselves to practise positive coöperation in the Weimar State. Lejeune-Jung belonged to the conservative German Gentlemen's Club (Deutscher Herrenklub). The petition for a referendum against the Young Plan (1929), sought by DNVP chairman Alfred Hugenberg, brought about Lejeune-Jung's – and 11 other members' – departure from the DNVP faction, which meant for him having to give up a secure place on the party list. This secessionist grouping founded on 28 January 1930 the \\"People's Conservative Union\\" (\\"Volkskonservative Vereinigung\\"), and also joined themselves on 23 July with the Westarp Group – who themselves had been barred from the DNVP – to form the \\"Conservative People's Party\\" (\\"Konservative Volkspartei\\"). The new party, however, did not fare well in the September 1930 election, having only four members returned. Lejeune-Jung, who won no seat, temporarily took up management, but then on 11 June 1932, he joined the Centre Party, with whose right wing he had already had ties even before 1920. Chancellor Heinrich Brüning had already named Lejeune-Jung as an expert to the German-French Economic Commission in 1931. In the analysis of German-French economic relationships, which Lejeune-Jung undertook in a chronicle under the title \\"Parisian Impressions, 30 March to 10 April 1930\\", his skill at precise observation and exact political reasoning became apparent. The core of his supranational concept envisaged coöperation among European states in the economic domain on the basis of a German-French understanding. Lejeune-Jung floated the idea for a European market in which such sectors as the potash industry, heavy industry, the automobile industry and the electrical industry would play a central rôle. He had not, however, overlooked the protectionist mindset that French economic leaders and politicians displayed during discussions about concrete measures, which only bore on a customs union limited to agricultural products, anyway. ==Resistance activities== With the rise of the Nazi dictatorship after 30 January 1933, Lejeune-Jung was pushed out, as were so many in the political fringes. He expressed his hostility towards the Nazi régime in a letter to his friend Treviranus: \\"The breach of the constitutional order the Reich will, to the bitter end, hand over to a madman, unless Wehrmacht and lawcourts identify the constitutional breach and overthrow the usurper.\\" In 1941-1942, Lejeune-Jung got his first knowledge of concrete plans for a resistance against the unjust Nazi state. Through the former trade unionist Max Habermann came contact with Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, the former Mayor of Leipzig and head of the civilian resistance. At his behest, Lejeune-Jung drafted a politicoeconomic plan for the time after the dictatorship were successfully overthrown. In a memorandum from early summer 1943, called \\"Basic Reich Law on Reich Economic Easements\\", Lejeune- Jung named Reich ownership of mineral wealth, socialization of key industries, and state monopolies on transport, insurance, and foreign trade as vital bases of the new economic system. At least two meetings took place at Lejeune-Jung's house during 1943, in which important members of the resistance took part. Among them were the aforesaid Max Habermann, Hermann Kaiser, Wilhelm Leuschner and Julius Leber as well as Friedrich-Werner Graf von der Schulenburg, former ambassador to Moscow, and Josef Wirmer. Although Lejeune-Jung's revolutionary politicoeconomic visions did not meet with every resistance member's approval, Goerdeler latched onto him as the future economics minister in his post-Hitler cabinet. ==Arrest, trial, and death== The failure of the 20 July Plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler with a briefcase bomb at the Wolf's Lair in East Prussia, to whose concrete planning, going by statements that he made before the Volksgerichtshof, Lejeune-Jung was not privy, brought all plans for a democratic government in the German Reich to an abrupt end. Like thousands of others who were to a greater or lesser extent involved in the 20 July resistance movement as a whole, Lejeune-Jung became a victim of the Nazi rulers' barbaric revenge operation, which was unparalleled in German history. After being arrested on 11 August 1944, he was brought to the Gestapo prison on Lehrter Straße in Berlin. On 3 September, the Volksgerichtshof chief prosecutor Lautz laid charges of high treason and treason against him. Among the co-accused were Goerdeler, Wirmer and Leuschner, all members of the formerly foreseen new government. In the course of the proceedings on 7 and 8 September, Lejeune-Jung became just as much a victim of Volksgerichtshof President Roland Freisler's infamous handling of trials as many others before and after him. On 8 September 1944, the second day of the trial, the accused Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, Wilhelm Leuschner, Josef Wirmer, Ulrich von Hassel and Paul Lejeune-Jung were sentenced to death by hanging. Together with the aforesaid charges, Leujeune-Jung was also found guilty of defeatism and supporting the enemy. Leujeune-Jung, Wirmer and von Hassel were put to death that same day at Plötzensee Prison in Berlin. Paul Lejeune-Jung went to his death with the words \\"My Jesus, mercy.\\" His family's enquiries brought to light that the bodies had been taken on Hitler's orders to the Wedding Crematorium, whereafter the ashes had been scattered at an unknown location. ==Written works== *Kolonial- und Reichskonferenzen.

It shocked many of its readers because of Freud's suggestion that Moses was actually born into an Egyptian household, rather than being born as a Hebrew slave and merely raised in the Egyptian royal household as a ward (as recounted in the Book of Exodus). It is Freud's final original work and it was completed in the summer of 1939 when Freud was, effectively speaking, already \\"writing from his death-bed.\\"Technically speaking, work on Freud's Outline of Psycho-Analysis continued after his completion of the last portion of his Moses & Monotheism manuscript, but this was just a reiteration and condensation of earlier works. See reference No. 4 below for citation. ==Summary== The book consists of three essays and is an extension of Freud's work on psychoanalytic theory as a means of generating hypotheses about historical events, in combination with his obsessive fascination with Egyptological scholarship and antiquities. Freud hypothesizes that Moses was not Hebrew, but actually born into Ancient Egyptian nobility and was probably a follower of Akhenaten, \\"the world's earliest recorded monotheist.\\"Brier, Bob. \\"Akhenaten, The Heretic Pharaoh.\\" Lecture 21 of Great Courses History of Ancient Egypt. The biblical story of Moses is reinterpreted by Freud in light of new findings at Tel-El-Amarna. Archaeological evidence of the Amarna Heresy, Akhenaten's monotheistic Aten cult, had only been discovered in 1887 and the interpretation of that evidence was still in an early phase.For example, the inventory of the temple fragments was not completed until 1967 and its digital reconstruction is still ongoing. Winfield Smith, .Ray\\"The Akhenaten Temple Project\\" Expedition Magazine 10.1 (1967): n. pag. Expedition Magazine. Penn Museum, 1967 Web. 05 Jan 2020 https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/the-akhenaten-temple-project/ Freud's monograph on the subject, for all the controversy that it ultimately provoked, was one the first popular accounts of these findings. In Freud's retelling of the events, Moses led only his close followers into freedom (during an unstable period in Egyptian history after Akhenaten's death ca. 1350 BCE), that they subsequently killed the Egyptian Moses in rebellion, and still later joined with another monotheistic tribe in Midian who worshipped a volcano god called Yahweh.\\"Jahve\\" according to Freud's transliteration in Moses & Monotheism (see ref 1). Freud supposed that the monotheistic solar god of the Egyptian Moses was fused with Yahweh (the Midianite volcano god), and that the deeds of Moses were ascribed to a Midianite priest who also came to be called Moses. Moses, in other words, is a composite figure, from whose biography the uprising and murder of the original Egyptian Amarna-cult priest has been excised. Freud explains that centuries after the murder of the Egyptian Moses, the rebels regretted their action, thus forming the concept of the Messiah as a hope for the return of Moses as the Saviour of the Israelites. Freud claimed that repressed (or censored) collective guilt stemming from the murder of Moses was passed down through the generations; leading the Jews to neurotic expressions of legalistically religious sentiment to disperse or cope with their inheritance of trauma and guilt. In many respects, the book reiterates the theogony that Freud first argued in Totem and Taboo, as Freud acknowledges in the text of Moses & Monotheism on several occasions. For example, he writes: > “[This] conviction I acquired when I wrote my book on Totem and Taboo > (1912), and it has only become stronger since. From then on, I have never > doubted that religious phenomena are to be understood only on the model of > the neurotic symptoms of the individual, which are so familiar to us, as a > return of long forgotten important happenings in the primeval history of the > human family, that they owe their obsessive character to that very origin > and therefore derive their effect on mankind from the historical truth that > they contain.\\" ==Publication history== Moses and Monotheism was first published in 1939. It appeared in English translation the same year. ==Reception== The mythologist Joseph Campbell wrote that Freud's suggestion that Moses was an Egyptian \\"delivered a shock to many of his admirers\\". According to Campbell, Freud's proposal was widely attacked, \\"both with learning and without.\\" Campbell himself refrained from passing judgment on Freud's views about Moses, although he considered Freud's willingness to publish his work despite its potential offensiveness \\"noble\\". The theologian Rowan Williams concluded that Freud's accounts of the origin of Judaism are \\"painfully absurd\\", and that Freud's explanations are not scientific but rather \\"imaginative frameworks\\". The philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and the psychologist Sonu Shamdasani write that in Moses and Monotheism Freud applied to history \\"the same method of interpretation that he used in the privacy of his office to 'reconstruct' his patients' forgotten and repressed memories.\\" From the point-of-view of scholarly consensus amongst Egyptologists, the book is a provocative novelty containing many solid scholarly citations, many undisputed facts, alongside many tantalizing speculations some of which seem likely but unprovable, while others seem unlikely or indulgent. ==See also== * Akhenaten * Atenism * Goídel Glas * Joseph and His Brothers * Meritaten * Osarseph ==Further reading== * Assmann, Jan (1998).

The group is the project of guitarist , its one constant member, who is head and owner of the Osaka-based Alchemy Records. Other regulars include Jojo's wife Junko and Toshiji Mikawa (also of Incapacitants). The group began at the very end of the 1970s as a performance art-based group whose anarchic shows would often involve destruction of venues and audio equipment, food and garbage being thrown around, and on-stage urination. As the group's lineup changed over time, their focus became less performance-based and more musically based, fine-tuning their sound into a dense wall of noise. ==History== ===Pre- Hijōkaidan=== Hijōkaidan originally began in 1979 in Kyoto as a side project of Rasenkaidan members and . They played an improvised session at a studio with fellow Rasenkaidan member (a.k.a. Idiot) in attendance. Afterwards, Takayama said \\"This is not , it is more like .\\" This Hijōkaidan played live twice and recorded a few studio sessions. Recordings of this line-up were later released as Original Hijōkaidan or Pre-Hijōkaidan. At the end of the year, Zushi left, and Jojo decided to quit all of his musical projects (Hijōkaidan, Rasenkaidan, and Ultra Bidet). Idiot and Zushi briefly continued Rasenkaidan, and Idiot later formed Idiot O'Clock. ===Corroded Marie=== In the spring of 1980, Jojo formed a new group called to play songs in the style of Hawkwind. Initial members were Jojo, (a.k.a. Oka), Katsuhiro Nakajima (a.k.a. Zuke), Masako Shigesugi (a.k.a. Mako), (a.k.a. Ichie), and . Zushi declined to take part. The practice sessions devolved into improvised noise, and Jojo considered disbanding the group, but was convinced otherwise by Oka, Zuke, and Ichiguchi. In June 1980, Corroded Marie was invited to play ACB Hall in Shinjuku, Tokyo at the event , sponsored by the magazine Heaven and arranged by . By mistake, they were billed as Hijōkaidan, Jojo decided to keep the name. After the show Mako left. Disappointed that they didn't play songs or like Hawkwind, Jojo again thought about disbanding the group. He listened to a cassette of the performance repeatedly, and began to consider the possibility of releasing it. In August he met , who had started an independent label called Unbalance Records, and made a deal to release the show. He contacted Zuke and Oka about releasing the show and asked if they wanted to continue the group. Jojo discovered that they were thinking about continuing as a new group without him. On November 3, the regrouped Hijōkaidan played at Sōzōdōjō in Osaka. The show started with a cover of \\"It's a Rainy Day, Sunshine Girl\\" by Faust, before turning into free-form noise. This show is also the beginning of the performance art aspect of Hijōkaidan's live show, with Zuke throwing around takoyaki. The ACB show was released as one side of a split LP called in December 1980 by Unbalance, the other side had tracks by NG and Jurajium. The track was called in honor of their original name. ==Alchemy Records== Alchemy Records is a record label based in Osaka, Japan, specializing in noise / experimental music and psychedelic rock. It is run by Jojo Hiroshige of the noise group Hijokaidan. Alchemy has released albums by Hijokaidan, Balzac, Hanatarash, Masonna, Incapacitants, Borbetomagus, and Merzbow, among many others. Until April 2008, Alchemy also had a record store in Osaka's Amerikamura. ==Discography== ==References== * * * ==External links== *非常階段 at Teichiku Records (in Japanese) * Category:Japanese rock music groups Category:Noise musical groups Category:Musical groups from Kyoto Prefecture ","title":"Hijokaidan"},{"id":"3228886","text":"Hemis National Park (or Hemis High Altitude National Park) is a high altitude national park in the eastern Ladakh Union Territory of the Republic of India.

Hence, dry forests of juniper, Populus - Salix forests, subalpine dry birch - fir are present at lower altitudes. Alpine and steppe trees are predominantly found here. These trees and shrubs are spread across the valley bottoms. Since the upper mountain slopes are moist, this area is characterized by alpine vegetation including Anemone, Gentiana, Thalictrum, Lloydia, Veronica, Delphinum, Carex and Kobresia. The other parts of the park support steppe vegetation which is dominated by Caragana, Artemisia, Stachys, and Ephedra, present along the lower river courses. A study conducted by CP Kala reports 15 rare and endangered medicinal plants growing in the park, which include Acantholimon lycopodiodes, Arnebia euchroma, Artimisia maritima, Bergenia stracheyi, Ephedra gerardiana, Ferula jaeschkeana, and Hyoscyamus niger.Kala, CP 2005.

Negi, Published by Indus Publishing, 2002 (), () ==Environmental issues== Over 1,600 people live inside the park boundaries, mostly pastoralists raising poultry, goats, and sheep. This results in considerable animal-human conflict within the region. Snow leopards prey on livestock, sometimes killing several animals from a single flock in one hunt. This has been attributed to the overgrazing of livestock. Crop damage caused by bharal has also been seen. The Department of Wildlife Protection, Government of Jammu and Kashmir is the custodian of the park. Any activity in the park is prohibited unless special permission is obtained from the Chief Wildlife Warden J&K.; The department has initiated many projects for biodiversity conservation and rural livelihood improvement in Ladakh, including the Hemis National Park, such as: * Project Snow Leopard for Conserving the entire Himalayan biosphere. The project was initiated by the department in 2004 and was formally launched on 20 February 2009. * Ladakh Eco tourism Project * Ladakh Home stays: A program for providing tourists with access to home stays in local villagers' residences (source of additional income). * Nature Guide Training for the educated unemployed youth. * Eco Cafe for the women Help Group to run the cafe and sell the local handicraft products to the tourist. * Creation of a no-grazing zone for domestic livestock * Predator-proofing livestock pens in the area ==Tourism== No metalled or motorable roads traverse the park. The park offers a number of routes for trekking from mid-June to mid-October. The best season for spotting snow leopards, is, however, in late winter. The historic Hemis Monastery is home to the Hemis Festival (Hemis Tsechu) every summer. Lodging is restricted to backcountry camps, villager homestays and accommodation at the monasteries. * Nearest airport: Leh Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport, Leh district about away * Nearest railhead: Kalka, Haryana * Nearest highway: Leh- Manali Highway, and National Highway 1D (Srinagar - Kargil - Leh), both near the northern borders of the park * Nearest town: There are quite a few villages, and gumphas (monasteries) inside the national park * Nearest city: The city of Leh is to the north of the park. ===Ganda La=== Ganda La (also called the Kanda La, ) is a high mountain pass located at around 4980 metres above sea level in Ladakh, south-west of Leh, in the Himalayas in India. It lies within the Hemis National Park. and connects the Markha valley villages to Leh, and is regularly used by local people. The summer pass is open from June, and the winter pass (half kilometre north-west of summer pass) is open from late April. The Markha Valley trek crosses the pass on the section between Rumbak and Skiu villages, which is usually done over 2 days. The other pass on the trek is the Gongmaru La (Kongmaru La). ===Gallery=== Ganda La.jpgThe top of Ganda La Winter Pass on the way to Skiu Sumdo Nala and Mountain range at Hemis National Park.jpgMountain Range in the eastern part of the park Hemis2.pngA terrain map of Hemis National Park and the surrounding trans-Himalayan Ranges Hemis courtyard.JPGCourtyard of the historic Hemis Monastery inside the NP Hemis Monastery Ladakh 1876.jpgHemis monastery in the 1870s StokKangripic.jpgStok Kangri, the highest peak inside the park boundaries ==In culture== The park houses numerous Tibetan gompas and holy chortens within its boundaries. These include the famous 400-year-old Hemis Monastery. Hemis was a destination and via point on the silk routes of Tibet. Over 1,600 people live inside the park presently, with a large number of tourists and pilgrims visiting during the Hemis Tsechu festival. The 400-year-old Hemis Monastery has long been a place of pilgrimage for Tibetan Buddhists. However, in the late 19th and early 20th century, the monastery attracted some attention due to the writings of Nicolas Notovitch, a Russian aristocrat and journalist, who claimed that Jesus had spent the missing years of his life in Tibet and Ladakh, specifically in Hemis. (see Lost years of Jesus) The national park, monastery and the Changthang Wildlife Sanctuary were prominently featured in the award-winning documentary Riding Solo to the Top of the World. ==See also== * Karakorum Wildlife Sanctuary * Changthang Cold Desert Wildlife Sanctuary ==References== ==Bibliography== * Management Plan Hemis High Altitude National Park, Jigmet Takpa IFS and Saleem Ul Haq. *Hemis High Altitude National Park-Government of Jammu and Kashmir, Department of Wildlife Protection, Wildlife Division(LAHDC) Leh-Ladakh * Chettri, Nakul. 2003. * Namgail, T., Fox, J.L. & Bhatnagar, Y.V.

His name is also written as 'Van den Ende', 'Van den Eijnde', 'Van den Eijnden', 'Van den Eynde' etc. At the end of his life he was also known as 'Affinius' (Latinized form of 'Van den Enden'). == Life == Van den Enden, the son of weavers, was baptized in Antwerp on 6 February 1602. He was a pupil at the Augustinian and the Jesuit colleges of that city. In 1619 he entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus, but in 1633 he was dismissed from the order. In the later 1630s he contributed some Neo-Latin poems to devotional works by the Spanish Augustinian Bartholomé de los Rios y Alarcón. In about the same period he also seems to have been active in the Antwerp art trade, in which his brother Martinus van den Enden played an important role, as a publisher of prints by Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck. In 1640 Van den Enden married Clara Maria Vermeeren at Antwerp and in 1641 a first child was born, named after her mother Clara Maria. It is not clear where and when their second daughter Margereta Aldegonis was born. Probably around 1645 the family moved to Amsterdam, where Van den Enden started an art shop in the Nes. Only a few engravings and one pamphlet published by him are known. After the bankruptcy of his art shop, he opened a Latin school on the Singel. His pupils performed several classical plays in the Amsterdamse theatre and also a Neo-Latin play by his own hand, Philedonius (1657). By then the family had expanded: in 1648 the twins Anna and Adriana Clementina were born, in 1650 a son, Jacobus, in 1651 a daughter, Marianna, and in 1654 again a daughter, Maria (Anna, Jacobus and Maria probably died very young). In the late 1650s the famous philosopher Baruch Spinoza and the anatomist Theodor Kerckring were pupils at his school. In the early 1660s some people thought that Van den Enden was an atheist, while others believed that he was a Roman Catholic. In this period, together with Pieter Corneliszoon Plockhoy, he worked on a project for a utopian settlement in New Netherland, more precisely in the area of the present Delaware. Van den Enden's views on this ideal society are found in the Kort Verhael van Nieuw-Nederland (Brief Account of New Netherland, 1662). Some years later, in 1665, another political publication appeared, the Vrye Politijke Stellingen (Free Political Proposals), in which democracy is defended and attention is paid to the social and educational tasks of a state. In that same year, when the Second Anglo- Dutch War had just started, he wrote to Johan de Witt offering to sell him a secret weapon for the navy. Shortly after the marriage of his oldest daughter Clara Maria with Theodor Kerckring (also written as 'Kerckrinck') in 1671, Van den Enden moved to Paris, where he opened another Latin school. There he was visited by Antoine Arnauld and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. He also got involved in a plot against Louis XIV, but the conspirators were caught before they could execute their plans, the establishment of a republic in Normandy. Franciscus van den Enden was condemned to death and on 27 November 1674, after the decapitation of the noble conspirators, he was hanged before the Bastille. == A pioneer of the democratic idea == In his 'Kort Verhael van Nieuw Nederlants Gelegenheit' (1662 - 'a Short Story of a New Dutch Occasion'), Van den Enden gives his views on the political notion of 'Gelijkheidsbeginsels\\" - equality. \\"The state must bring benefits in equal measures to all. The well- being-increasing effect of the state must become apparent independently of a person's abilities, sex, property, and social status. He opposes explicitly that equality comes down to equalization. The laws should aim towards the general benefit, while they give to all in the same manner give space for individuality.\\" (A translation as close as possible to his originally dutch wordings as per Dutch Wikipedia article on Franciscus van den Enden - A pioneer of the democratic thought). In his \\"Vrije Politieke Stellingen\\" (1665- 'some Free Political Theses'), Van den Enden advocates for freedom of speech and the general right to develop. He further develops the idea of popular sovereignty. He is convinced that the people, by the practice of democracy in popular assemblies and concertations, will gain experience and insight. As an example of democratic functioning, he gives the method of such working as used in Holland during the Eighty Years' War against Spain. But he also warns that all officers must be followed with a watchful eye, especially those who excel in eloquence and greed. In a sense, Van den Enden can be considered a forerunner of the French Revolution where the concepts of liberty, equality and fraternity became the yardstick of a new model for society. == Importance == One of the central questions concerning Franciscus van den Enden is whether and in how far he was an influence on the philosophy of Spinoza, a question already raised by Meinsma. In 1990 Marc Bedjai and Wim Klever, independently from each other, established that Van den Enden was the author of two anonymous pamphlets, the Kort Verhael van Nieuw Nederland (Brief Account of New Netherland) and the Vrye Politijke Stellingen (Free Political Proposals). Mainly on the basis of the last work the claim was made, most strongly by Klever, that the whole of Spinozist philosophy had been developed by Van den Enden. The idea of a strong influence on Spinoza was later adopted in the most recent biographies of Spinoza (by Stephen Nadler, and more outspokenly by Margaret Gullan-Whur). However, a thorough analysis of both pamphlets shows that a possible influence was rather limited and the chronology of the sources does not allow it to be determined whether it was the teacher who influenced the pupil or whether it was the other way around. Apart from this question, which due to the fragmentary source material will probably never be answered with certainty, Van den Enden's later writings are of great interest. It is clear, for instance, that together with Johan de la Court, he should be counted among the earliest Dutch-writing and Early-Modern promoters of democracy. His defence of religious toleration, a secular state, public education and less cruel forms of justice situate him within the Early Enlightenment. Moreover, his radical rejection of slavery is unique, even within his circle of Amsterdam freethinkers. Finally, Van den Enden's concern for social problems and his proposals for organized forms of solidarity, presumably influenced by Plockhoy, must be considered original for his time. == Works == *Philedonius (1657) *Kort Verhael van Nieuw Nederland (1662) *Vrye Politijke Stellingen (1665) *Vrije Politijke Stellingen (ed.

Its coining is generally attributed to long-time science fiction fan and author Jack L. Chalker. ==Capitalised meaning== The capitalised form of the term (SMOF) is used jokingly to refer to a clandestine cabal of top science fiction fans who, by their unseen influence, are controlling the actions of fandom. It is the SMOFs who are responsible for the trends and changes in the popularity of particular subgenres, media, or individual authors, films or television series. As such, this use of the term is a light-hearted conspiracy theory. ==Uncapitalised meaning== The more general, uncapitalised, form of the term (smof) is an honorific bestowed upon the fans who actually do the organisational work behind much of fandom or are stalwart members of the fannish community. This includes fans who are regarded highly by others for their work in running conventions, fanzines, and fan funds, and who work (for the most part) on an entirely voluntary basis for the good of fandom in general, as well as those whose standing is high within the fannish community by dint of their long participation in it. The capitalization distinction is not rigidly observed; it is not unusual to capitalize the term even when it is being used in the more general sense, although the reverse (uncapitalized usage connoting the conspiracy humor) is rare. ==Verb meaning== \\"SMOFing\\" (or \\"smoffing\\") is used as a verb to refer to discussing the details or personalities involved in running a convention; when organizers talk amongst themselves about something related to fandom, they are SMOFing. Although by its nature informal, the term smof is now used by several science fiction convention management cooperative associations (some incorporated as non- profits, others simply ad hoc). For example, there is a smofs mailing list for Worldcon management, a yearly convention for SF con managers named SMOFcon, and a defunct website and series of meetings for convention runners in the Baltimore-Washington area of the USA run by an organization called BWSMOF. ==History== The earliest known citation is from the New York Times, in an issue published on September 6, 1971. The term appears in the 1978 edition of Wilson Tucker's Neo-Fan's Guide to Science Fiction Fandom.

The flag is so called as a broad pennant because its dimensions are roughly 2:3. Starting in 1826, a Royal Navy commodore would fly one of two broad pennants depending on whether he had a captain for his ship (First Class Commodore), or also had to command it himself (Second Class). This difference was shown by a ball added to the pennant of the Second Class rank holder, as shown above. In 1958, the rank of First Class Commodore was terminated, after which only the red and white broad pennant with a ball was used by the Royal Navy.United Kingdom: Royal Navy rank flags The U.S. Navy will also refer to this flag as a Commodore's \\"command pennant.\\" In the U.S. Navy, the blue and white pennant will contain either numbers or letters indicating the command designation or name. For example, the pennant for the Commodore commanding Destroyer Squadron 25 (DESRON 25) will have the numeral \\"25\\" on the field of their command pennant. Likewise, the Commodore commanding Strike Fighter Wing Atlantic will have the letters \\"SFWL\\" or \\"CSFWL\\" on their pennant. In U.S. Naval Aviation, this pennant is also used by the commander of a carrier air wing. The broad command pennant is used in all respects the same as an admiral's flag. When embarked aboard a warship as the senior officer, it is broken aboard that commodore's flagship at the same points of hoist as an admiral's flag. It is also carried at the bow of a boat in which they are embarked, emblazoned on their social letterhead, displayed on a staff in his or her office ashore, and, if they should die in command, half-masted aboard their flagship and carried before their casket in the funeral ceremony. Also in the U.S. Navy, a red and white Burgee command pennant, similar to but smaller in the size than the Commodore's command pennant, has been flown by subordinate commanding officers, typically officers in the rank of Commander, of smaller aircraft units such as aviation squadrons or similar precedence units such as SEAL Teams or Naval Mobile Construction Battalions. For commanding officers of commissioned warships, the ship's commissioning pennant is considered to carry the symbolism of that vessel's commanding officer.McMillan, Joe (2001). \\"Commissioning pennant\\".

Nibley 1873 (age 24) Nibley was born in Hunterfield, Midlothian, Scotland to James Nibley and Jean Wilson. In 1855, his family moved to the United States to join with the main body of Latter-day Saints. They spent some time living in Rhode Island. In 1860, they moved to the Utah Territory. The family was sent north to settle in Cache Valley, and eventually settled in Wellsville. As an adult, Nibley moved to Brigham City, Utah, where he worked for Morris Rosenbaum (a Jewish convert to Mormonism) Jenson, Andrew. LDS Biographical Encyclopedia, Vol. 4, p. 766 and later became a partner in the store where he worked. It was there he met Rebecca Neibar (who was the sister of one of Rosenbaum's wives) and was married in 1869. Following the 19th century practice of plural marriage, Nibley married Ellen Ricks in 1880 and Julia Budge in 1885. ==Business ventures== In 1879 to 1885, Nibley managed a lumber company that was part of the LDS Church's United Order program. He then joined with David Eccles and George Stoddard to form the Oregon Lumber Company in 1889. As one of Nibley's grandsons, Hugh Nibley, related, Charles Nibley used economic tricks, including manipulating the Homestead Act to acquire large swaths of land, then would pay off government agents who investigated.Hugh Nibley, Approaching Zion (The Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Vol 9), p. 469 Nibley was a firm believer in monopolies, believing competition was \\"economic waste\\".Nibley, \\"Facts are Given About the Sugar Industry\\", Salt Lake Tribune, June 25, 1916 He also believed that LDS Church members who didn't support paying higher prices to Mormon businesses (versus lower prices to non-Mormon businesses) were betraying the church. This attitude of loyalty was also supported by Heber J. Grant in the October 1919 General Conference. Nibley also became involved in railroads, insurance, banking, politics, and major agricultural endeavors, eventually becoming a multimillionaire. The sugar beet growing town of Nibley, Oregon was named for him. He was later instrumental in forming the Amalgamated Sugar Company and the Utah and Idaho Sugar Company (later known as U&I; Sugar Co). ==Church service== ===Missions=== Nibley served two missions for the LDS Church. His first mission, from October 1869 to March 1870, was to the eastern United States and was primarily a goodwill mission, trying to counteract the negative press surrounding polygamy in Utah. His second mission, from May 1877 to May 1879, was to England and proved to be influential to later Church history. He traveled with the new mission president, Joseph F. Smith, and while serving in England became good friends with the future Church president. ===Stake Presidency=== After Nibley had moved to Oregon to participate in the lumber business, an LDS stake was organized in the area, and Nibley was called as the first counselor in the stake presidency. He served from June 1901 to December 1907. ===Presiding Bishop=== Nibley was called as the presiding bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in December 1907 by Joseph F. Smith, with whom he had served in England a few decades earlier. It was during Nibley's term as presiding bishop that the LDS Church built the Hotel Utah. \\"Charles W. Nibley was one of the most liberal industrialists of his time. But he had to compromise. Thus to finish the Hotel Utah, it was necessary to borrow $2,000,000, so President Smith sent Brother Nibley to Barney Baruch in New York to raise the money. He succeeded, and President Smith was delighted; but he was also alarmed when he heard the terms: it would all have to be paid back in two years. \\"Charley, what have you done? How in the world will we ever pay it back in that time?\\" Not to worry, they would have the whole thing paid off in two years. How? \\"I'm going to build the largest and finest bar in the West in the basement of the Hotel, and will see that we will pay off every penny of that debt.\\" President Smith went through the ceiling; which was it to be, the Word of Wisdom or fiscal soundness? The dollar won\\" ===First Presidency=== In 1925, he was released as presiding bishop and was asked to be second counselor to Heber J. Grant in the church's First Presidency. He is one of the few individuals to serve in the First Presidency without having been ordained to the priesthood office of apostle. ==Death and legacy== Nibley died of pneumonia in Salt Lake City, Utah;State of Utah Death Certificate he was buried in Logan City Cemetery. Nibley, Utah is named after him. Charles's son Preston became a church leader and author of several Mormon books. Hugh W. Nibley, a Mormon apologist and academic, is Charles's grandson, through his son, Alexander.

Additional distinguishing characteristics include the colour of the iris (which is bright red), and extremely short legs. ==Flora== Three major types of plant communities are found in the Park – grasslands, shrublands and forests. The terrain above 2000m is covered primarily by grasslands. However, there are numerous small patches of forests in hollows and gullies in these areas. The deeper valleys are extensively forested. Shrublands predominate along the bases of the cliffs and interspersed in rocky slab areas. The antibacterial Eupatorium glandulosum is found here. As this is monate forest vegetation many small mosses, lichen are also found here. ==History== Prior to 1971, the area was managed as a game preserve by the Kanan Devan Hills Produce Company. The government of Kerala resumed control in 1971 (Kannan Devan Hill Produce (Resumption of lands) Act, 1971), and declared the Eravikulam-Rajamala Wildlife Sanctuary in 1975 to protect the habitat of the endangered Nilgiri tahr.

He played a role in the founding of the Boy Scouts of Canada. Murray is best known as the husband of Margaret Lally \\"Ma\\" Murray. ==Early life and career== Originally a reporter for the Ottawa Citizen, Murray was schooled informally in politics by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, with whom he rode the streetcar to work every morning. After moving to British Columbia he started a weekly newspaper, The Chinook, from an office in South Vancouver. Murray was active in Liberal Party politics and local society. It was during this period that he hired (and later married) Margaret Lally. Unable to enlist during World War I due to health problems, he folded The Chinook for financial reasons and moved to Anmore (near Port Moody) and worked as a reporter and editor with the Vancouver News-Advertiser (predecessor of the Vancouver Sun). During the Murrays' time in Anmore, they launched Country Life (a magazine for rural women which was popular for many years). The Murray home in Anmore is the village hall, and Ma Murray Days are celebrated each September. In Anmore, the Murrays arranged the funeral of Vancouver's pioneer bartender and longtime volunteer lifeguard Joe Fortes in 1922 with phone calls to their connections in town (including the bishop who had married them). They also promoted the construction and dedication of the Peace Arch and the international peace park at the Blaine border crossing in 1921. A promoter of railways, agriculture, resource exploration in British Columbia's north (and interior) and the potential for trade with China, Murray accepted the Liberal Party nomination for provincial legislature in the wilderness riding of Lillooet and moved the family there in 1933. He and his wife founded the Bridge River-Lillooet News and the Mines Communicator, a satellite publication serving the goldfield towns of the Bridge River country west of Lillooet. They also launched the Howe Sound Tribune in Squamish, and continued to publish Country Life. The Murrays made an official visit to Shanghai at the outbreak of the War in the Pacific, and had to be evacuated during its bombardment by the Japanese. With the banks closed, Margaret fortunately found a Canadian 50-cent piece hidden in her sewing purse to purchase a rickshaw ride to the city's harbour. Evacuation to a waiting American warship was procured, and the MLA was announced as the Premier of British Columbia (apparently a ruse by his wife to assure passage). When they returned to Lillooet, they found the town's rail siding lined with rail cars packed with Japanese-Canadian evacuees from the coast, many of whom would remain in the area for the duration of the war. The Murrays launched a fundraising campaign for Chinese relief, raising $20,000 from local Chinese merchants. During their absence the Murrays left the newspaper business in the hands of their young-adult children Dan and Georgina, who moved the Howe Sound Tribune to Williams Lake in violation of wartime newsprint-rationing rules (where it remains as the Williams Lake Tribune). Murray promoted the economic potential of his riding, paying for junkets for businessmen and investors to the Bridge River Country goldfields. He and Margaret were also enthusiastic promoters about the region's history, and headed a campaign to erect a \\"Mile O Cairn\\" in Lillooet to commemorate the original Cariboo Wagon Road (which began at the head of the town's main street). Murray lobbied for road construction to support development of the Blue Creek gold find in the Shulaps Range near Big Dog Mountain, which would have seen a highway routed to Gold Bridge and Bralorne via the north end of the range (instead of the Bridge River Canyon, where Highway 40 connects. The Murrays' support for striking miners at Bralorne-Pioneer Mine sparked an advertising boycott by the mine company and other businesses, forcing the closure of the Mines Communicator and the sale of the Bridge River-Lillooet News. With most of his supporters (the miners) away at war Murray lost the 1941 election, receiving fewer than 100 votes. The Murrays, now pariahs in the region and with George losing his seat in the provincial legislature, moved to the boom town of Fort St. John in the province's northeast Peace River Country and founded the Alaska Highway News. In 1945 Murray ran unsuccessfully in the Lillooet riding (commuting from Fort St. John for the campaign) under the Liberal Progressive banner, since he had refused to join the Liberal- Conservative coalition of John Hart. George run successfully for the federal Liberals in the Cariboo riding in the 1949 general election. Margaret ran for the provincial legislature as a Socred without telling George. Although she lost, her campaign and her support for W.A.C. Bennett ruined George's political career and cemented her reputation for eccentricity. George lost his federal seat in 1953 to a Social Credit candidate in the wake of the embarrassment and retired from politics, returning to Lillooet (where the family regained the Bridge River-Lillooet News, which Margaret continued to edit and publish after his death in 1961. ==Political career== ===Election results=== ====1933==== Lillooet riding * Carson, Ernest Crawford (NPIG): 705 votes, 33.51% * Murray, George Matheson (Lib.): 927, 44.06% * Smith, John Morrison (CCF): 472, 22.43% * Rejected ballots: 96 * Total votes: 2,104 ====1937==== Lillooet riding * Armstrong, Robert Purvis (CCF): 855, 28.92% * Carson, Ernest Crawford (Cons.): 925, 31.29% * Murray, George Matheson (Lib.): 1,176, 39.78% * Rejected ballots: 57 * Total votes: 2,956 ====1941==== Lillooet riding * Archibald, Harry Grenfell (CCF): 841, 31.75% * Carson, Ernest Crawford (Cons.): 1,017, 38.39% * Murray, George Matheson (Lib.): 791, 29.86% * Rejected ballots: 29 * Total votes: 2,649 ====1945==== Lillooet riding * Carson, Ernest Crawford (Coal.): 1,143, 51.42% *Jacobsen, John Fossmark (SCA): 196, 8.82% *Murray, George Matheson (Pro.

Todd has Ukrainian origin. ==Playing career== Fedoruk spent his first seven professional seasons in the Philadelphia Flyers organization after being drafted 164th overall in 1997. He made his NHL debut during the 2000–01 season and played in 220 games over four seasons with the club, recording at least 100 penalty minutes in each season. He played with the American Hockey League (AHL)'s Philadelphia Phantoms during the 2004–05 NHL lockout and took part in that team's run to the Calder Cup championship. Shortly after the lockout ended, Fedoruk was traded to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in exchange for a 2005 second-round draft pick (Pierre-Olivier Pelletier) on July 29, 2005. The 2005–06 season saw Fedoruk post career highs in games played (76), assists (19), points (23) and penalty minutes (174) as a member of the Ducks. The Flyers re-acquired Fedoruk on November 13, 2006, for a fourth-round draft pick. Fedoruk, who is known for his skills as an enforcer, had titanium plates permanently embedded into his face to repair injuries caused in a fight with Minnesota Wild enforcer Derek Boogaard during the 2006–07 NHL season. Later that season, on March 21, 2007, Fedoruk was once again injured, in a fight against New York Rangers enforcer Colton Orr—Fedoruk was knocked unconscious and had to be carried off the ice on a stretcher. On July 9, 2007, Fedoruk signed a one-year contract with the Dallas Stars. In at start of the 2007–08 season, Fedoruk struggled to make the lineup and played only a handful of games before he was demoted to the club's AHL affiliate, the Iowa Stars, on November 20, 2007. Before playing a game with Iowa, Fedoruk was claimed off waivers by the Minnesota Wild on November 22, 2007. Fedoruk played out the season with the Wild and scored his first career playoff goal during the Wild's first round defeat to the Colorado Avalanche. Fedoruk signed a three-year contract with the Phoenix Coyotes on July 1, 2008. In the 2008–09 season, he played in 72 games with the Coyotes, scoring 13 points. On July 21, 2009, Fedoruk was traded (alongside David Hale) to the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for Radim Vrbata. On August 4, 2011, the Vancouver Canucks signed Fedoruk on a try-out contract to attend training camp. After the conclusion of training camp and in the midst of the pre-season on October 1, 2011, Fedoruk was released by the Canucks without a contract offer, effectively ending his professional career. ==Facial injuries== On November 11, 2003, Fedoruk was involved in a scrap with New York Islanders defenseman Eric Cairns. Fedoruk was deemed to have the better of the exchange at the time. but it was not readily apparent that a right from Cairns had broken Fedoruk's orbital bone. Fedoruk underwent surgery, and was back on the ice not long after. On October 24, 2006, while Fedoruk was playing with the Anaheim Ducks, he challenged Minnesota Wild enforcer Derek Boogaard to a fight. Boogaard landed a brutal punch on Fedoruk that knocked him to the ice and shattered his cheek bone. Fedoruk left the ice immediately after the fight, but was in visible distress, and would not return for the rest of the night. Afterward, Fedoruk underwent considerable surgery to reconstruct the side of his face. Fedoruk was then traded from Anaheim to his former club, the Philadelphia Flyers. While playing for the Flyers, Fedoruk was involved in another scrap, this time with New York Rangers enforcer Colton Orr. During this fight, Fedoruk was knocked out due to a wild right from Orr. He lay on the ice, unable to move for around four minutes before being put on a stretcher. However, Fedoruk sustained no additional serious injuries due to this fight. ==Post-retirement== On November 9, 2011, Fedoruk was named assistant coach of the Flyers' ECHL affiliate, the Trenton Titans, for which he had played 18 games in 1999–2000 as a Flyers prospect. He served in the role for two seasons until 2013. Fedoruk has been a resident of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, with his wife and three children. ==Career statistics== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

It was designated on 16 September 1998 and obtained the status of a Ramsar site on 19 August 2002. The area is also been designated as second Ramsar site of the State after the Chilika Lake. It is surrounded by Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary, which spread over . Gahirmatha Beach and Marine Sanctuary are to the east, separating swamp region and mangroves from the Bay of Bengal. The national park and wildlife sanctuary is inundated by the rivers Brahmani, Baitarani, Dhamra, Pathsala. It hosts many mangrove species, and is the second largest mangrove ecosystem in India. The national park is home to Saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), Indian python, king cobra, black ibis, darters and many other species of flora and fauna. ==Wildlife== Habalikhati Beach at Bhitarkanika A pathway inside the park Mangroves of Bhitarkanika National Park commonly known as Hental Bana Bhitarkanika National Park === Flora === Mangroves are salt tolerant, complex and dynamic eco-systems that occur in tropical and subtropical inter-tidal regions. Bhitarkanika is one such location of rich, lush green vibrant eco- system lying in the estuarine region of Brahmani- Baitarani in the North- Eastern corner of Kendrapara district of Odisha. The area is intersected by a network of creeks with Bay of Bengal on the East. The alley between the meandering creeks and rivers, houses the second largest viable mangrove eco- system of India. Its 672 km² of mangrove forest and wetland provides home to well over 215 species of birds including winter migrants from central-Asia and Europe. Giant salt water crocodiles and a variety of other wildlife inhabit this eco-system which is one of Asia's most spectacular wildlife sanctuaries. An area of 145 km² has been notified as Bhitarkanika National Park vide Notification No.19686/F in September 1998 by the government of Odisha. It has much significance with regard to ecological, geomorphological and biological background which includes mangrove forests, rivers, creeks, estuaries, back water, accreted land and mud flats. Bhitarkanika National Park is the core area of Bhitarkanika Sanctuary. Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary was declared vide notification No.6958/FF AH on 22 April 1975 over an area of 672 km². The Sanctuary comprising mangrove forests meandering rivers, innumerable criss- crossed tidal inundated creeks provide last refuge to the already endangered salt water crocodile (Crocodilus porosus). The sanctuary is rich in avifauna, mammalian and reptilians and provide habitat for king cobra, Indian python and Asian water monitor. Many water birds visit Bagagahan heronry, which is an area of approximately 4 ha within the Bhitarkanika Forest Block near Suajore creek from the month of June to October. Most of the birds are Asian open bill, egrets, black ibis, cormorants, and darters. Mangrove species, casuarinas, and grasses like the indigo bush. === Fauna === Spotted deer at Bhitarkanika National Park The park is home to the saltwater crocodile, Indian python, black ibis, wild boar, rhesus monkey, chital, darter, cobra, monitor lizard. Olive ridley turtles nest on Gahirmatha and other nearby beaches. Bhitarkanika has one of the largest populations of endangered saltwater crocodile in India and is globally unique in that, 10% of the adults exceed 6 m length. Nearly 1671 saltwater crocodiles inhabit the rivers and creeks. Crocodiles in Bhitarakanika] Around 3,000 saltwater crocodiles were born during 2014 annual breeding and nesting season. In 2006, Guinness World Records accepted claims of a , male saltwater crocodile living within Bhitarkanika National Park. Due to the difficulty of trapping and measuring a large living crocodile, the accuracy of these dimensions is yet to be verified. These observations and estimations have been made by park officials over the course of ten years, from 2006 to 2016, however, regardless of the skill of the observers it cannot be compared to a verified tape measurement, especially considering the uncertainty inherent in visual size estimation in the wild.Bayliss, P. (1987). Survey methods and monitoring within crocodile management programmes. Surrey Beatty & Sons, Chipping Norton, pages 157–175 According to the park report in 2006, there were 203 adults, of which 16 measured over ; 5 of these , and 3 over , as well as the preserved skeleton of a specimen which died one year earlier. A significant figure, since individuals over are considered rare, making the Bhitarkanika Park a suitable habitat for large individuals. The most recently published official park report shows an increase of adult crocodiles to 308 individuals, as well as a steady increase over the years. In future, if conservation efforts pay off, these large individuals could be more common.Grigg, G., & Kirshner, D. (2015). Biology and Evolution of Crocodylians. CSIRO PUBLISHING. As per the 2014 survey of mammals, first of its kind to be undertaken in the forest and wetland sites of the park; 1,872 spotted deers, 1,213 numbers of wild boars have made the forest areas their home. The census breakup of other mammals is monkeys - 1,522, jackals - 305, common langur - 39, otter - 38, sambar deer - 17, jungle cat - 11, fox - 10, Mongoose - 7, wolf- 7, fishing cats - 3, hyena - 12, according to the survey data. Avifauna includes 320 species including eight kingfisher species. Birds such as Asian open bill, cormorants, darters, black ibis, egrets, are frequently seen in the park. Every year close to 120,000 winter visitors from abroad for wintering and 80,000 resident birds from different parts of India arrive for nesting during the monsoon season. ==Attractions== It is a very good place to sight the giant Salt Water Crocodile, some growing to 23 feet in length, along with other reptiles like the Water Monitor Lizard and the King Cobra. Spotted deers and wild boars are abundant in the park and can be spotted at all the major locations. Eight varieties of Kingfishers are found here and can be spotted along the many creeks and riverines within the park. The boat ride from Khola to Dangmal or vice versa is highly recommended. Khola is one of the gateways into the park. This is along an artificial creek and it passes through dense mangrove forest providing a glimpse into the estuarine ecosystem and its wealth of fauna. The best time to travel through this creek is early morning or before sunset. Bhitarkanika has a very rich historical and cultural past. It used to be the hunting grounds of the erstwhile King of Kanika . The hunting towers and artificial watering holes can be seen at many places including Bhitarkanika trail and at Dangmal. It is also the home of medieval Hindu temples which can be found dotted throughout the sanctuary. But the major attraction remains the wildlife wealth. ==References== == External links == Category:National parks in Odisha Category:Protected areas established in 1975 ","title":"Bhitarkanika National Park"},{"id":"3229021","text":"Serial Girlfriend is the sixth solo album by former Headcoatee Holly Golightly.

Its vegetation consists of subtropical, tropical deciduous trees and pitcher plant. Species recorded include Indian elephant, chital deer, wild water buffalo, red panda, Bengal tiger, and marbled cat. The rivers and lakes in the wildlife reserve are home to various species of birds. == Balpakram myths == thumb Balpakram has many mysterious and unnatural phenomena that cannot be satisfactorily explained by modern science and logic. A Schima wallichii tree has a depression on its trunk. Local people believe that it was caused by spirits that take rest here on their way to their abode of the dead and tether animals killed on their funeral.

Sharma was coached by Desh Prem Azad, a Dronacharya Award winner, who was also the mentor of Kapil Dev. ==Domestic career== He made his first class debut for Haryana at the age of 16 and appeared in One Day Internationals a year later. ==International career== ===Early career=== Making his first appearance in Tests against Pakistan at Lahore in 1984, he bowled Mohsin Khan with his fifth ball – becoming the third Indian to take a wicket in his first over in Test cricket. He took fourteen wickets in the three Tests in Sri Lanka in 1985. Later that season in Australia, with India needing a win in the last match of the league to qualify for the final of the World Series Cup. Sharma was an important member of the Indian team that defeated England 2–0 in 1986. He took sixteen wickets in the two Tests that he played. He took 10 wickets at Birmingham, including a career best 6 for 58 in the second innings. It remains the only 10 wicket haul by an Indian in England. He also is one of the few Indian pacers, like his mentor Kapil Dev, to take a 5 wicket haul in his 32 over spell to end with 5-64 and also have his name permanently etched in the Hall of Fame board at the Lords Cricket Ground. Though only twenty at this time, he picked up frequent injuries which restricted his career. When available, he was the first choice as the opening bowler with Kapil Dev for the next three years. For his ability to get useful runs down the order that too at quick rate, Chetan was seen as a natural successor to Kapil Dev in the all-rounder category. By the early nineties, his bowling dropped in pace and its sharpness and his strike rate had dropped considerably. ===1987 World Cup=== In the Reliance World Cup in 1987, Sharma took the first hat-trick in the history of tournament when he clean bowled Ken Rutherford, Ian Smith and Ewen Chatfield of New Zealand off consecutive balls. ===Post World Cup=== He played the most noted innings of his career against England in the Nehru Cup in 1989. Sent in at No.3 with India facing a target of 256, he scored a 101* in 96 balls, completing his hundred with the match-winning run. He made another important contribution in India's win against Australia in the next match, sharing an unfinished partnership of 40 runs with Manoj Prabhakar and ending the match with a six. But his bowling had waned considerably and he was excluded from the tour of Pakistan a few weeks later. ===Late career=== Sharma received few opportunities thereafter. In one of his last international appearances, against New Zealand in a three nations tournament in 1994 he ended up with figures of 1–0–23–0 after being hit for five fours off consecutive balls by Stephen Fleming. He moved from Haryana to Bengal in 1993 and stayed there till the end of his career in 1996. Sharma is also infamously remembered for bowling the last over in the final of the Austral-Asia cup in Sharjah in 1986. With Pakistan needing four runs off the last ball to win, he bowled a low full toss outside the leg stump, which was hit for six by Javed Miandad. That defeat started a chain of defeats for Indian cricket team in Sharjah. ==After cricket== After his retirement, Chetan became a cricket commentator. He opened a Fast bowling cricket academy in Panchkula in Haryana in 2004 which closed down in 2009. Chetan is the nephew of the former Indian cricketer Yashpal Sharma. Chetan contested the Lok Sabha (2009) polls from Faridabad on a Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) ticket.https://www.outlookindia.com/elections/loksabha/2009/haryana/faridabad/prithla He came 3rd polling 18.2 percent votes. ==References== * * Christopher Martin- Jenkins, The Complete Who's Who of Test Cricketers Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:India One Day International cricketers Category:One Day International hat-trick takers Category:Cricketers at the 1987 Cricket World Cup Category:India Test cricketers Category:Indian cricketers Category:North Zone cricketers Category:East Zone cricketers Category:Bengal cricketers Category:Haryana cricketers Category:Cricketers from Ludhiana Category:Indian cricket coaches Category:Victoria Sporting Club cricketers Category:Indian cricket commentators Category:M Parkinson's World XI cricketers ","title":"Chetan Sharma"},{"id":"3229052","text":"Emerson James Spartz (born February 17, 1987) is the founder of the viral media company Dose and the founder of MuggleNet, a Harry Potter fansite. ==Early life== Spartz was born in La Porte, Indiana to Tom and Maggi Spartz. He is the oldest of three brothers. At the age of twelve, Spartz convinced his parents to allow him to drop out of school and homeschool himself. He developed his own curriculum, which his parents supplemented by requiring him to read four single-page biographies of successful people every day, which were collected from the pages of Investor's Business Daily. Spartz has subsequently attributed some of his entrepreneurial success to reading these short biographies. ==Career== ===MuggleNet=== Using the WYSIWYG site-building tool Homestead, Spartz founded MuggleNet, a Harry Potter news website and forum, in 1999, at the age of twelve. In fall 2006, while a junior at Notre Dame, Emerson co-authored a book, MuggleNet.com's What Will Happen in Harry Potter 7, which speculated on plot elements of the final Harry Potter book to be released in July 2007. The book remained on the New York Times Children's Bestseller List for six months, peaking in the number two position and selling 350,000 copies. In June 2007, Spartz went on a tour with Ben Schoen, another MuggleNet staff member, to promote their work. In 2009, Emerson Spartz and Ben Schoen wrote another book, MuggleNet.com's Harry Potter Should Have Died: Controversial Views From The #1 Fan Site. By 2007, Spartz was receiving a six- figure income for running MuggleNet and had recruited six paid and 120 volunteer staff to the site. In 2015, he stated, \\"As I became less motivated by my passion for the books, I got obsessed with the entrepreneurial side of [MuggleNet], the game of maximizing patterns and seeing how big my reach could get.\\" Spartz sold MuggleNet and severed his relationship with the magical brand soon after. MuggleNet became an independent brand in 2020. They work closely with their business partner, Topix Media. ===Dose=== In 2009, Spartz launched Spartz Media, now called Dose, a company that originally crowdsourced viral web content across thirty websites. In May 2009, Spartz and Gaby Montero founded GivesMeHope, a website where contributors share answers to the question \\"what gives you hope?\\" in the form of anonymous anecdotes. The site was created in response to FMyLife. In January 2010, Spartz launched OMG Facts. In 2012, OMGFacts.com received 30 million monthly page views, and had 500,000 subscribers on YouTube. Spartz has launched at least thirty websites under the Spartz Media brand, all of which primarily rely on social media sites for web traffic. Because these sites have increasingly operated by republishing previously developed viral content, Spartz's content strategy has been characterized as arbitrage, and has been criticized for failing to license or provide attribution for copyrighted media. In 2014, the company launched Dose.com. In 2015, the company changed its name to Dose and raised $25 million in venture financing, bringing its total capital raised to $34.5 million.Inverso, Emily, \\"Under 30 Emerson Spartz On The Trick To Tackling Viral Content\\", Forbes, 1/7/2016Pletz, John, \\"Emerson Spartz raises $25 million from Tribune Media\\", Crain's Chicago Business, 12/09/2015 In 2016 Spartz was named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 list. ==Personal life== Spartz graduated in May 2009 from the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business.

He was a partner in the North West Company and Chief Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company. Stuart is best known as Simon Fraser's lieutenant who participated in his explorations of present-day British Columbia from 1805 to 1808. Fraser named Stuart River and Stuart Lake in British Columbia for his friend. Stuart was the uncle of Lord Strathcona. ==Background== John Stuart was born at Upper Strathspey, Moray. He was the second son of Donald Stuart (b.c.1740) of Leanchoil—then a farm situated on the edge of the Abernethy Forest—and his wife Janet Grant (b.1743), daughter of Robert Grant of Cromdale. John Stuart's grandfather (brother of the 1st Laird of Cuilt) was descended from the 1st Laird of Auchtow, son of the Duncan MacRobert Stewart, 3rd Laird of Glenogle, Perthshire. As a Jacobite, it is thought that after the Battle of Culloden his grandfather sought refuge under the protection of Clan Grant in Moray, as he was originally from Balquhidder, Perthshire. John's mother was descended from the Chief of Clan Grant of Castle Grant and was a close cousin of the Robert Grant who co-founded the North West Company.Genealogy of the Stuart family John's sister, Barbera, was the mother of Lord Strathcona, and it was Stuart who had attained for him his first role in the Hudson's Bay Company.Lord Strathcona - The Story of his Life by Beckles Willson ==Canada== John's brother was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 38th (1st Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot, but rather than following him, John joined the North West Company in 1796, perhaps under the auspices of Roderick Mackenzie (cousin of Sir Alexander Mackenzie) who had known him as a boy. Stuart and James McDougall were the two clerks who joined Fraser in his explorations. Stuart was Simon Fraser's lieutenant, and in many ways was the real leader of the expedition.The Remarkable History Of The Hudson's Bay Company By George Bryce After Fraser returned to his work in the Athabasca Department in 1809, Stuart was placed in charge of the New Caledonia District from its headquarters at Fort St. James, located on what would be named after him as Stuart Lake. In this position, Stuart was instrumental in establishing a number of new posts, most notably Kamloops House. He was also instrumental in disrupting competition by John Jacob Astor's Pacific Fur Company. Stuart became a partner in the North West Company in 1813 and a Chief factor in the Hudson's Bay Company after its merger with the North West Company in 1821. Stuart is noted for his exploration of Fraser Lake, where he and Fraser built a post, now known as Fort Fraser. Stuart Lake and Stuart River, both in British Columbia are named after him. According to Father Adrien-Gabriel Morice, a missionary and historian of northern British Columbia, Stuart \\"seems to have been one of those well-meaning men who, unconscious of their own idiosyncrasies, make life a burden to others\\". At Stuart's initiative, his nephew Donald Smith (later Baron Mt. Royal and Strathcona) was persuaded to come to Canada, where he would play an instrumental role in the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway. John Stuart returned to Scotland in 1836 and died on 14 January 1847, at Springfield House, near Elgin. He married Catherine Lavalle and had two sons. He also had a daughter Isabel in 1802 whose mother is unknown. In 1827 John Stuart took another country wife, Mary Taylor born 1796. She joined him in Scotland in 1836 but because he withdrew his promise to marry her formally she returned to Rupert's Land in 1838. There was considerable litigation over Stuart's legacy to her, which Stuart's sisters managed to have reduced from L 500 to L350. All of his children were born in Canada and it is believed they remained there after his departure for Scotland. * Isabel Stuart, born in 1802 * Donald Stuart, after 1802. He married while in America and had two sons who died relatively young, the older of the two being a lieutenant in the 78th (Highlanders) Regiment who fought in the Crimean War. * John Stuart, after 1802. It is not known if John remained in Canada or returned to Scotland with his father, nor is it known if he married or had any children. == References == == External links == *Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online *An account of Stuart's role in the competition between the North West and Pacific Fur Companies * Category:1780 births Category:1847 deaths Category:Canadian fur traders Category:Chief factors Category:Scottish explorers of North America Category:Explorers of British Columbia Category:Hudson's Bay Company people ","title":"John Stuart (explorer)"},{"id":"3229070","text":"Marlies may refer to the following: ==Sports teams== *Toronto Marlies, an American Hockey League team *Toronto Marlboros, a former junior hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League, colloquially nicknamed \\"The Marlies\\" for short ==People== Marlies is a Dutch and German feminine given name.

He served in the House of Commons of Canada from 1988 to 1997, as a member of the Liberal Party. Walker was born in Sudbury, Ontario. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Carleton University (1970), a Master of Arts from Queen's University (1974), and a Ph.D. from McMaster University (1976). He was a professor of Political Science at the University of Winnipeg in Manitoba from 1974 to 1988, and was also an adjunct professor at the University of Manitoba from 1977 to 1988. Walker was a partner in Walker-Zimmerman Consultants from 1978 to 1985, and served as president of West-Can Consultants Ltd. from 1978 to 1993. From 1985 to 1987, he was research director for the Angus Reid polling firm. He campaigned for the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1977 provincial election, but finished second against former Progressive Conservative leader Sidney Spivak in the upscale constituency of River Heights. Walker worked as campaign manager to Liberal candidate Lloyd Axworthy in the 1979 and 1984 federal elections (Globe and Mail, 30 April 1979 and 24 August 1984), and worked as an adviser to Axworthy on Via Rail issues in the early 1980s (Globe and Mail, 10 January 1985). ==Books== Walker is the author of \\"Great Winnipeg Dream\\" (1979), and the co-author of \\"Livable Winter Cities\\" (1986), \\"Living Within our Means: The Role of Voluntary Associations\\" (1986) and \\"Canadian Municipalities and Conditions of Fiscal Austerity in International Perspective\\" (1987)and most recently his first novel \\"Wild World\\". He chaired a Task Force of Native Employment in Manitoba in 1980, and a Via Rail task force in 1983-84. He was elected to the Canadian House of Commons in the 1988 federal election, defeating New Democratic Party incumbent Cyril Keeper in Winnipeg North Centre. Walker was the first Liberal candidate ever to win this riding, following sixty-seven years of representation by democratic socialist parties. The Progressive Conservative Party won a majority government in this election, and Walker served for the next five years as a member of the Official Opposition. Walker was the co-leader of Paul Martin's bid to become Liberal Party leader in 1990 (Toronto Star, 3 June 1990). He also worked campaign manager for the Manitoba Liberal Party in the 1990 provincial election (Globe and Mail, 12 September 1990). The Liberals won a majority government in the 1993 election, and Walker was re-elected with a convincing victory over former provincial cabinet minister Maureen Hemphill. He served as parliamentary secretary to Finance Minister Paul Martin from 1993 to 1996, when he was promoted to become chairman of the standing committee on industry (Winnipeg Free Press, 5 March 1996). He was defeated in the 1997 election, narrowly losing to NDP candidate Pat Martin. Walker returned to his consulting business after leaving the House of Commons (Globe and Mail, 20 March 1999). He also worked on Paul Martin's second leadership bid in the early 2000s (National Post, 16 July 2001).

Supported by a number of fellowships (including the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship), he went on to earn a Ph.D. in social psychology from the University of Michigan in 1973. From 1976 to 2012, he maintained a private practice and consultancy while based in Morristown, New Jersey. After earning his J.D. from the Rutgers School of Law – Newark in 1997, Peele was admitted to the New York and New Jersey bars. He maintained a concurrent law practice (including two stints as a pool attorney in the Morris County Public Defender's Office that offered vital insights into the workings of the American criminal justice system) until 2012. As a psychologist and addiction specialist, he has held visiting and adjunct academic positions at New York University (adjunct clinical professor; 2003-2007), Bournemouth University (visiting professor; 2003-2010) and The New School (adjunct professor; 2004-present). He currently resides in Park Slope, Brooklyn, New York.https://twitter.com/speele5?lang=en Peele is the author of twelve books, including Love and Addiction (1975), The Meaning of Addiction (1985/1998), Diseasing of America (1989), The Truth about Addiction and Recovery (with Archie Brodsky and Mary Arnold, 1991), Resisting 12-Step Coercion (with Charles Bufe and Archie Brodsky, 2001), 7 Tools to Beat Addiction (2004), Addiction-Proof Your Child (2007), \\"Recover! Stop Thinking Like an Addict\\" (with Ilse Thompson, 2014), and his most recent book with Zach Rhoads, Outgrowing Addiction: With Common Sense Instead of \\"Disease\\" Therapy, (2019), as well as 250 other professional publications. ==Addiction== He began his critique of standard notions of addiction when he published Love and Addiction (coauthored with Archie Brodsky). According to Peele's experiential/environmental approach, addictions are negative patterns of behavior that result from an over-attachment people form to experiences generated from a range of involvements. He contends that most people experience addiction to some degree at least for periods of time during their lives. He does not view addictions as medical problems but as \\"problems of life\\" that most people overcome. The failure to do so is the exception rather than the rule, he argues. When it was published in 1975, Love and Addiction pre-dated by almost a decade the notion of sex addiction and codependency popularized by authors such as Patrick Carnes, whose Out of the Shadows, one of the earliest popular books to describe sex addiction, came out in 1983, and Melody Beattie, whose Codependent No More was published in 1986. Love and Addiction pre-dated the current popular use of the terms \\"sex addiction\\" and \\"codependency\\" to describe disorders of love attachment, as these terms were not part of Peele and Brodsky's nomenclature. However, because Love and Addiction was concerned with observing the same condition of addictive human attachments, it has been argued that this is the first book to be written on the subject of codependent relationships. In reviewing the legacy of Love and Addiction, psychologist Dr. Alex Kwee wrote: > \\"That experiences can be addictive was a prescient notion in 1975 as > psychology now embraces the concept of the process (or behavioral) > addictions such as pathological gambling, compulsive eating, and sex > addiction. But it must surely be to Peele's dismay that instead of > rethinking substance addiction as a medical illness, psychology has gone and > classified the behaviors as addictions in the same medical sense and yielded > the solution into the hands of the 12-Steps.\\" ==Views on alcoholism== Peele maintains that, depending on the person, abstinence or moderation are valid approaches to treat excessive drinking. In a Psychology Today article which compared the Life Process Program with the disease model, he also argues against the theory proposed decades ago by modern physicians, mental health professionals, research scientists, etc. that addiction is a disease. ==Views on 12 step treatment== In a co-authored book, Resisting 12 Step Coercion (2001), Peele outlined his case against court mandated attendance of twelve-step drug and alcohol treatment programs. He argued that these treatment programs are useless and sometimes harmful, he presented research on alternative treatment options, and accused some addiction providers of routine violation of standard medical ethics, an accusation that is likewise often leveled at PeelePeele, Stanton \\"Resisting 12 Step Coercion\\" Book Online : http://www.morerevealed.com/library/resist/ In The Truth About Addiction and Recovery (1991) and 7 Tools to Beat Addiction (2004) Peele laid out what he believes to be the elements of alternative treatment. He developed these ideas as the Life Process Program, which was the basis for a non-12 Step residential treatment program and is now offered as an online treatment resource by Dr. Peele and colleagues.http://lifeprocessprogram.com/ ==Criticism== In a review of The Meaning of Addiction, addiction researcher Dr Griffith Edwards stated the following about Peele's work: ==Recognition== * 1989: Rutgers Center of Alcohol Studies Mark Keller Award for Alcohol Studies for his article \\"The limitations of control-of-supply models for explaining and preventing alcoholism and drug addiction,\\" JSA, 48:61-77, 1987. *1994: Alfred R.

His mother was a mill worker and French polisher, and his father a carpenter. He lived in Kilbirnie until 1963, when his family moved to Australia, arriving in Darwin, Northern Territory before settling in the Melbourne suburb of Bentleigh. He worked as a bricklayer's labourer before studying at the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), graduating in 1976 along with Linden Wilkinson and Michael Siberry. ==Acting career== Friels career began with work mostly in theatre and television. In 1980 Friels was a presenter on the Australian version of Play School, the series for young children. His first film role was in the unreleased Prisoners (1981), appearing with David Hemmings and Tatum O'Neal. His first appearance in a released film was in Hoodwink (1981), alongside his future wife, Judy Davis. In 1986, he played the title role in Malcolm, about a shy mechanical genius, for which he was awarded the 1986 AFI Award for Best Actor. Friels was also nominated for the Best Actor award the following year, for his role in Ground Zero, but did not win: the film received mixed reviews, with one describing him as \\"a proficient enough actor, but...miscast\\".Hinson, Hal (1988). Ground Zero (review), Washington Post, 30 September 1987. Friels later won another AFI Award in 1995 for his starring role in the 1994 Halifax f.p. telemovie Hard Corps. Friels has played a wide range of other roles. He was a megalomaniac corporate executive in the 1990 feature film Darkman. From 1996 to 1999, he played Frank Holloway on Water Rats,Australian Television Information Archive: Water Rats http://www.australiantelevision.net/water_rats/waterrats.html a role which won him the Logie Award for Most Outstanding Actor at the 1997 awards. In his acceptance speech he said, \\"I'm very flattered for this and it's all rather silly, isn't it? So, thank you very much.\\" Since 2003, Friels has appeared as the main character in the BlackJack series of telemovies. In 2010 he also starred in Killing Time where he played notorious underworld figure Lewis Moran. In 2018 he played Tony Ballantyne in the TV miniseries Mystery Road, again opposite Judy Davis. ==Personal life and views== In late 1997, Friels was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. However, his treatment was successful, and he is one of the very few sufferers of this disease to go into long-term remission. During his treatment he continued to work on the set of Water Rats, until eventually the impact of the chemotherapy stopped him working, and he chose to have his character written out of the series by sending him on a sailing journey around the world. At this time, however, he also continued his stage work, and was performing in Sydney Theatre Company's Macbeth. Friels has been married to actress Judy Davis since 1984; the couple have two children, Jack and Charlotte. They were briefly separated, but later reconciled. The relationship was briefly in the media when an argument led to a court order against Friels: however, they remained together at that time.Graeme Webber and Anthony Stavrinos, \\"Judy Davis takes out violence order against Colin Friels\\", The Age, 31 October 2002, http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/10/30/1035683474314.html Friels believes that social and political awareness comes with acting, and is known for his engagement in policy debates, including industrial issues such as workplace relations and free trade.

The main idea behind Crowds anonymity protocol is to hide each user's communications by routing them randomly within a group of similar users. Neither the collaborating group members nor the end receiver can therefore be sure where in the group the packet originated. Crowds was designed by Michael K. Reiter and Aviel D. Rubin. It defends against internal attackers and a corrupt receiver, but provides no anonymity against a global attacker or a local eavesdropper (see \\"Crowds: Anonymity For Web Transactions\\"). Crowds is vulnerable to the predecessor attack; this was discussed in Reiter and Rubin's paper and further expanded in \\"The Predecessor Attack: An Analysis of a Threat to Anonymous Communications Systems\\" by Matthew K. Wright, Micah Adler, And Brian Neil Levine. Crowds introduced the concept of users blending into a crowd of computers.Fischer-Hubner, Simone (2001) IT-Security and Privacy: Design and use of privacy-enhancing security mechanisms, Springer, p. 134-5 ==How crowds works== # Each user joins a crowd of other users by registering himself at the blender which is a single server responsible for membership management. When a user registers, all the other members in the crowd are notified. The blender is also responsible for key distribution, as it distributes symmetric keys to individual pairs of jondos, used for encryption and decryption, respectively of packets routed along the virtual paths. # Each user is represented by a jondo on her machine which is an application that runs on a user’s computer. # Each jondo either submits a request to the end server or forwards it to a randomly chosen jondo (possibly itself). Other jondo tasks are to strip out any personal information such as cookies, identifying header fields. # A jondo cannot tell if a request is initiated by the previous jondo or one before it. # Request and reply follow the same virtual paths which are constructed using an algorithm involving probabilities. The virtual paths are torn down and reconstructed on a regular basis to allow anonymity for newly added members. ==Definitions== Crowds uses and defines the following terms: ; Sender : The initiator of a message ; Receiver : The final recipient of a message ; Probable Innocence : The attacker is unable to have greater than 50% confidence that any node initiated the message (a node appears equally likely to have initiated the message as to not have - each user is more likely innocent than not.) ; Local Eavesdropper : An attacker that can observe all incoming and outgoing messages for any propersubset of the nodes ; Corrupt Node : A node is corrupt if it uses information obtained from forwarding the message to determine the sender ; C : The number of corrupt nodes ; N : The number of nodes (N - C is the number of good nodes) ; p_f : The probability of forwarding ==Basic Design== Crowds works by making each node seem equally likely to be the initiator of the message. As we said each node joins the network by starting a jondo (from \\"John Doe\\"), which is a small process that will forward and receive requests from other users. When the jondo is started all nodes in the network are informed of the new node's entrance, and will begin to select him as a forwarder. To actually send a message a node chooses randomly (with uniform probability) from all nodes in the network and forwards the message to them. Upon receiving the message the node flips a biased coin (with probability p_f > \\\\frac{1}{2}) and if it lands heads forwards it to another random node, otherwise it forwards it to the final destination. Each node when forwarding to another node records the predecessor and in this way a tunnel is built, this is used for the communication between the sender and the receiver. ===The algorithm on each machine=== # Flip biased coin (\\\\Pr(Heads) = p_f) ## If Heads Then Select a uniformly random node and forward to them ## Else Forward to destination # Record P so that a tunnel can be built ==Security analysis== We consider the question of what information an attacker can learn about the senders and receivers of web transactions, given the mechanisms of Crowds we described. === Local eavesdropper === Recall that every message forwarded on a path, except for the final request to the end server, is encrypted. Thus, while the eavesdropper is able to view any message emanating from the user's computer, it only views a message submitted to the end server if the user's jondo ultimately submits the user's request itself. Since the probability that the user's jondo ultimately submits the request is 1/n where n is the size of the crowd when the path was created. Thus we learn that the probability that the eavesdropper learns the identity of the receiver decreases as a function of crowd size. Moreover, when the user's jondo does not ultimately submit the request, the local eavesdropper sees only the encrypted address of the end server, which we suggest yields receiver anonymity that is (informally) beyond suspicion. (beyond suspicion - no user is more suspicious than other). === Collaborating jondos === Consider a set of collaborating corrupted jondos in the crowd. Because each jondo can observe plaintext traffic on a path routed through it, any such traffic, including the address of the end server is exposed to this attacker. The question we consider here is if the attacker can determine who initiated the path. The goal of the collaborators is to determine the member that initiated the path. We now analyze how confident the collaborators can be that their immediate predecessor is in fact the path initiator: #Let Hk, k >= 1, denote the event that the first collaborator on the path occupies the kth position on the path, where the initiator itself occupies the 0th position (and possibly others). #Let define Hk+ = Hk or Hk+1 or Hk+2 or . . . . #Let I denote the event that the first collaborator on the path is immediately preceded on the path by the path initiator. Note that H1 => I, but the converse I => H1 is not true, because the initiating jondo might appear on the path multiple times. There can be a case where path is composed as follow: :initiator jondo(0 - position) ----> jondo(1 - position) ----> :initiator jondo(2 - position) ----> Collaborating jondo(3 - position) Note that the first collaborator on the path is in the third position. :4.Given this notation, the collaborators now hope to determine: P(IH1+) - given that a collaborator is on the path, what is the probability that the path initiator is the first collaborator's immediate predecessor? Definition: The path initiator has probable innocence if P(IH1+)<=1\\\\2. In order to yield probable innocence for the path initiator, certain conditions must be met in our system. In particular, let pf > 1/2 (the probability of forwarding in the system.) (c - number of collaborators in the crowd) (n - total number of crowd members when the path is formed) The theorem below gives a sufficient condition on pf, c, and n to ensure probable innocence for the path initiator. Theorem: The path initiator has probable innocence against c collaborators in case n \\\\geq \\\\frac{p_f}{p_f - \\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\left( c + 1\\\\right) Proof: we want to show that pf > 1/2 if n \\\\geq \\\\frac{p_f}{p_f - \\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\left( c + 1\\\\right) note that: P(Hi) = (p_f\\\\frac{n-c}{n})^{i-1} (\\\\frac{c}{n}) in order for the first collaborator to be in the ith position on the path, the path must first wander to i-1 noncollaborators each time with probability of \\\\frac{n-c}{n}, each of which chooses to forward the path with probability pf, and then to a collaborator with probability \\\\frac{c}{n}. The next two facts follow immediately from this P(H1+) = \\\\frac{c}{n}\\\\sum_{k=0}(p_f\\\\frac{n-c}{n})^{k} = (\\\\frac{c}{n})(\\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\frac{p_f(n-c)}{n}}) P(H2+) = \\\\frac{c}{n}\\\\sum_{k=1}(p_f\\\\frac{n-c}{n})^{k} = (\\\\frac{c}{n})(\\\\frac{\\\\frac{p_f(n-c)}{n}}{1-\\\\frac{p_f(n-c)}{n}}) P(H1) = \\\\frac{c}{n} P(IH1) = 1 P(IH2) = \\\\frac{1}{n-c} Now, P(I) can be captured as P(I) = P(H1)P(IH1) + P(H2+)P(IH2+) = \\\\frac{c(n-np_fn+cp_f+pf)}{n^2-pfn(n-c)} since I=>H1+ P(IH1+)= \\\\frac{P(I \\\\land H1+)}{P(H1+)} = \\\\frac{P(I)}{P(H1+)} = \\\\frac{n-p_f(n-c-1)}{n} so, if n \\\\geq \\\\frac{p_f}{p_f - \\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\left( c + 1\\\\right) then P(IH1+)<=1\\\\2 E.g. if pf=3\\\\4, then probable innocence is guaranteed as long as n >= 3(c + 1). === Static paths === Dynamic paths tends to decrease the anonymity properties provided by the system against collaborating jondos. The reason is that the probable innocence vanishes if the collaborators are able to link many distinct paths as being initiated by the same jondo. Collaborating jondos might be able to link paths initiated by the same unknown jondo based on related path content or timing of communication on paths. To prevent this, we made paths static, so the attacker simply does not have multiple paths to link to the same jondo. === Embedded images and timing attacks === An HTML page can include a URL (e.g., the address of an image) that, when the page is retrieved, causes the user's browser to automatically issue another request. It is the immediate nature of these requests that poses the greatest opportunity for timing attacks by collaborating jondos. The first collaborating jondo on a path, upon returning a web page on that path containing a URL that will be automatically retrieved, can time the duration until it receives the request for that URL. If the duration is sufficiently short, then this could reveal that the collaborator's immediate predecessor is the initiator of the request. How to prevent? When a jondo receives an HTML reply to a request that it either received directly from a user's browser or submitted directly to an end server, it parses the HTML page to identify all URLs that the user's browser will automatically request as a result of receiving this reply. The last jondo on the path requests these URLs and sends them back along the same path on which the original request was received. The user's jondo, upon receiving requests for these URLs from the user's browser, does not forward these requests on the path, but rather simply waits for the URLs contents to arrive on the path and then feeds them to the browser. In this way, other jondos on the path never see the requests that are generated by the browser, and thus cannot glean timing information from them. ==Scale== The measure of scale that we evaluate is the expected total number of appearances that each jondo makes on all paths at any point in time. For example, if a jondo occupies two positions on one path and one position on another, then it makes a total of three appearances on these paths. Theorem : In a crowd of size n, the expected total number of appearances that any jondo makes on all paths is O(\\\\frac{1}{(1-p_f)^2}(1+\\\\frac{1}{n})) Each jondo's expected number of appearances on paths is virtually constant as a function of the size of the crowd. This suggests that crowds should be able to grow quite large. ==Attacks== Crowds provides perfect anonymity against a corrupt receiver (i.e. d \\\\gets 1 see Degree of anonymity) as all members appear equally likely to have been the initiator. As we showed against collaborating corrupt nodes Crowds provides probable innocence as long as N \\\\geq \\\\frac{p_f}{p_f - \\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\left( C + 1\\\\right) (see the paper for the derivation of this), and provides a degree of anonymity d \\\\gets \\\\frac{\\\\frac{N - p_f \\\\cdot (N - C - 1)}{N} \\\\cdot \\\\lg\\\\left[\\\\frac{N}{N - p_f \\\\cdot (N - C - 1)}\\\\right] + p_f \\\\cdot \\\\frac{N - C - 1}{N} \\\\cdot \\\\lg\\\\left[N/p_f\\\\right]}{\\\\lg (N - C)}. Against the predecessor attack Crowds succumbs in O\\\\left(\\\\frac{N}{C} \\\\lg(N)\\\\right); this attack works by a corrupt node retaining the previous hop in the path, as this will be the sender more than any other node over the rounds of rebuilding the network it will become apparent who the initiator is. Reiter and Rubin mention this and recommend long (and if possible infinite) time between path reformations (caused when a node in the path leaves the network). Crowds is unable to protect against a global eavesdropper as it cannot use encryption on the links, this is because each node in Crowds is able to communicate with every other node (a fully connected graph), because of this setting up symmetric keys requires O(N^2) pairwise keys; this is too large of a number to be feasible. Against a local eavesdropper again Crowds provides no protection as the eavesdropper will see a message coming out of a node that did not enter, and this positively identifies the node as the sender. ==See also== * Onion routing * Tor (anonymity network) * Degree of anonymity * Mix network ==References== ==Further reading== # # # # ==External links== * Anonymity Bibliography * Cryptology ePrint Archive Category:Routing software Category:Anonymity networks ","title":"Crowds (anonymity network)"},{"id":"3229136","text":"Kanger Ghati National Park (also called Kanger Valley National Park) was declared a national park in 1982 by the Government of India. Among the various protected areas in the country, the Kanger Valley National Park near Jagdalpur, in the Bastar region of Chhattisgarh is one of the densest national parks, well known for its biodiversity, landscape, waterfalls, subterranean geomorphologic limestone caves, and home for the Bastar hill myna, the state bird of Chhattisgarh. Located amidst the 34-km-long scenic Kanger Valley, a biosphere reserve, Kanger Valley National Park is one of the most picturesque national parks of India. Spread over an area of approximately consisting mainly of hilly terrain, the park derives its name from the Kanger River, which flows throughout its length. The Kanger Valley National Park is noted for its highly heterogeneous land formations ranging from low flat and gentle areas to steep slopes, plateaus, valleys and stream courses. The vast undulating terrain of the Kanger Valley National Park harbours diverse habitats which offer an ideal site for diverse kinds of flora and fauna, thus making it a hotspot of biodiversity in central India. The park also has a sizable tribal population and is an ideal destination for wildlife enthusiasts, nature lovers, researchers, anthropologists and for anyone who wants to discover the very best of Chhattisgarh wildlife and unique tribes of the region. ==Coordinates and area of the park== The location and area of the park can be seen on the map of the region. The national park lies within the following geographical coordinates: * Latitude: 18° 45' 00\\" N to 18° 56' 30\\" N * Longitude: 81° 51' 30\\" E to 82° 10' 00\\" E The total area of the national park is . The valley starting from the Tirathgarh waterfalls to the Kolab River (Odisha State boundary) is nearly long and the average width is about ==Flora and fauna in the park== ===Flora=== The flora in the park consists chiefly of mixed moist deciduous type of forests with predominance of sal, teak and bamboo trees. In fact, the Kanger Valley is the only region in the Peninsular India where one of the last pockets of virgin and untouched forests are still left. According to the survey done by the Botanical Survey of India and other research organizations, the national park has 553 floral species out of which 12 species are new to Chhattisgarh; 43 species are reported rare. Floral diversity includes insitu gene bank of medicinal plants, grasses, climbers, wild sugarcane, canes, ferns, epiphytes, Sal, teak, bamboo and their rich associates. ===Fauna=== The blind and albinic cavefish (Indoreonectes evezardi) from Kotumsar Cave, India Major wildlife of the Kanger Valley National Park are tigers, leopards, mouse deer, wild cat, chital, sambar, barking deer, jackals, langurs, rhesus macaque, sloth bear, flying squirrel, wild boar, striped hyena, rabbits, pythons, cobra, crocodiles, monitor lizards and snakes. The avian fauna at the park includes hill myna, spotted owlet, red jungle fowl, racket-tailed drongos, peacocks, parrots, steppe eagles, red spurfowl, phakta, bhura teeter, tree pie and heron among many others. A few tributaries form marshy land in early dry season due to natural seepage. Ekta Jhodi, Kyam nullah, Karanji Jhodi, Rajamunda, Punji Jhodi, Komkel Jhodi forms good marshy areas which are good habitat of wild boar and sloth bear. Chital, barking deer, and panther are mainly found in this marshy area. Kariya Ama Nallah is a perennial marshy belt and is ideal habitat for the wild boar, sloth bear, chital, leopard and tiger. The fauna that have been recorded in the national park include: *49 species of mammals *144 species of birds *16 species of amphibians *37 species of reptiles *56 species of fish *91 species of butterflies *26 species of moths *113 species of spiders ==Human settlements in the park and adjoining areas== The national park comprises two ranges viz: Kotamsar and Koleng Ranges. The Kotamsar Range, forming the western half on the park is dotted with revenue villages on its boundary and there is hardly any forest area outside the park for fuel wood, small wood, bamboo and other non-timber forest produce. So the Zone of Influence (Zl) for people in this range is 10 km. The Koleng Range forming the eastern half of the park has a lesser number of villages on its boundary and is comparatively free from biotic pressure. So in the central portion Zone of Influence is 10 km and on eastern boundary it is 5 km. All together there are 48 villages within 5 km radius of national park boundary and only one forest village (Kotamsar) is inside the national park. ==Geology, rock, soil and terrain== The national park has remarkable geological diversity. The national park has mainly Cuddapah group of rock formation and at some places Vindhyan group of rock formation, shales are the common rock formation of Cuddapah group, which are horizontally bedded, at many places calcareous, the other rock formation is slate. In the northwestern part i.e. Tirathgarh, Kamanar, Kotamsar there is outcrop of limestone, sandstone, quartzite and laterites. In northern middle part form Nagalsar to Radhanaras at many places limestone is well exposed and outcrops of quartzite and laterites. limestone caves of Kotamsar, Dandak, Devgiri, and Kailash are present in this part. In the northeastern part from Pulcha to Kolab River, rock is shale and some quartzite with outcrops of granite. In the southsestern part, rock is of vindhyan group mainly granite and sandstone. At few places granite and mica are also present. In the southern middle part, rock is of caddapah group of quartzite and granite. At many places mica schist are present. Shale and sandstone have also outcropped. In the southeastern part, rock is primarily of cuddapah group of granite, shale, slate, sandstone and occasional quartzite outcrop. On slopes laterites are present. At some places vindhyan group of rock are also present. ===Soil=== Poor and rocky soil is found on the hill tops and slopes. Recent deposits are alluvial soils, high and low level laterites, and ferruginous conglomerates. The soils are yellowish-brown, brownish red, reddish and brown in colour and mostly residual in nature. These soils are loamy, sandy and lateritic in nature. The thickness of soil varies from 4 to 6 feet. The soil is slightly acidic with PH value ranging from 5.3 to 7.0. ===Terrain=== The park is Valley of Kanger River. The river flows from NW to SE direction centrally through deep gorges. Both sides of the valley are very steep and are associated with hill ranges. The entire park area is hilly. The eastern half portion is very hilly; the western half is comparatively less hilly. There are small plateaus interspersed with hills. The entire park is full of seasonal nullahs and these nullahs join Kanger River from both sides. Major tributaries of Kanger river from north are Durmunda nullah, Champal Nallah, Kala Jhodi, Mama Bhancha Nallah, Jaraha Nallah, Matkal Jhodi, Kodri Bahar Nallah, Musari Nallah, Karanjr Jhodi, Bade Beda Nallah, Dudung Jhodi. Major tributaries joining Kanger from south are Munga Bahar Nallah, Ekta Jhodi, Karanjl Jhodi, Raja Munda Nallah, Kyam Nallah, Punji Jhodi, Kataguda Nallah, Komkel Jhodi, Kopang Nallah. The altitude of the park varies from above mean sea level. Terrain on northeastern, eastern and southeastern sides is very hilly, steep, high and quite difficult for human intrusion. Kolab River on the eastern border is very rocky with dens and is difficult for human intrusion. The national park is well known for the presence of subterranean limestone caves with dripstones and flowstones [Annexure-9]. The formations of stalactites and stalagmites are still growing. The caves in the national park provide shelter for various species of wildlife. The caves in the national park are inhabited by leopards, porcupines, hyenas, bears, bats, fishes, snakes, frogs, crickets etc. The overhangs are mostly found in the western part (Tirathgarh) and eastern portion (Near Kolab River) of the national park which provide a good habitat for honeybees especially the rock bees. Dens are found on the rocky portions of the National park where wild dogs (dholes), jackals, wolves, foxes, mongoose, etc. occupy them for shelter and breeding. Cliffs are present in Tirathgarh waterfall area and in the western portion of the national park along the Kanger River and Kolab River. They provide ideal habitat for bats, eagles, pigeons, swifts and some reptile species. The bouldery drainages can be seen at Tirathgarh waterfall region, Kanger Dhara and at points where the Kanger River flows from steep height. Sand banks are observed along the Kanger River especially at points where the Kanger River takes a curve. Sand banks are seen at Bhainsadarha located on the eastern portion of the national park where mugger crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris) use it for basking purposes. smooth Indian otters are also found using this habitat. ===Kanger River=== Kanger River is among one of very few perennial rivers of Bastar and herein lies the importance of the river and the park. Kanger River is a lifeline and hills are its recharging reservoir; the whole national park is the catchment of Godavari River. ===Limestone caves=== The Kanger Valley National Park has huge limestone deposits where some of them are in the form of caves and the rest of it are in the form of layers or beds one upon the other. These deposits are present above the soil as well as under the ground level. The underground portions form the caves. The national park is very famous for the long subterranean geomorphological limestone caves and is a major tourist attraction in the region. All limestone caves are present north of Kanger River between Madarkonta and Kodri Bahar. These are Kotamsar cave, Kailash Cave, Dandak Cave, Devgiri Cave. Many other caves were also discovered in the national park. These caves have very fine structures of dripstones i.e. stalactites and stalagmites. Chemically these formations are recrystallized calcium carbonate. These structures have taken million of years to form. Kotamsar and Kailash caves are opened for tourists and other caves are closed for tourists. Only those caves which have openings have been discovered in the National park. There are many caves which have no opening and they are yet to be discovered. ==Places to visit== As approaches to most of the places do not have proper signages guiding movements and it being largely a virgin area, one should visit these places with assistance and under guidance of the local inhabitants. The routes prescribed for tourism in the national park as follows: # Kotamsar Barrier to Kotamsar (5 km) # Kotamsar Barrier to Kanger Dhara (7 km) # Kotamsar Barrier to Kotamsar cave (10 km) # Tirathgarh barrier to Tirathgarh waterfalls (7 km) # Netanar barrier to Kailash cave (5 km) # Nature trail from Kamanar barrier to Tirathgarh waterfalls (3.0 km) # Nature trail from Kailash cave to Kailash zheel (1.5 km) ===Tirathgarh Waterfalls=== Tirathgarh Waterfalls can be termed as \\"Milky Fall\\" because of the white colour of the water as it descends down the rocky slope giving an impression as if milk is falling. It is located around 38 km from Jagdalpur in the renowned eco tourism site of Kanger Valley National Park. The Tirathgarh Falls is one of the most visited waterfalls in Chhattisgarh. Water cascading from the hills surrounding the falls provides splendid views. Splashing streams of water come down at speed from a height of more than 100 feet on the river Mugabahar which originates in a lake not very far away from this point. The area surrounding the fall features green forests. The water flowing through the various streams and crossing numerous paths along the way in a zigzag manner and finally ending up in the falls is a treat to watch. Besides the natural environment associated with this place, Tirathgarh Falls is also an important religious place featuring a temple which is dedicated to Shiva Parvati. Every year, thousands of tourists and devotees come here from within the state and across India for the views of Tirathgarh Falls as well as to offer prayers at the temple. The best season to visit this place is in the months of October through February. ===Kotumsar Caves=== Kotumsar Caves are situated at a distance of about 40 km (25 mi) from Jagdalpur. Kotumsar Caves are about 35 meters below ground level and around 1371 meters long. Kotumsar Cave is a subterranean limestone cave located near the banks of Kanger River in the western portion of the national park. It was discovered by the local people around year 1900 and explored by a renowned geographer Shri Sankar Tiwari in 1951 and it is one of the best known caves in Chhattisgarh as well as in India. The floor of the cave consists of soil/clay, pebbles, rocks and water pools with several lateral and downward passages. Perpetual darkness and constant temperature (28 °C + 1 °C) prevails inside the cave. For entry into the cave, cement concrete steps, Steel steps and railings are available near the entrance side. These caves have got the distinction of being India's first most biologically explored cave. As they are underground, there is pitch- darkness inside. It features stalactite and stalagmite formations. Entry to the caves is through the narrow stairs and visitors have to pass through tall, narrow chambers for gaining access to the main hall that features superb acoustics. The caves feature five chambers having several blind wells. Many tribal tales are also associated with it and are also known as Gupanpal or Kutamsar Caves. The stalactites found inside the cave have been an interesting research topic for scientists and even arouse the curiosity among the visitors. Kotumsar Cave harbours a variety of fauna like bats, frogs, snakes, crickets, spiders, fishes, millipedes, etc. Fishes and frogs are found in the ditches of the cave where as bats, spiders, crickets are found on the ceilings and walls of the cave. Dr. Jayant Biswas has well documented the biology of the cave organisms living in Kotumsar Cave There is lack of oxygen when going deep into the caves. In view of which, for safety reasons, entry beyond certain points has been restricted. The cave is closed from 15 June to 31 October during rainy season. The cave needs removal of debris before tourist season. ===Kailash Caves=== Kailash Caves are located in the Kanger Valley National Park area near Mikulwada. The caves are located around 40 km from Jagdalpur. Discovered recently in 1993, the caves are around 250 meters long and are situated at an altitude of 40 meters above the ground level. It features stalactite and stalagmite formations that offer stunning sight. Access to the cave is through a narrow opening and at the end of the cave is a huge stalagmite formation in the shape of Shivlinga. The hollow walls of the cave, when struck by hand, make incredible musical sounds. ===Bhainsa Darha=== It is located at a distance of 65 km from Jagdalpur. Kanger river is full of deep gorges so darha (water pools) maintain very hygienic quality of water. Crocodiles are mainly found in these darhas. One of the famous ones is Bhainsa Darha. It is surrounded by mountains with thick greenery from all sides. The watch tower situated at Bhainsa Darha gives an awesome view of lake. Bhainsa Darha lake has crocodiles and tortoises. It takes a drive of about two hours to reach Bhainsa Darha. The best time to visit is during winter season. Remember during rainy season roads are closed. It is risky to travel by bike as roads are not good. It is a dense forest so if a vehicle gets punctured then no one will be there to help you. Also no mobile coverage. So you are trapped. Always prefer 4 wheeler especially going with family. ===Kanger Dhara=== Kanger Dhara is located inside the Kanger Valley National Park, 36 km from Jagdalpur. For reaching Kanger Dhara, one should get the applicable permission and tickets from the District Forest Office located at the entry to the park. It is a picnic spot where individuals and families alike spend time. Small cascading falls give visitors enough space to take a bath. The best season for visiting the park is from winters up to summers, after which the park closes for the tourist from the beginning of monsoons in the month of July. Being in the laps of Kanger Valley, Kanger Dhara waterfalls is actually produced by the Kanger River due to presence of undulating rocks present there. Geologists suggest that the area was a sedimentary terrain, later intruded by Igneous rock bodies, due to which, the area has got such folded structures. Just at the beginning of the downstream of Kanger river, when the river falls from undulating folded rocks, it presents a view of small cascades of water fall, which forms the Kanger Dhara. ===Dandak Cave=== Similar to Kotumsar Cave, one can see the stalactites and stalagmites in fantastic formations. ==Best season to visit== The best season to visit the Kanger Valley is November–June. ==How to reach the park== Kanger Valley is well approachable from Jagdalpur in the Chhattisgarh state of India as can be seen on the road network map of the area. Entry into the national park is permitted form Netanar and Kotamsar barriers. Netanar barrier is situated at 33 km from Jagdalpur on the road passing through village Sargipal, Bodal, Murma, and Netanar. The park starts after 3 km from the Netanar barrier. Main entry of the park is from Kotamsar barrier situated at 27 km from Jagdalpur on the Jagdalpur-Darbha road i.e. NH 221 (connecting Jagdalpur to Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh). Inside the park there is good network of Murram and Kutcha roads. Raipur (330 km) is the nearest airport and Jagdalpur (27 km) is the nearest railhead and bus stand from the Kanger Valley National Park. Rest houses, hotels, lodges, and resorts of good quality are available for lodging at Jagdalpur. Inside the park, forest rest houses at Kotamsar and Tirathgarh are available. The nearest petrol pump is at Jagdalpur. Forest wireless system is at Tirathgarh & Netanar.

It was one of three deadly hurricanes during the 1893 Atlantic hurricane season; the storm killed an estimated 2,000 people,Christine Gibson \\"Our 10 Greatest Natural Disasters,\\" American Heritage, Aug./Sept. 2006. mostly from storm surge. ==Meteorological history== The hurricane was first observed on September 27, 1893, in the northwest Caribbean Sea. Its previous history is unknown; possibly it formed from a trough of low pressure in the area, a similar method of formation for two other storms in the same season. The storm moved to the northwest, quickly strengthening into a hurricane on September 28. It continued to intensify to 95 mph winds before striking land near Cancún of the Yucatán Peninsula on the 29th. While crossing the peninsula, the hurricane weakened to 90 mph, but restrengthened over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. A low pressure trough over the northern Gulf of Mexico brought the hurricane northward and northeastward. On October 1, this compact hurricane became a major hurricane, and early the next day, it became a Category 4 as it approached the Louisiana coast. On the morning of October 2, with a peak of 130 mph winds, the hurricane struck southeast Louisiana near Cheniere Caminada, on the Louisiana mainland just west of Grand Isle. The hurricane continued to the northeast, then weakened while crossing southeast Louisiana. Passing over Gulf of Mexico waters for a few hours, the hurricane struck land again on the night of the October 2, this time in southeast Mississippi. The storm continued to the northeast, weakening to a tropical storm over Alabama, and moved into the Atlantic Ocean on October 4. The storm dissipated on the October 5. ==Impact== Ruins of a home in Cheniere Caminada pictured in 2006 As a strengthening hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, the Chenière Caminada Hurricane brought a strong storm surge that flooded much of southeast Louisiana. 779 people died out of the town's 1500 residents from the high winds and flooding from the storm surge. The surge was up to 16 feet, with heavy surf above it. The hurricane caused about 2000 fatalities in total, making it among the deadliest United States hurricanes. The Gulf States were greatly affected by the hurricane. The orange and rice crop were greatly damaged, and combined with destruction of the wind, the hurricane caused about $5 million in damage (1893 USD, $102.6 million in 2005 USD). Many vessels known and unknown were sunk in the hurricane throughout coastal Louisiana and Mississippi including * SS Joe Webre (steamship) * SS Alice McGuigan (schooner): Also listed as Alice McGuigin. * SS Angeline (schooner) * SS New Union (schooner) * SS Rosella Smith (bark) * SS Young American (lugger) * SS Annie E.

The term common squirrel monkey had been used as the common name for Saimiri sciureus before genetic research by Jessica Lynch Alfaro and others indicated S. scuireus covered at least 3 and possibly 4 species: the Guianan squirrel monkey (S. scuireus), Humboldt's squirrel monkey (S. cassiquiarensis) and Collins' squirrel monkey (S. collinsi). The Ecuadorian squirrel monkey (S. cassiquiarensis macrodon), generally regarded as a subspecies of Humboldt's squirrel monkey, had also been sometimes proposed as a separate species that had originally been included within the term \\"common squirrel monkey.\\" ==Range and introductions== Common squirrel monkeys are found primarily in the Amazon Basin. Before the taxon was split, it had been considered to be found within the countries of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela; a small population has been introduced to Florida and many of the Caribbean Islands.LONG JL 2003. Introduced Mammals of the World: Their History, Distribution and Influence (Cabi Publishing) by John L. Long (). However, taxonomic research in 2009 and 2015 determined that several populations that had been considered S. scuireus were actually separate species: * Guianan squirrel monkey, S. sciureus * Collins' squirrel monkey, S. collinsi * Humboldt's squirrel monkey, S. cassiquiarensis The Ecuadorian squirrel monkey, S. cassiquiarensis macrodon, has also sometimes been regarded as a separate species. As a result of these populations no longer being considered S. scuireus, the range of S. scuireus is now limited to Brazil and the Guianas. A group of free-ranging individuals was spotted and photographed in 2009 at the Tijuca Forest in Rio de Janeiro – possibly the result of an illegal release or of an escape from the pet trade;O Globo, 4 May 2009, Ancelmo Gois column by 2010, the squirrel monkey had begun to be considered as an invasive species in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest, and concerns were expressed about its role as a predator of eggs of endangered bird species. The common squirrel monkey prefers to live in the middle canopy, but occasionally comes to the ground or goes up into the high canopy. They like vegetation which provides good cover from birds of prey in the rainforest, savannah, mangroves, or marshlands. At least five populations of common squirrel monkeys have existed in Florida since the 1960s, if not earlier. Common squirrel monkeys have been established at Silver Springs since at least the late 1960s; rhesus macaques were established in the area by 1938, but there is no firm information on when the squirrel monkeys were released. In the 1960s, a colony of twelve to fifteen common squirrel monkeys was noted residing in a hammock of trees by the springs; they migrated downstream to the Ocklawaha River by 1975. Another population, derived from two pairs released in the 1960s, lives on the Bartlett Estate in Broward County; they numbered 43 in 1988. In 1976, 15 squirrel monkeys escaped from the Tropic Wonderland attraction in Titusville, Florida; their descendants have since become established in the area. In the 1980s, 500 and 1000 common squirrel monkeys remained in the shuttered Masterpiece Gardens park in Polk County, persisting despite efforts to capture them. Additionally, a \\"semi-free-ranging\\" population has existed at Monkey Jungle in Goulds in Miami-Dade County since 1960. ==Biology and behavior== ===Diet=== Common squirrel monkeys are considered both frugivorous and insectivorous, preferring berry-like fruit on branches. When in captivity, squirrel monkeys are fed fruits such as apples, oranges, grapes, and bananas. They also consume a variety of vegetables that include lettuce, celery, and onions. Squirrel monkeys also look for insects and small vertebrates, such as tree frogs. It obtains a majority of its water from the foods eaten, and also obtains water from holes in trees and puddles on the ground. When fruit is scarce, the common squirrel monkey drinks nectar. The amount of time squirrel monkeys spend foraging depends on the type of food. When bigger fruits and easy access occur, they do not spend much time foraging. Otherwise, they dedicate a considerable amount of time to looking for their foods. Foraging also keeps the monkeys entertained and active. Oftentimes when they are captive, they easily become bored as the food is more easily obtained. ===Social behavior=== Common squirrel monkeys are polygamous with a multiple- male, multiple-female group structure. Most social interactions in S. sciureus groups occur within the various age/sex classes, with the division of classes being between adult male categories, mother-infant categories, and juvenile categories. The core of the group is made up of the adult females and their young. As a result of the natural attraction each class has to the adult females, the different age/sex classes come together as one social group. Though juveniles play and jump around an appreciable amount during phases of high activity, they usually stay close to the adult females. In terms of the males’ level of attraction to the adult females, the phase of the yearly reproductive cycle determines their distance from the adult females. Overall, interactions between the various age/sex classes are most frequently directed to adult females. The division of age/sex classes among S. sciureus is not so strictly defined because the degree of segregation between gender can vary. That is, those subspecies which have a high degree of sexual dimorphism are sexually segregated, such that the males and females of that subspecies interact less with each other than do those of subspecies that are not very sexually dimorphic and thus sexually integrated. Seasonal reproduction plays a major role in the social behavior of common squirrel monkeys, where the frequency of between-sex interactions of the males and females differs between the birth season and the mating season. Adult males are generally socially inactive during the birth season and spend their time travelling and foraging at a distance from the group. During the mating season, though, the adult males become fatter, excited, aggressive, and highly vocal and spend most of their time engaging in dominance interactions among themselves or following and approaching the adult females in estrus, in hopes of being able to mate with them. Males can increase their chances at copulating with receptive females by approaching them quietly. Nonreceptive females, though, respond aggressively to any male approach and threaten and chase the males away, usually with the help of surrounding females. Overall, intersexual interaction among common squirrel monkeys greatly increases during the mating season. Common squirrel monkey infants develop rapidly. They become fairly independent between five and eight months of age and spend only a small percentage of the day with their mothers. Also at this age range, the infants can find food on their own. Infants are active members of the social group, climbing, running, exploring, and frequently making contact with adult members of the group. Most adult-infant interactions are initiated by infants towards adult females that are not their mothers. Adults generally respond to the infants calmly, but some adults may respond with antagonism. Infants rank the lowest in the group. Many other aspects of common squirrel monkey social behavior, such as dominance relationships, coalitions, dispersal patterns, and aggression, stem from the feeding ecology of the animals. Feeding ecology directly affects the females of the group which in turn affects the behavior of the males in the group. The feeding patches for common squirrel monkeys are very small and dense, which makes it possible for an individual with the greatest capability of winning a fight, if one were to occur, to monopolize access to any patch. Within-group competition among common squirrel monkey groups is extremely high, and between-group competition is moderate to high. Coalition formation is not as stable as would be expected among the females of the group because considering their small and dense feeding patches, common squirrel monkey females with the greatest capability of winning a fight would benefit more if they were to form alliances to gain control of a patch and then not share the patch once in control of it. Once sexually mature, all males emigrate from their natal groups. After leaving, they may either become solitary, a peripheral of another troop, join another mixed-sex troop, or attend a tolerant troop of another monkey species. If they become a peripheral of another group, the male squirrel monkey chooses one troop and keeps a certain distance away from them while still trying to follow them. These males are the less dominant ones. A few male squirrel monkeys have been observed interacting with groups of other monkey species. Some females may leave their natal groups, as well, although they tend to be more philopatric. If females do leave their natal groups, they do it after becoming sexually mature. Often, they migrate before or right after a mating season. Due to this, they might end up leaving their group when they are pregnant or with their immature offspring. Males are typically dominant to females, but females still have a high status in the group. and are capable of forming coalitions against dominant males. Rarely do males form coalitions even if a group of males keeps their distance from the main group or are solitary. Several theories suggest that one of the reasons that male squirrel monkeys do not form coalitions is because of the lack of kinship due to emigration. Coalitions may also increase mortality risks within the group since males tend to be aggressive to each other. Genital display among males is an important social signal in relation to group hierarchy; it is derived from sexual behavior, but is used for social communication. It involves the animal spreading his thighs and having an erect penis. Dominant males display to submissive males to emphasize their higher status. The dominant males direct their action to the face of the passive males, and the act can be done with the displayer leaning over the passive monkey or the displayer doing the action from a distance in a more upright position. This form of dominance interaction, as well as several types of aggression, increase during the mating season when males want to emphasize their rank and strength and gain more control over other males in relation to access to females. Genital displays may also define male-male alliances when the males participate in \\"joint genital displays\\". ===Habits=== Common squirrel monkeys are diurnal. They are usually quiet, but will utter loud cries when alarmed. They use different types of calls for specific situations. Some of their common call types include caws, bawls, and shrieks. Squirrel monkeys utter caws mostly when they are trying to defend a territory. They may use bawls prior to a fight, as well as after one. Shrieks are mainly heard when the monkeys are fighting for dominance. Squirrel monkeys’ most common calls are determined by their genetics. Squirrel monkeys that have been isolated since infancy are able to produce the same calls as those that have been exposed to the calls. Few variations exist between the frequencies of the calls of infants that were raised differently. A squirrel monkey that was deaf since birth was also able to produce the same calls, proving that the calls come from their genes. It is arboreal, but sometimes it comes down to the ground. Bands or troops can number from 12-100. Occasionally, troops as large as 500 have been seen in undisturbed forests. ==Conservation status== Prior to the taxon being splits, common squirrel monkeys were rated as \\"least concern\\" by IUCN, but subject to being harmed by deforestation. They have also been captured extensively for the pet trade and for medical research. ==As pets== Due to their inquisitive and playful nature these common squirrel monkeys are popular pets. They require a large amount of space and food. ==Gallery== Image:Monkey toes.jpgAt the Phoenix Zoo Image:Squirrelmonkey01.jpgAt the Phoenix Zoo Image:Nice squirrel monkey.jpgAt the Phoenix Zoo Image:Squirrel Monkey walkthrough.JPGIn the walkthrough area of the Woburn Safari Park Image:Squirrel monkey (31223593306).jpgA pet squirrel monkey in a cage at a house in the former plantation Rust en Werk Image:Ola Cotney monkey.jpgPet squirrel monkey on lady's shoulder ==References== Category:Mammals of Colombia Category:Mammals of Brazil Squirrel Monkey, Common Category:Squirrel monkeys Category:Space-flown life Category:Mammals of Ecuador Category:Mammals of French Guiana Category:Mammals of Suriname Category:Mammals of Venezuela Category:Primates of South America Category:Paraphyletic groups ","title":"Common squirrel monkey"},{"id":"3229239","text":"Navegaon National Park is a National park located in the Arjuni Morgaon subdivision of Gondia district in state of Maharashtra, India. The Dr Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary, Navegaon is home to almost 60% of the bird species found in entire Maharashtra. Every winter, flocks of migratory birds visit the lake. The national park has diverse type of vegetation ranging from dry mixed forest to moist forest. The forest type is 5 A/C3. Southern tropical dry deciduous forest. ==Etymology== The name \\"Navegaon\\" comes from the word Nave + gaon (Nave means new in Marathi and Gaon means village). This area also known as Navegaon Bandh locally (bandh means dam in English) because of the presence of the water body. Mostly tribal people lives here and this area was under Gond Kings in the old days. Strolling down the lanes of history, we can find traces of the existence of the Kohali Community as far back as 1300 A.D. and beyond. Even in that primitive era, the Kohali community was recognized as geologists in a broader sense, as geophysics may have been in its infancy in our land. This community had developed skills, by inheritance, in excavation and stone- construction work. Archives shows, that the grandiose temples at Jagannath- puri and Bhubneshwar, the picturesque lakes of Kashmir and Rajasthan, were constructed by the Kohali community. This can be corroborated from documented reports in the Book, \\" Aaj Bhi Khare Hain Talav \\" a Gandhi Pratisthan Publication, New Delhi. This tribe headed by the brave explorer Nathan Lewis, in search of a vacation, migrated to Central India, concentrating in areas known today as Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Bhandara and Gondia Districts, where their population density is pretty high. But as William Blake the poet says that the wheels of fortune must turn, so fortune had in store, something surprising for this industrious community would change the course of their destiny. Rani Durgawati, after her marriage to king Dalpatshah the powerful Gond Kings, plunged into the affairs of the state. The welfare of her subjects, become her paramount concern. Agriculture was the source of livelihood, and agriculture depends on whims of Lord Indra and his supply of water. To supplement resources, reservoirs, lakes (known as tank or talavas in local dialect) were essential. This far-sighted consort of king Dalpatshah, chose these hardy sons of the soil, the Kohalis, to take up this venture. So, in the year 1300 A.D., the great exodus of the Kohalis began in right earnest. They were awarded large farming tracts as incentives, for constructing tanks, canals and waste weirs for storage and supply of water. They were also conferred with the title of 'PATEL' or PATIL'. As the zamindari and malguzari system was not in vogue, these Patels/Patils were entrusted with the job of collecting agricultural cess. Agricultural development being the main item on the agenda of the queen, two brothers viz. Kolhu and Chimna Patil of the Kohali community, were delegated with the task of constructing a lake (at Navegaon) in the year 1300. From here begins the saga of Madhaorao Patil’s ancestors Kolhu & Chimna, scions of Bija Patil Dongarwar. This diligent brother-duo, first made alternate arrangements to resettle the displaced inhabitants of 12 villages, that were going to be affected by the construction of lake and that is today’s Navegaon village. Hundreds of labourers were employed in construction of the lake and dam-wall. Mode of payment to labourers was in the form of conches and mollusc shells. Herds of cattle were pressed into service, to trample the freshy excavated and water-sprinkled soil dumped for the dam-wall, to provide solidity. Water stored in the reservoir, would be provided free of cost to all farmers. After completing the dam, to express their gratitude to God, a fish of the ‘Wadis’ species was caught and adored with 30 Tolas of Gold ornaments and again released in the tank. This fish was reported to be sighted for several years, resplendent in all its ornaments. While constructing the dam, a temple of God Hanuman was simultaneously constructed. Here, the lookers on the construction site, first paid obeisance daily, before commencing the work. For accumulation of water, a 200-yard sloping waste weir was built which also facilitate Eel fish from the back-waters of the sea to enter the lake by rivulets for spawning. The Govt took over the management of this dam in 1951. They dismantled this waste-weir and reconstructed another waste-weir in the form of water-fall. Kolhu and Chimna Patil had 7 sisters, and in their love for them, constructed a tank bund and named it as “Sat-Bahini” or dam of seven sisters. Kolhu Patil was childless and to keep alive his memory and as a tribute, the hillock within the dam was named as “Kolhasur” or Kolhu Patil lake. Eleventh line generation of Chimna Patil viz. Madhaorao Patil, has son Shrinarayan Patil and grandson Bhimsen Patil are today residing at village Dhabe-Paoni which is 10 km from Navegaon Bandh in Moregaon Arjuni Takuka of Gondia district and easily accessible to vouch for the authenticity and veracity of this write up. The island in the middle of the lake is known as \\"Maldonger\\" and was used by the villagers as a refuge from the marauding 'Pindaris' (A tribe of professional robbers). ==Significance== It is located in the eastern part of Maharashtra state and covers an area of 133.78 km2. It has great importance from nature conservation point of view. It is indeed nature priceless assets and beckons one and all to enjoy its picturesque landscape, its pure and fresh air. It has got immense potentials from biodiversity conservation point of view. One can also join the jungle safari and stroll through the beautiful forest, crossing paths with leopards, sloth bears, gaurs, sambars, chitals and langurs. Staying in the unique tree-top house, riding a power or sail boat on the lake, are thrilling pastimes. Nearly 50,000 tourists visits this tourist complex annually. Places of interest around the national park are Nagzira Wildlife Sanctuary (60 km), Itiadoh Dam (20 km), Tibetan Camp at Gothangaon (15 km) and Pratapgad (15 km). === Ecological or environmental values === It is an important conservation unit in Central India in general and Vidarbha in particular. It acts a “Green-lung” for the adjoining human settlements and helps in maintaining the environmental balance. ===Zoological values=== Though Navegaon is better known as a bird sanctuary, a number of wild animals could also be sighted. The vertebrate fauna includes, besides a number of fishes, 209 species of birds, 9 species of reptiles and 26 species of mammals which includes Tiger, Panther, Jungle cat, Small India Civet, Palm Civet, Wolf, Jackals, Bisons, Sambars, Nilgais, Chitals, Wild boars, Sloth Bears, and Nathan Lewis in this national park. ===Botanical values=== One of the unique features of this sanctuary is the existence of diverse vegetation type ranging from dry mixed forests to moist forests. Its forests belong to the category of “Southern Tropical Dry Deciduous Forests” – 5A/C3 as per the revised classification of the forests by Champion and Seth. This sanctuary serves as a living repository of various economical, medicinal, aromatic, ornamental plant species. It includes, Teak, Haldu, Jamun, Kawat, Mahua, Ain, Bhel and Bhor. ===Geological values=== This sanctuary exhibits an amazing diversity of terrain and the altitude ranges from nearly 30 meters to about 702 meters above the mean sea level, which is the highest point of the sanctuary. The typical geological formations are Sakoli Series having number of formations made of phyllites, slates, chlorites etc. and Saucer Series. The rocks of the two groups appear to show difference in chemical composition of lime bearing rocks. The mineralogical difference is that the rocks of Saucer group commonly contain Felspar and Biolite but no chlorite whereas those of Sakoli group contain invariably chlorite, rarely Biolite and no Felspar. All this is coupled with a diversity of terrain having steep ridges, narrow valleys and deep gorges with varying altitude. ===Threats=== Human-wildlife conflict is common, with killing of domestic livestock by tigers and leopards as a frequent phenomenon in the areas neighboring villages. This has an adverse impact on the economic condition of the local people and results in antagonism towards the management. In many years there have been up to 3 people and 30-50 cattle heads killed by tigers or leopards. ==Bio-geographic zonation== As per the Biogeography classification adopted by Wildlife Institute of India, Duration, this sanctuary is classified as follows. :i) Bio-geographic Kingdom – Paleotropical :ii) Sub Kingdom – Indomalaysian :iii) Bio-geographic Zone – 6 – Deccan Peninsula :iv) Biotic Province – 6 B – Central Deccan. This Bio- geographic zone is one of the least protected bio-geographic zones in India, rich in floral and faunal diversities. Hence it needs high degree of Protection. ==Location== *State: Maharashtra *District: Gondia *Tahsil: Situated in Arjuni Tahsil of Gondia District. Circle: Geographically the area of this national park comes under the Nagpur Circle of the State Forest Department. *The administration and management of this sanctuary comes under the control of the Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife), Nagpur. *Division: The administration and management of this sanctuary comes directly under Conservator of *Forests (Wildlife), Gondia.

It was executive produced in part by Steven Spielberg, as DreamWorks' first animated series. The show had recurring cartoon series that appeared in each episode. (Unlike Animaniacs, Toonsylvania did not have a wide range of characters and almost every episode had the same content.) The main segments were \\"Frankenstein\\", \\"Night of the Living Fred\\", \\"Attack of the Killer B Movies\\" and \\"Melissa Screetch\\". ==Plot summary== A typical episode of Toonsylvania starts with a cartoon series called \\"Frankenstein\\" (a parody of Mary Shelley's novel of the same name), about the adventures of Dr. Vic Frankenstein (voiced by David Warner), his assistant Igor (voiced by Wayne Knight) who always sets out to prove that he is a genius like his master, and their dim-witted Frankenstein Monster known as Phil (voiced by Brad Garrett). Before the second cartoon, there is an animated vignette where Igor is on the couch with Phil and tries to fix the TV remote, but in every episode there is a new problem with it (a running gag akin to the couch gags seen on The Simpsons). After that, there is a cartoon series called \\"Night of the Living Fred\\", about a family of zombies. This segment was created by cartoonist Mike Peters. Sometimes, a parody of a B-list horror movie would air instead of a \\"Night of the Living Fred\\" cartoon. After that, there is a short segment called \\"Igor's Science Minute\\", where Igor gives a science lesson (be it a musical piece or a spoken piece) that always ends in disaster. The final segment is \\"Melissa Screetch's Morbid Morals\\", where Phil the Frankenstein Monster does something bad and Igor punishes him by reading a horror tale involving a bratty girl named Melissa Screetch (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) who does not heed the warnings of adults (usually given by her mother) and suffers the consequences for it one way or another. ===Second season changes=== In season two, Bill Kopp and Jeff DeGrandis left the show and were replaced by Paul Rugg. The series' format changed into more of a sitcom style, with Igor, Dr. Vic Frankenstein and Phil interacting with a variety of new characters, including a snooping next-door neighbor Seth Tuber (voiced by Jonathan Harris), who was based on Norman Bates from Psycho. He interacted with his \\"immobile\\" mother by putting his hand over his mouth and talking into it. There was also a typical Transylvanian angry mob that was, in fact, a cheerful group of Beatles-esque hipsters. Most of these new characters were voiced by Paul Rugg, who also improvised many of their lines. The only other backup segments to re- materialize in season two were the B-movie parodies (though some episodes of \\"Night of the Living Fred\\" aired) and Melissa Screetch in a new segment called \\"The Melissa Screetch Show\\". Whenever Melissa was disappointed with a friend or a family member, she would go home and cover herself under her bed sheets where she pretended to host a show. She then had her transgressor on as a guest star and often did away with them in an ironic manner. ==Series overview== == Episodes == === Season 1 (1998) === === Season 2 (1998–99) === ==Music== The music for the series was written by Michael Tavera, Keith Baxter, Christopher Neal Nelson, John Paul Given, Christopher Klatman and Thom Sharp.

The Kingdom was founded in 1870 by King Jaja. A greater part of the city state is still referred to as Opobo in Rivers State. Opobo is made up of several islands and communities, mainly Opobo Town (Opuboama), Queenstown, Kalasunju, Oloma, Ayaminimah, Iloma, Minimah, Okpukpo, Iwoma, Ekereborokiri, Kalaibiama, and Epellema. A part of the city state is now in Akwa Ibom State, made up of Ikot Abasi, Kampa. ==History== 220x220px Opobo (Or Opubo-ama, being a name derived from that of a revered Bonny king, Opubo the Great) is located to the east of the Kingdom of Bonny. Bonny and Opobo are of the same origin, both belonging to the Ibani tribe. An Igbo man (who was subsequently initiated into the Ibani) called Jubo Jubogha rose from slavery to lead the Anna Pepple chieftaincy house of Bonny. In 1870, Jubo first arrived in what is now Opobo, having moved there due to a civil war in Bonny between his followers and those of Chief Oko Jumbo, the leader of the rival Manilla Pepple chieftaincy family. He was accommodated by the Nkoro leader King Kpokpo,https://www.scribd.com/doc/36981645/The-Izon-of-the-Niger-Delta- Chapter-22 and formed what he called the \\"Kingdom of Opobo\\" soon afterwards. The king named his new state after Amanyanabo Opubo \\"Pepple\\" Perekule the Great, a Pepple king in Bonny that had reigned there from 1792 to 1830. Jubo Jubogha became involved in palm oil trading with Europeans. He started a trading post at Opobo Town, close to Ikot Abasi and 4 miles southwest of the Opobo river. Due to his dealings with them, he soon acquired the trade name Jaja. Jubo Jubogha was never on good terms with the Ngwa people to the north, or the Annang and the Ibibio to the east, as he declared himself as the middleman in palm oil trading, thus asking them to stop trading directly with the Europeans. This resulted in a war (the Ikot Udo Obong War) between Jubo and the Annang and Ibuno people as recorded by Nair.Cf. Nair, 1972, page 183 In 1887, he was deceived when he was told to go and negotiate with the Queen of England by the British. He was captured upon his arrival on the consul's flagship, and was sent into exile in Saint Vincent in the West Indies thereafter. ==Traditions== The following are a few of Opobo's unique customs: * Dogs are forbidden in Opobo. This tradition, which has its roots in ancient times, is one of the most important taboos the people of this coastal town hold on to. While the people are free to bring in dog meat to eat in their homes whenever they feel like it, they are not allowed to keep dogs as pets or bring such into the community. For those, who flout this grand rule, the penalty is usually grave. In addition * In Opobo, one is not allowed to shoot a gun. Such a thing is only to occur by royal sanction during a war. * Individuals are forbidden from wearing caps while passing through the gateway linking one compound to another. The gateways are small roofed passages, essentially a series of tunnels, connecting one compound to another. On the floor of such gateways is a crossbar, which those passing are forbidden from stepping foot on. Adhering to this rule while passing through the place is a mark of respect for the high chief of a particular compound, which is also referred to as a war canoe house. While these taboos could be said to hold sway during daytime, another set of unusual ones rules the land at nighttime. Some of that set include: * Making noise, pounding or quarrelling at night is forbidden. While it is not uncommon to hear giant loud speakers blaring music at hundreds of decibels at night time, with a cacophony of voices providing background percussion in other communities, in Opobo such a thing is totally forbidden. Making any form of noise at night is one of the biggest offences anyone can commit in this island community. You could be labelled an enemy of the town. Similarly, quarrelling and fighting at night is taboo here as well. Regardless of how provoked you are, you must wait till the break of dawn to vent your anger on whoever has provoked you. Breaking any of these rules attracts a fine of N7,000 each or a serious punishment by the community heads . ===The Initiation into Womanhood=== A certified wife who has not been initiated into womanhood with the appropriate initiation ceremony, known as the Mgbede, is not allowed to tie a special wrapper called 'George'. Such a woman would also be denied many other rights: there are sacred places that she cannot enter and she will not be entitled to mix freely with women that have been initiated.

It also provides sea-lift, underway support, sea-basing and logistics capabilities for combined army and naval missions. ==Features== Joint Support Ships have several common features to support the many multi-roles it can fulfill for both navies and armies. Below are some examples of these common features: * For sealift deck space is required for transport of heavy equipment and passenger space for military personnel. * For underway support Joint Support Ships need enough fuel storage tanks and dry storage for ammunition/food and other supplies for replenishing other ships while underway. * And for sea basing command rooms for mission coordination, a helicopter deck and/or LCU's for transport to shore and other support facilities like hospital rooms. Furthermore, to fulfill the multi-role part a flexible modular design allows for configuration of temporary areas for different purposes as missions require. As such it is basically a combination of an amphibious warfare ship and different auxiliary ships like replenishment oiler, transport ship and hospital ship in one. ==German Taktische Konzept Mehrzweckschiff== Proposed ship 196 meters long, 20,000 ton displacement. * Range 7500 nautical miles * RoRo capability * space for 271 vehicles * 8 helicopters * 1 landing craft * Room for 700 military personnel * and a 70-bed hospital with 2 operating rooms ==Canadian Joint Support Ship== In 1999 the Canadian Government sought to replace the aging of auxiliary oiler replenishment (AOR) ships through the Afloat Logistic Support Capability (ALSC) program. The replacement program envisioned tanker ships with a roll- on/roll-off (RO/RO) sealift capability. These multi-role ships were envisioned to deploy mobilized forces directly to the beach. In 2004, Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Joint Support Ship (JSS) to replace the three AOR ships, although one AOR ship was already retired by the time the RFP was released. The RFP capped the bid price at $1.5B. (most reports state the cost was $2.1B, however $600M was reserved for the Government's own project costs, and was not included in the RFP bid ceiling price). The RFP called for three multi-role ships capable of refueling ships at sea, providing ship-borne helicopter support, heavy sealift capability, a mobile hospital, a joint force headquarters center, and a strengthened hull for operations in sea ice. PWGSC cancelled the program in 2008 after stating all the received bids were above the mandatory budget. The Canadian Government restarted the JSS procurement process in the same year. In 2013 Canada selected the replenishment ship design to replace the Protecteur- class fleet. The German design provides fuel, provisions, ammunition, and some materiel and medical capabilities, and can land up to two helicopters. The ships are to be built in Vancouver by Seaspan Shipyards under the National Ship Procurement Strategy (NSPS). Originally to be designated as the Queenston class with ship names of HMCS Queenston and HMCS Châteauguay (named after battle sites from the War of 1812), in 2017 the Royal Canadian Navy renamed the Joint Support Ships to the former Protecteur-class designation, re-using the same ship names HMCS Protecteur and HMCS Preserver. The cost of building the two replenishment ships was set at $2.3B (CAD) with first delivery occurring in 2018. In 2018, the Government's own review indicated the total cost was then calculated to be $3.4B, with first delivery not likely before 2022 or 2023. As of 2019, delivery of the first vessel was expected to occur in 2023 followed by the second vessel in 2025. https://www.tpsgc- pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/amd-dp/mer-sea/sncn-nss/interarmees-joint-eng.html ==Dutch Joint Support Ship== Artist impression of the JLOS Karel Doorman Since 2015 the Royal Netherlands Navy has HNLMS Karel Doorman as their only Joint Support Ship.

It was a massive forced displacement of people from the Jujuy Province, by orders of General Manuel Belgrano, conducted by his patriot forces that were battling a Royalist army. The population was compelled to leave under the threat of execution. \\"los desobedientes serian tratados como traidores y pasados por las armas\\". Roca, José Luis (2007). Ni con Lima ni con Buenos Aires: la formación de un estado nacional en Charcas. Plural Editores, p. 315. ==Development== During early 1812, Manuel Belgrano had created the cockade and Flag of Argentina near the city of Rosario, and then received order to move to the north. He would take command of the Army of the North, based in the city of San Salvador de Jujuy. The situation was not favourable: a short time before Juan José Castelli had led the First Alto Perú campaign and, despite an initial advantage and a brief time ruling the Upper Peru, faced a decisive defeat during the Battle of Huaqui. The surviving patriots and remains of the Army had retreated to the south, to Jujuy. They were lacking men, weapons and money, and had to stop a victorious army, better armed and four times bigger. The loyalists, led by General Pío Tristán, were advancing south with 3,000 troops from today's Bolivia, into the northwest of Argentina (through Humahuaca). The revolutionaries were outnumbered 2 to 1, demoralized, badly armed, far from the assistance of the central government, and facing an outbreak of malaria without medication. In addition, many of the locals, especially of the higher classes, resented the arrival of forces from Buenos Aires and were ready to defect. Belgrano, faced with the prospect of total defeat and territorial loss, ordered all people to pack their necessities, including food and furniture, and follow him, in carriages or on foot, together with whatever cattle and beasts of burden could endure the journey. The rest (houses, crops, food stocks, and also any objects made of iron) was to be burned, so as to deprive the loyalists of resources, following a strict scorched earth policy. On 29 July 1812 Belgrano asked the people of Jujuy to \\"show their heroism\\" and join the march of the army under his command \\"if, as you assure, you want to be free\\". The punishment for ignoring the order was execution and the destruction of the defector's properties. Belgrano labored to win the support of the populace, and later reported that most of the people had willingly followed him without the need of force. The exodus started on 23 August and gathered people from Jujuy and Salta; people travelled south about 250 km, finally arriving at the banks of the Pasaje River, in the province of Tucumán, on the early hours of 29 August. The Exodus is commemorated in Jujuy by traditionalist groups with an Evocative March, every 22 August since 1955. The Jujuy Province is declared honorific capital of Argentina each 23 August since 2002, by national law 25.644.Ley 25.644 ==See also== * Estadio 23 de Agosto ==References== ==External links== * El Éxodo Jujeño at Jujuy.com (in Spanish). * Manuel Belgrano - El militar - Argentine Ministry of Education. * El Éxodo Jujeño - Portal of the province of Salta. * Marchas Evocativas - Marches commemorating the Exodus.

Typically, molten lead or tin is dropped into water. It can be found as a tradition in various cultures, including Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Turkey. Some versions have been found to have potentially harmful effects on human health. == Method == Lead (or more recently tin) shapes are melted in a ladle over a flame, and the molten liquid is then poured into the water. The resulting shape is either directly interpreted as an omen for the future, or is rotated in a candlelight to create shadows, whose shapes are then interpreted. The shapes are interpreted symbolically, for example a bubbly surface signifying money, a fragile or broken shape misfortune. The shape of the lead before melting can refer to a specific area of one’s life. For example, ships for traveling, keys for career advancement, etc.https://www.rakentaja.fi/artikkelit/723/uudenvuoden_taikoja.htm ==Finland== In Finland, shops sell ladles and small bullions in the shape of a horseshoe for this express purpose. Originally made from tin, now they are made from cheaper low-melting alloys based on lead. The practice is known as uudenvuodentina. The world's largest uudenvuodentina, , was cast by members of the Valko volunteer fire department in Loviisa, Finland, in New Year 2010. The shapes are often interpreted not only literally, but also symbolically: a bubbly surface refers to money, a fragile or broken shape misfortune.

Kloss had founded a number of earlier loudspeaker and consumer audio companies, including Acoustic Research, KLH and Advent Corporation. It was founded with the specific mission to design and manufacture well-priced, high quality, high performance loudspeakers and audio products to be marketed directly to the consumer. From its inception, the company's success was significant and its products received critical acclaim. Cambridge SoundWorks began offering its products (such as the Ensemble I, II, and III satellite speaker systems) by catalog and multi-page magazine advertisements. In 1991, the company opened its first retail location in Newton, Massachusetts. In 1994 it sold its first products on the Internet, using the CompuServe network. This made it one of the first companies to sell consumer electronics on the Internet. The unique selling formula developed in its first store proved successful and eventually spawned the opening of 30 showrooms in New England and metropolitan San Francisco. In 1997 Cambridge Soundworks was bought by then Creative Labs. Eventually, Cambridge SoundWorks manufactured over 60 different models of home stereo, home theater, multimedia speakers and assorted electronics products. Its products were designed in California, with Research and Development and Acoustic Engineering in Massachusetts. These products, along with other major brands of high- performance audio and video components, were sold through an online store. As of February 2018, the Cambridge Soundworks website redirects to theoontz.com, where a product line of portable bluetooth speakers is sold. ==Cambridge SoundWorks today== As of 2020, all Cambridge SoundWorks retail showrooms are closed. The company continued to manufacture loudspeakers for home theater and multimedia applications, as well as distribute other brands such as Sony and Marantz. Cambridge SoundWorks marketing also included catalog and internet sales, in addition to worldwide product distribution by partnerships with IBM, Gateway, and the parent company Creative Technology Ltd. Creative ordered Cambridge to reduce the number of products sold under its trademark.

It largely resembles the female of the far more common Bolivian squirrel monkey, though the latter lacks the black central back. This squirrel monkey has one of the most restricted geographical distributions for a primate, living in várzea forest in the confluence of the Japura and Solimões rivers. Its entire range is within the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve. It resides in the reserve with two other Saimiri species. It is a social primate that travels with other black squirrel monkeys in large troops within its habitat. Its small size makes it an easy target for its predators; however, it may resist predators when it travels in large troops. Its species overall has positive effects on the economy. == Description == Black squirrel monkeys are small primates. They have blackish-gray fur over most of their body except for their legs and stomach. Their legs can be yellow or have a reddish tint. Their stomachs will have a yellow tint. They have short and dense fur everywhere except for certain areas on the face. They lack hair in the areas of the nostrils and lips, and the skin is black in these areas. Black squirrel monkeys tend to be 27 to 32 centimeters in length not including the length of their tails. Their full length, including their tails, can be about 40 centimeters longer than their length without their tails. Male black squirrel monkeys range in weight anywhere from 1.4 to 2.7 pounds. Female black squirrel monkeys have a weight range of 1.4 to 1.9 pounds. === Distinctive characteristics === They get their name from the strip of black that extends from their head to the end of their tail. The black fur above their eyes forms a shallow arch and is lower on their foreheads than other species. Their tails are specifically distinct from the Saimiri sciureus species because black squirrel monkeys have much thinner tails. === Lifespan === On average, black squirrel monkeys live up to 15 years in their natural habitat, the várzea forest. They can live about 5 to 10 years longer than that when they are kept in captivity. == Taxonomy == The black squirrel monkey falls under the genus, Saimiri. There are four other species that fall under this same genus with the black squirrel monkey. * Saimiri boliviensis * Saimiri oerstedti * Saimiri ustus * Saimiri sciureus UCLA scientists and colleagues concluded that black squirrel monkeys are a distinct species of Saimiri when it was originally considered the same species as Saimiri boliviensis. == Habitat == Black squirrel monkeys reside within the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve in Brazil. The várzea forest of this specific area experiences a consistent cycle of flooding. The patterns of rain can cause a typical buildup of around 35 feet of flooding in the forest. Atypical flooding due to excessive floods over a longer amount of time can threaten black squirrel monkeys' habitat. === Observations === Two Saimiri subspecies of sciureus, cassiquiarensis and macrodon, take residence in the reserve in cohabitation with black squirrel monkeys. The black squirrel monkeys inhabit a smaller ranged area than the other two species within the reserve. All three species interact with one another but sexual interaction and reproduction between two different species has not been observed. === Vulnerability === The black squirrel monkey species is declared vulnerable because of their limited range in the várzea forest. The change in climate due to global warming is also affecting the lives of the black squirrel monkey species. == Temperament == They are interactive primates. They exist in large groups of 40–50, and can exist in groups as large as 500 monkeys. Travelling in big groups allows these monkeys to resist their predators more effectively. They have more eyes on their surroundings which allows them to more easily and quickly alert the pack if they sense danger. If the pack is big enough, the pack may be able to surround certain predators. === Communication === Black squirrel monkeys are typically quiet primates. The only times they make noise are when they sense danger or are trying to call out to other members of their group. === Reproduction === Breeding season falls between the months of September and November. During this season, the male monkeys with fattened stomachs are desired more by the female monkeys. A female monkey's pregnancy will last about 140 to 170 days, and the time of birth falls at the same time that rainfall and food availability are at their peaks. == Ecological role == === Predators === * snakes * raptors * felids === Prey === Black squirrel monkeys are omnivores. They have preferences for fruit and insects, but if those sources of food are unavailable, other options may take their place such as: * leaves * flowers * seeds * eggs * small vertebrae == Economic importance == Black squirrel monkeys have a positive effect on the economy by serving as subjects of biomedical research, being sold to serve as an individual's pet, and serving as a source of food. There are no negative impacts of the species on the economy because of the species' small habitation range that they occupy. == Gallery == File:Saimiri vanzolinii Mamiraua.jpg File:O mico-de- cheiro.jpg File:Saimiri vanzolinii.jpg File:Flickr - law keven - All along the Watchtower........jpg File:Flickr - law keven - I've got a Monkey on my back......jpg ==References== ==External links== *Information about the geographical distribution of the Black Squirrel Monkey on Natureserve.com Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Mammals described in 1985 Category:Squirrel monkeys Category:Primates of South America Category:Taxa named by José Márcio Ayres ","title":"Black squirrel monkey"},{"id":"3229344","text":"John Sampen (born 1949) is an American classical saxophonist.

This series places more focus on Astro's robotic abilities and has a darker story line than previous incarnations of the series. The English dubs cut out some of the series more violent moments, such as Astro being beheaded in the episode Lilly on Peligro Island and Blackie Young and his crew destroying the robot guard and factory owner in the episode Blackie Young. The original Japanese version of the series ran for 52 color episodes while the English dubs (American and Canadian) ran for 51 episodes as the first two were combined into one omitting the entirety of the backstory of themain antagonist Atlas. Because of this, episode fours title Atlas Lives Again, does not make sense. As well as that, during the episode when Astro meets Atlas in the latters underwater base, Astro recognises him, refers to him by name and remembers their fight on the iceberg from episode two. This indicates that everything that was cut out to make the first two episodes into one still happened despite not being shown. ==Plot== The first episode takes place in the year 2030 in Tokyo, Japan. Dr. Tenma, the Minister of Science, is attempting to create a robot capable of expressing human emotions. After his fourth failed attempt, Tenma is approached by Skunk Kusai, a man who offers him an \\"Omega Factor\\" circuit which, when installed, will humanize a robot. After rejecting Skunk's offer and throwing him out, Tenma's nine-year-old son, Tobio, suggests his father make a robot shaped like a child. Inspired by his son, Tenma sets off to the Ministry of Science to work, forgetting his promise to take Tobio to an amusement park. Upset by his father's neglect, Tobio drives an aerocar home but crashes into an oncoming truck, dying in the process. Just before he dies, Tobio makes his father promise to name his boy robot \\"Tobio\\" and make it the strongest robot in the world, while still loving it like a son. Tenma then creates a robot capable of flight, equipped with lasers and machine guns. However, Skunk obtains the blueprints, duplicates them, and takes them to the evil Count Walpurgis, who aspires to put the Omega Factor into a super robot and use it for world domination. Afraid of the potential threat Tenma's robot son could pose to humanity, the Prime Minister of Japan orders the robot dismantled by the next night. Tenma, however, secretly finishes constructing the robot that night, only showing his two assistants that \\"Tobio\\" exists, and takes him home to raise him. After various mishaps with raising the robot, Tobio's mind suddenly goes blank, his eyes start blinking red, and he is summoned to wait in the middle of town. Atlas, Walpurgis' new super robot, had been activated and was connecting to Tobio. When the connection process fails, Tobio regains his senses, only to come under attack from a robot disposal tank piloted by Tenma, Honda, and Ushiyama. Something goes wrong and the tank malfunctions and goes berserk. Tobio recovers and saves everyone in the vicinity. Recovering in the hospital, Tenma realizes the public will discover that Tobio exists, and decides to take Tobio on an ocean cruise to America. Tobio struggles to control his strength. After a disastrous meal on the cruise, Tenma disowns Tobio. Tobio hides on deck and is tricked into signing himself into a contract of slavery to the ringmaster Hamegg, who runs the Robot Circus. Tobio spots Atlas nearby and tries to attack him, but Tobio loses most of his energy in the process. Hamegg then shuts him in his suitcase. Tenma soon regrets his actions and begins searching for Tobio. At the circus, Tobio is renamed \\"Mighty Atom/Astro Boy\\" and is cruelly treated by Hamegg, but taught and cared for by a performer named Kathy, who shows him kindness and compassion. Professor Ochanomizu, a local scientist, discovers Tenma's lost robot at the circus and, with Kathy's help, smuggles Astro Boy out of the circus. Professor Ochanomizu becomes the new head of the Ministry of Science. From there, Astro Boy learns more about the world and becomes the defender of Tokyo and beyond. ==Characters== ===Atom/Astro Boy=== Astro has a strong sense of morality and is always gentle and kind towards others. Astro is a superpowered robot, with seven secret super powers.Astro Boy: The Greatest Robot in the World - Part 1 He is designed to look exactly like Tobio, the son of his creator. Dr. Tenma initially treated Astro like a real boy as a replacement for his son who died in a car accident. However, Astro Boy was clumsy from his inability to control his strength. After being rejected by Dr. Tenma, Astro joins Hamegg's Robot Circus, where he learns to control his powers and meets Dr. Ochanomizu. He is unsure of his destiny in the beginning, but he gains confidence as the story unfolds. Throughout the series, Atlas attempts to persuade Astro to help Atlas conquer the world. By design, both Astro and Atlas were created from the same blueprints, and so they are considered to be brothers. However, Astro refuses to help Atlas in his quest for world domination. He is voiced by Mari Shimizu, Patricia Kugler Whitely (American version) and then-12-year-old Steven Bednarski (Canadian version). ===Uran/Zoran=== *Sarah (Canadian dub), Uranie (French dub) Uran is Astro's naive but determined little sister. She was \\"born\\" on New Years Day, built by Dr. Ochanomizu as a gift to Astro. She has half the power of her brother (with 50,000 horsepower) but is quite powerful. Uran is depicted as a cute, tomboyish little girl. Despite this, Uran is generally a good-hearted girl and is shown to be rather attached to Astro and generally looks up to him. (this is shown after he saves her from becoming a slave in episode 14.) In contrast to the 1960s series, Uran occupied a less prominent position in the general storyline, and her appearance was revised to make her softer and rounder, possibly to appeal to female viewers. Many times, she was the star of a few episodes, all of which had a special ending theme with pictures of Uran in costumes. Uran is voiced by Masako Sugaya in the Japanese dub and by Becke Wilenski in the American version. ===Doctor Tenma/Dr.Boynton=== *Doctor Boynton (American dub), Professor Balfus (Canadian dub) After several robot design failures, Dr. Tenma created Astro Boy from a suggestion from his son, Tobio. Dr. Tenma zealously worked on creating a robot that would be able to act and behave like a real human. In his search to obtain his goal, Dr. Tenma neglected Tobio, forgetting his promise to take his son to the amusement park. As a result, Tobio decides to go on his own and crashes the robot car, dying from the accident. Dr. Tenma continues to work on the boy robot. Once completed, he calls the robot Tobio (Astro Boy), after his son. However, Astro Boy's inability to control his own strength begins to infuriate Dr. Tenma, and while on a cruise, Dr. Tenma angrily disowns the robot. Dr. Tenma is last seen mournfully calling out for Tobio, and is not seen through the remainder of the series.Astro Boy: The Birth of Astro Boy He is voiced by Tamio Ōki, and Del Lewis (American version). ===Professor Ochanomizu/Dr. Elefun=== *Dr. Elefun (American dub), Dr. Cole Green, later Professor Peabody (Canadian Dub), Professor Caudrine (French dub) Succeeding Dr. Tenma as Minister of Science, Dr. Ochanomizu rescues Astro Boy from Hamegg's Robot Circus. Dr. Ochanomizu is a robot rights advocate and creates the \\"Robot Bill of Rights\\", which allows robots to be of equal status of humans. He often acts as a surrogate father for Astro Boy, providing him with advice and information. Early into the series, Dr. Ochanomizu builds Astro a mother, father, and a little sister named Uran. He is voiced by Hisashi Katsuta and Brian Parry (American version). ===Atlas=== Astro's brother and archenemy, he was created by Walpurgis and Skunk who copied Astro's original design plans. Atlas was designed with a similar, childlike look and was planned to be used in theft, but Atlas was too naive and unprepared for criminal use. Only Livian, Walpurgis' robot maid, showed him any kind of compassion or kindness; he reciprocates in turn, considering her his only true friend. Walpurgis installed an Omega Factor into Atlas during his construction, which allowed him to defy the robot laws. After attacking Walpurgis and Skunk for destroying Livian and being heavily damaged himself, he rebuilt his own body and Livian's, along with a horse and an electric sword. The new Atlas believed robots were superior to human beings and repeatedly asked Astro to join him in taking over the world. Atlas and Astro share many of the same powers and abilities. The new Atlas and Livian are adult in appearance. Over the course of the series, Atlas gained a floating crystal castle. He dealt with Skunk and then Walpurgis, whom he killed off for good after his creator blackmailed him to use a powerful destructive cannon by planting a bomb in Livian's body as a fail-safe. However, Livian escaped from Walpurgis' grasp and Atlas pulverized him alongside his Castle after retrieving Livian. Later, Atlas sacrifices himself and Livian to save Earth from alien invaders. He is voiced by Katsuji Mori and Paul Nelson (American version). ===Higeoyaji/Daddy Walrus/Wally Kisagari=== *Victor (later Percival) Pompous (American dub, first animated series) Daddy Walrus (American dub, second animated series), Max McNugget (Canadian dub), Monsieur Morse (French dub) Real name Shunsaku Ban (Albert Duncan in the American dub), Daddy Walrus is Astro's teacher. Throughout the series, Mr. Pompous/Daddy Walrus is portrayed as a judo expert, an efficient private eye, and a keen flower arranger. As a trained martial artist, a recurring joke is Pompous reacting in terror when confronted but instantly rallying courage and \\"polishing off\\" an adversary twice his size. A sharp advocate for Robotic rights, he is one of Astro's strongest supporters, and frequently engages in vitriolic arguments with the formidable Inspector Gumshoe. While loud, brash, and comically short- tempered, Pompous/Daddy Walrus regards Astro and Uran with genuine affection and would willingly risk his life on their behalf. He is voiced by Kazuo Kumakura and Bob Gonzalez (American dub). ===Livian=== *Selena (Canadian dub), Vivian (French dub) Livian was formerly Walpurgis' robot maid, who befriended the young Atlas and took care of him. She was destroyed for accidentally breaking a decorative gargoyle and, as a result, Atlas went hysterical and attacked Walpurgis. Atlas rebuilt Livian and himself as adult robots, making Livian look like a princess. She is the only person to show compassion to Atlas and, in turn, he never harms her. Livian once leaves his crystal castle to warn Astro about Atlas's plans, and later tells Astro that he and Atlas are brothers. She is voiced by Keiko Yokozawa and Becky Wilenski (American version). ===Jump=== *Blip (Canadian dub), Plume (French dub) Jump is a yellow dog with brown patches and the pet dog of Tobio. Jump was loyal to his master and rushed to the scene after Tobio crashed the car and died. When Astro was first introduced to Jump, Jump was afraid and didn't like him. It is unknown how Dr. Ochanomizu found him, but when Astro visits his new home and parents for the first time, Jump is also with them. Jump grows to like Astro and his family, though Uran does not have the same amount of respect for Jump that Astro has. ===Skunk Kusai=== *Slippery (Canadian dub), Sirius (French dub) An enigmatic thief and mob leader in Tokyo, known for his blue skin and bloodhound eyes. In the beginning of the series, he works with Walpurgis in order to copy Astro's design blueprints. Skunk was assigned to teach Atlas, but, after becoming frustrated with him, the majority of the teaching was done by Livian. After Skunk set up Astro and Atlas's first battle, Walpurgis destroyed Livian, and Skunk just barely got away from Atlas's hysterical backlash. Skunk went to Tokyo and started up a gang, whom briefly used the adult Atlas to commit several robberies when Atlas returned. Throughout the rest of the series, Skunk utilizes various robots for his own doings, most famously in the episode \\"The Light Ray Robot\\". He develops a strong hate for Astro because of the boy's constant interference with Skunk's work. At times, the latter tries to destroy or taunt him. He is voiced by Seizō Katō and Jay Rath (American version). ===Tobio Tenma=== *Toby Boynton (American dub) A nine-year-old boy who is the son of Doctor Tenma who was fatally wounded in a car accident. After being neglected by his father, he goes in his car alone and crashes into an oncoming truck. Whilst on his deathbed at the Tokyo hospital, he tells his father to create a robot who looks like him and raise him like a son. He dies in his father's arms after speaking his last words. He is voiced by Mari Shimizu, Patricia Kugler Whitely (American version) and Steven Bednarski (Canadian version). ===Others=== *Astro's Dad – *Astro's Mom – *Detective Tawashi/Inspector Gumshoe – *Detective Nakamura/Chief McLaw – *Kenichi/Kenneth – One of Astro's classmates. *Shibugaki/Alvin – One of Astro's classmates. *Tamao/Theodore – One of Astro's classmates. *Midori/Mindy – One of Astro's classmates. *Sultan/Saltan – *Ham Egg – *Black Jack/Dr. Roget – *Pinoco/Penny – *Rock – ==Broadcast and release== There are two different English-language dubs. The first was coordinated by Tezuka Productions and Nippon TV and dubbed in 1982, which aired in Australia from 1983 to 1998. It had a very limited release in the U.S., where broadcasts were limited to syndication in a few markets, such as the Philadelphia-Wilmington area where it aired at 10:30am weekdays in 1986 on what was then WTGI—channel 61.TV Guide Vol. 34 No. 37/ September 13, 1986/ Issue # 1746 (Philadelphia Edition) Pages A-22, A-86, A-114, A-137, A-159, A-180 Triangle Publications, Inc. (1986) This is the version that was later released on DVD in both Australia and the United States. The second English dub was heavily edited and redubbed in Canada in 1985, solely for broadcast there. In the Canadian version, most of the characters had different names from their American counterparts. Due to laws which required a specific amount of Canadian content, the Canadian version also featured a pre-title sequence which recapped Astro's origin, and an epilogue where Astro would give a brief report about each episode's adventure to a computer named Geronimo. Astro's report would always contain a minor error about the story, and a narrator would encourage the viewers to find Astro's mistake, and compare answers with their friends. In India, the Hindi-dubbed version of this show was broadcast on Pogo from 2008 to 2009. The aforementioned first dub of the 1980 series has since been released on DVD by Madman Entertainment and Manga Entertainment, although there are differences between the Madman and Manga Entertainment sets. Madman's set contains more deleted scenes, as well as the first two episodes, unedited (in Japanese with English subtitles). The Manga Entertainment set has a newly edited Japanese language track to go with the U.S. version of the first episode. As of March 2012, the Manga set is now out of print. The series premiered in Jamaica on CVM Television on March 16, 2017. ===The \\"lost\\" episode=== The first two episodes of the series were edited into one episode, completely removing the subplot of Atlas's origin. The two episodes are available in their complete state, in Japanese-with-subtitles only, on the Madman Entertainment DVD release. The two individual episodes (along with the other 50) can also be legally seen online in most countries with crowd-sourced subtitles on Viki. ==References== ==External links== *Astro-Boy.net *Astro Boy 1980 anime at TezukaOsamu@World * * * Category:Astro Boy Category:1980 anime television series Category:Japanese children's animated action television series Category:Japanese children's animated adventure television series Category:Japanese children's animated science fantasy television series Category:Japanese children's animated superhero television series Category:Androids in television Category:Ici Radio-Canada Télé original programming Category:Nippon TV original programming Category:Animated television series about robots Category:Osamu Tezuka anime Category:Television series set in the 2020s Category:Television series set in the future Category:Tezuka Productions Category:YTV (TV channel) original programming es:Astroboy ","title":"Astro Boy (1980 TV series)"},{"id":"3229348","text":"Stage Fright () is a 1987 Italian slasher film directed by Michael Soavi, and starring Barbara Cupisti, David Brandon, and Giovanni Lombardo Radice. The plot tells about a group of stage actors and crew locking themselves inside a theater for rehearsal of a musical production, unaware that an escaped mental patient has been locked inside with them. ==Plot== Late at night inside a theater, a troupe of actors and crew consisting of the director Peter, Alicia, Mark, Sybil, Betty, Corrine, Laurel, Danny, Brett, and Ferrari are rehearsing a musical about a fictional mass murderer known as the Night Owl. When Alicia sprains her ankle, she and Betty sneak out of rehearsal for medical assistance, the closest being a mental hospital. When speaking to the psychiatrist, Betty notices an imprisoned patient named Irving Wallace, a former actor gone insane who committed a killing spree. Unbeknownst to any of them, Wallace killed one of the attendants with a syringe and snuck out of the asylum to hide inside Betty's car. Upon returning, Peter fires Alicia for leaving during the rehearsal. Outside, Betty returns to the car only to be murdered by Wallace with a pickaxe to the mouth. Moments later, Alicia finds her body and contacts the police. The body is removed and two officers are stationed outside the premises. Meanwhile, Peter creates an idea by altering the play's script; he renames the show's antagonist to Irving Wallace instead of an ambiguous killer, and insists that everyone (including rehired Alicia) stay the night to begin immediate rehearsals with the new material. The group reluctantly agrees to stay with the promise of additional cash, and Corrine hides the theater's exit key. While changing her costume, Laurel is stalked by a shadowy figure who she thought to be Brett. Brett then stays behind to search for his costume, not noticing Wallace who's donning the theater's owl costume behind him. Peter shoots a scene with Corrine. Wallace appears in the owl costume and approaches Corinne before grabbing and strangling her, unbeknownst to the others. He pulls out a knife and stabs Corinne several times, killing her, while the others watch in shock. Without the key's whereabouts, the group begins to panic, and the killer disconnects the phone lines to prevent them from contacting the officers. While the group tries to find an escape route, Ferrari is stabbed by Wallace, who hangs his body upon being found by the group. While Peter and Danny leave the group inside a room to search for the killer, Laurel notices Wallace outside trying to open the door and the group barricades it. The killer then breaks the window to grab Mark before killing him with a power drill through the door. Peter and Danny return, and, upon witnessing Mark's murder, they plan to stick together and defend themselves. While the group moves on to the stage, Peter notices the killer up on the upper catwalks and goes after him, while asking the others to corner him too. Laurel leaves Alicia behind after accidentally knocking her out. Peter then hacks up the missing Brett (who is donning a similar owl costume and is unknowingly tied up) with an axe, thinking he was Wallace. Soon, Sybil is grabbed by the killer and is pulled into the floor. Danny and Peter grab her arms and try to pull her up, but, as a result, Sybil is torn in half. Danny immediately goes down and is also killed by Wallace with a chainsaw. Cornering Peter and Laurel, Wallace wounds Laurel and cuts off Peter's arm before the chainsaw runs out of fuel. The killer takes the axe and ultimately decapitates the director. Alicia wakes up and finds a wounded Laurel hiding in the shower room. While she hides, Wallace grabs Laurel and stabs her before dragging her body away. Alicia arms herself and searches for the key, only to see Wallace sitting next to the group's bodies placed around the stage and covered with feathers. Underneath the stage, she successfully finds the key and defends herself against Wallace before going up to the catwalks. Just as Wallace corners her, she sprays a fire extinguisher into his face, knocking him over and leaving him hanging onto a loose cable. After the cable is severed and the killer falls, Alicia makes her way to the door, but Wallace attacks again. She dumps a burning bin onto him, igniting him, then escapes the theater and tells the police about the events. The next morning, Alicia returns to the theater to find her missing watch, just before an unmasked Wallace prepares to attack her. Willy shoots him in the head and he rambles about getting him \\"right in-between in the eyes\\" while a disturbed Alicia walks out. Wallace then looks at the camera and smirks, apparently having survived from his headshot. ==Cast== * Barbara Cupisti as Alicia * David Brandon as Peter * Mary Sellers as Laurel * Robert Gligorov as Danny * Jo Ann Smith as Sybil * Giovanni Lombardo Radice as Brett * Martin Philips as Mark * Piero Vida as Ferrari * Loredana Parrella as Corinne * Ulrike Schwerk as Betty * Domenico Fiore as Police Chief * Mickey Knox as Old Cop * Michele Soavi as Young Cop * James Sampson as Willy (as James E.

Sathariel (Hebrew סתריאל, Greek: Σαθιήλ) is one of the Qliphoth, corresponding to the Sephirah Binah on the kabbalistic Tree of life. It represents the Concealment of God, which hides the face of Mercy. The form of the demons attached to this Qliphah are of black veiled heads with horns, with hideous eyes seen through the veil, followed by evil centaurs. The Qliphoth are the shadow of the Sephirot, the chaotic force that exists when the Sephirah is unbalanced. Binah is the Sephirah that gives birth to form, the great mother of the cosmos, the eternal womb. Through her, the spiritual energy of Keter and Chokmah are woven into the matrix that eventually becomes matter. But when this force is unbalanced, then the spiritual principle is hidden, matter is taken to be simply matter, and is not understood to be simply condensed energy, which is crudified spirit. Binah, the giver of form, becomes Sathariel, the concealer of spirit. Sathariel is described in the Book of Enoch as the 17th Watcher of the 20 leaders of the 200 fallen angels. The name is believed to be of Babylonian origin and a combination of shetar and el (God) with the name meaning \\"side of God\\". Michael KnibbThe Ethiopic Book Of Enoch. Knibb, Michael A., Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978, repr. 1982. believes the name to mean \\"Moon of God\\" or \\"Dawn of God\\" based on the Ge'ez copies of the Book of Enoch. The cortex or outer shell of Sathariel is called the order of Sheireil, \\"The Hairy Ones of God\\". This demonic order has been describedThomas Karlsson: Qabalah, Qliphoth and Goetic Magic (English title, ). as a black labyrinth of chaotic riddles, where Lucifuge reigns. The magician's third eye is opened and darkness becomes light if ascension progresses through this order. This results in the magician learning to see the light of Lucifer and becoming clairvoyant. In qliphotic kabbalah, Sathariel is the third qliphah after Thamiel and Chaigidel. Sathariel is directly connected to Thamiel, Chaigidel, Da'at, Gamchicoth and Golachab. These connections are described as gateways or tunnels, similar to the paths between the sephiras. == See also == * The Temple of the Black Light == References == Category:Watchers (angels) Category:Qliphoth Category:Kabbalistic words and phrases ","title":"Sathariel"},{"id":"3229366","text":"The Stuart River or Nak'alkoh (Dakelh name) is one of the largest tributaries of the Nechako River in northeastern British Columbia, Canada. The Nechako is in turn one the more important tributaries of the Fraser River. The Stuart River flows from Stuart Lake to its junction with the Nechako River. The river drains a portion of the Nechako Plateau—a gently-rolling region characterized by small lakes and tributaries. Low but impressive ridges interact with the river, creating high bluffs and hoodoos. The Stuart River's watershed is the northernmost part of the Fraser River's drainage basin. Although the Stuart River itself begins at the south end of Stuart Lake there are many additional rivers and lakes in the watershed. Far to the north the Sakeniche River and Driftwood River flow into Takla Lake, which empties into the Middle River, which in turn flows to Trembleur Lake. The Tachie River flows south from Trembleur Lake to Stuart Lake. a journey of at least .Moon books British Columbia The river has been named as one of twenty British Columbia heritage rivers. ==Course== The Stuart River begins at the south end of Stuart Lake near Fort St. James and the Necoslie Indian Reserve. The Necoslie River joins the river just as it exits Stuart Lake. The Stuart River flows generally south and east for , collecting numerous small tributary streams. It turns to flow more directly south near its confluence with the Nechako River.Topographic maps via TopoQuest. ==History== The Stuart River is part of the traditional Dakelh (Carrier) territory. The entire area lies within the traditional territory of the Nak'azdli First Nation of Fort St. James and the Saik'uz First Nation of Stoney Creek. According to oral tradition Chinlac, an important Dakelh village on the Stuart River, was destroyed around 1745 by Tsilhqot'in raiders from Nazko. Chinlac is a provincially significant archaeological site. The Stuart River is important in British Columbia history, having been the conduit for Simon Fraser's expedition down the Fraser River to present-day Vancouver in 1808. It was first ascended by Fraser's assistant, James McDougall, in 1806. The river and the lake it drains are named for another of Fraser's assistants, John Stuart, who accompanied Simon Fraser when he ascended the Stuart River in 1806 and established Fort St. James at Stuart Lake. In 1809 Stuart succeeded Fraser in the command of the New Caledonia district. During the Omineca Gold Rush, steamboats ran on the river from the Quesnel area on the Fraser River to Stuart Lake. ==Natural history== The Stuart River's watershed is forested with lodgepole pine, spruce, cottonwood, aspen, Douglas fir, and some birch. Understory trees include willow, dogwood, and alder. There are also open grassy hills with dwarf juniper and open, park-like stands of aspen and spruce. The area provides deer, moose, and elk with winter ranges and riparian feeding areas. A small elk herd lives in the area. Trumpeter swans winter along the upper Stuart. The river supports sturgeon and one of the highest-quality wild sockeye salmon runs in the world. In some years, up to one million sockeye salmon migrate up the river system to the spawning grounds in tributary streams and rivers north of Stuart Lake. ==See also== *List of tributaries of the Fraser River *List of British Columbia rivers *Steamboats of the Upper Fraser River in British Columbia ==References== Category:Rivers of British Columbia Category:Tributaries of the Fraser River ","title":"Stuart River (Canada)"},{"id":"3229368","text":"Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National Park is a national park located in Jubilee Hills and Banjara Hills in Hyderabad, Telangana, India.

The Times of India, 9 July 2010. ==National park status== The entire palace complex area was declared as a National park by the Andhra Pradesh state government after getting permission from the central government in the year 1998. This gave control of the major part of the land to the forest department and the Nizam was left with the control of only about 11 acres. As time passed the control of the Nizam was further reduced to the present less than six acres. Further the park was renamed to Kasu Brahmananda Reddy National Park with only the palace building being referred to as Chiran palace. In June 2010 the Prince and his representatives reached an agreement with the state government to exchange Chiran Palace and 16 other pieces of his property scattered over the national park with six acres of land on the north- west corner of the park. This land would not be considered the part of the National park and thus will not provide access to forest officials and visitors to the park. All the properties on the land, including the Chiran palace, would be notified as part of the national park and the land to be handed out to the prince was struck out of the park. This agreement received the approval of The Indian Board of Wildlife, Supreme Court, and the central government. ==The Palace== The Chiran Palace, unlike the other palaces of the Nizam like Falaknuma or Chowmahalla, is a modern facility designed to serve the needs of the prince. It is not a palace in the traditional sense of the term. It is more like a big villa constructed on 6,000 sq meters of land. The duplex type palace has two cellars where the prince had his billiard room along with a large conference hall. The ground floor contains an armory hall, two guest rooms in addition to his office, a place for visitors, pantry and kitchen etc. The first floor comprises seven bedrooms where the Nizam lived with his wife and children. ==The Park== The park provides an excellent lung space and environment from the busy city life and rising pollution levels. The park has over 600 species of plant life, 140 species of birds and 30 different varieties of butterflies and reptiles. Some of the animals making their home in the park include: pangolin, small Indian civet, peacock, jungle cat and porcupines. There are few water bodies present in the park providing the needed moisture for the plants and quenching the thirst of birds and small animals.http://www.ourhyd.com/kbrpark.html One can commute to KBR Park through nearest Metro station at Jubilee Hills Check Post or nearest MMTS station which is at Begumpet or Metro station at Jubilee hills checkpost.

It is spread over 820 km2., and three districts of Uttarakhand: Haridwar, Dehradun and Pauri Garhwal. In 1983, three wildlife sanctuaries in the area namely, Chilla, Motichur and Rajaji sanctuaries were merged into one.Rajaji Official website of Haridwar. Rajaji National Park has been named after C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji), a prominent leader of the Freedom Struggle, the second and last Governor-General of independent India and one of the first recipients of India's highest civilian award Bharat Ratna (in 1954). == Tiger reserve status == The Union government has given the nod to a proposal to grant the Rajaji National Park in Uttarakhand the status of a tiger reserve. It will be the second tiger reserve in the state after the Corbett Tiger Reserve and 48th Tiger Reserve of India. As per directions of the Tiger Conservative Authority of India, the Rajaji National Park will be core area of the Rajaji Tiger Reserve, while about 300 km2. of Shyampur range of the Haridwar forest division and parts of Kotdwar and Laldhang forest division, which function as a buffer zone, will also be included in the Tiger Project, augmented area to 1150 km2. Final approval was accorded to Kudremukh (Karnataka) and Rajaji (Uttarakhand) for declaring as a tiger reserve in 15 April 2015.https://www.rajajitigerreserve.org.in/rajaji-national-park.php Rajaji became the second tiger reserve in Uttarakhand.http://hillpost.in/2015/04/rajaji-becomes-second-tiger-reserve-in- uttarakhand/103025/ == Flora == File:THE INDIAN JUNGLE.jpg Rajaji National Park of India is nestled between the Shivalik ranges and the Indo-Gangetic plains. Broadleaved deciduous forests, riverine vegetation, scrubland, grasslands and pine forests form the range of flora in this park. The dense jungles here are home to vivacious wildlife. The varied topography of the national park is also responsible for vivid animal life inhibited here. The under-wood is light and often absent, consisting of rohini Mallotus philippensis, amaltas Cassia fistula, shisham Dalbergia sissoo, Sal Shorea robusta, palash Butea monosperma, arjun Terminalia arjuna, khair Senegalia catechu, baans Dendrocalamus strictus, semul Bombax ceiba, sandan, chamaror Ehretia, amla Phyllanthus emblica, kachnar Bauhienia variegata, ber Ziziphus mauritiana, chilla Casearia, bel Aegle marmelos, etc. == Fauna == Rajaji National Park is predominantly formed from dense green jungles, and this environment forms a habitat for a number of animals. The park is at the northwestern limit of distribution for both elephants and tigers in India. The park is most renowned for its elephants. The mountain goat, goral is another noteworthy resident. It is mainly confined to the precipitous pine-covered slopes. Besides the huge pachyderms and the nimble goats, you might come across huge herds of chital, sometimes as many as 250 to a herd. sambar, barking deer, hog deer, nilgai, wild pigs and sloth bears also inhabit these forests though you may not always catch a glimpse of these. The rhesus macaque and the common langur are fairly common here. Tigers and leopards are the prime predators in Rajaji. The leopard cat, jungle cat, civet and yellow- throated marten are other carnivores. Mammals like the hyena, jackal and the Bengal fox scavenge in the park. The Himalayan black bear though uncommon, can be sighted in the higher reaches of the park. Other wild animals found in the park include: * Asian elephant * Bengal tiger * Indian Leopard * Jungle cat * Striped hyena * Goral * Indian hare * Sloth bear * Himalayan black bear * King cobra * Jackal * Barking deer * Sambhar * Wild boar * Rhesus macaque * Indian langur * Indian porcupine * Monitor lizard * Python Over 315 species of birds are found in the park, whereas the wider region has over 500 species of birds, including both residents and migrants. The most prominent avian species include pea fowl, vultures, woodpeckers, pheasants, kingfishers and barbets, supplemented by a number of migratory species during the winter months. The park is also home to the great pied hornbill, pied kingfisher and the fire tailed sunbird. This area is the first staging ground after the migratory birds cross over the Himalayas into the Indian subcontinent. The rivers which flow through the park harbour species of fish such as trout and mahseer. ==Access== The park has several gates, and is accessible from many cities in Uttrakhand e.g. Dehradun, Kotdwar, Haridwar and Rishikesh. Saharanpur, which is linked by train to other parts of India, is another popular point to reach the Mohand area of the park in nearly an hour by road. Lions are also found in some of villages nearby Rajaji National Park. ==Incidents== Rajaji National Park was in the news in April 2010 when a forest fire which started on the fringes of the park, spread out over a large area and threatened the Chandi Devi Temple.Article, NDTV.com, 10 April 2010. Their are also many leopards that are becoming man eaters because of which there are many man-animal conflict situations here. The buffer zone needs to be managed more cleverly so that it can at least contain leopards in the core. Elephants require a very large area and they may wander outside the area. Unfortunately, Rajaji is just outside the Indian city of Haridwar and their are many wild animals wandering in the city. ==References== Category:National parks in Uttarakhand Category:Memorials to C.

It lives in the Amazon Rainforest, and is found in the countries of Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. It has black hair covering its body, except for a reddish abdomen, tail, and upper limbs, and a bald face. It has highly specialised teeth which allow it to eat seeds and fruits with hard shells. The name golden-backed uakari is a neotype proposed by Boubli et al. (2008). == Taxonomy == The species Cacajao melanocephalus was previously named the black-headed uakari and two subspecies were thought to exist: Cacajao melanocephalus melanocephalus (black-backed uakari) and Cacajao melanocephalus ouakary (golden-backed uakari).Hershkovitz, P. (1987). Uacaris. New World monkeys of the genus Cacajao (Cebidae, Platyrrhini): a preliminary taxonomic review with a description of a new sub- species. American Journal of Primatology 12: 1-53. However, in 2008 a new black uakari was discovered and the species group was reassessed by Boubli et al. using morphological and molecular analyses. Cacajao melanocephalus ouakary was found to be a junior synonym of Cacajao melanocephalus but its common name, golden-backed uakari, replaced the previous one, black-headed uakari. Cacajao melanocephalus melanocephalus was elevated to species status as Cacajao hosom (the Neblina uakari), and the new species was named Cacajao ayresi (Aracá uakari).Boubli, J. P., M. N. F. da Silva, M. V. Amado, T. Hrbek, F. B. Pontual, and I. P. Farias (2008). A taxonomic reassessment of black uakari monkeys, Cacajao melanocephalus group, Humboldt (1811), with the description of two new species. International Journal of Primatology 29: 723–749. In 2014 Ferrari et al proposed an alternative taxonomy which recognizes the Aracá uakari as a subspecies of the Golden-backed uakari, and also recognized Cacajao ouakary as a separate species from C. melanocephalus, but this revision is not universally accepted. ==Description== The golden- backed uakari is characterized by a black haired head, black hairless facial skin, black lower limbs and hands, black soles on hands and feet, and a reddish hued flank, tail, and upper limbs. They are noted for having a particularly short and non-prehensile tail and highly specialized teeth. Sexual dimorphism is present, with females being slightly smaller than the males, having a mass generally less than 3 kg compared to an overall species' mass ranging from 2.5 to 3.7 kg. ==Distribution== It is native to north- western Brazil, south-eastern Colombia and south-western Venezuela, living in the Amazon Rainforest, especially in the seasonally flooded forests called igapos. No boundaries have been identified between the habitats of the three subspecies. Uakaris are known to travel several kilometers with the changing season in pursuit of certain fruits.Barnett, A. A., C. Volkmar de Castilho, R. L. Shapley, A. Anicácio (2005). Diet, habitat selection and natural history of Cacajao melanocephalus ouakary in Jaú National Park, Brazil. International Journal of Primatology 26: 949–969. Black-headed uakaris have been sighted in varying habitats apart from the igapos, including terra firme, palm swamps, low open white sand forests, rain forests, and campinarana.Bezerra, B. M., A. A. Barnett, A. Souto, G. Jones (2011). Ethogram and natural history of golden- backed uakaris (Cacajao melanocephalus).International Journal of Primatology 32: 46–68. ==Diet== These uakaris mainly feed on seeds and fruits, but will also eat leaves, pith and insects. They have large canines that allow them to feed on seeds from fruits with hard shells and incisors that are able to shatter the husk for access to the inner seeds.Eaglen, R. H. (1984). Incisor size and diet revisited: the view from a platyrrhine perspective. American Journal of Physical Anthropology 64: 263-275. They are also known to consume fruits from many different species of trees. Overall, there is little competition with other primates for food, as most living in the same habitat do not devour hard fruits, however some competition with birds exist.Robinson, J. G., P.C. Wright, W. A. Kinzey (1987). Monogamous cebids and their relatives: intergroup calls and spacing. Pp. 44-53 in Primate Societies. University of Chicago Press, Illinois.Kinzey, W. G. (1992). Dietary and dental adaptation in the Pitheciinea. American Journal of Physical Anthropology 88: 499-514. Leaves are also consumed, especially when fruits are low during the dry season. Another dietary form observed is insectivory, peaking when fruit availability is low, through the consumption of fruit infested with insects or through the deliberate hunting of insects for protein. Uakaris have been seen raiding wasp nests for larvae and even eating the eggs of river turtles. ==Behavior== They typically live in groups of 5-40 individuals, but occasionally more than 100 may come together. Individuals within a subgroup exist in close proximity and interact frequently. The uakari are diurnal. They move around by walking and running on all fours and even climbing and galloping. Leaping is the main method of travel, allowing them to cover a distance of 10 meters in one leap. Swimming is done only when required, as when they accidentally fall into the water. Newborn infants range from 25% to 67% of the mother's body length. After birth, the infants follow the mother for a year and a half, being carried on her back or front side. ==References== ==External links== * Photo Primate.wisc.edu golden-backed uakari Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Mammals of Colombia Category:Mammals of Venezuela golden-backed uakari Category:Taxa named by Alexander von Humboldt ","title":"Golden-backed uakari"},{"id":"3229408","text":"In aviation meteorology, a trend type forecast (TTF), also known simply as a trend, is a weather forecast written by a person on location at a major airport or military base.

The story follows an unnamed narrator and his wife Ligeia, a beautiful and intelligent raven-haired woman. She falls ill, composes \\"The Conqueror Worm\\", and quotes lines attributed to Joseph Glanvill (which suggest that life is sustainable only through willpower) shortly before dying. After her death, the narrator marries the Lady Rowena. Rowena becomes ill and she dies as well. The distraught narrator stays with her body overnight and watches as Rowena slowly comes back from the dead – though she has transformed into Ligeia. The story may be the narrator's opium-induced hallucination and there is debate whether the story was a satire. After the story's first publication in The American Museum, it was heavily revised and reprinted throughout Poe's life. ==Plot summary== The story is told by an unnamed narrator who describes the qualities of Ligeia: a beautiful, passionate and intellectual woman, raven-haired and dark-eyed. He thinks he remembers meeting her \\"in some large, old decaying city near the Rhine.\\" He is unable to recall anything about the history of Ligeia, including her family's name, but remembers her beautiful appearance. Her beauty, however, is not conventional. He describes her as emaciated, with some \\"strangeness\\". He describes her face in detail, from her \\"faultless\\" forehead to the \\"divine orbs\\" of her eyes. They marry, and Ligeia impresses her husband with her immense knowledge of physical and mathematical science, and her proficiency in classical languages. She begins to show her husband her knowledge of metaphysical and \\"forbidden\\" wisdom. After an unspecified length of time Ligeia becomes ill, struggles internally with human mortality, and ultimately dies. The narrator, grief- stricken, buys and refurbishes an abbey in England. He soon enters into a loveless marriage with \\"the fair-haired and blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion, of Tremaine\\". In the second month of the marriage, Rowena begins to suffer from worsening anxiety and fever. One night, when she is about to faint, the narrator pours her a goblet of wine. Drugged with opium, he sees (or thinks he sees) drops of \\"a brilliant and ruby colored fluid\\" fall into the goblet. Her condition rapidly worsens, and a few days later she dies and her body is wrapped for burial. As the narrator keeps vigil overnight, he notices a brief return of color to Rowena's cheeks. She repeatedly shows signs of reviving, before relapsing into apparent death. As he attempts resuscitation, the revivals become progressively stronger, but the relapses more final. As dawn breaks, and the narrator is sitting emotionally exhausted from the night's struggle, the shrouded body revives once more, stands and walks into the middle of the room. When he touches the figure, its head bandages fall away to reveal masses of raven hair and dark eyes: Rowena has transformed into Ligeia. ==Analysis== Illustration by Byam Shaw, circa 1909 The narrator relies on Ligeia as if he were a child, looking on her with \\"child-like confidence\\". On her death, he is \\"a child groping benighted\\" with \\"childlike perversity\\". Poe biographer Kenneth Silverman notes that, despite this dependency on her, the narrator has a simultaneous desire to forget her, perhaps causing him to be unable to love Rowena. This desire to forget is exemplified in his inability to recall Ligeia's last name.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 139–140. The story tells us however that the narrator never knew her last name at all. Ligeia, the narrator tells us, is extremely intelligent, \\"such as I have never known in a woman\\". Most importantly, she served as the narrator's teacher in \\"metaphysical investigation\\", passing on \\"wisdom too divinely precious not to be forbidden!\\" So, her knowledge in mysticism, combined with an intense desire for life may have led to her revival. The opening epigraph, which is repeated in the body of the story, is attributed to Joseph Glanvill, though this quote has not been found in Glanvill's extant work. Poe may have fabricated the quote and attached Glanvill's name in order to associate with Glanvill's belief in witchcraft.Hoffman, Daniel. Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1972: 248. Ligeia and Rowena serve as aesthetic opposites:Kennedy, J. Gerald. Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1987: 83. Ligeia is raven- haired from a city by the Rhine while Rowena (believed to be named after the character in Ivanhoe) is a blonde Anglo-Saxon. This symbolic opposition implies the contrast between German and English romanticism.Kennedy, J. Gerald. \\"Poe, 'Ligeia,' and the Problem of Dying Women\\" collected in New Essays on Poe's Major Tales, edited by Kenneth Silverman. Cambridge University Press, 1993: 119–120. Exactly what Poe was trying to depict in the metamorphosis scene has been debated, fueled in part by one of Poe's personal letters in which he denies that Ligeia was reborn in Rowena's bodyKennedy, J. Gerald. \\"Poe, 'Ligeia,' and the Problem of Dying Women\\" collected in New Essays on Poe's Major Tales, edited by Kenneth Silverman. Cambridge University Press, 1993: 119. (a statement he later retracts). If Rowena had actually transformed into the dead Ligeia, it is only evidenced in the words of the narrator, leaving room to question its validity. The narrator has already been established as an opium addict, making him an unreliable narrator. The narrator early in the story describes Ligeia's beauty as \\"the radiance of an opium-dream\\". He also tells us that \\"in the excitement of my opium dreams, I would call aloud upon her name, during the silence of the night... as if... I could restore her to the pathway she had abandoned... upon the earth\\". This may be interpreted as evidence that Ligeia's return was nothing more than a drug-induced hallucination. If Ligeia's return from death is literal, however, it seems to stem from her assertion that a person dies only by a weak will. This implies, then, that a strong will can keep someone alive. It is unclear, however, if it is Ligeia's will or her husband's will that brings Ligeia back from the dead.Hoffman, Daniel. Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1972: 249. Her illness may have been consumption. The poem within the story, \\"The Conqueror Worm\\", also leads to some questioning of Ligeia's alleged resurrection. The poem essentially shows an admission of her own inevitable mortality. The inclusion of the bitter poem may have been meant to be ironic or a parody of the convention at the time, both in literature and in life. In the mid-19th century it was common to emphasize the sacredness of death and the beauty of dying (consider Charles Dickens's Little Johnny character in Our Mutual Friend or the death of Helen Burns in Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre). Instead, Ligeia speaks of fear personified in the \\"blood-red thing\\".Kennedy, J. Gerald. Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1987: 1–2. Other interpretations have been suggested however.Mabbott, T. O. Edgar Allan Poe: Complete Poems. University of Illinois Press, 2000. Poe's friend and fellow Southern writer Philip Pendleton Cooke suggested the story would have been more artistic if Rowena's possession by Ligeia was more gradual; Poe later agreed, though he had already used a slower possession in \\"Morella\\".Quinn, Arthur Hobson. Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biography. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998: 270–271. Poe also wrote that he should have had the Ligeia-possessed Rowena relapse back to her true self so that she could be entombed as Rowena, \\"the bodily alterations having gradually faded away\\".Quinn, Arthur Hobson. Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biography. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998: 271. However, in a subsequent letter he retracted this statement. ===As satire=== There has been some debate that Poe may have intended \\"Ligeia\\" to be a satire of Gothic fiction. The year that \\"Ligeia\\" was published, Poe published only two other prose pieces: \\"Siope—A Fable\\" and \\"The Psyche Zenobia\\", both Gothic-styled satires.Griffith, Clark. \\"Poe's 'Ligeia' and the English Romantics\\" in Twentieth Century Interpretations of Poe's Tales. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1971: 64. Supporting evidence for this theory includes the implication that Ligeia is from Germany, a main source of Gothic fiction in the 19th century, and that the description of her hints at much but says nothing, especially in the description of her eyes. The narrator describes their \\"expression\\", which he admits is a \\"word of no meaning\\". The story also suggests Ligeia is a transcendentalist, a group of people Poe often criticized.Griffith, Clark. \\"Poe's 'Ligeia' and the English Romantics\\" in Twentieth Century Interpretations of Poe's Tales. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1971: 66. ===Major themes=== *Death of a beautiful woman (see also: \\"Berenice\\", \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\", \\"Morella\\") *Resurrection (see also: \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\", \\"Morella\\", \\"Metzengerstein\\") *Substance abuse (see also: \\"The Black Cat\\", \\"Hop-Frog\\") ==Publication history== \\"Ligeia\\" was first published in the September 18, 1838, edition of the American Museum, a magazine edited by two of Poe's friends, Dr. Nathan C. Brooks and Dr. Joseph E. Snodgrass. The magazine paid Poe $10 for \\"Ligeia\\".Ostram, John Ward. \\"Poe's Literary Labors and Rewards\\" in Myths and Reality: The Mysterious Mr. Poe. Baltimore: The Edgar Allan Poe Society, 1987: 38. The story was extensively revised throughout its publication history. It was reprinted in Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque (1840), the one volume of Phantasy Pieces (1842), and Tales by Edgar Allan Poe (1845), the New World (February 15, 1845), and the Broadway Journal (September 27, 1845). The poem \\"The Conqueror Worm\\" was first incorporated into the text (as a poem composed by Ligeia) in the New World.Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 134. ==Critical reception== Charles Eames of The New World commented: \\"The force and boldness of the conception and the high artistic skill, with which the writer's purpose is wrought out, are equally admirable\\".Thomas, Dwight & David K. Jackson. The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe, 1809–1849. Boston: G. K. Hall & Co., 1987: 502. Thomas Dunn English, writing in the October 1845 Aristidean, said that \\"Ligeia\\" was \\"the most extraordinary, of its kind, of his productions\\".Thomas, Dwight & David K. Jackson. The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe, 1809–1849. Boston: G. K. Hall & Co., 1987: 586–587. Irish critic and playwright George Bernard Shaw said, \\"The story of the Lady Ligeia is not merely one of the wonders of literature: it is unparalleled and unapproached\\". ==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations== Roger Corman adapted the story into The Tomb of Ligeia in 1964. It would be the last of Corman's eight film adaptations of works by Edgar Allan Poe. Ligeia's theme of the death and resurrection of a beloved woman was subsequently developed by Alfred Hitchcock in Vertigo. The story has also recently been adapted into the 2008 independent feature originally known by the title Edgar Allan Poe's Ligeia but later renamed to The Tomb, by writer John Shirley and produced by Jeff Most, Donald P. Borchers. The film stars Wes Bentley, Michael Madsen, and Eric Roberts. ==References== ==External links== *Ligeia: A Study Guide * *\\"Ligeia\\" at The Fresh Reads Category:Short stories by Edgar Allan Poe Category:1838 short stories Category:Short stories adapted into films ","title":"Ligeia"},{"id":"3229507","text":"The black-faced lion tamarin or Superagüi lion tamarin (Leontopithecus caissara) is a small New World monkey of the family Callitrichidae. It is critically endangered and endemic to coastal forests in southeastern Brazil. There are several conservation projects and the total populations is unlikely to exceed 400 individuals. It is overall golden-orange with contrasting black head, legs and tail. == Discovery and distribution == The black-faced lion tamarin was not recognized until 1990 when two Brazilian researchers, Maria Lucia Lorini and Vanessa Persson, described it based on individuals from the island of Superagui in the Brazilian state of Paraná.Russell A. Mittermeier et al. Primates in Peril: The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates, 2004–2006 \\"Primate Conservation\\" 2006 Shortly after additional populations were discovered on the adjacent mainland in Paraná and in the far southern São Paulo.Kleiman, Devra G. and Jeremy J.C. Mallinson. (Feb. 1998). Recovery and Management Committees for Lion Tamarins: Partnerships in Conservation Planning and Implementation. Society for Conservation Biology. The specific name caissara is a reference to the caicaras, the local people of Superagui Island. Mainland populations prefer swampy and inundated secondary forest for habitat. The island population use mainly tall lowland forest and arboreal restinga (coastal forest on sandy soils) as primary habitat. Both populations strictly remain at altitudes below . == Behavior == The black-faced lion tamarin is an arboreal species and primarily eats small fruits and invertebrates such as insect, spiders and snails. They are also known to drink nectar, eat the young leaves of bromeliads and consume mushrooms. They are thought to supplement parts of their diet with mushrooms during the dry season. The black-faced lion tamarin lives in extended family groups with 2-8 members. Within these families there is normally only one breeding female per season. Births typically occur from September to March and females normally give birth to twins. Social interaction is a key component in maintaining a reproductive system such as this. Grooming is the most common form of affiliative behavior seen by the species specifically between the breeding pair.Gabriela Ludwig.

Agriculture, development, fragmentation and extraction of heart-of-palm are the leading causes for their habitat loss.Vivekananda, G. 2001. Parque Nacional do Superagui: A presença humana e os objetivos de conservação. Masters Thesis, Universidade Federal do Paraná. It is also threatened from the illegal pet trade, hunting, increased tourism and inbreeding depression. === Protection and conservation projects === The Superagüi lion tamarin is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, included on the Endangered Species Act and is listed on CITES Appendix I. Within Brazil, it is included on the national Official List of Species Threatened with ExtinctionLista Oficial de Espécies Brasileiras Ameaçadas de Extinção, Edict No. 1.522/19 December 1989, see Bernardes et al. 1990; Fonseca et al. 1994 and it is also on regional lists by both the Paraná and São Paulo states.Brazil, Paraná SEMA, 1995Brazil, São Paulo SMA, 1998 The Superagüi National Park covers most of the black-faced lion tamarin home ranges including Superagui Island and adjacent mainland parts of the state of Paraná. The national park is 33,988 hectares large and the black-faced lion tamarin is one of the endemic species that is used as a conservation unit for management of the park. The population in São Paulo is protected in the Jacupiranga State Park. The Instituto de Pesquisas Ecológicas (IPÊ) began the black-faced lion tamarin conservation program in 1996 and through 2004 focused on learning the ecology and natural history of the species. In 2005, enough data was collected to create the first conservation action plan for the black-faced lion tamarin and its habitat. As well as collecting additional data, from 2005 to 2007 IPÊ completed a diagnostic of threats to the survival of the species. They then hosted the first Eco- Negotiation Workshop in Ariri (São Paulo) in 2009, with a focus on education and awareness of sustainable production. Currently some of their objectives include evaluating dispersal of young, refine the projected population, observe the effects of sea rise due to climate change, and promote sustainable harvest of heart-of-palm. == References == == External links == black-faced lion tamari Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Critically endangered animals Category:Critically endangered biota of South America black-faced lion tamari ","title":"Superagüi lion tamarin"},{"id":"3229510","text":"\\"Cygnus X-1\\" is a two-part song series by Canadian progressive rock band Rush. The first part, \\"Book I: The Voyage\\", is the last song on the 1977 album A Farewell to Kings, and the second part, \\"Book II: Hemispheres\\", is the first song on the following album, 1978's Hemispheres. Book I is ten minutes and twenty-five seconds long (10:25), and Book II is eighteen minutes and seven seconds (18:07). It was released as a limited-edition extended play on April 22, 2017.‘CYGNUS X-1’ Record Store Day Exclusive ==General storyline== A black hole, known as Cygnus X-1 (an X-ray source believed to be an actual black hole), lies in the constellation Cygnus. An explorer aboard the spaceship Rocinante journeys toward the black hole, believing there may be something beyond it. As he moves closer, it becomes increasingly difficult to control the ship and he is eventually drawn in by the pull of gravity. The final words of Book I describe his ordeal: \\"Sound and fury drown my heart/Every nerve is torn apart.\\" The explorer re-enters the story midway through Book II. He has emerged into Olympus, where he witnesses the gods Apollo and Dionysus caught in the struggle between Mind and Heart. Prior to his arrival, the logical thinkers are led by Apollo and the emotional people are ruled by Dionysus. Apollo had shown the people how to build cities and explore the depths of science and knowledge, but Dionysus had lured many of them into the wild forests and provided love. However, his followers do not store any food for the winter and are caught unprepared. A conflict breaks out as the two different ways of life clash. When he reflects on what he sees, he becomes tormented in the lack of balance of the people who insist on one extreme or the other. His silent scream is felt by the warriors and causes them to rethink their struggle and unite. The gods recognize the explorer as a nascent new god and name him Cygnus, the God of Balance. ==Allusions and allegory== Although the storyline revolves around a science fiction world, it uses Greek mythology to explain the double meaning. \\"Cygnus X-1\\" is primarily about the discovery of two conflicting ways of life, and two vastly different ways in which the human mind thinks (logic and emotion are separated into separate sides, or hemispheres, of the brain). The balance point (Cygnus) allows the mind to think with some logic and emotion at the same time, allowing people to be analytical, but not unemotional. The name of the spaceship Rocinante is derived from the name of the title character's horse in the novel Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes. It was also the name of the camper truck John Steinbeck used while writing his book Travels with Charley. ==Sections== ===Book I: The Voyage=== \\"Prologue\\" This starts with a dissonant electronic soundscape and spoken introduction by album producer Terry Brown. Afterwards, a heavily syncopated bass riff in shifting time signatures (3/4, 7/8, 3/4, 4/4) fades in, with the full band joining in as the introductory sound effects fade out. \\"1\\" The shortest section of the song describes the black hole itself, and asks the question of what happens to someone who flies into it. \\"2\\" The protagonist sails into the black hole on board his \\"Rocinante\\". This section contains a wah-wah guitar solo by Alex Lifeson. \\"3\\" The climactic section of Book I uses a chord sequence first heard at 3:21 in the Prologue. The lyrics describe the \\"Rocinante\\" spinning out of control, and the protagonist's body being destroyed (\\"every nerve is torn apart\\"). This section includes the highest note sung by Geddy Lee on any studio album (B♭6 at 9:27). The song fades out with a repeated chord sequence – which returns at 11:56 in Book II – along with the sound of a beating heart. ===Book II: Hemispheres=== \\"Prelude\\" This section contains several themes heard later in the song, similar to the \\"Overture\\" in \\"2112.\\" \\"Apollo: Bringer of Wisdom\\" Apollo, the Greek god of the sun and the arts, represents the left hemisphere. 'Left- brainers' are often logical thinkers, adept at mathematics. \\"Dionysus: Bringer of Love\\" Dionysus, the Greek god of wine and fertility, represents the right hemisphere. He stood for uninhibited desire in Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy and Human, All Too Human and was the opposite of Apollo. 'Right-brainers' are more common than 'left-brainers,' and include people who are artistic and sensitive. \\"Armageddon: The Battle of Heart and Mind\\" The title is reference to the Biblical war, but in this case Apollo and Dionysus pull man in opposite directions, toward Order or Chaos, respectively. The debate between classical and romantic (Apollonian and Dionysian) cultures is ongoing. The left stereo channel switches to the right for dramatic effect when Lee sings the word 'hemispheres'. \\"Cygnus: Bringer of Balance\\" The chords played at the end of The Voyage return here. The explorer from The Voyage is frightened by the fighting and, after hearing the explorer's silent cry of terror, Apollo and Dionysus stop fighting and dub him Cygnus, god of Balance. \\"The Sphere: A Kind of Dream\\" Jane Austen's novel Sense and Sensibility may be alluded to in the last few lines of the song. ==Live performances== Rush performed the cycle (Book I followed by Book II) on the Hemispheres Tour and the Permanent Waves Tour. The band also played it on the Permanent Waves Warmup Tour, with the absence of Parts 2 (Apollo: Bringer of Wisdom) and 3 (Dionysus: Bringer of Love) from Book II. Book II: Prelude made a final appearance on the Counterparts Tour. Since then, an abbreviated version of book one was occasionally played live with only the instrumental section, as seen on Rush in Rio and R30. Occasionally, the \\"Prelude\\" from Book II was also performed. During the 2010-11 Time Machine Tour, the band played part of Book I at the conclusion of the final song, \\"Working Man.\\" During the 2015 R40 Tour, the \\"Prelude\\" section from Book II was played, but tuned a step down to accommodate Geddy Lee's vocal range, which has decreased with age. The Prologue and part 3 of Book I were played immediately after as instrumentals, with a drum solo by Neil Peart (\\"The Story So Far\\") as an interlude. ==See also== * List of Rush songs * Cygnus X-1 (astronomical object) * Apollonian and Dionysian ==References== Category:Rush (band) songs Category:1977 songs Category:1978 songs Category:Suites (music) Category:Greek mythology Category:Song recordings produced by Terry Brown (record producer) Category:Songs written by Neil Peart Category:Songs written by Geddy Lee Category:Songs written by Alex Lifeson ","title":"Cygnus X-1 (song series)"},{"id":"3229515","text":"Thagirion is the qliphah associated with the sephirah Tiferet in the kabbalistic Tree of life. It means the disputers, the painful movers, and the demons called the Zomiel are attributed to it, great black giants that are always working against each other. Tiferet is the sephirah of harmony, and the balance of different forces, which in particular balances the giving powers of Chesed, Loving kindness, with the restaining power of Geburah, restraint. Implicit in the idea of balancing and synthesis is also the idea of stress and strain, and the swinging backwards and forth between the different forces. Chesed and Geburah often work against each other, and the pendulum must be allowed to swing between them. If the pendulum is forced to stay still, in the middle, due to an excess of Tiferet, then undue stress and pain is felt, as these forces are not given room to breathe. Therefore Tiferet, beauty, becomes Thagirion, the disputers. Thagirion plays a role similar though inverse to that of Tiferet in the Tree of Life, in stopping the different forces from falling apart from each other, and maintaining the shape of the tree, although in the case of Thagirion, it maintains and sustains the ugly and evil forces together. Another important role of Tiferet is that of Saviour, and in Christian Kabbalah it is through Tiferet, the Son, that the father is known. Thagirion could be said to be the negative aspect of this dogma, the harsher doctrines that condemn all who dare defy their particular brand of beauty to everlasting hell and fire. ==References== Category:Qliphoth Category:Kabbalistic words and phrases ","title":"Thagirion"},{"id":"3229519","text":"The Tengger Desert (, ) is an arid natural region that covers about 36,700 km2 and is mostly in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in China.

From 1927 to 1931, he was a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and youth leader of the Socialist Worker Youth in Moers. In 1931, he switched to the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and joined the Communist Youth League of Germany (Kommunistischer Jugendverband Deutschlands; KJVD), becoming leader of the KJVD subdistrict of Duisburg-Hamborn. In 1933, after the Nazis had seized power, he was working illegally for the KPD and ended up in \\"protective custody\\" many times. From October 1933 until 1936, he was at Börgermoor and Esterwegen concentration camps, and until 1937 in pre-trial custody in Duisburg. He was sentenced by the Volksgerichtshof to one year and nine months in prison, released from custody, and banished from the Ruhr area. In April, Lemmnitz emigrated to the Netherlands, where he became a member of the KPD leadership in Amsterdam. After the Wehrmacht marched into the Netherlands, he was once again arrested and then sentenced by the Volksgerichtshof to ten years in labour prison (Zuchthaus). Until 1945, he was an inmate at the labour prison in Brandenburg-Görden. In 1946, Lemmnitz joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), took his studies up once again, graduating from the University of Leipzig in 1948. From 1948 to 1953, he held the chair for political economy at the Party College, and then until 1955, he was Professor of Political Economy and Dean of the Faculty of Economics at the University of Rostock. Until 1956, he was Rector of the College for Financial Science in Potsdam-Babelsberg, and until 1958, he held the same position at the Berlin College for Economics. In December 1958, he succeeded Fritz Lange as Minister for National Education, thereby also becoming a member of the Council of Ministers of the GDR and the Ideological Commission at the SED Central Committee's Politburo. In November 1963, he was succeeded by Margot Honecker, who would hold the post until 1989. From 1963 to 1965, he was a scientific associate at the Economic Institute of the Academy of Sciences, until 1971, Acting Director of the German Economic Institute, and finally Associate of the Institute for International Politics and Science.

The word bioshelter was coined by the New Alchemy Institute and solar designers Sean Wellesley-Miller and Day Chahroudi.Todd, N.J. and Todd J., 1994. From Eco- Cities to Living Machines - Principles of Ecological Design, North Atlantic Books, Berkeley, CA. The term was created to distinguish their work in greenhouse design and management from twentieth century petro-chemical fuelled monoculture greenhouses. New Alchemy's pioneering work in ecological design is documented in their published Journals and Reports. In 1976 the Alchemists built the Cape Cod Ark bioshelter and her sister The Prince Edward Island Ark. For the next 15 years the New Alchemy Institute studied and reported on the use of these prototype food producing ecosystems. A bioshelter (life-shelter) involves two fields of knowledge and design. The first is architecture designed to nurture an ecosystem within. A bioshelter structure uses glazing to contain and protect the living biology inside, control air exchange and absorb energy. The building exchanges nutrients, gases and energy with the surrounding environment, produces crops, and recycles waste organic material into the soil. Solar energy is stored as heat energy in thermal mass such as water, stone, masonry, soil and plant biomass. The second is the biology inside the bioshelter. Earle Barnhart of the New Alchemy Institute has compared a bioshelter to a contained ecosystem.Barnhart, E. 1978. Biotechnic Strategies in Bioshelters, The Journal of the New Alchemists No. 5, New Alchemy Institute, Falmouth MA Solar heat is absorbed and stored in thermal mass to moderate air temperatures and provide heat for later use. Water moves from rainfall to fishponds to soil to plants and finally to water vapor. Year- round habitat is provided for beneficial insects . Ecological relationships between pests and their predators reduce the number of pests. Gases are exchanged among the animals, insects, micro-organisms, soil and plants. Nutrient cycles are developed between fish, plant & soil. Within the bioshelter are a variety of microclimates. The south areas receive the most direct sunlight. The east and west areas can be shaded for a portion of the day. Higher levels in a growing space will be warmer. A well-designed bioshelter, managed by human intelligence, can shelter a community of people, food crops, edible fish, and a diverse ecosystem of plants, animals and soil life. ==References== ==External links== * New Alchemy Institute Category:Greenhouses Category:Artificial ecosystems ","title":"Bioshelter"},{"id":"3229543","text":"Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork are a common food taboo, particularly in the Middle East among Jews and Muslims. Swine were prohibited in ancient SyriaLucian of Samosata notes that they do indeed eat pork for followers of the Dea Syria (Atargatis, the 'Syrian goddess') in De dea Syria, noted in Jan N. Bremmer, \\"Attis: A Greek God in Anatolian Pessinous and Catullan Rome\\", Mnemosyne, Fourth Series, 57.5, (2004:534–573) p. 538. and Phoenicia,As the pagan Porphyry of Tyre noted in De abstinentia ab esu animalium, late third century CE. and the pig and its flesh represented a taboo observed, Strabo noted, at Comana in Pontus.Strabo, xii.8.9. A lost poem of Hermesianax, reported centuries later by the traveller Pausanias, reported an etiological myth of Attis destroyed by a supernatural boar to account for the fact that \\"in consequence of these events the Galatians who inhabit Pessinous do not touch pork\\".Noted in Bremmer 2004:538 and notes. Bremmer notes that the taboo regarding pork for followers of Attis is reported in Julian, Orationes v.17. Concerning Abrahamic religions, clear restrictions exist in Jewish dietary laws (Kashrut) and in Islamic dietary laws (Halal). Although Christianity is also an Abrahamic religion, most of its adherents do not follow these aspects of Mosaic law and are permitted to consume pork. However, Seventh-day Adventists consider pork taboo, along with other foods forbidden by Jewish law. The Eritrean Orthodox Church and the Ethiopian Orthodox ChurchCharles Kong Soo Ethiopian Holy Week clashes with Christians' 21 April 2011 Trinidad and Tobago Guardian Retrieved 11 March 2012 do not permit pork consumption. Many Yazidis in Kurdistan regard pork as forbidden.Halil Savucu: Yeziden in Deutschland: Eine Religionsgemeinschaft zwischen Tradition, Integration und Assimilation Tectum Wissenschaftsverlag, Marburg 2016, , Section 16 (German) ==Prohibitions in the Judaism law== The Torah (Pentateuch) contains passages in Leviticus that lists the animals people are permitted to eat. It first notes what qualifies an animal that is absolutely permitted: Animals that have cloven hooves and chew their cud are ruminants such as cows, sheep, and deer. This text does not specify every possible animal by name, only their behaviors. The text goes on to describe specific animals that are known and meet one, but not both, of those qualifications, thereby prohibiting their consumption. It does not elaborate on the exact reason for prohibition other than physical characteristics. Pigs are described in this section as prohibited because they have a cloven hoof but don't chew their cud. Deuteronomy expands on the list of permitted animals. Deuteronomy reiterates what Leviticus states on pigs. ==Prohibitions in Islamic law== One example of verses from the Quran on pig consumption: The prohibition of certain food is also linked to Islamic Cosmology. Accordingly good and evil qualities are transferred by eating an object carrying a certain quality, that also affects the soul of human, the pig rendered with evil qualities.Seyyed Hossein Nasr Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines, An SUNY Press 1993 p. 70 ==Other== According to Herodotus, The Scythians had a taboo against the pig, which was never offered in sacrifice, and apparently the Scythians were loath to so much as keep swine within their lands.Macaulay (1904:315). Scottish pork taboo was Donald Alexander Mackenzie's phrase for discussing an aversion to pork among Scots, particularly Highlanders, which he believed stemmed from an ancient taboo. Several writers who confirm that there was a prejudice against pork, or a superstitious attitude toward pigs, do not see it in terms of a taboo related to an ancient cult. Any prejudice is generally agreed to have disappeared by 1800. ==Interpretations of restrictions== The cultural materialistic anthropologist Marvin Harris thinks that the main reason for prohibiting consumption of pork was ecological- economical. Pigs require water and shady woods with seeds, but those conditions are scarce in the Middle East. Unlike many other forms of livestock, pigs are omnivorous scavengers, eating virtually anything they come across, including carrion and refuse, which was deemed unclean. Furthermore, a Middle Eastern society keeping large stocks of pigs could destroy their ecosystem. It is speculated that chickens supplanted pigs as a more portable and efficient source of meat, and these practical concerns led to the religious restrictions. Maimonides, the Jewish philosopher, legal codifier, and court physician to the Muslim sultan Saladin in the 12th century, understood the dietary laws chiefly as a means of keeping the body healthy. He argued that the meat of the forbidden animals, birds, and fish is unwholesome and indigestible. According to Maimonides, at first glance, this does not apply to pork, which does not appear to be harmful. Yet, Maimonides observes, the pig is a filthy animal, and if swine were used for food, marketplaces and even houses would be dirtier than latrines.Maimonides, A Guide for the Perplexed III:48 Rashi (the primary Jewish commentator on the Bible and Talmud) lists the prohibition of pig as a law whose reason is not known, and may therefore be derided by others as making no sense.Rashi on Leviticus 18:4 The Chinuch Sefer HaChinuchSefer HaChinuch Mitzvah 73 (an early work of Halachah) gives a general overview of the Jewish dietary laws. He writes \\"And if there are any reasons for the dietary laws which are unknown to us or those knowledgeable in the health field, do not wonder about them, for the true Healer that warns us against them is smarter than us, and smarter than the doctors.\\" ==See also== * Islamic dietary laws * Jewish dietary laws * Kosher * Kosher foods * Pigbel * Pig toilet * Trichinosis * Unclean animal ==References== ==External links== * Verse 174 of Chapter 2 (Al-Baqarah) in the Quran prohibiting \\"the blood and flesh of swine\\" ' * Laws of Judaism and Islam concerning food * Pork ","title":"Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork"},{"id":"3229577","text":"is a tactical role-playing game developed by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive in 1991.

It is the second collaboration between Van Damme and Hong Kong film director Ringo Lam, and the third time that Van Damme has starred in a dual role. The film had a limited theatrical release in many European countries, and was released on direct-to- DVD in the United States on September 18, 2001. ==Plot== Edward \\"the Torch\\" Garrotte (Jean-Claude van Damme) is a serial killer who has a penchant for killing women and setting them on fire. All of his victims are also mothers. Detective Jake Riley (Michael Rooker) is a Seattle police detective who has spent three years chasing Garrotte. Just days before Jake's retirement Garrotte strikes again, but Jake is off the case. During his retirement party, Jake receives a call from Garrotte, who threatens to go after his friends and family. Realizing Garrotte needs to be stopped no matter what, Riley sets out to stop him. A secret government agency hires Jake as a consultant on a special project. They have cloned Garrotte from DNA evidence found at a crime scene. They need Jake's help to train this Replicant, who has genetic memories from Garrotte and a telepathic link to him. The Replicant has the body of a 40-year-old but the mind of a child. Jake's job is to help the Replicant track Garrotte down by using the memories stored in Garrotte's DNA. The Replicant and Jake begin to hunt Garrotte. Jake believes the Replicant could turn on him at any time, as Garrotte's killer instinct may take over. The Replicant tries to understand the world, and his connection with Garrotte. The Replicant does not understand why Jake treats him so roughly, since he views Jake as family. Though Jake is abusive, the Replicant looks to him for protection and guidance as they close in on Garrotte. Garrotte and the Replicant confront each other in a bar after Garrotte fails to kill Jake with a bomb. Garrotte kills a bartender, but lets the Replicant live. An origin story shows that Garrotte was abused by his mother, who then killed her unfaithful husband, and tried to burn their house down, which reveals why Garrotte hates women. They confront each other later in a parking garage. Garrotte tries to convince his \\"brother\\" that Jake cannot be trusted. Frustrated that Garrotte got away, Jake asks why the Replicant let him go. The Replicant replies, \\"We are the same.\\" Jake tries to tell the Replicant that Garrotte is a sociopath, but he refuses to listen. They find out Garrotte's real name, Luc Savard, and go to the hospital to talk with Savard's mother (Margaret Ryan), but she had already died of a heart attack. Garrotte arrives and beats Jake and also wants his \\"brother\\" to join him by killing Jake, but he refuses, forcing Garrotte to try and execute both of them. Jake and the killer fight, leading to an ambulance chase in the parking garage. The van crashes into a toll booth, but the killer escapes. He hits Jake with a shovel and plans to burn him alive. The Replicant and killer fight again in the hospital's furnace room. The Replicant wants to kill Garrotte, but realizes that he is not a killer like him. Garrotte hits the Replicant with a shovel, which causes Jake to shoot him. The Replicant suddenly understands that Jake is his real family. An air conditioner, damaged in the fight, explodes, supposedly killing the Replicant after he gets Jake to safety. Upset by the death of his new \\"partner\\", Jake decides to retire from his new job as a consultant. Weeks later, Jake is with his wife Anne (Catherine Dent) and stepson Danny (Brandon James Olson).

Ike originated from an area of disturbed weather southeast of Guam on August 21, 1984, and five days later, developed into a tropical depression. Following an increase in organization, the depression attained tropical storm intensity on August 27\\\\. Initially tracking west-southwest, the storm gradually gained strength as wind shear resulted relaxed and Ike became a typhoon on August 30\\\\. Continuing to rapidly intensity, Ike turned west and attained peak intensity on September 1, with the Japan Meteorological Agency estimating winds of . At around 14:00 UTC that day, Ike made landfall on the northeastern tip of Mindanao. The cyclone emerged into the South China Sea on September 3 as a tropical storm before re- intensifying into a typhoon and moving onshore Hainan. Ike then struck the Chinese mainland as a tropical storm in the Guangxi province and dissipated on September 6\\\\. During its formative stages, Ike brushed Guam, although its compact size reduced the extent of damage. Typhoon Ike also struck the Philippines a mere four days after Tropical Storm June inundated the northern portion of the Philippines and also was suffering from the nation's worst economic crisis since independence in 1946. It also left a path of destruction in the Philippines that at the time was unparalleled in its modern history. Most of the deaths were in the province of Surigao del Norte, where around 1,000 died, 330 others were wounded, and 80% of structures along with 27 towns were flattened. Typhoon Ike was considered the worst typhoon to affect the province in 20 years. Roughly 90% of homes in Surigao City were leveled, leaving 90,000 individuals homeless. Throughout Negros Island, over 4,000 dwellings were destroyed, resulting in nearly 75,000 people homeless after a river burst its banks. In the province of Bohol, Ike was the deadliest natural disaster in the province's history, with 198 fatalities in addition to 89,000 homes damaged or destroyed. Overall, 1,426 people were killed as a result of the typhoon in the archipelago. At the time, Ike was the deadliest typhoon to hit the country during the 20th century, surpassing the previous record of Typhoon Amy in 1951. A total of 1,856 people were injured. Furthermore, 142,653 homes were damaged and 108,219 others were destroyed. Nationwide, damage was estimated at $230 million, including $76.5 million from crop damage and $111 million from property damage. Following the storm, Philippines authorities initially distributed $4 million in aid but refused international aid. However, authorities reversed its decision on September 8 due to lack of local resources and started accepting foreign aid. In all, over $7.5 million was donated to the country to provide relief. Ike was the worst tropical cyclone to strike the Guangxi province in China since 1954, where 14 people were killed. Across the country, around 13,000 structures were damaged or destroyed. Nationwide, 46 people were killed and 12,000 ha (29,651 acres) of sugar cane were destroyed. About 1,315,420 kg (2,900,000 lb) of vegetables were lost. Elsewhere, two people were killed and seven were listed missing in Thailand due to flash flooding. == Meteorological history == The origins of Typhoon Ike can be traced back to an area of disturbed weather first identified as part of the region's monsoon trough southeast of Guam on August 21\\\\. Over the next few days, the disturbance failed to develop as a result of inhibiting wind shear which remained over the area. However, the shear quickly abated on August 25, allowing for convection to build and persist over the system's center of circulation; this prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to classify the system at 06:00 UTC on August 26 as a tropical depression. Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system, following a rapid increase in the system's organization. Tracking generally northward, it continued to improve in organization and became more compact, allowing both the JMA and the JTWC to upgrade the system to Tropical Storm Ike on August 27. Ike's track northward brought it southwest of Guam before the tropical storm stalled and turned towards the west-southwest on August 28 as a result of a subtropical ridge to its north. Initially, persistent wind shear limited intensification, but data from the JTWC suggested that Ike briefly attained typhoon status on August 29. By August 30, an upper-level anticyclone became established over the system, resulting in favorable conditions aloft, and Ike entered a second intensification phase. At midday, both the JTWC and JMA estimated that Ike attained typhoon status. On August 31, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Nitang. Now assuming a more westerly bearing, Ike continued to rapidly strengthen; at 12:00 UTC on September 1, the typhoon reached its peak intensity with winds of and a barometric pressure of 950 mbar (hPa; 28.05 inHg) as analyzed by the JMA. Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated maximum intensity of . With maximum intensity, Ike made landfall on the northeastern tip of Mindanao at around 14:00 UTC on September 1, taking 30 hours to track across the southern extent of the Philippines. The cyclone emerged into the South China Sea on September 3, but due to land interaction, both the JTWC and JMA reported that Ike had weakened to a tropical storm upon its emergence. The storm tracked northwestward across the South China Sea over the next few days. Ike regained its former typhoon classification on September 3, according to the JTWC, and on September 4, according to the JMA. Several hours later, data from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicated that Ike had developed a wide eye. The JMA estimated that it reached a secondary peak intensity on September 4 with winds of and a pressure of 955 mbar (hPa; 28.20 inHg), only slightly weaker than its peak strength while the JTWC estimated a secondary peak of . The combination of increased wind shear induced by a trough passing to the storm's north and the typhoon's proximity to land caused Ike to weaken. The storm made a September 5 landfall on Hainan as a minimal typhoon. The storm continued to weaken after crossing Hainan, with both the JTWC and JMA estimating that it moved into the Chinese mainland as a tropical storm while it was located southeast of Nanning. Thereafter, Ike quickly weakened inland and dissipated on September 6. == Preparations == Prior to the typhoon's first landfall, a typhoon warning was issued by the Manila Weather Bureau for the Philippine provinces of Surigao del Norte, Agusan, Leyte, Samar, Camiguin, Bohol, Cebu, Misamis Oriental, and Negros. Local authorities warned at risk residents via radio to flee to higher ground due to the threat of destructive storm surge. Although no mandatory evacuation was in effect, local radio stations broadcast appeals for evacuation every 30 minutes under the direction of the Manila Weather Bureau. When Ike began to turn towards the northwest on September 3, typhoon warnings were issued for coastal areas between Hong Kong and Beihai. Hundreds of cargo ships left port to escape the typhoon. In Zhanjiang, sandbagging operations took place in an effort to construct a barrier against Ike's storm surge. Hundreds of thousands of residents evacuated from coastal areas.Longshore, p. 185. Offshore, four foreign oil companies evacuated workers off of drilling rigs in the South China Sea. Further north, in Hong Kong, a No 1. hurricane signal was issued on September 4 and later that day was upped to a No 3. hurricane signal, but this signal was dropped once the storm dissipated inland. == Impact == === Philippines === Upon making landfall on northeastern Mindanao on September 1, Ike became the strongest tropical cyclone to strike the Philippines since Typhoon Joan of the 1970 Pacific typhoon season. Typhoon Ike also struck the country a mere four days after Tropical Storm June inundated the northern portion of the country, which claimed 53 lives. The islands were also suffering from the worst economic crisis since independence in 1946. Power was knocked out to much of the country for four days. The typhoon left a path of destruction in the Philippines that was at its time unparalleled in modern Philippine history. Most of the fatalities were in the province of Surigao del Norte, where around 1,000 died and 27 towns were flattened. More than half of Surigao del Norte's cattle, goat, and pig population were killed. Waves slammed into the provincial capital of Surigao City, which resulted in 85 casualties. Around 90% of homes in the city were leveled, leaving 90,000 out the town's 135,000 citizens homeless. Fresh water shortages occurred after power was lost in Surigao City. To the southwest in Mainit, numerous homes were swept away after Lake Mainit overflowed its banks, leading to the deaths of over 200 people. On nearby Nonoc Island, 101 were killed, primarily due to drownings, and all but 20 houses of the 2,000 on the island were demolished. Provincewide, 330 people were wounded and 70% of homes, mostly made of wood, and 80% of buildings were destroyed, which resulted in 480,000 homeless. Typhoon Ike was considered the worst typhoon to affect the province in 20 years. Further south, in the province of Surigao del Sur, 16 people perished. Ten boats sunk offshore the capital city of Manila, where more than 6,000 residences were destroyed. However, the capital was spared the inner core of the typhoon. Elsewhere, in Cebu, thousands of refugees stayed in town halls and churches during the storm; 10 people were injured by flying debris and another 12 went missing on the island. Strong winds snapped power lines in Cebu, resulting in a power outage that impacted the entire province and halted all radio broadcasts in the prefecture. Off of Cebu City, 10 ferries sunk due to the strong waves generated by Ike. Roads connecting Cebu City to 44 peripheral towns were blocked by fallen trees and severe flooding. Throughout the province, 90,000 people were left homeless and damage totaled at least $6.8 million. Throughout Negros Island, over 4,000 dwellings were destroyed, displacing nearly 75,000 people.

Nationwide, 1,426 people were killed as a result of the typhoon, making Ike the deadliest typhoon to hit the country in the 20th century at the time, surpassing the previous record of Typhoon Amy in 1951.

At the time of its second landfall, Ike was a large but weakening tropical system, with gale-force winds extending out from the center. The storm brought of rain to most of the affected areas, with locally higher amounts. Thirteen fishermen were overcome by the swells off the coast of Weizhou Island. Across the Guangdong province, 2,000 houses were destroyed. In the Guangxi province near the storm made landfall, the storm destroyed zones of homes, factories, and boats, especially in the coastal towns of Beihai, Qinzhou, and Fancheng.

Nearby, a scaffolding and hoardings were blown down at a construction site. Otherwise, no damage was reported in Hong Kong. === Elsewhere === Due to the proximity of Ike to Guam upon its formation, the island was placed under the \\"Condition of Readiness\\" level; this was the first time that such a high readiness level was issued since Typhoon Pamela in 1982. Although Ike passed somewhat near the island, the storm's compact size during its formative stages mitigated any damage. Despite being near typhoon intensity at the time, a station on Nimitz Hill only documented winds of , with higher gusts. The outer rainbands of the typhoon brought unseasonably heavy rains to Thailand. There, four people were reported missing and ten were injured after water from an overflowing dam tipped over a bus. Two people were killed and three were rendered missing due to flash flooding in Bangkok. Elsewhere, the outer extremities of Ike produced light rainfall and light breezes on Okinawa, peaking at in Ibaruma, most of which fell in an hour. == Aftermath == Immediately following Ike, the Government of the Philippines dispatched a C-130 aircraft carrying relief supplies to the affected areas, including 32,000 tonnes (35,000 tons) to Suriago City. The large loss of life resulted in morgues running out of coffins, leading to bodies being immediately buried to prevent the spread of disease. Imelda Marcos, the wife of president Ferdinand Marcos, flew to Surigao City to personally hand out relief supplies. Ferdinand Marcos warned on television for profiteers and looters to not \\"take advantage of the situation\\". Nevertheless, the typhoon set the stage for protests against Marcos and his handling of the storm throughout the country for the rest of the month. The president set aside $4 million for relief work but initially refused any international aid. Despite this, the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies appealed in Switzerland for $800,000 in emergency aid for victims of the typhoon. The Philippines Air Force delivered of food, medicine, and clothes. According to officials, 92 health teams backed by 17 army medical units were fielded; these teams distributed $1.66 million worth of medicine. The Philippine Red Cross disturbed food to 239,331 people, or 44,247 families. The mayor of Suriago City applied for national aid since the city's residents faced starvation. On September 9, President Marcos ordered $100,000 worth of cash to seven province governors, and released $555,000 with the intent of rebuilding Suriago City. A task force was also sent up by him in order to speed up the recovery process. On September 8, the nation abandoned its policy of refusing foreign aid, citing a lack of resources due to the country's poor economy. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs gave an emergency grant of $50,000. UNICEF provided $116,000 worth of vitamins and medicine and an additional $116,950 in cash, as well as of milk powder. They later provided vegetable seeds, dried fish, and garden fertilizer. The World Health Organization provided $7,000 worth of aid. Furthermore, the United Nations Development Programme awarded the country $30,000 in cash. The European Economic Community provided of milk and $367,650 worth of cash. In the middle of September, the United States approved $1 million in aid to the archipelago. Japan also sent a $500,000 check. Australia awarded almost $500,000 worth of cash and food. New Zealand donated of skimmed milk. The Norwegian Red Cross provided $58,500 in aid while the European Economic Community awarded just over $7,000 in cash. Belgium also provided three medical kits. The Swiss Red Cross awarded a little under $21,000 in cash. Germany provided slightly more than $50,000 in cash. France provided roughly $11,000 in donations to the nation's red cross. The Red Cross Society of China donated $20,000 in cash. Indonesia provided $25,000 worth of medicine. The United Kingdom granted $74,441 in aid. Overall, Relief Web reported that over $7.5 million was donated to the Philippines due to the storm. Starting on September 11, a massive relief item airlift was planned to assist the region. Due to Tropical Storm June, 19 provinces had already been placed under a state of emergency. Following Ike, three other provinces were placed under a state of emergency. Due to both Ike and June, 25 of the nation's 73 provinces were declared a disaster area. Because of the destruction in the Philippines, the name Ike was retired and was replaced by Ian. The name Nitang, was also retired, and was replaced by Ningning. == See also == * Typhoon Mike – passed north of Mindanao and impacted the central Philippines, resulting in catastrophic damage * Typhoon Nelson (1982) – resulted in significant flooding across the Philippines after slowly traversing the archipelago * Typhoon Haiyan * Typhoon Agnes (1984) – caused extensive damage and fatalities in the central Philippines before striking Vietnam * Typhoon Rammasun == Notes == == References == == Further reading == * == External links == * JTWC Ike Report * Deadly Philippine History Category:Retired Pacific typhoons Category:1984 Pacific typhoon season Category:Typhoons in the Philippines Category:Retired Philippine typhoon names Category:Typhoons Category:Typhoons in Guam Ike ","title":"Typhoon Ike"},{"id":"3229603","text":"Lucy Hay, Countess of Carlisle, Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Henrietta Maria. The Lady of the Bedchamber is the title of a lady-in-waiting holding the official position of personal attendant on a British queen or princess. The position is traditionally held by a female member of a noble family. They are ranked between the First Lady of the Bedchamber and the Women of the Bedchamber. They are also styled Gentlewoman of Her Majesty's Bedchamber. The equivalent title and office has historically been used in most European royal courts (Dutch: Dames du Palais; French: Dames or Dame de Palais; German: Hofstaatsdame or Palastdame; Italian: Dame di Corte; Russian: Hofdame or Statsdame; Spanish: Dueña de honor; Swedish: Statsfru). ==History== In the Middle Ages, Margaret of France, the wife of King Edward I of England, is noted to have had seven ladies of the bedchamber: the three married ones were called Dominæ and the four unmarried ones were known as maids of honour. Their task was simply to act as the companions (see lady's companion) and personal attendants to the royal woman. In a description from 1728, the task of the Ladies of the Bedchamber was to act as the go-between for the queen and the Women of the Bedchamber, who had the task to wait upon the queen by helping her wash, dress and undress, and so forth. A Woman of the Bedchamber worked independently from a Lady of the Bedchamber and did not take orders from her. However, if a Lady of the Bedchamber was present, a Woman of the Bedchamber would always defer to her. If a Lady of the Bedchamber was present when a Woman of the Bedchamber arrived to dress the queen, for example, she would not dress the queen herself, but instead give the garments to the Lady of the Bedchamber, who in turn helped the queen put it on. The procedure was the same in other issues. The post of a Lady of the Bedchamber was considered prestigious, and the appointments have therefore been subjected to controversies. Queen Anne appointed Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, to this position; the Duchess was widely considered an influential royal favourite. In 1839, concerns that Queen Victoria was determined to surround herself with wives of Whig politicians led to the Bedchamber crisis, preventing the installation of a Tory government under Robert Peel. ==List of Ladies of the Bedchamber to the Queens of England== This is an incomplete list of those who have served as Lady of the Bedchamber in the British Royal Household. ===Catherine of Aragon, 1509–1536=== * Anne Bourchier, Lady Dacre of the South * Margaret Brent (?), Lady Bergavenny * Mabel Dacre, Lady Scrope * Mary Grey, Lady Ferrers of Chartley * Lady Anne Percy, Lady Maltravers, Countess of Arundel * Inez de Venegas, Lady Mountjoy ( Lord Mountjoy’s 2nd wife) * Elizabeth Willoughby, Lady Maltravers ===Elizabeth I, 1558–1603=== *1558–1565: Katherine Ashley (née Champernowne), Lady Ashley *1559–1569: Catherine Carey, Lady Knollys, also 1st Cousin or half-Sister to Elizabeth I *1568–1599: Elizabeth Stafford *1587 Frances Newton, Baroness Cobham ===Anne of Denmark, 1603–1619=== Anne of Denmark was Queen Consort to James I of England. * Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford * Penelope Blount, Countess of Devonshire * Anne Livingstone, Countess of Eglinton. * Elizabeth Schaw.

The angling was officially banned in this Tiger reserve from 2011. Ibisbill in Nameri National Park ==Flora== The vegetation type of nameri is of semi-evergreen, moist deciduous forests with cane and bamboo brakes and narrow strips of open grassland along rivers are also found here. The forests are rich in epiphytes, lianas, and creepers and clump-forming bamboo. This forest has over 600 species. Some notable species are Gmelina arborea, Michelia champaca, Amoora wallichi, Chukrasia tabularis, Ajar, Urium poma, Bhelu, Agaru, Rudraksha, Bonjolokia, Hatipolia akhakan, hollock, Nahor. It is home for orchids like Dendrobium, Cymbidium and Cypripedioideae. Nameri National Park-Kangkan Hazarika ==Fauna== This is excellent elephant country and was considered to be an elephant reserve. It is an ideal habitat for a host of other animals including the tiger, leopard, Hog Deer, sambar, dhole (the Asiatic wild dog), Gaur, clouded leopard, leopard cat, Barking Deer ,wild boar, sloth bear, Marbled Cat, Himalayan black bear, capped langur and Indian giant squirrel. Wild Elephant at nameri National Park A pair of White- Dragontail butterfly in Nameri Nameri is a birdwatcher's paradise with over 300 species. The white winged wood duck, great pied hornbill, wreathed hornbill, rufous necked hornbill, black stork, ibisbill, blue-bearded bee- eaters, babblers, plovers and many other birds make Nameri their home. == Birding in Nameri == A pair of Asian fairy Bluebird in Nameri White winged duck or White winged wood duck (Asarcornis scutulata) clicked by Pallav Pranjal Nameri is the best sighting spot of the endangered bird White- winged Duck (Asarcornis scutulata), which is also the state bird of Assam. Ibisbill and Merganser are the two species of migratory birds visit the park every winter. There are 374 (Three hundred seventy four) species of bird recorded from this park in 2005 by Mr. Maan Barua and Mr. Pankaj Sharma. ==Conflicts and threats== Nameri faces two threats: One is due to continued official logging in the area of Sonitpur. The major threat for Nameri is human/animal conflict due to around 3000 cattle grazing the forest. The other human/animal conflict is due to the vast group of elephants in Nameri. There were several cases of elephant deaths. In 2001 there were 18 elephant deaths. A great threat is possessed on this protected area because of poachers who hunt the valuable birds for their wings. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests Category:Tiger reserves of India Category:National parks in Assam Category:Tourism in North East India Category:Tourism in Assam ","title":"Nameri National Park"},{"id":"3229641","text":"The great Indian bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps) or Indian bustard is a bustard found on the Indian subcontinent. A large bird with a horizontal body and long bare legs, giving it an ostrich like appearance, this bird is among the heaviest of the flying birds. Once common on the dry plains of the Indian subcontinent, as few as 150 individuals were estimated to survive in 2018 (reduced from an estimated 250 individuals in 2011) and the species is critically endangered by hunting and loss of its habitat, which consists of large expanses of dry grassland and scrub. These birds are often found associated in the same habitat as blackbuck. It is protected under Wildlife Protection Act 1972 of India. ==Description== The great Indian bustard is a large ground bird with a height of about one metre. It is unmistakable with its black cap contrasting with the pale head and neck. The body is brownish with a black patch spotted in white. The male is deep sandy buff coloured and during the breeding season has a black breast band. The crown of the head is black and crested and is puffed up by displaying males. In the female which is smaller than the male, the head and neck are not pure white and the breast band is either rudimentary, broken or absent. Among bustards, this species is smaller only than the Kori bustard and the great bustard in size. It is also the largest land bird in its native range. The great Indian bustard stands at about tall, having a somewhat long neck and quite long legs. The female as in most members of the bustard family are typically considerably smaller. Males have a well-developed gular pouch which is inflated when calling during display and helps produce the deep resonant calls. Abnormally leucistic or near albino birds have been reported. ==Distribution and habitat== Illustration by Henrik Grönvold from E. C. Stuart Baker's Game-birds of India, Burma and Ceylon This species was formerly widespread in India and Pakistan. The bustard is critically endangered in Pakistan primarily due to lack of protection and rampant hunting. A few birds were detected in a September 2013 survey of the Cholistan Desert in Pakistan. In India, the bird was historically found in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Today the bustard is restricted to isolated pockets in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan (shared with Pakistan). Great Indian bustards make local movements but these are not well understood although it is known that populations disperse after the monsoons. Males are said to be solitary during the breeding season but form small flocks in winter. Males may however distribute themselves close together and like other bustards they are believed to use a mating system that has been termed as an \\"exploded or dispersed lek\\". The male is polygamous. The habitat where it is most often found is arid and semi-arid grasslands, open country with thorn scrub, tall grass interspersed with cultivation. It avoids irrigated areas. The major areas where they are known to breed are in central and western India and eastern Pakistan. The dry semi- desert regions where it was found in parts of Rajasthan has been altered by irrigation canals that have transformed the region into an intensively farmed area. ==Behaviour and ecology== The great Indian bustard is omnivorous. Apparently, insects, consisting mainly of Orthoptera, but also beetles,( particularly Mylabris sp.) are preferred in the diet. Alternatively, they will take grass seeds, berries (largely of the genera Ziziphus and Eruca), rodents and reptiles (in Rajasthan they are known to take Indian spiny-tailed lizards Uromastyx hardwickii). In cultivated areas, they feed on crops such as exposed groundnut, millets and pods of legumes. They drink water if it is available and will sometimes sit down to drink or suck water followed by raising up their heads at an angle. When threatened, hens are said to carry young chicks under the wing. Male (left) and female in display, Rajasthan Breeding occurs between March and September, when the inflated fluffy white feathers of the male are inflated and displayed. Territorial fights between males may involve strutting next to each other, leaping against each other with legs against each other and landing down to lock the opponent's head under their neck. During courtship display, the male inflates the gular sac which opens under the tongue, inflating it so that a large wobbly bag appears to hang down from the neck. The tail is held cocked up over the body. The male also raises the tail and folds it on its back. The male periodically produces a resonant deep, booming call that may be heard for nearly 500m. The female lays a single egg in an unlined scrape on the ground. Only the females are involved in incubation and care of the young. The eggs are at risk of destruction from other animals particularly ungulates and crows. Females may use a distraction display that involves flying zigzag with dangling legs. ==Status== From Thomas Hardwicke's Illustrations of Indian Zoology (1830–1835) In 2011 Birdlife International uplisted this species from Endangered to Critically Endangered, mainly because it has been exirpated from 90% of its former range and the population was estimated at perhaps fewer than 250 individuals in 2008. The main threats are hunting and habitat loss. In the past they were heavily hunted for their meat and for sport and, today, poaching of the species may continue. In some places, such as Rajasthan, increased irrigation by the Indira Gandhi canal has led to increased agriculture and the altered habitat has led to the disappearance of the species from these regions. Some populations migrate into Pakistan where hunting pressure is high. The bird is found in Rajasthan, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat states of India. Desert National Park, near Jaisalmer and coastal grasslands of the Abdasa and Mandvi talukas of Kutch District of Gujarat support some populations. Ghatigaon and Karera sanctuaries in Madhya Pradesh once held sizeable populations. Other sanctuaries with the species include Kutch Bustard Sanctuary of Naliya in Kutch, Karera Wildlife Sanctuary in Shivpuri district;Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary near Nannaj, 18 km from Solapur in Maharashtra, Shrigonda taluka in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra, near Nagpur and near Warora in Chandrapur district in Maharashtra and Rollapadu Wildlife Sanctuary, 45 km from Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh. At Ranibennur Blackbuck Sanctuary, habitat changes have affected the populations of blackbuck and bustards. In the 1950s the scrub forest was replaced with Eucalyptus plantations. These helped wildlife when the trees were short but after their extensive growth they made the adjoining grassland less favourable for bustards. A 2011 study of the variability in mitochondrial DNA (hypervariable control region II and cytochrome b) in 63 samples from 5 Indian states found very low genetic diversity suggesting a historical population reduction. The study suggested a population reduction or near extinction estimated about 20–40,000 years ago. Attempts to breed them in captivity in the 1970s failed. The species is considered as \\"critically endangered\\" by the IUCN Red data list. ==Conservation== The rapid reduction of the population of India's bustards, their endangered status and the decline of grasslands led the Ministry of Environment and Forests to prepare species recovery programs in 2012 for three species of bustard; the great Indian bustard, the Bengal florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis) and the lesser florican (Sypheotides indicus). These programs remain to be finalised and executed by the state wildlife departments. The state of Rajasthan initiated \\"Project Great Indian Bustard\\", on World Environment Day 2013, identifying and fencing off bustard breeding grounds in existing protected areas as well as provide secure breeding enclosures in areas outside protected areas. Current threats to the species include the development of linear infrastructure intrusions such as roads and electric power lines in the desert that lead to collision-related mortality. Proposed expansion of renewable energy infrastructure, which may involve deploying solar panels over large areas of desert and grasslands is another threat to the bird's habitat. In 2020, nine chicks were incubated successfully creating a world record. ==In culture== Eggs of the species in comparison to the smaller ones of the lesser florican The Mughal emperor Babur noted that \\"[while] the flesh of the leg of some fowls, and of the breast of others is excellent; the flesh of every part of the Kharchal is delicious\\". The great Indian bustard was however a cryptic and wary bird making it a challenge for sportsmen, who had to stalk carefully (sometimes using covered bullock carts) to get within range. British soldiers in India considered it a delicacy and the species was among the top game-birds. William Henry Sykes notes that they were common in the Deccan region where a \\"gentleman\\" had shot a thousand birds. (E C Stuart Baker however notes that this may have been an exaggeration- ...we must remember that those were the days when tigers averaged twelve feet...) Jerdon noted that subadults and females had tastier flesh than males while Salim Ali notes that feeding on Mylabris (now Hycleus) tainted their flesh. Tribal Bhils are claimed to have used a technique for trapping females that involves setting twigs on fire around the nest containing an egg or chick. The female was then said to run to the nest and singe its wings upon which the tribals captured it. Other trapping methods involving the use of nooses are described by Hume in his \\"Game Birds of India\\". The invention of the Jeep changed the method of hunting and it became extremely easy for hunters to chase bustards down in their open semi-desert habitats. The name hoom is used in parts of Maharashtra and is derived from the low booming call. The sharp barking alarm call leads to its name of hookna in some parts of northern India. It is known in some other parts as Gaganbher or Gurayin for the resemblance of other calls to thunder or the roar of a tiger. When the \\"national bird\\" of India was under consideration, the great Indian bustard was a proposed candidate (strongly supported by the Indian ornithologist Salim Ali), but dropped in favour of the Indian peafowl with at least one reason being the potential for being misspelt. ==References== ==Other sources== * Bhushan, B.

The Bayerischer Platz station was built in 1909/10 to the design of Johannes Kraaz. However, the platform areas of each station on the line were built to a standardised design, presumed to be by Friedrich Gerlach, the Prussian official who was involved in every facet of the development of Schöneberg.Peter Güttler, Institut für Städtebau und Architektur der Berliner Bauakademie, Architekten- und Ingenieur-Verein zu Berlin, Berlin: Ernst, 1990, , Berlin-Brandenburg: ein Architekturführer, p. 128 The stations resemble those of Alfred Grenander and emulate his use of a distinguishing colour for each station. Kraaz conceived of the south entrance to the station as a pergola integrated into Fritz Encke's architecture in the square. Since it was the only station on the line to have a 90 m long platform from the start, it was given another entrance at the north end, also in pergola style.U4 Bayerischer Platz , Berliner-Untergrundbahn.de This entrance survives largely unchanged today. However, the south entrance, which had been rebuilt after being destroyed in World War II, had to be removed in 1956/57 when Grunewaldstraße was straightened to run through the square.Die Bahnhöfe der U4: Bayerischer Platz , Untergrundbahn.de Already at the time of the station's construction, there were plans to have a line to Neukölln cross at this point. The station was intended to bridge such a future line, which would eventually be built 60 years later. On 3 February 1945, during World War II, several Allied bombs scored direct hits on the station while 2 trains were halted there, killing 63 people.Die U-Bahn im 2. Weltkrieg , Berliner- Untergrundbahn.de Possibly more than 100: Ruth Andreas-Friedrich, Schauplatz Berlin: ein deutsches Tagebuch, Munich: Lentz, 1962, , p. 127: \\"Mehr als hundert Tote\\". ===North entrance and U4 platform=== The north entrance and lobby with their wrought iron railings and pilasters are largely unchanged, the only station entrance on the line to be preserved. The walls are tiled in blue and the stairwells faced with fossil-bearing rock. In the platform area, the original white and blue wall tiles (the heraldic colours of Bavaria) were replaced with slightly brighter colours during reconstruction after the war, but the platform appears almost as it did, and two original kiosks, one with the original tiling, also remain. The next station is Viktoria-Luise-Platz or Rathaus Schoneberg. ===U7 station and new south entrance=== U7 platform Artwork inside south entrance The lower-level U7 portion of the station, built to Rainer G. Rümmler's design in 1968-70 and opened in 1971, also makes use of the Bavarian colours: the walls are clad in blue fibre cement panels with the station name on a white horizontal stripe, and the support columns are white.Die Bahnhöfe der U7: Bayerischer Platz , Untergrundbahn.de The ceiling, resembling skylights in industrial buildings, was designed to avoid dazzling train operators; the fluorescent lights are inset in red piping.

He lived in the wilderness of Judea between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, \\"his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.\\" He baptised Jesus in the Jordan, and was eventually killed by Herod Antipas when he called upon the king to reform his evil ways. John was frequently shown in Christian art, identifiable by his bowl, reed cross, camel's skin and lamb. The most popular scene prior to the Counter-Reformation was of John's baptism of Jesus, or else the infant Baptist together with the infant Jesus and Mary his mother, frequently supplemented by the Baptist's own mother St Elizabeth. John alone in the desert was less popular, but not unknown. For the young Caravaggio, John was invariably a boy or youth alone in the wilderness. This image was based on the statement in the Gospel of Luke that \\"the child grew and was strengthened in spirit, and was in the deserts until the day of his manifestation to Israel.\\" These works allowed a religious treatment of the partly clothed youths he liked to paint at this period. Apart from these works showing John alone, mostly dated to his early years, Caravaggio painted three great narrative scenes of John's death: the great Execution in Malta, and two sombre Salomes with his head, one in Madrid, and one in London. ==John the Baptist, Toledo== Sacrifice of Isaac, Caravaggio, c. 1598 (detail showing the head of Isaac). Private collection, Princeton, New Jersey - the resemblance between the two heads suggests that the disputed John the Baptist in Toledo is by the same artist. The ascription of this painting to Caravaggio is disputed - the alternative candidate is Bartolomeo Cavarozzi, an early follower. It is in the collection of the Museo Tesoro Catedralicio, Toledo (Spain), and John Gash speculates that it may have been one of the paintings done by Caravaggio for the prior of the Hospital of the Consolation, as Caravaggio's early biographer Mancini tells us. According to Mancini the prior \\"afterwards took them with him to his homeland\\"; unfortunately, one version of Mancini's manuscript says the prior's homeland was Seville, while another says Sicily. There was a Spanish prior of the hospital in 1593, and he may not have left until June 1595. Gash cites scholar A.E. Perez Sanchez's view that while the figure of the saint has certain affinities with Cavarozzi's style, the rest of the picture does not, \\"and the extremely high quality of certain passages, especially the beautifully depicted vine leaves...is much more characteristic of Caravaggio.\\" Gash also points to the gentle chiaroscuro and the delicate treatment of contours and features, and similar stylistic features in early works by Caravaggio such as The Musicians and Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy. If this and other paintings by Caravaggio were indeed in Seville at an early date they may have influenced Velázquez in his early works. However, the arguments in favour of Cavarozzi are strong, and he is known to have travelled to Spain about 1617–1619. Peter Robb, taking the painting to be by Caravaggio, dates it to about 1598, when the artist was a member of the household of his first patron, Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte. Robb points out that the Baptist is evidently the same boy who modelled for Isaac in the Sacrifice of Isaac, which would date both paintings to around the same period. Unfortunately this Sacrifice of Isaac is also disputed, and so the problem of authorship is not solved. John is shown against a background of green grape vines and thorny vine stems, seated on a red cloak, holding a thin reed cross and looking down at a sheep lying at his feet. The red cloak would become a staple of Caravaggio's works, one with many precedents in previous art. John the Baptist carries over many of the concerns which animated Caravaggio's other work from this period. The leaves behind the figure, and the plants and soil around his feet, are depicted with that careful, almost photographic sense of detail which is seen in the contemporary still life Basket of Fruit, while the melancholy self-absorption of the Baptist creates an atmosphere of introspection. The grape leaves stand for the grapes from which the wine of the Last Supper was pressed, while the thorns call to mind the Crown of Thorns, and the sheep is a reminder of the Sacrifice of Christ. Caravaggio's decision to paint John the Baptist as a youth was somewhat unusual for the age: the saint was traditionally shown as either an infant, together with the infant Jesus and possibly his own and Jesus's mother, or as an adult, frequently in the act of baptising Jesus. Nevertheless, it was not totally without precedent. Leonardo had painted a youthful and enigmatically smiling Baptist with one finger pointing upwards and the other hand seeming to indicate his own breast, while Andrea del Sarto left a Baptist which almost totally prefigures Caravaggio. Both Leonardo and del Sarto had created from the figure of John something which seems to hint at an entirely personal meaning, one not accessible to the viewer, and Caravaggio was to turn this into something like a personal icon in the course of his many variations on the theme. ==John the Baptist (Youth with a Ram), == Amor Vincit Omnia, Caravaggio, c. 1602. Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. Ignudo by Michelangelo, c. 1508–1512. Sistine Chapel, Rome.The model for Amor Vincit was a boy named Cecco, Caravaggio's servant and possibly his pupil as well. He has been tentatively identified with an artist active in Rome about 1610–1625, otherwise known only as Cecco del Caravaggio - Caravaggio's Cecco - who painted very much in Caravaggio's style. The most striking feature of Amor was the young model's evident glee in posing for the painting, so that it became rather more a portrait of Cecco than a depiction of a Roman demi-god. The same sense of the real-life model overwhelming the supposed subject was transferred to Mattei's John the Baptist. The youthful John is shown half-reclining, one arm around a ram's neck, his turned to the viewer with an impish grin. There's almost nothing to signify that this indeed the prophet sent to make straight the road in the wilderness - no cross, no leather belt, just a scrap of camel's skin lost in the voluminous folds of the red cloak, and the ram. The ram itself is highly un-canonical - John the Baptist's animal is supposed to be a lamb, marking his greeting of Christ as the 'Lamb of God' come to take away the sins of mankind. The ram is as often a symbol of lust as of sacrifice, and this naked smirking boy conveys no sense of sin whatsoever. Some biographers have tried to depict Caravaggio as an essentially orthodox Catholic of the Counter-Reformation, but Cecco the Baptist seems as irredeemably pagan as his previous incarnation as Cupid. John the Baptist (Youth with a Ram), c. 1602, 129x94 cm, Doria Pamphilj Gallery, Rome. The Mattei Baptist proved immensely popular - eleven known copies were made, including one recognised by scholars as being from Caravaggio's own hand. It is today held in the Doria Pamphilj GalleryRoma2000 Doria Pamphilj Gallery on the Roman Corso. (The gallery also houses his Penitent Magdalene and Rest on the Flight into Egypt). The collectors ordering the copies would have been aware of a further level of irony: the pose adopted by the model is a clear imitation of that adopted by one of Michelangelo's famous ignudi on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (painted 1508-1512). The role of these gigantic male nudes in Michelango's depiction of the world before the Laws of Moses has always been unclear - some have supposed them to be angels, others that they represent the Neo-Platonic ideal of human beauty - but for Caravaggio to pose his adolescent assistant as one of the Master's dignified witnesses to the Creation was clearly a kind of in-joke for the cognoscenti. Saint John the Baptist, c. 1518, by Raphael - a precedent for Caravaggio's treatment of the BaptistIn 1601/02 Caravaggio was apparently living and painting in the palazzo of the Mattei family, inundated with commissions from wealthy private clients following the success of the Contarelli chapel where in 1600 he had displayed The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew and The Inspiration of Saint Matthew. It was one of the most productive periods in a productive career. Ciriaco Mattei's notebook records two payments to Caravaggio in July and December of that year, marking the beginning and completion of the original John the Baptist. The payment was a relatively modest 85 scudi, because John was a single figure. The copy may have been made at the same time or very soon after. In January of that year Caravaggio received a hundred and fifty scudi for Supper at Emmaus. For Vincenzo Giustiniani there was The Incredulity of Saint Thomas, and in January 1603 Ciriaco paid a hundred and twenty-five scudi for The Taking of Christ. Each of these increased the immense popularity of Caravaggio among collectors - twenty copies survive of the Supper at Emmaus, more of the Taking of Christ. But for all this success, neither the Church itself, nor any of the religious Orders, had yet commissioned anything. The paintings in the Contarelli Chapel had been commissioned and paid for by private patrons, although the priests of San Luigi dei Francesi (which contains the chapel) had had to approve the result. Caravaggio's problem was that the Counter- Reformation Church was extremely conservative - there had been a move to introduce an Index of Prohibited Images, and high-ranking cardinals had published handbooks guiding artists, and more especially the priests who might commission artists or approve art, on what was and was not acceptable. And the playful crypto-paganism of this private John the Baptist with its cross- references to the out of favour Classicising humanism of Michelangelo and the High Renaissance, most certainly was not acceptable. Madonna and Child with St. John the Baptist and Saint by Giovanni Bellini, c. 1500–1504. Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice. ==John the Baptist, == Bellini's Baptist is depicted within a conventional framework that his audience would know and share; Caravaggio's is almost impenetrably private. In 1604 Caravaggio was commissioned to paint a John the Baptist for the papal banker and art patron Ottavio Costa, who already owned the artist's Judith Beheading Holofernes and Martha and Mary Magdalene. Costa intended it for an altarpiece for a small oratory in the Costa fiefdom of Conscente (a village near Albenga, on the Italian Riviera), but liked it so much that he sent a copy to the oratory and kept the original in his own collection. It is now in the Nelson-Atkins Museum in Kansas City. > Stark contrasts of light and dark accentuate the perception that the figure > leans forward, out of the deep shadows of the background and into the > lighter realm of the viewer's own space...The brooding melancholy of the > Nelson-Atkins Baptist has attracted the attention of almost every > commentator. It seems, indeed, as if Caravaggio instilled in this image an > element of the essential pessimism of the Baptist's preaching, of the > senseless tragedy of his early martyrdom, and perhaps even some measure of > the artist's own troubled psyche. The saint's gravity is at least partly > explained, too, by the painting's function as the focal point of the meeting > place of a confraternity whose mission was to care for the sick and dying > and to bury the corpses of plague victims. Caravaggio biographer Peter Robb has pointed out that the fourth Baptist seems like a psychic mirror-image of the first, with all the signs reversed: the brilliant morning light which bathed the earlier painting has become harsh and almost lunar in its contrasts, and the vivid green foliage has turned to dry dead brown. There is almost nothing in the way of symbols to identify that this is indeed a religious image, no halo, no sheep, no leather girdle, nothing but the thin reed cross (a reference to Christ's description of John as \\"a reed shaken by the wind\\"). The painting demonstrates what Robb calls Caravaggio's \\"feeling for the drama of the human presence.\\" This adolescent, almost adult, John seems locked in some private world known only to his creator. Caravaggio's conception of the saint as a seated, solitary figure, lacking almost any narrative identity (how do we know this is the Baptist? What is happening here?) was truly revolutionary. Artists from Giotto to Bellini and beyond had shown the Baptist as an approachable story, a symbol understandable to all; the very idea that a work should express a private world, rather than a common religious and social experience, was radically new. ==John the Baptist, == John the Baptist, Andrea del Sarto, 1528. Pitti Palace, Florence - a precedent for Caravaggio's treatment of the theme, with a similar use of background and symbols.This is one of two John the Baptists painted by Caravaggio in or around 1604 (possibly 1605). It is held in the Palazzo Corsini collection of the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica. Like the John done for Ottavio Costa, the figure has been stripped of identifying symbols - no belt, not even the \\"raiment of camel's hair\\", and the reed cross is only suggested. The background and surrounds have darkened even further, and again there is the sense of a story from which the viewer is excluded. Caravaggio was not the first artist to have treated the Baptist as a cryptic male nude - there were prior examples from Leonardo, Raphael, Andrea del Sarto and others - but he introduced a new note of realism and drama. His John has the roughened, sunburnt hands and neck of a labourer, his pale torso emerging with a contrast that reminds the viewer that this is a real boy who has gotten undressed for his modelling session - unlike Raphael's Baptist, who is as idealised and un-individualised as one of his winged cherubs. Ask who this model actually is, (or was), and the realism of the individual spills over as a record of Rome itself in the age of Caravaggio. Biographer Peter Robb cites Montaigne on Rome as a city of universal idleness, \\"...the envied idleness of the higher clerics, and the frightening idleness of the destitute...a city almost without trades or professions, in which the churchmen were playboys or bureaucrats, the laymen were condemned to be courtiers, all the pretty girls and boys seemed to be prostitutes, and all wealth was inherited old money or extorted new.\\" It was not an age which welcomed an art that emphasised the real. ==John the Baptist (St John the Baptist at the Fountain), == Sleeping Cupid, Caravaggio, 1608. Pitti Palace, Florence - stylistic similarities with the attested Cupid lend support to the disputed John the Baptist at the Fountain. St John the Baptist at the Fountain, in a private collection in Malta, is difficult to gain access to and consequently few scholars have been able to study it. John Gash treats it as by Caravaggio, pointing out the similarity in the treatment of the flesh to the Sleeping Cupid, recognised as by the artist and dating from his Malta period. The painting has been badly damaged, especially in the landscape. The work is known in two other variants, each slightly different. The theme of the young John drinking from a spring reflects the Gospel tradition that the Baptist drank only water during his period in the wilderness. The painting displays typically Caravaggist extreme chiaroscuro (use of light and shadow), and is also typical in taking a young John the Baptist as its subject, this time set in a dark landscape against an ominous patch of lighter sky. \\"The mechanics of drinking and the psychology of thirst are beautifully conveyed through the artful manipulation of limbs and the carefully constructed head\\". If it is in fact by the artist, it would have been painted during his approximately 15 months in Malta in 1607–1608. His recognised works from this period include such masterpieces as the Portrait of Alof de Wignacourt and his Page and The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist. The latter, in the oratory of the Co-Cathedral of Saint John, is the only work that the artist signed. In Malta Caravaggio was accepted into the Order of Saint John (the Knights of Malta) and became in effect their official artist, but his stay ended with a mysterious offense and his expulsion from the Order \\"as a foul and rotten limb\\". The crime on Malta has been the subject of much speculation, but seems to have been extremely serious, possibly even involving the death penalty. Most modern writers believe that it was a crime of violence. His earliest biographer, Giovanni Baglione, said that there had been a \\"disagreement\\" with a knight of justice (i.e., a knight drawn from the European nobility); Giovan Pietro Bellori, who visited Malta to see the Beheading of John the Baptist some fifty years after the event, wrote that Caravaggio \\"had come into conflict with a very noble knight\\", as a result of which he had incurred the displeasure of the Grand Master and had to flee. It is possible that the offence involved a duel, which was regarded very seriously - but the penalty for duelling was imprisonment, not death. The death penalty was imposed for murder - and a death in a duel or brawl equated to murder - but the wording used by both Baglione and Bellori implied that the knight Caravaggio offended had survived. Peter Robb, in his popular biography M, (1998), makes the case for a sexual misdemeanour, but his argument is speculative. ==John the Baptist, == The date of the John the Baptist in the Galleria Borghese is disputed: it was long thought to have been acquired by Cardinal Scipione Borghese some time between his own arrival in Rome in 1605 and Caravaggio's flight from the city in 1606, but Roberto Longhi dated it to the artist's Sicilian period (a date post-1608) on the basis of similarities in handling and colour. Lonhi's view has gained increasing acceptance, with a consensus in favour of 1610 emerging in recent years. The painting shows a boy slumped against a dark background, where a sheep nibbles at a dull brown vine. The boy is immersed in a reverie: perhaps as Saint John he is lost in private melancholy, contemplating the coming sacrifice of Christ; or perhaps as a real-life street-kid called on to model for hours he is merely bored. As so often with Caravaggio, the sense is of both at once. But the overwhelming feeling is of sorrow. The red cloak envelopes his puny childish body like a flame in the dark, the sole touch of colour apart from the pale flesh of the juvenile saint. \\"Compared with the earlier Capitolina and Kansas City versions...the Borghese picture is more richly colouristic - an expressive essay in reds, whites, and golden browns. It also represents a less idealised and more sensuous approach to the male nude, as prefigured in the stout-limbed figures of certain of Caravaggio's post-Roman works, such as the Naples Flagellation and the Valletta Beheading of John the Baptist\\". Borghese was a discriminating collector but notorious for extorting and even stealing pieces that caught his eye - he, or rather his uncle Pope Paul V, had recently imprisoned Giuseppe Cesari, one of the best-known and most successful painters in Rome, on trumped-up charges in order to confiscate his collection of a hundred and six paintings, which included three of the Caravaggios today displayed in the Galleria Borghese (Boy Peeling Fruit, Young Sick Bacchus, and Boy with a basket of Fruit). They joined the Caravaggios that the Cardinal already possessed, including a Saint Jerome and the Madonna and Child with St. Anne (the Grooms' Madonna). By 1610 Caravaggio's life was unravelling. It's always dangerous to interpret an artist's works in terms of his life, but in this case the temptation is overwhelming, and every writer on Caravaggio seems to surrender to it. In 1606 he had fled Rome as an outlaw after killing a man in a street fight; in 1608 he had been thrown into prison in Malta and again escaped; through 1609 he had been pursued across Sicily by his enemies until taking refuge in Naples, where he had been attacked in the street by unknown assailants within days of his arrival. Now he was under the protection of the Colonna family in the city, seeking a pardon that would allow him to return to Rome. The power to grant the pardon lay in the hands of the art-loving Cardinal Borghese, who would expect to be paid in paintings. News that the pardon was imminent arrived in mid-year, and the artist set out by boat with three canvasses. The next news was that he had died \\"of a fever\\" in Porto Ercole, a coastal town north of Rome held by Spain. ==John the Baptist (St John the Baptist Reclining), == This Reclining John the Baptist, is an oil painting by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, built in 1610 and is now kept in a private collection in Munich. This painting is one of the seven versions of the Lombard painter has dedicated to the theme of \\"Saint John\\", that John the Baptist as a child or as a teenager portrait. The canvas is identifiable with the painting that was at Palazzo Cellammare in Naples, at Costanza Colonna, Marchioness of Caravaggio, along with a work of the same subject (the San Giovanni Battista of the Borghese collection) and a Magdalene, as evidenced by the letter the Apostolic Nuncio in the Kingdom of Naples Deodato Gentile to Cardinal Scipione Caffarelli-Borghese in Rome, on July 29, 1610 (Pacelli 1994, pp. 141–155). The three paintings were commissioned by its Borghese and were on the felucca that was supposed to bring their author from Naples to Rome, just before he died. Also from the letter of 29 July that, when Caravaggio was imprisoned in Palo, the paintings were shown to Naples from Costanza Colonna. Scipione Borghese was able to regain possession of one of the two St. John (the one currently on display at the Galleria Borghese ), while St. John's lying seized almost certainly Pedro Fernandez de Castro, VII Count of Lemos and viceroy of Naples from 1610 to 1616.Il painting He arrived in Spain in 1616, when the Count of Lemos, finished the vice-regal office, left for Madrid . Through the steps hereditary within the family went to Don Pedro Antonio, tenth Earl of Lemos, who was appointed viceroy of Peru in 1667 and was certainly responsible for the transfer of St. John lying in Latin America. After being in a private collection of El Salvador and then to Buenos Aires, the painting was brought in Bavaria following a lady of Argentina, just before the Second World War (Marini 2001, p. 574). The canvas was announced by Marini as autograph after the restoration carried out in Rome by Pico Cellini in 1977-78 and dated 1610 (Marini 1978, pp. 23–25, 41-42 illus. 3–5, figs. 15-25 ; Marini 1981, pp. 82 note 117, 45 fig. 10). The chronological position in the very last phase of life of the painter was confirmed not only by zeros (1998, pp. 28–45), in written communications from Stroughton (1987), Pico Cellini (1987), Pepper (1987), Spike ( 1988), Slatkes (1992) and Claudio Strinati (1997), but it should be noted also that Bologna (1992, p. 342) considered the work a copy of a lost original by the Neapolitan church of Sant'Anna dei Lombardi . The hypothesis of the scholar (later ricredutosi Caroli in 1992 where he explicitly identified the painting of Monaco in San Giovanni that the Merisi was carrying on the felucca) is still unfounded, not knowing the original prototype of the Chapel Fenaroli, destroyed in ' old fire of the church, which were destroyed in the other two paintings by Caravaggio: The resurrection of Christ and St. Francis in the act of receiving the stigmata. This painting can not be confused with any other of St. John of Merisi, who have an origin and a commission documented; therefore its connection with the mentioned in the letters of Deodato Gentile to Scipione Borghese is certainly to be welcomed. In the languid pose of St. John are discernible Venetian memories: the reference is specifically to the Venuses and Danae of Giorgione and Titian, but also to the ancient representations of river gods and paintings of the same subject in the Neapolitan area. Writer (Pacelli 1994, pp. 150–151) has pointed out the similarities with the San Giovanni Borghese, the Adoration of Messina, the Martyrdom of Saint Ursula of Intesa Sanpaolo collection in Naples. I have also indicated a significant branch in a relaxed David (now preserved in a private collection in Naples) of unidentified artist, but certainly active in Naples in the first half of the seventeenth century, and in a St. John's Paul Finoglio private collection. At San Giovanni Battista lying was devoted to the recent exhibition at the Museum Het Rembranthuis of Amsterdam between 2010 and 2011: to report in this regard, the publication on exposure, interventions Strinati (2010-2011), Treffers (2010–2011), Pacelli (2010-2011), which traces back the historical and critical of the painting on the basis of the findings in 1994 (pp. 45–51), Marine (2010–11), and Giantomassi Zari (2010–11), which highlight, aspects of painting technique and to restoration. == John the Baptist feeding the Lamb (Private collection, Rome) == End of the first decade of the 17th Century, oil on canvas, 78x122 cm.Italian genius and followers Buenos Aires Herald, December 9, 2012 \\"a work that is shown for the first time after its authenticity was proved\\"Stock Photo - A visitor observes \\"St. John the Baptist Feeding the Lamb\\", a painting by artist Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, at Sao Paulo Art Museum (MASP) August 2, 2012.

The main characters are Diana, a princess- turned-slave, and Sho, her childhood friend who later becomes her master. The two were parted ten years before when Randis, Diana's father, had taken the throne of the kingdom of Doria from Sho's father, King Baasen. Several of Randis' guards then tried to kill the young Sho, Baasen's heir and believed him dead when he fell over the mesa where Doria's castle had been built. Diana watched the attack and tried to let her father know, only to see Randis standing over King Baasen's body. ===Episode 1: The Encounter=== Ten years later, Diana is now the princess of Doria, but hates the position. Her father, now king of Doria, tries to have her married-off to Prince Dunan of the kingdom of Guptia. Diana, however, runs away, fleeing the castle. Disguised as a man, she manages to get a slave called Fina out of a jam and they flee Doria. However, they are soon attacked by creatures as well as nomads. The nomads discover Diana is a girl, but don't listen to her princess story, instead, proceeding to train her and Fina into slaves. While Fina is being trained by the other slaves and Diana is being whipped, a stranger walks by asking where to spend a night, but the nomads want a rumble. The stranger, who is wearing a mask that covers half of his face, kills one of them and is ready to fight the other nomads. However, after one match with the chief, Teo, the stranger is accepted by the tribe and is allowed to spend the night. When the stranger puts away his dagger, Diana immediately recognizes the stranger as her childhood friend Sho, who she thought had died. Diana is then made Sho's slave. Sho also recognizes Diana and after consummating their relationship, along with the help of the nomads, they proceed to take back Doria. ===Episode 2: The Dawn=== Unfortunately, the sadistic Prince Dunan from Gupta manages to kill one of the nomads in order to find the whereabouts of the two. Dunan takes Diana back to Doria, where he violates her. Meanwhile, Sho and the nomads start to take over Doria. During a reunion between Diana and Sho, Duna interrupts but is killed by Diana before he can discover Sho. Afterwards, they go to King Randis and inform him that Doria is being taken over. Randis takes his own life. Sho is made king of Doria but relinquishes the position to Teo. Instead, Sho prepares to travel through the land. When he is ready to begin his journey across the country, Diana comes with him saying she would rather be his slave and be by his side than be free and not be with him. So, they leave Doria and Sho leaves behind his mask. ===Episode 3: The Emergence=== Some time later, they come across a town which is ruled by the rich. These elitists are led by a girl named Patris. Under the request of her uncle, Yajil, Diana and Sho agree to try to improve her attitude. But, unbeknownst to the pair, Yajil is only using them to get Diana. A little encounter between Diana, Patris and the bodyguard Kyle helps Patris change her attitude. Yajil sends Patris on an errand to deliver a document, intending to have Sho killed and Patris enslaved. Diana interferes and, in the process, reveals to Patris that Kyle is in love with her. The group confronts Yajil about his deception, after which he escapes in a cowardly fashion. Kyle leaves also, angry with himself for working with Yajil. Patris, left behind, offers herself as Sho's slave. Diana is reluctant to the idea but accepts the proposition. The next morning, Sho tells Diana to look for Kyle in the bar; she finds him there and tells him to go back to the house. Upon arrival, Kyle and Diana are shocked to find Patris tied up. Sho offers Kyle to take Patris as his slave, a proposal which both Kyle and Patris happily accept. ===Episode 4: The Storm=== Meanwhile, back in Doria, in their desperate search for Dunan, the Guptans try to assassinate Teo, the new king. The siblings, Hanna, who is in love with Gupta's prince Marlon, and Alberto nearly succeed in an assassination attempt but Teo's slave Ulsra manages to save him. Meanwhile, Sho and Diana are in another town where Diana manages to beat Gilman, a chess master and take his slave Shiera. After a night of training, the chess master wants to buy back Shiera. However, Sho tells Gilman there's no need to pay and gladly gives Shiera back to him. Gilman also tells the couple of the assassination attempt. Sho and Diana quickly go back to Doria and start formulating a plan with the king's adviser Imil. Fina is in love with Imil, who later becomes her master after she successfully seduces him. Sho and Diana become the new king and queen of Doria and, while Teo recovers, they must now travel to Gupta and settle the score. ===Episode 5: The Beginning=== En route to Gupta, Marlon plants Hanna as a slave in order to gain information. However, Sho and Diana are aware of Hanna's true purpose and use Hanna's feelings for Marlon to their advantage. When Diana beats Hanna in a match, she tells Hanna to ask Marlon to make her his slave. Marlon is reluctant at first but agrees after some talking with Sho. Later, Sho and Diana admit to killing Dunan. However, even if revenge is taken, the conflict will not end.

The station is located under Karl-Marx-Allee directly east of Straße der Pariser Kommune. Although the next station on the line is called Frankfurter Tor, the historical city gate Frankfurter Tor actually stood at the location of the Weberwiese station. Several of the stations on this line have been recently redeveloped and are now colour-coded. In 2003, Weberwiese station was renovated and now has a very different appearance, with yellow tiles in contrast to its former white ones. ==Overview== The station was opened in 1930 as Memeler Straße station, named after a nearby street, itself named after the town of Memel (today Klaipėda). Its architect was Alfred Grenander, who also designed the other stations of former line E, from Alexanderplatz to Friedrichsfelde, around the same time. Weberwiese is an underground station. Each end has two exits, all opening to Karl-Marx-Allee. The platform itself includes a simple central row of supporting columns. Aside from some variation in the length of the exits, the station is nearly symmetrical, with a form similar to the other stations. During World War II, on 7 May 1944, the east entrance was directly hit. Two bombs were directly hit on 21 June 1944. On 26 February 1945, the station was seriously damaged in a bombing raid and 200 people, mostly women and children, were killed.Die U-Bahn im 2. Weltkrieg , Berliner-Untergrundbahn.de In 1950, following the founding of the German Democratic Republic the station was renamed Marchlewskistraße, after a nearby street named after politician Julian Balthasar Marchlewski (1866–1925), co-founder of the Polish Social Democratic Party. In 1992, after the reunification of Germany, the Berlin Senate decided in 1992 to rename the station again with the current name Weberwiese (weaver's meadow), after a small park near the station. In the mid-1990s, the tiles gradually began to fall from the walls, and the original name Memeler Straße became visible again. With the renovation, these last traces of the past were removed. Falling tiles reveal the original station name before renovation in 2003 A thorough renovation of the section of the U5 between Alexanderplatz and Frankfurter Allee took place in 2003. In addition to work on the line itself, most of the stations were extensively renovated and the old tiles replaced with enamelled metal plates. The asphalt surface of the platforms was also replaced with granite slabs. Two years later, the entrances were also renovated. When it was opened, Weberwiese was the standardbearer for all the stations on the 7 km-long line. After the renovations, it has lost this status. In contrast, Samariterstraße, the only station that retains its original appearance, is now a protected landmark. Due to the lack of bus lines in the area, which could provide barrier-free transportation, the U-Bahn stations on Karl-Marx-Allee and Frankfurter Allee were prioritized in plans to add elevators to subway stations.Schriftliche Anfrage des Unions-Abgeordneten Matthias Brauner bzgl. der Prioritätenliste zum Einbau von Aufzügen, 2 July 2007, Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung A plan from 2007 included an elevator at Weberwiese to be built by 2010.Einzelmaßnahmen bis 2009 , page 197, from Nahverkehrsplan 2006-2009, Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung, 21 August 2007 (pdf) Renovations of the waterproofing above the station have been underway since August 2009, resulting in the temporary closure of both north entrances to the station and the rerouting of westbound traffic on Karl- Marx-Allee onto the greenspaces to the north side of the street. Because the harsh winter of 2009/2010 interrupted construction, it will be completed later than scheduled, tentatively in 2012.Zweiter Bauabschnitt der Tunnelsanierung auf der Karl-Marx-Allee (Second Phase of Construction of the Tunnel Renovation on Karl-Marx-Allee).

It is located underneath Frankfurter Allee, at the intersection with Samariterstraße in the district of Friedrichshain. It was opened as part of the then-extant Line E of the Berlin U-Bahn on 21 December 1930. As the station remains almost in its original condition, it is now protected as a historic building. ==History== In the Second World War, the station was initially spared damage by bombing. However, early in 1945, the Allied bombing of Berlin intensified. During the night of 9 April 1945, the station was struck by multiple bombs leading to the collapse of its roof along almost its entire length. As well as this damage, in early May 1945 the station was flooded as water entered the U-Bahn system. Shortly after the end of the war, water was able to be pumped out of the station, and makeshift repairs made. By 16 June 1945 a provisional shuttle service was running between Petersberger Straße (today Frankfurter Tor) and Friedrichsfelde. During the GDR the station was covered with pictures of SED propaganda that was removed in 1990, together with Neo-Nazism. After 1993 there were anti- violence ads hanging on the walls, put up after a 23-old was killed in this station by right-wingers.J.

The film stars Tom Berenger, Greta Scacchi, Bob Hoskins, Joanne Whalley and Corbin Bernsen.Silver, Alain; Ward, Elizabeth; eds. (1992). Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. ==Plot== While driving at night along the northern California coast, architect Dan Merrick (Tom Berenger) and wife Judith (Greta Scacchi) are involved in a car wreck. Dan suffers major injuries and brain trauma, resulting in psychogenic amnesia. After extensive plastic surgery, Dan returns home in Judith's care. Dan relies on those close to him to help him restore his past, including his business partner Jeb Scott (Corbin Bernsen) and Jeb's wife, Jenny (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer). Dan has frequent flashbacks he believes to be events that led up to the car crash. Dan finds discrepancies in the stories about his former self. He stumbles upon photographs of Judith sleeping with another man. Dan finds an expensive bill to a pet store and follows up with its proprietor, Gus Klein (Bob Hoskins). Gus says the payment was for services provided as a private investigator to follow Judith, and it revealed she was cheating with Jack Stanton (Scott Getlin). Judith arranges a meeting with Stanton and Dan follows her. Judith stops at an old shipwreck slated for removal by Dan's company. Assuming the wreck is a key in remembering his past, Dan has its removal postponed. Jeb's wife Jenny accuses Judith of planning the accident to eliminate Dan. As he works with Gus to keep tabs on his wife with a wiretap, Dan tails her to a hotel where she and Stanton are to meet, but Stanton leaves and a chase ensues through a wooded area. After gunshots are fired from Stanton's car, Dan and Gus crash while Stanton escapes. That night at home, Dan arms himself and lies in wait. At gunpoint, an intruder is revealed as Judith disguised as Stanton. She explains that Stanton is actually dead, killed by Dan on the night of the accident. Judith had intended to stop the affair with Stanton. Judith says she and Dan covered up the murder by disposing of Stanton's body in the shipwreck. When Dan reveals he postponed the ship's removal, Judith becomes hysterical and suggests they should flee. Dan receives a phone call from Jenny imploring him to see her, but when Dan arrives, he finds Jenny dead. He is confronted at gunpoint by Gus, who followed him, thinking Dan must have murdered Stanton. Pleading for his life, Dan convinces Gus to visit the shipwreck, where they find a chemical storage container. Dan dredges up a body of a man who looks exactly like himself. Dan realizes he is not Dan Merrick; he is Jack Stanton. In a flashback, it is revealed that an abusive Dan confronted his wife Judith with evidence of her infidelity. She called for help and Jack raced to her home, arriving too late to prevent her from shooting her husband in the head. Jack wanted to go to the police, but Judith convinced him to cover up the murder and hide Dan's body. After doing so, Jack told Judith he wanted out of the relationship. This angered and distracted Judith, who drove into the car wreck. Judith had banked on the chemical dissolving Dan's body, but because it was actually Formaldehyde, she had preserved it. Gus is shot by Judith, and falls into the water. Judith forces Jack to leave with her. She drives erratically down the same stretch of road from the night of the accident, confessing to the murder of Jenny, saying she had figured everything out and had to be killed. She hid the facts from Jack so he would have plausible deniability. After the crash, she told the plastic surgeons that the man she was with was her husband Dan. Distracted by a police helicopter, Judith loses control of the gun, and Jack grabs it, demanding she stop the car. Judith decides to kill them in a murder-suicide car crash. Jack, at the last second, rolls out, while she plummets to her death. The police helicopter lands, and an injured Gus Klein emerges. Gus survived his plunge into the water after being shot thanks to his asthma inhaler. The two board the helicopter, with Gus referring to Jack as Dan, presumably securing Merrick's fortune for him. The helicopter lifts off, flying over the burning car at the bottom of the cliff. ==Cast== * Tom Berenger as Dan Merrick * Greta Scacchi as Judith Merrick * Bob Hoskins as Gus Klein * Joanne Whalley (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer) as Jenny Scott * Corbin Bernsen as Jeb Scott * Scott Getlin as Jack Stanton * Judi Maddison as Mary Wilson * Bert Rosario as Rudy Costa * Jedda Jones as Sadie * Kellye Nakahara as Lydia * Dierk Torsek as Dr. Benton * Theodore Bikel as Dr. Berkus ==Production== Filming took place in San Francisco and on the northern Oregon coast. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a scored of 36% based on reviews from 14 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. The film's twist ending has caused a division among the responses given by critics. Several critics find the revelation too ridiculous to accept, while others find it inventive and clever. Roger Ebert falls into the former category, stating that the film's resolution is \\"inconceivably implausible\\", and that the \\"screenplay is too clever by half\\". However, he goes on to say that this quality \\"is always sort of fun.\\" About.com falls into the latter category, calling the finale \\"a killer twist ending!\\" and The Washington Post says, \\"It would be disastrous to even hint at the movie's denouement; a critic could get lynched for giving away an ending as shockingly unexpected as the one here. Let's just say that it blows the top of your head off.\\" Despite this division, critics generally hold the film's surprise denouement as unexpected and startling. ==Technical notes== * Awards: Deauville Film Festival - Nominated - Critics Award. * Film Locations: ** Oregon: Nehalem, Tillamook County; Oswald West State Park; Neahkahnie Mountain. ** California: Mount Tamalpais State Park, Marin County; City and County of San Francisco; Sausalito, Marin County. * Release Date: October 11, 1991 * Box Office: ** Opening Weekend: $3,457,105 (1,286 theaters, $2,688 average) ** Total Gross: $11,511,031 * Songs Used: ** Nights in White Satin by The Moody Blues ** Hacienda Source by Ashley Irwin ==References== == External links == * * Category:1991 films Category:1991 independent films Category:1990s mystery drama films Category:1990s mystery thriller films Category:1990s psychological thriller films Category:1990s thriller drama films Category:Adultery in films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American mystery drama films Category:American mystery thriller films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:American thriller drama films Category:Davis Entertainment films Category:Films about amnesia Category:Films about road accidents and incidents Category:Films based on mystery novels Category:Films directed by Wolfgang Petersen Category:Films scored by Alan Silvestri Category:Films set in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Films shot in Oregon Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:American neo-noir films Category:1991 drama films ","title":"Shattered (1991 film)"},{"id":"3229743","text":"River Edge is a New Jersey Transit rail station on the Pascack Valley Line.

The station is also part of the Berlin S-Bahn and U-Bahn ( line) network. During the division of the city, Lichtenberg with its extended railyards became the central transport facility of East Berlin, together with Berlin Ostbahnhof. Today, the station mainly provides regional rail service to the eastern and northern environs. ==Overview== Railway tracks, view from Lichtenberger Brücke The station building marks the southeastern border of the Lichtenberg quarter and is primarily accessible from the Weitlingstraße neighbourhood in the adjacent Rummelsburg locality. North of it, the Frankfurter Allee, part of the Bundesstraße 1/5 highway, crosses the tracks on the eight-lane Lichtenberger Brücke (Lichtenberg Bridge). Until 2006, international trains to Kaliningrad, Warsaw, Kiev, Minsk, Moscow and Siberia (among others Omsk, Novosibirsk and Kazakhstan) used to stop at Berlin-Lichtenberg. However, after the completion of Berlin Hauptbahnhof, these trains now stop there. Night trains from all parts of Germany still terminate at this station, however, as do some trains from Warsaw and Kraków. Lichtenberg was featured in the opening scene of the 2007 movie The Bourne Ultimatum where it was made to look like a Moscow train station. ==History== A first marshalling yard at the site was late out in the 1870s, following the opening of the Prussian Eastern Railway line to Strausberg and Küstrin in 1867 and the first sections of the Berlin Ringbahn at nearby Ostkreuz station in 1871. Passenger trains stopped here from 1881 onwards; the station was renamed Lichtenberg-Friedrichsfelde the next year. Long-distance trains, however, ran via Schlesischer Bahnhof (the present-day Ostbahnhof) to the central Berlin Stadtbahn line. The Wriezen Railway branch- off was opened in 1898. After the area was incorporated into Berlin by the 1920 Greater Berlin Act, Lichtenberg received access to the electrified S-Bahn commuter rail network in 1928. The subway station, built in the New Objectivity style according to plans designed by Alfred Grenander, was opened on 21 December 1930. Zentralfriedhof ('Central Cemetery') was then added to the name; from 1935 the station was called \\"Bahnhof Lichtenberg\\". During World War II, it served as an air raid shelter. Train services ceased during the Battle of Berlin on 23 April 1945, but were resumed only a month later under Soviet occupation. Passenger tunnel After the war, the Deutsche Reichsbahn authority had Lichtenberg gradually rebuilt as the main train station of East Berlin, providing direct connections with the Ringbahn line and the Berlin outer ring.

Fishman - Role of Computer Technology in Medical Illustration AJR December 2000 vol. 175 no. 6 1519-1524 Retrieved 2012-12-20 in any case for hundreds (or thousands) of years. Many illuminated manuscripts and Arabic scholarly treatises of the medieval period contained illustrations representing various anatomical systems (circulatory, nervous, urogenital), pathologies, or treatment methodologies. Many of these illustrations can look odd to modern eyes, since they reflect early reliance on classical scholarship (especially Galen) rather than direct observation, and the representation of internal structures can be fanciful. An early high- water mark was the 1543 CE publication of Andreas Vesalius's De Humani Corporis Fabrica Libri Septum, which contained more than 600 exquisite woodcut illustrations based on careful observation of human dissection. Since the time of the Leonardo da Vinci and his depictions of the human form, there have been great advancements in the art of representing the human body. The art has evolved over time from illustration to digital imaging using the technological advancements of the digital age. Berengario da Carpi was the first known anatomist to include medical illustration within his textbooks. Gray's Anatomy, originally published in 1858, is one well-known human anatomy textbook that showcases a variety of anatomy depiction techniques. In 1895, Konrad Roentgen, a German physicist discovered the X-Ray. Internal imaging became a reality after the invention of the X-Ray. Since then internal imaging has progressed to include ultrasonic, CT, and MRI imaging. As a profession, medical illustration has a more recent history. In the late 1890s, Max Brödel, a talented artist from Leipzig, was brought to The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore to illustrate for Harvey Cushing, William Halsted, Howard Kelly, and other notable clinicians. In addition to being an extraordinary artist, he created new techniques, such as carbon dust, that were especially suitable to his subject matter and then-current printing technologies. In 1911 he presided over the creation of the first academic department of medical illustration, which continues to this day. His graduates spread out across the world, and founded a number of the academic programs listed below under \\"Education\\". Notable medical illustrators include Max Brödel and Dr. Frank H. Netter. For an online inventory of scientific illustrators including currently already more than 1000 medical illustrators active 1450-1950 and specializing in anatomy, dermatology and embryology, see the Stuttgart Database of Scientific Illustrators 1450–1950 Medical illustration is used in the history of medicine. ==Profession== Medical illustrators not only produce such material but can also function as consultants and administrators within the field of biocommunication. A certified medical illustrator continues to obtain extensive training in medicine, science, and art techniques throughout his or her career. The Association of Medical Illustrators is an international organization founded in 1945, and incorporated in Illinois. Its members are primarily artists who create material designed to facilitate the recording and dissemination of medical and bioscientific knowledge through visual communication media. Members are involved not only in the creation of such material, but also serve in consultant, advisory, educational and administrative capacities in all aspects of bioscientific communications and related areas of visual education. The professional objectives of the AMI are to promote the study and advancement of medical illustration and allied fields of visual communication, and to promote understanding and cooperation with the medical profession and related health science professions. The AMI publishes an annual Medical Illustration Source Book which is distributed to creative and marketing professionals that regularly hire medical/scientific image makers for editorial, publishing, educational and advertising projects. There is a companion Source Book with searchable illustration, animation and multimedia portfolios from hundreds of artists in the field. The obvious abilities necessary are to be able to visualize the subject-matter, some degree of originality in style of drawing and the refined skill of colour discrimination.nih.gov Retrieved 2012-12-20 ==Education== Most medical illustrators in the profession have a master's degree from an accredited graduate program in medical illustration or another advanced degree in either science or the arts. The Association of Medical Illustrators is a sponsor member of CAAHEP (Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs), the organization that grants accreditation to the graduate programs in medical illustration upon recommendation of ARC-MI (Accreditation Review Committee for the Medical Illustrator) which is a standing committee of the AMI and a Committee on Accreditation of CAAHEP. Currently there are four accredited Programs in North America: The Department of Art as Applied to Medicine on the East Baltimore Campus of the world-famous Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions was the first program of its kind in the world. Endowed in 1911, the program has been in existence for over 90 years. In 1959, the Johns Hopkins University approved a two-year graduate program leading to the university-wide degree of Master of Arts in Medical and Biological Illustration. The academic calendar, faculty and student affairs are administered by The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The program has been fully accredited since 1970, currently accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP). The Biomedical Visualization Program at the University of Illinois at Chicago's College of Applied Health Sciences is the second oldest school of medical illustration in the western hemisphere, founded in 1921 by Thomas Smith Jones (Jones also was co-founder of the Association of Medical Illustrators). The UIC program is located in the national healthcare and pharmaceutical hub of Chicago, and offers a market-based curriculum that includes the highest ends of technology (including the renowned Virtual Reality Medical Laboratory and a rigorous animation curriculum). Biomedical Visualization is located on the UIC Medical Center campus, home of the largest medical school in the United States. The UIC program blends the more traditional aspects of medical illustration and the emerging markets of digital, pharmaceutical, and \\"edutainment\\" industries. UIC also offers an extensive study in the field of anaplastology (facial and somatic prosthetics), medical sculpture, and an international internship program is available. A two-year Master of Science (MS) in Biomedical Visualization degree is awarded, and the program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP). The Medical Illustration Graduate Program at Augusta University (formerly the Medical College of Georgia), in Augusta, Georgia is fully accredited by CAAHEP. Graduates receive a Master of Science in Medical Illustration. The first Master of Science degree in Medical Illustration at MCG was awarded in 1951. The program emphasizes anatomical and surgical illustration for print and electronic publication, as well as for projection and broadcast distribution. Because of the importance of good drawing skills, the students learn a variety of traditional illustration techniques during the first year. In addition, computer technologies and digital techniques, used to prepare both vector and raster images for print and motion media, are well and extensively integrated into the curriculum. The Biomedical Communications Program at the University of Toronto. This program was begun in 1945 by Maria Wishart, a student of Max Brödel's. Faculty and graduates of the program contributed the drawings for Grant's Atlas of Anatomy, a renowned guide to dissection, structure, and function for medical students. The current two-year professional Master's program, offered through the Institute of Medical Science, emphasizes a research-based approach to the creation and evaluation of visual material for health promotion, medical education, and the process of scientific discovery. The Biomedical Communication Graduate Program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center was the first school in the world to offer a graduate degree in medical illustration in 1945. Lewis Boyd Waters, who studied under Max Brodel at Johns Hopkins in the 1920s, was a founding member of the medical school and was responsible for starting the master's program. Waters died in 1969 and was later succeeded by several of his students who continued and expanded the program. The program was designed to be an interdisciplinary program that provides opportunities for development of the skills and knowledge needed in the application of communications arts and technology to the health sciences. The program closed in 2012. ==Technique== Medical illustrators create medical illustrations using traditional and digital techniques which can appear in medical textbooks, medical advertisements, professional journals, instructional videotapes and films, animations, web-based media, computer-assisted learning programs, exhibits, lecture presentations, general magazines and television. Although much medical illustration is designed for print or presentation media, medical illustrators also work in three dimensions, creating anatomical teaching models, patient simulators, games, and facial prosthetics. The traditional tools of medical illustration are slowly being replaced and supplemented by a range of unique modern artistic practices. Three-dimensional renders and endoscopic cameras are replacing carbon dust and cadavers. ==Additional images== File:Anencephaly-web.jpgIllustration from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Anencephaly.

The game was released as a sequel to the previous title, Puyo Pop Fever. The gameplay remains relatively unchanged, but several new modes are introduced. The game features nine different plots, each one pertaining to its three protagonists. Puyo Puyo Fever 2 was released exclusively in Japan for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable in November 2005, and later for the Nintendo DS the following month. ==Gameplay== Unlike Puyo Pop Fever, which uses a simple menu, Puyo Puyo Fever 2 uses a map system to let the player navigate the game's menus. The map system is also reused in the nine courses to show the supposed path of the player's character. Several buildings are available around the map area, known as Primp Town, which was the setting of the previous game. These buildings include a tower for endless modes, a shop to buy items, a town hall to change options and save, a museum for viewing unlocked media and a playground for multiplayer games. You can also explore these areas and talk to the respective characters, where they may distribute items. Items can be used in each course. The game boasts nine courses, three times that of the previous title. The courses in the game work in much the same fashion as those of the previous game, with the addition of the aforementioned map screen to show the player's route so far. Each part of the story involves a segment of dialog followed by a Puyo battle, with the exception of the ending sequence of each course. Gameplay mechanics remain mainly unchanged; however, the aforementioned items system allows the player to perform various different functions. Common items can be exchanged for points at Oshare Bones' shop. The game also includes a save system which is not used in any other game to date. It allows three concurrent save files, and lets players save at the beginning of any Puyo battle in story mode, so a player does not have to finish an entire course at once but can stop partway through. ===Multiplayer=== As in every Puyo Puyo game, this game allows multiplayer, and can support 2 to 8 players in the DS version of the game; other versions can only support up to 4 players. In this mode, players can play as any available character. ===Endless modes=== There are five endless modes in the game. Three of the endless modes were previously available in Puyo Pop Fever: Endless Fever, Endless Task, and Endless Original. Two new endless modes are also introduced: Endless Battle and Endless Chu Panic. The latter is the only mode in which Chu Puyo appear; Chu Puyo perform the same function as ordinary ojama (garbage, nuisance) puyo, in that they take up space in the player's dungeon and cannot be cleared unless normal puyo are cleared near them. Chu Puyo are heart-shaped and colored pink; chu is Japanese onomatopoeia for kissing. ==References== ==External links== * Official Japanese Website Category:2005 video games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:Puyo Puyo Category:Sega arcade games Category:Sega video games Category:Sonic Team games Category:Fictional trios Category:Video game sequels Category:Japan-exclusive video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring female protagonists ","title":"Puyo Puyo Fever 2"},{"id":"3229783","text":"Dennison is an unincorporated community in Wabash Township in the northeast corner of Clark County, Illinois, east of Illinois Route 1 and north of Interstate 70. == Geography == Dennison is located at 39°27'39\\" North, 87°35'52\\" West (39.4608688, -87.5978025). ==References== ==External links== * Dennison History at Genealogy Trails.

W. Denslow in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) Winged monkeys (often referred to in adaptations and popular culture as flying monkeys) are fictional characters created by American author L. Frank Baum in his children's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900). They are jungle monkeys with bird-like feathered wings. They are most notably remembered from the famous 1939 musical film by MGM. Ever since, they have taken their own place in popular culture, regularly referenced in comedic or ironic situations as a source of evil or fear. ==Classic Oz media== ===In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900)=== The winged monkeys started out as free creatures living in the jungles in the Land of Oz. They were a rather carefree but mischievous bunch, until their king, as a prank, tossed a richly dressed man into a deep river, ruining his velvet costume. His fiancée, Princess Gayelette, was furious since this was their wedding day. She had ruled Oz's northern quadrant, Gillikin Country, and was a sorceress; as punishment for the prank, she enslaved them and made them obey the Golden Cap. Any wearer of the cap could make three demands of the monkeys. Later, this cap fell into the hands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who used it to make the monkeys help her in conquering Oz's western quadrant (the Winkie Country), enslave the native Winkies, and drive the Wizard of Oz out of her territory when he attempted to overthrow her. After Dorothy Gale kills the Wicked Witch, she put on the cap, unaware of its power, and when she learns its power she uses it to make the winged monkeys to carry her and her companions to the Emerald City. Then Dorothy asked them to carry her back to Kansas, but the winged monkeys could not leave the magical realm of Oz; thus the second request was wasted. Dorothy's third and final request was for them to carry her and her company over the rocky mountains inhabited by the Hammer-Heads, who would not let them pass over their turf. Dorothy ends up handing the Golden Cap over to Glinda, the beautiful Good Witch of the South. Glinda then ordered the winged monkeys to carry Dorothy's companions back to their new homes in Oz after Dorothy's departure, and then to simply cease to bother people and not play pranks on them anymore. She then gave the winged monkeys the cap as their own, breaking the curse and setting them free. ===The Wizard of Oz (1939)=== In the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, the monkeys are apparently intelligent enough to obey commands, but do not speak, though they do in the book. They abduct Dorothy and dismantle the Scarecrow, but do nothing to the Tin Man or the Cowardly Lion, leaving them free to put the Scarecrow back together and rescue Dorothy. There is no mention of any three wishes in the film, suggesting that the monkeys serve the witch unconditionally. Nikko (the head monkey, played by Pat Walshe) is shown again after the Witch orders him to throw a basket containing the dog Toto in the river (an order that Dorothy prevents him from carrying out), with the Witch as she angrily throws down the hour glass after the trio rescues Dorothy, and once more after the Witch has been melted. There is only a brief glimpse of the Golden Cap in the film: after Dorothy and the Lion reawake after Glinda breaks the spell on the poppies conjured by the Witch, she is seen watching them in anger in her crystal ball. Nikko hands her the Golden Cap and she utters the \\"somebody always helps that girl\\" line, before throwing the cap across the room angrily. The reason for this brief appearance comes from a scene deleted from the final film. In the script, after the Witch conjures up the poppies that put Dorothy, Toto and the Lion to sleep she orders Nikko to fetch the Golden Cap so she can summon the winged monkeys and they can take the Ruby Slippers from the sleeping girl. However, she never gets a chance as the spell is broken before she can. Why the Witch doesn't use the Golden Cap to summon the monkeys when she sends them off into the Winkie Forest to capture Dorothy and Toto is unknown. In the film, the cap looks almost identical to the original artwork by Denslow in the book. ==Legacy== * In Disney's 1996 The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Laverne is seen shouting to a flock of pigeons flying to the guards, \\"Fly my pretties, fly!\\" with background music that strongly resembles the music in the 1939 Wizard of Oz scene when the Wicked Witch sends out the flying monkey bats to capture Dorothy. * In the film version of The Wiz, the African-American rock adaptation of The Wizard of Oz, the flying monkeys are a motorcycle gang, whose leader is named Cheetah, after the Tarzan character. Their metal wings are part of their motorcycles, but these apparently dissolved with the witch's other magic, as they are absent when carrying Dorothy and her friends back to the Emerald City. * In 1976, two statues of winged monkeys were erected on the rooftop of a mattress store called \\"Emerald City of Oz\\" in Burlington, Vermont. In 1996, the statues were moved to the roof of Union Station (now Main Street Landing), and statues of baby monkeys were added in the winter of 2004–2005. Two more statues of winged monkeys were installed on the roof of the nearby Waterfront Theatre in the 1990s. * The winged monkeys subsequently appear in the early 1990s cartoon version of The Wizard of Oz, with one of them named Truckle (voiced by Pat Fraley) serving as the Wicked Witch of the West's chief sidekick. He is shown as capable of speech and even gets to wear the Ruby Slippers for a brief time. Truckle led the winged monkeys that were loyal to the Wicked Witch of the West into performing a ritual that would resurrect her. * In Gregory Maguire's revisionist novels Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West and Son of a Witch, the flying monkeys were created by Elphaba (the Witch) as part of her experiments on the nature of the soul and what distinguishes non- speaking animals from Animals. In these novels, most of the flying monkeys cannot speak, but Elphaba's favorite (named Chistery), has a distinctive speech pattern characterized by the repetition of similar-sounding words. This speech pattern becomes less pronounced in A Lion Among Men and Out of Oz, the third and fourth volumes in Maguire's \\"Wicked Years\\" cycle. * In The Muppets' Wizard of Oz, the winged monkeys had been a rather peaceful group of \\"motorcycle enthusiasts\\" and are played by Sal Minella, Sweetums, Crazy Harry, Black Dog, Calico, Old Tom, Spotted Dick, and Aretha from Fraggle Rock. The winged monkeys were placed under the Wicked Witch of the West's control when she took possession of their Magic Biker Cap. Forced to do her bidding, the winged monkeys rode their motorcycles through the skies of Oz, performing the Wicked Witch of the West's dirty work. Once she was defeated upon melting in a bathtub filled with tap water, Dorothy returned the Magic Biker Cap to Sal Minella, thereby restoring the winged monkeys' independence. * The 2007 Sci Fi television miniseries Tin Man depicts a re-imagining of Baum's world of Oz, including bat-winged monkeys called \\"mobats\\" that are the familiars of the sorceress Azkadellia which come from tattoos on her chest. * In Bill Willingham's Vertigo comic book series Fables, a winged monkey named Bufkin is a clerk and librarian in the Business Office belonging to the government of Fabletown, a community of refugee fairy-tale characters (\\"Fables\\") living in modern-day New York City. It has yet to be revealed how he became a citizen of Fabletown, but it is known that Oz is one of the mythical \\"Homelands\\" conquered by the Adversary that forced many Fables to flee to the \\"real\\" world, and was given over to the Nome King to rule in the Adversary's name. Though somewhat scatter-brained, lacking in wisdom, and partial to alcohol when he can find it, Bufkin has a surprising amount of knowledge gleaned from the vast array of reference material in the library. After becoming separated from Fabletown and losing his wings in a conflict with the witch Baba Yaga, Bufkin eventually makes his way back to the lands of the Oz books, and in the wake of the Adversary's defeat by Fabletown, leads an uprising that deposes the Nome King's rule. Bufkin goes on to have other adventures across the Homelands before settling down in his old age and dying of natural causes. * Winged monkeys or flying monkeys have been mentioned in television series such as The Simpsons, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Two and a Half Men, and have appeared or been referenced in films such as Hunter, Wayne's World, Jumanji and Inkheart. * The winged monkeys appear in Dorothy and the Witches of Oz. * Beyond Oz, winged apes called \\"clakars\\" appear in While the Gods Laugh by Michael Moorcock, the second published novelette featuring his character Elric of Melniboné; the novelette was later republished in different collections. * In the 2012 film The Avengers, Nick Fury calls Hawkeye and Erik Selvig (who had been hypnotized at the start of the film) two of Loki's flying monkeys. At this remark, the Asgardian hero Thor (who does not originate from Earth) is confused, not having read or seen The Wizard of Oz, whilst Captain America excitedly announces that he understood the reference, having come from a source from before he was frozen during World War II. * The winged monkeys appear in Oz the Great and Powerful. Oscar Diggs befriended a winged monkey named Finley (voiced by Zach Braff) after using an illusion to save him from a lion. The film also included Winged Baboons which make up the armies of Theodora and Evanora. Unlike Finley who can speak and behave like a human, the Winged Baboons are feral, vicious and cannot speak. The Baboons have leathery bat-like wings, whereas Finley has elegant wings like a swan. * In the music video \\"Heretics and Killers\\" by Canadian band Protest The Hero, the band is seen performing in the monkey suits. A newspaper at the beginning also indicates the monkeys are out of work so they try working and other things to make money. * The winged monkeys appear in the third season of Once Upon a Time. The Wicked Witch of the West sends one out to collect a sample of the Evil Queen's blood for her potion. The Wicked Witch sent a winged monkey to make her presence known to the Evil Queen. Before it can attack Robin Hood's son Roland, the Evil Queen turned it into a plush toy and gave it to Roland. Another winged monkey assumes the form of a man named Walsh (played by Christopher Gorham) and becomes in a relationship with Emma Swan for eight months. However, when she declines his marriage proposal to go to Storybrooke, he reveals his true form and attacks Emma. Emma fights back and knocks him off a building, though he vanishes into smoke before he can hit the ground. When Emma is back in Storybrooke, the winged monkeys start taking its inhabitants one by one in order to be converted into winged monkeys. In \\"It's Not Easy Being Green\\", it was revealed that Walsh was the previous Wizard of Oz before being turned into a flying monkey by the Wicked Witch of the West. After the Wicked Witch's defeat, everyone who was turned into a flying monkey return to their human forms. * The winged monkeys appeared in the 2013 animated film Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return (based on Dorothy of Oz) with their vocal effects provided by Scott Menville, Alan Shearman, Randi Soyland, and Flip Waterman. The winged monkeys are servants of the Jester where the flying monkey named \\"You\\" (voiced by Randi Soyland) is his main servant. * A winged monkey skin exists for Brightwing in Heroes of the Storm. More of the creatures are said to inhabit its Luxorian setting. * The flying monkeys appear in the Lego Dimensions video game. The flying monkeys are only affected by their master the Wicked Witch of the West, witnessed the disappearing of Dorothy via the vortex and battle Gandalf, Batman, and Wyldstyle. * In a Danny Shanahan cartoon from the New Yorker (September 26, 2016), a surgeon tells a flying monkey that the witch is dead by touching him on the shoulder and saying, \\"Ding-dong.\\" * The flying monkeys also make a cameo appearance in The Lego Batman Movie. They appear alongside the Wicked Witch of the West and various other villains in the Phantom Zone. One of the Monkeys spoke during the film where he told Joker to get on with his plan to get out of the Phantom Zone. The flying monkeys are later seen alongside the other villains attacking Gotham City. * In the ITV (and PBS) sitcom Vicious, Freddie (Ian McKellen), who incessantly insults Mildred (Hazel Stewart), the mother of his partner Stuart (Derek Jacobi), observes that one can be sure that Stuart's mother has indeed arrived if one looks out the window and sees flying monkeys. * The Flying Monkeys appear in Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz. Some of them are on the side of the Wicked Witch of the West's niece Wilhemina and are often led by Wilhelmina's Flying Monkey minions Frank and Lyman (voiced by Steve Blum and Jess Harnell). * In the third volume of Shazam!, the winged monkeys are shown as inhabitants of the Magiclands location called the Wozenderlands. Working for the Wicked Witches of the North, South, East, and West, they pursue the White Rabbit in order to take him prisoner. The White Rabbit runs from the winged monkeys and is saved from them by Mamaragan, Eugene Choi, and Pedro Peña.Shazam! Vol. 3 #7.

Although this document was dismissed by contemporaries as evidence of Brown's madness, David Reynolds points out that at the time, the U.S. Constitution itself was \\"a highly contexted text\\". It was rejected by the abolitionists Wm. Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips, who called it \\"a covenant with death and an agreement from hell\\" because it indirectly sanctioned slavery, as the Dred Scott decision had just confirmed. The first Constitution of the Confederacy was a Provisional Constitution. ==Projected use of the constitution== Just what the provisional constitution was for is not completely clear. It was not intended for use in Harpers Ferry, as it was not distributed there. We have no record of any comments by Brown on how and when it was to be distributed and used. \\"John Brown never...communicated his whole plan, even to his immediate followers. ...With characteristic reticence Brown revealed his whole plan to no one, and many of those close to him received quite different impressions, or rather read their own ideas into Brown's careful speech.\\" http://www.wvculture.org/history/wvmemory/images/jb/SC02-0019C.jpg It was not the constitution of a projected new state, made up of the mountanous regions of the mid-Atlantic states, that would join or seek to join the Union. He also denied, in his trial, the intent of revolting against the United States, of creating a new country. Sometimes he seems to want the same United States—he does describe it in the constitution's title as \\"for the people of the United States\\"—buf with a better and anti-slavery constitution. This proposed one was only \\"provisional\\", which implies some sort of procedure to create a new, permanent constitution. Under Brown's provisional constitution, there would be a unicameral legislature of no less than 5 nor more than 10 members, all chosen at large. There would be no senate. Brown did not see setting up another government with a different constitution to be a revolt against the United States. The Provisional Constitution was cited during the trial as evidence of his intent to commit treason. It called for a new state in the Appalachian Mountains, a sort of West Virginia, populated by escaped slaves from plantations, which were at lower altitudes. Not one of the copies was ever distributed; even nearby enslaved persons did not receive copies. The reason for this has never been explained. Although it was reprinted, always with scorn, in the press, Brown was not asked about it by any of the many visitors he saw during the month (November 2–December 2, 1859) between being sentenced to death (in Virginia v. John Brown) and his execution. Much of the Constitution was reprinted in the Wheeling Daily Intelligencer shortly after his arrest. In the pockets of William H. Leeman, one of the rebels killed at Harpers Ferry, was found a commission as captain \\"in the army established under the provisional constitution\\". It was signed by John Brown, Commander in Chief, at the \\"War Department, near Harpers Ferry\\", dated October 15. The commission was a preprinted form, with Lehman's name filled in by hand. ==References== ==External links== * John Brown's Provisional Constitution - Full Text Category:John Brown (abolitionist) Category:Provisional constitutions Category:1858 documents ","title":"John Brown's Provisional Constitution"},{"id":"3229809","text":"Cartagena and Barranquilla, based on the one for Cartagena State after 1811 and used provisionally for the United Provinces from 1813 to 1814In Spanish: Colombia. \\"La bandera colombiana.\\" Presidencia de la República. Flag of the United Provinces, 1814-1816 The Foolish Fatherland is the period in the history of Colombia immediately following the declaration of independence from Spain in 1810 and until the Spanish reconquest in 1816. The period between 1810 and 1816 in the Viceroyalty of New Granada (which included present-day Colombia) was marked by such intense conflicts over the nature of the new government or governments that it became known as la Patria Boba (the Foolish Fatherland). Constant fighting between federalists and centralists gave rise to a prolonged period of instability that eventually favored Spanish reconquest. Similar developments can be seen at the same time in the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. Each province, and even some cities, set up its own autonomous junta, which declared themselves sovereign from each other. ==Establishment of juntas, 1810== With the arrival of news in May 1810 that southern Spain had been conquered by Napoleon's forces, that the Spanish Supreme Central Junta had dissolved itself and that juntas had been established in Venezuela, cities in New Granada (modern-day Colombia) began to do the same and established their own. Antonio Villavicencio had been sent by the Spanish Cortes as a commissioner of the Regency Council of Spain and the Indies, a sort of ambassador of the Regency to the provinces. Villavicencio arrived to Cartagena de Indias on May 8, 1810, finding the city in political turmoil. Villavicencio used his appointment as commissioner to call for an open cabildo, which stimulated the creation of many provincial juntas just as the one that had been established in Cadiz. On May 22, 1810, with Villavicencio's support, the open council forced Cartagena's governor to acquiesce to a co-government with two people chosen by the council, and then ousted the governor on June 14, establishing a government junta instead. This elicited the creation of similar juntas all over the viceroyalty: Cali on July 3, Pamplona the next day, and Socorro on July 10. On July 20, the viceregal capital, Santa Fe de Bogotá, established its own junta. (The day is today celebrated as Colombia's Independence Day.) The viceroy Antonio José Amar y Borbón initially presided over the junta in Bogotá, but due to popular pressure, he was deposed five days later. Following the creation of the Supreme Governing Junta of Santa Fe, other juntas were established in Honda in July, Antioquia, Popayán, Neiva, Quibdó and Nóvita in August and September, and then Tunja in October. By then, smaller provinces and cities started making claims for larger autonomy within the provinces, as can be seen in the decision by the council of Mompós to disavow the authority of the Cartagena junta and to declare independence on August 6, or those by the recently established \\"Friend Cities of the Cauca Valley\\", between 1811 and 1812.Officially the cities called themselves the Ciudades amigas del Valle del Cauca; historians refer to them as the \\"Confederated Cities of the Valle del Cauca.\\" Zawadzky C., Alfonso. Comentario al libro Las Ciudades Confederadas del Valle del Cauca. (Bogotá: Editorial Librería Voluntad, S.A., 1943). These juntas made a case over their legality and legitimacy within the monarchy, and declared loyalty to Ferdinand VII, to the Catholic church, and to maintain ties with Spain. Although the Bogotá junta called itself the \\"Supreme Junta of the New Kingdom of Granada,\\" the splintering of political authority continued as even secondary cities set up juntas that claimed to be independent of their provincial capitals, resulting in military conflicts. There were two fruitless attempts at establishing a congress of provinces in the subsequent months. ==First independent states and civil war== Current flag of the Department of Cundinamarca, based on the one used for the State of Cundinamarca, 1813–1814.In Spanish: Colombia. \\"La bandera colombiana.\\" Presidencia de la República.

In New Granada, the elites in the main cities were divided in regard to the support toward the government in Spain, with the juntas supporting sovereignty and other cities instead supporting Ferdinand VII and the regal authorities commanded by the Regency Council of Spain. Royalist factions commanded by Spanish officers managed to seize power in the cities of Santa Marta, Panamá (by then, still a part of the vice-royalty of New Granada), Popayán and Pasto, and soon engaged in conflict against the regions with autonomous governments. While the royalist regions were military weak and were often defeated by the juntas, they managed to become a source of destabilization which both maintained the idea of reconciliation with Spain alive, and drained the resources and energy of the patriotic governments. Some of these royalist cities became fundamental later in the military campaign for the reconquest of New Granada. Such division hence prevented the creation of a unified state in New Granada. In addition to this, the provincial juntas were also divided on the question of the type of government that the new state should have. Disagreements on whether there should be a single state in the place of the old New Kingdom of Granada or whether the provinces should become autonomous and independent states became a matter of heated debate. The Supreme Junta of Santafé (in modern-day Bogotá) assumed that it would inherit the authority of the old regime, as it was the most prosperous and populated province in the vice-royalty, and it was in fact the seat of the Spanish viceroyalty. When the Cartagena junta called for a separate General Conference in Medellín, where each province would be represented in proportion to their populations, the Supreme Junta of Santafé decided to counter by inviting each province to send a delegate to form an interim government while a general congress was summoned to establish a Constitutional Assembly for the whole New Granada. The congress was irregular from the start as it was formed by delegates from barely a handful of provinces (Santa Fe, Socorro, Neiva, Pamplona, Nóvita, and Mariquita), and was deeply divided on whether the cities of Mompós (part of the Cartagena province) and Sogamoso, which had sent delegates, should be considered provinces. In the congress, held between December 22, 1810, and February 2, 1811, Antonio Nariño became the leader of a push to establish Congress in Santafé, a proposal that was rejected by the remaining provinces, which saw in this a push for deferral to Santafé. The Congress was finally dissolved amid disagreements when the members stopped attending the sessions. In the meantime, under the guidance of Jorge Tadeo Lozano, the province of Santafé transformed itself into a state called the Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca. In March, 1811, it convened a \\"Constituent Electoral College of the State of Cundinamarca,\\" which promulgated a constitution for the state the following month. The constitution followed the model of the Constitution of the United States, and established Cundinamarca as a constitutional monarchy under (absent) Ferdinand VII (it would only declare full independence from Spain in August 1813). The Cundinamarca state also attempted to impose its political model by way of a strategy that involved annexing neighboring regions and towns, while attempting to create alliances with Venezuela in order to balance out the power of the big provinces, such as Cartagena and Popayán. During this period, Antonio Nariño became an ardent critic of federalist ideas and the key promoter of the idea of a strong republican government centered in Santafé. Nariño created a newspaper, La Bagatela, on July 14, 1811, which became the main outlet of his views against the adoption of federalism for New Granada. Nariño became president of Cundinamarca on September, 1811, vouching for a centralized republic. Following a failed royalist coup d'état, Cartagena became the first province in New Granada to formally declare its independence from Spain on November 11, 1811 (the day is also today a national holiday in Colombia). The \\"Congress of the United Provinces,\\" meanwhile, started meeting again. Despite Cundinamarca's opposition, the Congress finally achieved an agreement and delivered the Act of Federation of the United Provinces of New Granada on November 27, 1811, which was written by Camilo Torres and signed by the deputies of five provinces. The Act established a confederation of equal and independent, sovereign states called the United Provinces of New Granada. Each state would have a representational government elected by its own people, and would exert the legislative and executive powers with full responsibility falling on internal administration. The Act also provided some power to the General Congress, which had as its function the issues of common defense, international affairs, and war and peace. An extremely weak president position was created, who would be subordinate to the congress. The establishment of the judicial power was delayed until the risk of war had disappeared. The act, however, failed to integrate New Granada as a whole entity, particularly due to the energetic opposition of Cundinamarca, and only made the differences between centralist and federalist ideas even stronger. Nariño and his followers became ardent opponents to federalism and to the congress, and were convinced that the economic and political power of Cundinamarca would allow it to dominate and unify New Granada. Nariño convened an assembly to revise the constitution of the state and make it even more centralist, and then decided to annex the surrounding provinces of Tunja, Socorro, Pamplona, Mariquita, and Neiva, but was mostly unsuccessful on both enterprises. Nevertheless, the members of the Congress had to leave Bogotá as a result of the harassment, and later relocated to Leyva and finally to Tunja. Cartagena had by then become the main rival for the centralist ideas. The animosity between Nariño's federalist factions and the centralist factions in the Congress, led by Torres, soon spread to the respective regions. The Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca and the United Provinces of New Granada (the Congress now located in the province of Tunja) engaged in constant conflict, and soon became embroiled in Civil War. Nariño ordered General Antonio Baraya to defeat the federalist leaders in Tunja, but Baraya decided to switch sides and support the federalist forces, and many important leaders like Santander and Caldas joined him. Baraya and the rebels with him signed an act that declared Nariño an usurper and a tyrant, and pledged loyalty to the Congress. Nariño used the opportunity to request extraordinary powers from the legislature of Cundinamarca, which allowed him to be appointed as a dictator. On November 26, 1812, Nariño left with his army to conquer Tunja. On December 2, 1812, his army faced a federalist army commanded by Antonio Ricaurte and Atanasio Girardot in the Battle of Ventaquemada, and was soundly defeated, having to retreat back to Bogota. The federalist troops, however, only started pursuing more than a week later, giving Nariño's troops enough chance to plan a defense. Santafé was sieged by Baraya's troops on December 24. On January 9, 1813, in the Battle of San Victorino, Nariño's troops proved superior and the federalist armies were completely defeated. The first civil war hence resulted in a sort of stalemate, which nevertheless allowed Cundinamarca to organize an expedition against the royalist regions of Popayán and Pasto, and Quito in July, 1813. Nariño assembled his 'Army of the South,' numbering 1500 to 2000 men, and managed to capture Popayán in January 1814, but was then defeated by the Royalist forces in Pasto, after which he was arrested in May 1814, and then sent to the Royal prison at Cádiz. The failure of the campaign and the capture of Nariño left an enfeebled Cundinamarca, so the United Provinces took the opportunity to send an army against it, headed by Simón Bolívar, who had fled Venezuela for the second time after the fall of the Second Republic of Venezuela. Bolívar and his army forced the submission of Cundinamarca to the United Provinces by December 1814. Meanwhile, Cartagena had been engaged in war against the then-Royalist city of Santa Marta, and was in chaos following its defeat. == Aftermath: Spanish reconquest of New Granada == Impoverished by the civil wars between federalist and centralist factions, as well as the squirmishes and wars against Royalist cities, the provinces were in a precarious position already by the end of 1814. This added to the fact that many in the recently independent provinces had never rejected the legitimacy of Ferdinand VII as sovereign king, and that despite the independence movement, the political and cultural life in the provinces was largely unchanged and still under the powerful influence of Spain. In addition, the Catholic church had mostly opposed independence. By mid-1815 a large Spanish expeditionary force under Pablo Morillo had arrived in New Granada, which bolstered earlier royalist advances made by Santa Marta. Morillo laid siege on Cartagena on August and it finally fell five months later in December with the city suffering large numbers of civilian casualties due to famine and disease. By May 6, 1816, Morillo and royalists from the south had conquered Bogotá, and hence returned all of New Granada to royalist control, which lasted until August 1819, when forces under the command of Simón Bolívar retook the central part of the region. == See also == *Spanish American wars of independence *History of Colombia *Viceroyalty of New Granada *United Provinces of New Granada *Gran Colombia *Antonio Nariño *Spanish reconquest of New Granada *Bolívar's campaign to liberate New Granada ==References== ==Bibliography== * Blossom, Thomas.

Normally, commissioners are volunteers. In some Scout associations, the term Executive Commissioner is used to refer to a paid staff member. ==History== The commissioner role appeared early in the Scouting movement. Individual troops were organized by existing community organizations, and those organizations took the primary responsibility for implementing the Scouting program. To ensure consistency between different troops, the Scouting movement relied on two concepts: leader training and the commissioner staff. Scouting's founder, Baden-Powell, developed and promoted numerous leader training programs, starting in 1910 and leading to a course in 1919 that is now known as Wood Badge. The commissioner staff provided an ongoing, independent check on the troops themselves. ==Title== A commissioner's full title is derived from their level within the organization: * Unit Commissioner * Area Commissioner * Camp Commissioner * District Commissioner * Council Commissioner * Regional Commissioner * Provincial Commissioner * National Commissioner * Chief Commissioner Sometimes commissioners have responsibility for a specific topic, such as Commissioner for Camping, District Roundtable Commissioner, or Deputy Commissioner for Wolf Cubs. Some commissioners also have assistants, such as the Assistant District Commissioner. ==Boy Scouts of America== Commissioner Service is the group within the Boy Scouts of America that provides direct service to each Scouting unit (pack, troop, team, crew or ship). Commissioners are experienced Scouters who help chartered organizations and unit leaders to achieve the aims of Scouting by using the methods of Scouting. They help to ensure that each unit has strong leadership and they encourage training, promote the use of the unit committee and encourage a relationship with the chartering organization. The Commissioner position is the oldest in Scouting and is the origin of the professional Scouter positions. ==References== Category:People associated with Scouting ","title":"Scout Commissioner"},{"id":"3229900","text":"The United Arab Emirates competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. ==Results by event== ===Athletics=== Men's 200m *Ali K.

Due to his pro- active approach, Number of complaints the office of Lokayukta was receiving dramatically increased from 20–25 per day to 200–250 per day while Venkatachala was in tenure. He personally led hundreds of raids often lashing out at corruption in political life. In his four and a half years in office, he had looked into more than 50,000 cases of misconduct and complaints from members of the public. While purists questioned his model of raiding government officials without notices, he was lauded in equal measure for acting as a deterrent towards corruption. He even drew lot of criticism often from politicians who accused him of tarnishing all politicians with the same brush. He was discontinued as Lokayukta for the second term because of legal hurdles although a huge campaign was done in favor of him. Owing to his popularity he was featured in a Kannada film Lancha Samrajya as an officer fighting the corruption. ==Footnotes== ==External links== * Karnataka Lokayukta Category:1930 births Category:2019 deaths Category:20th-century Indian judges Category:Chief Justices of the Karnataka High Court Category:Judges of the Karnataka High Court Category:Justices of the Supreme Court of India Category:Lokayuktas Category:People from Kolar district Category:University Law College, Bangalore University alumni Category:University of Mysore alumni ","title":"N.

Often used while drilling oil and natural gas wells and on exploration drilling rigs, drilling fluids are also used for much simpler boreholes, such as water wells. One of the functions of drilling mud is to carry cuttings out of the hole. The three main categories of drilling fluids are: water-based muds (WBs), which can be dispersed and non-dispersed; non-aqueous muds, usually called oil-based muds (OBs); and gaseous drilling fluid, in which a wide range of gases can be used. Along with their formatives, these are used along with appropriate polymer and clay additives for drilling various oil and gas formations. The main functions of drilling fluids include providing hydrostatic pressure to prevent formation fluids from entering into the well bore, keeping the drill bit cool and clean during drilling, carrying out drill cuttings, and suspending the drill cuttings while drilling is paused and when the drilling assembly is brought in and out of the hole. The drilling fluid used for a particular job is selected to avoid formation damage and to limit corrosion. ==Types== Source: Many types of drilling fluids are used on a day-to-day basis. Some wells require different types to be used at different parts in the hole, or for some types to be used in combination with others. The various types of fluid generally fall into a few broad categories:Oilfield Glossary * Air: Compressed air is pumped either down the bore hole's annular space or down the drill string itself. * Air/water: The same as above, with water added to increase viscosity, flush the hole, provide more cooling, and/or to control dust. * Air/polymer: A specially formulated chemical, most often referred to as a type of polymer, is added to the water and air mixture to create specific conditions. A foaming agent is a good example of a polymer. * Water: Water by itself is sometimes used. In offshore drilling, seawater is typically used while drilling the top section of the hole. * Water-based mud (WBM): Most basic water-based mud systems begin with water, then clays and other chemicals are incorporated into the water to create a homogeneous blend resembling something between chocolate milk and a malt (depending on viscosity). The clay is usually a combination of native clays that are suspended in the fluid while drilling, or specific types of clay that are processed and sold as additives for the WBM system. The most common of these is bentonite, frequently referred to in the oilfield as \\"gel.\\" Gel likely makes reference to the fact that while the fluid is being pumped, it can be very thin and free-flowing (like chocolate milk), though when pumping is stopped, the static fluid builds a \\"gel\\" structure that resists flow. When an adequate pumping force is applied to \\"break the gel,\\" flow resumes and the fluid returns to its previously free- flowing state. Many other chemicals (e.g. potassium formate) are added to a WBM system to achieve various effects, including: viscosity control, shale stability, enhance drilling rate of penetration, and cooling and lubricating of equipment. * Oil-based mud (OBM): Oil-based mud is a mud where the base fluid is a petroleum product such as diesel fuel. Oil-based muds are used for many reasons, including increased lubricity, enhanced shale inhibition, and greater cleaning abilities with less viscosity. Oil-based muds also withstand greater heat without breaking down. The use of oil-based muds has special considerations, including cost, environmental considerations such as disposal of cuttings in an appropriate place, and the exploratory disadvantages of using oil-based mud, especially in wildcat wells. Using an oil-based mud interferes with the geochemical analysis of cuttings and cores and with the determination of API gravity because the base fluid cannot be distinguished from oil that is returned from the formation. * Synthetic-based fluid (SBM) (Otherwise known as Low Toxicity Oil Based Mud or LTOBM): Synthetic-based fluid is a mud in which the base fluid is a synthetic oil. This is most often used on offshore rigs because it has the properties of an oil-based mud, but the toxicity of the fluid fumes are much less than an oil-based fluid. This is important when the drilling crew works with the fluid in an enclosed space such as an offshore drilling rig. Synthetic-based fluid poses the same environmental and analysis problems as oil-based fluid. On a drilling rig, mud is pumped from the mud pits through the drill string, where it sprays out of nozzles on the drill bit, thus cleaning and cooling the drill bit in the process. The mud then carries the crushed or cut rock (\\"cuttings\\") up the annular space (\\"annulus\\") between the drill string and the sides of the hole being drilled, up through the surface casing, where it emerges back at the surface. Cuttings are then filtered out with either a shale shaker or the newer shale conveyor technology, and the mud returns to the mud pits. The mud pits let the drilled \\"fines\\" settle; the pits are also where the fluid is treated by adding chemicals and other substances. Fluid Pit The returning mud can contain natural gases or other flammable materials which will collect in and around the shale shaker / conveyor area or in other work areas. Because of the risk of a fire or an explosion if they ignite, special monitoring sensors and explosion-proof certified equipment is commonly installed, and workers are trained in safety precautions. The mud is then pumped back down the hole and further re-circulated. After testing, the mud is treated periodically in the mud pits to ensure there are the desired properties that optimize and improve drilling efficiency, borehole stability, and other requirements, as listed below. ==Function== The main functions of a drilling mud can be summarized as follows: ===Remove cuttings from well=== Mud Pit Drilling fluid carries the rock excavated by the drill bit up to the surface. Its ability to do so depends on cutting size, shape, and density, and speed of fluid traveling up the well (annular velocity). These considerations are analogous to the ability of a stream to carry sediment; large sand grains in a slow-moving stream settle to the stream bed, while small sand grains in a fast-moving stream are carried along with the water. The mud viscosity is another important property, as cuttings will settle to the bottom of the well if the viscosity is too low. Fly Ash Absorbent for Fluids in Mud Pits Other properties include: * Most drilling muds are thixotropic (viscosity increase during static conditions). This characteristic keeps the cuttings suspended when the mud is not flowing during, for example, maintenance. * Fluids that have shear thinning and elevated viscosities are efficient for hole cleaning. * Higher annular velocity improves cutting transport. Transport ratio (transport velocity / lowest annular velocity) should be at least 50%. * High density fluids may clean holes adequately even with lower annular velocities (by increasing the buoyancy force acting on cuttings). But may have a negative impact if mud weight is in excess of that needed to balance the pressure of surrounding rock (formation pressure), so mud weight is not usually increased for hole cleaning purposes. * Higher rotary drill-string speeds introduce a circular component to annular flow path. This helical flow around the drill-string causes drill cuttings near the wall, where poor hole cleaning conditions occur, to move into higher transport regions of the annulus. Increased rotation is the one of the best methods for increasing hole cleaning in high angle and horizontal wells. ===Suspend and release cuttings=== Source: * Must suspend drill cuttings, weight materials and additives under a wide range of conditions. * Drill cuttings that settle can causes bridges and fill, which can cause stuck- pipe and lost circulation. * Weight material that settles is referred to as sag, this causes a wide variation in the density of well fluid, this more frequently occurs in high angle and hot wells. * High concentrations of drill solids are detrimental to: ** Drilling efficiency (it causes increased mud weight and viscosity, which in turn increases maintenance costs and increased dilution) ** Rate of Penetration (ROP) (increases horsepower required to circulate) ** Mud properties that are suspended must be balanced with properties in cutting removal by solids control equipment * For effective solids controls, drill solids must be removed from mud on the 1st circulation from the well. If re-circulated, cuttings break into smaller pieces and are more difficult to remove. * Conduct a test to compare the sand content of mud at flow line and suction pit (to determine whether cuttings are being removed). ===Control formation pressures=== Source: * If formation pressure increases, mud density should also be increased to balance pressure and keep the wellbore stable. The most common weighting material is barite. Unbalanced formation pressures will cause an unexpected influx (also known as a kick) of formation fluids in the wellbore possibly leading to a blowout from pressured formation fluids. * Hydrostatic pressure = density of drilling fluid * true vertical depth * acceleration of gravity. If hydrostatic pressure is greater than or equal to formation pressure, formation fluid will not flow into the wellbore. * Well control means no uncontrollable flow of formation fluids into the wellbore. * Hydrostatic pressure also controls the stresses caused by tectonic forces, these may make wellbores unstable even when formation fluid pressure is balanced. * If formation pressure is subnormal, air, gas, mist, stiff foam, or low density mud (oil base) can be used. * In practice, mud density should be limited to the minimum necessary for well control and wellbore stability. If too great it may fracture the formation. ===Seal permeable formations === Source: * Mud column pressure must exceed formation pressure, in this condition mud filtrate invades the formation, and a filter cake of mud is deposited on the wellbore wall. * Mud is designed to deposit thin, low permeability filter cake to limit the invasion. * Problems occur if a thick filter cake is formed; tight hole conditions, poor log quality, stuck pipe, lost circulation and formation damage. * In highly permeable formations with large bore throats, whole mud may invade the formation, depending on mud solids size; ** Use bridging agents to block large opening, then mud solids can form seal. ** For effectiveness, bridging agents must be over the half size of pore spaces / fractures. ** Bridging agents (e.g. calcium carbonate, ground cellulose). * Depending on the mud system in use, a number of additives can improve the filter cake (e.g. bentonite, natural & synthetic polymer, asphalt and gilsonite). ===Maintain wellbore stability=== Source: * Chemical composition and mud properties must combine to provide a stable wellbore. Weight of the mud must be within the necessary range to balance the mechanical forces. * Wellbore instability = sloughing formations, which can cause tight hole conditions, bridges and fill on trips (same symptoms indicate hole cleaning problems). * Wellbore stability = hole maintains size and cylindrical shape. * If the hole is enlarged, it becomes weak and difficult to stabilize, resulting in problems such as low annular velocities, poor hole cleaning, solids loading and poor formation evaluation * In sand and sandstones formations, hole enlargement can be accomplished by mechanical actions (hydraulic forces & nozzles velocities). Formation damage is reduced by conservative hydraulics system. A good quality filter cake containing bentonite is known to limit bore hole enlargement. * In shales, mud weight is usually sufficient to balance formation stress, as these wells are usually stable. With water base mud, chemical differences can cause interactions between mud & shale that lead to softening of the native rock. Highly fractured, dry, brittle shales can be extremely unstable (leading to mechanical problems). * Various chemical inhibitors can control mud / shale interactions (calcium, potassium, salt, polymers, asphalt, glycols and oil – best for water sensitive formations) * Oil (and synthetic oil) based drilling fluids are used to drill most water sensitive Shales in areas with difficult drilling conditions. * To add inhibition, emulsified brine phase (calcium chloride) drilling fluids are used to reduce water activity and creates osmotic forces to prevent adsorption of water by Shales. ===Minimizing formation damage=== Source: * Skin damage or any reduction in natural formation porosity and permeability (washout) constitutes formation damage *skin damage is the accumulation of residuals on the perforations and that causes a pressure drop through them. * Most common damage; ** Mud or drill solids invade the formation matrix, reducing porosity and causing skin effect ** Swelling of formation clays within the reservoir, reduced permeability ** Precipitation of solids due to mixing of mud filtrate and formations fluids resulting in the precipitation of insoluble salts ** Mud filtrate and formation fluids form an emulsion, reducing reservoir porosity * Specially designed drill-in fluids or workover and completion fluids, minimize formation damage. ===Cool, lubricate, and support the bit and drilling assembly=== Source: * Heat is generated from mechanical and hydraulic forces at the bit and when the drill string rotates and rubs against casing and wellbore. * Cool and transfer heat away from source and lower to temperature than bottom hole. * If not, the bit, drill string and mud motors would fail more rapidly. * Lubrication based on the coefficient of friction.(\\"Coefficient of friction\\" is how much friction on side of wellbore and collar size or drill pipe size to pull stuck pipe) Oil- and synthetic-based mud generally lubricate better than water-based mud (but the latter can be improved by the addition of lubricants). * Amount of lubrication provided by drilling fluid depends on type & quantity of drill solids and weight materials + chemical composition of system. * Poor lubrication causes high torque and drag, heat checking of the drill string, but these problems are also caused by key seating, poor hole cleaning and incorrect bottom hole assemblies design. * Drilling fluids also support portion of drill-string or casing through buoyancy. Suspend in drilling fluid, buoyed by force equal to weight (or density) of mud, so reducing hook load at derrick. * Weight that derrick can support limited by mechanical capacity, increase depth so weight of drill-string and casing increase. * When running long, heavy string or casing, buoyancy possible to run casing strings whose weight exceed a rig's hook load capacity. ===Transmit hydraulic energy to tools and bit=== Source: * Hydraulic energy provides power to mud motor for bit rotation and for MWD (measurement while drilling) and LWD (logging while drilling) tools. Hydraulic programs base on bit nozzles sizing for available mud pump horsepower to optimize jet impact at bottom well. * Limited to: ** Pump horsepower ** Pressure loss inside drillstring ** Maximum allowable surface pressure ** Optimum flow rate ** Drill string pressure loses higher in fluids of higher densities, plastic viscosities and solids. * Low solids, shear thinning drilling fluids such as polymer fluids, more efficient in transmit hydraulic energy. * Depth can be extended by controlling mud properties. * Transfer information from MWD & LWD to surface by pressure pulse. ===Ensure adequate formation evaluation=== Source: * Chemical and physical mud properties as well as wellbore conditions after drilling affect formation evaluation. * Mud loggers examine cuttings for mineral composition, visual sign of hydrocarbons and recorded mud logs of lithology, ROP, gas detection or geological parameters. * Wireline logging measure – electrical, sonic, nuclear and magnetic resonance. * Potential productive zone are isolated and performed formation testing and drill stem testing. * Mud helps not to disperse of cuttings and also improve cutting transport for mud loggers determine the depth of the cuttings originated. * Oil-based mud, lubricants, asphalts will mask hydrocarbon indications. * So mud for drilling core selected base on type of evaluation to be performed (many coring operations specify a bland mud with minimum of additives). ===Control corrosion (in acceptable level)=== Source: * Drill-string and casing in continuous contact with drilling fluid may cause a form of corrosion. * Dissolved gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide) cause serious corrosion problems; ** Cause rapid, catastrophic failure ** May be deadly to humans after a short period of time * Low pH (acidic) aggravates corrosion, so use corrosion coupons to monitor corrosion type, rates and to tell correct chemical inhibitor is used in correct amount. * Mud aeration, foaming and other O2 trapped conditions cause corrosion damage in short period time. * When drilling in high H2S, elevated the pH fluids + sulfide scavenging chemical (zinc). ===Facilitate cementing and completion=== Source: * Cementing is critical to effective zone and well completion. * During casing run, mud must remain fluid and minimize pressure surges so fracture induced lost circulation does not occur. * Temperature of water used for cement must be within tolerance of cementers performing task, usually 70 degrees, most notably in winter conditions. * Mud should have thin, slick filter cake, with minimal solids in filter cake, wellbore with minimal cuttings, caving or bridges will prevent a good casing run to bottom. Circulate well bore until clean. * To cement and completion operation properly, mud displace by flushes and cement. For effectiveness; ** Hole near gauges, use proper hole cleaning techniques, pumping sweeps at TD, and perform wiper trip to shoe. ** Mud low viscosity, mud parameters should be tolerant of formations being drilled, and drilling fluid composition, turbulent flow - low viscosity high pump rate, laminar flow - high viscosity, high pump rate. ** Mud non progressive gel strength ===Minimize impact on environment=== Unlined drilling fluid sumps were commonplace before the environmental consequences were recognized. Source: Mud is, in varying degrees, toxic. It is also difficult and expensive to dispose of it in an environmentally friendly manner. A Vanity Fair article described the conditions at Lago Agrio, a large oil field in Ecuador where drillers were effectively unregulated. Water based drilling fluid has very little toxicity, made from water, bentonite and barite, all clay from mining operations, usually found in Wyoming and in Lunde, Telemark. There are specific chemicals that can be used in water based drilling fluids that alone can be corrosive and toxic, such as hydrochloric acid. However, when mixed into water based drilling fluids, hydrochloric acid only decreases the pH of the water to a more manageable level. Caustic (sodium hydroxide), anhydrous lime, soda ash, bentonite, barite and polymers are the most common chemicals used in water based drilling fluids. Oil Base Mud and synthetic drilling fluids can contain high levels of benzene, and other chemicals Most common chemicals added to OBM Muds: * Barite * Bentonite * Diesel * Emulsifiers * Water ==Composition of drilling mud== Source: Water-based drilling mud most commonly consists of bentonite clay (gel) with additives such as barium sulfate (barite), calcium carbonate (chalk) or hematite. Various thickeners are used to influence the viscosity of the fluid, e.g. xanthan gum, guar gum, glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, polyanionic cellulose (PAC), or starch. In turn, deflocculants are used to reduce viscosity of clay-based muds; anionic polyelectrolytes (e.g. acrylates, polyphosphates, lignosulfonates (Lig) or tannic acid derivates such as Quebracho) are frequently used. Red mud was the name for a Quebracho-based mixture, named after the color of the red tannic acid salts; it was commonly used in the 1940s to 1950s, then was made obsolete when lignosulfonates became available. Other components are added to provide various specific functional characteristics as listed above. Some other common additives include lubricants, shale inhibitors, fluid loss additives (to control loss of drilling fluids into permeable formations). A weighting agent such as barite is added to increase the overall density of the drilling fluid so that sufficient bottom hole pressure can be maintained thereby preventing an unwanted (and often dangerous) influx of formation fluids. Also, use of silica and clay nanoparticles for high pressure high temperature (HPHT) invert emulsion based muds, and observed their positive effect on the rheology of the drilling mud. ==Factors influencing drilling fluid performance== Some factors affecting drilling fluid performance are: *Fluid Rheology *The change of drilling fluid viscosity * The change of drilling fluid density * The change of mud pH * Corrosion or fatigue of the drill string * Thermal stability of the drilling fluid * Differential sticking ==Drilling mud classification== They are classified based on their fluid phase, alkalinity, dispersion and the type of chemicals used. ===Dispersed systems=== * Freshwater mud: Low pH mud (7.0–9.5) that includes spud, bentonite, natural, phosphate treated muds, organic mud and organic colloid treated mud. high pH mud example alkaline tannate treated muds are above 9.5 in pH. * Water based drilling mud that represses hydration and dispersion of clay – There are 4 types: high pH lime muds, low pH gypsum, seawater and saturated salt water muds. ===Non-dispersed systems=== * Low solids mud: These muds contain less than 3–6% solids by volume and weight less than 9.5 lbs/gal. Most muds of this type are water- based with varying quantities of bentonite and a polymer. * Emulsions: The two types used are oil in water (oil emulsion muds) and water in oil (invert oil emulsion muds). **Oil based mud: Oil based muds contain oil as the continuous phase and water as a contaminant, and not an element in the design of the mud. They typically contain less than 5% (by volume) water. Oil-based muds are usually a mixture of diesel fuel and asphalt, however can be based on produced crude oil and mud ==Mud engineer== Mud pit with fly ash \\"Mud engineer\\" is the name given to an oil field service company individual who is charged with maintaining a drilling fluid or completion fluid system on an oil and/or gas drilling rig. This individual typically works for the company selling the chemicals for the job and is specifically trained with those products, though independent mud engineers are still common. The role of the mud engineer, or more properly drilling fluids engineer, is very critical to the entire drilling operation because even small problems with mud can stop the whole operations on rig. The internationally accepted shift pattern at off-shore drilling operations is personnel (including mud engineers) work on a 28-day shift pattern, where they work for 28 continuous days and rest the following 28 days. In Europe this is more commonly a 21-day shift pattern. In offshore drilling, with new technology and high total day costs, wells are being drilled extremely fast. Having two mud engineers makes economic sense to prevent down time due to drilling fluid difficulties. Two mud engineers also reduce insurance costs to oil companies for environmental damage that oil companies are responsible for during drilling and production. A senior mud engineer typically works in the day, and a junior mud engineer at night. The cost of the drilling fluid is typically about 10% (may vary greatly) of the total cost of drilling a well, and demands competent mud engineers. Large cost savings result when the mud engineer and fluid performs adequately. The mud engineer is not to be confused with mudloggers, service personnel who monitor gas from the mud and collect well bore samples. ==Compliance engineer== The compliance engineer is the most common name for a relatively new position in the oil field, emerging around 2002 due to new environmental regulations on synthetic mud in the United States. Previously, synthetic mud was regulated the same as water-based mud and could be disposed of in offshore waters due to low toxicity to marine organisms. New regulations restrict the amount of synthetic oil that can be discharged. These new regulations created a significant burden in the form of tests needed to determine the \\"ROC\\" or retention on cuttings, sampling to determine the percentage of crude oil in the drilling mud, and extensive documentation. No type of oil/synthetic based mud (or drilled cuttings contaminated with OBM/SBM) may be dumped in the North Sea. Contaminated mud must either be shipped back to shore in skips or processed on the rigs. A new monthly toxicity test is also now performed to determine sediment toxicity, using the amphipod Leptocheirus plumulosus. Various concentrations of the drilling mud are added to the environment of captive L. plumulosus to determine its effect on the animals. The test is controversial for two reasons: # These animals are not native to many of the areas regulated by them, including the Gulf of Mexico # The test has a very large standard deviation, and samples that fail badly may pass easily upon retesting ==See also== * Directional drilling * Driller (oil) * Drilling fluid decanter centrifuge * Drilling rig * Formation evaluation * Landfarming * Mud Gas Separator * Mud systems * MWD (measurement while drilling) * Oil well control * Roughneck * Underbalanced drilling ==References== ==Further reading== * ASME Shale Shaker Committee (2005).

It is the capital of the Powiat of Myślibórz (powiat myśliborski), with a population of 11,867. It is home to the first monastery of the Congregation of Sisters of Merciful Jesus and a sanctuary of the Divine Mercy.The Congregation of the Sisters of Merciful Jesus ==History== ===Middle Ages=== Timber-framed monastery The city's official webpage mentions a settlement inhabited by a pre-Slavic population from Lusatian culture on the shores of the lake (Polish: Jezioro Myśliborskie; German: Soldiner See) in the 7th century, which later turned into a West Slavic or Lechitic fortress in the 10th and 11th centuries; the area was incorporated into Poland by the Piast duke Mieszko I by the end of the 10th century. According to the city's webpage, the town site was a fishing settlement called Sołtyń, located on trading route between Silesia and Greater Poland towards Oder delta. It is from this fishing settlement that the later German name of the town comes: Soldin. The site was acquired as a rest house by the Dominican Order in 1234, while the fort was granted to the Knights Templar by Duke Władysław Odonic and finally sold to the Ascanian margraves Johann I and Otto III of Brandenburg in 1261. Together with the nearby castellany of Santok, the former Greater Polish lands were incorporated into the Brandenburgian Neumark (\\"New March\\"; ) territory. The town was first mentioned as Soldin in a 1270 deed and quickly became the administrative centre of the region, a Dominican monastery was founded there in 1275. However, in the first half of the 14th century Soldin declined due to famine and political strife of the Ascanian dynasty, in the course of which the Soldin Castle was destroyed. In 1373 the New March became part of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (or Czech Lands), ruled by the Luxembourg dynasty. In 1402, the Luxembourgs reached an agreement with Poland in Kraków. Poland was to buy and re-incorporate the region, but eventually the Luxembourgs sold it to the Teutonic Order. During the Polish–Teutonic War, in 1433 the town was destroyed by the Hussites. In 1455 the Teutonic Knights sold the town to the Margraviate of Brandenburg, now under the rule of the House of Hohenzollern, in order to raise funds for another war with Poland. Elector Frederick Irontooth had Brandenburg's suzerainty over the area formalized in the 1466 Treaty of Soldin with the Pomeranian dukes (see below). In 1473 the town was briefly captured by Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania. ===Modern era=== Myśliborskie Lake In the 16th century, Margrave Johann of Brandenburg-Küstrin converted the Neumark to Protestantism, seceded from Brandenburg and transferred his court from Soldin to Küstrin (now Kostrzyn nad Odrą, Poland). The Dominican monastery was dissolved. Soldin suffered heavy damage in the Thirty Years War, when it was overrun by the Imperial army under Albrecht von Wallenstein marching against King Christian IV of Denmark. It began to recover only in the 18th century as a garrison town of the Kingdom of Prussia under Frederick the Great. When the German Empire was formed in 1871, Soldin was the capital of a rural district (Landkreis) within the Prussian Province of Brandenburg. In the 19th century, Soldin was largely bypassed by the industrial revolution, and was not served by rail until 1888. Electrification came in 1898, and a municipal water system only in 1912. In the nearby forest, the Lituanica plane crash occurred on 17 July 1933. By the beginning of the Second World War in 1939, Soldin had 6,284 inhabitants. The city was captured without a fight by the Red Army on 31 January 1945. After a Soviet soldier attempting to rape a local woman was shot and killed by her husband on 3 February, the Soviets rounded up 160 civilians from the town, mostly teenaged boys and elderly men, and murdered 120 of them in a nearby quarry four days later. After the discovery of the mass grave of the victims in 1995, a memorial commemorating the victims was erected.http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/sowjet-greuel-soldiner- geiselmord_aid_153238.html With the end of the war in 1945, the partly depopulated area was transferred to Poland under border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference. The surviving German population of Soldin was forcibly expelled and the town, renamed Myślibórz, was gradually repopulated by Polish settlers. It was a powiat centre initially in Szczecin Voivodeship (1945-1975), then in Gorzów one (1975-1998), finally in West Pomeranian one since 31 December 1998. Historically, the town was the site of two important treaties: The Treaty of Soldin (1309) between the Margraviate of Brandenburg and the Teutonic Order State, and the Treaty of Soldin (1466) between the Electorate of Brandenburg and the Duchy of Pomerania. ==Notable residents== * Friedrich Wilhelm von Dossow (1669-1758), Prussian field marshal * August Piepenhagen (1791–1868) a German landscape painter * Daniel Lessmann (1794–1831), German-Jewish historian and poet. * Hermann Kennemann (1815–1910) a Prussian politician and landowner, co-founder of the German Eastern Marches Society * Anna Schepeler-Lette (1829–1897) a German politician, feminist and women's social reformer. * Heino Schmieden (1835–1913) a German architect * Max Fesca (1846–1917) a German specialist in agricultural science and agronomy * William C.

Briefly Ambassador to the Netherlands between February and May 1815, it was during his posting as Ambassador in Spain that he became indispensable to the Duke of Wellington. At the Generals' insistence, he was appointed British Ambassador to France. During Napoleon's Hundred Days, he left Paris and was in Brussels at the start of the Waterloo Campaign, where during his stay he attended the Duchess of Richmond's Ball. After the fall of Napoleon, he escorted the exiled French King Louis XVIII back to Paris, and became British Ambassador there until 1824. In 1815 he was made a Knight-Grand-Cross in the civil division of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath (GCB). From 1825 to 1826 he was once more Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Portugal and Brazil. In 1825 the Portuguese King John VI named Stuart his plenipotentiary with powers to negotiate and sign with Brazil a Treaty on the recognition of that country's independence. Invested with those powers, Stuart signed the treaty recognising Brazilian independence on 29 August 1825, and on 15 November of the same year the Portuguese King ratified the treaty.

Charlotte Stuart (1817-1861), wife of Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning. *Hon. Louisa Anne Stuart (1818-1891), wife of Henry Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford. ===Highcliffe Castle=== Early retirement from the diplomatic service meant he start on a project to build a new family home. By 1830 he had purchased much of the eastern end of the estate, at Highcliffe, Dorset. Previously had been owned by his forebears, the estate had been sold by his father. He engaged William Donthorne, a founder member of the Royal Institute of British Architects, to design a new Highcliffe Castle. The castle is built on an L shaped plan, oriented on a south-east axis, so the oriel window is central on the south east elevation, providing a vista across the landscaped gardens to a panorama of the needles and Isle of Wight. Used in the building of the house was carved medieval stonework from the Norman Benedictine Abbey of St Peter at Jumieges and from the Grande Maison des Les Andelys. Both of these buildings had fallen into disrepair after the French Revolution. Also included in the castle, were a 16th-century oriel window and a stained glass window.

The line then branched from the old Central Pacific grade and went southeast for about 2 miles to the Eagle Salt Works. The railroad was incorporated on February 16, 1903. The track was built over the original Central Pacific transcontintinental railway grade that had been abandoned as the CP relocated its mainline in 1903. Salt demand from the works was already in decline when the railroad opened in 1903. The first train to carry salt did not operate until March 1906. From 1906-1910 railroad had very little activity on the line. In 1910, the Southern Pacific Company (SP), which loaned $23,535 to Leete for the railroad, acquired Leete's railroad and salt works due to Leete's default on the loan. Under the Southern Pacific the railroad continued to see little traffic on the line, consisting of salt, coal and hay. The SP abandoned the railroad in March 1916 and the track was removed in April. ==Eagle Salt Works== The Eagle Salt Works Railroad was built to haul salt to the Nevada silver mills. B.F. Leete, a surveyor on the Central Pacific Railroad, discovered the hot springs 15 miles east of Wadsworth up the Hot Springs grade in 1869. He recognized that salt was a needed mineral in the reduction of Comstock Lode silver ore, which was in high demand at that time. The hot springs contained 30% salt and when evaporated provided salt crystals ready for harvest and ready for shipment. In 1871, Leete's Eagle Salt Works began furnishing salt to the Nevada silver mills. In his first year, he furnished about 3,000 tons of salt. The salt production peaked between 1879-1884. Leete shipped the salt via the Central Pacific Railroad as the CP operated near his Salt Works. However, in 1903 the Central Pacific relocated its mainline between Wadsworth - Toy (near milepost 325; east of Lovelock, NV) in favor of a route to the south that goes through Fernley and Hazen to avoid the grade over White Plains Hill. . This relocation would leave Leete without a railroad to ship his salt. In August 1902, Leete negotiated with the Central Pacific that when they relocated and removed the tracks, that they leave every other tie in place from Leete (Milepost 294.5) to just east of Wadsworth. Leete proposed to build a light railroad using the old CP grade to a connection with the CP at Wadsworth. ==Construction of the line== On February 16 1903 the Eagle Salt Works was created. Leete built about a mile of track from Luva north to Thisbe (old) at Central Pacific's Milepost 282.37. From Thisbe his railroad ran northeast to Leete along the original/abandoned route of the Central Pacific mainline. At Leete he built a branch off the old CP grade that went two miles to his salt works. In June 1903 the 14.5 mile line was completed. ==Locomotive== The Eagle Salt Works Railroad's engine #3 was a \\"Three Spot\\" coal-fired 0-4-0T locomotive that was built by Rhode Island Locomotive Works. The locomotive was formerly engine #1 on the Los Angeles Ostrich Farm Railway and its successor in 1887, the Los Angeles County Railroad. The locomotive was then sold to the Santa Ana and Newport Railway until 1903. In 1903 it was sold to Eagle Salt Works after being overhauled at the Central Pacific locomotive shops in Sacramento. In March 1903 it went to work on the Eagle Salt Works to assist in constructing the line. ==Connection with the Central Pacific Railroad== *Luva (2 miles east of Fernley, Nevada) ==Route== *Luva (near Fernley) *Thisbe *Desert *Leete *Eagle Salt Works ==Eagle Salt Works (locale)== Eagle Salt Works appears as a Churchill County, Nevada place and had a post office in 1871 and then again from 1877 - 1899.

Gachi- Changjo Publishing Company published a Korean translation entitled 6월 26일, 하멜른 (June 26, Hamelin) in 2007. Set in medieval Germany, the story is based on the legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. In this version, however, the Pied Piper is not an expert in magic piping, but an eighteen-year-old apprentice named Hannes (Johannes) who is supposed to kill the rats as his final exam before becoming a Master Piper.\\" Most folks think that fairy tales are just for kids,\\" Pittsburgh Post - Gazette. 1 November 2005.Poetic duo look beyond tale in The Rats of Hamelin (Beacon Edition,) Ebert, LisaAuthor Virginian - Pilot (Norfolk, Va,) 9 October 2005, Everything seems to go wrong. Someone is trying to keep the rats in Hamelin—someone with powers like Hannes’s. Hannes had hoped to buy his father’s freedom with the reward, but the Town Council has stolen every penny of the fund and is against Hannes from the beginning. Even the mayor’s daughter, with whom Hannes has fallen in love, seems to think he is getting in the way. In the end, Hannes has to overcome the Town Council, his mysterious enemy, and himself. ==History== The Rats of Hamelin is set mostly in the year 1284. At this time, Germany was the Holy Roman Empire, a group of dukedoms loosely united under an emperor. That is why there is talk of involving the Duke of Braunschweig (Brunswick) when a capital crime is committed. In the backstory of the novel is the Children's Crusade of 1212. This really took place, and the fictional character of the Old Woman of Aerzen is like many real parents who lost their children. The German cities of Hamelin, Aerzen, (Hessisch-)Oldendorf, and Koeln (Cologne) are real cities, although there may not have been manors with serfs near Aerzen and Oldendorf, and Koeln is not known to have housed a Piper's Guild. The Pied Piper himself seems to have some historical basis, and is thus a figure of history as well as legend. The Lueneberg Manuscript of 1450, which serves as an epigraph for the novel, sums up the little we know historically about him: \\"In the year 1284, on the days of John and Paul, the 26th of June, a piper clothed in various colors came and led away 130 children born in Hamelin to Calvary on the Koppen.\\" ==Fantasy== Hannes is trained in magical piping by the Piper's Guild. Like other medieval guilds, the Piper's Guild allows workers of one trade to help support one another. The difference is the pipers are no ordinary tradesmen. They use magic to promote justice and mercy wherever they go, and live on the rewards they sometimes receive for the help they give. Their magical flutes are similar to recorders in that they are played in front, rather than to the side, like a modern flute. The ends are flared, like the ends of trumpets, and there are no stops; everything is done with the fingers. The pipers use these magical flutes to enter the Pipeworld. Though the pipers never leave the real world (at least not in The Rats of Hamelin), access to the Pipeworld lets them operate in another dimension, layered on top of the world everyone else experiences. In the Pipeworld, pipers use their music and their minds to pull objects with invisible strings, transfer illness from others to themselves, freeze things, summon lightning, control animals, and cast terrible curses. They can also feel other people's souls in the Pipeworld; and if they understand someone's feelings well enough, they can enter that person's mind and experience the memories associated with those feelings. The state of a piper's own mind or soul is very important in the Pipeworld. Spells cast by a piper who has not resolved inner conflicts are vulnerable to attack and theft. In an address to middle-schoolers in Virginia Beach, Virginia, Adam McCune traced the inspiration of the Childrule curse (from the end of the book) to Isaiah 3:4 in the Bible. In the New International Version, the verse reads, \\"I will make boys their officials; mere children will govern them.\\" In addition to the curses that pipers cast, which have obvious effects and take place immediately, there is another kind of curse in The Rats of Hamelin: the one pronounced by the Old Woman of Aerzen. Though there is no reason to think that the Old Woman has magical powers, she nonetheless foretells a curse that eventually takes place. ==References== ==External links== *The Rats of Hamelin homepage *Adam McCune & Keith McCune (Moody Publishers author page) *Moody Publishers *June 26, Hamelin homepage *Gachi-Changjo (Shwimbook) *www.triune.de cites the Lueneberg manuscript which also serves as the epigraph of The Rats of Hamelin Category:2005 fantasy novels Category:American fantasy novels Category:American historical novels Category:American young adult novels Category:2005 American novels Category:Novels set in Germany Category:Fiction set in the 1280s Category:Moody Publishers books Category:Works based on Pied Piper of Hamelin Category:Novels based on fairy tales ","title":"The Rats of Hamelin"},{"id":"3230070","text":"Bellamy Bach was a group pseudonym used by several New York-based writers in the 1980s, some of whom still remain anonymous.

The production was completed in 2010 and premiered on BBC Two on 1 January 2011. It was watched by 6.65 million viewers. Since then, it has been repeated several times on Gold. ==Plotline== Several years before World War II, Ernie Wiseman, a precocious and confident child performer, is signed up by influential impresario Jack Hylton. In Morecambe, pushy stage mother, Sadie Bartholomew, drags her slightly reluctant son Eric, an eccentric dancer, from one audition to the next until he too is employed by Hylton. At first glance the boys do not initially get on but Sadie sees a way to use their cross-talk to form a bantering double act, originally known as Bartholomew and Wise. But as time goes on, Sadie comes to the conclusion that their name is stopping them from getting noticed, so after reading the local newspaper, The Morecambe Visitor, she suggests that they should change their name to Morecambe and Wise. After war service they become successful on stage and on radio but their attempt to crack the new medium of television is a disaster because they have been forced to accept a script which will make their Northernness acceptable to Southern viewers. As a result, the duo go their own ways and split up.

He is generally recognized (together with Martin Benka and Ľudovít Fulla) as one of key personalities in the beginning of Modern Slovak Art. ==Life== He studied at the Akademie Výtvarných Umění (Academy of Visual Arts) in Prague by Vlaho Bukovac, Maximilian Pirner and Max Švabinský. He lived in Liptovský Mikuláš, Martin and from 1937 in Bratislava. He began his creative artistic career with socially motivated expressive works from the environment of the urban periphery, as he called it. He developed genre painting in an original way, inspired by ballads, folk songs and legends (Hôrni chlapci – Mountain Robbers). He also devoted attention to stained glass and tapestries. Pastel was his most characteristic artistic technique. Alexy's decorative genre of pastels is prevalent throughout his rural pieces (Kúria Baanovcov v Trstenom – Curia of the Baans in Trstené). Alexy was especially adept at painting cityscapes, though peculiarly, for usually an air of abstract expressionism resided in the works. He also created several models for architectural projects, e.g. the window- pane at the P. O. Hviezdoslav Theatre in Bratislava. In his literary works J. Alexy preferred themes from the life of Slovak bohemia and autobiographical topics: Život nie je majáles (1956, Life is Not a May Festival), Osudy slovenských výtvarníkov (1948, Destinies of Slovak Graphic and Plastic Artists).

It is a composite film, juxtaposing documentary, fictional scenes and dramatised political readings. It is most notable for its scenes documenting the creative evolution of the song \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" as the Rolling Stones developed it during recording sessions at Olympic Studios in London. == Plot == Composing the film's main narrative thread are several long, uninterrupted shots of the Rolling Stones in London's Olympic Studios, recording and re-recording various parts to \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\". The dissolution of Stone Brian Jones is vividly portrayed, and the chaos of 1968 is made clear when a line referring to the killing of John F. Kennedy is heard changed to the plural after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in June. Interwoven through the movie are outdoor shots of Black Panthers milling about in a junkyard littered with rusting cars heaped upon each other. They read from revolutionary texts (including Amiri Baraka and Eldridge Cleaver) and toss their rifles to each other, from man to man. A group of white women, apparently kidnapped and dressed in white, are brutalized and ultimately shot, off-camera; their bloody bodies are subsequently seen in various tableaus throughout the film. The rest of the film contains a political message in the form of a voiceover about Marxism, the need for revolution and other topics in which Godard was interested. One scene involves a camera crew following a woman about, played by Anne Wiazemsky in a yellow peasant dress, in an outdoor wildlife setting; questions are asked of her, to which she always answers either \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\". As can be seen from the chapter heading to the scene, she is supposed to be a personification of democracy, a woman named 'Eve Democracy'. At least one quarter of the film is devoted to indoor shots of a pornographic bookstore that sells such diverse items as Marvel's Doctor Strange, DC's The Atom, and The Flash comic books, Nazi pamphlets for propaganda, and various men's magazines. Alternating with the shots of comic books, pinup magazines, and Nazi pamphlets, consumers casually enter the bookstore, approach a bookshelf, pick up books or magazines, exchange them for a sheet of paper, and then slap the faces of two Maoist hostages sitting patiently next to a book display. Toward the end of the scene, a small child is admitted for the purpose of buying a pamphlet and slapping the faces of the hostages. After exchanging their purchases and receiving their document, each customer raises his or her right arm in a Nazi salute, and leaves the store. The bookstore owner reads aloud from Mein Kampf. Mimicking the earlier scene of the camera crew following Eve Democracy is the last scene to the movie where the camera crew mills about on the beach and from afar one man asks another \\"What are they doing over there?\\" To which the other answers \\"I think they're shooting a movie\\". A large camera crane is positioned on the beach and another woman in white is laid down upon the end of the crane and elevated, along with a motion picture camera, on the platform until she is well above the beach. She doesn't rise up but remains motionless, half-hanging off the crane, one leg dangling. == Production == In 1968, Jean-Luc Godard moved to London intending to make a film about abortion. When he discovered that, due to the 1967 Abortion Act, it was no longer a hot topic, he told his producers he would still make a film in London, but on the condition that he would work with either the Beatles or the Rolling Stones. The Beatles turned him down, but the Rolling Stones were happy to collaborate. As a result, he was able to capture their work in progress as they rehearsed and recorded material for their seventh album, Beggars Banquet. The film was shot at the Olympic Recording Studios in London and at Camber Sands. In the original version running 104 minutes, Godard left the creation of the song unfinished. ==Release== 1 + 1 was shown at the 1968 London Film Festival and Godard punched producer Iain Quarrier in the face, for the changes made to the film's ending, including featuring the complete version of the song. Godard showed his original version under a London bridge for free after the screening. New Line Cinema acquired North America distribution rights and the film was shown as Sympathy for the Devil around college campuses during 1969 and 1970, including at University of California, Berkeley; University of Chicago and Hunter College in New York. An hour-long documentary about the making of the film was shown a week prior to the film being shown at the colleges. ==References== == External links == * Category:1968 films Category:French films Category:English-language films Category:English-language French films Category:Films directed by Jean-Luc Godard Category:The Rolling Stones films Category:Marxist works ","title":"Sympathy for the Devil (1968 film)"},{"id":"3230128","text":"James Diament Westcott Jr. (May 10, 1802January 19, 1880) was an American politician of the Democratic Party who served as the first Class 3 United States Senator from Florida from 1845 to 1849. ==Early life and career== Westcott was born in Alexandria, DC where his father, James Sr., was transitioning from newspaper publisher to politician.Chapter 6, Charles Holt's Generation James Jr.'s grandfather was a captain in the American Revolutionary War. When Westcott was young, his family moved to New Jersey where his father established a political career in the Assembly and as Secretary of State of New Jersey from 1830 to 1840. James Jr. married Rebecca Bacon Sibley on August 7, 1821.Cape May County, NJ, Records - Marriages from Liber B of Marriages, Archives of New Jersey. Note that Volume 8, number 1, January–February 2001, p. 11, gives his wife's name as Rebecca Sibley Bacon instead of Rebecca Bacon Sibley. He studied law and was admitted to the bar while still in his early 20s. In 1830, he moved to the Florida Territory and was appointed territory secretary by Andrew Jackson. His duties sometimes included performing the duties of the governor when the governor was away -- all while barely 30 years old. ==Duel== In 1832, Westcott ran afoul of a short-tempered fellow lawyer and Kentucky native, Thomas Baltzell. Baltzell challenged Westcott to a duel and the two met near the Alabama border on September 25. When the gunfire was over, Westcott was injured but survived while Baltzell escaped unharmed and eventually became a Florida Supreme Court chief justice. The exact reason for the duel was not disclosed in official papers.Justice Thomas Baltzell biography at Florida Supreme Court web site.Microsoft Word - Final Version.doc ==Birth of a state== Westcott served as territory secretary and a member of the Florida Territorial Legislative Council until 1834 and then as Attorney General of the territory's middle district until 1836. He then returned to the legislature as part of the convention to create a U.S. state constitution. When the first Florida Constitution was completed in 1838, Westcott's signature was present (as was that of his former duel-mate, Thomas Baltzell). Seven years later, with the constitution approved, Florida was officially a state. ==Senate== When Florida was admitted to the Union in 1845, Westcott ran for U.S. senator and was victorious. Westcott and fellow Democrat David Levy (Yulee) became the first U.S. Senators from the new state of Florida. In a choice by lot, Westcott was named a Class III senator while Levy was named a Class I meaning Westcott drew the shorter term of four years. While in the Senate, Westcott was the chairman on the Committee on Territories and the Committee on Patents and the Patent Office. He did not run for re-election in 1848. ==Post-Senate== Westcott's only term ended in 1849 and, in 1850, he moved to New York City and practiced law there until 1862. In 1862, Westcott moved to Canada where he remained until his death in Montreal. James Westcott's name remained in the Florida public eye as his son, also commonly referred to as James Diament Westcott Jr., became a member of the Florida House of Representatives, and was Florida Attorney General and a Florida Supreme Court Justice as well as a Captain in the Confederate States Army -- all before his untimely death at age 47. The younger Westcott left most of his estate to what is now Florida State University which, in turn, eventually named its main administration building in Tallahassee in his honor. ==See also== *List of United States Senators from Florida *United States congressional delegations from Florida ==References== * ==External links== *James Diament Westcott at PoliticalGraveyard.com Category:1802 births Category:1880 deaths Category:Politicians from Alexandria, Virginia Category:American people of English descent Category:Democratic Party United States senators from Florida Category:Florida Attorneys General Category:Members of the Florida Territorial Legislature Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Florida lawyers Category:Duellists Category:American expatriates in Canada ","title":"James Westcott"},{"id":"3230136","text":"The Pursuit Special, also referred to as the Last of the V8 Interceptors, is the iconic black GT Falcon muscle car featuring a distinctive supercharger driven by the title character Mad Max during much of the Mad Max franchise, where it appears in Mad Max, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior and in Mad Max: Fury Road, as well as both video games. ==Mad Max== The Pursuit Special MFP Interceptor as it appeared in Mad Max The first car shown in the film with the title of Pursuit Special is a 1972 HQ Holden Monaro V8 coupe stolen by Nightrider (played by Vince Gil), an escaped cop killer, who dies in an accident that destroys the vehicle. The more famous Pursuit Special is a heavily modified Ford Falcon XB GT, built on a vehicle originally assembled stock at the Ford plant in November 1973. Maxwell \\"Mad Max\\" Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) is offered the black Pursuit Special, as an incentive to stay on the force as their top pursuit man after he reveals his desire to resign. Although Max turns the offer down, he later uses the black car to exact his revenge on an outlaw motorcycle gang who killed his wife and son. ===Origins=== The vehicle started out as a standard white Australian built 1973 Ford Falcon XB GT Hardtop when in 1976, filmmakers Byron Kennedy and George Miller began preproduction on Mad Max. The movie's art director Jon Dowding designed the Interceptor and commissioned Melbourne-based car customizers Graf-X International to modify the GT Falcon. Peter Arcadipane, Ray Beckerley, John Evans, and painter Rod Smythe transformed the car as specified for the film. ===Modifications=== The main modifications are the black paint scheme, roof and boot spoilers, wheel arch flares, and front nose cone and air-dam designed by Arcadipane (marketed as the \\"Concorde\\" style). Also, eight individual exhaust side pipes were added (only two of them being functional, others appeared to be working because of the vibrations the first two created). The most famous feature of the car is a Weiand 6-71 supercharger protruding through the bonnet. The impressive looking supercharger, in reality, was nonfunctional; functional superchargers are typically driven constantly by the engine and cannot be switched on and off, as portrayed in the first two Mad Max films. ===Promotional use=== At the completion of filming, the producers could not pay all the creditors, so the black Interceptor was put up for sale. The blower and side pipes were removed to make it suitable for use as a road vehicle. It was then used as a promotional car for the film, before finally being put up for sale. However the car did not sell and was passed on to part- time actor and motor mechanic Murray Smith, who was the head mechanic for the movie's production team, as payment for his services. ==Mad Max 2 (The Road Warrior)== In the meantime, the low-budget Australian film had gained worldwide success, prompting a sequel, Mad Max 2. For the film, the Pursuit Special was reacquired by Kennedy and Miller. ===New modifications=== The rear wheels and side pipes were changed. For the second film, the original Weiand blower, which was removed and subsequently lost, was replaced. Unlike in the first film, this time the supercharger was functional (connected directly to the engine's crankshaft pulley) and the effect of the blower being engaged or disengaged was created by placing the vehicle on a low loader, and while in motion, the interceptor's engine was simply started or stopped. The car was cosmetically modified for the new post-apocalyptic setting with the addition of a pair of large cylindrical fuel tanks fitted in the rear (requiring the back window and boot lid to be removed) and its general appearance was given a more used look by painting the vehicle in matte rather than gloss black, and the paint was scrubbed off to appear rusty. The front end was also modified by removing the air dam. A duplicate car was also put together for the film. When the script required it to be destroyed by rolling down an embankment and eventually exploding, the duplicate interceptor was used, leaving the original vehicle intact. ===Disposal and restoration=== When production was completed, the intact Pursuit Special was sold to a wrecking yard in Broken Hill, along with other wrecks from the movie. The GT Falcon was then onsold to another wrecker in South Australia and in the mid-1980s, the car was rescued by Bob Fursenko, who restored the interceptor by having a new nose cone and air dam fitted, but retaining the fuel tanks from Mad Max 2. Fursenko confirmed the vehicle's authenticity with Kennedy Miller. It was subsequently shown widely in Australia before being sold by Fursenko and shipped to the Cars of the Stars Motor Museum in England, where it stayed until its closure in 2011. It was then relocated to the Dezer Car Museum in Miami, Florida. ==Mad Max: Fury Road== While the Pursuit Special did not appear in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, the vehicle returned for the fourth film in the franchise, Mad Max: Fury Road. Miller stated, \\"all the vehicles are kind of hybrid, cobbled together, from the wrecks of the past.\\" The vehicle only features briefly in the film; it is captured along with Max in the opening sequence, and is shown being repaired by a group of Immortan Joe's followers. It returns in the final battle, driven by one of the War Boys, only to be crushed between two larger vehicles. When asked in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter if Fury Road is a reboot or sequel, George Miller implied that it may not be, saying that \\"the films are loosely connected.\\" However, the comic book prequel to the film, for which Miller received a story credit, places it after Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. ==Story== On screen, Pursuit Specials are unique, undercover police cruisers which also serve as interceptors. At the opening of the first movie in the series, the only Pursuit Special is a 1972 HQ model Holden Monaro, which is rusty and used. It is stolen by the Night Rider, a member of a motorcycle gang called the Zed Runners (also known as the Acolytes), while escaping police custody, and is later wrecked. Pursuit Special, when the term is used, generally refers to Max's more famous V8 Interceptor Pursuit Special, a 1973 Ford XB Falcon GT 351, commissioned at great expense by Police Commissioner Labatouche and the Main Force Patrol's (MFP) commander, Fifi Macaffee. Assembled by the MFP's mechanic, Barry, it features port exhaust pipes and a Weiand \\"blower\\" supercharger (nonfunctional film props). When Max's family is murdered by the gang, he steals the Pursuit Special from the MFP garage and goes on a vengeful rampage. In Mad Max 2, set roughly five years after the events of the previous film, the Pursuit Special has suffered from the effects of the desert: it loses the front end early in the first chase sequence of the film (as Max forcefully rear-ends a raider vehicle), the car is rusty, and the tires appear to be in a poor state. The car itself has been modified, presumably by Max: the rear window and the boot lid have been removed to make room for two huge fuel tanks. (With a capacity of over of petrol, these would have significantly improved the vehicle's range.) The car only appears at the beginning of the movie, where Max escapes a group of raiders, then rescues a mortally wounded member of an oil rig settlement; and then again later, when it is destroyed during Max's failed attempt to escape the settlement. The Pursuit Special returns in Mad Max: Fury Road. The movie never explains its reappearance; however, the Fury Road comic series, set just before the movie, includes a story arc where Max gathers parts to rebuild the vehicle before the events of Fury Road. The car is shown very briefly in the movie, having been driven by Max before it is destroyed by Immortan Joe's men. It is then repaired by Joe's War Boys, taken back to bare metal, giving it a silver appearance. It is then redubbed the 'Razor Cola' and used as one of their vehicles. It is destroyed by being crushed between two larger trucks. ===Mad Max 2015 (video game)=== In the 2015 video game, Immortan Joe's son, Scabrous Scrotus, is a warlord of Gastown (the settlement referred to in Fury Road). His men steals Pursuit Special from Max at the start at the game and dismantle it. Max spends time with Chumbucket building a replacement throughout the game known as \\"the Magnum Opus\\", so he may cross the Plains of Silence, a barren stretch of salt flats that Max believes will relieve him of his nightmarish memories. In the final battle of the game, the Opus, now on par with the Interceptor, is destroyed along with both Scrotus' Land Mover, and the designer/caretaker of the Opus, Chumbucket. Max thinks he is now without a car, only to have Scrotus emerge with Max's Interceptor. After dispatching the warlord, Max reclaims his car, returns the picture of his family to the dashboard, and drives off into the wasteland. ==See also== *Muscle car (Australia) *Ford Falcon (Australia) *Police Interceptor Sedan *Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor ==References== ==External links== * Mad Max Movies – The most comprehensive Mad Max site online.

The osteoclasts are multi-nucleated cells that contain numerous mitochondria and lysosomes. These are the cells responsible for the resorption of bone. Osteoclasts are generally present on the outer layer of bone, just beneath the periosteum. Attachment of the osteoclast to the osteon begins the process. The osteoclast then induces an infolding of its cell membrane and secretes collagenase and other enzymes important in the resorption process. High levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphate and products of collagen will be released into the extracellular fluid as the osteoclasts tunnel into the mineralized bone. Osteoclasts are prominent in the tissue destruction found in psoriatic arthritis and rheumatological disorders. The human body is in a constant state of bone remodeling.Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology, 12th Edition. Bone remodelling is a process which maintains bone strength and ion homeostasis by replacing discrete parts of old bone with newly synthesized packets of proteinaceous matrix. Bone is resorbed by osteoclasts, and is deposited by osteoblasts in a process called ossification. Osteocyte activity plays a key role in this process. Conditions that result in a decrease in bone mass can either be caused by an increase in resorption or by a decrease in ossification. During childhood, bone formation exceeds resorption. As the aging process occurs, resorption exceeds formation. Bone resorption rates are much higher in post-menopausal older women due to estrogen deficiency related with menopause. Common treatments include drugs that increase bone mineral density. Bisphosphonates, RANKL inhibitors, SERMs—selective oestrogen receptor modulators, hormone replacement therapy and calcitonin are some of the common treatments. Light weight bearing exercise tends to eliminate the negative effects of bone resorption. ==Regulation== Bone resorption is highly stimulated or inhibited by signals from other parts of the body, depending on the demand for calcium. Calcium-sensing membrane receptors in the parathyroid gland monitor calcium levels in the extracellular fluid. Low levels of calcium stimulates the release of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from chief cells of the parathyroid gland. In addition to its effects on kidney and intestine, PTH increases the number and activity of osteoclasts. The increase in activity of already existing osteoclasts is the initial effect of PTH, and begins in minutes and increases over a few hours. Continued elevation of PTH levels increases the abundance of osteoclasts. This leads to a greater resorption of calcium and phosphate ions. High levels of calcium in the blood, on the other hand, leads to decreased PTH release from the parathyroid gland, decreasing the number and activity of osteoclasts, resulting in less bone resorption. Vitamin D increases absorption of calcium and phosphate in the intestinal tract, leading to elevated levels of plasma calcium, and thus lower bone resorption. Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) is the active form of vitamin D3.Institute of Medicine (US) Committee to Review Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin D and Calcium; Ross AC, Taylor CL, Yaktine AL, et al., editors. Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D. Washington (DC): National Academies Press (US); 2011. 3, Overview of Vitamin D. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56061/ It has numerous functions involved in blood calcium levels. Recent research indicates that calcitriol leads to a reduction in osteoclast formation, and bone resorption. It follows that an increase in vitamin D3 intake should lead to a decrease in bone resorption — it has been shown that oral administration of vitamin D does not linearly correlate to increased serum levels of calcifediol, the precursor to calcitriol. Calcitonin is a hormone secreted by the thyroid in humans. Calcitonin decreases osteoclast activity, and decreases the formation of new osteoclasts, resulting in decreased resorption. Calcitonin has a greater effect in young children than in adults, and plays a smaller role in bone remodeling than PTH. In some cases where bone resorption outpaces ossification, the bone is broken down much faster than it can be renewed. The bone becomes more porous and fragile, exposing people to the risk of fractures. Depending on where in the body bone resorption occurs, additional problems like tooth loss can arise. This can be caused by conditions such as hyperparathyroidism and hypovitaminosis D or even decreased hormonal production in the elderly. Some diseases with symptoms of decreased bone density are osteoporosis, and rickets. Some people who experience increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation are astronauts. Due to the condition of being in a zero-gravity environment, astronauts do not need to work their musculoskeletal system as hard as when on earth. Ossification decreases due to a lack of stress, while resorption increases, leading to a net decrease in bone density. == Alcoholism == The effects of alcohol on bone mineral density (BMD) are well-known and well-studied in animal and human populations. Through direct and indirect pathways, prolonged ethanol exposure increases fracture risk by decreasing bone mineral density and promoting osteoporosis. Indirect effects of alcohol abuse occur via growth hormone, sex steroids, and oxidative stress. Growth hormone is an important regulator of bone growth and remodeling in adults, and it acts via insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1) to stimulate osteoblastic differentiation. Chronic alcoholism decreases the levels of IGF1, which suppresses the ability of GH to increase bone mineral density. Increasing alcohol consumption is linked with decreasing testosterone and serum estradiol levels, which in turn lead to the activation of RANK (a TNF receptor) protein that promote osteoclast formation. Oxidative stress results when ethanol induces NOX expression, resulting in ROS production in osteoblasts which can ultimately result in cell senescence. Direct effects of chronic alcoholism are apparent in osteoblasts, osteoclasts and osteocytes. Ethanol suppresses the activity and differentiation of osteoblasts. At the same time, it has a direct effect on osteoclast activity. This results in an increased bone resorption rate and a decreased bone mineral density due to increased pit numbers and pit areas in the bone. Research has shown that viable osteocytes (another type of bone cell) may prevent osteoclastogenesis, whereas apoptotic osteocytes tend to induce osteoclast stimulation. Stimulation of osteocyte apoptosis by alcohol exposure may explain decreased bone mineral density in chronic drinkers. ==See also== * Bone remodeling * Nuclear factor-kappa B ==References== == External links == Category:Physiology Category:Animal developmental biology ","title":"Bone resorption"},{"id":"3230163","text":"James Diament Westcott, III (May 1, 1838 or June 18, 1838 – April 29, 1887), also known as James Diament Westcott, Jr., was an American politician from the state of Florida who served as the 19th Justice of the Florida Supreme Court. == Early life and education == Westcott was born in the city of Tallahassee in the Florida Territory on either May 1, 1838 or June 18, 1838. Westcott is the son of James Westcott, an early Florida politician who would later serve as its U.S. Senator. Although Westcott is the third in his family to share the name, he used the \\"Jr.\\" suffix rather than the \\"III\\" suffix throughout his life. Westcott studied at the West Florida Seminary. == Political career == In 1858, Westcott became the Assistant Secretary of the Florida Senate. The following year, he became the private secretary of Governor Madison S. Perry. During the American Civil War, served as an officer in the Confederate States Army, serving in the 1st Florida Infantry under the command of Brigadier General James Patton Anderson. Westcott served as Anderson's Commissary General and attained the rank of Captain. After his retirement from the Confederate States Army in 1864, Westcott served as the clerk of the C.S. District Court for Florida. After the end of the war, Westcott was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, representing Leon County, in 1866, though he would resign later that year. In the 1868 elections, Westcott, a Democrat, successfully ran for Florida Attorney General. This is despite the fact that both the 1868 Presidential election and 1868 Florida Governor election were both landslides for the Republican Party as a result of the 1868 Florida Constitution enfranchising freedmen, who mostly registered as Republicans. Additionally, many former Confederates, mostly Democrats, were still disenfranchised as part of Reconstruction. === Florida Supreme Court === Within a few weeks of assuming office as Attorney General in July 1868, Westcott was appointed to the Florida Supreme Court by Republican Governor Harrison Reed, making him the youngest justice in the Court's history. Despite their political differences, Reed saw potential in appointing Westcott to the Supreme Court. For one, it was important for Reed to appease the Southern Democrats by appointing one of their own to the Court, as it was filled with carpetbagger Republicans. Additionally, Westcott's friendly disposition on the one hand and thoroughness in researching the law and precedent on the other made in invaluable to the Court, and earned him respect from members of both parties. During his time on the Court, Westcott wrote 267 decisions, more than any other Justice up to that time except for Chief Justice Edwin M. Randall. In 1872, incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Thomas W. Osborn did not run for re-election. Westcott ran to succeed him, receiving the Democratic nomination. However, Westcott lost in the general election to Republican Simon B. Conover as a result of the continuing Republican wave during Reconstruction. Westcott continued to serve on the Florida Supreme Court until illness forced him to resign in 1885. == Death and legacy == Westcott died in Tallahassee, Florida on April 19, 1887 from the same illness that forced him to resign just two years earlier. Westcott is buried in Tallahassee's Old City Cemetery. Westcott, a lifelong bachelor, left his entire estate to his Alma mater, the West Florida Seminary, which was struggling at the time. In part thanks to his contribution, the college survived to become Florida State University. In December 1936, Florida State University renamed the Administration Building to the James D.

The current body was established in 1995, but there had also been a predecessor organisation, also called the BWMA, that was established in 1904, and lapsed after the First World War. ==Aim of the BWMA== The BWMA's stated aim is to uphold the freedom to use the Imperial system and to oppose the compulsory imposition of the metric system in the UK. The BWMA's campaign parallels the evolution of the eurosceptic viewpoint of the UK's relationship with the EUBWMA \\"Ministers' Metrication Conspiracy\\" \\\\- its founder, Vivian Linacre, stood for election as a UK Independence Party candidate in 1995, the same year as he founded the BWMA - famously asking the controversial eurosceptic Enoch Powell for endorsement of his political campaign.The Telegraph: \\"Nigel Farage and Enoch Powell\\" By the time of the modern BWMA's founding, metrication in the United Kingdom was far advanced, having begun in 1962. British schoolchildren had been educated using only metric measures since 1974 (earlier in some places), and British industry had changed to using metric tools and equipment during the 1980s and were, in most cases, manufacturing to metric standards. ===Campaigns=== * BWMA maintain that people should be free to use the metric system if they want, but that it should not be forced upon them. and specifically, the Association campaigns for freedom for traders to serve their customers in whichever measures both parties find most convenient. * BWMA campaigns against the metrication of road signsBWMA/Transport – De-metricated signs and in 2009 published their responseYardstick: Dec 2009 to a consultation hosted by the UK's Department for Transport which discussed a proposal to require compulsory dual Metric/Imperial signs of height limits and width limits. BWMA's responded that dual-units signage should not be made compulsory, and that the legal provisions (from the 1980s) allowing voluntary dual-units signage should be repealed so that only Imperial units could be displayed. This, the BWMA claimed, was to \\"avoid confusion.\\" * BWMA support the Metric Martyrs – a group of traders prosecuted for their defiance of the Weights and Measures ActResults within Legislation – Statute Law Database and the Price Marking Order.Results within Legislation – Statute Law Database * BWMA gives detailed advice on how traders can circumvent regulations mandating metric weights and measures.BWMA/Business Issues – Survival Guide to Metric Law * BWMA members have published a number of books arguing for customary measures.

In jurisdictions that use the term, it is differentiated from mistake of fact. There is a principle of law that \\"ignorance of the law is no excuse\\". In criminal cases, a mistake of law is not a recognized defense, though such a mistake may in very rare instances fall under the legal category of \\"exculpation\\". In criminal cases a mistake of fact is normally called simply, \\"mistake\\". ==General principles== Usually, there is in legal cases an irrebuttable presumption that people who are about to engage in an activity will comply with applicable law. As part of the rule of law, the law is assumed to be made available to everyone. The presumption of knowledge of applicable law generally will also apply in the situation of a recent change in the law with which a party in a legal case had no opportunity to become aware of it, e.g. the accused was out hunting in the wilderness and did not know that the law had changed to protect an endangered species. Some states make a distinction between a mistake as to the substance and effect of existing laws, and a mistake that the law creates a specific right to act in the particular way.Richard G. Singer, John Q. La Fond, Criminal Law (2010), p. 98-99. For example, if A, the owner of a vehicle, takes it into a garage for repair and when returning to collect it, A finds that the vehicle has been left parked in the street. If he has an honest belief that he has the right as an owner to retake possession of the vehicle without paying the outstanding bill for the repairs, he will not be considered as stealing it despite the fact that the garage holds a lien over the vehicle and so has the better right to possession until the bill is paid. This form of the defense is difficult to prove because the defendant must be able to prove that he believed in something more positive than the law permitted the particular behavior. The belief must be that the law creates and vests a specific right to act in that way. Under the Theft Act 1968 and the Criminal Damage Act 1971, a defense will arise if the defendant honestly believes that he is entitled to act in the way he did and this will negate the relevant mens rea element (e.g. of dishonesty under §2 Theft Act 1968). In Chamberlain v Lindon 1998 Lindon demolished a wall to protect a right-of-way, despite allowing nine months to pass before acting, Lindon honestly believed that it was immediately necessary to protect his legal rights without having to resort to civil litigation. For the purposes of §5(2): Thus a lawful excuse may be acknowledged by a court to arise when a person honestly but mistakenly believes that the actions are necessary and reasonable. ==Mistake of non-governing law in the United States== One narrow area of exception occurs where a person makes a mistake of non-governing law. While the accused are not pardoned for failure to know what acts have been deemed criminal, they may not be held to know of non-criminal provisions that affect the status of things that might therefore be deemed criminal.Richard G. Singer, John Q. La Fond, Criminal Law (2010), p. 104. For example, suppose Jennifer is married to Phillip, but decides to get a divorce in order to marry Ben. However, Jennifer mistakenly believes that the divorce was final when she submitted the paperwork required by the state, and did not realize that she had to wait for a court to pronounce her divorced. In the interim, she marries Ben, and so is technically committing bigamy because she has married a second man before her divorce from the first was complete. Jennifer's mistake was not one of governing law (she did not mistakenly believe it was legal to be married to two people), but rather a mistake of non-governing law, which is akin to a mistake of fact. Depending on the jurisdiction in which the act took place, Jennifer may be allowed to raise the defense of mistake of law in such a scenario. See Long v. State, 44 Del. 262. ==References== ==External links== *Turner, Christian, The Burden of Knowledge (July 21, 2008). Georgia Law Review, Forthcoming.

Its name means \\"South Ward.\\" It was established in 1955 when it was separated from Shimogyo-ku. As of April, 2016 the ward has an estimated population of 100,781 people. The Kamo River and the Katsura River flow through the district. It is home to several historical places and temples. Minami-ku is roughly bound on the east by the Kamo River, on the west by the Katsura River (although it extends over the Katsura River in some places), on the north by Hachijō Street and the JR Kyoto line (leading into Kyoto station), and on the south by the Meishin Expressway (although it extends over the expressway in some places). The southern portion of Kyoto city (including Minami-ku) is sometimes referred to as Rakunan. This area is the only side of Kyoto not lined with mountains, a feature that historically made Rakunan important as a gateway into Kyoto. Minami-ku is more working-class than some other Kyoto districts, and includes a large population of Korean nationals known as Zainichi Koreans. Instead of restaurants and clubs, portions of the land near the Kamo River are lined with factories and industrial buildings. Residential areas include both standard houses and apartments, and occasional government- subsidized housing projects. The area around Kujo Street from around Toji station to the Kamo River is known as Higashi (east) Kujo. This area is particularly working-class, and home to a relatively large number of Korean nationals and other working class members of Japanese society. As such, it has been called \\"Kyoto's only international town\\". Minami-ku has few notable areas of tourist interest compared to other parts of Kyoto. A notable exception is the To-ji Temple. The Minami-ku ward office is located on Route 1, near its intersection with Kujō Street. The Kyoto City Disaster Prevention Center is also in Minami-ku, near the intersection of Route 1 and Jujō Street. To the east of Minami-ku is Higashiyama-ku, and to the southeast is Fushimi-ku.

Light of the World was a substantially sized group and following various changes to the lineup, the founding members Breeze Mckrieth, Kenny Wellington & David Baptiste – inspired by American funk bands such as Funkadelic forming offshoot bands like Parliament – formed Beggar & Co. Bluey & Tubbs went on to form Incognito. However, there has seen a re-connection over the years in Light of the World with various former members, alongside their other commitments. Incognito has had intermittent success in the UK Singles Chart, with their breakthrough 1991 hit a cover version of the Ronnie Laws tune \\"Always There\\", featuring Jocelyn Brown, which made No. 6 in the UK. The group's 1992 single, \\"Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing\\" saw similar success, reaching No. 19 in the UK. They have also been a favourite of various re-mixers, including Masters at Work, David Morales, Roger Sanchez and Jazzanova, and have released several albums consisting almost entirely of remixes. In 1994, Incognito appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation album, Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as 'Album of the Year' by Time magazine. In 1996, the band contributed \\"Water to Drink\\" to the AIDS-benefit album Red Hot + Rio, also produced by the Red Hot Organization.

Brittany Daniel, Bill Paxton, and Jordan Ladd play supporting roles. Though the story is set on an island in Costa Rica, filming took place in Mexico. Club Dread was released on February 27, 2004, and grossed $7.6 million at the box office on a budget of $8.6 million, becoming a financial failure. The film received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics. ==Plot== Pleasure Island is a resort off the coast of Costa Rica, owned by famous musician Coconut Pete. Staff members Rolo, Stacy, and Kelly sneak into the jungle to have sex. They are ambushed by a masked figure, who stabs Rolo to death. The killer chases the girls through the jungle. The killer pushes Kelly off a cliff and decapitates Stacy before she can reach help. The resort staff remain unaware of the killings until Carlos' body is found behind the kitchen. Dave relates a story about a former employee named Phil Colletti who lost his mind and murdered his fellow staff members, before castrating himself and running away; though Pete insists it is a story made up to scare guests around the campfire, the mounting death toll suggests otherwise. Putman alerts the others when he finds Cliff murdered in a hedge maze. A message left by the killer suggests that he is targeting only the staff. All communication devices and transportation have been stolen or destroyed. Hank, a former FBI serial killing investigator, convinces the staff to continue with their jobs and allow him to catch the killer. Yu remains intent on warning the guests, despite warnings not to do so from the killer. When she lures the guests to the beach to make the announcement, she is attacked by the killer. Hank intervenes, but the killer slashes his throat and turns on Yu. Their bodies are found the next day. The staff begins to suspect one of the guests, Penelope. Juan, believing her innocent, tries to eliminate her as a suspect. Putman disappears into the jungle after having a nightmare. Sam and Dave find a shrine of photos of Lars and his friends, in which all of the faces except Lars' have been replaced with Pete's; suspicion turns on Lars and the staff lock Lars in the resort's Drunk Tank. The killer attempts to Kill Jenny by dropping a Television into the swimming pool, but Jenny escapes just in time, ultimately killing Dirk, one of the guests, who at the time, was attempting to make a lecherous pass at Jenny, while also completely oblivious to the situation, despite Jenny's futile attempts to warn him, and causing a power failure. Putman returns, and he and Jenny deduce that Lars is not the killer, and return to the drunk tank to release him, only to find that he has mysteriously escaped. When Pete is found dead as the result of Juan accidentally discovering it, whilst being goaded into revealing a secret, the staff members turn on each other, following an argument about Juan being incarcerated for raping a goat, as well as Dave's Parents being trampled to death years ago at a Coconut Pete concert. Partway through the argument, Lars returns and discovers Pete's body. Lars briefly grieves, before proceeding to lunge at Sam for locking him in the drunk tank in the first place. Just as everything escalates rapidly, Jenny calms everyone else down and tries to convince the group that they must work together to survive until the shuttle from the mainland returns for the guests. Juan leaves to seek out Penelope, Sam leaves out of mistrust for the group, with Dave following behind him. Putman leaves out of being haunted by dreams he had suffered whilst searching the jungle for clues, which culminated in his newfound reclusiveness. Dave manages to restore the electricity, seconds before the killer, having retrieved his machete, beheads Dave. Jenny and Lars are drawn by distorted music to the electricity hut where they find Dave's severed head. Thinking the killer is coming for them, Lars and Jenny hide under a bed. thinking quickly, Jenny places a nearby pair of handcuffs on what she believed to be the killer's feet, only to realize that she handcuffed Putman by mistake. just as Jenny and Lars come out of hiding, the killer appears and starts moving towards the trio. Putman attempts to fend off the killer by Launching Tennis balls at him with his racket, but the Killer craftily throws his Machete at Puttman, fatally stabbing him. With his terminal breath, he tells a guilty Jenny and Lars to hide. as Lars and Jenny follow his instructions, They hide in a shower and overhear Putman flippantly taunting the killer, before being repeatedly stabbed, thus ensuring his death. During a party in the nightclub, Jenny and Lars discover Dave's disembodied head. The Killer then reveals the corpses of his previous victims to the guests and a panic ensues. Juan, having discovered the deaths of Dave and Putman, whilst searching for Penelope, returns to join Lars and Jenny, with the killer's machete in his hand. Penelope, Juan, Lars and Jenny find Sam's apparently lifeless body in a mud bath. While they consider their next move, Sam leaps from the bath, forcefully snatches his stolen machete from Lars and grabs him. Sam reveals that although the castration rumor was false, he wanted to kill everyone on the island because Pete had intended to sell the island to the military, but decided to give the island to Dave, and also out of feeling betrayed that Rolo did not give him a bag of marijuana that he had previously loaned to him, instead lying about having none at all and simply sharing it with Stacy and Kelly, both respective events happening at the same time. Jealous and Enraged, Sam assumed that Dave would mismanage the resort and destroy it. Lars grabs the machete, allowing the others to escape. Penelope is lost among the party- crazed guests, and Jenny and Juan lock themselves in the nightclub. They see Sam drowning Penelope in a large tank. Juan smashes the tank and rescues Penelope. Sam prepares to kill them, but Lars appears and stabs Sam. Sam pursues Lars, Jenny, Penelope, and Juan as they escape through the jungle. Cornered on a cliff, they jump to the water below. They find the resort's damaged boats, and try to cobble together enough working parts to leave the island. Sam appears and kills Juan, then attacks Jenny and Penelope. noticing this, Lars breaks his vow of pacifism and overcomes Sam, and Sam is bisected by a rope attached to the power boat.

In 1902, the family moved to Hildesheim. Here Lorenz had his first contact with the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate. He went to the St. Karl Oblate boarding school in Limburg in the Netherlands from 1911 to 1916. In connection with this, he joined the Novitiate of the Oblates at Maria Engelport Monastery, although one month later, the monastery had to let him go because he had been called into the army. In the First World War, he fought as a corporal and a non-commissioned officer on the Western Front. For his bravery, he was awarded the Iron Cross, second class. After the war, he joined the monastery again, took his eternal vows on 25 July 1923, and a year later, was ordained a priest by the Bishop of Fulda, Joseph Damian Schmitt. Lorenz had his first posting in the People's Mission. Because he found it hard to deliver sermons, he was transferred to Schwerin. On 1 September 1939, he had to return to the military as a chaplain as the Second World War was looming. Once again, he received the Iron Cross for his bravery. In 1940, he returned to Schwerin.

It serves as the port for the town of St. George's, located on St. George's Island, to its north. To its south is St. David's Island. The harbour and both islands lie within St. George's Parish. It was for two centuries the primary harbour of the British Overseas Territory. ==Topography== The harbour separates St. George's Island in the north and west from St. David's Island in the south and east. Several other islands lie to the south and east, closing the harbour from the open sea to the east, and separating it from Smith's Sound, to the South. It is open to the Atlantic Ocean at Gunner Bay in the northeast, where its mouth is guarded by numerous islands, notably Smith's and Paget Islands. The waters of Bermuda are also protected by coral reef, which can be perilous to sailors. Several other islands lie within the harbour, notably the historically important Ordnance Island. In the south, a long channel, Ferry Reach, links the harbour with another opening to the Atlantic Ocean and the picturesque Castle Harbour. ==History== Castle Harbour (originally Southampton Harbour). The original channel used by shipping to access the harbour lies to the south of Paget Island. This was replaced a century ago by dredging out the passage to the north of Paget Island. At the time, the dredging of that passage had been necessary for St. George's to remain a viable port as steam replaced sail (permission for the dredging had to be granted by the Secretary of State for Defence as it would have enabled easier landing of an invading force. approval for this project, and for American investment into the Princess Hotel, was withheld 'til the Parliament of Bermuda agreed to raise a part-time reserve for the British army units in Bermuda). Most freight, today, is offloaded at Hamilton, but St. George's is still used for offloading of gravel and other consignments, by cruise ships visiting the Old Town, and it is the only port of entry for yachts, which must clear H.M. Customs and Bermuda Immigration at Ordnance Island before visiting other parts of the archipelago.Bermuda Tourism.Yachts (Private) Sailing to Bermuda, Page Eight To enter St. George's Harbour, sailors must fly a yellow quarantine flag, and navigate the ship towards the Customs dock. Boaters who don't bring their vessel through customs will be fined. Before passing through Bermuda customs, visitors must declare all medicines, and cannot bring fruits or vegetables into the country. Animals are only allowed to be brought to Bermuda if they have proof of health and a permit from the Bermuda Department of Environmental Protection. Confederate blockade runners are visible. The shore of St. George's Harbour was the site of the first settlements in Bermuda, which occurred in the early 17th century. The crew and passengers of the Sea Venture, driven onto the reefs off St. Catherine's Point in 1609, stayed on St. George's Island for nearly a year. When most departed, two men remained behind on Smith's Island, where a third rejoined them, later. When the first intentional settlers arrived from England in 1609, they settled very briefly on St. David's Island, before moving across the Harbour to create St. George's, the oldest continuously-inhabited English settlement in the New World. The harbour was well fortified during this time, as can still be seen in the several period forts located nearby.Complete text of The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles, first printed by I.D and I. H. for Michael Sparkes in 1624. Other editions followed in 1625, 1626, 1627, 1631, and 1632 The 19th Century saw the establishment of a Royal Naval base in Bermuda. Initially this was in St. George's Harbour, with the Royal Navy operating from facilities in Convict Bay (so called due to the prison hulks moored there) and within St. George's town. This build up began in 1795, but a decade later, the Royal Navy was actively developing the dockyard on Ireland Island, and it soon withdrew from St. George's completely.The Andrew And The Onions: The Story Of The Royal Navy In Bermuda, 1795–1975, Lt. Commander Ian Strannack, The Bermuda Maritime Museum Press, The Bermuda Maritime Museum, P.O. Box MA 133, Mangrove Bay, Bermuda MA BX. The buildup of the dockyard at the West End of the archipelago still resulted in considerable defence infrastructure around St. George's, at the East End, however, as this was the gateway through the surrounding reefs to all of Bermuda. In addition to the 17th and 18th century forts built by the militia, there are many 19th and 20th Century forts and batteries built by the regular British Army on the islands surrounding the harbour, for which Ordnance Island was the primary ammunition depot. The various surviving East End forts, batteries and other military structures, together with the old capital, have been declared by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as a World Heritage Site, the Historic Town of St George and Related Fortifications, Bermuda.Bermuda Forts 1612–1957, Dr. Edward C.

The mechanism can exist in free markets or in captive or controlling markets that seek to use supply and demand, or some other form of charging for scarcity, to choose among production possibilities. In a free market economy, all the resources are allocated by the private sector (individuals, households, and groups of individuals); in a planned economy, all the resources are owned by the public sector (local and central government); and, in a mixed economy, some resources are owned by both sectors, private and public. In reality the first two are mostly theoretical and the third is common. Resources are allocated according to the forces of supply and demand. Government interference in the market mechanism leads to economic inefficiency when it is applied to private goods. Prices convey a lot of information. They not only tell producers what to produce but also inform the producers to produce what people want. The more inaccurate the information gets, the lesser will be the economic coordination which will in turn lower satisfaction of wants. Thus interference in the information conveyed by prices is destructive to economic development if misapplied or overused. However, the market mechanism often cannot optimize for public goods, owing to problems such as the tragedy of the commons. For example, modern highways have been good for economic development, but it has taken government planning and allocation to bring them into existence. Other market mechanisms include government fiscal policy and monetary policy. Described by the Friedman rule proposed by Milton Friedman.M. Friedman (1969), The Optimum Quantity of Money, Macmillan These policies will influence demand by price adjustments through taxes and charges and through adjustments to the value of money by the related supply of money. == See also == *Capitalism *Price mechanism ==References== Category:Market (economics) ","title":"Market mechanism"},{"id":"3230349","text":"Nijō Castle in Nakagyō-ku is famous for architecture and gardens. is one of the eleven wards in the city of Kyoto, in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan.

When the group discovers that they somehow went through five bottles of wine, they realise exactly what puts the \\"Fun\\" in Fun Bobby: alcohol. Monica convinces him to quit drinking, which turns out to be a bad idea – he becomes, as Chandler refers to him, \\"Ridiculously Dull Bobby\\". In order to put up with Bobby's boring stories, Monica develops a drinking habit of her own. Bobby then dumps her because he doesn't feel he can be in a co-dependent relationship. Meanwhile, Rachel starts dating Russ, a periodontist who bears an eerie resemblance to Ross (although at first, Rachel thinks Russ reminds her of Bob Saget). She remains oblivious to the group's concerns until she catches Ross and Russ arguing, sees the similarities, and freaks out. Joey's agent, Estelle, gets him an audition for a part on Days of Our Lives. The catch: he has to sleep with the casting agent to get the part, and gets conflicted, wanting to advance his career but not wanting it to be because of a fling. At the audition, he flat out refuses to sleep with the casting agent, showing integrity for his career. As he goes to leave, the casting agent catches up to Joey and offers him an even bigger role: the part of \\"Dr. Drake Ramoray\\", recurring in at least four episodes, which he accepts. At the end of the episode, Russ comes into Central Perk and reveals to Chandler and Phoebe that Rachel broke up with him, telling him he reminds her too much of someone else but she cannot figure out who.

The album was produced by John Goodmanson and recorded from December 1999 to January 2000 at Jackpot! Studio in Portland, Oregon and John & Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. The music on the record ranges from soft melodies to fast punk rock guitar work, while the lyrics address multiple media issues, such as the image of women in rock, music journalism, and violence as entertainment, among others. Upon release, All Hands on the Bad One reached number 177 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and number 12 on the Heatseekers Albums chart. One song from the album, \\"You're No Rock n' Roll Fun\\", was released as a single. The album received positive reviews from critics, with an aggregate review score of 86 out of 100 at Metacritic. Critics generally praised the album's consistency and Corin Tucker's vocals. All Hands on the Bad One appeared in several end-of-year lists and received a nomination for Outstanding Music Album at the 12th Annual Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation Awards. ==Background and recording== All Hands on the Bad One is the follow-up to Sleater-Kinney's highly acclaimed fourth album The Hot Rock, released in 1999. The Hot Rock marked a considerable change in the band's sound, veering into a more relaxed and gloomy direction than the raucous punk rock style of its predecessors. It was also the first Sleater-Kinney album that entered the US Billboard Top 200 chart, peaking at number 181. Some fans, however, dismissed the album, claiming that the band had sold out and that it was a commercial album. This criticism was something that singer and guitarist Corin Tucker strongly disagreed with, claiming that The Hot Rock was their least commercial album due to its longer and intricate pieces. According to Tucker, \\"we wanted to be doing difficult work. We wanted to be expanding as musicians and people didn't want that from us. They wanted us to jump around and yell.\\" After expanding their musical boundaries with The Hot Rock, the band decided not to worry about what their next album was going to sound like. Tucker explained, \\"It was so spontaneous [...] The songs just kept popping up one after another. We didn't really talk about anything. It just kind of happened.\\" She also said that they wanted to write songs that were \\"really straightforward but also a bit more mature in their structure and delivery than [their] earlier songs.\\" All Hands on the Bad One is also the first Sleater-Kinney album where drummer Janet Weiss provides backing vocals on some tracks. Tucker remarked that they initially wanted her to sing on The Hot Rock, but the idea was ultimately rejected due to the album's complex melodies. All Hands on the Bad One was produced by John Goodmanson, who previously produced the band's third studio album, Dig Me Out. The band decided to work with him again because, according to Weiss, Goodmanson \\"has the incredible ability of capturing our live sound and heightening it, so we sound better\\". The album was recorded from December 1999 to January 2000 at Jackpot! Recording Studio in Portland, Oregon and John & Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. ==Music and lyrics== Similar to other Sleater-Kinney albums, the lyrics of All Hands on the Bad One feature personal, political, and social themes. The first song, \\"The Ballad of the Ladyman\\", is a deliberate attempt to mock those who misunderstand the band. Tucker said that the song is \\"almost making fun of how people see us, how people see what you're supposed to be when you're a woman in rock.\\" The song was inspired when the band was invited to the Bowlie Weekender music festival in England in 1999. Tucker explained, \\"We were all staying in little chalets or whatever and we had our own cabin and we were cabin 216. Someone wrote this message to us that was like, 'Cabin 216 ladymen.' And we were like, 'What?' It was meant to be a funny thing, but in this other way, it was really this naming of us. It was a subtle way of saying, 'Oh, you're different because you're a woman band and because you're in some ways political.' It's still seen as threatening to people. It's not like we had this weekend where we just relaxed with everyone and just hung out.\\" Kat Iudicello, writing for PopMatters, stated that the song \\"sports sweet harmonies, a slow anger and soft, low bitterness, and driving steady guitars and drums.\\" The song \\"Male Model\\" targets the male role models for female rock bands, while \\"Pompeii\\" explores soul-searching themes such as one's losses and anxieties. \\"Youth Decay\\" was described by PopMatters as a song that \\"grapples with adult disbelief of the problems of youth and the manifestations of it in terms of eating disorders and silence.\\" It features fast punk rock guitar work. The lyrics to \\"#1 Must-Have\\" reference images of the riot grrrl scene in the mainstream media. It was written when Tucker was preparing for an interview about the subject, held by the EMP Museum in Olympia, Washington. The song also alludes to the misogyny that took place at the Woodstock '99 music festival, where several women were raped. Similarly, the song \\"Was It a Lie?\\" is a protest against how violence is used as entertainment in the media. \\"The Professional\\" aims at music journalism and contains heavy drum work, while \\"Ironclad\\" features \\"fuzzed-out riffs and pounding fills\\". Other songs such as \\"Leave You Behind\\" and \\"The Swimmer\\" feature soft melodies and harmonies. \\"You're No Rock n' Roll Fun\\" was described as \\"easy moving, beach punk rock music\\". \\"Milkshake n' Honey\\" was considered to be the band's funkiest song. Pitchfork commented that the song \\"spits wit at expatriates in Paris as Corin rolls her eyes at the type of denizens in The Sun Also Rises.\\" The song \\"All Hands on the Bad One\\" features guitar riffs that are reminiscent of the band's second album, Call the Doctor. It was chosen as the title track because, according to guitarist Carrie Brownstein, it is the song that best represents the sentiment of the album. Brownstein explained that the song deals with \\"your relationship to evil and your relationship to the hypocrisy of forcing a morality on someone else when you yourself are no better.\\" She added, \\"'Ballad of the Ladyman', for instance—who is 'the ladyman'? Is the person that wants to be on the radio, 'the bad one,' or is it the fans assuming that they [the artist] want to be on the radio—are they 'the bad one'? Or is 'The Professional,' the ominous professional figure, 'the bad one'? I think all these songs can go into that machine of 'the bad one' and that mentality and then be spit out in a bunch of different scenarios. So that's why I think it works as the title.\\" ==Release== All Hands on the Bad One was released on May 2, 2000, by the independent record label Kill Rock Stars, which also released the band's previous two albums. The album cover features a photo of Brownstein being hauled off a dance floor. According to Weiss, \\"She worked herself into a frenzy and passed out. People are laughing in the background because she's wearing a bunny suit.\\" All Hands on the Bad One reached number 177 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart, #12 on the Heatseekers Albums chart, and #5 on the KEXP Top 90.3 Album Chart for 2000. The band promoted the album with a tour across North America and England, featuring old and new songs. The band also did the set-up and sold merchandise themselves. As of August 2002, the album has sold 73,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan. As of February 2015, All Hands on the Bad One has sold 98,000 copies. The song \\"You're No Rock n' Roll Fun\\" was released as a single on the same day as the album, featuring an outtake, \\"Maraca\\", as the B-side. In the United Kingdom, the single was released by Matador Records in both vinyl and compact disc formats. The compact disc version includes a third song, \\"What If I Was Right\\", which is an outtake from the studio sessions for The Hot Rock that was previously released on Kill Rock Stars' Jackson's Jukebox compilation album. A music video was made for \\"You're No Rock n' Roll Fun\\" under the direction of Brett Vapnek, who previously worked on music videos by Helium and Cat Power. ==Critical reception== All Hands on the Bad One received very positive reviews from critics. Pitchfork reviewer Brent DiCrescenzo described it as the band's most melodic, playful, sarcastic, and punchy album to date. Similarly, Kat Iudicello of PopMatters felt that the album features \\"lovely harmonies, brilliant drum work, great punk rock guitar riffs, and super-smart lyrics.\\" St. Petersburg Times writer Alan Rittner commented, \\"Sleater-Kinney's confidence and sense of freedom translate into the most relentless instrumental work of the band's career, with no loss in its peerless songcraft.\\" Some critics also praised the album's consistency. According to The A.V. Club, \\"what makes All Hands On The Bad One so distinctive is Sleater- Kinney's dedication to craft as well as spontaneous passion: Song for song, this could be its best album.\\" Further praise was given to Tucker's voice. Pitchfork opined that \\"Corin reveals greater character depth than ever before\\" while NME commented that she \\"is Siouxsie on 'Youth Decay', a sassy Francophile lover on 'Milkshake n' Honey' and all West Coast beach babe on the immensely pretty 'Leave You Behind'.\\" Steve Huey, writing for AllMusic, gave high marks to Tucker and Brownstein's guitar interplay as well as Weiss' backing vocals, stating that the band \\"makes full use of that extra instrument, packing the tracks with lilting three-part harmonies.\\" The Southland Times notably praised the album's maturity and assertiveness, commenting that the band \\"has also created a more melodic sound and tunes are catchier and more accomplished with Tucker's vocals sounding more confident and tuneful than ever.\\" The A.V. Club pointed out that \\"Corin Tucker's Belinda Carlisle vibrato has never sounded better [...], while Carrie Brownstein's straight counterpoint keeps the songs grounded in punk-rock fury.\\" In a mixed review, Arion Berger of Rolling Stone magazine noted that Sleater-Kinney \\"have remade rock aggression as thinking-women's work and handled punk with finesse\\", but also criticized the writing of some tracks for being \\"awfully self-conscious for a fifth album.\\" The Village Voice reviewer Howard Hampton compared the album's music favorably to The Go-Go's' Beauty and the Beat, even though he remarked that instead of \\"[settling] for The Go-Go's demure ministrations\\", All Hands on the Bad One \\"means to work the whole loving fist all the way up your tight little mind.\\" In a very favorable review, a writer for The Guardian concluded that the album \\"explains exactly why one US mag called [Sleater-Kinney] the best rock'n'roll band in America.\\" All Hands on the Bad One appeared in several end-of-year lists. Pitchfork placed the record at number 16 in its list of \\"Top 20 Albums of 2000\\", commenting \\"Sleater- Kinney chanced losing some riot [grrrl] cred in favor of writing songs that cover a more diverse spectrum of emotions and themes, and came up their most compelling and political record to date\\". Toronto Star rated it the eighth best album of the year, Edmonton Journal named it one of the best album of the year, and The Village Voice placed it #10 in its 2000 Pazz & Jop Critics' Poll. All Hands on the Bad One also received a nomination for Outstanding Music Album at the 12th Annual Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation Awards, but lost to k.d. lang's Invincible Summer. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes. ;Sleater- Kinney * Carrie Brownstein – guitar, vocals * Corin Tucker – vocals, guitar * Janet Weiss – drums, percussion, vocals ;Additional musicians * Sam Coomes – mellotron on \\"Milkshake n' Honey\\" * Sarah Dougher – organ on \\"All Hands on the Bad One\\" and \\"The Swimmer\\" ;Technical personnel * Greg Calbi – mastering * Larry Crane – engineering * John Goodmanson – production ==References== ==External links== * Category:2000 albums Category:Albums produced by John Goodmanson Category:Kill Rock Stars albums Category:Sleater-Kinney albums Category:Matador Records albums Category:Sub Pop albums ","title":"All Hands on the Bad One"},{"id":"3230383","text":"EBE or Ebe may refer to: == People == ;Given name * Ebe Stignani (1903–1974), Italian opera singer * Ebe W.

Guaimar extended his suzerainty over the Duchy of Amalfi and Principality of Capua and also over much of the purple-shaded lands belonging to Byzantium. Guaimar IVAlso Waimar, Gaimar, Guaimaro, Guaimario, Guaimarius, or Weimarius. According to a revised genealogy by Huguette Taviana-Carozzi, he is sometimes numbered Guaimar V. Gravett, 132, calls him \\"the Iron Hand.\\" (c. 1013 - 2, 3 or 4 June 1052) was Prince of Salerno (1027-1052),According to the Catalogum Principum Salerni, he ruled for 34 years and 17 days. Duke of Amalfi (1039-1052), Duke of Gaeta (1040-1041), and Prince of Capua (1038-1047) in Southern Italy over the period from 1027 to 1052. He was an important figure in the final phase of Byzantine authority in the Mezzogiorno and the commencement of Norman power. He was, according to Amatus of Montecassino, \\"more courageous than his father, more generous and more courteous; indeed he possessed all the qualities a layman should have—except that he took an excessive delight in women.\\"Cestui Gamérie estoit plus vaillant que le père et plus liberal et courtois à donner, liquel estoit aorné de toutes les vertus que home sécular doit avoir fors de tant que moult se délictoit de avoir moult de fames. ==Early conquests== He was born around the year 1013, the eldest son of Guaimar III of Salerno by Gaitelgrima, daughter of Duke Pandulf II of Benevento. His elder half-brother, the son of Porpora of Tabellaria, John (III) reigned as co-prince from 1015. When he died in 1018, Guaimar was made co-prince. In 1022, the Emperor Henry II campaigned in southern Italy against the Greeks and sent Pilgrim, Archbishop of Cologne, to attack Pandulf IV of Capua, nicknamed the \\"Wolf of the Abruzzi\\", and Guaimar of Salerno. Pandulf was captured and Guaimar submitted, sending the younger Guaimar as a hostage. The emperor remanded him to Pope Benedict VIII and he was released. The younger Guaimar succeeded his father in Salerno in 1027 (at the age of fourteen or sixteen, possibly under the regency of his mother during his brief minority). He embarked then on a lifelong quest to control the whole of the southern third of the Italian Peninsula. In 1036, he received word that his uncle and erstwhile ally, Pandulf of Capua, had attempted to rape his niece, the daughter of his wife's sister and the Duke of Sorrento.The identity of this duke is unknown, but he must have been the local ruler displaced by Pandulf in 1034. He had previously repudiated his wife, Guaimar's sister-in-law. He then received the homage of the defecting Rainulf Drengot, formerly a vassal of Pandulf. Thus, Guaimar won the support of the Normans in the Mezzogiorno. In 1037, Guaimar made the politically savvy request of arbitration to both the Holy Roman and Byzantine emperors over the issue of Pandulf's unfitness to rule. Emperor Conrad II accepted the invitation and traveled south in Spring 1038. He demanded hostages from Pandulf. However, the hostages escaped and Capua was promptly besieged. Having taken that principality, he gave it to Guaimar (May),Chalandon, 83. Guaimar consistently dated his reign in Capua from August or September, not May. who asked for a title of nobility for his new Norman vassal. This was granted and Rainulf officially became \\"Count of Aversa\\" and a vassal of Salerno. Guaimar set out to take possession of his new principality immediately. On 15 August, he conquered Rocca Vandra and gave it to the abbey of Monte Cassino. Meanwhile, the Normans of Aversa pacified the valley of the Sangro. After Pandulf fled to Constantinople, Guaimar turned his attention to Amalfi. In April 1039, in support of the deposed and blinded Manso II, Guaimar forced the abdication and exile of John II and his mother, Maria, a sister of Pandulf. Guaimar installed himself as duke. Then in July, he conquered Sorrento, which had been conquered by Pandulf in 1034.Chalandon, 86. The Catholic Encyclopedia gives a date of 1035 for Guaimar's conquest. He gave it to his brother Guy with the title of duke. He also received the homage of the Duke of Naples, John V, who had brought the request for mediation to Constantinople in 1037. In the north, he brought Comino, Aquino, Traetto (May 1039), Venafro (October 1040), Pontecorvo, and Sora under his rule. In June 1040, he took Gaeta, which had been conquered by Pandulf in 1032. After October 1041, Guaimar ceases to appear in the acts of Gaeta and it seems he was replaced by a popular usurper related to the old dynasty, Leo. By December 1042, however, Gaeta was in the hands of Rainulf, holding it from Guaimar. ==Hauteville alliance== Soon after, he became involved with the Hautevilles. The Byzantines, who had not responded to Guaimar's earlier request for help, were preparing an expedition under the great general Giorgio Maniace. Guaimar sent, at their request, a cohort of Lombard and Norman warriors, the first of which was one William, who, in Sicily, won the epithet \\"Iron Arm\\". In 1038, the Normans and Lombards returned in a rebellious state and quickly invaded Greek Apulia. In this, Guaimar supported them and, in 1042, they elected William Iron Arm as count and sought the approval of Guaimar, whom they acclaimed, in full opposition to any Byzantine claims, Duke of Apulia and Calabria (1043). Guaimar, in accordance with good feudal theory, granted them Melfi and the republican model on which it was set up. The feudal grounding was not so good in law, however. Guaimar was only duke by acclamation of the men he appointed as vassals and it was by the authority of the ducal title that he installed them in Melfi. This would cause him trouble later. In 1044, he and the Iron Arm began to take Calabria and built a large castle at Squillace. In his later years, he had trouble retaining his possessions in the face of the Holy Roman Emperor and the Normans. Rainulf Drengot, who still held Aversa, originally from the Duke of Naples, died in 1045 and his county passed, against all protestation from Guaimar, to his nephew Asclettin. Later in that same year, Guaimar opposed the succession of Asclettin's cousin Rainulf Trincanocte, but again was overridden. These quarrels led the once- loyal Aversa to return its allegiance to Pandulf, lately returned from exile in Constantinople. War with Pandulf continued from 1042 to 1047. Guaimar secured his own position, however, by recognising William's brother Drogo shortly after William's death in 1046 and by giving him his sister Gaitelgrima in marriage. ==Later reversals== In 1047, however, Guaimar's life's work was undone. In that year Emperor Henry III came to demand homage from the dukes of the south. He returned Capua to Pandulf and took Aversa and Melfi directly under his suzerainty. Finally, he deprived Guaimar of his title over Apulia and Calabria, bringing to an end that troublesome feudal oddity. The emperor also besieged Benevento, where Empress Agnes was being held while the gates were shut to him. At that point, Daufer, the future Pope Victor III, brother of Pandulf III of Benevento, fled the city and sought the protection of Guaimar, who gave him refuge in La Trinità della Cava. Daufer's nephew Landulf personally traveled to Salerno to meet with Guaimar and negotiate the return of Daufer. Daufer was returned with the promise that his choice of a monastic vocation would be respected. In 1048, Pandulf, once again prince of Capua, was at war with Guaimar. On the death in that year of Rainulf II of Aversa (Rainulf Trincanocte), his succeeding son Herman, an infant, required a regent. The first appointment, Bellebouche, was a failure. Richard Drengot, a cousin of Herman's, was then in a Melfitan prison for making war on Drogo. Guaimar soon procured his release and personally brought him to Aversa, where he was installed as regent, and later as count in his own right. Thus, Guaimar recaptured the allegiance of Aversa. ==Assassination== At a synod in Benevento in July 1051, Pope Leo IX besought Guaimar and Drogo to stop the Norman incursions on church lands. Soon Drogo was assassinated, probably by a Byzantine conspiracy. The next year, Guaimar too was assassinated in the harbour of his capital. The four assassins were the brothers of his wife Gemma. Guaimar's brother Pandulf of Capaccio was also killed, but Guy of Sorrento escaped while Guaimar's sister and niece were locked up. The brothers-in-law seized the city and elected Pandulf, eldest among them, prince. The date of Guaimar's assassination is given as 2 June in the Annales Beneventani, as 3 June in Amatus and as 4 June in the necrology of Monte Cassino.Amatus of Montecassino; Prescott N. Dunbar, trans.; Graham A. Loud, ed., The History of the Normans (Boydell Press, 2004), p. 96. Guy fled to the Normans and soon the four conspirators were besieged in Salerno by a large Norman force and Guy's Sorrentine army. The assassins' families soon fell into their enemies' hands and they negotiated their release by releasing Gisulf, Guaimar's son and heir, to Guy. Guy accepted their surrender soon after, promising not to harm them. The Normans, however, who maintained they were not bound by Guy's oath, massacred the four brothers and thirty-six others, one for each stab wound found in Guaimar's body. Thus the Normans showed their loyalty to Guaimar even after his death. Guaimar's legacy includes his dominion, either by conquest or otherwise, over Salerno, Amalfi, Gaeta, Naples, Sorrento, Apulia, Calabria, and Capua at one time or another. He was the last great Lombard prince of the south, but perhaps he is best known for his character, which the Lord Norwich sums up this way: \\"...without once breaking a promise or betraying a trust. Up to the day he died his honour and good faith had never once been called in question.\\"Norwich, 88. Peter Damian, a contemporary, in a tract written for Pope Nicholas II, held a different view: Guaimar \\"was killed by the sword because of his many acts of violence and tyrannical oppression\\". ==Family== Guaimar married Gemma, a daughter of the Capuan Count Laidulf. They were married before 1032. They had six sons, five of whom outlived them, and at least four daughters. In 1037, Guaimar had made his eldest son John co-prince as John IV, but John died in 1039. Guaimar was succeeded by his second son Gisulf II (co-prince since 1042), whom the Normans put under their protection. His third son was Landulf, Lord of Policastro. His fourth son Guy was an ally of Robert Guiscard. His fifth son was John, Abbot of Curte. His youngest son, Guaimar, co-ruled with his brother Gisulf. Guaimar's eldest daughter was Sichelgaita, who married Robert Guiscard. His younger daughter was Gaitelgrima, whom he married to Drogo after William's death. She brought with her a large dowry. She married twice more: to Robert, Count of Monte Sant'Angelo, and to a Count Alfred. Humphrey, Drogo's brother and successor, is said to have married a daughter of Guaimar's, often assumed to be the widow of his brother, but this is impossible. Also, Jordan I of Capua is said to have married a woman named \\"Gatteclina\\", a sister of Sichelgaita. ==Notes== ==References== *Gwatkin, H. M., Whitney, J. P. (ed) et al.

It was produced by Roger Moutenot and recorded at the Avast! recording studio in Seattle, Washington in July 1998. The Hot Rock marks a considerable change in the band's sound, veering into a more relaxed and gloomy direction than the raucous punk rock style of its predecessors. The lyrical themes of the album explore issues of failed relationships and personal uncertainty. Upon release, The Hot Rock reached number 181 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and number 12 on the Heatseekers Albums chart, becoming the first Sleater-Kinney album to enter the charts. Two songs from the album, \\"Get Up\\" and \\"A Quarter to Three\\", were released as singles. The album received positive reviews from music critics, who praised the songwriting and the vocal and guitar interplay between band members Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein. ==Background and recording== The Hot Rock is the follow-up to Sleater-Kinney's highly acclaimed third album Dig Me Out, released in 1997 by the independent record label Kill Rock Stars. After the success of Dig Me Out and its predecessor Call the Doctor, several major record labels grew interested in the band and offered them recording contracts, but the band ultimately decided to remain on Kill Rock Stars. As singer and guitarist Corin Tucker recalls, \\"We want to project the image that we're successful\\". Co-vocalist and guitarist Carrie Brownstein added, \\"And we're proud that we've been able to do that from a tiny label [...] We've been able to do it non-traditionally, and hopefully that's inspiring and encouraging to people\\". For its fourth album, Sleater-Kinney wanted to work with producer Roger Moutenot due to his textural work on Yo La Tengo's critically acclaimed 1997 album I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One. This marked a change from regular producer John Goodmanson, who had recorded every previous Sleater-Kinney album. As Tucker explained, \\"These songs warranted a different production, so we looked to other people\\". The band wanted to expand their sound and challenge themselves in new ways, stating that it was important for them not to make the same record twice. According to Tucker, \\"We have to keep pushing in order to stay interested in making music together, we want to have longevity as a band\\". Similarly, drummer Janet Weiss stated that they \\"wanted the record to sound different than Dig Me Out, to make each song have a real strong personality\\". The album was written over the course of a year, which was the longest period the band had spent on making an album. It was recorded at the Avast! recording studio in Seattle, Washington in July 1998. ==Music and lyrics== The Hot Rock marks a considerable change in the band's sound, veering into a more relaxed and gloomy direction than the raucous punk rock style of its predecessors. As Rolling Stone noted, Sleater- Kinney \\"delved into more oblique sounds [...] Brownstein's abandoned power chords to slither in abstract patterns, backed by Weiss' increasingly subtle and complex drumming [and] Tucker expanded her vocal range steering from bellow to fragile ululations\\". Likewise, The Village Voice writer Sara Sherr considered The Hot Rock to be Sleater-Kinney's darkest album. Brownstein remarked that the album's sound and lyrics were heavily influenced by the music of The Go-Betweens. Unlike previous Sleater-Kinney albums, most of the lyrical themes on The Hot Rock are more intimate, exploring failed relationships and personal uncertainty. As Weiss recalled, the songs are \\"really honest, even if they're sometimes unpleasant. The lyrics evoke so many emotions. Our analogies are visual and the metaphors are direct. Corin and Carrie are singing about things they care about\\". The album features a notable amount of vocal and guitar interplay between Tucker and Brownstein, who interweave their voices and play off each other to create very atmospheric songs such as \\"The End of You\\" and \\"Burn Don't Freeze\\". Music critic Robert Christgau said that \\"even reading the booklet it's hard to keep track of who's saying what to whom about what, as if they'd fallen in love with (or to) the Velvets' 'Murder Mystery'\\". The title track \\"Hot Rock\\", named after the 1972 film of the same name, notes the similarities between relationships and jewelry heists. The song \\"Banned from the End of the World\\" deals with the Y2K crisis and an uncertain future, while \\"God Is a Number\\" alludes to the impact of technology in society. The single \\"Get Up\\" features lead guitar lines by Brownstein and staccato riffs by Tucker. For Tucker, the song reflects the album's thematic structure: \\"It's more metaphorical and spiritual [...] It's not about one concrete thing; it's about searching for meaning and maybe finding it an unexpected place\\". The tracks \\"The Size of Our Love\\" and \\"Memorize Your Lines\\" feature violin lines by Seth Warren of Red Stars Theory. The Village Voice described the former song, a ballad about two lovers in trouble, as \\"the saddest of the sad\\". The last song, \\"A Quarter to Three\\", features slide guitar work by the album's producer. ==Release== The Hot Rock was released on February 23, 1999, by Kill Rock Stars. The album cover is a photo shot on Southwest Broadway in Portland, Oregon. The Hot Rock reached number 181 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and number 12 on the Heatseekers Albums chart, becoming the first Sleater-Kinney album to enter the charts. After its release, the band supported the album with a tour across the United States, sharing stages with various bands including Sonic Youth, Guided by Voices, Bratmobile, and Superchunk. As of July 1999, the album has sold 42,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan. As of February 2015, The Hot Rock has sold 97,000 copies. Two songs from the album, \\"Get Up\\" and \\"A Quarter to Three\\", were released as singles on January 22, 1999, and April 6, 1999, by Kill Rock Stars and Matador Records respectively. The first single features an outtake, \\"By The Time You're Twenty Five\\", as the B-side, while the second single features \\"Burn, Don't Freeze\\" from The Hot Rock. The CD version of \\"Get Up\\" includes a third song, \\"Tapping\\", which is another outtake from the album's studio sessions. A music video was made for \\"Get Up\\" under the direction of writer and performance artist Miranda July. According to July, the video alludes to the band's friends. For example, the field where most of the music video was filmed stands near the house of Kill Rock Stars labelmate and Unwound bassist Vern Rumsey. ==Critical reception== The Hot Rock received positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey said that The Hot Rock \\"isn't quite as immediately satisfying as its two brilliant predecessors, but it does reward those willing to spend time absorbing its nervy introspection and moodiness\\". Huey also praised the band's use of dynamic tempo changes within the album's songs. Wendy Mitchell, writing for CMJ New Music Monthly, felt that the band \\"has matured into the musical equivalent of a twentysomething; still holding on to the energy of its youth, but exploring new options\\". The A.V. Club writer Stephen Thompson opined that The Hot Rock \\"lacks the blaze-of-glory freshness of its justly acclaimed predecessors, [...] but [the album] works just fine on its own as a terrific, explosive, and fun rock record\\". Rolling Stone editor Rob Sheffield opined that the album's \\"expansive new sound gives Sleater-Kinney room to experiment with their Husker Du-style storytelling\\" and felt that the band had grown as songwriters. He cited the song \\"The Size of Our Love\\" as the highlight of the album, commenting: \\"No other band could have made this song hit home—not even Sleater-Kinney, until now. They've earned the right to keep reinventing themselves\\". Writing for The Village Voice, Sara Sherr gave high marks to Tucker's vibrato, describing it as \\"a human teardrop [...] The one that hits you and feels like a kiss\\", while Robert Christgau praised the vocal interplay between Tucker and Brownstein, stating that the band \\"emerges as a diary of adulthood in all its encroaching intricacy\\". In a very positive review, Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly highlighted the depth of the group's interplay, commenting that \\"Tucker explores what her voice can do when it's not in overdrive, stretching vowels like a religious supplicant or spewing prosody like Patti Smith. At the same time, Brownstein blossoms as a singer herself [...] braiding lines with Tucker so artfully the result sounds like the voicings of a single restless mind\\". He considered The Hot Rock as Sleater- Kinney's \\"most finely turned record\\" and that its music \\"never falters\\". Peter Tarizan of Out magazine credited the work of the producer for polishing the band's sound without losing its intensity or muscle. The album appeared at number 23 in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1999. Similarly, Spin placed The Hot Rock at number 18 in its list of \\"The Top 20 Albums of 1999\\". In 2002, Rolling Stone ranked the album at number 17 on its list of \\"Women in Rock: The 50 Essential Albums\\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes. ;Sleater-Kinney *Carrie Brownstein – guitar, vocals *Corin Tucker – vocals, guitar *Janet Weiss – drums, percussion ;Additional musicians *Seth Warren – violin on \\"The Size of Our Love\\" and \\"Memorize Your Lines\\" *Roger Moutenot – slide guitar on \\"A Quarter to Three\\" ;Technical personnel *Roger Moutenot – production *Kip Beelman – engineering *Greg Calbi – mastering ==References== ==External links== * Category:1999 albums Category:Albums produced by Roger Moutenot Category:Sleater-Kinney albums Category:Kill Rock Stars albums Category:Matador Records albums Category:Sub Pop albums ","title":"The Hot Rock (album)"},{"id":"3230408","text":"Gunner Bay is a large bay in the far north of Bermuda.

The album features no bass player. As Tucker explained, \\"We started writing songs with two guitars, and we liked the way it sounded. It gives us a lot of freedom to write these lines that go back and forth.\\" The album is occasionally considered to be Sleater-Kinney's first proper album because Tucker and co-vocalist and guitarist Carrie Brownstein had left their previous bands, Heavens to Betsy and Excuse 17, at the time of its recording. Call the Doctor was produced by John Goodmanson and released on March 25, 1996, by the queercore independent record label Chainsaw Records, which also released the band's previous album, Sleater-Kinney. Drummer Laura MacFarlane, who was based in Australia, had to leave the band shortly after the album's release when her visa ran out. As a result, the band asked Toni Gogin of CeBe Barnes to fill in on the drums while touring the album. As of March 1997, the album has sold 6,000 copies. As of February 2015, Call the Doctor has sold 60,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan. ==Critical reception== Call the Doctor received acclaim from music journalists. Charles Taylor of The Boston Phoenix compared the album favorably to Heavens to Betsy's Calculated, stating that Call the Doctor \\"is in no way a mellowed piece of work. What makes it the fullest, most mature album any riot grrrl performer has produced isn't Tucker abandoning her anger (the idea that anger is incompatible with maturity is a facile one), but rather Tucker starting (reluctantly) to register the contingencies and compromises that her ideologically based rage is inadequate to confront\\". Similarly, prominent music critic Robert Christgau praised the album's raucous energy, commenting: \\"Powered by riffs that seem unstoppable even though they're not very fast, riding melodies whose irresistibility renders them barely less harsh, Corin Tucker's enormous voice never struggles more inspirationally against the world outside than when it's facing down the dilemmas of the interpersonal—dilemmas neither eased nor defined by her gender preferences, dilemmas as bound up with family as they are with sex.\\" AllMusic reviewer Jason Ankeny commented: \\"Forget the riot grrrl implications inherent in the trio's music — Call the Doctor is pure, undiluted punk, and it's brilliant\\". Johnny Huston, writing for Spin, remarked that Call the Doctor \\"trades sex-worker role-playing, doll parts, gender-bending, and other common female-rock tropes for stories of everyday struggle [...] Sleater-Kinney proves that punk still offers new ways to say no\\". The album appeared at number three in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1996. In 2010, Call the Doctor was ranked number 49 in the list of the 100 greatest albums of the nineties by the editors of Rolling Stone. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits are adapted from Call the Doctors album notes. * Corin Tucker – vocals, guitar, drums (on \\"Heart Attack\\") * Carrie Brownstein – guitar, vocals (on \\"Call the Doctor\\", \\"Stay Where You Are\\", \\"I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone\\" and \\"Heart Attack\\") * Lora Macfarlane – drums, vocals (on \\"Hubcap\\", \\"Stay Where You Are\\", \\"Taste Test\\"), guitar (on \\"Heart Attack\\") * John Goodmanson – producer Macfarlane was incorrectly credited with vocals on \\"Taking Me Home\\" (she actually sang on \\"Taste Test\\") ==References== ==External links== * Category:1996 albums Category:Albums produced by John Goodmanson Category:Sleater-Kinney albums Category:Matador Records albums Category:Sub Pop albums ","title":"Call the Doctor"},{"id":"3230433","text":"Juvenile Bermuda cedar at Ferry Reach. Ferry Reach is a three mile (five kilometre) long channel in the north-east of Bermuda, which lies between St. George's Island in the north and St. David's Island in the south south-west of the town of St. George's. It extends south from St. George's Harbour, Bermuda, linking it with Castle Harbour, and is crossed by two bridges at its northern end. The name also applies to the western end of St. George's Island which lies to the north of this channel, and, more loosely, to the water passage between the western tip (Ferry Point) of this and Coney Island. Three forts had been sited on Ferry point, the most recent being the Martello Tower built, along with a nearby magazine, under the command of Major Thomas Blanshard, RE, in the 1820s. A barracks was built near Ferry Point during the American War of Independence to house a detachment of the Royal Garrison Battalion. The building later became the Ferry Keeper's Cottage (it is still known by this name, although the ferry fell out of use after the Royal Engineers completed the nearby causeway in 1871. The War Department purchased the western of Ferry Reach in 1846, but the main route from St. George's to the rest of Bermuda remained via the Ferry Road and Ferry Point until the completion of the causeway. The area was used for housing part of the military garrison, primarily under canvas, as a way to minimise the effects of yellow fever, which struck hard in the closely packed barracks. The area was also used for quarantining those infected with yellow fever. The land area contains two British military cemeteriesThe Bermuda National Trust dating from the yellow fever epidemic of the 1860s. One of them, overlooking the North Shore to the east of Whalebone Bay, is a walled yard containing the graves of soldiers of the 2nd Battalion of the Queen's Royal (West Surrey) Regiment, and of one Royal Engineer, Sapper Aaron Boyes, who died during the epidemic. Most of the area is, today, a public parkland, but is still used frequently for military training by the Bermuda Regiment. The area is also the site of the only receiving station and storage facility for petroleum fuels delivered to Bermuda, with both Esso and Shell Petroleum maintaining large storage facilities with tanks that are fed from tankers moored well off-shore. The adjacent facilities, known popularly as the Oil Docks, lie on the North Shore, immediately to the east of the public park. Since 2006 the area has been undergoing development for warehouse space freeing up older buildings in developed areas for higher commercial use. ==Gallery== Image:Military Map- Ferry Reach-Bermuda.JPGMap of Ferry Reach before the area to its south was radically altered in 1941 by the construction of an airfield.

Carter (born January 1, 1985) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre and alternate captain of the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL). During his NHL career, he has won the Stanley Cup in 2012 and 2014, has appeared in two All-Star Games in 2009 and 2017, and led the Philadelphia Flyers – for whom he played six seasons – in scoring during their 2008–09 campaign; his 46 goals during that season were good for second overall in the NHL. Carter also played 39 games with the Columbus Blue Jackets during the 2011–12 season before being traded to Los Angeles. Carter played junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey League. He was a First Team All-Star, William Hanley Trophy and CHL Sportsman of the Year honours in his final year. Joining the Flyers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Philadelphia Phantoms, immediately after his junior career, he helped the team win the Calder Cup in 2005. Internationally, Carter has won gold medals with Team Canada at the under-18, under-20 levels and at the Olympics. During his under-20 career, he tied as Canada's all-time leading scorer at the World Juniors and was named to back-to-back Tournament All-Star Teams. He has also represented Canada at the 2006 IIHF World Championship. Carter represented Canada at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, where he won a gold medal. ==Playing career== ===Early career=== Carter played minor hockey in London, Ontario, with the London Jr. Knights rep program. He then played bantam hockey with the AAA Elgin-Middlesex Chiefs of the Ontario Minor Hockey Association (OMHA) before spending a season with the Strathroy Rockets, a Junior B team. Carter was selected in the first round, 3rd overall, of the 2001 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection by the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. He began his OHL career in 2001–02, recording 35 points over 63 games as a rookie. The following season, he improved to 71 points. In the off-season, the Philadelphia Flyers selected him 11th overall in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. Carter with the Phantoms during the 2005 Calder Cup Finals Returning to the Greyhounds following his draft, he earned Second Team OHL All-Star honours in 2003–04 with a 66-point campaign. Following his third OHL season, he was assigned by the Flyers to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Philadelphia Phantoms, for their 2005 Calder Cup playoff season. He recorded five points over 12 games in his initial stint at the professional level. Back in the OHL for his final junior season in 2004–05, he recorded a major junior career-high 74 points (34 goals and 40 assists) in 55 games. He was a First Team OHL All-Star that season and won the OHL and CHL Sportsman of the Year Awards. After the Greyhounds were eliminated from the 2005 OHL playoffs, Carter joined the Phantoms once more and recorded 23 points (12 goals and 11 assists) in 21 playoff games, helping the team win the Calder Cup. ===Philadelphia Flyers=== The next season, in 2005–06, Carter made the Flyers' roster out of training camp. He was joined by fellow rookies Mike Richards and R. J. Umberger, who were both also instrumental in the Phantoms' Calder Cup championship of the previous season. He scored his first career NHL goal on October 27, 2005, against Roberto Luongo of the Florida Panthers. He finished the campaign first in team-scoring among rookies with 23 goals and 42 points. Carter with the Flyers in September 2010 After 37- and 53-point efforts in his second and third NHL seasons, respectively, Carter and the Flyers agreed to a three-year, $15-million contract extension on June 27, 2008, days before he was set to become a restricted free agent. He responded with a breakout campaign in 2008–09, leading the team in scoring with 46 goals and 84 points. During the season, he was also named to his first NHL All-Star Game, representing the Eastern Conference. Despite a strong regular season, Carter was held to just one goal in six Stanley Cup playoff games as the Flyers were eliminated by the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games. His series was also marred when he failed to score with an open net in front of him in Game 2 of the series, where Penguins goalie Marc-André Fleury made a toe save to block the shot that would have given the Flyers a 3–1 lead late in the third period. Carter was later called off for a hooking penalty and the Penguins scored to tie the game and eventually win in overtime. It was later revealed that Carter had played the final four games of the series with a separated shoulder. On November 13, 2010, Carter signed an 11-year, $58 million contract extension with the Flyers through to the 2021–22 season. ===Columbus Blue Jackets=== While in the midst of a major re-tooling, the Flyers traded Carter to the Columbus Blue Jackets on June 23, 2011, in exchange for Jakub Voráček, a 2011 first-round pick (Sean Couturier) and a 2011 third-round pick (Nick Cousins). Despite being injured in the start of the season, Carter was named an alternate captain with the Blue Jackets, one of four rotating alternates along with James Wisniewski, former Flyers teammate R. J. Umberger and Antoine Vermette. ===Los Angeles Kings=== Carter (foreground) with the Kings in February 2019 On February 23, 2012, Carter was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Jack Johnson and a conditional first-round pick, reuniting him with former Flyer and close friend Mike Richards. On June 11, 2012, Carter scored the second of three unanswered goals on a five-minute power play in Game 6 of the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals against the New Jersey Devils. His goal proved to be the Cup-winning goal. He would finish the 2012 playoffs with eight goals and five assists. During the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, Carter scored 26 goals along with seven assists, playing in all 48 regular season games. In the first round of the 2014 playoffs, the Kings rallied back from a 3–0 series deficit against the San Jose Sharks to win four-straight and take the series in seven games. This made Carter one of the first and only two players (the other being his teammate Mike Richards) in history to be a part of two teams who achieved such a feat (Philadelphia Flyers in 2010, Los Angeles Kings in 2014; though Carter missed the Flyers' series in 2010 due to injury). When the Kings beat the New York Rangers in 5 games in the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals, Carter and Drew Doughty became the seventh and eighth NHL players to win both an Olympic hockey gold medal and the Stanley Cup in the same year. Early in the 2014–15 season, Carter was named the NHL's First Star of the Week for October 20–26 after scoring two goals and four assists in just two games. This helped the reigning Stanley Cup champion Kings maintain a perfect 6–0 record during their season-opening homestand. On February 15, 2015, Carter passed the 500 career NHL point mark with a three-assist performance against the Calgary Flames in a 5–3 victory for the Kings. Carter played a majority of the season with Tanner Pearson and Tyler Toffoli, with the line being dubbed \\"That '70s Line\\" since all three had jersey numbers in the 70s. (Pearson #70, Carter #77, Toffoli #73) ==International play== Carter debuted internationally with Team Canada with the under-18 team at the 2003 IIHF World U18 Championships. He scored six points in seven games, helping Canada to their first-ever gold medal at the tournament. The following year, Carter moved on to the Canadian national under-20 team, playing in back-to-back World Junior Championships. Winning silver in 2004 and gold in 2005, he was named to the tournament's All-Star Team in both instances. His combined 12 goals over both years tied him with Eric Lindros (later also tied by John Tavares) for Canada's all-time record at the World Juniors. Lindros had played in three tournaments between 1990 and 1992 (one more than both Carter and Tavares). Carter had been joined on the World Junior squads by two future Philadelphia Flyers teammates, Mike Richards and Braydon Coburn. Following his rookie NHL season, Carter played for the Canadian men's team at the 2006 World Championships. He recorded six points in nine games as Canada failed to qualify for a medal. He was also selected as a reserve by Team Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics should an injury occur. Carter then played for Canada at the 2014 Winter Olympics, where he scored a natural hat-trick against Austria, and eventually took home gold after helping defeat Sweden in the final. ==Personal life== Carter owns a house in Sea Isle City, New Jersey, which he bought when he was a member of the Philadelphia Flyers. He spends time there during the NHL off-season. In June 2014, days after winning his second Stanley Cup with the Los Angeles Kings, Carter became engaged to longtime girlfriend Megan. They married on July 7, 2014. On November 1, 2016 their son Caden Jeffrey Carter was born. On November 12, 2017, their daughter Emersyn Elizabeth Carter was born. Carter is good friends with Mike Richards, his teammate from his tenure with the Flyers and the Kings. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em;\\" - e0e0e0;\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - e0e0e0;\\" !

Schulz. It originally aired on the ABC network on August 29, 2003. It was released on DVD on March 2, 2004, and again on May 1, 2012, as part of a single disc called Happiness is...Peanuts: Team Snoopy.Happiness is... Peanuts(TM): Team Snoopy DVD - Warner Bros.: WBshop.com - The Official Online Store of Warner Bros. Studios ==Plot== It's the beginning of baseball season, and Charlie Brown is looking forward to the new season with a mixture of joy and apprehension. The apprehension is mainly due to Lucy, who is constantly bothering him with idiotic questions, sarcastic remarks and non-sequiturs, to the point where poor Charlie literally becomes physically ill on the pitcher's mound. After his team loses their first game to Peppermint Patty's team, Charlie Brown then thinks of a great idea of trading one of his team players to Peppermint Patty. He decides to trade Snoopy for five of Peppermint Patty's players (because Snoopy is the only player Patty would want). However, the team is angry with Charlie Brown for this, and Charlie Brown finally decides to rip up the contract made for the trade (which is just as well, as the five players Patty was going to trade declared they'd give up baseball before they'd ever play for Charlie Brown). The team continues to play throughout the season normally until Peppermint Patty suggests that they should trade Lucy for one of Peppermint Patty's team members, which Charlie Brown does. Peppermint Patty gets Lucy, while Charlie Brown gets Marcie (and a pizza). Marcie, however, chooses to not play at her position but spend the entire game next to Charlie Brown on the pitcher's mound. Meanwhile, Lucy, over on Peppermint Patty's squad, gets into her usual fuss-budget business by failing Peppermint Patty at every game the team plays by doing something stupid. Peppermint Patty finally has enough and asks Charlie Brown for the trade to be reversed, which Charlie Brown agrees to do, though he does admit to Peppermint Patty that he had already eaten the pizza included in the trade. At the end, everyone but Charlie Brown leaves due to rain. Charlie Brown stays on the pitcher's mound as the credits roll, only leaving the field when the credits end. ==Source material== The storyline involving Snoopy's botched trade to Peppermint Patty's team was based on a lengthy Peanuts storyline from the fall of 1967. The storyline involving Lucy's and Marcie's trades originated in a storyline from 1988. Of note is the fact that Peppermint Patty refers to Snoopy as \\"the little kid with the big nose,\\" which is in line with the content of Peanuts in 1967 when the original strips were drawn. In the actual strip, Peppermint Patty did not learn Snoopy was a dog until 1974 and never referred to him as a \\"kid with the big nose\\" afterwards. ==Voice cast== *Serena Berman as Lucy van Pelt *Wesley Singerman as Charlie Brown *Corey Padnos as Linus van Pelt *Daniel Hansen as Peppermint Patty *Melissa Montoya as Marcie *Megan Taylor Harvey as Sally Brown *Christopher Ryan Johnson as Schroeder *Bill Meléndez as Snoopy and Woodstock Frieda and Pig-Pen also appear, but are silent. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Peanuts television specials Category:Television programs directed by Bill Melendez Category:American Broadcasting Company television specials Category:2003 television specials Category:2000s American television specials Category:Baseball animation Category:American baseball films ","title":"Lucy Must Be Traded, Charlie Brown"},{"id":"3230484","text":"The Recreational Trails Program (RTP) is a federal assistance program of the United States Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). It provides funds to the States to develop and maintain recreational trails and trail-related facilities for both nonmotorized and motorized recreational trail uses. The RTP funds come from the Federal Highway Trust Fund, and represent a portion of the motor fuel excise tax collected from nonhighway recreational fuel use: fuel used for off-highway recreation by snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, off-highway motorcycles, and off-highway light trucks. The Congress authorized the RTP for $60 million in 2005, $70 million in 2006, $75 million in 2007, $80 million in 2008, and $85 million 2009. On July 6, 2012 a two-year surface transportation agreement, called MAP-21, was signed into law. The Recreational Trails Program is continued intact with funding set at $85 million a year for Fiscal Years 2013 and 2014. The RTP funds are distributed to the States by legislative formula: half of the funds are distributed equally among all States, and half are distributed in proportion to the estimated amount of nonhighway recreational fuel use in each State. Each State administers its own program, usually through a State resource or park agency. Each State develops its own procedures to solicit and select projects for funding. Recreational Trails Program funds may be used for: * Maintenance and restoration of existing trails. * Development and rehabilitation of trailside and trailhead facilities and trail linkages. * Purchase and lease of trail construction and maintenance equipment. * Construction of new trails (with restrictions for new trails on Federal lands). * Acquisition of easements or property for trails. * Assessment of trail conditions for accessibility and maintenance. Recreational Trails Program funds may not be used for: * Property condemnation (eminent domain) * Constructing new trails for motorized use on National Forest or Bureau of Land Management lands unless the project is consistent with resource management plans * Facilitating motorized access on otherwise nonmotorized trails. States must use 30% of their funds for motorized trail uses, 30% for nonmotorized trail uses, and 40% for diverse trail uses.

Castle Harbour (originally Southampton Harbour), was radically altered by the construction of an airfield in 1941, Kindley Field, by the US Army. St. David's Island is one of the main islands of the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda. It is located in the far north of the territory, one of the two similarly sized islands that make up the majority of St. George's Parish. The island was originally in size. During World War II, in 1942 it was enlarged by reclamation, and by absorbing Long Bird Island and Cooper's Island, to , in order to allow room for a United States military base (originally the US Army's Fort Bell/Kindley Field, operated jointly during the war with the British Royal Air Force). This was later renamed as Kindley Air Force Base and USNAS Bermuda, which occupied more than half the island's land under a 99-year lease. The base was closed in 1995 and returned to Bermuda. Those parts of the base required for operation of the airfield, along with the Civil air Terminal, became the Bermuda International Airport (subsequently renamed L.F. Wade International Airport by the PLP government). Cooper's Island is now attached physically to southeast St. David's, although the two islands are still widely regarded as if they were separate entities. St. David's Island, as it appears today. The island was named by British colonists in honour of Saint David, the patron saint of Wales, as the similarly sized St. George's Island, to the north, had been named for the patron saint of England. The two islands are separated by two bodies of water - Ferry Reach in the south-west and St. George's Harbor in the north-east. St. David's is separated from the Bermudian mainland by the waters of Castle Harbor in the south, but is joined to it by road via The Causeway. Notable features of the island include St. David's Head, Bermuda's easternmost point, and the nearby St. David's Battery, on Great Head (Great Head is the more prominent of two headlands that comprise St. David's Head); L.F. Wade International Airport; St. David's Lighthouse; and Annie's Bay on Cooper's Island. St. David's Island is connected to the United States by an Atlantic fiber optic cable known as 360 Americas. ==Demographics== As with the rest of Bermuda, the St. David's islanders were established from a diverse group of immigrants, beginning in the 17th century. These included indentured servants from England, Spanish-speaking Blacks from the West Indies, and Black African, Native American, Irish, and Scottish slaves. The last three groups were largely composed of prisoners-of-war and others who were deported by the English from their homelands in ethnic cleansing that followed wars of conquest. Although hundreds of Native American slaves were absorbed into the total population of Bermuda, some Bermudians have long referred to St. David's islanders (disparagingly) as 'Mohawks'. Only two Mohawk boys were recorded as having been imported to Bermuda following Dutch-Mohawk wars. To many English in the late 17th and 18th centuries, however, the Iroquoian-speaking Mohawk were the best-known Native American people, as they were a powerful tribe in eastern New York. Some English of the period referred to any Native American as a Mohawk. Today, many St. David's islanders are proud to be called Mohawks. They are actively re-establishing links to the Wampanoag, Pequot and other Algonquian nations that contributed the most members to Bermuda's early settlement. Since the joining of the Island to the rest of Bermuda by the US Army in the 1940s, the former relative isolation of St. David's has ended. The subsequent influx of other Bermudians to what is seen as a more affordable part of Bermuda to buy property, which increased dramatically after the closure of NAS Bermuda in 1995, has eroded the unique character of the islands population. They were once distinguishable by accent and appearance. ==Education== St. David's Preschool and Primary School are both on the island.Home. St. David's Preschool. Retrieved on September 14, 2016.

Located at the junction of Orchard Road and Scotts Road in Singapore, it features the flagship Lido Cineplex for the Shaw Organisation, a major shopping mall with Isetan as an anchor tenant, and two office buildings. ==Shaw House== Shaw House is a shopping mall and the home of Lido Cinema (now Lido 8 Cineplex). Lido Cinema was constructed in 1958 as a 10-storey office block, and was officially opened by Lim Yew Hock on 22 November 1958. In the late 1980s, owner Shaw Organisation decided to tear down the old Lido Cinema, and build a 21-storey building with a basement. This project, which was the Shaw Organisation's largest in Singapore to date, was completed in 1993 after three years of construction. Shaw House houses the main store of Isetan in Singapore, and occupies five floors. It has a Japanese supermarket in the basement, and has offices on the upper floors of the building. The building also houses the Lido Cineplex with 8 screens on Levels 5 and 6. At its opening in 1993, the cineplex started with only 5 halls, but was expanded with another 3 halls in 1997 to keep up with the demands of the cinema market. The main hall, Lido 1, has a capacity of over 900, which was renovated in 2004. It was the first hall in the country to be THX certified with SDDS, DTS, Dolby Digital and Dolby SR. The projection booth has the ability to \\"interlock\\" one print in more than one hall, to allow a blockbuster to be seen in several halls at one time. Although Lido 1 is no longer THX certified, it has equipped itself with Dolby Digital Surround.EX sound system, and is also a 2K DIGITAL hall. Lido 2 is also now a 2K DIGITAL hall capable of screening digital movies. Lido 3 is an E-cinema. In mid-2010, plans were made to add two more 3D theatres and one IMAX theatre. The Cineplex closed in late 2010 for renovations to add the new theatres. It reopened on 5 May 2011. The IMAX theatre officially opened on 19 May 2011 to screen its first film, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. ==Shaw Centre== Shaw Centre lies adjacent to Shaw House, and was the tallest building in Singapore when it was completed in 1972. The head office of Shaw & Shaw Pte Limited, the precursor of Shaw Organisation, moved into Shaw Centre in 1978. The building has 28 floors with five stories of shops, and eight floors of parking. Shaw Centre is connected to Shaw House and the two buildings share the same car park. It has a range of shops and restaurants, and is home to one of Singapore's most renowned restaurants, Les Amis. Shaw Centre once had an al fresco McDonald's restaurant located on the ground floor, along the sidewalk facing Scotts Road. It was refurbished in 1989 and most recently in 2013 with a new facade for the shopping mall levels.

He was drafted in the eighth round of the 2001 NHL Entry Draft (232nd overall) by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Mighty Ducks, Carolina Hurricanes, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Edmonton Oilers, winning the Stanley Cup as a member of the Hurricanes in 2006. Following the 2011–12 season, he played two seasons in the Swedish Elitserien before returning to the NLA, finishing his playing career with the Kloten Flyers. ==Playing career== Gerber began his career in his native Switzerland for SC Langnau. Initially playing in the Nationalliga B, Gerber and the Tigers won promotion to Nationalliga A in 1998. In 2001, he was drafted by the NHL's Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and spent the subsequent season in Sweden playing for Färjestads BK in the Elitserien. He moved to the Ducks organization in 2002 and on 11 October of that year, Gerber played his first NHL game, a 4–2 loss to the Dallas Stars. He went on to play 22 regular season games that season, serving as backup to Jean-Sébastien Giguère. That season, the Mighty Ducks made it to the Stanley Cup Finals, narrowly losing in seven games to the New Jersey Devils. Gerber continued his role as backup and played 32 games for Anaheim in 2003–04. On 18 June 2004, Gerber was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for Tomáš Malec and a third-round pick in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Gerber returned to his former European teams, playing 20 games with the SCL Tigers and 30 with Färjestad BK. Gerber returned to the NHL for the 2005–06 season, and it was a successful one for Gerber, who won 38 games and helped earn Carolina their third division championship. Gerber entered the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs as the Hurricanes' starting goaltender, but he struggled in the team's opening series and was replaced by rookie Cam Ward, who had been his backup for most of the season. Ward went on to backstop the team to its first Stanley Cup championship as the Hurricanes defeated the Edmonton Oilers in seven games in the Finals. Gerber, who earned 1 of Carolina's 16 playoff wins, became the second Swiss player in NHL history to win a Stanley Cup; David Aebischer, also a goaltender, was the first in 2001 with the Colorado Avalanche. On 1 July 2006, as a free agent, Gerber signed a contract with the Ottawa Senators. However, he struggled throughout the season and was replaced as starting goaltender by Ray Emery. That season, Emery led the Senators to their first appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals, where they would lose to Gerber's former team, the Anaheim Ducks. It was Gerber's third appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals in five years. Gerber began the 2007–08 season as the Senators' starter when Emery was sidelined after off-season wrist surgery. His play was inconsistent and Emery resumed the starting job once he was healthy again. However, after the team suffered a rapid decline in the standings and head coach John Paddock was fired and replaced by general manager Bryan Murray, Murray declared Gerber as the starting goaltender for the remainder of the season. Gerber entered the 2008–09 season in that role, but his uneven play continued and he was eventually supplanted by the newly signed Alex Auld. On 22 January 2009, Gerber was placed on waivers after having been sent down to the Senators' then-American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Binghamton Senators. Gerber sporting his all-black \\"Darth Gerber\\" mask with the Senators. On 4 March 2009, Gerber was claimed off waivers by the Toronto Maple Leafs to replace goaltender Vesa Toskala, who was scheduled for season-ending surgery. During a game on 24 March against the Washington Capitals, Gerber was assessed a game-misconduct and immediately suspended for three games for an incident with the on-ice officials, during which Gerber was arguing a call and proceeded to make contact with referee Mike Leggo and a linesman who was attempting to restrain him. During the off- season, Gerber signed a contract with Atlant Moscow Oblast of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), coincidentally the same team that fellow former Senators goaltender Ray Emery played for the previous season before returning to the NHL in 2009. On 13 December 2009, while playing for Atlant, Gerber suffered an apparent fracture of the fourth vertebrae when an opposing forward slid into him. Gerber's neck injury was initially thought to be a compression fracture of a cervical vertebra and it was believed that he would miss upwards of six months. However, after more comprehensive testing the following day, no fractures were found and it was diagnosed as a spinal contusion; he would only be sidelined for a few weeks. On 6 August 2010, Gerber signed a one-year contract with the Edmonton Oilers. He was assigned to the team's AHL affiliate, the Oklahoma City Barons. He was recalled on 18 November after Oilers' goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin was placed on injured reserve. Gerber made his first start for the Oilers on 25 November, recording a 3–2 victory over the visiting Colorado Avalanche. He stopped 35 of 37 shots and drew an assist on the game-winning goal scored by Taylor Hall. Gerber started one more game, a 4–1 victory at Ottawa, before Khabibulin was re-activated and Gerber was returned to the Barons. Gerber was again re-called in late February after another injury to Khabibulin. Picking up where he left off in late November, Gerber stopped 34 shots in a 2–1 shootout win over the Nashville Predators on 1 March, improving to a 3–0 record with Edmonton. On 12 July 2011, Gerber signed a one-year contract with Växjö Lakers of the Swedish Elitserien. Playing 42 games, he finished the 2011–12 season ranked fifth in the save percentage with .928 and seventh in goals against average (GAA) with 2.18, although Växjö failed to qualify for the playoffs. For the 2012–13 season, he signed with fellow Elitserien club Rögle BK. After one season with Rögle, Gerber returned to Switzerland in signing a two-year contract with Kloten Flyers. He retired from professional hockey after his contract with Kloten expired. ===Goaltender mask=== To start the 2007–08 season, Gerber wore an all-black mask while his other mask was being painted; he played so well wearing the black mask that he decided not to replace it, wearing it for the remainder of the season. Fans endearingly called him \\"Darth Gerber\\". In response, Gerber tried out a new Darth Vader-inspired mask design to begin the 2008–09 season when he was with the Ottawa Senators. The mask was worn by Gerber during his first few games with Toronto before he switched to a new one paying homage to old masks of past Maple Leafs' goaltenders. ==International play== During his playing career, Gerber was a mainstay on the Switzerland national team, having represented his country in eight IIHF World Championships and two Winter Olympics since 2000. At the 2006 Winter Olympics, Gerber made 49 saves to shut-out a heavily-favoured Canada 2–0 in one of the biggest upsets in modern Olympic hockey history regarded as one of the greatest accomplishments in Swiss hockey. Gerber has appeared in 40 games at the World Championships. Switzerland failed to medal in any of these tournaments, their highest finish being fifth in 2010, though their play has seen their IIHF World Rank increase from ninth in 2003 to seventh in 2010. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"width:90%; text-align:center;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"10\\" bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"8\\" bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

Nonis (born May 25, 1966) is a Canadian former ice hockey defenceman. He is a special assignment scout for the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League (NHL) and serves as a consultant to the team's general manager, Bob Murray. ==Playing career== Growing up in Burnaby, B.C., Nonis played junior hockey with the Burnaby Bluehawks of the BCJHL in 1982–83. He then began collegiate hockey in the NCAA at the University of Maine, playing 153 games from 1984 through 1988. Nonis spent his final two years for the Bears as team captain, leading Maine to back-to-back NCAA championship tournaments. After completing his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1988, Nonis played a year of professional hockey for Aalborg (AaB) in the Danish Hockey League. In 1989, he returned to the University of Maine as an assistant coach for one season. ==Executive career== Nonis replaced Brian Burke as the Vancouver Canucks' general manager in 2004. At 37 years old, he was the youngest general manager in team history. Prior to being GM for the Canucks, he spent six years working closely with Burke as senior vice-president and director of hockey operations for the franchise. In three seasons as general manager, his most significant transaction was trading for superstar goaltender Roberto Luongo from the Florida Panthers at the conclusion of his first season as GM. Upon the completion of the 2007–08 season, the Canucks missed the playoffs for the second time in three seasons; subsequently, on April 14, 2008, Nonis was relieved of his duties as general manager of the Canucks. Two months later, on June 21, 2008, Nonis was hired as senior advisor of hockey operations for the Anaheim Ducks, reuniting with longtime boss Brian Burke, who had been General Manager of the Ducks since 2005. On December 4, 2008, Nonis accepted the position of senior vice-president and director of hockey operations of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Nonis accepted the post and it marked the third time he served under Brian Burke. On May 10, 2010 he signed an extension to keep his position through the 2011-12 season. On January 9, 2013, Nonis was named general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs after Burke was relieved of his duties.Toronto Maple Leafs have fired Brian Burke. Toronto Sun, January 9, 2013. Under Nonis, the Maple Leafs made the 2013 playoffs for the first time since 2004. However, after two disappointing seasons, Nonis was relieved of his duties on April 12, 2015, one day after the 2014-15 regular season ended, along with head coach Peter Horachek, assistant coaches Steve Spott and Chris Denis, and goaltending coach Rick St. Croix. On July 3, 2015, the Anaheim Ducks announced they had hired Nonis as a special assignment scout and a consultant to the team's general manager, Bob Murray. ==Family== David is married to Susan, with whom he has one son, Nicholas.

Dopamine can be metabolized into one of three substances. One such substance is DOPAC. Another is 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT). Both of these substances are degraded to form homovanillic acid (HVA). Both degradations involve the enzymes monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), albeit in reverse order: MAO catalyzes dopamine to DOPAC, and COMT catalyzes DOPAC to HVA; whereas COMT catalyzes dopamine to 3-MT and MAO catalyzes 3-MT to HVA. The third metabolic end-product of dopamine is norepinephrine (noradrenaline). DOPAC can be oxidized by hydrogen peroxide, leading to the formation of toxic metabolites which destroy dopamine storage vesicles in the substantia nigra. This may contribute to the failure of levodopa treatment of Parkinson's disease. A MAO-B inhibitor such as selegiline or rasagiline can prevent this from happening.

This question arises in classical political economy, where John Stuart Mill argues that money is unimportant, and that while money might disguise the true values in an economy, it would only do so for a limited period of time. This was used to argue against government intervention in political economy as a waste of time. The problem expanded, however, as money swung back toward credit-based issuance of notes. What money meant, or was equivalent to, became important as governments attempted to adjust interest rates rather than maintain the gold standard. In the 20th century the veil of money was used to describe questions of stability and the exchangeability of money for interest or commodity in a macroeconomic model. In essence, as long as money can be treated like a commodity, there is no stickiness between money and goods, or money and interest. The veil of money and, as a related issue, the quantity theory of money have special importance in economic theory throughout the 20th century. Actually, 20th century economics can be interpreted as a sequence of theoretical answers to the question whether money is only a veil or not. Different theories can be judged by their implied ideas as to the neutrality of money. In the simplest models and in the simplest form of the quantity theory of money, money is completely neutral, that is, changes in the money supply do not affect anything real. However, in the more elaborated models the neutrality theorem was applied rather to long-run considerations. For both Milton Friedman and Robert E. Lucas money was not a mere veil in the short run, so money was assumed to have real effects in the short run. The mechanisms through which money could exert these real effects were radically different and so were the sets of assumptions these authors created to establish their models. For example, Friedman postulated adaptive expectations, while Lucas assumed his economic agents to be able to form rational expectations. For both of them, money was only neutral in the long-run – that is, money was not just a veil in the short-run – but the scope of countercyclical economic policy was radically curtailed in new classical macroeconomics. In the case of rational expectations the monetary authority is not able to carry out systematic countercyclical economic policy – that is, it cannot exploit the existing short-run Phillips curve. However, it can be realized that if any of the conditions necessary to the ineffectiveness of systematic economic policy is not met, economic policy can be effective again, so, money is not only a veil. ==See also== *Money illusion *Neutrality of money *Real versus nominal value ==References== Category:Monetary economics ","title":"Veil of money"},{"id":"3230615","text":"The Haberman Educational Foundation is a not-for-profit foundation chartered in 1994 in accordance with the research of Martin Haberman for selecting the best teachers and principals for the children and youth of America.

It was the first major book by the author, and together with Bay Ganyo they are considered to be his most notable works. A lot of the book is written in a humorous, satirical tone, with occasional more sober reflections. Konstantinov had previous experience with travel abroad - he had visited the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889 and the General Land Centennial Exhibition in Prague in 1891. At the time, Bulgaria had left the Ottoman Empire less than 20 years ago, the country was still less developed than Western Europe and relatively few Bulgarians had had the chance to travel abroad. The book starts in Paris, with the author and the group of friends who accompany him on the journey taking a train to the port of Le Havre, where they board SS La Touraine to cross the Atlantic on board. On arriving in New York, he describes being underwhelmed by spotting the Statue of Liberty from the steamship. A customs clerk fails to understand the group's nationality, and when Bulgaria is pointed out to him on a map, he writes it down as Turkey, causing amusement and derision among the Bulgarians. They found accommodation in Broadway Central Hotel. Most of the book describes his stay in the United States, especially Chicago but also talks about other sites such as Niagara Falls, among others. == Legacy == The title page of the book's first edition is depicted on the obverse of the Bulgarian 100 levs banknote, issued in 2003.Bulgarian National Bank.

It is either 7-bit encoding or 8-bit encoding, although 8-bit encoding is dominant for modern use. The full name of this standard is 7-bit and 8-bit coded character sets for information interchange (). The first 96 codes comprise an ISO 646 variant, mostly following ASCII with some differences, while the second 96 character codes represent the phonetic Japanese katakana signs. Since the encoding does not provide any way to express hiragana or kanji, it is only capable of expressing simplified written Japanese. Nevertheless, it is possible to express, at least phonetically, the full range of sounds in the language. In the 1980s, this was acceptable for media such as text mode computer terminals, telegrams, receipts or other electronically handled data. JIS X 0201 was supplanted by subsequent encodings such as Shift JIS (which combines this standard and JIS X 0208) and later Unicode. ==History== The Comite Consultatif International Telephonique et Telegraphique (CCITT) introduced the International Telegraph Alphabet No.2 (ITA2) code as an international standard, which was the 5-bit Latin encoding. Most countries have their own national standards based on this. In Japan, the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) standardized it as the 6-bit character codes of JIS C 0803-1961 (Keyboard layout and codes for teleprinters), which combined with katakana characters. However, it didn't match the industry requirements because the character map was small, and the code layout was impractical. The AIST considered a practical character encoding to replace various codes used in Japan. In 1963, ISO introduced a draft of ISO R 646 (6 and 7-bit coded character sets for information processing interchange). AIST committed the conjunction of ISO R 646 and katakana mapping to the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ). IPSJ formed the code standardization committee. The committee didn't adopt the 6-bit form of ISO's draft because the katakana set couldn't fit into its character map. The early JIS draft mapped small katakana characters next to each of their normal katakana characters. It was considered to be convenient for sorting by Gojūon order. Some committee members criticized it would complicate the mechanic of keyboards which only handled normal katakana characters. The later draft mapped small katakana characters to positions 0xA7-0xAF. In 1966, the fourth draft of ISO specified the national currency symbol at 0x24, and the JIS committee planned to map the yen sign. The first edition of ISO 646 was published in 1967. It specified the ASCII's dollar sign 0x24 as the invariant character, so the JIS committee decided to replace the ASCII's backslash 0x5c (one of variant characters) with the yen sign. However, CCITT introduced the International Alphabet No.5 (IA5) in 1968, which stated that there was no requirement for the dollar sign and it could be replaced with the international currency sign (¤). ISO 646 was revised in 1973 to conform with IA5. JIS C 6220 (Codes for information interchange, 情報交換用符号) was published in 1969. Its number was changed to JIS X 0201 due to the JIS category reform in 1987, and the name was changed to 7-bit and 8-bit coded character sets for information interchange (7ビット及び8ビットの情報交換用符号化文字集合) in the 1990 edition. The character set of JIS X 0201 had been widely used in Japan. The Nationwide Banking Data Communication System (全国銀行データ通信システム), the largest funds transfer system in Japan, was established in 1973. Transaction messages between banks used a subset of JIS X 0201. The system had been used until 2018, and it was replaced by the ZEDI (The Nationwide Banking Electronic Data Interchange System, 全銀EDIシステム) which could handle hiragana and kanji characters. In 1978, JIS C 6226 (JIS X 0208) 2-byte character set was developed to express hiragana and kanji characters. It includes katakana characters, but their codes and layout are different from JIS X 0201. Computer manufacturers developed their own extensions of JIS X 0208 to retain compatibility with JIS X 0201. In 1982, the Microsoft Kanji encoding scheme (Codepage 932 of MS-DOS) and Digital Research's SJC26 (for Japanese CP/M-86) were developed to combine JIS X 0201 single-byte encoding and JIS X 0208 double byte encoding without shift out and shift in characters. They were called Shift JIS, which became the industrial standard for personal computers. ==Implementation details== 7-bit Roman (shift in) set 7-bit Kana (shift out) set The first half (Roman set) of JIS X 0201 constitutes a Japanese variant of ISO 646, amounting to ASCII with backslash (\\\\\\\\) and tilde (~) replaced by yen (¥) and overline (‾), while the second half (Kana set) consists mainly of katakana. Control characters are specified in JIS X 0211. In the 7-bit format, the shift out control character (0x0E) switches to the Kana set and shift in (0x0F) switches to the Roman set. In the 8-bit format, given in the chart below, bytes with the most significant bit set (i.e. 0x80-0xFF) are used for the Kana set and bytes with it unset (i.e. 0x00-0x7F) are used otherwise. Names used specifically for the 7-bit Roman set include \\"JISCII\\", \\"JIS Roman\\", \\"ISO646-JP\\", \\"JIS C6220-1969-ro\\", \\"Japanese-Roman\\", \\"Japan 7-Bit Latin\\", and \\"ISO-IR-14\\", whereas names used specifically for the 7-bit Kana set include \\"ISO-IR-13\\", \\"JIS C6220-1969-jp\\" and \\"x0201-7\\". The substitution of the yen symbol for backslash can make paths on DOS and Windows-based computers with Japanese support display strangely, like \\"C:¥Program Files¥\\", for example. Another similar problem is C programming language's control characters of string literals, like \`printf(\\"Hello, world.¥n\\");\`. ==Codepage layout== The following table is the original 8-bit coded character set of JIS X 0201 (with the kana set indicated by bytes with the high bit set). { - !  colspan=\\"16\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  - ! - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !  colspan=\\"16\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  - ! - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } ===As part of Shift JIS=== Following is the mapping used for JIS X 0201 as part of Shift_JIS, i.e. showing the 8-bit form of JIS X 0201, and mapping the Katakana characters to the Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms block (which in turn derives its half width kana layout from JIS X 0201). { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !  style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background- color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" - ! style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - ! style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" - ! style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\" style=\\"background-color: #fbb;\\"    } Red cells indicate first bytes of double-byte Shift JIS characters. === Alternative mapping of katakana === The basic ISO-2022-JP profile does not permit the Kana set of JIS X 0201, only the Roman set and JIS X 0208 (although ISO 2022 / JIS X 0202 itself permits it). Accordingly, when converting JIS X 0201 katakana (or Unicode half-width kana, which use the same layout) to ISO-2022-JP, the following mapping or transformation is often used. This allows the kana to be converted to JIS X 0208. In theory, this mapping is equally correct, as JIS X 0201 itself does not specify display width, although in practice (and especially in duospaced environments) JIS X 0201 is used for half-width katakana. For ease of comparison with the chart above, the mapping is shown below over the JIS X 0201 katakana encoding and with the high bit set. { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - } ==Variants and extensions== ===Shift JIS=== ===IBM's implementations=== Code page 897 is IBM's implementation of the 8-bit form of JIS X 0201. It includes several additional graphical characters in the C0 control characters area, and the code points in question may be used as control characters or graphical characters depending on the context, similarly in concept to OEM-US, but with different graphical characters. The C0 rows are shown below. { - !                 - !                 } IBM also implements the 7-bit Roman set of JIS X 0201 as Code page 895 and the 7-bit Kana set as Code page 896 for use as ISO 2022 or EUC-JP code-sets. Code page 896, in addition to standard JIS X 0201 assignments, defines five additional assignments, shown below. Although use of these extended characters is not permitted by the associated CCSID 896, they are permitted by the alternative CCSID 4992. { - !                 } IBM's Code page 1041 is an extended version of Code page 897, encoding these five IBM extended characters in alternative locations which are compatible with Shift JIS (respectively 0x80, 0xA0, 0xFD, 0xFE and 0xFF). IBM's Code page 903 is encoded for use as the single byte component of certain simplified Chinese character encodings. Despite this, it follows ISO 646-JP / the Roman half of JIS X 0201, in that it replaces the ASCII backslash 0x5C (rather than the ASCII dollar sign 0x24 as in GB 1988 / ISO 646-CN) with the yen/yuan sign. It also uses the same C0 replacement graphics as code page 897. It is closely related to Code page 904, which is encoded for use as the single byte component of certain traditional Chinese character encodings, and uses the same C0 replacement graphics, but follows ASCII. ===Others=== File:PC-8001 character set.pngNEC PC-8001 (1979) character set as rendered in the 8×8 pixel font File:NEC-C-6220-paths.svgNEC variant used on the PC98 series.

Composer of over 500 songs, Boschetti has also transformed many poems into songs by adding music to the lyrics. == Early years == Boschetti was born in Santurce, a section of San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico. However, he was raised in the town of Corozal where his mother's family came from. There he received his primary and secondary education and at an early age was introduced to the world of music when his mother gave him a guitar as a present. In 1964, he wrote in English his first song influenced by the styles of the Beatles, Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan.Americo Boschetti Haciendo Punto en Otro Son In 1968, Boschetti enrolled at the University of Puerto Rico and became involved in the Puerto Rican independence movement. He was also involved in the student protests of that era against the Vietnam War, the presence of the ROTC in the university's campus and other political issues. He started writing songs directed towards social reforms and romantic themes. == Musical style == His compositions were not limited to one particular style, but to a diversified variety of styles which included rock and roll, bolero, salsa, etc. The death of his mother Conchita, in 1970 affected him very much and may be reflected in the songs which he wrote in tribute to women, love and children. In 1973, Boschetti decided to self-exile to avoid the U.S. military draft. The exile, which lasted until 1978, started in Europe, continued in Canada and ended in the United States. While in Europe, Boschetti wrote an operetta based on the drowning of Diego Salcedo by the Taíno Agueybana II, nephew of Taíno Cacique Agüeybaná. The operetta included 36 of Boschetti's songs and was written as a play in 1975 in Stromboli, Italy and made into an operetta in the United States in 1977 in Mandeville, Louisiana. Boschetti returned to Puerto Rico in 1978, however in 1977 he secretly visited the island to meet with Puerto Rican singer Danny Rivera. Rivera agreed to record one of Boschetti's song La Guaracha del ruiseñor, which he included in his album Alborada. Once Boschetti reestablished himself in the island, he co- founded the group \\"Colindancias\\". In 1981, Boschetti made his recording debut with the song Colindancias and went on tour. == Compositions == Among Boschetti's compositions are the following: * Guajira de la Espera * Manuela * Mujer * El Cántico de las Hojas * La Guaracha del Ruiseñor * Mi Tierra Mía * Señorita Sylvia * Canción para los Ninos * La Mujer de las Islas In 1984, he decided to take a vacation (semi-retired) from the world of music. He had written over 500 songs and had also transformed some of the poems from the likes of Jose de Diego, Luis Lloréns Torres, Julia de Burgos, Juan Antonio Corretjer and José Martí into songs by adding music to the lyrics. During his vacation his songs were recorded by many artists, among them Haciendo Punto en Otro Son, Katraska, Danny Rivera, Perla del Sur, Cheo Feliciano, Josy Latorre, and Moliendo Vidrio. == Later years == In 2000, he returned from his retirement and released Antología sencilla (Simple Anthology), which included 13 new compositions and 11 of his earlier songs. On April 25, 2004 he composed and recorded Canción Elegía, which he dedicated to Carlos Muñiz Varela, a young Cuban civil rights advocate who was murdered.

Also seen are two antennae; the one seen between the two speakers is for a two-way radio, while the one seen in front of the flashing light on the left is probably for the vehicle's conventional AM/FM radio. Emergency vehicle equipment is any equipment fitted to, or carried by, an emergency vehicle, other than the equipment that a standard non-emergency vehicle is fitted with (such as headlights, steering wheels, and windshield/windscreens). ==Visual warning devices== Emergency vehicles of any kind (fire truck, ambulance, police car) are highly likely to be involved in hazardous situations, including relatively common incidents such as a road traffic collision. They are also required to gain access to incidents as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws; for instance, they may be able to treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a give way, or be permitted to break the speed limit. However, emergency vehicles usually are not able to treat a railroad crossing as a give way, because a train cannot be warned in time to stop before the crossing to let the vehicle through. Hence, one of the few things emergency vehicles must yield to are heavy freight and passenger trains. For these reasons, emergency vehicles in many countries worldwide, are fitted with visual warnings to alert members of the public (and in particular, other motorists and road users), either as they approach the vehicle, or it approaches them. Visual warnings can be of two types - passive warning or active warning. ===Passive visual warnings=== Composite picture of two ambulance vehicles in different light sources showing retroreflective high visibility battenburg markings in light and dark conditions The passive visual warnings are usually inherently linked to the design of the vehicle, and involve the use of high contrast patterns. Older vehicles (and those in developing countries) are more likely to have their pattern painted on, whereas modern vehicles generally carry the retro-reflective designs which reflect light from car headlights or torches (and was invented by 3M). Popular patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called 'Battenburg markings'), chevrons (arrowheads - often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards on the rear) or stripes (along the side - these were the first type or retro-reflective device introduced, as the original 3M reflective material only came in tape form). In some countries, in addition to retro-reflective markings, the vehicles are now painted in a bright yellow or orange colour underneath, in order to maximise visual impact. Another passive marking form is the name of the emergency service spelled out in reverse on the front of the vehicle (e.g. Ambulance or Fire). This enables drivers of other vehicles to more easily identify an approaching emergency vehicle in their rear view mirrors. The vehicle may also display the name of their owner or operator, and a telephone number which may be used to summon the vehicle. Battenburg colour scheme, popular in the UK Ambulances may also carry an emblem (either as part of the passive warning markings or not). Some ambulances may display a Red Cross, Red Crescent or Red Diamond (collective known as the Protective Symbols). These are symbols laid down by the Geneva Conventions, and all countries signatory to it agree to restrict their use to either (1) Military Ambulances or (2) the national Red Cross or Red Crescent society. Use by any other person, organisation or agency is in breach of international law. The protective symbols are designed to indicate to all people (especially combatants in the case of war) that the vehicle is neutral and is not to be fired upon (see Military ambulances), hence giving protection to the medics and their casualties, although this has not always been adhered to. Many ambulances use the Star of Life, which indicates that the vehicle's operators can render their given level of care represented on the six pointed star. ===Active visual warnings=== An American fire engine lit up at night. Notice the use of lights and reflective markings on the vehicle. An American ambulance also with all its lights turned on. The active visual warnings are usually in the form of flashing coloured lights (also known as 'beacons' or 'lightbars'). These flash in order to attract the attention of other road users as the emergency vehicle approaches, or to provide warning to motorists approaching a stopped vehicle in a dangerous position on the road (and if the emergency vehicle positions itself to deliberately move people away from an incident, this is called fend off). Common colours for emergency vehicle warning beacons are blue and red, and this varies by country (and sometimes by operator). The lights can be made to flash via a range of techniques, dependent on the technology used, and the desired end effect. Types of beacon include: * Light bars - A long but narrow 'strip' of lights on top of an emergency vehicle, which can be configured with almost infinite combinations of different lighting technologies from the list below. These are typically the main source of flashing light for the vehicle, and are used on overt marked emergency vehicles. They can also be divided into sections, with an array of functions (for instance front blue flashing lights, and rear red flashing lights, switched separately). Due to the nature of the wind resistance encountered by these large units, the majority must be fixed to the car permanently, although some units (usually smaller) are available with either magnetic or suction cup mountings which can be removed. The Light bar may also contain the Audible Warning devices. Some jurisdictions disallow the sale of lightbars to the general public (especially if mandated under state and/or federal law regardless of lens coloring which are not red and blue). * Beacons - A simple lighting device, often found on smaller emergency vehicles, or unmarked cars, (where it is removable) and consists of a clear or transparent coloured casing surrounding a lamp and a revolving mirror. Some beacons consist of one or several lamps that revolve, instead of using a mirror. These were the original type of emergency vehicle lighting * Alternating Vehicle Lights or Wig-wags - This causes the Full beam headlights, or Fog lights to flash in a pattern (usually alternating left-right-left, although it can be together, or in a random pattern), and can also be used at the rear of the vehicle on Brake, Fog or reversing lights to warn vehicles approaching from the rear. * Grille lights - Flashing lights fitted on, into or behind the grille of the emergency vehicle, creating forward-facing flashing effects, designed to be seen in the rear view mirror of moving traffic in front of the vehicle. These can be fitted to both overt and covert emergency vehicles, by simply changing whether they are mounted internally or externally, or by varying the lens colour (so that they may look like fog lights on a covert vehicle) * Dash Lights - These are forward-facing lights, like grille lights, but mounted on the dashboard of the emergency vehicle. They are more often found on covert vehicles, but may be found on some marked vehicles which are trying to increase visibility. In order to avoid dazzling the driver, they are normally fitted with 'shields' around the light which stop the light reflecting into the cab. * Deck lights (or Parcel Shelf lights) - Rear-facing equivalents of the Dash Lights which are placed on the Parcel Shelf of the vehicle. These can be used in both overt and covert vehicles. Directional warning arrows located in the centre of this fire engine. ACT Fire Brigade Heavy Rescue pumper with the emergency lights activated. * Directional Warning Arrows or arrow sticks - A strip of lights (typically amber or yellow) which light up in sequence to direct traffic to the right, left, or around both sides of an emergency vehicle. They may be found mounted on the back of a lightbar, on a car's package shelf (shining out the rear window) or on some other conspicuous location on the rear of a vehicle. * Information Matrix Signs - These special active visual warnings are used to convey words to vehicles approaching from behind the emergency vehicle and often carry messages such as \\"Police. Stop\\" or other relevant message. Some systems allow only preprogrammed messages, where others can be fully customised. Many governments list specific requirements for emergency vehicle lighting. These requirements may address the colour, location and intensity/visibility of the lights, and whether they should flash or burn steadily. Laws also may regulate what vehicles may display these lights, and under what circumstances they may do so. The warning lights may be of several types, which includes: * Incandescent - These are 'traditional' light bulbs, and may be found in the 'beacon' type lights, and will also be found where the vehicle's own lighting is used (such as wig-wag). Bulbs may be Halogen or Xenon type. They may use a rotating mirror to make them flash, or are simply turned on and off. * Strobe lights - These lights give a short flash, which has high brightness compared to an incandescent light. They are usually made to work in multiples (such as three rapid flashes consecutively) and are often used in patterns between sets, which increases their effectiveness. * LED lights - These are more recent developments, using the 'Super Bright' LED technology, and are entering wide use as they are easy to fit (being only a few millimetres wide, rather than several centimetres for most strobes and incandescent lights). This makes them particularly suitable for covert use. Though currently much more expensive than other types of lamps, there are substantial benefits. They draw much less electric current than other types of lamps which is a valuable reduction in electrical load on these vehicles' over-stressed electrical systems. They are much more resistant to vibration and have much longer service lives. They also present very saturated colors and so enhance visibility during daylight hours. ==Audible warning devices (sirens)== The Whelen(R) siren's wail, yelp and phaser tones are a familiar sound in many cities When an emergency vehicle is responding, it often uses audio warning devices in addition to the visual warnings provided by its warning lights. Audio warning devices are turned off once the vehicle is on- scene. Such devices include: * Sirens - These can be fully electronic, electric, or manual, but are all designed to create changing sound patterns. These patterns vary by model of siren. Emergency drivers are often trained to use different siren tones in different conditions, to achieve maximum effectiveness through traffic. A long-standing problem for emergency services has been traffic being unable to determine the direction a siren is approaching from, and different tones have been developed on some electronic sirens to help combat this, such as the use of white or pink noise in between more conventional siren noises, which helps people to pinpoint their origin. * Public address system - Sometimes linked to the electronic or electric siren, or possibly stand alone, this system allows the voice of the operator to be amplified to give direction. This is found especially useful in heavy pedestrian traffic. A fire truck uses an air horn to alert cars of its presence * Air horn - These devices force compressed air from the vehicle's air brake system against a diaphragm, creating a loud noise. Air horns used on emergency vehicles usually have a distinctive tone so they can easily be distinguished from other large vehicles, commanding urgency. In Europe, they are sometimes used to create the classic two tone 'nee naw' sound which led to the colloquial expression for lights and sirens on emergency vehicles of blues and twos. Due to the need for compressed air in order to operate, they are primarily found in fire engines and large ambulances but not in police cars and other small vehicles since they do not contain air brakes. * Bells - Usually found on older or classic emergency vehicles, these were the original methods of notifying people of the approach of emergency vehicles. They were first conventional hand rung bells, and later replaced by electric driven \\"Gong\\"versions. * Exhaust whistles - These are no longer used, but still referred to in some legislation, and may be found on classic emergency vehicles, an exhaust whistle is fitted to a vehicle's exhaust pipe, and functions similar to a steam whistle, with the exhaust gasses replacing the steam. Some emergency vehicle operators occasionally turn off their sirens when on side streets or when there are no cars on the road so as not to disturb residents; however, there is seldom a mandate for responders to do so. The driver will then turn on the sirens before proceeding through intersections or when traveling on potentially dangerous stretches of road. === Justification for use === Anecdotally, the purpose of audible warnings on emergency vehicles is to enable quicker arrival on scene, and to promote safety of crews and spectators. However, rigorous scientific support for this position is very limited. A peer-reviewed study by Hunt et al concluded \\"the 43.5-second mean time savings does not warrant the use of lights and siren during ambulance transport, except in rare situations or clinical circumstances.\\" In 2017, no scientific studies were found to weigh the benefits of sirens against the costs and hazards of the resulting urban noise.Freedom-of-information requests (2017) by author to: Health Canada; Transport Canada; Ontario Department of Transport; City of Toronto. ==Auxiliary lighting== Auxiliary lighting is light used for illumination, to supplement factory-installed headlights or to illuminate areas to the side of or behind the vehicle. It is typically white or near-white light. Some emergency scenes require additional lighting if the emergency workers are to be able to effectively deal with the emergency. Also, building numbers are often obscured by darkness, making it difficult for emergency workers to find the scene of an emergency. For these reasons, emergency vehicles are often equipped with auxiliary lighting, such as: * spot-lights, which may be mounted on the side, top, or rear of a larger vehicle, or on the A-post/A-pillar of smaller vehicles. In some states where police vehicles are decommissioned, the department reserves the right to include the spotlight defined as emergency vehicle lighting; in the State of Texas since September 1, 2015 decommissioned police vehicles are sold without the A-pillar spotlight regardless of the lens color (white, or red/blue). Although the vehicle-mounted spot-light is available for purchase e.g. eBay, amazon.com, Craigslist, some states are regulating the sales of certain emergency vehicle equipment as part of a policy mandated by the Department of Homeland Security. * flood lights, which may similarly be mounted on the side, top, or rear of a larger vehicle. * load lights, which are used by ambulances and other vehicles with cargo doors to light up the area around the cargo doors. * alley lights, which are typically found mounted on the side of a police car or emergency vehicle's lightbar, for the purpose of illuminating areas to the side of the car, such as into an alley, or a scene at the side of the road. * take-downs, which are typically mounted on the front of an emergency vehicle's lightbar. Take-downs are used on police cars to illuminate the interior of a vehicle immediately in front of the police car, such as a vehicle that has been pulled over after committing a traffic violation or while conducting a high-risk vehicle stop (also called a felony stop). The bright lights also serve to blind the vision of suspects looking back toward the police. Take-downs are also used on ambulances and other vehicles to illuminate a work area in front of the vehicle, such as a patient in the roadway, an accident scene, or a fire scene. ==Communications devices== Efficient emergency responses require that emergency responders can communicate with a dispatcher, with each other, and often with other facilities (such as hospitals or public utilities). Emergency vehicles are equipped with the following types of equipment to do so: * two-way radio, usually operating on dedicated frequencies and channels designated for emergency use, or in some cases simply a CB radio. * portable two-way radios, which transmit and receive on the same frequencies as the built in two-way radios, but are less powerful. Emergency workers can take these radios with them when they exit the vehicle. There are also systems (frequently referred to as mobile extenders or mobile repeaters) that allow the portable radios to be relayed through the vehicle's more powerful two way radio. Some emergency services encrypt their radio transmissions. * car phones or portable cellular phones. * mobile data terminals, or MDTs, which are computers that communicate with the dispatcher's computer. * Laptop computers with Wi-Fi connections, usually with a mounting point or docking station within the vehicle. These can be used as an alternative to MDTs. * PA or bullhorn to communicate with other workers, or with members of the public. Most electronic sirens are equipped with a PA. * dashcams, usually video and audio equipment used during DUI stops, inclusive of bodycams worn by on duty police officers ==Service/unit- specific equipment== Different services require different types of equipment at emergency scenes (ambulances and fire trucks carry different types of equipment), and within one service, different units may require different equipment. ===Medical services=== * Ambulance * Helicopter * Air ambulance ===Fire=== Fire service units and their role differ between countries. * Fire apparatus ===Police=== * Armed response vehicles/SWAT vehicles * Motorway/highway patrol vehicles * Police car * Police aircraft * Police motorcycle * Police van ==See also== *Teardrop light *Blues and twos == References == ==External links== * paper discussing safety equipment on police cars, specifically addressing equipment to address a series of Ford Crown Victorias that suffered rear-end-collisions resulting in fires, and addressing the use of flashing lights, reflectors, &c; on police vehicles (PDF file) *Florida Highway Patrol Lighting and Siren Evaluation *Ford Announces Development of 2011 Police Interceptor for Law Enforcement *Emergency Response Vehicle Operations Policy And Planning Category:Emergency vehicles ","title":"Emergency vehicle equipment"},{"id":"3230653","text":"Blaine F. Calkins (born December 25, 1968) is a Conservative Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada. He has represented the riding of Red Deer—Lacombe in Alberta since 2015, having previously represented its predecessor, Wetaskiwin, since 2006. Calkins was born and raised in the Lacombe, Alberta area. He graduated from the University of Alberta in 1992 with a Bachelor of Science with specialization in zoology.Official Web Page Biography He later became a tenured faculty member at Red Deer College. He began his career in politics as a member of the Lacombe Town Council, and as such has been involved with the board of directors of the Lacombe Municipal Ambulance Society, the board of directors for Family and Community Support Services, The Municipal Planning Commission, David Thompson Tourist Council and the Disaster Services Committee. Blaine Calkins became a member of the Reform Party in 1996, and followed most of the party into the Canadian Alliance in 2000 and the Conservative Party in 2004. He served on the Candidate Nomination Committee for the Reform Party in Wetaskiwin riding in 1999, and joined the board of directors for the Alliance's riding nomination committee in 2000. Since then, he has held various board positions, including president, vice president and director of communications. He was elected to Parliament for Wetaskiwin in 2006. The riding was abolished in 2015, and Calkins successfully ran in Red Deer—Lacombe, essentially the southern part of his old riding (including its largest city, Lacombe) combined with the northern half of the old Red Deer riding. ==Electoral record== ==Political career== === CPC Alberta Caucus Chair=== Blaine served as the Caucus Chair for the Alberta Caucus of the Conservative Party of Canada in both the 41st and 42nd Parliament. As the Caucus Chair, Blaine has been responsible for facilitating dialogue between all of the Conservative MPs from Alberta and helping to coherently present issues effecting the province to Regional Ministers while in Government and directly to Conservative Leadership while in opposition. Given the size of the Alberta Conservative Caucus and the various Ministers and prominent Members of Parliament from Alberta, previously including Premier Jason Kenney and former Interim Leader of the Official Opposition the Hon. Rona Ambrose, Alberta Caucus continues to be an important voice in the Conservative Parliamentary Caucus. ===Ethics=== From February 4, 2016 to September 18, 2017 Calkins was the Chair of the Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics. During his time as Chair the committee undertook important studies including a review of the Privacy Act, the Access to Information Act and a review of the Security of Canada Information Sharing Act In January 2017, while Chair of the Ethics Committee, Calkins wrote a letter to then Ethics Commissioner, Mary Dawson, highlighting a number of concerns he had about a trip Prime Minister Trudeau had accepted to the Bahamas. On December 20, 2017 the Ethics Commissioner released her report, finding that the Prime Minister had violated multiple sections of the Conflict of Interest Act, including sections that Calkins had raised in his letter. ===Conservative Hunting and Angling Caucus=== Blaine helped found and served as vice-chair and is currently the chair of the Conservative Hunting and Angling Caucus (CHAC). The CHAC was founded in order to help ensure that hunters, anglers, trappers and all those who participate in the outdoor way of life are robustly represented in the Conservative Party and in parliament. As a former Park Warden and avid outdoorsman, Blaine passionately defends the outdoor way of life, in order to ensure that future generations are able to continue this important way of life, and that Canadians have access to public lands to sustainably harvest wildlife resources as Canadians have since first contact, and First Nations people have since time immemorial. ==Political views== ===Support for Labourers=== In the 41st Parliament, Calkins passed a Private Members Bill called the Employees’ Voting Rights Act to make union certification votes down by secret ballot, to help prevent intimidation tactics that have been reported during certification proceedings under the card-check system. The Act also set the threshold to trigger a certification or decertification vote at 45% of bargaining unit members indicating they wish to have a vote, and standardized the secret ballot threshold for the successful creation or continuation of a bargaining agent. While the Employees’ Voting Rights Act passed and became law under the Conservative Government, one of the first acts of the Trudeau Government was to repeal these protections for workers. ===Honouring Korean War Veterans=== Calkins co- sponsored legislation with Senator Yonah Martin to make the 27th of July each year known as “National Korean War Veterans Day.” The Korean War is also known as the Forgotten War, receiving much less attention than other conflicts in which Canada played a vital role. Calkins and Senator Martin believed Canadians have a duty to recognize the sacrifice of over 26,000 men and women who courageously defended the principles of peace, freedom and democracy in the Korean peninsula, in particular the 516 who made the ultimate sacrifice. Calkins continues to pay homage to the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces both past and present who have given so much to preserve our freedom. ===Rural Crime=== Calkins has been actively working on addressing the rural crime issue in Canada. In Fall of 2017 Calkins co-chaired the CPC Alberta MP Rural Crime Taskforce. This was in partnership with United Conservative Party MLAs who conducted a similar study. The task force met with residents from rural Alberta, including community groups and law enforcement to hear about concerns of residents province-wide and compiled a report making recommendations to the government of Canada to address the issue of rural crime. The report was submitted as a brief to the Standing Committee on Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness during their study on M-167 about rural crime. The Liberals on the committee rejected all of the recommendations, causing the Conservative Members to submit a dissenting report. Calkins put forward a Private Members Bill, C-458, which seeks to make remoteness an aggravating factor at sentencing, in response to what he called an “insulting” report from the Committee on Public Safety. While the bill was unable to be advanced past first reading in the 42nd Parliament, Calkins committed to reintroducing it if re-elected. Alberta Justice Minister Dough Schweitzer wrote a letter supporting Calkins PMB. ===Carbon tax=== According to a December 14, 2018 recording by a Radio-Canada reporter of a talk given by Calkins to students in grades 7 and 8 in Red Deer, Calkins responded to a question about the carbon tax by saying that he was a biologist and that was plant food not pollution. He told students that he understood there was an impact on the environment from burning fossil fuels but he questioned whether burning fossil fuels \\"caused extreme weather events\\". Calkins told them, \\"There's just more people now than there was before. So, when we have a major weather event, more people get affected, because the chances of it affecting people are that much higher.\\" In a follow-up article on December 18, Conseil Scolaire Centre-Nord's (CSCN) superintendent, Robert Lessard, responded by saying that these comments were Calkins' own personal opinions, whereas in CSCN, they teach facts about the \\"biological cycle of carbon\\", and \\"ecological impacts [of environment on the planet] that need to be taken care of.\\" Shawn Marshall, who is a University of Calgary Geography professor as well as a Tier II Canada Research Chair in Climate Change, said that Calkins' \\"half truths\\" without context, are typical examples of \\"climate misinformation\\" used by politicians who oppose the carbon tax, \\"to paralyze us a little bit\\". His concern was that they were introduced to junior youth. Marshall said that Calkins failed to add that humans are generating more than plants can take up, and that while we do have a larger population vulnerable to extreme weather events, \\"there's also this huge overprint of climate change on these extreme weather events.\\" ==References== ==External links== *Blaine Calkins website * Category:1968 births Category:Conservative Party of Canada MPs Category:Living people Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Alberta Category:People from Lacombe, Alberta Category:People from Ponoka, Alberta Category:University of Alberta alumni Category:21st-century Canadian politicians Category:Current Members of the House of Commons of Canada ","title":"Blaine Calkins"},{"id":"3230666","text":"In Greek mythology, Kleodora was one of the prophetic Thriai, nymphs who divined the future by throwing stones or pebbles. She and her sisters Melaina and Daphne lived on Mount Parnassus, where Delphi is located and was loved by Poseidon. With Poseidon she became the mother of Parnassus.Pausanias, 10.6.13. In myths where demigods have two fathers the other is listed as Kleopompos. Parnassus is famous for creating a method of telling the future by using birds and founding the main city on Mt. Parnassus. Her father was the local river- god Cephissus of northern Boeotia. The meaning of her name and the names of her sisters connect her to the future and Apollo. Kleodora means Glorious Gift, Melania means The Black, and Daphnis means Laurel. Kleodora's name refers to her gift of prophecy. Melania's name refers to the black that would surround the stones used for Prophecy. Daphnis' name is directly related to Apollo because laurels were often used to represent him. ==The Death of Python== According to the myth of Apollo's origins,REFLECTIONS ON THE ORIGINS OF THE ORACULAR APOLLO - Dietrich - 2010 - Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies - Wiley Online Library http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2041-5370.1978.tb00379.x/abstract cross-referenced with a report on how honey is related to early mythology,Honey plays a significant role in the mythology and history of many cultures - Mad_Honey.pdf http://www.redbluffpark.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/12/Mad_Honey.pdf Kleodora was one of the Thriae, three prophetic nymphs who originally translated for the Python, Python being the original Oracle of Delphi. Because Hera did not like Zeus's mistresses, she commanded Python to follow Leto whenever she was in the sun, so that she would never have any rest during the pregnancy. Shortly after his birth, Apollo discovered this and destroyed Python. He was trained in his mantic arts by the Thriae. Kleodora specialized in prophesying with small stones, which likely means that she was using Lithomancy.Types of Divination http://www.enlightened-pathways.com/typesofdiv.html. ==Lithomancy== The type prophecy that Kleodora would have engaged in, while not translating, was Lithomancy. The word Lithomancy comes from the Greek word Lithos, meaning stone, and manteia, meaning prophecy. Lithomancy - Lithomancy, divination by stones - Occultopedia, the Occult and Unexplained Encyclopedia http://www.occultopedia.com/l/lithomancy.htm The gemstones used had different properties based on what kind of stone they were. Some could be for temporal discoveries, while others could be medicinal remedies. In the reflection method of Divination, the stones were cast on a black sheet and looked at by candle light. The different colors of the reflections determined if the reading was good or bad, or even what it was about. Another method determined the future by where the stones landed in relation to a central candle. In this case, each stone represented something in particular. It has been suggested that Lithomancy is a precursor to rune stones. ==Other forms of Divination== Lithomancy was likely an offshoot of the much more common lots. Using lots was common all over the ancient world. The differences between lots and stones are slim, but important. Lots were often used for numerical things. They were used for counting or choosing one thing out of a group. Using stones was very localized to Greece and not often used for anything other than prophecy. As one of the prophetesses of the Oracle of Delphi, Kleodora would likely have known everything about the process of delivering a prophecy from the Oracle. It was a very ritualistic experience, starting with ice water being poured over a goat to determine if Apollo was present for the day. If the goat shivered then everything was deemed good and the goat was sacrificed. The Prophetess then would stay inside her chamber by herself, breathing in the fumes in solitude. She would then be confronted with the question of whoever had come to see her. When a prophetess died, a new one would be chosen from her interpreters. All of the interpreters had to be virgin women who were epileptic. Later, the extra qualification of old was added on. Epileptic people were viewed as closer to the gods. It is quite possible that Kleodora herself became the Oracle at one point. ==Celebrating Dionysus== In addition to Delphi being the site of Apollo worship, it was also popular with worshipers of Dionysus. These women were called Thyiades and they made a pilgrimage up the mountain to celebrate Dionysus with orgies. Knowing the nature of nymphs, it's highly likely that Kleodora and her sisters took part in these activities. It was said that the cries of the women could be heard from towns away at all hours of the night. This happened during the time that Greece was still city states with cults rather than a united nation. It's quite likely that there was a Dionysus cult and an Apollo cult in close range to each other. This would explain why the same minor figure appears in two very different stories about two very different gods. It's also possible that another cult belonging to Poseidon was also in the area, which is probably how she got involved with him. ==References== ==External links== *http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheKleodora.html Category:Thriae ","title":"Kleodora"},{"id":"3230678","text":"The Boyer River is a tributary of the Missouri River, long,U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed March 30, 2011 in western Iowa in the United States. Most reaches of the river's course have been straightened and channelized. The Boyer River is named for a settler who hunted and trapped in the watershed before the time of Lewis and Clark. Explorers, including Lewis and Clark, John James Audubon, and Prince Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied, navigated through the region near the mouth of the Boyer as they traveled up the Missouri River. This area is now part of the Boyer Chute National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). This was originally an island of sand and sediment deposited in the Missouri River by the Boyer River. Gradually, the Missouri River eroded a major channel (chute) through the sediment; this came to be known as Boyer Chute, and was the preferred channel used by explorers and traders until the Missouri eventually changed its course. ==Course== The Boyer River rises near Storm Lake in southwestern Buena Vista County and initially flows southwardly into Sac County. In southern Sac County it turns southwestward and flows through Crawford, Harrison and Pottawattamie Counties, past the towns of Deloit, Denison, Arion, Dow City, Dunlap, Woodbine, Logan and Missouri Valley. It enters the Missouri River in northwestern Pottawattamie County, north of Council Bluffs.

Laura Rodgers is the current principal and Sondra Lundvick is the current vice principal. ==Extracurriculars== Sitka High School's sports teams are known as the Sitka Wolves with female teams sometimes known as the Lady Wolves. All teams compete at the 3A level of interscholastic competition in Alaska (as dictated by the Alaska School Activities Association), the second highest level of competition available in the state for schools with an enrollment less than 400. SHS's traditionally most successful sports are softball, baseball, swimming, and wrestling, with the former two claiming state championships in the 2004-2005 school year and with baseball and swimming claiming championships in the 2005-2006 school year. In the 2006-2007 school year, boys' swimming claimed another state championship and the Wolves baseball three-peated, winning their state for the third time in a row. In the past three years Sitka High School has won the Region V 4A Wrestling championships twice. SHS is also renowned for its competitive drama, debate, and forensics (DDF) team, which has multiple state championships under its belt, including a forensics state championship in 2005-2006, 2008–2009, and 2009–2010 and its music program and jazz band, which has taken awards at the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival and Columbia Basin Jazz Festival.

Michael grew up and was educated in a mixed neighborhood of Jews, Muslims, and Christians in Baghdad. Michael completed his education in the Jewish educational system of Baghdad, in Shamash School, receiving his high school diploma in 1945. At the age of 15, two years after the outbreak of World War II, he joined and soon became a leader of a leftist (Communist) underground group acting against the oppressive regime in Iraq. Michael later wrote about this period of his life in his novel A Handful of Fog. Shortly after, aged 17, he began writing articles for the Iraqi press. His political activities led to a warrant being issued for his arrest in 1948, Michael was forced to flee and went to Iran. The Iraqi court sentenced him to death in absentia. In Iran, he joined the communist party, Tudeh. Unable to return to Iraq, Michael came to Israel in 1949. Michael arrived in Israel alone, his family remaining in Iraq, joining him later (1951). In the early fifties the majority of Iraqi Jewry left Iraq, forced to relinquish their Iraqi citizenship. Michael, on the other hand, today still holds Iraqi citizenship, as he did not officially give it up. In Israel, his sister Nadia married Israeli spy Eli Cohen. Cohen, a Mossad spy, was captured by Syrian authorities after achieving high-level penetration into the Syrian government, and was executed in 1965. Michael claimed that the Mossad had originally tried to recruit him in the 1950s, and only turned to his brother-in-law after he turned them down.https://www.haaretz.com/author- sami-michael-mossad-tried-to-recruit-me-in-1950s-1.370530 Michael settled in an Arab quarter of Haifa, Wadi Nisnas. He was invited to work for a newspaper by Emil Habibi. Michael was the only Jew on the editorial board of Al Ittihad and Al Jadid (Arabic language newspapers of the communist party), where he worked as an editor for four years. At the same time, he had a weekly column in which he wrote stories and articles under the pseudonym Samir Mared. His stories, while written in the spirit of \\"socialist realism\\", were laced with irony and humor. In 1955, disillusioned with the policies of the USSR, he terminated his affiliation with the communist party, and concluded his work on both papers: \\"I left the party but not the ideals of socialism.\\" Michael worked as a hydrologist in the north of Israel (for 25 years). He completed his hydrology studies at the British Institute (London) and went on to study Psychology and Arabic Literature at the University of Haifa. At the age of 45 Michael embarked upon the project of mastering the Hebrew language. In 1974 he published his first novel, in Hebrew, All Men are Equal – But Some are More, about the lives of immigrants in transit camps in Israel in the 1950s. The title of the novel – Shavim ve-Shavim Yoter – became a well-known phrase depicting the struggles for equality of Jews from Arab countries. This book opened the door for profound discussion about the socio-economic gaps in Israel and also about the situation of the Arabs in Israel. Sami Michael has published 11 novels and 3 non-fiction books focusing on cultural, political and social affairs in Israel, 3 plays and a children's book. Most of Michael's books were published by Am Oved publishers. Michael left Am Oved in 2007 and moved to Kinneret Zmora-Bitan Dvir publishers after receiving a very attractive offer, granting him a fixed monthly salary. His first book that published with them was Aida. Michael has also written numerous articles and essays. His writings and his social and political activities have made him a household name in Israel. Michael has never been an author of the establishment, which meant that he did not enjoy promotional or financial assistance. Two cities feature in many of Michael's novels. Victoria, Storm among the Palms, A Handful of Fog and Aida, are set in his home town Baghdad, and Refuge, A Trumpet in the Wadi, Water Kissing Water, and Nabila are set in Haifa, his adopted city. Michael wrote about his departure from Iraq and arrival in Haifa when he wrote of his first day in Haifa, Israel: : \\"Each kilometer that the airplane gulped, took me further into a one way tunnel. The flight was a difficult separation from a pained love. When I opened my eyes, I imagined that I was looking at a Fata Morgana, which was stranger than anything I had ever known... I loved Haifa then, and about half a century later, I am faithful to this love. But at the beginning of my first day in Israel there were no designated moments for love set aside.\\"Maariv, Supplement, October 10, 1997. a special magazine- refugees write on the first day in Israel. In 1982, he left Haifa for 10 years, moving to the rural, northern Galilee town of Ma'alot, on the hillside overlooking a valley. It is here that he wrote the novel Brown Devils about rock hyraxes that frequently stole the fruits of his well-tended garden. In 1992 Michael he returned to Haifa. Sami Michael's Way – \\"The man is the crown of creation\\" (literary way) – is a route in the Wadi Nisnas, an Arab quarter of Haifa, named after Michael in 2002. Literary extracts from his novels are written along the walls of the route, both in Hebrew and in Arabic. Michael dedicated three novels to Wadi Nisnas including: A Trumpet in the Wadi. In 2008, Michael was appointed as an honorary member of the Arabic Language Academy in Israel. In 1987 the Israeli High Court of Justice appointed Michael as arbitrator to decide on a matter of education and multiculturalism. The subject was widely covered in the press, and his decision was a precedent in Israel which still stands. Michael is the chairperson of the Aachi Council- a council of Iraqi artists in Israel. He was a member of staff of the Jewish Quarterly in London. In 1998, Michael hosted a 13-part series on the Educational Television channel on World Literature, where he engaged writers, researchers and scholars in discussion about their favorite literary masterpieces. A number of documentaries films and programs on Michael have been made. Michael is a nominee for the Nobel Prize for Literature. In 2013, the Sami Michael Association was formed with the aim of upholding Michael's heritage. As of 2017, the nonprofit department awards individuals \\"who work for society with regard to reducing gaps and providing equal opportunities, in the spirit of author Sami Michael's concept of heritage, with an emphasis on social and geographical periphery.\\" Among the winners of the award are Shula Mola, Yoav Lalom, Netta Elkayam and Ibtisam Mara'ana. ==Writing== Michael's mother tongue is Arabic. It took him roughly 15 years to make the move from writing in Arabic to Hebrew. He has defined the switch as a \\"miracle\\": : \\"It sometimes happens to me while writing, that I seek a word; mischievous as it is it appears in English, it appears in Arabic, but refuses to come in Hebrew. To some extent I made up my Hebrew. Unquestionably, the influence of Arabic is dominant, my syntax is almost : \\"When Victoria came out in Cairo, in the preface it was written that 'this is an Arabic novel written in Hebrew'. I took it as a compliment.\\" He wrote his first novel in Arabic, which won a prize awarded by the Communist Party. On leaving the party, he ceded publication of the book. Throwing the handwritten copy away, Unbounded Ideas. : \\"In his study, amongst books in Hebrew, Arabic and English – novels, poetry, politics, history and science – lies on the table a student's folder and inside it neatly arranged pages of his next novel – all handwritten in exemplary fashion on white paper; rows of sentences in perfectly straight lines, that later he will cross out again and again until he decides that this is it, it can be typed. Not by himself. 'At my age you want me to write on a computer? I belong to the generation that does not press buttons, but rather turn them,' he explains, 'I could not do otherwise. I need the contact of the pen where the words flow from the hand on to the page.'\\" Yedioth Ahronoth, 28 May 2008, a special supplement for the Hebrew Book Week Michael has fixed hours for writing: twice a day – morning and afternoon. While writing, he disconnects from everything. He does not have a telephone in his study, where he writes. He insists on finishing the novel in the same room in which he started it. He started to write Victoria in his garden shed in Ma'alot, and when he sold the house and moved back to Haifa, he had not complete his book, he asked the buyer to allow him to continue living there until he finished writing Victoria – paying full rent of course. During his writing he does not show it, not even a chapter to anyone. Nor does he consult with anyone. \\"A good writer in known not only in by good writing but also in his ability to throw away without mercy, to erase and to leave a pure text.\\" \\"At the end of the process – approximately three years from the beginning of a book, it will be typed. He does not show his unfinished handwriting, not even to his editor. Here is the place where stubbornness and the joy of creating join to become one determined decision, with the last word left to Michael at all times.[5] He mostly discards the whole novel and begins writing again. He wrote the novel Water Kissing Water over 20 years, and the version that was finally published was the eighth version. During this time he had other novels published, including: Unbounded Ideas. He declares that he writes from the gut, without planning out the novel. He likes to surprise himself, although he adds: At the Heart of literature is the plot. When there is no plot, in my opinion, it is not literature but rather another academic exercise.\\" His books are bestsellers, and his readers are from diverse social strata. His style has been nurtured by both the treasures of the Hebrew language and the wealth of the Arab language. Many would say that Michael generated the revolution of pluralism in Israeli literature in that his protagonists are always “the other”, mainly focusing on Arabs, women, refugees and immigrants. Michael says \\"life experience has given me a whole gallery of characters.\\" Michael: : \\"My childhood was soaked in the wisdom of women. I was amazed by the richness of their imagination. I remember with wonder how a woman, at the age of 90, toothless would become pretty when playing a princess waiting for her prince.\\" His novels explore a wide range of interlocking relationships – social, ethnic and political – between Jews and Arabs, Moslems and Christians, nationalists and communists and Iraq and Israel, at times comparable to the multiple political identities within Michael himself. \\"It is as if, sometimes, I feel I am two persons. One is an Arab Iraqi, the other an Israeli Jew.\\" Michael's writing is characterized by its humor, painful irony, empathy and tolerance. His style is clean, direct, and bare of symbols, yet with an outstanding expressiveness. Each story exudes authenticity and personal involvement. His writing, rich in imagery. With a scathing realism, he exposes the weaknesses and virtue of the human being, but always with a jealous regard for his honor, freedom and compassion. In his books he describes the Jewish-Arab conflict of its deep national, psychological and social aspects. The longing for social justice, equality between peoples, communities and gender are a central motif in Michael's writing that smashes stereotypes and prejudices. Michael was the first Hebrew author to make the Arab the protagonist in his stories and his referring to him neither with arrogance nor idealization. His style of writing milks both the treasures of the Hebrew language and the wealth of the Arab language. In all his writing the sanctity of life is uppermost. Michael's books have been translated into many languages and used as text books at universities and schools in Israel and abroad. ==Awards and citations== *1976 (and 1990) – Zeev Prize *1978 – Kogel Prize for fine literature *1981 – Prime Minister Prize *1981 – Petach-Tikva Prize for fine literature *1990 – Prize of the cylinder, Ministry of Education and culture and fund of culture America Israel, Omanut La-Am *1992 – Hans Christian Andersen Award – International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY), Berlin *1993 – Victoria selected as novel of the year in Israeli Radio, Kol Israel *1993 – Am Oved Prize for Victoria *1993 – ACUM Prize for Victoria (1993) *1993 – Wizo Prize for Victoria (Paris) *1994 – Israeli Literature prize (by Ministry of Education, Science and Art) *1996 – Honor prize (Berlin) *1998 – International Rotary prize *1999 – Joseph Avileah Prize *2001 – special prize by Society for International Development (SID), promoted by United Nations and Italian Association for the Promotion of Peace in the Middle East (AISI), Italy *2002 – Awarded Key to the City, Haifa *2004 – Brenner Prize *2005 – President and Hebrew University Prize *2005 – Honorary of Beit Hagefen Arab-Jewish Center *2007 – Wizo Prize (Italy) *2007 – EMET Prize for Arts, Science and Culture *2008 – Gilboa Award for Tolerance and Coexistence *2012 – ACUM Lifetime Achievement Award for literature - \\"The Prize is granted for a long writing career that has spanned many years.

His role in redefining the Israeli experience by broadening its scope and introducing previously unmentioned themes; his ground-breaking work as a protest writer who expressed the discrimination felt both by new immigrants and Israeli Arabs; his role as a leading figure in contemporary Hebrew literature.” University of Haifa (2009): \\"in recognition of his prolific literary contribution, which reflects the many faces of Israeli society with respect for mankind and its freedom. Michael’s public activity that consistently expresses deep commitment to peace, justice and civilian rights; and his contribution to the advancement of mutual understanding between the different denominations and between Jews and Arabs.\\" ===Honoris causa=== Honoris Causa from COMAS, The College of Management Academic Studies (2008): \\"For his contribution in Literature and for his activities on behalf of human rights\\". Honoris Causa Degree from Beit Berl - The Multidisciplinary Academic Instituation (2012): \\"For his great contribution to Hebrew literature; for shaping the cultural landscape of Israeli society through his writings, way of thinking, and public activities; for promoting human and minorities rights in Israel; for nurturing coexistence between Jews and Arabs and encouraging values of equality and justice for all.\\" ==Social and political outlook and activities== Michael is known for his deep commitment to peace, justice and human rights. He is on the board of various councils. Michael is a true left- winger, both socially and politically. While still in Baghdad, he was aware of the social gaps in society, and since his youth, he has been active in the struggle for equality and human rights. In Israel he has never ceased to work for human rights. Michael was amongst a group of leaders of the Communist underground in Iraq. At this time there was no written material on Communism in Arabic, which meant they had to translate everything from English. During his time in Iran Michael joined Tudeh, the Iranian Communist party. Once in Israel he joined the Israeli Communist party; he was a youth leader and worked on the editorial board of Al Itihad and Al Jadid (Arabic language newspapers of the communist party) where he worked as an editor for four years. At the same time, he had a weekly column in which he wrote stories and articles under the pseudonym \\"Samir Mared\\". In 1955, a short time before the mass disillusionment with Stalin he ended his affiliation with the communist party, and concluded his work on both papers: \\"…because they transgressed against all my ideals. Today I am a Marxist.\\"Hadashot, April 1989 \\"Communism was a beautiful illusion; despite the disillusionment I will always believe in the human spirit and justice,\\" said Michael.Haaretz, Ahbar Ha'ir, January, 2010 \\"I joined Communism as a Jew and I left Communism as a Jew\\", wrote Michael in Unbounded Ideas. Since leaving the Communist party Michael chose not to belong to any political organization \\"in order to keep his conceptual independence as an intellectual\\". Not once has Michael said: \\"I am a Party of one man.\\" Michael was amongst the first in Israel (1950's) to call for coexistence between Jews and Arabs, signing the first petition of artists and public figures calling for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Michael goes against the terms \\"Mizrahim\\" and \\"Edot HaMizrach\\", claiming it's a Mapai's fictitious identity to preserve a \\"rival\\" to the \\"Ashkenazim\\" and help them push the \\"Mizrahim\\" below in the social-economic ladder and behind them, so they won't ever be in line with the Israeli elites of European Jewish descent\\"There Are People who Want to Keep Us in the Bottom\\", Sami Michael's 1999 interveiw with Ruvik Rozental.. He's also going against the Mapai manner of labeling all the Oriental Jews as \\"one folk\\" and erasing their unique and individual history as separated communities; he wonders why the real Easterners of his time who were the Eastern European Jewish peasants from the villages weren't labeled as \\"Mizrahi\\" in Israel while fitting it more than the Oriental Jews who were labeled that way.Michael is also against the inclusion of Oriental Jewish communities who do not descend from Sepharadic Jews, as his own Iraqi Jews, as \\"Sepharadim\\" by the Israeli politicians, calling it \\"historically inaccurate\\". He also mentions that his work as an author is always referred to as \\"Ethnic\\" while European Jews' work, even if histoic in theme, isn't for that very racism.\\"There Are People who Want to Keep Us in the Bottom\\", Sami Michael's 1999 interveiw with Ruvik Rozental. Michael was invited to give lectures in Cairo directly following the signing of the peace agreement between Israel and Egypt. During the first Palestinian Intifada (uprising) he was amongst a delegation of intellectuals that broke through IDF barriers that besieged Hebron. In 1994 Michael, was invited together with Palestinian author Emil Habibi to Tunis (at a time when Israelis could not travel there) sponsored by UNESCO and the Tunisian Ministry of Culture for a conference in Carthago on Arabic Literature. Michael is known as a peace activist. \\"There are many definitions of war in different countries. According to my experience, I find that war is a type of disease that damages both body and soul and horribly distorts the images of people. I, myself am a product of two cultures, (Arab and Jewish), and to this day I do not understand the destructive power which has brought the two cultures to life and death confrontations. There is so much beauty and wisdom in the two cultures. It is so easy to be clever and give advice from afar, so hard to be wise and sane from within the flames.\\"Courrier International, France 2006 Michael established together with activists a movement against Meir Kahane (a Jewish advocate for banishment of Arabs from Israel, called \\"transfer\\") in Ma'alot, where he lived for 10 years (1982–1992) Michael was a partner in the struggle against the expulsion of Palestinian South Hebron Mountain cave dwellers: \\"The state of Israel was established thanks to international recognition which was granted following the holocaust and the deportations, stating that the Jewish people were entitled to establish a national home, where the proverbial wandering Jew and the refugee will find safe and secure habitat. This would be evil if we were to expel the caves inhabitants, if only because they don't have any defense or savior. The expulsion of these wretched people undermine our moral right to sit as free men and women in our secure homes in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa. There is abominable personal terror, but the use of militaristic power to banish citizens from their shacks and from their caves is no less abominable. Event at Tzavta Tel Aviv, 2002 In 2007 Michael, together with David Sasson, created the Forum of the peace initiative with Syria. The forum included Intellectuals, academics and business people such as Yaakov Peri, Amnon Lipikin Shahak and Alon Liel. An extract of the declaration composed by Michael: \\"We gave up Sinai and in return we gained peace with Egypt. We call upon the government of Israel, upon those amongst us who are responsible for designing policy, to listen to the voices that are making themselves heard from Damascus. Peace with Syria means peace with the region in which we live. The price of peace is much cheaper than the bitter and destructive price of war.\\" He has written extensively on social and political matters for Arabic and Hebrew newspapers and occasionally for foreign newspapers. His stance against stereotyping, prejudices and racism is also reflected in his novels. Even in his first novel, All Men are Equal – But Some are More (1974), he writes of these prejudices within Jewish society in Israel. The novel was influential for the second generation of the immigrants who saw Michael as a spiritual leader. The name of the book became a well- known saying. On the ever-widening social and economic gap in Israel, Sami Michael has said, : \\"This is dangerous shortsightedness. Poverty is a hot- house for the collapse of democracy and culture. Poverty is not a natural disaster. The rich need to understand that widespread poverty threatens, in essence, the existence of social-order. The most secured mansion with all its inhabitants, will not endure if the mansion is built in the center of a shantytown.\\" Ynet, December 5, 2004, interview with Michael as the president of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, for the International Human Rights Day, December 10. http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-3013884,00.html When the annual report of ACRI came out on International Human Rights Day, December 10, 2007, it noted: : \\"Author Sami Michael, the association's president, said upon the release of the report that racism was so rife it was damaging civil liberty in Israel. Israeli society is reaching new heights of racism that damages freedom of expression and privacy.\\"Haaretz, December 8, 2007, the report of The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), on racism toward International Human Rights Day, December 10. http://www.haaretz.com/news/civil-rights-group- israel-has-reached-new-heights-of-racism-1.234831 \\"A hundred years of conflict has given us a majority poisoned by ideological education –a racist majority even more extreme than its leadership.\\" 10. At the Hebrew Book Fair in Tel Aviv when Michael made a solitary demonstration against racism in Emanuel (a settlement town): : \\"Let's call a spade a spade: The lords of Emanuel are racists who imperil the values of Judaism and democracy. This separation fence of defilement, which shady rabbis plot to plant in our souls, must be uprooted… I will definitely demonstrate during the celebration of Hebrew Book Week, for a school is called 'the house of the book' in Hebrew… Every man, woman and teenager will be welcome to join me to extirpate the racist crime in Immanuel today – and should we remain silent, in all of Israel tomorrow.\\"Haaretz, June 2, 2010, this article is part of a special edition of Haaretz, to mark Israel's book week. http://www.haaretz.com/haaretz-authors- edition/the-colors-of-racism-1.293669 About the immigrant and foreigner: : \\"The fact that we are talking about Christians and Buddhists and those without religion does not negate from them the possibility to be helped as the poor of my city. How could we, as Jews that groaned under the evils of fascistic regimes, adopt the same fascistic measures towards those who are prepared to come here (Israel) to look after our sick and elderly and to strengthen our factories? And what about the children of these foreign workers that were born here and whose only language is Hebrew, they no longer have another homeland? And in whose name exactly are we entitled to trample on these people and their rights? We that claimed the right and the duty, to take care of the migrant, the orphan and the widow?\\" 10 For years Michael was a volunteer in the ERAN organization – an emotional/mental crisis hotline – Israel's only emotional first aid service provides a confidential 24-hour hotline, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Michael also lectures voluntarily in prisons to prisoners, both Jews and Arabs. In 1987 the Israeli High Court of Justice appointed Michael as arbitrator to decide on a matter of education and multiculturalism. The subject was widely covered in the press and his decision was a precedent in Israel which still stands. Michael is chairman of the council of AHI, the Council of Iraqi born Artists for encouragement of research, literature and art in Israel (Ramat-Gan). In the early 1990s, he was on the editorial staff of the Jewish Quarterly, published in London. In 1998, he was elected president of The Society for Solidarity between the People of Israel and the People of Iraq, a non-profit society founded by key public figures from cultural, academic and intellectual circles in Israeli society. The group, attracting much attention in Israel, the Arab world and elsewhere, stresses that a clear distinction ought to be made between the Iraqi oppressive regime and the Iraqi people, who have unjustifiably borne the horrifying consequences of the ongoing conflict in the region. The request of the group, however, to be registered as an official non-profit organization was denied by the Interior Ministry’s registrar, claiming that Israeli law forbids “contact with 'enemy states'.” In April 2003 the founders reestablished the Society. Michael was reelected as its president. In the same year after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, Michael was invited to join the group of composers of the new Iraqi constitution. As he did not reside in Iraq nor had he for many years, he felt that it would not be right. He did however have one request which was to insert one important clause: the defense of minorities. Michael has close relations with many Iraqis, both in Iraq and throughout the world. His novel Aida (2008) is set in Iraq in the days of Saddam Hussein. Friends from Iraq sent him up-to-date pictures of the country so that Michael could see the Iraq of today. He wrote thereon in the acknowledgements of the novel: \\"I will not forget the good people who extended me their help which was priceless, but I am not able to mention their names as it may put them in danger, amongst them university professors businessmen and women and journalists who risked their freedom to help, and where one of whom was actually arrested for this literary mission.\\" ==On religion, secularism, and Judaism== Sami Michael defines himself first of all as a Jew and only secondly as an Israeli. He comes from a secular Jewish family in Baghdad. \\"In the Jewish community in Iraq we lived in harmony, almost absolute between the religious and the secular. In Israel I demand the religious to respect my secularity. I have a personal permit to talk with my own personal god. For this I do not need the rabbinate.\\" -Unbounded Ideas Michael, an atheist, wrote on Judaism: \\"The Jewish religion is somewhat like a covenant between the people and godly justice, and at the same time constitutes a treaty of brotherhood and solidarity between people. Judaism has taken a dangerous route with the last generation in Israel). From within it an unbending nationalistic leadership has arisen that strives tirelessly to recruit the faith for clearly political goals. This leadership schemes to destroy the humane, spiritual side of the religion and use it as a weapon of war. Regrettably, this tendency is intensifying. In these times, Judaism, as a religion, is in desperate need of redemption. I had always thought that Judaism is a religion of compassion and grace, benevolence and of progress and freedom. Judaism is a religion where, at its very center, stands above all else the human being as a holy and superior entity. Life, all life, is supreme, even above good deeds and religious obligations. If freedom has meaning then mere attempts to free Judaism from its chains will be likened to a miracle. \\"The marriage between politics and religion is the most destructive marriage that could be, both to the state and to the religion. This marriage has brought corruption of the Jewish religion in Israel. You can see, for example, a rabbi who goes round with a pistol or an Uzi, and, in his opinion, he has the right to murder and kill without any judgment or judge, like Rabbi Moshe Levinger. Judaism originally is a religion of life, but here in Israel an elite of black suited men has been formed. The Jewish religion of every generation was never involved in the government and its intrigues. Joining the coalition since the beginning of the founding of the state and until today has ruined the religious establishment. More: : \\"If you define secularism according to the level of your struggle against the symbols of the religion, you become religious. I do not define my secularism by anti religious dimensions. I am not anti religious like the 'orthodox secular' in Israel who does not ask questions and who is just left with a shallow puddle of anti religiosity and in which he wallows. The highest degree of secularism is when a person becomes skeptic. The true secular has a daily dialogue between him and himself with questions about the creation, his relationship with his surroundings, and his relationship between him and other people in ==Works== ===Fiction=== *All Men are Equal – But Some are More (in Hebrew: Shavim ve-Shavim Yoter), novel, 1974 *Storm among the Palms, in Hebrew: Sufa ben ha-D'kalim, novel, 1975 *Refuge (in Hebrew: Hasut), novel, 1977 *A Handful of Fog (in Hebrew: Hofen shel Arafel ), novel, 1979 *Tin Shacks and Dreams (in Hebrew: Pahonim ve-Halomot ), novel, 1979 *A Trumpet in the Wadi (in Hebrew: Hatsotsrah ba-Wadi ), novel, 1987, *Love among the Palms (in Hebrew: Ahava ben ha-D'kalim), novel, 1990, *Victoria, novel, 1993, *Brown Devils (in Hebrew: Shedim Khumim), novel, 1993, *\\"The first day in Israel; in Haifa\\", short story, 1997 *The Third Wing (in Hebrew: Ha-Canaf Ha-Shlishit ), novelette, 2000, *Water Kissing Water (in Hebrew: Mayim Noshkim le-Mayim), novel, 2001, *Nabila (in Hebrew: Yonim be- Trafalgar), novel, 2005, sequel/dialogue to the novella Return to Haifa by Ghassan Kanafani, *Aida, novel, 2008 *The ABC go to the Sea (in Hebrew: Otiyot Holchot La-yam), children's book, 2009, *The Flight of the Swans (in Hebrew: Maof Ha-Barboorim), novel, 2011, . *Little Cricket Singing in the Rain (in Hebrew: Tzirtzaron Shar Gam Ba-Horef)children's book, 2012, *Diamond from the Wilderness (in Hebrew: Yahalom Min Ha-Yeshimon) novel, 2015, ===Non-fiction=== * Eleh Shivtei Yisrael: Shteim Esreh Sikhot al ha-She'elah ha-Edatit (These are the Tribes of Israel: Twelve Conversations on the Question of [Ethnic] Communities), 1984 * Gvulot ha-Ruakh: Sikhot im Ruvik Rozental (Unbounded Ideas: Ruvik Rosenthal talks with Sami Michael), 2000, * Ha-Khavayyah ha- Yisraelit (The Israeli Experience), 2001 ===Plays=== * Devils in the Basement, 1983– Haifa Theater * Twins, 1988 – Haifa Theater * He, 1999 – Tzavta Tel-Aviv ===Works translated by Michael=== Michael undertook two sizeable tasks of translation from Arabic, his mother tongue into Hebrew, his second language; the first being a trilogy by the Egyptian Nobel Prize laureate Naguib Mahfouz, Cairo Trilogy: Palace Walk (original Arabic title: Bein el-Qasrein, 1956), Palace of Desire (Qasr el-Shoaq, 1957), Sugar Street (El-Sukkareyya, 1957) This Hebrew translation was the first translation of the trilogy. It is part of the academic curriculum in Israel. In an interview with Imam Al-Chakim, the film director, Tuefik Salah, a close friend of Naguib Mahfouz, he spoke of his intimate relations between Mahfouz and three Israeli figures: two researchers and the author Sami Michael: : \\"The translation of the work of Mahfouz by Sami Michael into Hebrew, held great importance for Mahfouz, which he sees as a significant step that indicates the possibility of making peace and coexistence between the Arab world and Israel.

Leibniz thus hoped to create a language usable within the framework of a universal logical calculation or calculus ratiocinator. The characteristica universalis is a recurring concept in the writings of Leibniz. When writing in French, he sometimes employed the phrase spécieuse générale to the same effect. The concept is sometimes paired with his notion of a calculus ratiocinator and with his plans for an encyclopaedia as a compendium of all human knowledge. ==A universal pictographic language: the key to all the sciences== ===International communication=== Many Leibniz scholars writing in English seem to agree that he intended his characteristica universalis or \\"universal character\\" to be a form of pasigraphy, or ideographic language. This was to be based on a rationalised version of the 'principles' of Chinese characters, as Europeans understood these characters in the seventeenth century. From this perspective it is common to find the characteristica universalis associated with contemporary universal language projects like Esperanto, auxiliary languages like Interlingua, and formal logic projects like Frege's Begriffsschrift. The global expansion of European commerce in Leibniz's time provided mercantilist motivations for a universal language of trade so that traders could communicate with any natural language. Others, such as Jaenecke, for example, have observed that Leibniz also had other intentions for the characteristica universalis, and these aspects appear to be a source of the aforementioned vagueness and inconsistency in modern interpretations. According to Jaenecke, As Couturat wrote, Leibniz criticized the linguistic systems of George Dalgarno and John Wilkins for this reason since they focused on ===A universal language of science=== Leibniz said that his goal was an alphabet of human thought, a universal symbolic language (characteristic) for science, mathematics and metaphysics. According to Couturat, \\"In May 1676, he once again identified the universal language with the characteristic and dreamed of a language that would also be a calculus—a sort of algebra of thought\\" (1901, chp 3.). This characteristic was a universalisation of the various \\"real characteristics\\". Couturat wrote that Leibniz gave Egyptian and Chinese hieroglyphics and chemical signs as examples of real characteristics writing: In a footnote Couturat added: ===Metaphysics=== Hartley Rogers emphasised the metaphysical aspect of the characteristica universalis by relating it to the \\"elementary theory of the ordering of the reals,\\" defining it as \\"a precisely definable system for making statements of science\\" (Rogers 1963: 934). Universal language projects like Esperanto, and formal logic projects like Frege's Begriffsschrift are not commonly concerned with the epistemic synthesis of empirical science, mathematics, pictographs and metaphysics in the way Leibniz described. Hence scholars have had difficulty in showing how projects such as the Begriffsschrift and Esperanto embody the full vision Leibniz had for his characteristica. The writings of Alexander Gode suggested that Leibniz' characteristica had a metaphysical bias which prevented it from reflecting reality faithfully. Gode emphasized that Leibniz established certain goals or functions first, and then developed the characteristica to fulfill those functions. ===Science=== In the domain of science, Leibniz aimed for his characteristica to form diagrams or pictures, depicting any system at any scale, and understood by all regardless of native language. Leibniz wrote: P. P. Weiner raised an example of a large scale application of Leibniz's characteristica to climatic science. A weather-forecaster invented by Athanasius Kircher \\"interested Leibniz in connection with his own attempts to invent a universal language\\" (1940). Leibniz talked about his dream of a universal scientific language at the very dawn of his career, as follows: Nicholas Rescher, reviewing Cohen's 1954 article, wrote that: Near the end of his life, Leibniz wrote that combining metaphysics with mathematics and science through a universal character would require creating what he called: The universal \\"representation\\" of knowledge would therefore combine lines and points with \\"a kind of pictures\\" (pictographs or logograms) to be manipulated by means of his calculus ratiocinator. He hoped his pictorial algebra would advance the scientific treatment of qualitative phenomena, thereby constituting \\"that science in which are treated the forms or formulas of things in general, that is, quality in general\\" (On Universal Synthesis and Analysis, 1679, in Loemker 1969: 233). ===His diagrammatic reasoning=== Basic elements of Leibniz's pictograms. Since the characteristica universalis is diagrammatic and employs pictograms (see picture), the diagrams in Leibniz's work warrant close study. On at least two occasions, Leibniz illustrated his philosophical reasoning with diagrams. One diagram, the frontispiece to his 1666 De Arte Combinatoria (On the Art of Combinations), represents the Aristotelian theory of how all material things are formed from combinations of the elements earth, water, air, and fire. Leibniz's diagrammatic reasoning. These four elements make up the four corners of a diamond (see picture). Opposing pairs of these are joined by a bar labeled \\"contraries\\" (earth-air, fire-water). At the four corners of the superimposed square are the four qualities defining the elements. Each adjacent pair of these is joined by a bar labeled \\"possible combination\\"; the diagonals joining them are labeled \\"impossible combination\\". Starting from the top, fire is formed from the combination of dryness and heat; air from wetness and heat; water from coldness and wetness; earth from coldness and dryness. This diagram is reproduced in several texts including Saemtliche Schriften und Briefe (Saemtliche Schriften und Briefe, Reihe VI, Band 1: 166, Loemker 1969: 83, 366, Karl Popp and Erwin Stein 2000: 33). ===Leibniz loses will=== Leibniz rightly saw that creating the characteristica would be difficult, fixing the time required for devising it as follows: \\"I think that some selected men could finish the matter in five years\\" (Loemker 1969: 224), later remarking: \\"And so I repeat, what I have often said, that a man who is neither a prophet nor a prince can ever undertake any thing of greater good to mankind of more fitting for divine glory\\" (Loemker 1969: 225). But later in life, a more sober note emerged. In a March 1706 letter to the Electress Sophia of Hanover, the spouse of his patron, he wrote: In another 1714 letter to Nicholas Remond, he wrote: ==Three criteria== C. J. Cohen (1954) set out three criteria which any project for a philosophical language would need to meet before it could be considered a version of the characteristica universalis. In setting out these criteria, Cohen made reference to the concept of \\"logistic\\". This concept is not the same as that used in statistical analysis. In 1918, Clarence Irving Lewis, the first English-speaking logician to translate and discuss some of Leibniz's logical writings, elaborated on \\"logistic\\" as follows: Following from this Cohen stipulated that the universal character would have to serve as: *An \\"international auxiliary language\\" enabling persons speaking different languages to communicate with one another; *Symbolism for the exact and systematic expression of all present knowledge, making possible a \\"logistic\\" treatment of science in general. This symbolism could also be expanded to accommodate future knowledge; *An instrument of discovery and demonstration. These criteria together with the notion of logistic reveal that Cohen and Lewis both associated the characteristica with the methods and objectives of general systems theory. ==A common scientific language== Inconsistency, vagueness, and a lack of specifics in both English language translations and modern English language interpretations of Leibniz's writings render a clear exposition difficult. As with Leibniz's calculus ratiocinator two different schools of philosophical thought have come to emphasise two different aspects that can be found in Leibniz's writing. The first point of view emphasizes logic and language, and is associated with analytic philosophy and rationalism. The second point of view is more in tune with Couturat's views as expressed above, which emphasize science and engineering. This point of view is associated with synthetic philosophy and empiricism. Either or both of these aspects Leibniz hoped would guide human reasoning like Ariadne's thread and thereby suggest solutions to many of humanity's urgent problems. ==Gödel alleges conspiracy== Because Leibniz never described the characteristica universalis in operational detail, many philosophers have deemed it an absurd fantasy. In this vein, Parkinson wrote: The logician Kurt Gödel, on the other hand, believed that the characteristica universalis was feasible, and that its development would revolutionize mathematical practice (Dawson 1997). He noticed, however, that a detailed treatment of the characteristica was conspicuously absent from Leibniz's publications. It appears that Gödel assembled all of Leibniz's texts mentioning the characteristica, and convinced himself that some sort of systematic and conspiratorial censoring had taken place, a belief that became obsessional. Gödel may have failed to appreciate the magnitude of the task facing the editors of Leibniz's manuscripts, given that Leibniz left about 15,000 letters and 40,000 pages of other manuscripts. Even now, most of this huge Nachlass remains unpublished. ==Related 17th century projects== Others in the 17th century, such as George Dalgarno, attempted similar philosophical and linguistic projects, some under the heading of mathesis universalis. A notable example was John Wilkins, the author of An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language, who wrote a thesaurus as a first step towards a universal language. He intended to add to his thesaurus an alphabet of human thought (an organisational scheme, similar to a thesaurus or the Dewey decimal system), and an \\"algebra of thought,\\" allowing rule-based manipulation. The philosophers and linguists who undertook such projects often belonged to pansophical (universal knowledge) and scientific knowledge groups in London and Oxford, collectively known as the \\"Invisible College\\" and now seen as forerunners of the Royal Society. ==More recent projects== A wide variety of constructed languages have emerged over the past 150 years which appear to support many of Leibniz's intuitions. If indeed they do support Leibniz's vision of unified science, then the remaining question is whether Ariadne's unifying thread can be discerned among these various projects, leading to their integration. * Raymond F. Piper (1957; 432-433) claimed that O.L. Reiser's Unified Symbolism for World Understanding in Science (1955), an expansion of his A Philosophy for World Unification (1946), was inspired by Leibniz's characteristica universalis, and believed necessary for world understanding and unbiased communications so that \\"war may eventually be eliminated and that a worldwide organism of peaceful human beings may gradually be established\\" (Piper Ibid.). * The study of Boolean algebras and group theory in the 19th century proved correct Leibniz's intuition that algebraic methods could be used to reason about qualitative and non-numerical phenomena. Specifically, the members of the universal set of a Boolean algebra or group need not be numbers. Moreover, a fair bit of philosophy and theoretical science can be formalized as axiomatic theories embodying first-order logic and set theory. Note also how model theory has been employed to formalize and reason about such emphatically nonnumerical subjects as semantics and pragmatics of natural languages. But these approaches have yet to result in any pictographic notations. * Fearnley-Sander (1986) went one step further, defining Leibniz's characteristica as a combination of the algebra of logic (which Fearnley-Sander defined as the calculus ratiocinator) and the algebra of geometry (defined as the characteristica geometrica). Fearnley-Sander suggested that this combination had \\"come to pass\\" with the rise of universal algebra. Some people other than Fearnley-Sander working in the area of \\"universal algebra,\\" the study of the mathematical and logical properties of algebraic structures generally, do not believe that universal algebra has anything to do with the characteristica. * Palko, Gy Bulcsu (1986) considered structured analysis for analyzing and designing hierarchic systems by using an iconic language, and suggested that such was an application of the universal characteristics Leibniz's project to the language of structured analysis and the formalization of an iconic control system. * Kluge (1980) argued that Frege's landmark Begriffsschrift was consciously inspired by the characteristica universalis. * Even though Charles Sanders Peirce, a founder of semiotics, believed that all reasoning was diagrammatic, the relation, if any, of the characteristica to his existential graphs and to semiotics has yet to be explored in the English literature. * Several aspects of logical positivism, specifically: ** The first-order theories of Rudolf Carnap's Aufbau (1928, English translation 1967) and of its successor, Goodman (1977), are Leibnizian in their sweep and ambition, although Leibniz would have taken strenuous exception to Carnap's resolute hostility to all metaphysics. ** The unification of science movement of the 1930s, led by Otto Neurath, Rudolf Carnap, and Charles W. Morris, and later by Edward Haskell et al., bears comparison with the characteristica. ** Otto Neurath's isotype pictogram system, and \\"international picture language.\\" * The following attempts to recast parts of theoretical science as axiomatic first-order theories can be viewed as attempts to develop parts of the characteristica: **Special relativity, by Hans Reichenbach, Rudolf Carnap, and others during the 1920s (Carnap 1958: 197-212); ** Biology, by Joseph Woodger (1937), also during the 1930s (Carnap 1958: 213-20): ** Mechanics, by Suppes (1957: 291-305) and others during the 1950s. * The objectives of the 'Symbolator' or 'idea-computer' (Goppold 1994) resemble in some respects a less ambitious version of the characteristica universalis. * Connections with the Jewish Cabbala, and the International auxiliary language policy of the Baháʼí Faith have also been made. * The characteristic has also been claimed as an ancestor of the pictographic Energy Systems Language and associated Emergy Synthesis of Odum's Systems Ecology (Cevolatti and Maud, 2004). The Energy Systems Language combines lines and points with \\"a kind of pictures\\" manipulated by means of digital computers and software packages like EXTEND (Odum, Odum, and Peterson 1995), and Valyi's Emergy Simulator. It was designed to provide a general systems language affording quantitative accounting and mathematical simulation of qualitative energy relationships between ecological entities: \\"that science in which are treated the forms or formulas of things in general, that is, quality in general\\". A general algebra known as the emergy algebra emerged from the repeated use of this language in modelling and simulating the energetic principles of ecological relations. In particular it afforded the discovery and demonstration of the maximum power principle, suggested as the fourth law of thermodynamics. If this ancestral claim is granted, then simulation software like EXTEND and Valyi's Emergy Simulator can be seen as combining the characteristica and the calculus ratiocinator, if and only if the digital computer is interpreted as a physical embodiment of the calculus ratiocinator. * The work of Mario Bunge on the border of physics and metaphysics seems grounded in metaphysical presuppositions similar to those of Leibniz's characteristica (Radnitzky 1981: 246). * Jacob Linzbach's Transcendent Algebra, a pasigraphy designed to allow the \\"calculation of truth\\" through manipulation of given facts following basic principles much like those used in mathematics, was inspired by Leibniz's characteristica. * Lojban (and its older version Loglan) are both artificial languages derived from predicate logic, and intended for use in human communication. *Charles K. Bliss's Blissymbols or Blissymbolics, presently used as an 'alternative and augmentative language' for disabled people but originally intended as an International 'Auxlang', is said to be in the mold of the characteristica (Bliss 1978). * Ithkuil is a constructed language created by John Quijada, designed to express deeper levels of human cognition briefly yet overtly and clearly, particularly with regard to human categorization. ==Notes== ==References== On Leibniz's lifelong interest in the characteristica and the like, see the following texts in Loemker (1969): 165-66, 192-95, 221-28, 248-50, and 654-66\\\\.

Under the Childers Reforms the regiment amalgamated with the 87th (Royal Irish Fusiliers) Regiment of Foot to form the Princess Victoria's (Royal Irish Fusiliers) in 1881. ==History== ===Formation=== Lord Blayney who commanded the 2nd Battalion at the Battle of Fuengirola in October 1810 The regiment was raised in Dublin by Major- General William Crosbie as the 89th Regiment of Foot, in response to the threat posed by the French Revolution, on 3 December 1793. The regiment was sent to join the Duke of York's army in the Netherlands in summer 1794 as part of the unsuccessful defence of that country against the Republican French during the Flanders Campaign. It was posted to Ireland and, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Blayney, it saw action at the Battle of Vinegar Hill in June 1798 during the rebellion. The regiment became known for its perseverance in hunting down Irish rebels earning the nickname \\"Blayney's Bloodhounds\\". It was posted to Malta in 1800 and arrived in Egypt in March 1801 for service in the Egyptian Campaign. It saw action at the Battle of Alexandria later that month at the Siege of Cairo in April 1801. ===Napoleonic Wars=== The Battle of Fuengirola, where men from the 2nd Battalion undertook a bayonet charge, in October 1810 A second battalion was raised in Ireland in August 1804. The 1st Battalion embarked for Hanover in December 1805 but lost its colours in a storm off Holland. After service in Germany the battalion returned to England in February 1806. The battalion sailed for South America in spring 1807 and took part in the disastrous expedition under Sir Home Popham. It sailed for the Cape of Good Hope later that year and then transferred to Ceylon in 1808. It took part in the Invasion of Isle de France in November 1810, the Invasion of Java in August 1811 and the Invasion of Sumatra in March 1812. It transferred to Madras in India in 1815 and re- absorbed the 2nd Battalion in November 1816. Meanwhile, four companies from the 2nd Battalion embarked for Cádiz in October 1810 for service in the Peninsular War. Under the command of Lord Blayney, the four companies of the 2nd battalion took part in a bayonet charge at the Battle of Fuengirola in October 1810. After defeat in the battle Lord Blayney and most of his troops were held as prisoners of war for the next four years. Monument commemorating the Battle of Crysler's Farm in November 1813 One company from the battalion embarked for North America in summer 1812 for service in the War of 1812. It saw action at the Raid on Black Rock in July 1813 and the Battle of Crysler's Farm November 1813. At Crysler's Farm the men of the 2nd Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Morrison, rose up out of concealment and opened fire on the attacking American Forces. The Americans dived behind tree stumps and bushes to return fire, and their attack lost all order and momentum. As ammunition ran short, they began to retreat out of line.Zaslow, p. 76 The battalion went on to fight at the Battle of Buffalo in December 1813. At Buffalo, the men of the 2nd Battalion scored an early success when they drove off the American piquet at Conjunckaty Creek and captured the bridge and the battery there.Quimby, p. 359 The men of the 2nd Battalion also fought at the Battle of Longwoods in March 1814. They were less successful at Longwoods: Captain James Basden of the 2nd Battalion led a charge against the American position. As the British troops advanced towards a bridge, bunched into a column by the narrow road, the Americans poured a withering fire into them, mowing down the leading troops.Zaslow, p. 138 After the British troops had crossed the bridge, Basden was wounded in the leg, and his men fell back into a ravine where the Americans fired on them from a height and inflicted heavy casualties.Zaslow, p. 139 The men from the 2nd Battalion also saw action at the Battle of Lundy's Lane in July 1814 and the Siege of Fort Erie in August 1814 before embarking for home in June 1815. ===The Victorian era=== The regiment, still in India, fought the Pindaris in 1817 and was deployed to Burma in 1824 for service in the First Anglo-Burmese War: it formed part of an army which advanced up the River Irrawaddy to the Kingdom of Ava. It returned to India arriving in Madras in 1826 and to England in 1831. It embarked for the West Indies in 1835 and went on to Canada before returning home in 1847. It sailed for Gibraltar in 1854 and then saw action at the Siege of Sevastopol in winter 1854 during the Crimean War. It transferred to the Cape Colony in 1855 to protect British interests there while the cattle-killing movement was at its height before embarking for India in 1857 to help suppress the Indian Rebellion. It returned home in August 1865 and became the 89th (The Princess Victoria's) Regiment of Foot in May 1866. It returned to India in 1870 and was deployed to Rangoon in Burma in 1876 before going back to India in 1880. As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 89th was linked with the 94th Regiment of Foot and assigned to district no. 65 at Gough Barracks in Armagh. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 87th (Royal Irish Fusiliers) Regiment of Foot to form the Princess Victoria's (Royal Irish Fusiliers). ==Battle honours== Battle honours won by the regiment were: *Napoleonic Wars: Egypt (Sphinx superscribed \\"Egypt\\"), Java *American war of 1812: Niagara *Anglo-Burmese Wars: Ava *Crimean War: Sevastopol ==Colonels of the Regiment== Colonels of the Regiment were: === 89th Regiment of Foot=== *1793–1795: Maj-Gen.

It contains three similar species, the green heron or green-backed heron, Butorides virescens, the lava heron (Butorides sundevalli), and the striated heron, Butorides striatus. A fossil species, Butorides validipes, is known from the Early Pleistocene of Florida in the United States. Butorides is from Middle English Butor \\"bittern\\" and Ancient Greek -oides, \\"resembling\\". Adults of both extant species are about 44 cm (17 inches) long, and have a blue-black back and wings, a black cap and short yellow legs. Juveniles are browner above and streaked below, and have greenish-yellow legs. The species have different underpart colours, chestnut with a white line down the front in green heron, and white or grey in striated. Both breed in small wetlands on a platform of sticks often in shrubs or trees, sometimes on the ground. The female lays three to five eggs. Both parents incubate for about 20 days until hatching, and feed the young birds which take a further three weeks to fledge. Butorides herons stand still at the water's edge and wait to ambush prey. They mainly eat small fish, frogs and aquatic insects. They sometimes drop food on the water's surface to attract fish. ==Taxonomy and range== The Butorides herons were formerly considered one species, but are now normally split as above, with the green heron breeding in eastern North America, Central America, the West Indies and the Pacific coast of Canada and the United States, and striated heron in the Old World tropics from west Africa to Japan, and in South America. Birds in central Panama with buff necks have been considered to be hybrids between the two species, but the occurrence of similar birds beyond the range of migratory green herons means that there is still doubt about the species' limits of the Butorides herons. ==References== * A guide to the birds of Costa Rica (1989), by F.

He received his Bachelor of Science in 1949, and a PhD in 1957. He taught for thirty years at the University of Melbourne, from 1962 to 1992, influencing several generations of Victorian botanists and foresters. His professional expertise ranged from angiosperms, pteridophytes, bryophytes, lichens and fungi. He was also able to synthesise many biological problems ecologically, especially in Mountain Ash forests including geology, plant and animal species interactions, the effects of fire and climate, insect and seed dispersal. He wrote more than 200 scientific articles in over 20 publications. Since 2000, 'The David Ashton Biodiversity and Ecosystems Award' has been awarded annually for the best Victorian ecological research.

The concerto for solo tenor trombone and large orchestra, written in 1989, is sometimes called Motorbike Concerto. It was dedicated to the trombone virtuoso Christian Lindberg. The piece is meant to be a musical telling of a modern Odysseus, traveling the world with his trombone. == Orchestration == The orchestration is complex, calling for a large orchestra with additional piano, harp, full percussion section and virtuoso metal plate striker. The solo part, at almost 24 minutes in length, is highly complex, spanning the bass, tenor, and treble clefs and calling for considerable extended technique. == The performance == Lindberg's world premiere serves as the guideline for how the piece should be performed. The audience sits facing the stage and the orchestra tuning. Suddenly, there is a loud engine sound, and a white motorcycle rolls onto the stage, driven by Lindberg. He is dressed in full, light red leathers and generally makes a very impressive sight. Wasting no time, the orchestra begins with haunting chords, shrieking lower and lower, and the concerto begins. In the first movement, the soloist imitates the sound of a motorcycle changing gears. The extended trombone technique of flutter tonguing is used in combination with a plunger mute to create this effect. As the trombone section takes over this sound, the soloist shifts into a complicated passage of very high, and very fast notes. This eventually subsides into the cessation of the soloist's playing, as he physically draws out the parts of the globe with his trombone slide. Movement two is an evocation of the Florida Everglades. The soloist begins by playing the \\"crocodile chorus\\", a multiphonic passage that requires the soloist to produce chords with the trombone, as well as sing. This section also includes growling sounds, and other various extended trombone techniques. Movement three suggests a motorcycle race through French Provence during a Christian procession. It includes more motorcycle sounds, this time with the soloist playing along with the entire trombone section. Eventually the upper winds start playing a religious-sounding melody, and the soloist plays very lightly in the background, the sound of a motorcycle. Though it is the sound of a distant machine, the tones harmonize with the procession music. Eventually the soloist plays a countermelody against the processional music. The movement ends with the soloist playing a very high and loud note until his air is gone. Then he sucks in with a deathly sound and begins the next movement. Movement four is based on the sounds of aboriginal tribes and the desert of Australia. It is essentially a long, virtuoso trombone solo played in imitation of the didgeridoo. The soloist plays a pedal B-flat, and sings an F, a twelfth higher. This, combined with different articulations, screams and occasional harmonic changes, creates a sound resembling didgeridoo. The movement ends with another gasp for air. Movement five is the finale. It begins with a slightly altered version of the \\"Crocodile Chorus\\", and recaps the various other movements of the piece. It ends with the soloist flutter tonguing a very loud note while spinning around in circles. This creates a sinusoidal sound effect, with a rising and falling volume. The soloist takes one last gasp for air and harmonizes with the orchestra on a final note that fades into silence. == References == * Sandström, Jan.
