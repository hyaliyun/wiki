The coronavirus pandemic has had a major impact on fashion brands worldwide. At the same time, the fashion industry faces challenges in consumer demand. New opportunities are also presenting themselves as fashion brands shift to making fashionable coronavirus face masks. ==Manufacturing== Manufacturing issues include lack of fabric availability and order cancellations, but brands that prepared originally by importing fabrics and have them stored at a safehouse will benefit from the pandemic. ==Sales== Apparel is a leading discretionary purchase. As many people are staying at home, there is less emphasis on getting dressed. Likewise, many people make clothing purchases ahead of special occasions, such as weddings and vacation, but as many of these events have been canceled or postponed, the impetus to buy new clothing is no longer there. Layoffs, furloughs and pay cuts are also affecting sales. ==Events== Designers have adapted with producing and showcasing their fashion products by streaming presentations online without a live audience present. The British Fashion Council made an announcement in April 2020 that it would develop a digital ‚Äúcultural fashion week platform‚Äù that designers could use in any way that they thought would work for them rather than facilitating the typical format and setting of a fashion show. Shanghai and Moscow fashion weeks were presented digitally in late March and April 2020. Ermenegildo Zegna coined the word \\"phygital\\" to describe \\"physical space and digital technologies\\" as its new way of showcasing fashion. As art galleries and museums are closed, First American Art Magazine organized a virtual art exhibition and asked the Native art community to submit masks. More than seventy artists handed in 125 masks, from functional masks to decorated ones. == Face masks == Face masks have been trending as a fashion statement during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been suggested that possibly \\"no other piece of clothing that has had a trajectory like face masks ‚Äî something that began as purely protective transforming into a fashion statement in no time at all.\\" Trikini, a three piece garment was popularized in Italy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The trikini consists of a two piece beachwear and a matching mask. ==Distribution channels== As retail stores shut their doors and stay-at-home orders kept people inside, there was a dramatic shift towards digital commerce that is likely to continue post-pandemic. Consumers had to increase their use of services like social commerce and curbside pickup and retailers had to offer digital solutions in order to survive . Sales from physical brick-and-mortar stores and department stores are down and expected to continue decreasing while direct-to-consumer online retailers are on the rise . ==Lasting effects== The COVID-19 pandemic will inevitably change the fashion industry forever. The necessity to purchase clothing on a frequent basis no longer exists, and the financial and cultural devastation which took place when numerous brands and historical department stores closed for good. As time goes on, the catastrophic effects of the Coronavirus on small fashion businesses will become clear, what can be expected for certain is a sort of dynamic shift which is expected to occur in terms of production and collection cycles, what styles are produced (as well as where & how often) and most importantly, who will be the ones in power to make these decisions. == References == fashion industry Category:History of fashion Category:Clothing Category:Jewellery Category:Shoe business ","title":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the fashion industry"},{"id":"63890765","text":"D√©borah Bourch'his is a French researcher in Epigenetics.

Kidder (n√©e Clarke; 1855 ‚Äì 1920) was a college librarian at Oregon Agricultural College, now Oregon State University, and nicknamed ‚ÄúMother Kidder‚Äù by many students. == Early life and education == Ida Angeline Clarke was born in 1855 in Auburn, New York. Following the death of her husband, she attended both the New York Normal School at Albany and the University of Illinois, finishing her education in 1906. From there, Kidder moved to Washington where she worked at the Washington State Library at Olympia before continuing on to Corvallis, Oregon where she began work at Oregon State Library on the campus of Oregon Agricultural College. == Oregon Agricultural College == Kidder began work at Oregon Agricultural College in 1908, and upon arrival was asked to take account of the current library collections by the then university president, William Jasper Kerr. She tallied 7,180 general and reference books, 5,000 government documents, as well as approximately 10,000 pamphlets. These collections were housed in the Benton Hall Administration Building, eventually occupying the whole of the second floor. In 1917, Kidder and the student community lobbied for a new library building, which was approved by the OAC Board of Regents and the 1917 Oregon Legislative Assembly, allotting $158,000 for the project. The 57,000 square foot building was completed in 1918 and books were moved into the new library from Benton Hall by faculty and students due to a wartime labor shortage. While at OAC, Kidder spent years organizing, arranging, and expanding the library's collections as well as increasing staff numbers from one person to nine. == Community and professional involvement == In 1914, Ida Kidder was one of the speakers at the Oregon State Convention of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Association; she gave a talk on \\"The Proper Literature for Children.\\" In her talk, she gave advice to both teachers and parents on how book impacted a child's psychology and understanding of the world. Kidder gave a talk at the Pacific Northwest Library Association in 1917; her topic was \\"Libraries and Inspiration.\\" Other speakers addressed how World War I was impacting service, how to gather loan statistics from public libraries, and budget concerns. She donated money to the First Baptist Church fund in 1916, which was gathering contributions to the American Armenian Relief Fund. In 1917, she twice donated to a fund to support Belgian children to the Progressive Business Men's Club of Portland, which was raising money through waste-paper collection and sale, as well as subscriptions to the organization, to give to the Patriotic Conservation League. She served as a hospital librarian for the summer of 1918 at Camp Lewis, near Tacoma, Washington. == Death == Kidder suffered a heart attack in November 1919 and lost much of her mobility, leading engineering students to create the ‚ÄúWicker Mobile‚Äù for her, a small electric cart which she drove around campus. She died on February 29, 1920 due to a brain hemorrhage. Kidder Hall, the old library building built in 1918 and which sits across from the current Valley Library, was named in her honor in 1963. Additionally, her ghost is said to haunt the fourth floor of Waldo Hall, her campus residence. == References == Category:1855 births Category:1920 deaths Category:American librarians Category:Women librarians Category:People from New York (state) Category:People from Oregon Category:Oregon State University people ","title":"Ida Kidder"},{"id":"63890788","text":"MK Alam Chowdhury is a Jatiya Party (Ershad) politician and the former Member of Parliament of Nilphamari-3. ==Career== Chowdhury was elected to parliament from Nilphamari-3 as a Jatiya Party candidate in 1988. ==References== Category:Jatiya Party politicians Category:Living people Category:4th Jatiya Sangsad members Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"MK Alam Chowdhury"},{"id":"63890798","text":"L√º Wei (, 1966 ‚Äì 9 May 1990) was a Chinese diver who competed in women's 10-metre platform. ==Career== She was the gold medalist at the 1982 Asian Games, 1983 Summer Universiade, 1985 Summer Universiade, 1986 Asian Games, and 1987 Summer Universiade.

The first edition was published 1983 by the National Geographic Society. There have subsequently been six additional editions. The book contains information on the identification, geographic distribution, habitat preference, and vocalizations. Each species account is presented on the left, while respective illustrations are adjacently on the right page. == Editions == === First edition (1983) === The first edition of National Geographic's legacy field contained just over 800 accounts. It was one of the first widely known bird field guides, printing 325,000 copies of the first edition over the course of three years. === Second edition (1987) === Jon L. Dunn and Eirik A. T. Blom served as chief consultants for the second edition, with art contributions from 17 artists. Blom also served as the map compiler. It contains 464 pages with over 800 species accounts. === Third edition (1999) === Jon L. Dunn, Jonathan Alderfer, and Paul E. Lehman were the primary consultants for the third edition. Its 480 pages contain 80 new species, as a result of new records and taxonomic updates. Other updates include new information on identification methods, distribution, and plumage variation, in addition to revised distribution maps, and new illustrations. === Fourth edition (2002) === The fourth edition was edited by Jon L. Dunn, Jonathan Alderfer, Paul Lehman, and Mary Dickinson. It consists of 480 pages. One of the fourth edition's significant updates was the addition of 250 revised range maps. Other updates included revisions to plumage and taxonomy information, new illustrations, and a new quick-find index system. === Fifth edition (2007) === The fifth edition was edited by Jon L. Dunn and Jonathan Alderfer, with colored plates from 20 artists. It is composed of 504 pages and contains accounts for 967 species of birds. The fifth edition involved the addition of thumb-tabs for general bird families such as hawks, sandpipers, warblers, etc. The fifth addition also incorporates an accidental species list. This section includes 67 species that have occurred in North America fewer than three times in the past two decades or five times in the last century or that are extinct. There is also an appendix with summaries of the birds of Greenland and Bermuda. === Sixth edition (2011) === The sixth edition was edited by Jon L. Dunn and Jonathan Alderfer, with colored plates contributed by 21 artists. It is 576 pages long and contains accounts for 990 species, 26 of which newly add in this version. The accidental species list at the end was increased to 92 accounts. The sixth edition also includes maps for 59 birds with multiple subspecies. === Seventh (current) edition (2017) === The seventh edition was edited by Jon L. Dunn and Jonathan Alderfer, with map editing done by Paul Lehman. It contains 592 pages and every species recorded in North America up until 2016. This most recently updated version contains 37 new species accounts, 80 new maps, 350 map revisions, and approximately 300 new illustrations. One of the most significant edits is the update of illustrations for North American hummingbirds. == Other National Geographic bird resources == In addition to their popular National Geographic Field Guide to Birds of North America, National Geographic released a number of related guides. === National Geographic Complete Birds of North America === In 2005, National Geographic and Alderfer produced the first edition of National Geographic Complete Birds of North America. This book is marketed as a \\"companion to\\" the organization's regular field guides. It is effectively acts as a reference book, but not as a field guide due to its size. In addition to the information in the regular field guides, this expansion contains family introductions, addition information in the species accounts, and in depth identification techniques for hard to identify species. The second edition was released in 2014. === National Geographic regional guides === National Geographic has also released a number of region-specific guides. Dunn and Alderfer helped National Geographic publish National Geographic Field Guide to the Birds of Eastern North America and National Geographic Field Guide to the Birds of Western North America in 2008. The organization also produced a number of state-specific guides. Among them include guides for Pennsylvania (Alderfer 2006), Colorado (Alderfer 2006), Washington and Oregon (combined) (Alderfer 2006), Texas (Alderfer 2005), Michigan (Mel Baughman 2005), Florida (Baughman 2005), Arizona and New Mexico (combined) (Alderfer 2006), New Jersey (Baughman 2005), California (Baughman 2005), and North and South Carolina (combined) (Alderfer 2005). === Other National Geographic bird guides === In 2013, National Geographic, with Laura Erickson and Alderfer, published National Geographic Pocket Guide to the Birds of North America. Smaller than the regular National Geographic field guide, this reduced the guide to only 192 pages, 160 of which are devoted to North America's most common species. This differs from the standard written description on the left page and illustration on the right page. Instead, each species gets one full page. National Geographic, with Alderfer, Paul Hess, and Noah Strycker, also published National Geographic Backyard Guide to the Birds of North America in 2011. A second edition was released in 2019. Like the pocket guide, this guide is 256 pages and outlines the 150 most common yard birds in North America. It also contains several tips and tricks about creating a bird-friendly yard. == References == Category:Birding and birdwatching Category:Birds of the United States Category:Birds Category:Birds of North America Category:National Geographic Society publications Category:Ornithology ","title":"National Geographic Field Guide to Birds of North America"},{"id":"63890881","text":"Dionne Tonna (born 26 September 1983) is a Maltese former footballer who played as a midfielder.

The compound had not been properly isolated as of 2010, due to its tendency to polymerize. However, removal of three protons yields the melonate (formerly hydromelonate) anion , whose salts are stable and have been known since the 19th century. Removal of only two protons yields the divalent hydrogenmelonate anion . ==History== In 1834 Justus von Liebig described the compounds that he named melamine, melam, and melon. In 1835 Leopold Gmelin prepared a potassium salt (later identified as ) by heating potassium ferrocyanide with sulfur); recognizing their connection to the compounds described by Liebig, he named the salt \\"hydromelonate\\" and the corresponding acid \\"hydromelonic\\". In the following years Liebig prepared the same salt by other methods,such as by fusing potassium thiocyanate with antimony trichloride, and eventually determined the formula for the acid. The correct structure for the cation was published in 1937 by Linus Pauling and J. H. Sturdivant. Starting in the 1970s, melonates have attracted new interest, motivated by research in cubic carbon nitride c-. Salts of many cations have been synthesized and studied, including mixed-cation salts and calcium hydrogenmelonate . The structure of potassium melonate pentahydrate was elucidated only in 2005. ==Preparation== Sodium and potassium melonates are still routinely prepared by variations of one of Liebig's methods, namely by reacting melon with molten potassium thiocyanate, potassium cyanate, orsodium thiocyanate. Other salts can be prepared by double displacement reactions. ==Melonates== Melonate anion . Alkali melonates are soluble in water without decomposition. Treatment of melonates with alkali gives salts of cyameluric acid. Potassium melonate pentahydrate has planar sheets of melonate anions with potassium cations between the layers. The same generals structure is seen in the anhydrous salt (except that the melonate ions are asymmetric due to an group being turned by 180¬∞) and in the salts and . Melonate salts decompose when melted with cyanates to form tricyanomelaminates, the first selective decomposition reaction leading from heptazines to triazines. Pyrolysis of iron(III) melonate at very high temperature yields carbon in the form of nanotubes. ==See also== *Melem, *Cyameluric acid, ==References== J. Liebig, Ibid., 10, 1 (1834). L. Gmelin, Ann.

Buddhist Philosophy and Its European Parallels. Philosophy East and West 13, p.9-23, no.1, January 1963. University press of Hawaii. The Pyrrhonian Skeptics' goal of ataraxia (the state of being untroubled) is a soteriological goal similar to nirvana. These similarities can be traced back to the origins of Pyrrhonism. Pyrrho, the founder of Pyrrhonism, spent about 18 months in Taxila as part of the court of Alexander the Great's conquest of the east where he studied Indian philosophy and presumably encountered Early Buddhism. Centuries later Pyrrhonism may have influenced the Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka philosophy. ==Mutual influences between Buddhism and Pyrrhonism== === Buddhist influences on Pyrrho === Map of Alexander the Great's empire and the route he and Pyrrho took to India Diogenes La√´rtius' biography of Pyrrho reports that Pyrrho traveled with Alexander the Great's army to India and based his philosophy on what he learned there: > ...he even went as far as the Gymnosophists, in India, and the Magi. Owing > to which circumstance, he seems to have taken a noble line in philosophy, > introducing the doctrine of incomprehensibility, and of the necessity of > suspending one's judgment.... The Pyrrhonists promote suspending judgment (epoch√©) about dogma (beliefs about non-evident matters) as the way to reach ataraxia. This is similar to the Buddha's refusal to answer certain metaphysical questions which he saw as non-conductive to the path of Buddhist practice and Nagarjuna's \\"relinquishing of all views (drsti)\\". A summary of Pyrrho's philosophy was preserved by Eusebius in Praeparatio evangelica, quoting Aristocles, quoting the Pyrrhonist philosopher Timon, quoting his teacher, Pyrrho, in what is known as the \\"Aristocles passage.\\" > \\"Whoever wants to live well (eudaimonia) must consider these three > questions: First, how are pragmata (ethical matters, affairs, topics) by > nature? Secondly, what attitude should we adopt towards them? Thirdly, what > will be the outcome for those who have this attitude?\\" Pyrrho's answer is > that \\"As for pragmata they are all adiaphora (undifferentiated by a logical > differentia), astathmƒìta (unstable, unbalanced, not measurable), and > anepikrita (unjudged, unfixed, undecidable). Therefore, neither our sense- > perceptions nor our doxai (views, theories, beliefs) tell us the truth or > lie; so we certainly should not rely on them. Rather, we should be adoxastoi > (without views), aklineis (uninclined toward this side or that), and > akradantoi (unwavering in our refusal to choose), saying about every single > one that it no more is than it is not or it both is and is not or it neither > is nor is not. According to Christopher I. Beckwith's analysis of the Aristocles Passage, adiaphora (anatta), astathmƒìta (dukkha), and anepikrita (impermanence) are strikingly similar to the Buddhist three marks of existence, indicating that Pyrrho's teaching is based on Buddhism. Beckwith contends that the 18 months Pyrrho spent in India was long enough to learn a foreign language, and that the key innovative tenets of Pyrrho's skepticism were only found in Indian philosophy at the time and not in Greece. === Pyrrhonist influences on NƒÅgƒÅrjuna === Roman trade in the subcontinent according to the Periplus Maris Erythraei 1st century CE Because of the high degree of similarity between Madhyamaka and Pyrrhonism, particularly the surviving works of Sextus Empiricus,Adrian Kuzminski, Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism 2008 Thomas McEvilleyThomas McEvilley, The Shape of Ancient Thought 2002 pp499-505 and Matthew Nealehttps://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:347ed882-f7ac-4098-908f-5bb391462a6c/download_file?file_format=pdf&safe;_filename=THESIS01&type;_of_work=Thesishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMZwyPdY7eg&t;=52s suspect that NƒÅgƒÅrjuna was influenced by Greek Pyrrhonist texts imported into India. According to legend, Nagarjuna said he was influenced by books inaccessible to other people. He was approached by Nagas (semi-divine serpents) in human form. They invited him to their kingdom to see some texts they thought would be of great interest to him. Nagarjuna studied those texts and brought them back to India.Lex Hixon Mother of the Buddhas: Meditations on the Prajnaparamita Sutra 1993 p.xii Matthew Neale illustrated such viewpoint inspired by Joseph G. Walser , \\"NƒÅgƒÅrjuna was a skillful diplomat concealing novel doctrines in acceptably Buddhist discourse... to conceal their doctrines‚Äô derivation from foreign wisdom traditions.\\" ===Greek influence on Indian thought=== During this era trade between India and the Roman Empire flourished and Greek ideas became influential in India. Although there is no direct proof that NƒÅgƒÅrjuna had access to Greek Pyrrhonist texts, there's ample evidence of other Greek texts that were imported into India and that ideas from those texts were incorporated into Indian thought. According to David Pingree, there is substantial similarity between ancient Indian and pre- Ptolomaic Greek astronomy. Pingree believes that these similarities suggest a Greek origin for certain aspects of Indian astronomy. One of the direct proofs for this approach is the fact quoted that many Sanskrit words related to astronomy, astrology, and calendars are either direct phonetical borrowings from the Greek language, or translations, assuming complex ideas, like the names of the days of the week which presuppose a relation between those days, planets (including Sun and Moon) and gods. Hellenistic astronomy profoundly influenced Indian astronomy.Highlights of Astronomy, Volume 11B: As presented at the XXIIIrd General Assembly of the IAU, 1997.

Translation: \\"The influence of Greek astronomy on Indian astronomy may have taken place earlier than thought, as soon as the Hellenistic period, through the agency of the Greek colonies of the Greco-Bactrians and the Indo-Greeks. The Greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets, further influenced the astronomers like Varahamihira and Brahmagupta.D. Pingree: \\"History of Mathematical Astronomy in India\\", Dictionary of Scientific Biography, Vol. 15 (1978), pp. 533‚Äì633 (533, 554f.) Several Greco- Roman astrological treatises are also known to have been exported to India during the first few centuries of our era. The Yavanajataka was a Sanskrit text of the 3rd century CE on Greek horoscopy and mathematical astronomy. Rudradaman's capital at Ujjain \\"became the Greenwich of Indian astronomers and the Arin of the Arabic and Latin astronomical treatises; for it was he and his successors who encouraged the introduction of Greek horoscopy and astronomy into India.\\"Pingree, David \\"Astronomy and Astrology in India and Iran\\" Isis, Vol. 54, No. 2 (Jun. 1963), pp. 229‚Äì246 Later in the 6th century, the Romaka Siddhanta (\\"Doctrine of the Romans\\"), and the Paulisa Siddhanta (\\"Doctrine of Paul\\") were considered as two of the five main astrological treatises, which were compiled by VarƒÅhamihira in his Pa√±ca-siddhƒÅntikƒÅ (\\"Five Treatises\\"), a compendium of Greek, Egyptian, Roman and Indian astronomy. VarƒÅhamihira goes on to state that \\"The Greeks, indeed, are foreigners, but with them this science (astronomy) is in a flourishing state.\\" Another Indian text, the Gargi-Samhita, also similarly compliments the Yavanas (Greeks) noting that the Yavanas though barbarians must be respected as seers for their introduction of astronomy in India. For example, Numerous interactions with the Mauryan Empire, and the later expansion of the Indo-Greeks into India suggest that transmission of Greek astronomical ideas to India occurred during this period. ==Parallels between Pyrrhonism and Buddhism== ===Catu·π£ko·π≠i=== Catu·π£ko·π≠i is a logical argument that is important in the Buddhist logico-epistemological traditions, particularly those of the Madhyamaka school, and in the skeptical Greek philosophy of Pyrrhonism. McEvilley argues for mutual iteration and pervasion between Pyrrhonism and Madhyamika: > An extraordinary similarity, that has long been noticed, between Pyrrhonism > and MƒÅdhyamika is the formula known in connection with Buddhism as the > fourfold negation (catu·π£ko·π≠i) and which in Pyrrhonic form might be called > the fourfold indeterminacy., p.495 In Pyrrhonism the fourfold indeterminacy is used as a maxim for practice. This maxim is also related to the shorter, \\"nothing more\\" (ou mallon) maxim used by Democritus. ===Two truths doctrine=== McEvilley notes a correspondence between the Pyrrhonist and Madhyamaka views about truth: Thus in Pyrrhonism \\"absolute truth\\" corresponds to acatalepsy and \\"conventional truth\\" to phantasiai. ===Causation=== Buddhist philosopher Jan Westerhoff says \\"many of NƒÅgƒÅrjuna‚Äôs arguments concerning causation bear strong similarities to classical sceptical arguments as presented in the third book of Sextus Empiricus‚Äôs Outlines of Pyrrhonism.\\"Jan Westerhoff Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction 2009 p93 ===Dependent origination=== Aulus Gellius described the Pyrrhonist view which corresponds with the Buddhist view of dependent origination as follows: > ...they say that appearances, which they call œÜŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ±œÉŒØŒ±Œπ, are produced from > all objects, not according to the nature of the objects themselves, but > according to the condition of mind or body of those to whom these > appearances come. Therefore they call absolutely all things that affect > men's sense œÑ·Ω∞ œÄœÅœåœÇ œÑŒπ (i.e., \\"things relative to something else.\\") This > expression means that there is nothing at all that is self-dependent or > which has its own power and nature, but that absolutely all things have > \\"reference to something else\\" and seem to be such as their is appearance is > while they are seen, and such as they are formed by our senses, to whom they > come, not by the things themselves, from which they have proceeded.Aulus > Gellius Attic Nights Book XI Chapter 5 Sections 6-7 > https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/11*.html Similarly, the ancient Anonymous Commentary on Plato's Theaetetus says, with a notable parallel with the terms from the Heart Sutra (i.e., \\"in emptiness there is no form, no sensation, no discrimination, no conditioning, and no awareness. There is no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind. There is no form, no sound, no smell, no taste, no texture, no phenomenon. There is no eye-element and so on up to no mind-element and also up to no element of mental awareness.\\"): > The Pyrrhonists say that everything is relative in a different sense, > according to which nothing is in itself, but everything is viewed relative > to other things. Neither colour nor shape nor sound nor taste nor smells nor > textures nor any other object of perception has an intrinsic > character....George Boys-Stones Anonymous Commentary on Plato's Theaetetus > https://www.academia.edu/6394469/Anonymous_commentary_on_Platos_Theaetetus > 2019 p 21 ===Suspension of belief=== Suspension of belief (epoche) is the principle practice of Pyrrhonism. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna describes the corresponding practice in Buddhism as, ‚ÄúWhen one affirms being, there is a seizing of awful and vicious beliefs, which arise from desire and hatred, and from that contentions arise,‚Äù,NƒÅgƒÅrjuna Yukti·π£a·π£·π≠ikƒÅand 46 ‚ÄúBy taking any standpoint whatsoever, one is attacked by the writhing snakes of the afflictions. But those whose mind has no standpoint are not caught.‚ÄùNƒÅgƒÅrjuna Yukti·π£a·π£·π≠ikƒÅand 51 ===Arguments against personhood=== Sextus Empiricus argued that \\"person\\" could not be precisely defined. He debunks various definitions of ‚Äúhuman‚Äù given by philosophical schools, by showing that they are speculative and disagree with each other, that they identify properties (many not even definitive anyway) rather than the property-holder, and that none of these definitions seem to include every human and exclude every non-human.Against the Logicians I: 263-282; Outlines of Pyrrhonism II: 22-28 This debunking is similar to the Buddhist arguments against the existence of the ‚Äúperson.‚Äù The person is said to lack identifiable entity-hood. A large section of NƒÅgƒÅrjuna's M≈´lamadhyamakakƒÅrikƒÅMMK IX-XII is devoted to demonstrating that the experiencing person cannot be established as existing itself. ===Good and evil do not exist by nature=== Sextus Empiricus argued that by realizing that nothing is by nature more to be striven for than avoided or vice versa, but is instead contingent on occasion and circumstances, that one can live well- spirited and untroubled, not elated (by good things because they are good) and not depressed (by evils because they are evil), and thus accepting occurrences which take place of necessity, be liberated from the distress of beliefs, be they beliefs that something bad is at hand or something good.Against the Ethicsists 118 NƒÅgƒÅrjuna made a nearly identical claim: ‚ÄúBy seeing [their] lack of existence by nature, the thirst for conjoining with the good and the thirst for disjoining from difficulty are destroyed.

It holds the title of largest aquatic insect by wingspan according to the Guinness Book of World Records at 21.6 cm. The title formerly belonged to the Brazilian damselfly Microstigma rotundatum. Acanthacorydalis fruhstorferi was first described by Herman Willem van der Weele in 1907 from a specimen from Than-Moi, Vietnam. It is found throughout Southern China (Fujian, Guangxi, Guangdong, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and Zhejiang) and Northern Vietnam. Liu and associates proposed in 2005 that the species is most closely related to Acanthacorydalis sinesis citing morphological similarities relative to similar Chinese genera of Acanthacorydalis. Specifically the wing and body colouration, yet differed by A.sinesis's lack of sagittal dorsal division. ==Life history== Eggs are deposited between stones near flowing water. Larvae inhabit streams or rivers with low contamination. Larvae are sensitive to pH changes, with instances of A. fruhstorferi populations being reduced due to developments in urbanized locations such as Panzhihua, Sichuan. Typical of other dobsonflies, A. fruhstorferi larvae prey on aquatic insects, juvenile amphibians and small fish. Adults display strong phototaxis and are often seen near waterside lamps. Adult A. fruhstorferi are not predatory, and instead feed on tree sap. A. fruhstorferi individuals display sexual dimorphism. With both body and weapon size being different between sexes. Head size is not different between individuals of differing sexes, and nuptial gifts are smaller relative to other dobsonflies. ==Etymology== The genus name Acanthacorydalis is a combination of the Greek ·ºàŒ∫Œ¨ŒΩŒ∏Œ± (acantha, thorny) with Œ∫ŒøœÅœÖŒ¥Œ±ŒªŒªŒπœÇ (corydalus, pertaining to Œ∫ŒøœÅœÖœÇ, the crest of a helmet). In this specific instance, Œ∫ŒøœÅœÖŒ¥Œ±ŒªŒªŒπœÇ alludes to the genus Corydalus found in North America, for whom it shares the same family with. The specific epithet fruhstorferi pertains to 19th century entomologist Hans Fruhstorfer. == See also == * List of largest insects == References == Category:Corydalidae Category:Insects of China Category:Insects described in 1907 Category:Guinness World Records ","title":"Acanthacorydalis fruhstorferi"},{"id":"63891689","text":"Shah Sirajul Islam Chowdhury is a Bangladesh Awami League politician and the former Member of Parliament of Rajshahi-4. ==Career== Chowdhury was elected to parliament from Rajshahi-4 as a Bangladesh Awami League candidate in 1973. ==References== Category:Awami League politicians Category:Living people Category:1st Jatiya Sangsad members Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Shah Sirajul Islam Chowdhury"},{"id":"63891692","text":"Andrzej Je≈º (born 3 May 1963) is a Polish Roman Catholic bishop, being the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarn√≥w since 2012.

The album included ten tracks, two of which became singles. The first single, \\"Six Weeks Every Summer (Christmas Every Other Year)\\", became a minor hit on the country charts. ==Background and content== Have You Heard...Dottie West was recorded in July 1971 at RCA Studio B, located in Nashville, Tennessee. The sessions were produced by Jerry Bradley. The project was West's fourth with Bradley serving as the producer. The album was a collection of ten tracks. Six of the album's songs were cover versions of hit singles by country and pop artists. Among the record's covers was Don Gibson's \\"Just one Time\\" (which had been recently revitalized by Connie Smith), \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\" by Roger Miller (which had recently been a pop hit for Janis Joplin) and \\"No Love at All\\" by Lynn Anderson.

Hope Valley is a broad montane valley in Alpine County, California, located on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada to the northeast of Carson Pass and south of Lake Tahoe. The valley served as a major thoroughfare for the passage of settlers and emigrants to and from California during the Gold Rush era. Sitting at an elevation of just above and framed by peaks reaching over high, Hope Valley is known for its wide vistas, fly fishing, fall colors, and winter activities. ==Geography== A map of the Carson River basin. Hope Valley is situated along the California portion of its west fork, where the river makes a sharp eastward turn after initially flowing north. Situated on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada mountains, the upper end of the valley begins about northeast of Carson Pass, near the confluence where Red Lake Creek flows into the West Fork of the Carson River. From this point, the valley carries the river north for several miles before making a wide turn to the east. About a mile and a half east of the turn, just before reaching Sorensen's Resort, the wide valley abruptly narrows, and a steep V-shaped canyon carries the river further downstream toward the Nevada deserts. The elevation of the valley floor ranges from at its upper end to at the base of the valley where it narrows into Woodfords Canyon. Ringed by tall mountain peaks on all sides, some of them exceeding in height, the valley boasts over of local vertical relief. The tallest of these peaks are Freel Peak (), Job's Sister (), and Job's Peak (), all three of which are located on the same ridge some distance to the northeast. Six additional named peaks also loom over Hope Valley: Hawkins Peak () and Pickett Peak () to the southeast, in the corner formed by the river's eastward bend; Red Lake Peak () and Stevens Peak () to the southwest, guarding the north side of Carson Pass; and Waterhouse Peak () and Thompson Peak () flanking both sides of Luther Pass to the northwest. Hope Valley is well connected to the California state highway network. California State Route 88 follows the course of the valley from southwest to northeast, extending further westward over Carson Pass and northeastward down Woodfords Canyon toward the Carson Valley. State Route 89 enters the valley through Luther Pass to the north, and intersects SR 88 at Pickett's Junction. Regular snowplow patrols keep both highways open year round, only closing in the event of particularly heavy snowstorms. ==History== Hope Valley was historically inhabited by the Northern Washoe people, whose traditional homeland centered around Lake Tahoe and extended into the mountains to the south and west, and the desert valleys and ranges to the east. Every winter, a group of Northern Washoes would travel through the valley by snowshoe along a trail they called Peweƒáeli Yewe≈°. First they would cross westward to reach the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, where they would harvest salmon from the American River. Then, after smoking the salmon to preserve it for their return journey, they would retrace their steps eastward to bring the salmon to their compatriots overwintering in the desert to the east of Hope Valley. In the summer of 1848, the soldiers of a Mormon Battalion detachment gave the valley its English name. These Mormons were returning to Utah after completing their service in the Mexican-American War. The soldiers were in poor spirits after three of their men had been killed in an incident about a month before at Tragedy Spring, across Carson Pass to the west. When they saw the valley, \\"[their] spirits revived when they arrived in sight of it.\\" Thus they christened the newfound valley \\"Hope Valley\\". Henry W. Bigler, a soldier in the battalion, wrote that they \\"campt [sic] at the head of what we called Hope Valley as we began to have hope.\\" Analogously, in 1855, surveyors christened two similar valleys to the south as \\"Faith Valley\\" and \\"Charity Valley\\", in reference to the three theological virtues of Christianity. During California's Gold Rush era, Hope Valley served as a crucial transportation conduit across the Sierra Nevada. It carried the initial route of the California Trail through the eastern slopes of the Sierras, as well as the initial route of the Pony Express. It was also part of the route used by the famous Snowshoe Thompson. In the early 20th century, a proposal was studied to dam the valley in order to form a reservoir. This proposal, however, was never carried out. ==Conservation== Hope Valley is part of the Carson Ranger District of Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. With the exception of a few scattered inholdings, the entire area of Hope Valley is within this national forest. The valley borders Eldorado National Forest at Carson Pass, and the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit, a special unit of the U.S. Forest Service, at Luther Pass. In 1989, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife designated of valley bottom as Hope Valley Wildlife Area. ==See also== *West Fork Carson River *Eastern Sierra ==References== Category:Sierra Nevada (U.S.) Category:Alpine County, California Category:Landforms of Alpine County, California ","title":"Hope Valley (California)"},{"id":"63891850","text":"The 1970‚Äì71 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers men's basketball team represented Western Kentucky University during the 1970-71 NCAA University Division Basketball season.

It is the oldest surviving Noh- based Kabuki dance drama, which tells the story of a maiden who dances before a bell in the D≈çj≈ç-ji temple and then reveals herself to be a serpent-demon. The work is noted for its sequence of dances during which the performer dances for nearly an hour with nine changes of costume. It may be considered the most important piece in the kabuki dance repertoire, one that the onnagatas are required to learn to show their mastery of classic dances. It is classified as one of the hengemono (Â§âÂåñÁâ©, \\"change pieces\\") that involve quick change of costumes and roles. Geisha and other dancers may also learn to perform parts of the dance as solo buy≈ç dance pieces. ==Origin== The story of Musume Dojoji refers to a tale of a woman who transforms into a serpent-demon and destroys a temple bell Musume Dojoji originates from the Noh play D≈çj≈çji which refers to the tale of a women later named Kiyohime, who transforms into a serpent-demon out of rage due to an unrequited love for a Buddhist priest, and then destroys a temple bell in D≈çj≈ç-ji where he was hidden by the monks of the temple, thereby killing him. The Noh play relates an event some years later when a new bell is being installed. A maiden dances at the dedication ceremony for the new bell, and then reveals herself to be the serpent-demon who had previously destroyed the bell, and leaps into the bell. A Kabuki version of the story may have been performed as early as the 1670s, and it was performed in Edo in 1701. In 1731, a variation of the story was performed as a shosagoto (Kabuki dance drama) at the Nakamura theatre by Segawa Kikunojo I (ÁÄ¨Â∑ùËèä‰πã‰∏û) called Keisei Dojoji (ÂÇæÂüéÈÅìÊàêÂØ∫, A courtesan at D≈çj≈çji) or Muken no Kane Shin-D√¥j√¥ji (ÁÑ°Èñì„ÅÆÈêòÊñ∞ÈÅìÊàêÂØ∫), and this version forms the prototype for later works on the same theme. The version of Keisei Dojoji that survives today (the original is lost) tells of Katsuragi, a shiraby≈çshi (courtesan specializing in song and dance), who visits the temple to pray to the bell in the hope that her prayers will clear away her burden of sin. Nakamura Tomij≈´r≈ç I performing one of the dances found in Musume Dojoji In 1752, a new version of the kabuki dance drama was introduced by Nakamura Tomij≈´r≈ç I (‰∏≠ÊùëÂØåÂçÅÈÉé) in Kyoto in an attempt to outdo the version by Segawa Kikunojo I. He then performed this version at the Nakamura theatre in Edo the following year. This version, commonly referred to as Musume Dojoji and tells the story of a shiraby≈çshi named Hanako, proved to be more popular and has since become the definitive version of the play today. The text of this version was written by Fujimoto Tobun, with music by Kineya Yajir≈ç and Kineya Yasabur≈ç, and choreography by Ichikawa Dangor≈ç. ==Synopsis== The drama begins at the D≈çj≈ç-ji temple where monks are getting ready to consecrate a new bell to replace the old one destroyed by the serpent demon. A shiraby≈çshi named Hanako (ÁôΩÊãçÂ≠êËä±Â≠ê) approaches the gate of the temple and expresses her interest in worshipping before the new bell. The monks initially refuse her, indicating that women are not allowed at the ceremony due to the previous incident of the serpent-demon, but they eventually relent on condition that she performs a sacred dance for them at the ceremony. Hanako first dances solemnly in a formal Noh style, before she performs more lively kabuki dances, changing her costume quickly by employing a quick-change technique called hikinuki (Âºï„ÅçÊäú„Åç, ). She then continues with a number of different dances, and the monks become enchanted by her dancing. Her dancing becomes more agitated, and the monks, alarmed, try but fail to stop her. Eventually she climbs up the bell and reveals herself to be a snake who had previously destroyed the bell, which is where the drama ends. Variations of the story are found in other versions of the play. In one version, the bell lifts to reveal that she has transformed into a serpent or dragon who then becomes exorcised by an oshimodoshi (a repeller of demons) and the monks' prayers. In another, a group of yoten fighters arrange themselves to form the dragon tail at the end. ==Versions== There are many different plays based on the theme of Musume Dojoji. These works are referred to collectively as Dojojimono (Dojoji Temple plays); examples include Ninin Dojoji (‰∫å‰∫∫ÈÅìÊàêÂØ∫) with two dancing maidens, Gonin Dojoji with five maidens, Yakko Dojoji (Â•¥ÈÅìÊàêÂØ∫) with the main role performed by a male tachiyaku, and Meoto Dojoji (Áî∑Â•≥ÈÅìÊàêÂØ∫) with an onnagata and a tachiyaku performing. There is even a Christian version Kirishitan Dojoji where the action takes place in a church. In addition to the Noh original and the various kabuki dance dramas, other versions also exist in bunraku theatre. Characters from other traditions and milieu such as Benkei, the monk Mongaku, and the Soga brothers may also be added to the play. ==Refereances== ==External links== * Produced by Koga Production.

A monumental design composed of white disks of varying sizes are connected on different branches and levels to reflect a snow flurry in Calder's distinct Modernist style. The 1950 mobile was famously owned by the Noyes family before its 2012 sale fetched over $10 million and made it the most expensive hanging mobile ever sold. This mobile is owned privately, while the 1955 R√°faga de nieve mobile is a permanent fixture at the Central University of Venezuela, and the others are displayed in museums. ==Design== A snow flurry The design, called a \\"cascade of white discs\\", is based on snowfall that artist Alexander Calder experienced from his home in Roxbury, Connecticut. It also bears similarities to Calder's 1946 Blizzard (Roxbury Flurry), which is considered a sister work. Another similar Calder mobile is the 1961 Nineteen White Discs. A New Statesman review says that the title Snow Flurry makes sense, but that on first sight it \\"looked ... like a great cabbage white, complete with proboscis, tendrils, aerials and those paned butterfly wings in every unadorned wire\\". The Modernist design comprises \\"a series of different sized, circular white discs delicately hanging from twig like wire branches, casting shadows ... and slowly turning\\". The mobiles are all \\"practically the same\\", using white painted sheet metal and dark metal wire. The sizes of the circular discs get smaller the further from the apex they are; the mobile is structured in a pyramid formation. As a whole, it can rotate a full 360 degrees, but the various branches are restricted as to how far they can turn independently. Described as \\"evocative\\" in a HuffPost review, the mobile is intended to move when breezes take it so \\"the flurries float like light snowflakes\\"; the movement and the shadows produced by the mobile add to the visual appeal. Talking about one of the Snow Flurry mobiles at the Beyeler Foundation in 2012, Calder's son said: ==Artworks== ===Snow Flurry, I=== CGI animation of the MoMA Snow Flurry Year: 1948 Snow Flurry, I measures 238.7 cm √ó 208.8 cm and was gifted to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) by Calder in 1966. It was displayed at the Tate Modern in 2015, where curator Ann Coxon said that, based on the sculpture, \\"a sense of the natural world has also been important: [they were] looking at opening up some of the windows, getting a sense of the outside coming in\\". As of 2020, it is not displayed. ===Snow Flurry II=== Year: 1948 The second of the 1948 collection is owned by the Museu de Arte Contempor√¢nea da Universidade de S√£o Paulo. It measures 185.4 cm √ó 205.7 cm. ===Snow Flurry III=== Year: 1948 Snow Flurry III measures 134.6 cm √ó 228.6 cm and is owned by the Portland Museum of Art, given as an anonymous gift, where it is on the first floor of the Payson building. It was displayed on loan at the National Gallery of Victoria in 2019. At the Portland museum, it is said to be \\"one of the most beloved sculptures\\". ===Snow Flurry=== Year: 1950 Measuring 152.4 cm √ó 213.4 cm, this piece is the best known variation. The 1950 sculpture was owned by Eliot Noyes, a close friend of Calder's, and then his family until 2012, when it was sold at Christie's; the saleroom created a catalog for Noyes' Calder pieces that capitalized on the connection to the owner as well as the artist. It achieved US$10,386,500, a record price for a Calder work and the most expensive hanging mobile ever sold at the time. Its original estimate was US$3.5‚Äì4.5 million. The new owner is also based in the United States. ===Snow Flurries=== Year: 1951 The Snow Flurries mobile is 243.8 cm √ó 243.8 cm and is owned by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. In a review while on display at the Orange County Museum of Art, its \\"pure visual impact\\" was said to be \\"quite arresting\\". It has also been shown at the Nasher Museum of Art, where it took ten workers to hang it. ===R√°faga de nieve=== The R√°faga de nieve overhangs a balcony in the Central University of Venezuela's Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism. Two other Calder sculptures are on the balcony. Year: 1955 The version at the Central University of Venezuela, titled in Spanish, is 320 cm √ó 250 cm. The Venezuelan architect and designer Carlos Ra√∫l Villanueva began designing the University City of Caracas campus in the 1940s, beginning construction in the 1950s in a time of prevailing Modernism in Latin America. Villanueva hired many artists from around the world to contribute works to the campus, including Calder, who contributed four pieces; R√°faga de nieve, a monumental acoustic sculpture called the Floating Clouds, and two stabiles. The mobile was first restored in 1983, and restored again in 2013; its location allows strong air currents to damage it over time while also making it difficult to clean. Restoration involved consultation with the Calder Foundation, and each piece was documented and labeled before it was dismantled and removed. A geometric analysis of the mobile suggested that in some formations it shows Fibonacci patterns in its layout. ===Snow Flurry, May 14=== Year: 1959 This mobile is 243.84 cm √ó 426.72 cm, and is owned and displayed in the Denver Art Museum, having been purchased for US$500,000 in 1997. It was loaned to a display at Denver Botanic Gardens in summer 2017. It was first displayed at the Tate Gallery London in 1962, specifically lent by Calder. A contemporary review wrote that: \\"After an exhilarating correspondence we are greatly indebted to Mr. Calder for lending one of his finest mobiles called Snow Flurry‚Äîit was in the exhibition‚Äîfor hanging in the vestibule at the Art Gallery. When it eventually has to be taken down and returned to America, a feeling of discontent is bound to descend also, this time on staff and visitors alike.\\" ==Notes== ==References== == External links == * Category:Sculptures by Alexander Calder Category:Kinetic sculptures ","title":"Snow Flurry (design)"},{"id":"63891990","text":"Anwar Zahid (12 June 1938 ‚Äì 31 August 2008) was a politician from Jhenaidah district in Bangladesh, journalist, writer, Member of Parliament for Jhenaidah-2 constituency and Minister of Information, Relief and Labor and Manpower. == Birth and early life == Zahid was born on 12 June 1938 in the village of Narikel Baria in Ghorashal Union of Jhenaidah.

The Colonial government acquired vessels which were staffed by Royal Navy officers but owned by the colonial government. The vessels were under local and not Admiralty control. An armed ship, HMVS Victoria, owned by the Colony of Victoria transported troops to New Zealand for the campaign and took part in bombardments of MƒÅori. The British government was concerned about its colonies developing their own navies, not under the control of the Royal Navy's Admiralty. This led to the British parliament passing the Colonial Naval Defence Act 1865, which allowed the colonial governments to own ships, including for military purposes, but they would have to be under the Royal Navy's command. == Flags == The Blue Ensign. In 1866 the British Admiralty advised colonies that if they possessed vessels governed by the Act, they must fly the Royal Navy Blue Ensign but that they must also include on the flag the seal or badge of the colony. New Zealand did not have a colonial badge, or indeed a coat of arms of its own at this stage, and so in 1867 the letters \\"NZ\\" were simply added to the blue ensign, following a decree by Governor George Grey on 15 January 1867. == See also == * Historical flags of the British Empire and the overseas territories * Blue Ensign == References == === Bibliography === * == External links == * Hansard mention of the Colonial Naval Defence Act 1865, in 1884 Category:1865 in law Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1865 ","title":"Colonial Naval Defence Act 1865"},{"id":"63892177","text":"Peter Marzio was the former director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston for nearly 30 years. He oversaw major changes to the museum and was the author of three books. == Early Life and Career == Peter Cort Marzio was born on May 8, 1943 on Governors Island outside of Manhattan. Marzio came from a working class Italian family. He worked as a gas station attendant as a teenager, and became the first in his family to attend college. Marzio attended Juniata College on an athletic scholarship, and received a Bachelor of Arts in 1965. Marzio went on to earn a doctorate in American history and art history from the University of Chicago in 1969. His dissertation concerned drawing manuals of the nineteenth century in the United States. Before his time at the Museum of Fine Arts, Marzio was an assistant professor at University of Maryland. In his time there he helped historian Daniel J. Boorstin with research for his Pulitzer Prize-winning book The Americans: The Democratic Experience. After this, Marzio served in various roles at the Smithsonian Institution (curator of prints and chairman of cultural history). He was a Woodrow Wilson Senior Fellow in 1973, and became director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 1978. == Museum of Fine Arts, Houston == Marzio became the director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston in 1982. Under his leadership, the museum saw major changes in his 28 years. Marzio made a point of bringing art from different cultures into the museum's collection. He created specific departments for Asian and Latin American art. In 2001, he worked to establish the International Center for the Arts of the Americas. During his tenure the museum's collection increased from 14,000 to 62,000 works of art. Attendance grew from 380,000 to 2.5 million visitors, and the endowment grew from $25 million to a high of $1.2 billion in 2008. This success led to Marzio's becoming one of the highest paid non-profit CEOs‚Äìin 2008, Marzio was the 6th highest paid charity CEO, earning over $1 million in compensation that year. Marzio also oversaw the creation of a sculpture garden designed by Isamu Noguchi in 1986. Additionally, he contributed to the creation of the MFAH's Rienzi, a house museum on a four-and-a-half acre estate dedicated to European art donated by Henry Masterson III. For the Chinese gallery that Marzio created, he commissioned Cai Guo-Qiang to create a large and extravagant piece of art by using gunpowder in a live performance. Before his death, Marzio was planning a third building dedicated to the progression of art across various cultures. Marzio's work was acknowledged by directors across the country. James Cuno, director of the Art Institute of Chicago at the time, said of Marzio, \\"He was such a role model for all of us, a director whose priorities were the collection and the community. He inspired us, challenged us and helped us.\\" == Art author == In addition to his role as a museum director, Marzio wrote three books in his career. The most notable was an examination of the work of Rube Goldberg called The Art of Rube Goldberg which was met with critical acclaim in 1973. Additionally, Marzio wrote two books on lithography‚Äìin 1976, The Art Crusade: An Analysis of American Drawing Manuals, 1820‚Äì1860 and, in 1979, The Democratic Art‚ÄîPictures Pictures for a 19th-Century America: Chromolithography,1840‚Äì1900. == Death and legacy == Marzio died of cancer on December 9, 2010. Marzio left a large legacy on the Houston community. His death was announced and a moment of silence was held during a Monday Night Football game being played by the Houston Texans. In the acknowledgement, the public announcer of the game said Marzio \\"believed that the museum should be a place for all people.\\" Kaywin Feldman, president of the board of trustees of the Association of Art Museum Directors said, upon hearing of Marzio's passing, \\"I think the era of the aloof, supercilious museum director has long passed, and that our jobs are much more about openness and accessibility.\\" Marzio had served as president of the aforementioned association from 1988‚Äì1989. Before his death, he worked to have the annual conference for the American Association of Museums in May, 2011 come to Houston. The conference was held after his death and was dedicated to his memory. == Bibliography == * Rube Goldberg: His Life and Works (Harper & Row, 1973). * The Art Crusade: An Analysis of American Drawing Manuals, 1820‚Äì1860 (Smithsonian Institution Press, 1976). * The Democratic Art‚ÄîPictures Pictures for a 19th-Century America: Chromolithography,1840‚Äì1900 (Amon Carter Museum of Western Art, 1979). == References == Category:Museum directors Category:1943 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Museum of Fine Arts, Houston ","title":"Peter Marzio"},{"id":"63892190","text":"Ornithinimicrobiaceae is a family of bacteria.

It is a monument to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust. Dedicated on October 19, 1947, it is one of the first Holocaust memorials to the Holocaust in the United States. ==History== The idea for a memorial to Six Million Jews of Europe was first proposed by Adolph R. Lerner. A Polish Jewish refugee who was a journalist and publisher. He had fled Vienna when the Nazis took over Austria in 1938, going first to France and then to the United States. During 194 3 and 1944, he worked at the official Polish news agency in New York, editing bulletins that arrived from the Polish underground. Lerner was vice president of the ‚ÄúU.S. national organization of Polish Jews‚Äù. In January 1946 they proposed that an internal flame be established dedicated to the heroes of the Warsaw ghetto and the six million Jews killed by the Nazis to be the ‚ÄúAmerican Memorial to Six Million Jews of Europe‚Äù. Lerner won the support for the idea ‚Äì but not the particular Design ‚Äì from the parks commissioner Robert Moses. On May 2, 1947, Lerner received a letter from Moses stating this site had his approval. On April 27, 1947 \\"Eternal Light Monument in the City of New York in Memory of Six Million Jews of Europe\\" was incorporated by Lerner. On May 20, 1947, the name of the organization was changed to ‚ÄúThe American Memorial to Six Million Jews of Europe, Inc.‚Äù Lerner was re-elected president. Then-Mayor William O'Dwyer the 100th Mayor of New York City, was the Honorary Chairman of the National Committee of Sponsors, and Moses was a member ex- officio. A wealthy acquaintance of Lerner's named Israel Rogosin joined the group, pledged $1000, and promised to get most of the rest of the necessary $6000 from friends. On October 19, 1947, a granite plaque was placed in Riverside Park near 84th street to serve as a cornerstone for the planned monument. The cornerstone was placed by then-Mayor O'Dwyer. A crowd of 15,000 attended, including 100 survivors of the Buchenwald and Dachau concentration camps. The ceremony received extensive coverage in the press‚Äîlocal, national, and international‚Äîand it won the hearty endorsements of Jewish and non-Jewish notables. In 1948 Israel Rogosin was appointed chairman of the $600,000 fundraising campaign of the American Memorial to Six Million Jews of Europe Inc. to build the monument. Over several decades At least six different proposals were developed. Including an eternal flame, an assemblage of heroic figures, a sixty-foot stone pylon topped by a bronze menorah, and eighty-foot tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments. Sculpture proposals for this location were submitted by Jo Davidson in 1948, by Percival Goodman in 1949, in 1951 by Erich Mendelsohn and Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, and in 1964 by Nathan Rapoport, among others, but were all subsequently rejected as too ugly, too depressing or too distracting for drivers on the West Side Highway and none received funding. The effort was abandoned in 1964. A monument measuring 102 by 60 feet (31 by 18 m) with a height of 80 feet (24 m), to be sculpted by Me≈°troviƒá, was approved in 1952 but was never built. The Government of Yugoslavia has offered as a gift the granite needed to build a monument. The sculpture was to be of an eighty-foot pylon of two tablets on which the Ten Commandments would be inscribed, a 100-foot wall of bas-relief depicting humankind‚Äôs struggle to fulfill the Commandments, and a giant carving of Moses. When Mendelsohn died in 1953, the momentum seemed to die with him. Over the years, the plaque itself has become the monument. ==Design== The memorial is a square white granite plaque situated in the center of the 12,000-square- foot landscaped plaza surrounded by a metal fence 14 feet in diameter. It is inscribed with the words: Beneath the plaque are Buried two boxes containing soil from the Theresienstadt Ghetto and Sereƒè concentration camp, two concentration camps in Czechoslovakia. Also buried is a scroll describing the defense of the Warsaw Ghetto, written in Hebrew by the Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem Rabbi Isaac Herzog, and translated into English by Rabbi David de Sola Pool. It reads: In 2001, the plaza was restored and improved through a partnership between the Riverside Park Conservancy and the City of New York, part of a requirements contract funded by Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Major support was provided by the Deedy and David Goldstick Foundation, and from the International Masonry Institute of the Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen. Architect Gail E. Wittwer-Laird designed the restoration. It is now called the Warsaw Ghetto Memorial Plaza. The wall surrounding the plaza was restored, new benches and lighting were installed. Bluestone and granite sets form the surface, with bluestone curbing outlining expanded gardens. The plaza was rededicated on October 19, 2001. ==Annual ceremony== Every year April 19, on the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising a ceremony is held in Riverside Park at the plaza honoring the victims of the uprising. ==Caretaker== Since 1991 David T. Goldstick a former real estate attorney and Upper West Side resident, began caring for the neglected planting in the area, restoring and beautifying the gardens surrounding the memorial. He also designed and planted the perimeter gardens. David was as attorney an advocate for tenants‚Äô rights and civil liberties, and as a young man traveled to Mississippi in 1963 to try civil rights cases during the voter registration drive. After retirement, he started volunteering as a gardener for the Park and has done so ever since. On June 5, 2018, at the spring benefit for the Riverside Park Conservancy, Goldstick was honored with the ‚ÄúRobert M. Morgenthau Citizenship Award‚Äù for his work at the memorial. The Robert M. Morgenthau Citizenship Award was created by the Riverside Park Conservancy In 2016. It is granted each year to an honoree chosen for their service to the Park and the community. ==References== Category:The Holocaust and the United States Category:Holocaust commemoration Category:Holocaust memorials Category:Monuments and memorials in New York City Category:Museums and exhibits about antisemitism Category:Riverside Park (Manhattan) Category:Upper West Side Category:World War II memorials in the United States ","title":"American Memorial to Six Million Jews of Europe"},{"id":"63892299","text":"Ante Hrkaƒá (born 11 March 1992) is a Bosnian professional footballer who plays as a defender for Serie C club Novara. ==Club career== On 18 August 2020, he signed a 2-year contract with Italian club Novara. ==Honours== ≈†iroki Brijeg *Bosnian Cup runner-up: 2018‚Äì19 ==References== ==External links== *Ante Hrkaƒá at Sofascore Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:People from ≈†iroki Brijeg Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina footballers Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Austria Category:Expatriate footballers in Croatia Category:Expatriate footballers in Albania Category:Expatriate footballers in Saudi Arabia Category:Expatriate footballers in Italy Category:Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina players Category:First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina players Category:Croatian Second Football League players Category:Albanian Superliga players Category:Serie C players Category:NK GO≈†K Gabela players Category:NK Vitez players Category:HNK Segesta players Category:NK Lokomotiva players Category:NK Luƒçko players Category:NK ƒåelik Zenica players Category:KF Teuta Durr√´s players Category:NK ≈†iroki Brijeg players Category:Novara Calcio players Category:Association football defenders ","title":"Ante Hrkaƒá"},{"id":"63892329","text":"Fine Wine is a studio album by American country singer-songwriter Bill Anderson.

Fine Wine was Anderson's 36th studio album as a recording artist and his first major-label release since the 1980s. The project consisted of 11 tracks that received mixed reception from music journalists and writers. ==Background and content== In 1998, Anderson was signed to Warner Bros. Records as part of a veterans artists project. Other performers were also signed to the roster in hopes of restarting their music careers. This included performers Ronnie Milsap, Connie Smith and Don Williams. \\"I definitely thing there's a segment of the country music audience that's not being sung too. Hopefully this will help fill a little bit of that void,\\" Anderson commented in 1998. The major-label project was recorded at Sound Emporium, a studio located in Nashville, Tennessee. The project was produced by country artist Steve Wariner, along with his wife, Caryn Wariner. Anderson was inspired to work with Wariner based on his reworking of Anderson's \\"The Tip of My Fingers\\". \\"...it was a wake-up call,\\" he recalled in 1998. Fine Wine consisted of 11 tracks, all of which were composed (or co- composed) by Anderson himself. The project included a re-recording of Anderson's hit \\"The Tip of My Fingers\\". Instead of being a solo cut, the song featured vocals from the other country artists who had hit versions of the song themselves. The artists included on the track were Eddy Arnold, Roy Clark, Jean Shepard and Wariner. Other tracks range from ballads to novelty numbers. One novelty tune included was the track \\"My Van\\", which was written with Gary Nicholson and Steve Wariner. ==Release and reception== Fine Wine was released on August 25, 1998 via Warner Bros. Records. It was Anderson's 36th studio album released in his recording career. It was originally offered as both a compact disc and an audio cassette. Upon its release, the project did not make any appearances on the Billboard album surveys, including the Top Country Albums chart. The album received mixed reception following its release in 1998. In their review, Allmusic only gave the album a rating of 2.5 out of 5 possible stars. Meanwhile, Deborah Evans Price of Billboard positively reviewed the album. In her review, Price compared Anderson's career and album in comparison to the album's title: \\"Fine Wine\\". John Weisberger of Country Standard Time also gave the album a positive reception. He called the collection a set of \\"vintage Anderson creations\\", highlighting several of the album's tracks for its wide array of musical styles. Weisberger also was pleased to Anderson recording new music again. \\"It's a rare song that can chart in three different decades, but that's the kind of writer ‚Äì and singer ‚Äì Anderson is. It's good to have him back in the studio again,\\" he said. ==Track listings== ===CD and digital versions=== ==Personnel== All credits are adapted from Allmusic and the liner notes of Fine Wine.

The western part of the town was constructed in 1912, about a half-mile from the east part, as a spur for potash mining. Potash had become difficult to acquire during World War I, as its major producer was Germany. The Salt Lake Potash Company was established to combat the shortages and built ponds, canals, a rail spur and processing station in West Kosmo. In addition, three bunkhouses, a cookhouse, garage, stock corral, general store, blacksmith and coal house were constructed in the town. A 1925 Utah Gazetteer noted the town had a population of 200 people. All that remain of the town are a few concrete foundations and canals in West Kosmo. Kosmo's post office was operational from 1919 through 1922.

Article 101 (1)(a) of the UNCLOS definition also states that piracy occurs on the high seas. Referring to Article 58(2) of UNCLOS shows that piracy can also occur in the Exclusive Economic Zone.

In the 1961 Santa Maria hijacking of a Portuguese passenger ship, the perpetrators were already on board posing as passengers, so there were not two ships. Their motives were solely political.Shearer, I. (2010), ‚ÄòPiracy‚Äô, Max Planck Encyclopedias of International Law, Oxford Public International Law, Oxford University Press. Although there was extreme violence this did not meet the UNCLOS piracy definition of motivation, or mens rae, for 'private ends.'

Although there was violence on board the ship, because there were not 'two ships' this could not be seen as piracy. After the Achille Lauro hijacking, the International Maritime Organisation developed the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation.Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation, Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf.

In the Greenpeace Arctic Sunrise Ship Case the Arctic Sunrise staged protests in the waters of the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone, centred around the oil platform Prirazlomnoya.

The International Maritime Organisation Djibouti Code of Conduct (DCoC) is a soft law approach, where Arab and African States collaborate in maritime security responses to piracy and armed robbery. The Shared Awareness and Deconfliction Mechanism (SHADE) was set up in 2008 as an informal forum for States and Organisations to collaborate on counter-piracy measures off the Horn of Africa. === Maritime domain awareness === An integrated understanding of threats at sea has been labelled Maritime Domain Awareness.Bueger, C. 2015, From Dusk to Dawn? Maritime Domain Awareness in SouthEast Asia, Contemporary SouthEast Asia, 37(2) pp. 157-182. Coordination between international naval operations, defensive actions of the shipping industry and Agreements such as the CGPCS and the DCoC have contributed to repressing piracy and armed robbery.Menzel, A. 2017, Institutional adoption and maritime crime governance: the Djiboui Code of Conduct, Journal of the Indian Ocean Region, 14(2), pp. 152-169. Three regional agreements to combat piracy are the DCoC, the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combatting Piracy and armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) and The Yaounde Code of Conduct (YCoC). The regional agreements enabled development of best practices to combat piracy and global transfer of expertise. The Jeddah Amendment to the DCoC included other illicit maritime activities and is a possible model for integrated maritime security, beyond its regional scope. === Private Security and Insurance === Private insurance has been seen as a guarantee of certainty and security, but it also has a moral economy of risk.Lobo-Guerrero, L. 2012, Lloyds and the Moral Economy of Insuring Against Piracy, Journal of Cultural Economy, 5(1), pp. 67-83. For Centuries Lloyd's of London has offered marine insurance and underwritten piracy risk. The nature of the peril of piracy requires specialist underwriting to match the level of risk with the premium. With ship ransoms of US$3 million per ship, armed security teams offered to transit with ships in heightened risk areas at a cost of US$60,000 for a team of four.Norris, B. 2010, Buyers and Insurers seek options as piracy risk leaps, Commercial Risk Europe: European Insurance and War Management News, 22 August, From 2005 Piracy has been managed by the marine war branch of Lloyd's, the Joint War Committee (JWC). Lloyd's insurance of piracy is a governance mechanism. == Law of Kidnap and Ransom == The 1979 Hostage Taking Convention is an international treaty against the taking of hostages.Roach, J.A. 2010, Global Convention on Piracy, Ship-Jacking, Hostage-Taking and Maritime Terrorism, US Department of State CIL Workshop on Maritime Crimes, Session 3, 17 Jan 2011. Retrieved 5 May 2020. The 1998 SUA Convention and 2005 Protocol similarly address acts of terrorism. The offence of hostage taking is the seizure and detention and threat to kill, injure and detain a hostage. Under the 1988 SUA Convention it is an offence to seize control of a ship by force and act with violence against a person on the ship. These three Conventions apply to Piracy off Somalia, as there is intention to hold the crew hostage for ransom and to seize a ship violently. State Parties must take offenders into custody for trial or extradition, but this is only allowed in the territorial sea. Pirates seized in the territorial sea of Somalia can be delivered to Kenya for trial and prosecution under the transfer rules of the SUA Convention. Any persons assisting or accomplance to an offence, under the SUA Convention, of seizing a ship can be prosecuted. The UNCLOS definition of Piracy, in Article 101 (b) and (c) indicates that conspiracy to, or aiding and abetting piracy could be prosecuted. There are very few legal cases which apply prosecution on the grounds of aiding piracy. If all States in a region ratified (signed) the Hostage and SUA treaties, and implemented them in national law, the international community could combat piracy and armed robbery at sea. == See also == *Anti-piracy measures in Somalia == References == Category:International criminal law Category:Piracy law ","title":"International piracy law"},{"id":"63892571","text":"The Re≈üadiye Mar≈üƒ± () is an imperial anthem of the Ottoman Empire from 1909 to 1918.

While not a franchise, over the years, different trios of women have brought The Beatgirls' trademark humor, glamor, and musical talent to life around the world as well as across New Zealand, developing a degree of acceptance and cultural status across New Zealand's various social groups akin to that of the Topp Twins. While they are often referred to as The Beat Girls, even on their own official website, they most consistently bill themselves as The Beatgirls, including on their Facebook page. == Cultural significance == Corporate-sponsored shows for employees are the main breadwinner for the group in New Zealand, but they're also popular draw cards for national events such as the Golden Shears. They appear at public and private venues, from local pubs, community centers, charity events, and retirement homes, to urban theaters and festivals. They have performed at Wellington's Circa Theatre since their inception, including, for example, the entire month of October in 2010. As Andrea Sanders, the group's co-founder, says, \\"We go from highbrow corporate dos to someone‚Äôs wedding in a small marquee; from the Martinborough Wine and Food Festival with a crowd of 10,000 people to the EketƒÅhuna firemen‚Äôs ball, where everyone was dancing in their socks.‚Äù They are also familiar to New Zealand television audiences through their appearances on shows such as Good Morning and Dancing with the Stars. They have been profiled, interviewed, and featured on numerous other series about contemporary arts in New Zealand, e.g., Dream Jobs (2000), Wanda's Way (TVNZ, 2003), Big Night In (2003), Sunday (TVNZ, 2005), and Radio New Zealand Concert Programme's Upbeat (2017). They were also part of a live broadcast of an international comedy festival, The TV2 International LAUGH! Festival in 2002. The Beatgirls have toured internationally around Europe, Asia, and the United States, as well as many of the Pacific islands. They have represented New Zealand overseas at major international events, including parties sponsored by Sports Illustrated at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics in Australia and Greece, a fact that led Grant Buist's popular Wellington-based cartoon strip, Jitterati, to express relief, contrasting their public persona with that of a contemporary New Zealand artwork sent abroad to a prestigious international arts event. After one of their performances in Greece Katie Couric booked them for an appearance on The Today Show. The Beatgirls are based in Wellington, where the local newspaper has called them \\"as Wellington as the bucket fountain.\\" In 2006 the Beatgirls were in competition with Weta Workshop for various regional and national awards (Richard Taylor won). Sanders, acting the part of a fantasy character named Diello in Peter Jackson's Heavenly Creatures (1994), got to play a love scene with Kate Winslet; in later years Jackson has hired the Beatgirls to entertain at parties. == Style == Like the Topp Twins, the Beatgirls appeal to audiences because of their \\"energy, timing, humour and crowd interaction.\\" They peg their selection of music to their audience's age, choosing music from the latter's teenage years. They appeal to audience nostalgia, but with enough edge that they have sometimes been called a \\"parody trio,\\" although Sanders objects to that characterization: \\"We don't take the mickey out of the songs - it's just we don't take ourselves too seriously.\\" While The Beatgirls began with music from the post-WWII era, when they expanded to '40s music, particularly from the Andrews Sisters, they became a hit at Anzac ceremonies and retirement homes; at the latter they have often performed for free. The Beatgirls \\"are unashamedly 'entertainers.'\\" Sanders sees this as an advantage financially in the New Zealand entertainment world, but she also rejects the suggestions that they are less successful artists than \\"original\\" artists and that their success rests on their sex appeal; the costumes they wear, be they miniskirts or tight pants, reflect the costumes of performers whose work they perform. == Origins and personnel == The group's origins lie in the personal relationship between Andrea Sanders and Billy Watkins, who were born near Wellington in Plimmerton and PaekƒÅkƒÅriki respectively. After performing as a dancer and then a singer in Autralia, Sanders returned to Wellington and joined Watkins' band called Billy and the Blue Flames, which played music in the style of Cab Calloway. In 1994 they set up a band called the Lounge Lizards to play bossa nova but soon found their way to the more lucrative Beatgirls format. Sanders is the group's owner, manager, choreographer, and one of the group's lead singers; Watkins also plays multiple roles, from body guard, business manager, and occasional guitarist, to sound and light technician. Group members have included Carolyn McLaughlin (also known as Carolyn Lambourn), Bea Lee-Smith, Erika Takacs, Emily Mowbray, Kali Chote (also known as Kali Kopae), and Nahrelle Ahrens. McLaughlin is an award- winning sound-effects technician working in both film and television. Ahrens also works in film and theatre, and as a voice-over artist. While working in Sydney for an extended period of time at the turn of this century, Sanders and Watkins established a \\"second-tier BeatGirls trio\\" based there but managed by Sanders and Watkins from New Zealand once they returned. Sanders \\"trained in Russian classical ballet\\" before studying contemporary dance with Deirdre Tarrant; her first professional employment as a dancer was with Michael Parmenter. She is also a marriage celebrant, which adds to the sort of gigs the Beatgirls can promote themselves for. == External links == * Category:New Zealand music Category:New Zealand comedy musical groups Category:New Zealand women comedians Category:Cover bands Category:1990s in New Zealand music Category:Musical groups established in 1996 ","title":"The Beatgirls"},{"id":"63892740","text":"The Xiali N5 is a subcompact sedan produced by the Chinese automotive manufacturer FAW Group under the Xiali brand. == Overview == The N5 ranks in the class of supermini and closes the gap between the Xiali N3 and the Xiali Vela.

She is an M. Phil student of Jamia Millia Islamia and media coordinator of the Jamia Coordination Committee. Zargar was in custody from 10 April until 24 June 2020, accused of being part of a conspiracy to cause riots and of making an inflammatory speech on 23 February 2020. Delhi Police said that Zargar was involved in a \\"sinister design\\" with the \\"objective of uprooting a democratically elected government.\\" The Delhi High Court granted Zargar bail at the fourth application on 23 June 2020, and she was released late on 24 June 2020. ==Early life and education== Zargar was born in 1993 in Kishtwar, Jammu and Kashmir. Her father was a government employee. She moved to Delhi in 1998 with her family, when her father was posted in neighbouring Faridabad, part of National Capital Region (NCR). When she was five, at school in Delhi, she was the only Muslim in her class. According to Zargar in 2018, the attitude that some people had towards her when she was at school in Delhi at the age of five was: \\"You are a terrorist, go back to Pakistan\\". She graduated with a B.A. from Jesus and Mary College, Delhi University, she did an M.A. in sociology at Jamia Millia Islamia (New Delhi), and in 2019 started an M.Phil in sociology with special focus on urban studies at Jamia Millia Islamia. As of 2020, her father is retired, and her mother a home-maker. She has a sister Sameeya. == Political activism == Zargar is a member of the media wing of the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC). According to Delhi Police, she was one of the founders of the JCC, and \\"was the admin of JCC's WhatsApp group\\". In 2020, she joined anti-CAA protests in Delhi. On 10 February 2020 she fainted when she was \\"caught in a scuffle between the police and students\\" and was taken to hospital. === Arrest and bail hearings === She was initially arrested at her residence by Delhi Police on 10 April 2020, with police claiming she was among those who organised an anti-CAA protest and road blockade under the Jaffrabad metro station in Delhi on 22‚Äì23 February. On 11 April she was brought before the Metropolitan Magistrate and remanded in police custody for two days. On 13 April she was granted bail, but immediately rearrested by the police on another charge. Additional charges were brought against her on 20 or 21 April. Delhi police have said that the violence was a pre-meditated conspiracy and all arrests have been made based on scientific and forensic evidence. Zargar is also charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Since 15 April 2020, she has been held in Tihar Jail. This is an overcrowded prison, and to protect her and her unborn baby from COVID-19, she was held in solitary confinement for almost two weeks. Officials of Tihar jail said that she was kept isolated in a single cell, and denied that that constituted solitary confinement because she had been allowed to talk to her family on the telephone at least once. According to a report of The Hindu, \\"A high-powered committee headed by a Delhi High Court judge directed DG (Prisons) to ensure that adequate medical assistance is provided to Zargar\\". The report also states that she was arrested in connection with North East Delhi riots. On 18 April 2020, Zargar's lawyers applied for bail, but this was rejected by the court on 21 April. They made another bail application on 2 May, but withdrew it in court. On 26 May 2020, a Delhi court remanded Zargar in custody until 25 June. On 30 May 2020, Zargar's lawyers again applied for bail, and this was rejected on 4 June by Delhi's Patiala House Court. According to the prosecution, Zargar made an inflammatory speech on 23 February 2020 at Chand Bagh (part of Delhi). Judge Dharmendra Rana said, \\"The acts and inflammatory speeches of the co-conspirators are admissible under Section 10 of the Indian Evidence even against the applicant/accused.\\" According to Zargar's lawyers (Ritesh Dhar Dubey and Trideep Pais), though Zargar had briefly visited Chand Bagh on 23 February before the violence started, Zargar delivered her speech that day in Khureji (another part of Delhi). They denied that the speech was inflammatory or provocative. The judge referred to eyewitness statements and a record of a WhatsApp chat, and said \\"there is prima facie evidence to show that there was a conspiracy to at least block the roads (chakka jam).\\" \\"Noted constitutional scholars, including Gautam Bhatia, have critiqued the reasoning in that order [of 4 June 2020] for Ms. Zargar‚Äôs continued detention.\\" In June 2020, a preliminary report by the American Bar Association said that \\"International law, including treaties to which India is a state party, only permit pre-trial detention under narrow circumstances, which do not appear to have been met in Zargar's case.\\" The report also said that \\"In addition to her legal issues, Zargar has also been the victim of a slanderous online campaign, including falsified and explicit images of her being shared online and through WhatsApp messenger\\". \\"Many student groups across Delhi have held protests seeking Zargar‚Äôs release\\", saying that the police had launched \\"a witch hunt against student activists\\". On 17 June 2020, Zargar applied to the Delhi High Court, challenging the 4 June order and seeking bail. The application was heard on 18 June 2020 by Justice Rajiv Shakdher, who issued a notice to the police asking them to file a status report on the bail plea. At the hearing on 22 June, the police status report said that Zargar was one of the \\"main conspirators and the instigator\\" of riots in northeast Delhi, and was involved in a \\"web of actions animated by unlawful object of creating terror and disaffection\\". The police said that Zargar's \\"protestations of innocence are phony; her actions are neither licit nor legitimate and she is clearly culpable of criminal wrongs of grave magnitude deserving no indulgence from the court\\". Part of Zargar's grounds for seeking bail was her pregnancy. However, Indian law makes no distinction on grounds of pregnancy. Delhi Police told the high court on 22 June 2020, that many people in prison in Delhi are pregnant, and that 39 births have taken place inside prison in Delhi during the last ten years. According to the police status report, in prison Zargar had her own separate cell, a good diet, and medical attention. \\"In fact, more care and caution are being practised in jail so far as social distancing norms are concerned that would be available to her outside the jail premises\\". On 23 June 2020, Delhi High Court granted bail for Safoora Zargar. The court told her not to get involved in any activity which may hamper the investigation, and not to leave Delhi without permission. \\"She has been asked to pay a personal bond of 10,000 rupees ($132; ¬£106) before her release.\\" This was the fourth bail application, which ended after a three days hearing. Tushar Mehta (the Solicitor General of India), represented the police at the hearings on 22 and 23 June. On 22 June, the police opposed bail, but then Mehta asked for the hearing to be adjourned until 23 June to enable him to receive further instructions. On 23 June Mehta told the court that the police agreed to Zargar's bail on humanitarian grounds. Zargar was released from Tihar Jail late on 24 June 2020. After her release, Zargar told a journalist from PTI, \\"I am grateful to the almighty and all those who have spoken out for me within India and outside and deeply grateful to the Delhi High Court for this order of release\\". She also said: \\"I am immensely grateful to my family for standing by me and for going through this trauma and worry. I need time and space to get my health and life in order and I do not wish to say anything else at this point of time. I am grateful to my lawyer\\". The Deccan Chronicle expressed the opinion that Zargar's release on bail had been a surprise, and noted that Jamia Millia Islamia students Meeran Haider, Shifa-ur-Rehman and Asif Iqbal Tanha, and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Natasha Narwal and former-JNU- student Umar Khalid have not so far been bailed. A special cell of the Delhi Police say that there was a conspiracy to orchestrate riots just before the visit to India of the United States President Donald Trump on 24-25 February 2020. The police have registered a first information report (FIR) to prove the conspiracy. On 17 June 2020, a Delhi court gave the police two months to file the charge sheet. On 13 August 2020, the court gave the police until 17 September to file the charge sheet. Safoora Zargar is one of the ten people named by the police as the main accused in the case. Other people named in the FIR were: (1) Gufisha Fatima, (2) Meeran Haider, (3) Tahir Hussain, (4) Ishrat Jahan, (5) Devangana Kalita, (6) Natasha Narwal, (7) Shafa ur Rehman, (8) Khalid Saifi, and (9) Asif Iqbal Tanha who have been arrested. The FIR also named Umar Khalid. ==Online vilification== After the arrest of Safoora Zargar, several people on social media started sharing unrelated images and screen captures from videos falsely claimed to be Zargar. She was three months pregnant at the time of her arrest. The most viral allegation which targeted her pregnancy alleged that she was pregnant by Hindus at Shaheen Bagh. The people shared a couple sex video claiming that Safoora Zargar was in the video, but the fact checking website Alt News, revealed that all the allegations made were fake and baseless. The video was taken from Pornhub and the woman in the video was PornHub model Selena Banks. Other social media posts targeting Safoora Zargar for her marital status and pregnancy occurred, with large numbers of individuals claiming that she was unmarried and that her pregnancy was discovered when she was lodged in Tihar Jail. The Quint fact checked all the allegations, which were revealed to be fake. It has been suggested that the online campaigns against her were misogyny and Islamophobia. Delhi Police hadn't taken any action against the online vilification campaigns and trolls as of 20th May 2020. ==Personal life== Zargar was interviewed in May 2018. She was described as lacking typical Kashmiri features, or a Kashmiri accent due to being raised mostly in Delhi. She was comfortable speaking Hindi. She said that she usually did not reveal that she was Kashmiri because \\"People tend to judge me or look at me differently the moment I talk about my Kashmiri identity.\\" On 6 October 2018, Safoora Zargar married Saboor Ahmed Sirwal in Kishtwar. It was an arranged marriage. When she was interviewed in May 2018, she said that she planned to get married in September. == Notes == == See also == *The order passed on 4 June 2020 by Judge Dharmendra Rana, denying bail to Safoora Zargar ==References== Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:People from Kishtwar district Category:Activists from Jammu and Kashmir Category:Activists from Delhi Category:University of Delhi alumni ","title":"Safoora Zargar"},{"id":"63892764","text":"Scotchtown is a rural locality and town in the local government area of Circular Head in the North West region of Tasmania.

The ruin is on one of the earliest land grants in the Rockingham area and is one of the oldest structures in the area. It is associated with the Bell family, especially James and Jane Bell, early pioneers in the region. Jane Bell gained public attention in 1840 after the death of her child, conceived after being raped; she was incarcerated for two years on Rottnest Island. In 1876 James Bell was an eyewitness to the Fenian escape from Fremantle Gaol and raised the alarm. The cottage is part of the East Rockingham Heritage Precinct, which also includes other State Register of Heritage Places, such as the Chesterfield Inn, Hymus House and Day Cottage. ==History== Front of the ruined cottage in 2020 The land on which the cottage ruins stand, , was purchased by James Bell (1821‚Äì1911) in 1854 or 1855 from local landholder Henry Mead. Bell was a boat builder and ship's carpenter by profession and had been living in Mandurah, where he had been farming since 1847, with his family prior to the purchase. At the time, Bell's family consisted of his wife Jane Elizabeth Bell (1823‚Äì1909), and their four children, a number that eventually increased to eight. Jane Bell () had come to Western Australia in 1839 through the sponsorship of the Children's Friend Society, and worked as a domestic servant at the magistrate's residence in Toodyay. She was raped by her custodian, and conceived and bore a child who died soon after, its throat having been cut. In 1840 she was charged with murder and concealing a birth, but the jury only found her guilty of the latter. She was sentenced to two years on Rottnest Islandthe first European woman to be incarcerated on the island and released in 1843. Following her release, she worked as a seamstress until marrying James Bell in 1847. The block of land Bell purchased had some trees, with swamp to the rear, and bordered Mead's farm. Bell originally built a hut to the back of the block, planted fruit trees, and grew vegetables. The swampy nature of the ground where the hut stood proved cold and damp in winter and was too small for the extended family of ten living there. Consequently, in the late 1860s, Bell constructed Bell Cottage, with the combined property referred to as Woodbine, as a larger and more suitable building, using local limestone and jarrah in the Victorian Georgian-style. The local limestone used for the cottage was a popular building material in the region at the time and available close by. Following completion of the cottage, Bell also built a stone barn on the property. James Bell rose to prominence after he raised the alarm during the Fenian escape from Fremantle Gaol. He built the first school in the region and the Bell family became prominent in early local commercial enterprises and civil developments. Two of the Bell children, James Junior and Fanny, together with her husband Daniel Hymus, were instrumental in establishing the Rockingham Hotel. Grave of James and Jane Bell at East Rockingham Pioneer Cemetery After the deaths of Jane and James, the property was inherited by their son John Bell. In 1936, John Bell died and Bell Cottage came into the possession of Joseph Stokes, who lived on the adjoining property. Stokes rented the property out, and the state of the cottage began to deteriorate. The development and proposed expansion of the Kwinana industrial area saw the Western Australian State Government purchase land in the area for a proposed future railway marshalling yard and rail line. The construction of the marshalling yard never materialised and the land was sold into private ownership again in 1996. The area was fenced off and the condition of the cottage deteriorated further. Little is known about the history of the cottage after passing out of the hands of the Bell family, but the report compiled for the state heritage listing presumed that it saw limited occupation after that and no significant alterations. Attempts were made in the 1990s to restore the cottage, but these failed. Funds were allocated in 2018 to carry out archaeological digs at the site. ==Heritage listing== The cottage is part of the East Rockingham Heritage Precinct, which also includes other State Register of Heritage Places, such as the Chesterfield Inn, Hymus House, Day Cottage and the Mead Homestead as well as heritage listed places on the municipal inventory like the East Rockingham Cemetery. Bell Cottage was added to the State Register of Heritage Places on 27 September 2002. ==Further reading== * ==References== ==External links== * Thorpe, Thomas and Bell Cottages conservation study (1999) Category:State Register of Heritage Places in the City of Rockingham Category:Ruins in Australia Category:East Rockingham, Western Australia Category:Victorian architecture in Western Australia Category:1868 establishments in Australia Category:Homesteads in Western Australia ","title":"Bell Cottage ruin"},{"id":"63892836","text":"HIC ANNOTANTUR TENENTES TERRAS IN SNOTINGHSCIRE [\\"Here are noted (those) holding lands in Nottinghamshire\\"]: i Rex Willelmus ii Comes Alanus iii Comes Hugo iv Comes Morttoniens v Archieps eboracensis vi Eps lincoliensis vii Eps Baiocensis viii Abbatia de Burgh ix Rogerius de Busli x Wills Peurel xi Walteri de Aincurt xii Goiffridus Alselin xiii Radulf fili Hubet xiv Radulf de Limesi xv Radulf de Burun xvi Rogerius Pictauens xvii Gilleberais de gand xviii Gilleberais tison xix Goiffridus de Wirce xx Ilbertus de laci xxi Berenger de Todern xxii Hugo filius Baldrici xxiii Hugo de Grentemaisnil xxiv Henricus de Fereires xxv Robertus malet xxvi Durandus malet xxvii Osbnus fili Ricarti xxviii Robertus fili Willi xxix Willelm Hostiarius xxx Taini regis Cover of the Winchester Domesday Book of the 12th century The Domesday Book of 1086 AD lists (in the following order) King William the Conqueror's tenants-in-chief in Snotinghscire (Nottinghamshire), following the Norman Conquest of England: * King William (c. 1028 - 1087), the first Norman King of England (after the Battle of Hastings in 1066 AD) and he was Duke of Normandy from 1035. *Count Alan of Brittany (c. 1040 - 1093), Alan Rufus (or Alan the Red) was the second son of Odo, Count of Penthi√®vre.

The group had cultural interests and drew mostly on English dissenters. ==Defining the group== Thomas Stewart Traill, in his memoir of Roscoe, called the circle a \\"small private literary society\\". The issue arises whether this group's interests also involved Roscoe's radical politics. Sutton argues that their interests were also political and medical; that this circle fits into a larger pattern of societies; and that in the Liverpool dissenting and Unitarian context, the Roscoe circle was rooted in the ministry of Henry Winder earlier in the century.Ian Sutton, Unitarians and the Construction of History and Biography, 1740‚Äì1820, The English Historical Review Vol. 125, No. 513 (April 2010), pp. 314‚Äì339, at pp. 314‚Äì315 and note 2. Published by: Oxford University Press There were links to Warrington Academy, through its education of dissenting ministers, and of the Lunar Society of Birmingham to Roscoe through Thomas Bentley. In its early days, the group of younger men around Roscoe opposed the Liverpool corporation. They were associated with the Benn's Garden Chapel congregation, that later migrated to the Renshaw Street Unitarian Chapel. When John Gladstone moved to Liverpool in the 1780s, it was in this congregation that he encountered radicals. As supporters of the French Revolution, the Roscoe circle were dubbed the \\"Liverpool Jacobins\\". They added opposition to war with revolutionary France to their other political touchstones: reform of religious tests, abolition of slavery, free trade and the end of the East India Company monopoly. By the end of 1792, however, social pressure and street violence against reformers had changed the atmosphere greatly: as Roscoe explained in correspondence with the Marquess of Lansdowne, the example of the Priestley Riots of the previous year loomed large, and the local press was now closed to them. The original \\"literary society\\" ceased meeting that year. ==Membership== * Lucy Aikin * Robert Benson, Quaker banker, partner of William Rathbone IV * William Clarke (1754‚Äì1805), banker * James Currie * Ralph Eddowes (1851‚Äì1833), Liverpool Unitarian and emigrant to the USAIan Sutton, Unitarians and the Construction of History and Biography, 1740‚Äì1820, The English Historical Review Vol. 125, No. 513 (April 2010), pp. 314‚Äì339, at p. 315 and note 4.

The objective is to improve the mental well-being of pupils, and it teaches mindfulness, social-emotional learning, critical thinking, problem solving, and relationship building. Its purpose is to build emotional awareness, to support decision making with that emotional awareness, to equip pupils with the necessary skills and environment to become purpose-driven, and explore a nuanced idea of happiness. The introduction of the curriculum into government schools of Delhi has been called a reformative step towards school education in India. The idea for the curriculum was laid out by Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia, who is also the education minister of the state. It was developed with the help of government experts and the State Council of Educational Research and Training. The curriculum is mostly based on the \\"Happiness Triad\\" concept of philosopher Agrahar Nagraj Sarman. Taking inspiration from the curriculum, Indian states Andhra Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and Afghanistan, Nepal, and the United Arab Emirates are preparing to implement similar programs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and a subsequent nationwide lockdown in India, the curriculum is being delivered to pupils and their parents via interactive voice response calls and live YouTube classes. == Background and inception== The idea of introducing a curriculum that addresses challenges of modern society was developed by the Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia in 2017. This curriculum was later named the Happiness Curriculum. A team of 40 professionals includes teachers from Government of Delhi schools, psychologists, education consultants, volunteers and the State Council of Educational Research and Training. This team also included senior officials from the Directorate of Education, Government of Delhi and people from various NGOs. left The curriculum was launched on 2 July 2018. The launch ceremony was attended by the 14th Dalai Lama, and the Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal. School officials and teachers from more than 1,000 public schools across Delhi were present at the launch. == Framework == The curriculum is based on philosophies of thinkers and educationists such as Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore and Jiddu Krishnamurthy. It is primarily based on the concept of the \\"Happiness Triad\\" proposed by philosopher Agrahar Nagraj Sarman, according to which there are three components of happiness ‚Äì momentary happiness, long term happiness and sustainable happiness. It is also based on Nagraj's concept of \\"coexistential thought\\" (), which is about simplicity, generosity, kindness and benevolence in the pursuit of happiness. The curriculum also includes concepts about self and relationships with family, society and nature. The curriculum is laid out according to the guidelines of the National Curriculum Framework 2005. It is a grade-specific curriculum for all pupils from nursery to grade eight in schools run by the Government of Delhi. === Guiding questions === A student defining \\"Happiness\\" during a Happiness Class The curriculum employs techniques such as mindfulness, reflective stories, interactive activities, and expression to equip pupils with the necessary skills and mindsets to answer the following questions: What makes me happy? How can I be an instrument in other people's happiness? Teachers use a manual to help pupils explore these questions, whose aim is to enable them to understand the relationship between their thoughts, emotions and themselves, their families, their environment and the society at large. The learning outcomes of the curriculum are awareness and focus, critical thinking and reflection, social- emotional skills, and a confident and pleasant personality == Syllabus and classroom approach == Framework document of Happiness Curriculum, published by the State Council of Educational Research and Training, Delhi The Government of Delhi has established a committee with 200 mentors to manage the curriculum's classes in its schools. The curriculum for all the grades is activity-based with no formal examination or textual reading material. No grades are given; assessments are predominantly qualitative. The curriculum's modules are progressive: pupils explore themes more in depth as they move to higher grades. There are separate activities, stories, expressions, reflective questions and mindfulness activities for each grade from nursery to eight. Lessons include learning to be aware of one's emotions in nursery and understanding the purpose of one's body and one's self in grade eight. == Impact == right The program is run in over a thousand Government of Delhi schools; according to Sisodia, \\"Mindfulness is practised by all 16 lakh [1.6 million] pupils everyday\\". Many teachers and parents have reported the pupils' interest in academics and their behaviour has improved because of the curriculum. == Reception == The curriculum was praised by several media outlets, including Le Monde, World Economic Forum, and NPR, and was called a reformative step towards school education in India. Happiness classes have been visited by several institutional heads, academicians, officials from education departments of other state governments in India and abroad. Versions of the curriculum have been adopted by Indian states Andhra Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Afghanistan, Nepal, and the United Arab Emirates are also preparing to implement similar programs. At the first anniversary celebration of the curriculum in July 2019, the Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi praised it. During her visit to India, on 25 February 2020, the First Lady of the United States Melania Trump visited a happiness class at a school run by the Government of Delhi. == Response to COVID-19 pandemic == On 5 March 2020, the Government of Delhi issued orders to shut all of its primary schools to tackle the spread of COVID-19. This order was later extended to all educational institutions in the state. On 25 March, the Government of India announced a nationwide lockdown, and with increased stress and anxiety during the lockdown, delivery and execution of the Happiness Curriculum was taken to homes. Each parent received interactive voice response calls to guide them with \\"Happiness\\" activities, stories, and mindfulness practices. == See also == *21st century skills *Outcome-based education *Social emotional development *Student-centred learning ==Citations== ==Bibliography== * * == External links == *Happiness Curriculum blog *Happiness Curriculum Twitter handle *Happiness Curriculum Facebook page Category:Education in Delhi Category:Curricula Category:Happiness ","title":"Happiness Curriculum"},{"id":"63893005","text":"The 1930 Rhode Island gubernatorial election was held on November 4, 1930.

Gebhardt reached Formula 2 in 1982 racing a March 812 BMW but went no further before shifting to sportscar endurance racing.https://www.driverdb.com/drivers/gunther-gebhardt/ ==Sportscars== The team first entered the Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft in 1983 with their own car, Gebhardt JC02 which had a two-litre Toyota engine and raced in the C Junior class with Kennerth Persson. The Gebhardt JC842 and Gebhardt JC843 followed for the 1984 season in the World Sportscar Championship and Interserie races. The JC842 was powered by a two-litre BMW M12 engine, the JC843 the ubiquitous three litre Cosworth DFV engine. Frank Jelinski led the team in competition with a number of other drivers joining him from race to race including G√ºnther Gebhardt. As the year went on the JC842 increasingly becames a women's car with Beate Nodes leading. Jelinski continued to lead the team into 1985 with Jan Thoelke becoming a regular. Two new cars appeared, the Gebhardt GCA which was a Maurer MM83 BMW Formula 2 racing car, modified into a two-litre open cockpit sportscar for Thoelke to race in Interserie Division II. The Gebhardt JC853 followed replacing the JC843 which was sold to British team ADA Engineering. Stanley Dickens drove with Jelinski in the JC853 more regularly in 1986 and the pair moved together to Joest Racing for 1987. In 1987 the Gebhardt JC873 appeared, powered by an Audi two litre turbocharged engine and Walter Lechner became the leading Gebhardt racer. The team stepped away from World Sportscars and concentrated on the Interserie series. Into 1988 and the Audi turbo was abandoned in favour of the proven Cosworth DFL V8 engine. G√ºnther Gebhardt raced more often with Hellmut Mundas leading the team. For 1989 the car was modified into the Gebhardt 88 C2 and was Audi turbo powered again with Mundas racing the car in Interserie races and Rudi Seher racing it in Supercup races. Almo Coppelli and Gianpiero Moretti started racing with the team in 1990, bringing with them the support of Momo. A final car was built, the Gebhardt C901, again with the Audi turbo. The team raced a Porsche 962C at Le Mans that year. Changes to World Sportscar technical regulations in the early 90s, in effect penalising and banning turbocharged engines came into effect. The C901 was rebuilt as the Gebhardt C91 with the 3.5 litre Cosworth DFR V8 engine. The naturally aspirated Sportscar World Championship soon failed as grid numbers fell. The team returned to regular racing in 1999. The C91 was modified again into the Gebhardt G4 with Audi turbo power again but the roof was removed to race in the SR1 class of the Sports Racing World Cup. Frank Jelinski and Stanley Dickens returned to the team for the 1999 campaign. The team folded at the end of the 1999 season. Older cars continued to appear in Interserie as late as 2002. Recently the G4 has been modified back to C91 Cosworth DFR specifications and is seen regularly in historic Group C racing. ==References== ==External links== * World Sports Racing Prototypes - Gebhardt chassis index * Racing Sports Cars - Gebhardt chassis index Category:German auto racing teams Category:24 Hours of Le Mans teams Category:World Sportscar Championship teams Category:German racecar constructors ","title":"Gebhardt Motorsport"},{"id":"63893074","text":"Alexela Concert Hall (, earlier Nokia Concert Hall ()) is a concert hall in Tallinn, Estonia.

His missionary and humanitarian work in China had involved aiding North Korean defectors there, and evidence eventually emerged that the North Korean regime was responsible for his disappearance. In 2015, a U.S. federal court awarded damages to his family after determining that Kim had likely died in a North Korean prison camp after being abducted from China by North Korean operatives who regarded Kim's activities as a threat to the regime. ==Background== Kim was born in South Korea in 1947. He moved to Chicago, Illinois as a young man, becoming a permanent resident of the United States. He served as minister of the Chicago Evangelical Holiness Church. In the 1990s, Kim came to the attention of North Korean authorities by aiding North Korean defectors in China, and by evangelizing to North Korean athletes attending the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia. In late 1999, Kim was in northeastern China, where he had established shelters and a school for orphaned and handicapped refugees. ==Disappearance== On January 16, 2000, Kim was boarding (or, according to some sources, was forced into) a taxi outside a restaurant in Yanji, a Chinese city near the North Korean border, when unknown men jumped in after him and the vehicle sped away. Although Kim's family suspected North Korean involvement in his disappearance, little solid evidence about his fate emerged until 2004, when a North Korean defector to South Korea told authorities he had seen Kim in a cell at the Ministry of State Security office in Hoeryong ‚Äì a North Korean town across the border from Yanji ‚Äì shortly after his abduction. In 2005, a Chinese national of Korean descent confessed in a South Korean court that he had aided North Korean agents to abduct Kim and transport him across the border to North Korea. In January 2005, a number of Illinois lawmakers, including then-senator Barack Obama, jointly signed a letter to North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, describing Kim as a \\"hero\\" and requesting information from North Korea as to his whereabouts. Intelligence reports suggested that Kim had died on an undetermined date in a North Korean prison camp in the outskirts of Pyongyang. ==Lawsuit== In 2009, Kim's son and younger brother, both U.S. citizens, brought a lawsuit against North Korea in a U.S. federal court, seeking damages for Kim's torture and murder. Although the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) usually protects foreign governments from being sued in U.S. courts, an exception exists for countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism, including North Korea. North Korea did not respond to the lawsuit, which was initially dismissed by the court for lack of first-hand evidence that Kim had been tortured and killed by the North Korean regime. However, in December 2014, an appeals court overturned the dismissal, stating that evidence of North Korea's involvement in Kim's abduction, together with testimony from expert witnesses about widespread torture in North Korean prison camps, were sufficient for the family to seek damages. On April 9, 2015, the court handed down a default judgment that Kim had been abducted by North Korean agents, and had likely died in a North Korean prison camp after suffering torture there. His family was awarded damages of $330 million. The Times of Israel reported that \\"North Korea is not expected to pay the damages, but lawyers will seek the confiscation of North Korean assets such as bank accounts and company shares.\\" ==Aftermath== In May 2019, a North Korean cargo ship, Wise Honest, was judicially seized in Indonesia by the U.S. government for allegedly transporting and selling North Korean coal in breach of international sanctions. U.S. federal judges ordered that the vessel be sold to compensate the family of Kim Dong-shik, and also the family of Otto Warmbier, an American tourist who had died in 2017 shortly after being repatriated in a coma to the U.S. from North Korea, where he had spent more than a year in custody on a charge of subversion. In both cases, U.S. federal courts had found North Korea liable for the men's deaths. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1947 births Category:Kidnappings in China Category:Missing people Category:People declared dead in absentia Category:South Korean people murdered abroad Category:American people murdered abroad ","title":"Kim Dong-shik"},{"id":"63893288","text":"Shadow of Darkness (; alternatively Sror Morl Anthakal) is a 1989 Cambodian historical drama film written and directed by Yvon Hem.

The shadow minister for the arts, Mr. Phillip Pendal, deemed the exhibition obscene and an inappropriate use of government funding on a Channel 7 news report on April 1, 1989. The media attention brought hundreds of people to the exhibition and two of Ferrier‚Äôs paintings were bought by the Art Gallery of Western Australia. Ferrier returned to New York and continued the underwear project until she returned to live in Perth again in 1992. Ferrier began developing a figurative expressionist style of painting for several solo exhibitions and received numerous awards and artist residencies. In 2007 Ferrier began an exploration of a multi-disciplinary art practice which was influenced by her work in film and television. She introduced photography, set building and consultation with local Aboriginal Elders in The Quod Project in 2011, exploring her family history at Rottnest Island as a layer that obscured the Aboriginal history as a penal colony. In the follow-on exhibition, Hummaninside in 2013 at the Fremantle Prison gallery Ferrier consulted with local Aboriginal people about their family histories of incarceration and collaborated with photographer James Kerr and Aboriginal film maker Glen Stasiuk in the production of the work. In 2012 Ferrier was awarded The Go-Anywhere Residency through Artsource and travelled extensively in the United States of America in 2013 researching for Talkback, an exhibition that explored race relations and identity through photography and video interviews. This project grew into a collaboration with USA artists Yulissa Morales, Mirla Jackson, US and Australian artist Laura Mitchell and Australian artist Leslie Morgan. Talkback was exhibited in Perth in 2014, Melbourne in 2015, Lynchburg USA in 2015 and in New York USA in 2016. Ferrier moved to live in Melbourne in 2013 and continued her art practice as well as working as a set dresser in the film and television industry. She exhibited regularly in Melbourne and Perth during this time and began writing a feature film script based on her own life. This script is currently in development and has received funding from Screen Australia and Screen West as well as reaching second round, Sundance Film Labs in 2018 and 2019. ==Education== * Western Australian College of Advanced Education * Bachelor of Fine Arts, Western Australian Institute of Technology (now Curtin University), Bentley, Western Australia. ==External links== * Artist's Website (http://www.taniaferrier.com.au/) == References == Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Australian women artists Category:People from Perth, Western Australia Category:20th-century Australian artists Category:20th-century Australian women artists Category:21st-century Australian artists Category:21st-century Australian women artists Category:Curtin University alumni ","title":"Tania Ferrier"},{"id":"63893331","text":"Max Houttuin (born 20 April 1978) is a former professional footballer who played for sc Heerenveen.

However it was not until the season after when he was 22 years old did he get a permanent starting place in the 1985/86 season from trainer Han Berger. Thanks to his good technique, he quickly received the nickname The Wizard of Ter Apel. He made an impression during his first season, but to the surprise of many, Huizingh left for BV Veendam after that season. Berger's successor, Rob Jacobs, did not think Huizingh was good enough. After four years in which the club was relegated twice and promoted once, Huizingh signed for FC Groningen again in 1990. That season, the club, with Hans Westerhof as trainer, finished third in the Eredivisie. After the 1990/91 season, Leo Beenhakker wanted to bring Huizingh to Ajax , but Groningen did not want to let him go. They asked for a high transfer fee and Ajax dropped out of the transfer. In the years that followed Huizingh increasingly suffered from injuries. After the 1998/99 season, Huizingh left Gronigen. He was already 36 years old, but was signed by SC Heerenveen who would go on to be runners up until he league.

The leaves are small, slender (10‚Äì14 x 1‚Äì3mm), and often slightly wider than they are thick (i.e. slightly flattened). Each leaf has a pointed hook at its tip, that curves downwards. Like D. speciosum and D. pulchrum, it has smooth leaf- surfaces. The flowers can be bright yellow, orange, pink or red. D. lavisii can be distinguished by its recurved, hooked (uncinate) leaf-tips. This character, especially prominent in new leaves, and is also seen in D. edwardsiae and D. uniondalense. It can also be distinguished by the rough base of its calyx, with 9 to 13 bladder cells along each ridge. This character is shared with D. boerhavii however.Hartmann, H. & Roux, A.. (2011).

Its distribution range extends from Ashton, Bonnievale and Montagu in the north, southwards as far as Bredasdorp and the northern foothills of the Potberg mountain. Eastwards, it occurs through the Heidelberg and Riversdale regions of the Overberg, as far as Albertinia. Specifically, its distribution range follows the inland transition-zone, between the Renosterveld and Fynbos vegetation types.Distribution map ==Habitat== The habitat preference of D.lavisii is for conglomerates and colluvial terraces, with cobbles of quartzite. Sometimes there are also elements of silcrete, ferricrete or shales (it is frequently found in Shale Renostervelds and Ferricrete Fynbos vegetation types).

She was equipped with a crosshead steam engine with a piston with 22 inch (56 cm) bore and a 60 inch (150 cm) stroke, which was built by Klotz & Kramer of Sandusky, and was connected to the ship's paddle wheels via a wrought iron shaft. Steam for the engine was provided by a single √ó firebox boiler. Lotta Bernard was driven by two paddle wheels with a diameter of and a width of . Her top speed was , which was considered too slow for the type of work she was used for. She was what was called a \\"rabbit\\" type steamer, which meant that all her cabins were located at the stern, and her forward decks were left open. ===Service History=== Lotta Bernard was built for S.W. Dorsey of Sandusky, and was named after his business partner's daughter, and his own son. When she entered service on November 5, 1869, she was chartered by the Northern Transportation Company to carry cordwood from the Portage River and Put-in-Bay to Cleveland, Ohio to be used in ship construction. In 1870 she was sold to Luman H. Tenney of Duluth, Minnesota. Under Tenney's ownership, she was contracted to haul building materials from Bark Bay, Wisconsin to Duluth to be used in the construction of the first grain elevator. In 1871 she was sold to John D. Howard of Superior, Wisconsin, and she was officially registered in Superior. On November 17, 1871 Lotta Bernard was torn from a dock in Grand Marais, Minnesota and was blown ashore, sustaining damage to her hull, rudder, paddlewheels and her boiler. She was eventually refloated and taken to Duluth for repairs. On November 28, 1872 while carrying a cargo of flour, feed and grain, Lotta Bernard broke her rudder chains in a snowstorm and beached near Ontonagon, Michigan. She was released for repairs in April/May 1873. ===Final voyage=== On October 29, 1874 Lotta Bernard left Thunder Bay, Ontario under the command of Captain Michael Norris, with a cargo consisting of a horse 200 sacks of flour and 60 kegs of fish; there were 13 crew members (including Captain Norris) and 2 passengers also on board. As she neared Encampment Island, she began to encounter a storm, and began taking water over the stern. As the huge waves pounded her hull, they began to smash her cabins apart, eventually leaving only the smokestack standing. Captain Norris ordered the pumps started, to try to empty the water flowing into her hull. He also ordered Lotta Bernard bow anchor dropped, in order to swing her into the seas, but she continued to sink. Eventually, the situation got so bad, that Captain Norris ordered the crew to launch the lifeboats. One of the lifeboats which contained eight people was swamped by a wave while it was still next to the ship. Two of the people who were in the lifeboat drowned when it capsized, while the remaining six managed to make it to the other lifeboat. The survivors eventually reached land near Silver Creek, Minnesota, where Captain Norris split the 13 survivors into two groups in order to find shelter. The group of ten found a local Ojibwe camp, where they received shelter, food and got a chance to dry their soaked clothes. Meanwhile, the other group of three found the other lifeboat washed up on the shore. One of the group of three eventually died of exposure. After the storm had, passed the twelve remaining survivors decided to row back to Duluth. They encountered a fishing camp near Two Harbors, Minnesota, where they received food and got a chance to get warm. Afterwards, they rowed the remaining 33 miles back to Duluth. All of them made it unharmed. Although Lotta Bernard was valued at $20,000, she was only insured for $10,000. The schooner Vanguard found Lotta Bernard pilothouse off Outer Island. ==Lotta Bernard wreck== As of 2020 the wreck of Lotta Bernard has not been found. The Great Lakes Shipwreck Preservation Society had plans to try and locate her; they had planned to search for her on June 27-28, and if not found, they planned to search for her on September 12-13. Both of the expeditions have since been cancelled in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. ==References== Category:1869 ships Category:Great Lakes ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1871 Category:Maritime incidents in 1872 Category:Maritime incidents in 1874 Category:Merchant ships of the United States Category:Ships built in the United States Category:Shipwrecks of Lake Superior Category:Steamships of the United States Category:Shipwrecks of the Minnesota coast Category:Missing ships Category:Ships built in Ohio Category:Steam barges ","title":"PS Lotta Bernard"},{"id":"63893531","text":"Apil-kin ( a-pil-gin6), was a ruler of the city of Mari, northern Mesopotamia, after the fall of the Akkadian Empire c. 2126-2091 BCE.

He was contemporary of the Third Dynasty of Ur, and probably their vassal. He was a contemporary of Ur-Nammu. He had a daughter named Taram-Uram, who became the First Queen of king Shulgi of Ur III. In a dedication, she called herself \\"daughter-in-law of Ur-Nammu\\", and \\"daughter of Apil-kin, Lugal (\\"King\\") of Mari\\", suggesting for Apil-kin a position as a supreme ruler, and pointing to a marital alliance between Mari and Ur.

It formed part of the annual Court of Minstrels, a ceremonial legal proceeding for travelling musicians in the nearby counties. The Tutbury bull run is first recorded in 1414 but may be of earlier origin, though a story that it was begun by John of Gaunt to remind his Spanish wife of home is believed false. The bull was provided to the minstrels by Tutbury Priory and, after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, by the Duke of Devonshire. The bull would be chased through the town by the minstrels who could claim it if it was caught. It was afterwards baited to death and served in a feast. The event developed into a competition between Staffordshire and Derbyshire residents who competed to catch the bull within their own counties. After the decline of the Court of Minstrels the bull run developed into a drunken revel. It was abolished in 1778 after a man was killed during a mass brawl. == Origins == An early 19th-century depiction of bull baiting in England The bull run originated as an entertainment during the Court of Minstrels, a 14th-century institution that served to regulate the activities of travelling musicians in counties near Tutbury. It was held annually on 16 August, the day after the feast of the Assumption of Mary, though if this was a Sunday it was postponed by a day. An 1835 magazine article claims that the Tutbury bull run was first mentioned in records of 1414 that state that it was first held in 1377. However, it may even be of pagan origin. One folk legend, which is believed to be false, states that the bull run was started by John of Gaunt, who rebuilt Tutbury Castle in 1374, and wanted to remind his Spanish wife of her homeland where bull running was popular. Bull running was a popular blood sport of the late medieval and early modern period; a bull was made to rampage through a town for entertainment, often chased by the residents. The bull was often killed or maimed in the chase or else subsequently baited to death. The Tutbury Priory played an important role in the bull run; the institution provided the necessary bull, though the obligation to do so does not survive in the historic record; it may be that it was provided in lieu of other obligations to the court. The practice survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries, after which the obligation was transferred to the Duke of Devonshire, who had assumed the priory lands. In lieu of the Assumption feast, a fair was held on 15 August. == Running of the bull == The bull run started at the priory gate, though after the Dissolution a barn belonging to the town bailiff was used (this was sited some from the county boundary with Derbyshire). The Bull's horns were removed, its ears and tail cropped and the skin smeared with soap to make it harder to catch; pepper was also blown into its nostrils to enrage it. The bull was loosed between 4pm and 5pm and the minstrels had until sunset to try to catch him. No man, apart from a minstrel, was permitted to close within of the bull. If caught, and proof given by means of hair cut from the bull, then it was donated to the minstrels otherwise it was returned to the donor. It would then be brought to the town's market cross, baited with dogs and killed. The carcass would often form the centrepiece of a subsequent feast. The minstrels had the right to claim a bounty of 40 pence (3s 4d; ¬£ in modern currency) in lieu of the bull, if desired. In some years the bull had to be caught on the Staffordshire side of the River Dove to be claimed by the minstrels, later it could be claimed within Derbyshire but only by minstrels from that county. The event thereafter developed into a contest between Staffordshire and Derbyshire residents, with fights sometimes breaking out over ownership of the bull. In some years the bull escaped as far as Hoon (near Hilton) or Sudbury (some away). Broken bones were frequent and it was not uncommon for lives to be lost. == Abolition == The Court of Minstrels declined in the 18th-century and the bull run became a more general drunken revel. A man was killed during the 1778 run after a mass brawl broke out between locals and visitors from Burton upon Trent. The vicar of St Mary's Church, Tutbury, Joseph Dixon, drew up a petition to William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire for abolition and, after consultation with the king and government a meeting was called at Ashbourne, Derbyshire. A panel of 15 men from Derbyshire and 15 from Staffordshire agreed with Dixon and the Duke, with the king's approval, directed the abolition of the practice. For some years bull-baiting was carried out in its stead but this too was abolished following the intervention of the local gentry. Bull-baiting continued to be a common and popular entertainment in England and Staffordshire in particular, until its abolition by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835. It was particularly associated with the events of Wakes week in the Midlands and northern England. A more infamous event, the Stamford bull run, continued until 1839 despite being banned by the 1835 act; though the Tutbury run was held to have been more excessive. == References == Category:Bull sports Category:1778 disestablishments in England Category:Annual events in England Category:Defunct sporting events Category:August events Category:Culture in Staffordshire Category:Culture in Derbyshire ","title":"Tutbury bull run"},{"id":"63893553","text":"Maulana Mohammad Mujahid Khan Al Hussaini was a Pakistani Islamic scholar and politician who served as Member of Provincial Assembly of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from 2002 to 2007. ==References== Category:1920 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Pashtun people Category:Darul Uloom Deoband alumni Category:Pakistani Islamic religious leaders Category:Pakistani Sunni Muslims Category:Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam politicians Category:People from Nowshera District Category:Pakistani Sunni Muslim scholars of Islam Category:North-West Frontier Province MPAs 2002‚Äì2007 ","title":"Mohammad Mujahid Khan Al Hussaini"},{"id":"63893575","text":"The following is a list of Lasiocampidae of Nepal.

The film premiered on 1 September 2018 at the Venice Film Festival, and was released on the BFI Player in May 2020. The film is divided into 40 chapters over 14 hours and features the work of 183 directors. In the 1990s, Cousins curated a season of documentary films and realised later he had only included a single film made by a woman. This got him interested in finding and highlighting women filmmakers from around the world and throughout film history, eventually leading to the creation of this documentary. The premise of the film is that it is not about women filmmakers or institutional sexism; rather it is a documentary about film itself, and it explores 40 different aspects of filmmaking, drawing from a wide range of films as examples, all of which are made by women. The academic Laura Mulvey curated the inaugural Women's Film Event at the Edinburgh film festival in 1972, the blurb for their event stated that \\"A festival of men's films would be simply absurd. It's because so few women have been able to make films that this festival exists\\". Mulvey said of Women Make Film that \\"The amazing extent of the work, with over a thousand clips, has the potential to bring women directors out of gender categorisation and into film history as such. But it also offers an unprecedented opportunity to enjoy women's cinematic vision and reflect on the way women have seen and indeed made the world through film ‚Äì a source of wonder and of speculation!\\" The documentary is narrated by Adjoa Andoh, Jane Fonda, Kerry Fox, Thandie Newton, Tilda Swinton, Sharmila Tagore and Debra Winger. The Birds' Eye View charity will host weekly viewing parties and Facebook Live responses and debates on the documentary from women filmmakers for audiences at home during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. ==List of chapters== ===Introductions=== * We Were Young ‚Äì Binka Zhelyazkova * You and Me ‚Äì Larisa Shepitko * On the 12th Day of Christmas ‚Äì Wendy Toye * Brief Encounters ‚Äì Kira Muratova ===Openings=== * The East is Red ‚Äì Wang Ping * First Comes Courage ‚Äì Dorothy Arzner * The Silence of the Palaces ‚Äì Moufida Tlatli * Strange Days ‚Äì Kathryn Bigelow * Harlan County U.S.A. ‚Äì Barbara Kopple * Innocence ‚Äì Lucile Had≈æihaliloviƒá * Things To Come ‚Äì Mia Hansen-L√∏ve * Je Tu Il Elle ‚Äì Chantal Akerman * All for Mary ‚Äì Wendy Toye * Sweetie ‚Äì Jane Campion * Thumbelina ‚Äì Lotte Reiniger * Le Bonheur ‚Äì Agn√®s Varda * The Very Late Afternoon of a Faun ‚Äì Vƒõra Chytilov√° * The Black Dog ‚Äì Alison de Vere * The 3 Rooms of Melancholia ‚Äì Pirjo Honkasalo * The Day I Became a Woman ‚Äì Marziyeh Meshkini * Blackboards ‚Äì Samira Makhmalbaf * Attenberg ‚Äì Athina Rachel Tsangari * Be My Star ‚Äì Valeska Grisebach * The Visitor ‚Äì Lola Randl * A Time to Die ‚Äì Dorota Kƒôdzierzawska * Butter on the Latch ‚Äì Josephine Decker * The Last Stage ‚Äì Wanda Jakubowska * La Cienaga ‚Äì Lucrecia Martel ===Tone=== * Merrily We Go to Hell ‚Äì Dorothy Arzner * Wanda ‚Äì Barbara Loden * Pet Sematary ‚Äì Mary Lambert * Tank Girl ‚Äì Rachel Talalay * On the 12th Day of Christmas ‚Äì Wendy Toye * By the Sea ‚Äì Angelina Jolie * Peel ‚Äì Jane Campion * Beau Travail ‚Äì Claire Denis * Olivia ‚Äì Jacqueline Audry * Maedchen in Uniform ‚Äì Leontine Sagan * Two in One ‚Äì Kira Muratova * American Psycho ‚Äì Mary Harron * A New Leaf ‚Äì Elaine May * Betoniy√∂ ‚Äì Pirjo Honkasalo ===Believability=== * Why is Frau B Happy? ‚Äì Erika Runge * The Hurt Locker ‚Äì Kathryn Bigelow * El Camino ‚Äì Ana Mariscal * Lore ‚Äì Cate Shortland * Which Would You Choose? ‚Äì Dinara Asanova * Meek's Cutoff ‚Äì Kelly Reichardt * Hedi Schneider is Stuck ‚Äì Sonja Heiss * Which Would You Choose? ‚Äì Dinara Asanova * Toni Erdmann ‚Äì Maren Ade * Point Break ‚Äì Kathryn Bigelow * The Blot ‚Äì Lois Weber * Frozen River ‚Äì Courtney Hunt * Selma ‚Äì Ava DuVernay * Not a Pretty Picture ‚Äì Martha Coolidge * The Apple ‚Äì Samira Makhmalbaf ===Introducing a Character=== * The Moon has Risen ‚Äì Kinuyo Tanaka * Germany, Pale Mother ‚Äì Helma Sanders-Brahms * Somewhere ‚Äì Sofia Coppola * Nana ‚Äì Val√©rie Massadian * The Connection ‚Äì Shirley Clarke * The Watermelon Woman ‚Äì Cheryl Dunye * Wayne's World ‚Äì Penelope Spheeris * Fish Tank ‚Äì Andrea Arnold * Girlhood ‚Äì C√©line Sciamma * Toni Erdmann ‚Äì Maren Ade * The Story of the Flaming Years ‚Äì Yuliya Solntseva ===Meet Cute=== * Krane's Confectionery ‚Äì Astrid Henning-Jensen * Brief Encounters ‚Äì Kira Muratova * The Seashell and the Clergyman ‚Äì Germaine Dulac * The Heartbreak Kid ‚Äì Elaine May * Grand Central ‚Äì Rebecca Zlotowski * One.

Its wood is used for construction and fuel, and parts of plant are ascribed medicinal use. ==Etymology== The epithet of the species, ramiflora refers to the ramiflorous inflorescences, deriving from the Latin rami- (pertaining to branches) and -florus (flowered). ==Description== The tree grows up to 10-20 m tall. The trunks dbh is up to 60 cm, it can be buttressed or multistemmed, and has a red blaze (longitudinal cut exposure of bark). Leaves are compound with one, rarely two, pairs of leaflets. New leaves are pink. Lateral veins form loops well inside blade margin. Inflorescence axis is up to 20 mm long, up to 20-flowered, petal are white. Fruit is an asymmetrical, roughly globose nut, roughly 45 √ó 39 √ó 34 mm, rust brown and woody, solitary seed. Flowering while in cultivation has been recorded in August and October, fruiting has been recorded in Queensland in October and in cultivation in May. In Australia, C. ramiflora can be distinguished from other Cynometra species by the glabrous rachis and petiolules of the leaves (though these are minutely hairy or glabrescent on Christmas Island), the globose fruit with a small beak near the apex of the dorsal side, and by the pink new leaves. ==Habitat== Cynometra ramiflora grows on both rocky and sandy seashores, besides tidal rivers, on the landward side of mangrove forests, and in inland forests up to 400 m elevation. It is particularly found in environments that experience flooding or high soil moisture. It is found in primary, secondary and disturbed forests. In the native limestone forest of the island of Saipan (largest of the Northern Mariana Islands), it is co- dominant in the canopy with Pisonia grandis and, along with Guamia mariannae, it is most common in the understorey. At Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, and Christmas Island it grows in mangrove forest and adjacent rainforest, particularly seasonally flooded areas, at elevation from sea level to 20 m. In Cambodia it grows in back-mangrove forests and freshwater flooded forests. ==Distribution== The species is found in New Caledonia, Caroline Islands, Solomon Islands, Guam, Federated States of Micronesia, Northern Mariana Islands, Queensland (Australia), Bismarck Archipelago, New Guinea, Maluku, Palau, Lesser Sunda Islands, East Timor, Sulawesi, Philippines, Borneo, Java, Sumatra, Christmas Island, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Nicobar Islands, Andaman Islands, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka. It has been naturalized in the Society Islands (Tahiti and others) In Queensland, it is known only from the tip of Cape York. In Myanmar it is found in the Tanintharyi and Ayeyarwady Regions and Rakhine State. ==Ecology== In Manusela National Park, Seram, eastern Indonesia, the fruit are eaten by Geoffroyus geoffroyi, the red-cheeked parrot, while the flowers or nectar are fed on by Philemon subcorniculatus, the Seram friarbird. The plant is a food source for the Nolidae moth Carea costiplaga Swinhoe, 1893. ==Conservation status== The tree has been rated as having least concern conservation status by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This is because even though it may be locally impacted by deforestation, it has a large and widespread population with no major threats. The species is assessed as threatened in Singapore. ==Vernacular names== *cynometra, wrinkle pod mangrove (Australia) *kateng, kepel, wunut (Indonesia) *katong, katong laut (laut=\\"ocean\\", Malay) *ch√¢mpr√©:nh (Khmer) *myinga, ye-minga (Myanmar)] ==Uses== Cynometra ramiflora has hard and heavy timber, which is used in small volumes in construction, including for door posts. The wood is also used for tool handles, wood craft and ornamental work. The species is cultivated for ornamental purposes, and the leaves, roots and seeds are harvested for use in traditional medicine. The wood is used for temporary constructions in Cambodia. It makes excellent firewood. In India, in order to treat skin diseases, the leaf is boiled in cow's milk, mixed with honey and then applied externally. Oil from the seed is also used for skin diseases, applied externally, while the root is given as a purgative and cathartic. Amongst the Rejang people of southwestern Sumatera, C. ramiflora is one of the trees that are most frequently regarded as a sialang tree. These are trees, tall and outstanding in the forest, with a nest of the honeybee Apis dorsata. Each sialang tree is held to have a sacred occupant, usually a female deity (though sometimes called Sernad Belelkat) who is the owner of the bees, nest and honey. To gather the wild honey from this tree is regarded as going into the perilous realm of the spirit world, and appropriate precautions need to be taken. ==References== ramiflora Category:Flora of Australia Category:Flora of tropical Asia Category:Flora of the Pacific Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Cynometra ramiflora"},{"id":"63893830","text":"thumb Inspirasia Foundation is a non-profit organisation that funds and support projects in health and education for marginalised communities and persons with disabilities. == Origin == In 2002, The Kuta Terrorist Bomb in Bali Indonesia claimed the life of Annika Linden along with another 202 people.The Annika Linden Foundation was set up in 2003 by her fianc√©e Mark Weingard in her honour.

He took a special interest in studies of diabetes, goitre, and myeloma. Being of Jewish origin, he escaped Nazi persecution and became a citizen of the United States of America in 1940 and served as a professor at Yale University. Magnus-Levy was born in Berlin and went to study medicine at the University of Berlin. Several of his near family died from infectious disease and his mother suffered diabetes and although initially inspired to study history after meeting Theodor Mommsen he went on to study medicine at Berlin, Heidelberg, and Erlangen. He was inspired by the lectures of Franz Hofmeister and Karl Ludwig and after receiving an MD from Heidelberg in 1890 he sought to study physiology. He then studied under Nathan Zuntz in Berlin, studying gas exchange and then energetics under Eugen Baumann in Freiburg. In Berlin he worked with Albert Fr√§nkel and at Frankfurt with Carl von Noorden. He began to take a special interest in obesity, diabetes, and myxedema. He published on the influence of the thyroid on respiration in 1895. He studied diabetic acidosis in Strassburg along with Bernhard Naunyn. He became an instructor (privatdozent) with a thesis on Oxybutyric Acid and its Relation to the Diabetic Coma (1899) and joined the University of Berlin in 1905. He worked as a chief of medical service in Berlin from 1910 to 1922. He published several works while working in Berlin including The Physiology of Metabolism (1908), Chemical Problems of Diabetes (1910), and Acids and Bases in Disease (1930). Being from a Jewish family, he lost his position after the Nazis came to power and in 1940 he moved with his family to the United States of America and he became a professor at Yale University. Here he worked on the use of isotopes for studying human metabolism. In later life, he wrote on the history of medicine in Germany. Among his studies on basal metabolic rate, he found that his own BMR had declined by 10% from the age of 26 to 76. Magnus-Levy died in New York. He had prepared a letter that he wrote to be read at his funeral in which he thanked his family, John Farquhar Fulton, the home that cared for him in old age, the United States of America, the American medical community and all his friends.

It grows on native and introduced trees where it can cause heart rot, and does not seem to be associated with conifers. ==Description== Underside picture of a young Cyclocybe parasitica fruiting bodies cluster with intact velum The cap is centrally attached, buff coloured, and darker at center. Stem is pale with white flesh. Veil is pressing against the gills and turns into a prominent ring often striated with dark brown spore print upon the stem expansion. Spores are cylindrical and thick walled with a prominent germ pore. ==Ecology== The species grows parasitically and saprotrophically in hardwood trees such as Beilschmiedia tawa, Hoheria or Plagianthus but can also be found on Nothofagus, birches or poplars. It is native and probably indigenous to New Zealand. Fruiting bodies usually occur in late summer and autumn, sometimes single but usually in clusters. ==Uses== Tawaka is an edible mushroom with meaty savoury taste. It can be collected in the wild or cultivated on logs that are inoculated 4 to 8 weeks after cutting and defoliating. According to a study from Lincoln University in 1990, tawaka contains approximately 20% protein in dry mass, which is roughly half of what can be found in the common button mushroom, while the essential amino acid composition is similar. On the other hand, available carbohydrate content is almost 3 times higher. Although most commonly known for its culinary value, tawaka was historically used by MƒÅori people as a traditional medicine. ==References== ==External links== * Agrocybe parasitica on the T.E.R.R.A.I.N site Category:Strophariaceae Category:Fungi of Australia Category:Fungi of New Zealand Category:Fungi described in 1982 Category:Edible fungi ","title":"Cyclocybe parasitica"},{"id":"63894065","text":"Henry Patrick Lardner-Burke was a South African flying ace of World War II, credited with 7.5 'kills'.

Sold as a syrup packaged in yellow sachets, it is one of the most popular brands in Indonesia. ==Product== The product contains, as ingredients, ginger, wild mint, fennel, cumin, screw tree, cloves, and honey, with a claimed secret recipe. It is typically sold in sachets, priced at less than $0.25 each in 2014. Generally, it is consumed in Indonesia by people experiencing \\"masuk angin\\" (lit. \\"entry of wind\\") ‚Äì a general description for common ailments resulting in weakened immune systems. Several variants are manufactured, including sugar-free and child-oriented variants, and separate products such as Tolak Angin branded candies and ointment. ==Brand== In Indonesia, Tolak Angin is ubiquitously used and is one of the most popular consumer brands, with the product being sold in millions of small vendors. The product is well-recognized by its yellow sachet packaging, which has been copied by similar products of competitors. The brand's slogan is \\"Orang pintar minum Tolak Angin\\" (\\"Smart people takes Tolak Angin\\"). Outside of Indonesia, Tolak Angin is also sold in, for example, Philippines, Malaysia, Nigeria, Hong Kong, Australia, the Netherlands, and the United States. Exports outside Indonesia comprised around 5 percent of the product's sales in 2014. In 2016, it was reported that the annual production of the product was at 780 million sachets. ==History== The mixture was reportedly first developed by Rahmat Sulistyo in 1930, as a family recipe.

In 2015, Tolak Angin sachets sold in California were given Prop 65 warnings which indicated that they contained lead. The distributor later clarified that the warnings were due to \\"abundance of caution\\".

He was the first naval officer to attain the rank of Rear Admiral in the Philippine Navy. He became overall military commander in Mindanao at the height of the Muslim secessionist movement led by the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in the mid-1970s, during which he promoted a \\"Policy of Attraction\\" which won the respect of many Muslims and led 35,411 rebels to return to the fold of law by late 1978, and over 40,000 rebels by the early 1980s. == Early life and education == Espaldon was the son of Christian Bicolano teachers Cipriano Espaldon and Claudia Mercader. Heeding the call of the government to serve in the remotest places in the Philippines in the early part of the 20th century, his family moved from Sorsogon to Tawi-Tawi where his parents were pioneer educators. His ability to speak Tausug and Sinama, and his understanding of Muslim custom would later prove indispensable during his military and civilian career. He would eventually embrace Islam. He graduated as valedictorian from Bongao Elementary School in Tawi-Tawi in 1938, and with honors from Sulu High School in 1942. After World War II, Espaldon was sent to the Cooks and Bakers School of the Philippine Army at Camp Olivas where he graduated First Honor. On March 23, 1946, as he and his classmates were about to board a Douglas C-47 plane to return to Mindanao after graduation, he received orders that he would be retained as instructor at the school for having topped his class; hence, he remained at Camp Olivas. That day, the plane crashed on Mount Banahaw, killing most of the military passengers on board. At the time, it was the fifth worst aviation accident in Philippine history. After instructing at Camp Olivas, he attended FEATI University as a scholar and pursued a degree in aeronautical engineering. In January 1947, Espaldon was one of 50 Filipino scholars selected by the United States Merchant Marine Academy (Kings Point) among 5,000 examinees to join 150 Americans in the Class of 1950. An honor student and cadet officer, he eventually made history in the Academy as being only the third alumnus inducted into its Hall of Distinguished Graduates in 1995 for being the first Academy graduate to attain the rank of Rear Admiral and for his successful efforts in bringing peace to Southern Philippines. As of 2020, he remains the only non-American inductee. In 1968, he graduated from the Naval Command Course at the US Naval War College. A few years later, he obtained his masters degree in National Security Administration from the National Defense College of the Philippines. == Military career == Espaldon's military career began at the age of 16 when he volunteered in the USAFFE as a member of the Bolo Batallion Unit in 1941 to fight the invading Japanese forces. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, he was a teenage guerrilla leader in Sulu and Tawi-Tawi. After World War II, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Philippine Army. Shortly after graduating from Kings Point in 1950, he was commissioned as an ensign in the Philippine Navy and became commanding officer of RPS Capiz and later RPS Iloilo. A decade later, he was appointed as naval attach√© to Indonesia and Malaysia, and became fluent in Bahasa Indonesia. After returning to the Philippines, he served as Chief of Naval Intelligence in 1966, as Acting Chief of the Intelligence Service of the AFP (ISAFP) in 1969, then as Vice Commander of the Philippine Navy in 1971. In 1972, he would become Deputy Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), only to be deprived of the top post because the Marcos administration reportedly preferred a super-loyalist like General Fabian Ver. Veteran Associated Press correspondent Gil Santos noted that Espaldon was one of the few \\"good guys\\" who wanted to restore professionalism in the military and got sidelined by Marcos and Ver. That same year, the MNLF was founded by Nur Misuari as a splinter group of the Muslim Independence Movement. At its peak in 1974, it was able to field between 50,000 and 60,000 rebels, and as many as 20,000 were reportedly trained in Sabah with financial assistance from Libya. In October 1972, Espaldon was designated as acting military supervisor of the Bureau of Customs due to the extortion syndicate and rampant smuggling that plagued the Bureau. He would later be conferred the Outstanding Achievement Award for the rejuvenation, reorganization and cleansing of the Bureau. In 1973, Espaldon replaced his fellow Kings Point cadet Commodore Gil Fernandez as commanding officer of the AFP Southwest Command (SOWESCOM) reportedly to satisfy the terms of surrender of the MNLF Magic Eight. They had previously sought the relief of Fernandez who allegedly lacked sympathy for the Muslims. This signaled a desire for a changed approach in Mindanao from that of hard-lining Fernandez. In addition to his military duties, he was appointed as the first governor of Tawi-Tawi when it became a province on September 27, 1973, and served until the first provincial elections were held pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 302. (Under the 1973 Constitution, only elective officials were prohibited from holding multiple government offices.) During the first 730 days of Tawi-Tawi as a province, Espaldon and Vice Governor Nur Jaafar spearheaded over 100 civilian infrastructure projects, including the construction of the provincial capitol, provincial hospital, public market, 50 mosques, school houses, radio station, airstrips, piers, houses, bridges, roads and water system. The following year, he was designated as the second military governor of the newly-created province of Basilan, but administered the affairs of government through Colonel Florencio E. Magsino. On December 29, 1973, Espaldon became the first naval officer to be promoted to rear admiral in the Philippine Navy. Later that day, Commodore Hilario Ruiz, then Flag Officer-in-Command of the Philippine Navy, was likewise promoted to rear admiral. On July 7, 1975, the Office of the Regional Commissioner for Region IX was created within the policy of rapprochement, in reversal of the iron-fist approach and Espaldon served as its first and only commissioner until it was abolished and replaced with the Lupong Tagapagpaganap Ng Pook (LTP) in 1979. He was succeeded by Ulbert Ulama \\"Bob\\" Tugung. That same month, he led the signing and implementation of the Philippines-Indonesia Agreements on Border Crossing and Border Patrol which enhanced the maritime security cooperation between the two countries, for which he would later be awarded the Bintang Yudha Dharma Pratama, Indonesia's second highest military order of merit. In 1976, SOWESCOM would become the AFP Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) with Espaldon as its first commander. As overall military commander in Mindanao, he was given full authority to command all forces in the south without the need to seek clearance from service chiefs to deploy troops. The doubling of Espaldon's authority reportedly resulted from the fact that his tactics had reduced the war in the SOWESCOM area, while the achievements of the AFP Central Mindanao Command (CEMCOM) under Gen. Fortunato Abat had been less notable. That same year, he was appointed as member of the Agency for the Development and Welfare of Muslims in the Philippines which was chaired by Ambassador Lininding Pangandaman. Following the execution of the Tripoli Agreement in Libya on December 23, 1976, a ceasefire agreement was signed in Zamboanga City on January 20, 1977 between Espaldon and Dr. Tham Manjoorsa, authorized representative of the MNLF. A subsequent plebiscite led to the creation of two autonomous regions, Regions IX and XII, in Mindanao. By late 1978, Espaldon announced the collapse of the Northern Mindanao Revolutionary Command led by Abul Khayr Alonto and the surrender of 1,215 rebels, bringing the total to 35,411. Throughout his stint as overall military commander in Mindanao, Espaldon's \\"Policy of Attraction\\" saw over 40,000 rebels lay down their arms, although some non-government and non-MNLF skeptics feel that these figures may have been overstated. Respected for both his competence and fairness, Espaldon had succeeded in persuading many MNLF personnel to accept amnesty and had reduced the level of fighting in the three Zamboanga provinces and in the Sulu archipelago. Many rebels also underwent officer training for integration into the AFP as part of its effort to restore peace in Mindanao. Amilpasa \\"Caloy\\" Bandaying, who once belonged to the elite Top 90 of the MNLF before his surrender, was designated by Espaldon as his aide-de-camp despite being cautioned by his officers at SOUTHCOM. Bandaying, in his article \\"The Bangsamoro Story (The Real Story Behind The Struggle),\\" would later write:left Before his retirement on December 31, 1980, he was conferred the honorary title of Sultan Makasanyang (Sultan of Peace) by the Muslim communities of Autonomous Region IX. The Citation reads: == Civilian career == In 1979, Espaldon was appointed as the first commissioner of the Commission on Islamic Affairs, which became the Ministry of Muslim Affairs in 1981. Under his leadership, the Philippine Shari'ah Institute was launched and spearheaded the translation of the Code of Muslim Personal Laws from English to Arabic, and the first Madrasa policy conference was held to discuss the integration of Madrasa-type education into the Philippine Educational System. He was also chairman of the Philippine Pilgrimage Authority and served as Amirul Hajj in 1981 and 1984. He likewise became active in civic organizations such as the Boy Scouts of the Philippines where he served as Vice-President from 1981 to 1984, and Lions Clubs International where he served as District Governor from 1983 to 1984. In 1990, he served as representative of the lone Legislative district of Tawi-Tawi during the 8th Congress of the Philippines after winning his election protest against Alawadin T. Bandon, Jr., making him the first elected representative of Tawi-Tawi. In the diplomatic service, Espaldon was appointed as Philippine Ambassador to Egypt, Sudan and Somalia from 1984 to 1986, and to Saudi Arabia and Yemen from 1993 to 1998. He was also appointed Honorary Ambassador-at-large to Guam in 1990. During his stint as envoy to Saudi Arabia, he often reminded embassy personnel that one of their primary objectives was to serve and protect Overseas Filipino Workers. His legacy and effectiveness as a peace negotiator was once again acknowledged when jihadist militant group Abu Sayyaf declared during the 2000 Sipadan Hostage Crisis that they would release three female hostages if the government agrees to have a new set of negotiators composed of Espaldon, Sen. Ramon Magsaysay Jr., and Sultan Rodinood Kiram. However, the request was turned down by the government. In 2003, he was advisor of a government panel that met with Prof. Shariff Julabbi, founder of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front splinter group Bangsamoro Mujahideen Alliance. == Notable career events == === Creation of Tawi-Tawi Province === Formerly part of the Province of Sulu, Tawi-Tawi became a separate province by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 302. Prior to issuing the decree, President Marcos had asked Espaldon, ‚ÄúWhy are the young boys of Tawi-Tawi easily wooed by the Moro National Liberation Front?‚Äù Espaldon replied, ‚ÄúThe Sama boys, like their elders and leaders, are tired and weary of their union with the Province of Sulu. They want to have their own leaders and manage their own affairs. If His Excellency wants to solve the problem, I recommend that he create them into a separate province and allow them to exercise their own local prerogatives.‚Äù Hence, Espaldon earned the moniker \\"Father of Tawi-Tawi.\\" === Surrender of the MNLF Magic Eight === In October 1973, then Commodore Espaldon received information that the so-called Magic Eight rebel commanders of the MNLF, composed of Abbas \\"Maas Bawang\\" Estino, Gerry Matba, Bagis Hassan, Ahmad Omar, Jairulla Abdurajak, Alih Abubakar and Tupay Loong, wanted to surrender to him, along with their 2,000 fighters. It was agreed that the rebels would be brought down from the hills to the shore of Panamao beach in Jolo, while Espaldon would anchor his ship about 500 yards from the shore and wait for the eight commanders to board the ship where the surrender ceremonies would take place. By noon time, none of the eight commanders had arrived at the ship. It was already afternoon when Kumander Maas Bawang arrived in a small pump boat. He requested to speak with Espaldon, and in the Tausug dialect, relayed the rebels' request for Espaldon to come ashore and personally accept their surrender. Despite the last-minute change in plan, Espaldon agreed. With a small pump boat and eight of his men, all unarmed, Espaldon arrived at the beach. The rebels rushed to Espaldon and his men and started embracing them, crying, and shouting that the government is sincere. === Highjacking of MV Don Carlos=== On April 30, 1978, MV Don Carlos of Sulpicio Lines was hijacked and its 56 hostages held captive by terrorists who demanded 700,000 pesos (nearly 20 million pesos in 2020) for their release. Later, the ransom demand was dropped in exchange for the release of some rebel prisoners, but the military also rejected this. ‚ÄúWe are ready to assist the Basilan terrorists provided they release the hostages without ransom,‚Äù Espaldon said. After 23 days of fighting with their captors on Basilan island, government forces finally obtained the release of all hostages. According to Sulpicio Lines vice-president BGen Emilio Alcoseba (ret.), the company did not pay a single centavo of ransom for the release of the 56 crew and passengers. ‚ÄúWithout the assistance of Admiral Espaldon and General Luga, the terrorists would not have been pressured into releasing the hostages,‚Äù he said. === Highjacking of Suehiro Maru === On September 26, 1975, Japanese freighter Suehiro Maru was hijacked in Zamboanga and its 29 crew members held hostage by some 40 terrorists who demanded $133,000 (nearly $700,000 in 2020) for their release. After considerable pressure from Espaldon who formed a blockade with a fleet of 11 Navy ships, the rebels progressively softened their demands and eventually offered to release the ship and the crew in return for safe passage without a single cent being paid as ransom. === Kidnapping of Eunice Diment === On February 28, 1976, British missionary- translator Eunice Diment, who was working among the Sama Banguingui, was kidnapped from a boat off Basilan Island by official action of the Basilan Revolutionary Committee of the MNLF's regional command in Basilan. She was released unharmed on March 17 with no ransom being paid. The Hong Kong-based Far Eastern Economic Review noted that reactions to her kidnapping were \\"a good example of how Espaldon and his officers work.\\" === Kidnapping of Pierre Huguet === On February 26, 1978, Pierre Huguet, a senior official in the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs, was abducted while holidaying in Zamboanga City. Huguet was taking photos of houses on stilts in Zamboanga Bay when he was pushed into the water by three rebels, pulled into a boat, and was held captive for $132,000 in ransom (over $500,000 in 2020) on Basilan island. A note saying \\"Please send the money immediately,\\" believed to have been dictated to Huguet by the kidnappers, was transmitted to his wife in Manila. Espaldon coordinated with French Ambassador Rapha√´l-L√©onard Touze regarding courses of action and eventually secured the peaceful release of Huguet without paying ransom, pursuant to government policy. However, the government reportedly paid for the \\"expenses\\" incurred by the guerrillas in keeping Huguet for two weeks as a concession. Espaldon would later be conferred the L√©gion d'honneur, the highest French order of merit. === Battle of Jolo === On February 7, 1974, government forces began a military offensive against MNLF forces that managed to take control of the municipality of Jolo, Sulu, resulting in a large number of civilian and military casualties and substantial damage to the municipality. Considering Espaldon's preferred \\"Policy of Attraction\\" which saw a period of rebel returnees reintegrating into the mainstream, he reportedly opposed military operation in Jolo but was apparently overruled by the central government. Espaldon would later be made part of the Executive Committee of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Rehabilitation of Jolo. In his article \\"February 7, 1974: The Jolo-caust,\\" eyewitness Said Sadain Jr. narrates: \\"I always gave Admiral Espaldon the benefit of the doubt since it was his naval boats that mercifully plucked us out of the teeming pier of Jolo island and transported us to Zamboanga City in mainland Mindanao.\\" Sadain Jr.'s narrative was cited by Dr. Michael Tan, former chancellor of University of the Philippines Diliman, in his article \\"From Jolo to Marawi\\": Citation from Jolo for Rear Admiral Espaldon Six years after the Battle of Jolo, the Municipality of Jolo presented a Citation to Espaldon which reads: == In the media == Rear Admiral Espaldon featured on the cover of Mr. & Ms. Espaldon appeared twice on the cover of Asiaweek. He also appeared in the March 1977 issue of National Geographic. In his article, Don Moser wrote:In January 1984, he was featured on the cover of Mr. & Ms., a weekly opposition tabloid magazine created in response to the Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr., and named as one of the 50 Most Capable To Lead. == Notable awards == Awards of Rear Admiral Espaldon === Foreign Awards === *alt= L√©gion d'honneur *alt= Bintang Yudha Dharma Pratama *alt= World War II Victory Medals *60x60px Asiatic‚ÄìPacific Campaign Medals *60x60px American Campaign Medal *USMMA Hall of Distinguished Graduates *USMMA Distinguished Service Award In June 2020, the Philippine Veterans Affairs Office confirmed that Espaldon is eligible and is awaiting to receive the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor conferred by the United States Congress, pursuant to the Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2015. === Philippine Awards === *60x60px Presidential Merit Award *60x60px Outstanding Achievement Medals *60x60px Distinguished Service Stars *60x60px Military Merit Medals *60x60px Presidential Unit Citations *60x60px Long Service Medals *60x60px Philippine Liberation Medal *60x60px Jolo Campaign Medal * Anti-Dissidence Campaign Medal * Doctor of Humanities honoris causa, Western Mindanao State University (1980) *Distinguished Achievement Award, National Defense College of the Philippines (1988) *Gerry Roxas Leadership Award *Aurora Aragon Quezon Award (1979) *Gintong Ama Award for Government and Public Service (1988) == Personal life == Espaldon was married to Eleanor Asistores whom he met on Polillo Island while his ship was assigned to patrol the eastern coast of Luzon.

He moved to Hollywood, California in his early 20s, and became a staff writer for United Artists Music Publishing. His first credit was songwriter of \\"Ten to Eight\\" from Helen Reddy's 1975 album, No Way to Treat a Lady, which was also used as the B-side to her \\"Somewhere in the Night\\" 7\\" single. His first A-side was \\"If You Feel the Way I Do\\" (co-written with Graham Dee), the lead track on the Lettermen's 1975 album, The Time Is Right. \\"He contributed to the ABC-TV Miniseries, Rich Man, Poor Man and participated in the \\"Great Golden Hits Of The Monkees\\" tour in 1976. ==Castle in the Sky== The following year, Castle became the first artist signed to Parachute Records, a new subsidiary of Casablanca Records headed by record mogul, Russ Regan.

Prieberg: Handbuch, After the Seizure of control by the Nazis he also belonged to the German Labour Front and the National Socialist People's Welfare Organization and wrote music criticism in the sense of the Nazi ideology. In April 1933, as chairman of the Dresden chapter of the Militant League for German Culture, he invited various music critics to a conference with papers on opera in the Third Reich.Fred K. Prieberg: Musik im NS-Staat. Fischer Taschenbuch-Verlag 1982, . In the new edition of his concert guide Oratorios and secular choral works he wrote in 1939: \\"The new spiritual Germany with its moving thoughts: people and leader, homeland, blood and soil, race, myth, heroic history, ethos of work, community of all creative folk comrades carries within it the old metaphysical longing for artistic idealization of its highest visual goods\\".Quoted after Joseph Wulf: Music in the Third Reich. A documentation. Ullstein, Frankfurt/ Berlin / VIenna 1983, , ; as an abbreviated quotation also in Ernst Klee: Kulturlexikon, . That Schnoor was not only a staunch Nazi, but also a fervent anti-Semit, is shown exemplarily by a review of the new edition of the Riemann Musiklexikon by Joseph M√ºller-Blattau, who deemed that Schnoor did not go far enough: : \\"How strong Riemann's beliefs since 1919, the year of his death, have been bent over with Jewish fixity, of which Alfred Einstein new editions in countless articles displays overwhelming evidence; in many cases the encyclopedia resembled a Jewish temple of fame. Now that the last possible separation between non-Jewish and Jewish in the realm of Adolf Hitler's empire was carried out in the areas of cultural, intellectual and scientific life, one might have expected a correspondingly radical departure from Einstein's editing practice in the new Riemann. But what happened? The whole of Judaism, which had settled into our culture over the past decades, has been given extensive tributes. [...] Thus stands a Herr Adolf Aber as \\"DJ\\" lies German Jew (!) in the new Riemann. This \\"German\\" Jew, a former Leipzig critic, now a London music wholesale dealer, is listed with all his \\"merits\\", even though even the Jewish musicological guild of the System Age had already noticed the lamentability of his publications, for example his Handbuch der Musikliteratur.Handbuch der Musikliteratur on WorldCatOne would have now, after he is listed in the Reich with all his \\"merits\\", even though this evil scientific impostor was morally destroyed by Alfred Heu√ü long before 1933 and was only held by a stubborn newspaper publisher for reasons of \\"prestige\\".Hans Schnoor: Peinliche Ehrenrettung des Riemann ‚Äì Deutsche Juden im neuen Musiklexikon, in the Dresdener Anzeiger, 14 March 1939, reprinted in Melos, 23rd year, 1956, September issue, Schnoor wrote for the NS magazine '. === Post-war period === After the Second World War, Schnoor remained in the Soviet occupation zone until 1948 and was able to publish a book there to mark the 400th anniversary of the S√§chsische Staatskapelle Dresden. In 1949 he moved to Bielefeld, where he became a music critic with the '. According to Fred K. Prieberg, Schnoor continued to write reviews \\"with anti-Semitic undertones and the vocabulary of Nazi journalism of yesteryear\\"Quote by Fred K. Prieberg: Music in the Nazi State. Fischer Taschenbuch, 1982, . The same could be said about several musicological books aimed at a broad audience, most of which Schnoor published at Bertelsmann. In his reference work Oper Operetta Concert, first published in 1955, Schnoor wrote about the Jewish composer Giacomo Meyerbeer that the classical ideals of music and art were foreign to him and that he understood music above all as a business. In doing so, he took up anti-Semitic resentments, which Richard Wagner, Meyerbeer and other Jewish composers had met.Hans Schnoor: Oper, Operette, Konzert. G√ºtersloh 1964, === 1956 Sch√∂nberg scandal === As a critic, Schnoor ignited a media scandal in June 1956, after he had torn Arnold Sch√∂nberg's Holocaust melodrama A Survivor from Warsaw in the Westfalen-blatt at a program announcement with the following words: \\"that disgusting play, which must be seem like a mockery to every decent German. To complete the measure of the challenging indecency, the conductor of this program, Hermann Scherchen (who else?) is placed next to the hate song of Sch√∂nberg Beethoven's music to Goethe's Egmont. How long is this going to go on?\\"Monika Boll: Nachtprogramm,[https://www.worldcat.org/title/nachtprogramm-intellektuelle- grundungsdebatten-in-der-fruhen- bundesrepublik/oclc/238182863&referer;=brief_results Nachtprogramm : intellektuelle Gr√ºndungsdebatten in der fr√ºhen Bundesrepublik on WorlddCat , quoted from the Westfalen-blatt dated 16 June 1956. A few days later, Schnoor attended a conference of the Evangelische Akademie f√ºr Rundfunk und Fernsehen in in the Taunus region as co-examiner of Winfried Zillig, where the establishment of a cultural programme on radio (\\"Third Programme\\") was on the agenda. In his lecture on the \\"Platz der Neuen Musik\\" (New Music Square), Zillig presented the work of his teacher Sch√∂nberg and at the end quoted the article by his co-examiner. Zillig refused a discussion with Schnoor and left the hall. When confronted, Schnoor made a half-hearted statement. Only two days later, a four-column article by Walter Dirks about the conference appeared in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, \\"Bericht √ºber ein Scherbengericht\\",The report was also reprinted in the July/August issue of the music magazine Melos, 23rd year, 1956 Bericht √ºber ein Scherbengericht , to which Schnoor wrote a counterstatement in the September issue (p. 263), which was replicated by Dirks with the text Scherbengericht Nr. 2 () which dealt exclusively with the Schnoor case. Dirks brought in the article another quote from Schnoor's column \\"Wir und der Funk\\" (We and the radio) of 29 October 1955, where Schnoor had denounced the alleged tyranny of re-emigrants in German radio stations and concluded: \\"Soon we will be able to talk more openly and precisely about all these things. There will be an uprising - not of the masses, but of the best.\\"Quote by Monika Boll: Nachtprogramm, . In his rejection of New Music, Dirks accused Schnoor of \\"anti-Semitic nationalism\\" and National Socialist ideas, coupled with the question of whether this would violate existing laws.Monika Boll: Nachtprogramm, . After Theodor W. Adorno had also joined the debate, further details became known. Schnoor, for example, had described Adorno in several critiques as the cause of the \\"Frankfurt poisoning\\" of the Westdeutscher Rundfunk and had called him \\"Wiesengrund\\" with his discarded name.Monika Boll: Nachtprogramm, : \\"apostrophized exclusively with his Jewish name\\". After the musicologist Fred K. Prieberg among other things accused him in a polemical broadcast on S√ºdwestfunk Baden-Baden of \\"National Socialist music criticism\\",Fred K. Prieberg: Music in the NS State, . Prieberg does not call himself by name, but describes himself as \\"an employee of the S√ºdwestfunk\\". Schnoor, supported by his publisher Hermann Stumpf, filed a private lawsuit. This lawsuit was dismissed in the first instance on the grounds that Schnoor had to put up with \\"that his crude attacks are answered in the same way\\".Fred K. Prieberg: Music in the NS State, as well as notes . An appeal by Schnoor in the next instance was again rejected. At the court ruling, Prieberg was granted the right to freedom of expression according to ¬ß 193 StGB and the assertion in Prieberg's S√ºdwestfunk broadcast that Schnoor's style was reminiscent of the expressions of \\"Das Schwarze Korps\\" was confirmed as a statement of fact.Monika Boll: Nachtprogramm, In 1958 Schnoor retired as editor,Fred K. Prieberg: Handbuch, . but continued to write music-historical works. In early 1962 he published the partly autobiographical book Harmony and Chaos. Musik der Gegenwart, in which he made no secret of his aversion to New Music and, among others, tore Stravinsky to pieces, but instead identified Richard Strauss and Hans Pfitzner as the most important composers of the 20th century.Josef M√ºller-Marein: Music has nothing to do with politics. in Die Zeit, Nr. 4/1962. Recension. He described the Sch√∂nberg scandal of 1956 as a \\"wave of reputation-killing actions\\" against his person.Hans Schnoor: Harmonie und Chaos, , quote .

Batanes has been represented in the country's various national legislatures since 1898. The first congressional delegation consisted of two members in the First Philippine Republic legislature known as the Malolos Congress. Since 1909 when it was re-established as a regular province separate from Cagayan, Batanes has been entitled to one member in the House of Representatives of the Philippines, elected provincewide at-large, except for a brief period between 1943 and 1944 when it was again eliminated and absorbed by Cagayan's at-large representation for the National Assembly of the Second Philippine Republic. From 1978 to 1984, all provinces were converted into multi-seat regional at- large districts for the Interim Batasang Pambansa of the Fourth Philippine Republic, with Batanes forming part of the seven-seat Region II's at-large district. It was restored as a single-member district in 1984. The district is currently represented in the 18th Congress by Ciriaco B. Gato Jr. of the Nationalist People's Coalition (NPC). ==Representation history== { class= - ! rowspan=2  # ! colspan=2  Term of office ! rowspan=2  National Assembly  rowspan=2  ! colspan=4  Seat A  rowspan=2  ! colspan=4  Seat B - style=\\"height:3em\\" !Start!!End ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  Member !

During a shipping strike, flying with 195 Squadron on 6 July 1943, his Typhoon was hit by flak and he crashed in the sea. ==References== Category:South African World War II flying aces Category:1914 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Royal Air Force personnel of World War II Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar (United Kingdom) Rabagliati Category:Royal Air Force squadron leaders ","title":"Alexander Rabagliati"},{"id":"63894414","text":"This article displays the rosters for the participating teams at the 1984 Tournament of the Americas played in S√£o Paulo, Brazil from May 15 to May 24, 1984. == == *4 Esteban Camisassa *5 Daniel Ar√©jula *6 Jorge Faggiano *7 Rub√©n Fern√°ndez *8 Carlos Romano *9 Sebasti√°n Uranga *10 Adolfo Perazzo *11 Miguel Cortijo *12 Eduardo Cadillac *13 Gabriel Milovich *14 Luis Oro√±o *15 Luis Gonz√°lez :*Head coach: Heriberto Schonwies == == *4 Nilo *5 S√≠lvio *6 Gerson *7 Carioquinha *8 Cadum *9 Marquinhos *10 Paulinho *11 Rolando *12 Adilson *13 Marcelo *14 Oscar *15 Israel :*Head coach: Cl√°udio Mortari == == *4 Howie Kelsey *5 Tony Simms *6 Eli Pasquale *7 Karl Tilleman *8 Gerald Kazanowski *9 Jay Triano *10 John Hatch *11 Gordon Herbert *12 Bill Wennington *13 Romel Raffin *14 Greg Wiltjer *15 Dan Meagher :*Head coach: / Jack Donohue == == *4 Pedro Abreu *5 Alberto Maturel *6 Roberto Sim√≥n *7 No√°ngel Luaces *8 Eduardo Cabrera *9 Ra√∫l Dubois *10 Leonardo P√©rez *11 Heriberto Lamerte *12 Tom√°s Herrera *13 Daniel Scott *14 Jorge Mor√© *15 F√©lix Morales :*Head coach: Pedro Chapp√© == == *4 M√°ximo Tapia *5 V√≠ctor Hansen *6 Evaristo P√©rez Carri√≥n *7 Luis Cruz *8 Tony S√°nchez *9 Jos√© Dom√≠nguez *10 Winston Royal *11 Vinicio Mu√±oz *12 V√≠ctor Chac√≥n *14 Jos√© Vargas *15 Juli√°n McKelly :*Head coach: Fernando Teruel == == *4 Rafael Pineda *5 V√≠ctor Flores *6 Julio Gallardo *7 Rafael Palomar *8 Guillermo Bayler *9 √ìscar Ruiz *10 Enrique Ortega *11 Antonio Esquivel *12 Arturo S√°nchez *13 Jos√© Luis Arroyos *14 Rafael Holgu√≠n *15 Norberto Mena :*Head coach: Gustavo Saggiante == == *4 Tito Malcolm *5 Eddy Ch√°vez *6 Enrique Grenald *7 Braulio Rivas *8 Mark Forbes *9 Alfonso Smith *10 Edgar Mac√≠as *11 Rolando Frazer *12 Rodolfo Gil *13 Cedric Bailey *14 Adolfo Medrick *15 Mario Butler :*Head coach: Carl Pirelli-Minetti == == *4 Orlando Marrero *5 Richie Hern√°ndez *6 Jos√© Sosa *7 Wesley Correa *8 Rub√©n Rodr√≠guez *9 Willie Qui√±ones *10 Angelo Cruz *11 √Ångel Santiago *12 Mario Morales *13 N√©stor Cora *14 Jerome Mincy *15 Jos√© Ortiz :*Head coach: Julio Toro == == *4 Horacio L√≥pez *5 Luis Larrosa *6 Luis Pierri *7 H√©bert N√∫√±ez *8 Wilfredo Ruiz *9 Horacio Perdomo *10 Carlos Peinado *11 Walter Pagani *12 Julio Pereyra *13 √Ålvaro Tito *14 Juan Mignone *15 V√≠ctor Frattini :*Head coach: Ram√≥n Etchamendi == Bibliography == * == External links == *1984 American Olympic Qualifying Tournament for Men at fiba.com Category:FIBA AmeriCup squads ","title":"1984 Tournament of the Americas squads"},{"id":"63894448","text":"Baldric de Segillo was Archdeacon of Leicester from 1163 to 1177.

He played college basketball at Arizona State. ==Early life== Oleka grew up in Washington, D.C. with his mother and brother. He played high school basketball at Florida Christian Institute in Cape Coral, Florida, where he averaged 24 points and 11 rebounds as a senior. He also played AAU ball with DC Assault. ==College career== ===State College of Florida, Manatee‚ÄìSarasota=== Coming out of high school, he was considered a three-star recruit by Rivals.com. However, he was academically ineligible to play for a major college, so he instead started playing JUCO ball at the State College of Florida, Manatee‚ÄìSarasota (SCF Manatee‚ÄìSarasota) in 2012. He was named NJCAA Division I Player of the Week for the week of February 18‚Äì24, 2013 after a dominant performance against Hillsborough Community College, in which he put up 32 points, 17 rebounds and 8 assists off the bench. During his second season, he signed a letter of intent (LOI) with the Texas Longhorns, also receiving interest from schools like Gonzaga, Old Dominion, Oregon State, Southern Miss, South Carolina, and Utah State. However, Oleka was suspended from his junior college team for violating team rules, only playing in five games (25.6 ppg, 13.6 rpg) of his sophomore season before leaving the school in December 2013. He was subsequently released from his LOI by Texas. He spent the 2014‚Äì15 season off from basketball while taking classes at Cecil College in North East, Maryland. ===Arizona State=== In the spring of 2015, nearly two years after playing his last competitive game, Oleka got a call from newly hired Arizona State head coach Bobby Hurley, and he was offered a scholarship to play NCAA Division I basketball for the Sun Devils. Oleka, who was ranked a top 20 JUCO recruit by jucorecruiting.com at the time, was also Hurley's first recruit after taking over the program in April. He made his debut as a Sun Devil against Sacramento State on November 13, 2015, 705 days after his last college basketball game. After almost two months on the bench, he permanently replaced third-year forward Savon Goodman in the starting-lineup in their second conference regular-season game against USC on January 7, 2016. In 32 games, he had averages of 9.6 points and 6.1 rebounds per contest while the Sun Devils lost in the quarterfinals of the 2015 Pac-12 Conference Tournament. In 2016‚Äì17, Oleka started all but one of the 33 games he played, averaging 12.5 points and 9.9 rebounds per game. Despite being 6‚Äô8, he played at center for much of the season in an undersized lineup, often playing with four guards. On February 26, 2017, he grabbed his 10th rebound of the game to seal a one-point upset of USC. It was his 15th double-double of the season, tying Ike Diogu for the most in school history since they joined the then-Pac-10 Conference in 1978. He broke the record two weeks later, when he posted a career-high 27 points and 13 rebounds in an overtime win against Stanford in the first round of the 2017 Pac-12 Conference Tournament. However, the Sun Devils lost by a score of 80‚Äì57 to Oregon, again in the quarterfinals, in what was Oleka's final college game. His 327 rebounds that year were the third-best mark in school history at the time. ==Professional career== Oleka played at the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament in April,2017 team rosters averaging 9.3 points and 8.7 rebounds per game. In May, he had pre-draft workout with the Utah Jazz, but went undrafted in the 2017 NBA draft Oleka signed with Italian Lega Basket Serie A team New Basket Brindisi in July. He played in a limited role off the bench for the club, appearing in 13 games and averaging 2.5 points and 2.8 rebounds per contest before leaving in January 2018. He joined Argentine team Argentino de Jun√≠n in October, replacing the outgoing Calvin Crawford. However, after playing only two games in the 2018 Torneo S√∫per 20 playoffs against Obras, Oleka was cut from the team the following month. He was then replaced by Leron Black. In December 2018, Oleka reached a deal to play with the St. John's Edge of the National Basketball League of Canada for the remainder of the 2018‚Äì19 season. He made his NBL Canada debut in a win over the Island Storm on December 14, adding 12 points and a team-leading 11 rebounds on the same night Glen \\"Big Baby\\" Davis made his Edge debut. Two days later, in a rematch against the Island Storm, Oleka scored 12 points off the bench and again led his team in rebounds with seven to extend their winning streak to three games after a 1‚Äì5 start. He grabbed a season-high 24 rebounds in a 109‚Äì100 victory at home against the London Lightning on January 19 for their sixth consecutive win. In 23 games with the Edge, he averaged 7.6 points and 10.4 rebounds in 24.8 minutes per game. He was the team's leading rebounder when he made the move to Gigantes de Jalisco, an expansion team in the Mexican Circuito de Baloncesto de la Costa del Pac√≠fico (CIBACOPA), in March 2019. The Gigantes opened their season with a loss to Tijuana Zonkeys on March 27, but defeated the Zonkeys 103‚Äì87 the following day for their historic first win. Oleka, a starter, recorded 20 points and 11 rebounds. He scored 31 points in Jalisco's home opener against Halcones de Ciudad Obreg√≥n on April 5 to lead them to an 83‚Äì75 win. He topped that mark by dropping 34 points in a win over Caballeros de Culiac√°n on April 23, and was selected to play in the 2019 CIBACOPA All- Star Game in Guadalajara in May. That summer, Oleka signed with Hungarian team KTE-Duna Aszfalt of the Nemzeti Bajnoks√°g I/A on a one-year contract. However, he did not appear in any games with the team, and instead joined newly- promoted Swedish Basketball League (SBL) club Djurg√•rdens. He made his league debut in a loss against K√∂ping Stars on October 4, contributing a game-high nine rebounds. Two games later, he notched his first double-double with 14 points and 12 rebounds against Ume√• BSKT. His season-high for points was 23 at Wetterbygden Stars on October 25, and his best rebounding game was on November 15 against S√∂dert√§lje Kings when he grabbed 18 boards. In 18 games played with Djurg√•rdens, Oleka averaged 10.9 points and 8.8 rebounds per contest. He ranked third in the league in rebounding, and Eurobasket.com named him an All- SBL honorable mention for the season. He parted ways with the team in January 2020. ==Career statistics== ===College=== -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"2015‚Äì16  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Arizona State  32  18  24.8  .395  .314  .777  6.1  0.7  .7  .5  9.6 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2016‚Äì17  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"Arizona State  33  32  32.9  .430  .253  .719  9.9  1.2  1.0  .8  12.5 -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Career  65  50  28.9  .415  .282  .719  8.0  .9  .8  .7  11.1 ==Personal life== Oleka is of Nigerian descent, and has a Nigerian passport.

In 1999, Viacom bought out United Television's interests, and handed responsibility for the start-up network to the newly acquired CBS unit, which Viacom bought in 1999 ‚Äì an ironic confluence of events as Paramount had once invested in CBS, and Viacom had once been the syndication arm of CBS as well. During this period the studio acquired some 30 TV stations to support the UPN network as well acquiring and merging in the assets of Republic Pictures, Spelling Television and Viacom Television, almost doubling the size of the studio's TV library. Lasting eleven years before being merged with The WB network to become The CW in 2006, UPN would feature many of the shows it originally produced for other networks, and would take numerous gambles on series such as Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise that would have otherwise either gone direct-to-cable or become first-run syndication to independent stations across the country (as Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: The Next Generation were). ==1990s== The original incarnation of Viacom purchased Paramount in 1993, with the deal closing in March 1994; Viacom then merged its own group of five CBS- and NBC-affiliated stations to the PSG fold. Shortly afterward Viacom entered into a joint venture with Chris-Craft Industries, which owned several television stations as part of its United Television subsidiary, to launch the United Paramount Network (UPN). Five of PSG's original six stations, along with several acquisitions such as WSBK-TV in Boston, became charter affiliates of the network when UPN launched in January 1995. PSG sold off two of its original six stations as well; KRRT and WTXF were sold to other companies, with the latter becoming a Fox-owned station. To make up for the loss of its Philadelphia-owned station, PSG bought Philadelphia independent station WGBS-TV and renamed it to WPSG-TV, and moved the UPN affiliation there. The company eventually divested itself of the CBS and NBC stations it held and purchased more UPN affiliates as the 1990s continued. ===1995=== This was the first season to feature the United Paramount Network and The WB Television Network, as both launched in January 1995. Both networks would ultimately shutdown and form The CW in September 2006. In January 1995, BHC Communications affiliated all of its stations, except the Salt Lake City and San Antonio outlets, with the newly launched United Paramount Network, which it fully owned and financed but ran with Paramount/Viacom, the network's producer. In December 1996, Paramount exercised its option to buy half of the Network by paying half of the losses ($160 million). Included in the deal was to continue selling UPN Star Trek: Voyager instead of placing it in syndication. When WWOR, channel 9 in New York City became a UPN affiliate in 1995, the WWOR EMI Service also covered up the network's shows, due to Paramount (although the network's sole owner-turned- half owner Chris-Craft owned the station) using syndication exclusivity to keep UPN's shows off the national WWOR feed‚Äîin contrast, rival superstation WGN carried programming from The WB Television Network on its national feed until nationwide terrestrial coverage was deemed sufficient to discontinue its carriage over the national WGN feed in October 1999. As a result of the syndication exclusivity claims by UPN, if New York City viewers of WWOR saw Star Trek: Voyager, cable viewers throughout the rest of the country saw Hazel reruns in the same timeslot. *Star Trek: Voyager originally aired from January 1995 to May 2001, lasting for 172 episodes over seven seasons. As Star Trek: The Next Generation ended, Paramount Pictures wanted to continue to have a second Star Trek TV series to accompany Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. The studio also planned to start a new television network, and wanted the new series to help it succeed. This was reminiscent of Paramount's earlier plans to launch its own network by showcasing Star Trek: Phase II in 1977. *Platypus Man aired from January 23 to July 10, 1995, during the network's first season.Carter, Bill (October 6, 1994). A New Network Hopes To Lure Fox Viewers. New York Times Starring comedian Richard Jeni, the television series was based on an hour-long HBO special of Jeni's filmed in 1992. The series lasted one season, with a total of thirteen episodes. *Pig Sty premiered on January 23 and was cancelled after just 13 episodes on May 15, 1995, during the network's disastrous first season. Pig Sty ran on Monday nights, after Star Trek: Voyager and Platypus Man. *Legend ran from April 18, 1995 until August 22, 1995, with one final re-airing of the pilot on July 3, 1996. Twelve episodes were aired, including the 2-hour pilot episode. Despite critical praise, this program aired during UPN's first year of existence and after a change in network management, along with lower than expected ratings, the show was canceled along with almost every other program aired on the UPN lineup. *Marker premiered on January 17 and ended on May 16, 1995. *The Watcher premiered on January 17, 1995 and ended on June 7, 1995, during the network's inaugural season. The series aired Tuesday night at 9:00p.m. Eastern time. The Watcher was one of five series that aired on UPN during its first year, joining other drama series Star Trek: Voyager and Marker and the sitcoms Pig Sty and Platypus Man. Like the latter three series, it was canceled following its one and only season. ===1996=== This is the first fall season for The WB and UPN. The schedules of either network would not be constant until fall 1999, when the WB decided to air shows from Sunday through Friday and UPN would air Monday through Friday. *In the House aired on NBC from April 1995 to May 1996 after which it was canceled due to low ratings. UPN quickly picked up In the House where it aired for an additional two seasons. UPN canceled the series for a final time in May 1998. *Nowhere Man aired every Monday night from August 28, 1995, to May 20, 1996, starring Bruce Greenwood. Despite critical acclaim, including TV Guides label of \\"This season's coolest hit,\\" the show was cancelled after one season. *Deadly Games appeared from September 5, 1995 to July 17, 1997 as part of its 1995 season. The series was produced by Viacom Productions. Much was made that Leonard Nimoy was executive producer, creative consultant and directed the pilot. *Live Shot aired from August 29, 1995 to January 9, 1996. Most notable in the show's run was an early use of an ongoing story arc centering on the murder of a Los Angeles socialite. As the show was canceled with little warning, the story arc was never resolved. Also, sports reporter Lou Waller came out of the closet in the last act of the last episode to air. Consequently, the fallout of this event was never shown. *Moesha aired from January 23, 1996, to May 14, 2001. It was originally ordered as a pilot for CBS' 1995‚Äì1996 television season but was rejected by the network. It was then picked up by UPN, which aired it as a mid-season replacement. It went on to become the biggest success for the nascent network and one of the greatest hits over the course of the network's entire run. By the sixth season, ratings for Moesha had dropped and UPN opted not to renew or air the series for a seventh season. The series ended on an unresolved cliffhanger with Myles being kidnapped by a rival of Dorian, Moesha considering moving in with Hakeem, and an unknown positive pregnancy test being found in the trash at Moesha's dorm room. Entertainment Weekly put out a rumour that certain plots were to be resolved on The Parkers, but those plans never came through, and the storylines were ultimately never resolved. *Minor Adjustments aired on NBC from September 16, 1995 until November 26, 1995, and on UPN from January 23, 1996 until June 4, 1996. *The Sentinel aired from March 20, 1996 to May 24, 1999. The Sentinel was canceled after 3 seasons by UPN, with the last episode being a big cliffhanger with Blair's life in the balance. An intense fan campaign convinced UPN to give the series a season of eight episodes to end the series properly. *Swift Justice for one season from March 13 to July 17, 1996. Critics noted Swift Justice's emphasis on violence, specifically in the pilot episode's opening sequence, comparing it to the crime drama The Equalizer (1985‚Äì1989) and the 1988 film Die Hard. UPN canceled the program after receiving complaints from viewers, advertisers, and critics of its violent scenes. Wolf considered the cancellation a mistake due to the show's good ratings. The series was praised for its visuals and McCaffrey's performance, but criticized as being either too violent or formulaic. Swift Justice was part of UPN's \\"aggressive new spring schedule\\" that expanded the network's programming to three nights per week. Picked up as a mid-season replacement, the series was broadcast on Wednesday nights at 9:00 pm EST. Thirteen episodes aired between March and July 1996. Rocky Mountain News' Dusty Saunders cited the series as an example of the network shifting toward action-adventure programming. Mediaweek's Scotty Dupree wrote that Swift Justice and The Sentinel were meant to attract a male audience, saying they were the only shows, aside from JAG, marketed to men on Wednesday nights. Wolf specified the target audiences of males as being aged 18 to 34. Swift Justices pilot episode was shown with a viewer advisory regarding its violence. During the show's broadcast, watchdog organizations and viewers were critical of the representation of violence on television. UPN canceled Swift Justice, Nowhere Man, Minor Adjustments, and The Paranormal Borderline, in favor of black sitcoms. The network decided to remove Swift Justice from its schedule following viewer and advertiser complaints about its violence. During a 2013 interview with the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, Dick Wolf referred to the decision to end Swift Justice as a \\"cancellation error\\", particularly since UPN did not have a drama with comparable ratings at the time. Following the show's cancellation, when Wolf was casting for the television productions Players and Exiled: A Law & Order Movie in the late 1990s, he again hired Ice-T, who has noted that Wolf often collaborated with the same actors. ===1997=== *Malcolm & Eddie premiered August 26, 1996 on UPN, and ran for four seasons, airing its final episode on May 22, 2000. *Goode Behavior premiered August 26, 1996, on UPN. The series was cancelled after one season, airing its last episode on May 19, 1997, for a total of 22 episodes. *Sparks aired from August 26, 1996, to March 2, 1998. The series stars James Avery, Robin Givens, Terrence Howard, Miguel A. N√∫√±ez Jr., Kym Whitley and Arif S. Kinchen. The sitcom is set in Compton, California, and is about the everyday lives of a family of lawyers running a family-owned law practice. *Homeboys in Outer Space aired from August 27, 1996 to May 13, 1997. The series was panned by critics and was canceled by UPN after one season. The series was later featured on TV Guide's List of the 50 Worst TV Shows of All Time. Significant criticism was levied towards the contrived pop culture references and celebrity cameos, and the NAACP criticized the ethnic stereotypes being played for laughs. *Social Studies aired from March 18 to April 22, 1997. *The Burning Zone aired for one season from September 3, 1996 to May 20, 1997. Critical response to The Burning Zone was primarily negative; commentators were divided over its storylines and tone. It received comparisons to other science-fiction properties, especially The X-Files. One of six shows ordered by UPN, The Burning Zone was the network's only new drama for the 1996‚Äì97 television season. It was the final program announced as a part of UPN's 1996-97 line-up. The Burning Zone was broadcast on Tuesday nights at 9 pm EST, airing with the sitcoms Moesha and Homeboys in Outer Space. UPN included references to The X-Files in the promotional materials for the show. In a University of California, Los Angeles report, senior fellow Harlan Lebo wrote that The Burning Zone is one of two shows, along with The Sentinel, in the 1996‚Äì97 television season that received complaints for its use of violence. The network canceled The Burning Zone, and rescheduled Tuesday nights with four additional sitcoms, including Clueless. ===1998=== In January 1998, United Television acquired a third UHF station in Baltimore for $80 million, changed its call letters to WUTB, and made the station a UPN affiliate. United, in October 1997, agreed to purchase WRBW (channel 65), a UHF station and UPN affiliate in Orlando, Florida, for $60 million and possible further considerations (WRBW was later acquired by Fox Television Stations after the BHC-News Corp. merger, and is now a MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station). In April 1998, United took a minority stake in Bohbot Entertainment & Media. *Good News aired from August 25, 1997 to May 19, 1998. It is also the final TV series to be produced by MTM Enterprises, before it was folded into 20th Century Fox Television. *Love Boat: The Next Wave aired from April 13, 1998 to May 21, 1999. It was a revival of the original 1977‚Äì1986 ABC television series The Love Boat. A reunion-themed episode reunited several cast members of the original The Love Boat ‚Äì Gavin MacLeod (Captain Stubing), Bernie Kopell (Dr. Adam \\"Doc\\" Bricker), Ted Lange (Isaac Washington), Jill Whelan (Vicki Stubing) and Lauren Tewes (Julie McCoy). This episode revealed that Julie and \\"Doc\\" had been in love all along.Mitchelmore, Pam (2005). \\"Reunion\\", Love Boat: The Next Wave. Epguides.com. *Clueless originally premiered on ABC on September 20, 1996, as a part of the TGIF lineup during its first season. The show then spent its last two seasons on UPN ending on May 25, 1999. After the series was canceled by ABC, the reruns of the episodes on their Friday night TGIF line-up proved to be ratings winners for ABC. However, it was too late for ABC to get the series back, and they prevented UPN from broadcasting the series until their contract ran out in late September. Clueless finished #46 in the ratings with 13.3 million viewers. Only Sabrina the Teenage Witch (a show on which Elisa Donovan and David Lascher would eventually become regulars) had higher ratings for Friday. Reportedly, the star of Sabrina, Melissa Joan Hart, was considered for the part of Cher on the Clueless TV series. UPN cancelled the show after the third season (1998‚Äì1999), reportedly because of sharply declining viewership. By the final season, the show had retained only 30% of its original 1996 viewing audience. *Hitz aired from August 26 until November 11, 1997. Although UPN had initially ordered 13 episodes, by October the network had ordered nine more episodes for a total of 22. However, by December the series was canceled before production on the last six episodes was complete. Caryn James of The New York Times called the series \\"relentlessly unfunny\\". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly rated the series as one of the worst of the year. *Head over Heels aired on from August 26 to October 28, 1997. The sitcom was the lowest-performing series tracked by Nielsen Holdings for the 1997‚Äì1998 television season. Since UPN primarily marketed its programming to African-American audiences, critics questioned the show's lack of a black main character. With its inclusion of Ian, Head Over Heels was one of 30 U.S. programs to feature a gay, lesbian or bisexual character that television season. It received a negative response from commentators, who criticized its sex comedy and characters. During production, Connie Stevens was set to play the Baldwins' mother in a recurring role. A writer for Turner Classic Movies described the show as \\"resurrect[ing] [Stevens'] acting career\\". Although United Paramount Network(UPN) had ordered Head Over Heels due to Stevens, the network removed her from the project following what it described as \\"a creative change\\". In the series' original pilot episode, the mother is the dating agency's original owner who passes it on to her sons. A \\"cavorting bimbo of a mother\\", she has a relationship with a Hispanic personal trainer and frequently talks about having sex with him. References to the dating company's history and the Baldwins' involvement were removed from the series. For the second version of the pilot, LaRue was added to the show after her character (Maria Santos) was removed from the soap opera All My Children. UPN ordered three new sitcoms for the 1997‚Äì1998 television season: Head Over Heels, Hitz, and Good News. They were part of the network's decision to expand its prime-time schedule to four nights a week. Although UPN targeted its programming at African-American audiences, Head Over Heels does not feature a black actor. Network president Dean Valentine denied accusations from \\"industry observers\\" that he was \\"abandoning the black audience or turning down projects featuring black stars and producers\\". Airing after Hitz, Head Over Heels was broadcast on Tuesdays at 9:30pmEST; it was originally scheduled for 8:30pm. The series had a TV-PGparental rating for suggestive language and sexual situations; the Deseret News' Scott Pierce felt that it should have received a TV-14 rating for its sexual content. The series attracted a weekly average of 2.3million viewers It tied with Alright Already as the lowest- performing show (tracked by Nielsen Holdings) of the season. The overall viewing figures for both shows was 2.7million viewers. Head Over Heels was the first casualty of the 1997‚Äì1998 season. Although 13 episodes were ordered, only eight were broadcast. Despite reports that the series would air through November, its final episode was shown on October 28, 1997. Dobson and Whitfield appeared in all eight episodes, Bristow appeared in seven, and Ambuehl and LaRue appeared in four. ===1999=== In 1999, Viacom announced plans to merge with CBS Corporation. Because of a regulation upheld by the FCC years ago, prohibiting companies from owning two broadcast networks. Viacom's announcement raised questions regarding the future of Chris-Craft and Viacom's joint ownership of UPN. In Viacom and Chris-Craft's original agreement, two options for exiting the partnership had been determined‚Äîbuying out the other partner or paying for what the partner had invested up to that date and providing funds for the future operation of UPN. Either option would cost Viacom substantial sums of money. Industry analysts agreed that Chris-Craft could emerge the winner and offered other possible scenarios‚Äîthat Viacom might offer Chris-Craft some of its stations in exchange for severing the partnership or that Chris-Craft might sell Viacom's share to another company. However, after the Viacom-CBS merger was completed in 2000, a lawsuit was filed by BHC against the Viacom-CBS merger as BHC saw this as a breach of the UPN partnership. BHC lost the suit and sold its remaining ownership in UPN to Viacom for $5 million. Shortly thereafter, Chris-Craft announced that it was getting out of broadcasting after losing $500 million on UPN, the possibility of UPN shutting down or having their affiliation pulled. Many industry observers thought Viacom would end up getting the stations, but Viacom's bid lost out to News Corporation's Fox Television Stations, resulting in a sale which closed on July 31, 2001. *Guys Like Us aired from October 5, 1998 to January 18, 1999. Due to low ratings, UPN cancelled the show after its first season. *DiResta premiered on October 5, 1998, on its Monday schedule. It was cancelled after its March 1, 1999 airing. The show was named for stand-up comedian John DiResta; this was his first television venture. The series was described by Entertainment Weekly as \\"A transit cop, his funny job, and his funny family.\\"Entertainment Weekly - Fall TV Preview/ DiResta - 09-10-1998 On the week of November 2‚Äì8, 1998, was the lowest rated non-PAX network show aired.Nielsen Ratings - Nov 2 - 8 *The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer aired from October 5‚Äì28, 1998. Before it was even debuted, the series set off a storm of controversy because of a perceived light-hearted take on the issue of American slavery. Before the series' premiere, several African American activist groups, including the Los Angeles area NAACP, protested against the premise of the series. On September 24, 1998, a protest against the series was held outside Paramount Studios. Five days later, UPN released a statement regarding the controversy and stated that the network planned on delaying the controversial pilot episode (which never aired) and would instead air an alternate episode in its place. The first episode of the series aired on October 5, 1998, ranking 116th out of 125 television programs for that week. Desmond Pfeiffer was removed from UPN's schedule on October 24 and, after airing one episode two days after being removed from UPN's lineup, was canceled. It was ranked #5 on Entertainment Weekly's Top 50 TV Bombs.TV's Biggest Blunders Ever - CBS News *The first episode of Dilbert was broadcast on January 25, 1999, and was UPN's highest-rated comedy series premiere at that point in the network's history; it lasted two seasons with thirty episodes on UPN and won a Primetime Emmy before its cancellation. Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, decided to create the series for UPN because the network promised 13 episodes on air, while other networks would only consider the series against other programming options. Adams added to that \\"If we had gone with NBC, they would have given Dilbert a love interest with sexual tension.\\" UPN was the sixth-ranked network at the time and picked up the show in hopes of broadening their appeal and to prove they were committed to riskier alternative shows. Adams stated about turning Dilbert into a series \\"It's a very freeing experience because doing the comic strip limits me to three (picture) panels with four lines or less of dialogue per issue, in the TV series, I have 21 minutes per episode to be funny. I can follow a theme from beginning to end, which will add lots of richness to the characters.\\" Adams wanted the series to be animated because the live action version shot previously for FOX didn't translate well. Adams added to that \\"If Dilbert's going to be at the top of the Alps, you just draw it that way and you don't have to build an Alps scene. You can also violate some laws of physics, and cause and effect. People forgive it very easily. So it's much more freeing creatively.\\" On November 22, 2006, when Adams was asked why the show was canceled, he explained: *Home Movies premiered on April 26, 1999. UPN cancelled the series after only five episodes due to low ratings, but Cartoon Network purchased the rights to the series, seeing potential in it; the show premiered as the first original program on their nighttime adult-oriented Adult Swim block on the night of the block's launch on September 2, 2001. The series ended on April 4, 2004, with a total of 52 episodes over the course of four seasons. *Power Play aired on CTV from 1998 to 2000. The series was filmed at Copps Coliseum (now FirstOntario Centre) in Hamilton, Ontario. The show was briefly aired on the United States broadcast network UPN, starting in 1999, but was pulled after just two episodes. The second episode aired in the United States has the distinction of being the lowest-rated episode (since the Nielsen ratings service began in the 1950s) of any prime-time TV series ever aired by any United States network. *Seven Days was produced from October 7, 1998 to May 29, 2001. Three seasons of Seven Days were produced. Seven Days was based on an idea from Kerry McCluggage, then-president of Paramount Television. He pitched the idea to Christopher Crowe, who mixed it with his own research on Area 51 to create the series. The show wasn't a hit with reviewers, who criticized the show's \\"flimsy\\" premise and violence. Justina Vail, who played Dr. Olga Vukavitch, quit the series before the end of the third season, though she agreed to film a few extra scenes to wrap-up her character's arc. Her departure and the tensions within the cast, as well as the show's low ratings, played a role in UPN's decision to not renew the series for a fourth season. *Between Brothers premiered on September 11, 1997 on Fox, with the second season airing on UPN, until March 2, 1999. *Mercy Point originally aired for one season from October 6, 1998, to July 15, 1999. According to a press release from UPN, the series features the characters' attempts to \\"balance complicated personal lives with the demands of working in a cutting-edge hospital\\". During production, Trey Callaway imagined the series as a \\"companion piece\\" to Star Trek: Voyager, with the hope that it would have a shared viewership. Even though elements of \\"Nightingale One\\" were kept, Callaway said that \\"[he] really started over again and reconceived it completely as a series from the ground up\\". Prior to the series being officially green-lit, Callaway collaborated with writer David Simkins to prepare a presentation of a \\"low-budgeted 30 minute\\" pilot. Simkins did not work on the series after his pilot, but his contributions earned him a credit as one of its co-creators. John de Lancie, who was noted for acting as Q in Star Trek: The Next Generation, had essayed the role of DeMilla, and Steve Johnson designed the non-humanoid aliens. The pilot presentation was filmed in Los Angeles, but the sets were completely renovated for the series' episodes. Three non-humanoid characters, including ANI and Batung, were added to the show following this presentation. UPN executives responded positively to the presentation, and ordered thirteen episodes of the series, which was considered a \\"half-season's worth\\". Mercy Point was one of four shows produced by Mandalay Television that appeared in the 1998‚Äì99 United States television schedule, alongside Cupid, Rude Awakening, and Oh Baby. The show's production was part of a three-million-dollar deal with Columbia TriStar Television to produce 200 hours of material; a majority of the content created from this agreement was commercially unsuccessful. Mercy Point was placed on hiatus after only three episodes were aired, and was replaced by the reality television series America's Greatest Pets and the sitcom Reunited. The show suffered from low ratings, with an average of two million viewers. The final four episodes of the series were broadcast in two 2-hour blocks on Thursday nights in July 1999. Critical response to Mercy Point was mixed; some commentators praised its characterization and use of science-fiction elements, while others found it to be uninteresting and unoriginal. Callaway said he was surprised by UPN's cancellation of Mercy Point because of their strong support of the show. He felt the decision was made in part because of the show's high production costs. He also concluded that the decision to broadcast the pilot at the same time as the World Series resulted in the loss of Mercy Points target audience. To better connect with UPN's teen viewers, Callaway shifted the show's focus from medical and ethical cases to the characters' relationships. Despite these revisions, he said that UPN executives preferred to air shows like Moesha over science-fiction programs. When UPN announced the show's cancellation, the eighth episode was in the middle of production. Scenes originally written for the episode were revised and edited into the seventh episode to form a complete series finale. *Reunited aired from October 27 until December 29, 1998. At the time, it was one of the lowest-rated programs ever tabulated, with an average 0.9 Nielsen rating, which meant around 885,000 viewers watched it every week. *Family Rules aired from March 9, 1999 to April 13, 1999. *Legacy aired for eighteen episodes from 1998‚Äì99. ==2000s== ===2000=== During the late 1990s, United Paramount Network produced a number of television films branded \\"Blockbuster Shockwave Cinema,\\" in conjunction with sponsor (and sister company) Blockbuster Video. Almost all were science fiction films, and likewise, their after-airing availability on home video was exclusive to Blockbuster stores. From UPN's inception until 2000, the network also offered a hosted movie series called the UPN Movie Trailer to their stations. The show featured mostly older Hollywood action and comedy films, often those made by Paramount Pictures. Movie Trailer was discontinued in 2000 to give stations that opted for them room for a second weekend run of Star Trek: Enterprise and America's Next Top Model (and later, Veronica Mars). There were also three Paramount-branded blocks on the company's owned-and-operated stations (\\"O&Os;\\") only: Paramount Teleplex as the main brand for movies at any given timeslot, Paramount Prime Movie for primetime features, and the Paramount Late Movie on late nights. *The Parkers aired from August 30, 1999, to May 10, 2004. Given her popularity for four seasons on Moesha, Countess Vaughn left the show for her own spin-off. It centered on the adventures of Kim attending community college with her mother, played by comedian Mo'Nique. Leaving Moesha, Yvette Wilson joined the cast of The Parkers as Andell Wilkerson, Nikki's childhood best friend, in 2000. Several Moesha cast members (including Brandy Norwood) made crossover appearances on The Parkers. Though not direct spin-offs of Moesha, the shows Girlfriends and The Game were created by Moesha writer Mara Brock Akil and exist in the same universe as Moesha. The character Maya Wilkes (Golden Brooks) from Girlfriends lives in Leimert Park like the characters of Moesha, and appeared in an episode babysitting for her sister-in-law Barbara Lee, who happened to be Dorian's birth mother. Niecy later appeared in an episode of Girlfriends. *Grown Ups premiered on August 1, 1999 at 8:30 EST/7:30 CST. On August 30, 1999, the series moved to Mondays at 9p.m. EST/8p.m. CST, following the Moesha spin-off The Parkers. The series initially garnered good ratings, but ratings soon dropped and UPN canceled the series (on a cliffhanger that was never resolved) in May 2000. *Shasta McNasty aired during the 1999‚Äì2000 season. A sneak preview of the series after UPN's highly rated WWF SmackDown! drew 4.52 million viewers. However, when the series was moved to its scheduled 8p.m. timeslot, ratings dropped. Halfway through the first season, UPN shortened the show's title to Shasta, and the series was canceled after its first season. Although Shasta McNasty premiered with less-than-favorable reviews from critics, the program was nominated for a People's Choice Award for best new comedy. *The Strip aired from October 12, 1999 to July 7, 2000, during the 1999‚Äì2000 television season. The series was cancelled after nine episodes, with a tenth episode airing months later in July 2000. *I Dare You: The Ultimate Challenge aired from January 17, 2000 to May 30, 2000. *Secret Agent Man aired from March 7, 2000 to July 28, 2000. Secret Agent Man was originally scheduled to premiere on UPN in September 1999, but was pushed back to a midseason premiere in August 2000 due to the desire to give the show's producers more time to work on props and special effects. It also did not have a traditional one-hour pilot filmed, and was instead ordered to series by UPN on the strength of just a presentation reel. Only 12 episodes were produced and broadcast before the series was cancelled due to poor ratings. *The Beat premiered on March 21, 2000 and ended after only six episodes a month later on April 25. Seven additional episodes were produced although they have never aired. *WWF SmackDown! was set up to compete against WCW's Thursday night show, Thunder. SmackDown! first appeared on April 29, 1999 using the Raw set as a single television special on UPN. On August 26, 1999, SmackDown! officially debuted on UPN. Like WCW Thunder, SmackDown! was recorded on Tuesdays and then broadcast on Thursdays. The new WWF show was so popular that WCW moved Thunder to Wednesdays so that it would not compete directly. Throughout the show's early existence, The Rock routinely called SmackDown! \\"his show\\", in reference to the fact that the name was derived from one of his catchphrases, \\"Lay the smack down\\". In March 2002, WWF implemented the \\"brand extension\\", under which Raw and SmackDown! would have separate rosters of performers that are exclusive to their respective programs and events, and be positioned in-universe as competing \\"brands\\" (in a manner reminiscent of athletic conferences). In the 2004‚Äì05 season, SmackDown had an average viewership of 5.1 million viewers, making it UPN's second-highest-rated series behind America's Next Top Model. With the cancellation of Star Trek: Enterprise, SmackDown moved into its former timeslot on Friday nights for the 2005‚Äì06 season, beginning September 9, 2005. WWE subsequently announced that the show would be renamed Friday Night SmackDown! to emphasize the new scheduling. ===2001=== *The Hughleys spent two seasons on ABC. In its first season, it followed Home Improvement, but was canceled when ABC decided to revamp its TGIF lineup. UPN picked up the show in the fall of 2000 and it aired in the Monday night lineup along Moesha, The Parkers and Girlfriends. While The Parkers and Girlfriends had improved ratings, The Hughleys aired its series finale after its fourth season. The Hughleys ended with a two-part series finale entitled \\"It's a Girl!\\" (aired on May 13 and May 20, 2002). *Girlfriends debuted on Monday September 11, 2000. After airing for several years on the network at 9/8C on Mondays, The CW moved Girlfriends to Sundays at 8/7C. The ratings plummeted. On October 9, 2006, Girlfriends, along with The CW's other African-American programs, moved back to Mondays. At this point, Girlfriends returned to its original time slot. While UPN was still airing new episodes of Girlfriends, the network also began airing reruns five days per week. When the show moved to The CW network after UPN merged with The WB network, MyNetwork TV (which was created to take over UPN's former affiliate stations) picked up the rights to air reruns of Girlfriends, although they eventually discontinued this. WE tv, a network with primarily women's programming, later acquired exclusive rights to air the limited- release episodes on Sundays and exercised an option to not allow broadcast television networks re-broadcast rights to these reruns. The final two episodes recorded before the 2007‚Äì08 Writers Guild of America strike aired back-to-back on Monday, February 11 at 9/8c. However, this was not a 2-part episode. The timeslot was planned to be moved to Sundays due to the writer's strike and the returning of The CW's reality series. On February 13, 2008, it was announced by a The CW representative that a proper series finale would not be done because it would be too expensive, also confirming the show's cancellation. A retrospective episode was to be aired on The CW Network to conclude the eight-year series. However, the characters' storylines would receive no resolutions as the retrospective/series finale did not come to pass. The network offered the actors only half of their usual episodic salary to take part, and the actors collectively turned them down. *Freedom aired from October 27 to December 22, 2000. There were 13 episodes filmed, including the original pilot, but only 7 episodes were aired in the United States. *Chains of Love aired for six episodes in April‚ÄìMay 2001. Chains of Love was originally ordered by NBC, before UPN began producing it. The program was produced as part of a campaign to have more unscripted programming in UPN's schedule to boost the network's ratings. UPN executives associated the rise in interest in unscripted content as connected to its low production costs compared to scripted programming and its appeal to a younger demographic. Network president Dean Valentine explained: From a societal view, audiences, especially young people, are finding it harder and harder to relate to fictional storytelling ‚Äì it just seems fake to them.The network's entertainment chief Tom Nunan said the series was intended to improve the network's ratings, explaining: \\"There's a wave of television viewer right now that is very clear to us ‚Äì it shows that audiences seem to be responding to these event programs that don't feel like cookie-cutter TV.\\" Media outlets have identified Chains of Love as part of a renaissance in reality television. Before its premiere, UPN had promoted the series through a month-long online campaign aimed at young women. Initially broadcast on Tuesday nights at 8:00 pm EST, the network envisioned the show as a companion piece to the simulated fugitive-chase series Manhunt. Media outlets questioned whether the show's airing on network television had restricted its content. Critical feedback to Chains of Love was mixed, the show's premise dividing television critics. Its structure and tone were compared to other programs where contestants seek love partners, such as Blind Date and The Dating Game. Chains of Love was one of three series that debuted on UPN during the 2000‚Äì01 US television schedule as a mid-season replacement; the other two were Special Unit 2 and All Souls. Chains of Love was broadcast initially on Tuesday nights at 8:00 pm EST, premiering on April 17, 2001. UPN picked it up originally as a companion piece to the 2001 Manhunt, in which pretend fugitives ran away from actors posing as bounty hunters. During its broadcast, Chains of Love was briefly paired with All Souls, which UPN placed on a hiatus after two episodes were aired. Before the show's debut, the network had conducted a month-long online promotional campaign. The advertisements, specifically aimed at women from the ages of 12 to 34 years old, appeared on the websites Targetmatch.com, Madhive.com, and Ecrush.com. The Marina del Rey-based marketing firm L90, who had previously done work for UPN for the series Gary & Mike, created the campaign. Lauren Kay, the company's vice president of marketing, said that for the show they put together a \\"clean simple branding program\\" using pop-up ads, flash animation, and a sweepstake done through a microsite. Media outlets questioned whether the show's broadcast on network television had a limited impact on its more mature content. Carman identified a scene as confusing in which the Picker suggested skinny-dipping in a hot tub to the four women, followed by a shot of them appearing in swimsuits. Peyser equated the sexual content with that of Dawson's Creek, and wrote that it was not as explicit as he had first imagined. *All Souls originally aired for one season on UPN from April 17, 2001, to August 31, 2001. UPN executives had pitched the series as following \\"young doctors in peril at a haunted old Boston Hospital\\" who must contend with \\"a healthy dose of terrifying paranormal occurrences and gripping medical emergencies\\". The series had originated from a production deal between Syfy and CBS Paramount Network Television. Thomas Vitale, the senior vice president of programming and original movies for Syfy, described the partnership as a way to add more \\"genre programming to our schedule\\". It was one of three series (alongside Chains of Love and Special Unit 2) UPN ordered as mid-season replacements during the 2000 ‚Äì2001 television season. The network had requested six episodes of All Souls when picking it up for air, and all of them had been shot before its cancellation. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer's John Levesque felt that the network decided to produce All Souls in an attempt to find another successful series following the end of Star Trek: Voyager. While Levesque thought the shows were \\"promising\\", he did not believe any of them were a \\"slam-dunk\\". All Souls had low viewership, and was placed on hiatus following the broadcast of the first two episodes and canceled after the season was broadcast. Critical response to All Souls was primarily positive; commentators praised its use of horror and paranormal elements. All Souls was initially broadcast on Tuesday nights at 9 pm EST, and aired directly after the reality television show Chains of Love. The series carried a TV-PG parental rating, meaning it was judged \\"unsuitable for young children\\". It premiered on April 17, 2001, and was viewed by 2.1 million people; Nielsen Media Research ranked it 105th for the week. UPN placed the series on hiatus on April 30, 2001, due to concerns about its low ratings; only two episodes had aired. After announcing the show's hiatus, UPN executives said it was not canceled at that point. Despite the network's claims, media commentators believed it would be removed from air following its poor performance. The series returned in August and the pilot and remaining episodes aired on Friday nights at 9 pm EST, and were burned off throughout August, with the last one airing on August 31, 2001. One rerun aired during the month of September. Overall, All Souls was broadcast for a total of 360 minutes. While discussing the cancellation, McCouch felt it was \\"doomed to fail\\" from the beginning and referred to UPN as \\"a loser network at that time\\" due its treatment of the series. Cosgrove disagreed with McCouch's sentiment and believed the show's lack of success was not tied to the network specifically. Rodriquez believed All Souls was unsuccessful as it was \\"just a little ahead of its time\\"; he felt that the program was better suited for television one to two years following its initial broadcast. The series has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or licensed to on an online-streaming service. Critics had mixed reviews for the show's content and style when compared to other horror and science-fiction television series, specifically The X-Files and the work of American writer Stephen King. *Special Unit 2 is an American sci-fi/comedy television series that aired on UPN for two seasons from April 11, 2001 through February 13, 2002. *Gary & Mike aired on UPN in 2001 and Comedy Central in 2003. The show was produced in stop motion clay animation and lasted only one season. A total of thirteen episodes were produced. The series was initially proposed to Fox, but was eventually passed over to UPN. UPN had aired the episodes out of order, leading to inconsistencies within the plot serialization (save for the production placement of the third and fourth episodes). Although the final episode included a \\"to be continued\\" message, the show was canceled after its first season. According to co-creator Adam Small, 10 more episodes were planned for the second season. The cancellation was actually a result of the financial issues UPN was facing at the time rather than a ratings issue. *Two television pilots of Celebrity Deathmatch were broadcast on MTV on January 1 and 25, 1998. The series proper premiered on May 14, 1998, and ended on June 6, 2002, airing for 75 episodes. A television special, Celebrity Deathmatch Hits Germany, aired on June 21, 2001. For a brief period during that year, reruns of the series aired on broadcast network UPN.Awn.com *One on One aired from September 3, 2001, to May 15, 2006. The show was cancelled months before The WB and UPN merged to form The CW. The cancellation was blamed on Dawn Ostroff's decision on completely changing the show for season 5 in order to cater to a different audience rather than the audience the show had built over the years with great ratings ‚Äì this change led the decline in ratings in the fifth season and UPN's decision not to renew for a season six. The show would also have a spin-off series Cuts, which follows Flex's little brother Kevin Barnes running the local barbershop/day spa with a spoiled brat named Tiffany Sherwood after her father Jack Sherwood purchased the shop. The show premiered as a mid-season replacement during the 2004‚Äì2005 television season. The show lasted for only two seasons and was also canceled when UPN and The WB merged to form The CW. ===2002=== *Buffy the Vampire Slayer first aired on March 10, 1997, (as a mid season replacement for the show Savannah) on the WB network, and played a key role in the growth of the Warner Bros. television network in its early years. In the 2001‚Äì2002 season, the show had moved to UPN after a negotiation dispute with The WB. While it was still one of the highest rated shows on their network, The WB felt that the show had already peaked and was not worth giving a salary increase to the cast and crew. UPN on the other hand had strong faith in the series and picked it up for a two-season renewal. UPN dedicated a two-hour premiere to the series to help re-launch it. The relaunching had an effect, as the season premiere attracted the second highest rating of the series, with 7.7 million viewers. Buffy helped put The WB on the ratings map, but by the time the series landed on UPN in 2001, viewing figures had fallen. The series' high came during the third season, with 5.3 million viewers (including repeats). This was probably due to the fact that both Sarah Michelle Gellar and Alyson Hannigan had hit movies out during the season (Cruel Intentions and American Pie respectively). The series' low was in season one at 3.7 million. The show's series finale \\"Chosen\\" pulled in a season high of 4.9 million viewers on the UPN network. *Roswell premiered on October 6, 1999, on The WB Television Network in the United States to generally favorable reviews, and it quickly gained an outspoken fanbase. In response to the problems the series had with ratings during its first season, the relationship-driven stand-alone episodes of the early first season were to be replaced with more science fiction themes and multi-episode plot arcs. Starting with the second season, after a fierce fan-driven campaign involving bottles of Tabasco sauce‚Äîa favorite condiment of the show's alien characters‚Äîbeing sent to the network's offices, veteran science fiction writer Ronald D. Moore was brought in to join Katims as an executive producer and showrunner and to further develop the science fiction elements of the show. Not all fans responded favorably to the shift to more science fiction-driven storylines during the second season and the ratings continued to disappoint, causing the network to finally cancel the show on May 15, 2001, after the show's second-season finale, a move widely anticipated due to the sagging ratings. 20th Century Fox (the studio that produced the show) was able to persuade UPN to pick it up for a third season as a package deal when UPN outbid The WB for one of its popular flagship series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer. During the 2001 - 2002 television season, Roswell, in its third season, aired directly after Buffy on Tuesday nights on UPN, though it was unable to hold on to the audience Buffy provided as a lead-in. This eventually resulted in the show's cancellation from UPN as well. *As If aired for two weeks, on March 5 and 12, 2002. It served as a midseason replacement for Roswell and aired on Tuesdays after Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The series was a part of the network's Tuesday evening 9p.m. ET/PT timeslot, which outside of a couple exceptions, was terminally troubled due to The WB and Fox's much better ratings on the evening. Seven episodes were produced, but due to low ratings, As If only aired twice before its cancelation. *The Random Years aired on from March 5 to 19, 2002. The show, developed under the working title Life as We Know It, was produced by Big Phone Productions in association with Paramount Television. It was shown as a mid-season replacement, alongside the dramedy As If, to fill the timeslot previously occupied by the science fiction television show Roswell. The Random Years was commercially unsuccessful, and was canceled after three weeks. Seven episodes were produced, but only four aired. Critical response to the series was mixed, though some critics had positive comments about the cast. In January 2002, the United Paramount Network (UPN) organized panels on its then-upcoming programs, which involved their writers and cast members. The Random Years was one of the shows discussed. Television executive Les Moonves said the programs were scheduled for spring and summer releases. Premiering alongside the dramedy As If, The Random Years was broadcast on Tuesday nights at 9 pm EST; the pilot episode was watched by 1.4 million viewers. The series had a TV 14 parental rating, indicating that it was \\"unsuitable for children under 14 years of age\\". UPN aired As If and The Random Years as mid-season replacements to occupy the timeslot previously filled by science fiction television show Roswell. The Random Years was one of the lowest-performing shows tracked by Nielsen Holdings, and it was canceled after three weeks. Seven episodes were filmed, though only four were aired. *Star Trek: Enterprise originally aired from September 26, 2001, to May 13, 2005 spanning 98 episodes across four seasons. Following the culmination of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and with Star Trek: Voyager scheduled to end, UPN asked Braga and Berman to devise a new series to continue the franchise. Rather than setting it in the 24th century alongside Deep Space Nine and Voyager, the duo decided to set Enterprise in an earlier period, allowing them to explore new parts of the Star Trek fictional universe. Prior to the end of Star Trek: Voyager and following the end of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine on June 1999, UPN approached Rick Berman and Brannon Braga about the production of a fifth Star Trek series, either to overlap with the final season of Voyager or to immediately follow. Berman had previously created Star Trek: Deep Space Nine alongside Michael Piller, Voyager with Piller and Jeri Taylor, and had been wanting to work with Braga on a series concept. While the fans online were suggesting that it could either be based on Starfleet Academy or the adventures of Hikaru Sulu, the producers took care that no information was leaked to reveal what the concept was going to be. They later revealed that the Academy idea was never properly considered. Instead, they opted to create a prequel to The Original Series which is set after the events in the film Star Trek: First Contact, as Braga and Berman felt it was a period in the Star Trek universe which was unexplored. Midway through the third season, from \\"Exile\\" onwards, the series started to be broadcast in 1080i High-definition television. Alongside Jake 2.0, it was one of the first two series on UPN to be broadcast in high-definition. The show contains over 4,214 minutes of special effects, dialogue, and other scenes. The series was considered for cancellation at the end of the second season, with Paramount executives instead requesting a number of changes to Enterprise in order to renew it following a letter writing campaign from fans. These included a change of name to Star Trek: Enterprise early in the third season and a new action-oriented plot, which resulted in the development of the Xindi. There was a major turn over of staff at Paramount in June 2004, with Jonathan Dolgen, the head of entertainment at parent company Viacom, quitting following the departure of Viacom President Mel Karmazin. Dolgen was described by Bakula as being the \\"huge Star Trek guy\\" at Paramount, and his departure was followed by several other staff members leaving. During these departures, UPN was purchased by CBS. Fans were resigned to cancellation at the end of the third season, but were surprised when the series was renewed, which was due in part to a reduction in the fees Paramount was charging UPN on a per-episode basis. However Enterprise was moved to a slot on Friday evening, the same night on which The Original Series was broadcast during its own third season before it was cancelled. On February 3, 2005, it was announced that Enterprise had been cancelled. This news was passed to the cast and crew during the sixth day of production on \\"In a Mirror, Darkly\\". The end of the series marked the first time in 18 years that no new Star Trek episodes were scheduled for broadcast, and Enterprise was the first live-action series of the franchise since The Original Series to last less than seven years. Braga said at a talk to students in Los Angeles shortly after the news of the cancellation was released that \\"After 18 straight years on the air and 750-some episodes the current run of Star Trek is over. Which is a good thing. It needs a rest\\". He added that he was not sure how long Star Trek would be off the air, but called it a \\"gestation\\" instead of a \\"cancellation\\". Russell T Davies, showrunner of the then-upcoming revived series of Doctor Who, was in talks about producing a crossover episode in which the Ninth Doctor lands the TARDIS on board the NX-01, but these plans were abandoned with the cancellation of Enterprise. The cancellation resulted in protests by fans, both at Paramount Studios and around the world as well as online. A website entitled TrekUnited.com was set up to raise funds for a fifth season, but failed to do so with the money refunded after the unsuccessful campaign. A total of $32 million had been raised. Several years later, the possibility of a fifth season was still being discussed with Braga suggesting that fans could prompt Netflix into producing a new season of Enterprise by watching the existing four seasons on the service. This resulted in a Facebook campaign set up to promote the idea of a fifth season. *Wolf Lake originally aired on CBS from September 19 to October 24, 2001. Nine episodes were produced, but only five aired before the series was canceled by CBS. The full series, including the four unaired episodes, was later picked up and broadcast on UPN in April‚ÄìMay 2002. *Under One Roof is a 2002 reality show on the UPN network. Hosted by Rob Nelson, the show's premise was to pit five families against each other to win a Fijian beachfront house. UPN has been criticized for having canceled the show, not once, but twice. After the first two episodes ‚Äì aired in March and April ‚Äì fared poorly in the ratings, the show was cancelled. It was brought back again in July as a summer replacement, repeating the first two episodes and airing the third, only to be cancelled again. The final four episodes never aired. ===2003=== *Half & Half is an American sitcom that aired from September 23, 2002, to May 15, 2006. T It was the second-most-watched show on UPN's Monday night line-up (next to Girlfriends) and fourth overall on the network. The show was on The CW's first draft line-up in March 2006, but due to several circumstances‚Äîincluding The CW's contractual obligation to pick up Reba, the uncancelling of All of Us, and the pick-up of the Girlfriends spin-off The Game‚ÄîHalf & Half was left off the final Fall 2006 schedule and ended production. *Haunted first aired on September 24, 2002 on UPN. The program, which was filmed in Vancouver,\\"2002 Wrap List\\". Reel West. Archived from the original on March 22, 2011. Retrieved November 9, 2010. was canceled on November 5, 2002 due to low ratings. As a result, only seven of the completed episodes were aired on UPN. However, all eleven filmed episodes have been shown in later airings of the show. *Abby aired for one season on UPN from January 6, 2003, to March 4, 2003. In 2002, United Paramount Network (UPN) announced that Sydney Tamiia Poitier and Sean O'Bryan would play the lead characters. Abby was Poitier's first starring role in a television series, and her sitcom debut. Describing the show's main concept as \\"fertile ground for a lot of humor\\", Poitier was also drawn to its multicultural casting. Producers initially imagined Will as a white character; Katlin said: \\"We had wanted to have an interracial relationship, but not make the show about an interracial relationship.\\" Producers gave the role to Kadeem Hardison instead of O'Bryan due to a negative response from test audiences. Criticizing the pilot episode for not explicitly addressing Will and Abby's interracial relationship, the previewers frequently asked: \\"Why aren't you dealing with it?\\" Addressing the change in casting, Poitier clarified that the series would preserve a \\"spirit of multiculturalism\\" through Will and Abby's dating life. She referred to Abby as one of the few television shows to represent interracial couples. As part of a discussion on UPN's 2002‚Äì2003 television season, The Baltimore Sun's Greg Braxton cited Abby as an example of the network adding more white actors to its programming; Braxton pointed to the show's focus on a biracial woman and her dates with white men. CBS television executive Leslie Moonves explained that UPN wanted to attract a wider audience. Critics classified Abby as a sex comedy and romantic comedy. Despite UPN's heavy promotion, it attracted a weekly average of just 1.7 million viewers, making it the lowest-performing show tracked by Nielsen Holdings. Critical responses were primarily negative; commentators praised Poitier's acting but criticized the show's reliance on sexual humor. Initially broadcast on Monday nights at 9:30pmEST in January 2003,Abby was a mid-season replacement after the paranormal drama Haunted was canceled. Between January and March, UPN moved the series to Tuesday nights at 9:00pmEST, along with the supernatural drama Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the sitcom Girlfriends. The first non-genre show placed in the time slot in two years, Abby aired against established programs Frasier, 24, The Guardian, and Smallville during a \\"competitive\\" time. UPN promoted the series as part of \\"an aggressive rollout strategy\\", targeting a primarily African-American audience. The Deseret News' Scott D. Pierce wrote that the network was \\"pinning its hopes on the new sitcom\\" along with the drama Platinum. UPN branded its Tuesday programming as a \\"comedy night\\" and \\"Girls Night\\", though Poitier was uncertain of the audience's possible response to the mixture of sitcoms and dramas. She explained that the network wanted Abby to attract the same audience as its Monday comedies. Commercially unsuccessful, Abby ranked last on the list of 146 shows tracked by the Nielsen Holdings; it attracted an average of 1.7 million viewers per week. Canceled after a nine-episode season, the series had its final episode air on March 4, 2003. From July 2003 to August 2003, reruns aired on Tuesday nights at 8:30pmEST. Overall, Abby was broadcast for a total of 270 minutes. *The Twilight Zone is the second of three revivals of Rod Serling's original 1959‚Äì64 television series. It aired for one season on the UPN network, with actor Forest Whitaker assuming Serling's role as narrator and on-screen host. It premiered on September 18, 2002, and aired its final episode on May 21, 2003. Broadcast in an hour format with two half-hour stories, it was canceled after one season. *Platinum aired from April 14 to May 13, 2003. Written by John Ridley and Sofia Coppola, the series is a family saga that follows two brothers who own and operate a record company. *America's Next Top Model premiered in May 2003, and aired semiannually until 2012, then annually from 2013. The first six seasons (referred to as \\"cycles\\") aired on UPN, before UPN merged with The WB to create The CW in 2006. It was announced on January 24, 2006, that Top Model would be part of the new The CW network, a merge between UPN and The WB, when the seventh cycle started in September airing on Wednesdays. The series became the first series among regular programming to air on the network. Prior to the announcement of merging with The WB, UPN had committed to renewing the series through its ninth cycle on January 20, 2006, for which casting was conducted throughout mid-2006. America's Next Top Model was the only show left on the network that was originally from UPN. ===2004=== *Eve originally aired for three seasons from September 15, 2003 to May 11, 2006. Featuring an ensemble cast consisting of Eve, Jason George, Ali Landry, Natalie Desselle-Reid, Brian Hooks, and Sean Maguire, the show revolves around two sets of male and female friends attempting to navigate relationships with the opposite sex. The series was developed as a vehicle for Eve under the working title The Opposite Sex; UPN executives approached the rapper about a television project after the success of fellow musician Brandy in another of the network's sitcoms, Moesha. Eve's series was created as part of the network's attempt to appeal to a younger demographic. After being picked up, the show was renamed Eve to attract the rapper's fans. UPN had promoted Eve as part of its new comedy block, one of four new comedies developed by the network. Eve suffered low viewership in spite of its high ratings among young African-American women; it was canceled following UPN's merger with The WB Television Network (The WB) to launch The CW in 2006. The series' cancellation, along with that of other black sitcoms, was criticized by media outlets for reducing representation of African- American characters and the number of roles for African-American actors on television. Critical response to Eve was mixed; some praised its inclusion as a part of UPN's line-up of black sitcoms, but others felt Eve lacked charisma, and that the series was inferior to its contemporaries. Despite the negative reception, the show and its star received several award nominations The show, as well as a majority of UPN's programs, was officially canceled when the network merged with The WB Television Network (The WB) to form The CW in 2006. Fern Gillespie of The Crisis was critical of UPN's decision to cancel the series given how the network, \\"in one swoop, wiped out five of its eight African-American comedies\\" with the creation of The CW. Gillespie expressed disappointment at the lack of African American sitcoms on the three major networks, saying: \\"Without that opportunity for some of the younger artists to hone and develop their skills, it will potentially have a generational impact.\\" IndieWire's Dara T. Mathis identified Eve as an example of UPN's notable black sitcoms, and equated the cancellations of a majority of UPN's comedies as a sign that the genre was in a state of decline. Critic Tim Goodman noted that Eve was one of six shows \\"geared for an African-American audience,\\" featuring \\"an African-American lead actress,\\" that were canceled during the merger. He viewed these cancellations as a sign of networks \\"eliminat[ing] niche programming\\". Julian Kimble of Complex included Eve on a list of programs that \\"are often forgotten about,\\" alongside other UPN sitcoms Half & Half and All of Us. *All of Us premiered on September 16, 2003, where it aired for its first three seasons. On October 1, 2006, the show moved to The CW, a new network formed by the merger of UPN and The WB (whose sister company Warner Bros. Television produced this series), where it aired for one more season before being cancelled on May 14, 2007. All of Us debuted on UPN on September 16, 2003. The series aired on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. EST for its first season. The show's second season aired on Tuesday nights at 8pm and was paired up with fellow UPN sitcom Eve. For its third season, UPN moved the series to Mondays at 8:30 p.m. EST airing after One on One. After three seasons of average ratings, and with the fall 2006 launch of The CW necessitating the cancellations of many of UPN and The WB's lower-rated programs, All of Us was originally slated to be cancelled after the 2005-2006 television season. However, the series was saved at the last minute and placed on The CW's fall 2006 lineup, airing on Sundays at 7:30 p.m. EST after Everybody Hates Chris. Due to lackluster ratings, the show moved back to its former Monday night time slot in the beginning of October 2006. During its single season on The CW, All of Us averaged around 2.74 million viewers per week. All of Us finished the season at #140 in the ratings, surpassing only The Game, America's Next Top Model (encore presentations), and the now cancelled Runaway. On May 15, 2007, The CW canceled All of Us. The CW was transitioning to shows that showcased more teenage and young adult dramas as well as Reality, (since ANTM was the highest rated show on the entire network) and steering away from sitcoms altogether. While the last season of All of Us averaged about the same viewers as the third season of The Vampire Diaries or the last four seasons of Smallville, it, like every other sitcom, be it an original UPN or WB show, was cancelled, as apparent by the CW not acquiring many sitcoms after the merger and slowly cancelling all sitcoms and not funding any after 2009. *The pilot episode of Rock Me Baby debuted on Monday September 15, 2003. The second episode 'Coupling' aired on September 23, 2003 and the following episodes followed exactly one week later. The last episode for the first series was 'Singing for your Supper' which aired on May 25, 2004. After the first season, UPN decided to cancel production of Rock Me Baby. *The Mullets first aired in September 2003, and was cancelled in March 2004 due to poor reception. Eleven episodes were made, but only eight were broadcast. *Game Over is adult computer-animated sitcom created by David Sacks (who would later become president of Nickelodeon Animation Studio), produced by Carsey-Werner Productions, and broadcast on UPN in 2004. It was cancelled after five episodes. Game Over was heavily hyped by UPN before its debut. The show generally received positive press upon its airing.TELEVISION REVIEW; Video Game Heroes: Just Folks, The New York Times, March 10, 2004. Despite this, only six episodes were made, which aired on a variety of different days - the fourth and fifth episodes were broadcast on April 2, 2004, and the sixth episode (\\"Monkey Dearest\\") was not aired. *R U the Girl aired in 2005. The series featured Tionne \\"T-Boz\\" Watkins and Rozonda \\"Chilli\\" Thomas, the remaining members of the all-girl R&B; group TLC whose former member, Lisa \\"Left Eye\\" Lopes, died in a car crash in Honduras on April 25, 2002. Initially promoted as a contest to permanently replace Lopes 3 years after her death by TLC themselves, both Watkins and Thomas admitted that the winner of the contest would not be joining TLC full-time and would not be a full-time replacement member; the winner would only provide guest vocals on a new single by the duo. The program aired nine episodes, with seven episodes being the main episodes, the eighth episode being an overview of the series and original TLC home videos, and the ninth being the series finale. The episodes' names are also puns based on TLC's songs. The finale episode was aired live and featured the final two contestants O'so Krispie and Mirrah Fay-Parker. Krispie (Tiffany Baker), a 20-year-old choreographer from Atlanta, was ultimately chosen as the winner and performed the single \\"I Bet\\" with Watkins and Thomas on the series finale. *Amish in the City premiered on July 28, 2004. The plot revolved around five Amish teenagers experiencing \\"modern\\" (non-Amish) culture by living in a house with six mainstream American teenagers. The concept was initially denounced by some for appearing to capitalize upon popular stereotypes about the Amish; later critical reviews were more positive. *The Player is a 2004 American reality television program in which several men compete with each other using their \\"player skills\\" to seduce an attractive woman. ===2005=== *Cuts aired from February 14, 2005, to May 11, 2006, and is a spin-off of another UPN series, One on One. The series is set up in the 21st and 22nd episodes of the third season of One on One titled ‚ÄúThe Prodigal Brother‚Äù and ‚ÄúSplitting Hairs‚Äù. The show was canceled along with many other shows when the UPN and WB networks merged to form The CW. *Second Time Around aired during the 2004‚Äì05 season. The series was canceled after one season. *Veronica Mars premiered on September 22, 2004, during television network UPN's final two years, and ended on May 22, 2007, after a season on UPN's successor, The CW, airing for three seasons total. Filming began in March 2004, and the series premiered in September to 2.49 million American viewers. The critically acclaimed first season's run of 22 episodes garnered an average of 2.5 million viewers per episode in the United States. In July and August 2005, four episodes of the first season aired on CBS, UPN's sibling network, in an attempt to gain more exposure for the series. Although not a ratings success, the series was a critical success from its first season. Robert Abele of LA Weekly said \\"in this smart, engaging series about a former popular girl turned crime-solving high school outcast, the hard-boiled dialogue comes from its teen protagonist's mouth in a way that stabs any potential cutesiness in the heart with an ice pick.\\" In her review, Paige Wiser of the Chicago Sun Times said that \\"on Veronica Mars, wholesome is out; gritty reality is in. The show never soft-pedals the timeless, fundamental truth that high school is hell.\\" Joyce Millman of The Phoenix felt that the series was \\"a character study masquerading as a high-school drama\\". Joy Press of The Village Voice saw the series as \\"a sharp teen noir in the making. Tinged with class resentment and nostalgia for Veronica's lost innocence, this series pulses with promise.\\" Michael Abernethy of PopMatters said that \\"intrigue, drama, and humor, Veronica Mars is also a lesson book for the disenfranchised. Few TV series aim so high; even fewer succeed so well.\\" James Poniewozik of Time labeled it as one of the six best dramas on television. He praised Bell as \\"a captivating star\\", and said that the series \\"uses its pulp premise to dramatize a universal teen experience: that growing up means sleuthing out the mystery of who you really are.\\" Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called the series an update to the \\"classic California film noir\\". She felt that Veronica Mars was the best new series on UPN, and that the title character was potentially \\"this season's most interesting character creation\\". McFadden described the series as \\"Alias in its attitude, Raymond Chandler in its writing and The O.C. in its class-consciousness.\\" Stephanie Zacharek of Salon praised the first-season finale for being \\"just the sort of satisfying capper you look for in a series that, week after week, keeps you asking questions.\\" *Britney and Kevin: Chaotic is an American reality television series created and directed by Anthony E. Zuiker. Starring American recording artist Britney Spears and her then-husband Kevin Federline, the five-episode series aired on UPN from May 17 to June 14, 2005. The series chronicles the couple's relationship from their courtship, engagement and wedding. After a \\"fierce bidding war\\", on April 5, 2005, it was announced that Spears had signed a deal with UPN to air a reality television series documenting her relationship with Federline. The series, which would air in five episodes, was revealed to chronicle the relationship \\"from the earliest stages of their courtship to their engagement and ultimately, their stroll down the aisle\\". In a statement about the series, Spears stated: \\"From the day that Kevin and I met, there have been constant rumors and inaccurate speculation about our lives together. I feel that last year, the tabloids ran my life, and I am really excited about showing my fans what really happened, rather than all the stories, which have been misconstrued by journalists in the past. As I mentioned before, I am now going to be expressing my personal life through art\\". The first episode of the series was seen by 3.7 million viewers, making it UPN's most-watched piece of regularly scheduled programming in the 9pm Tuesday timeslot since March 2004. The second episode garnered 3 million viewers, finishing in eighty-first in its timeslot for the week. The third and fourth episode were viewed by 2.5 million viewers each, while the final, aired an hour earlier at 8:00pm Eastern Standard Time, drew 2.1 million viewers. In one month, Britney and Kevin: Chaotic lost 1.6 million viewers. *The Bad Girl's Guide aired from May 24 to July 5, 2005. The TV show was based on the best-selling Bad Girls Guides by Cameron Tuttle, who was the show's co-creator and co-executive producer. *The Road to Stardom with Missy Elliott was a competitive reality television show that aired in 2005. The main judge and host was hip-hop artist Missy Elliott. Other judges were singer-producer Teena Marie, producer Dallas Austin, and manager Mona Scott. The show was not picked up for a second season. *Kevin Hill aired from September 29, 2004 to May 18, 2005, during the 2004‚Äì2005 TV season. ===2006=== This would be the final season of broadcasting for both UPN and The WB. They would merge to form The CW next season. UPN quietly ceased operations on Friday, September 15, 2006, with its usual airing of WWE Friday Night SmackDown; in addition, some stations aired the network's usual, but optional, weekend repeat block. The low-key closure was not surprising given that in nine media markets, including the three largest, UPN was not available because the local affiliates were owned by Fox Television Stations and switched to its new network, MyNetworkTV, on September 5. UPN programs stopped airing on WPWR (channel 50) in Chicago and KUTP (channel 45) in Phoenix on September 1, and on the other seven Fox-owned stations (including WWOR-TV (channel 9) in New York City and KCOP (channel 13) in Los Angeles) the day before, August 31. Several CW affiliates began airing Smackdown and some other CW-renewed UPN programming a few weeks early to replace UPN affiliates that had switched to MyNetworkTV. Otherwise, it was unclear whether MyNetworkTV affiliates would air UPN or WB programs at all. Additionally, Tribune-owned Fox affiliate WXMI (channel 17) in Grand Rapids, Michigan aired Smackdown on tape delay between WXSP-CA (channel 15)'s switch to MyNetworkTV and the launch of WWMT (channel 3)'s digital subchannel as the local CW affiliate. *Sex, Love & Secrets originally aired from September 27, 2005, to October 18, 2005. Sex, Love & Secrets was broadcast initially on Tuesday nights at 9 pm EST on United Paramount Network (UPN). The episodes aired between September 27, 2005, and October 18, 2005. It was one of three new shows the network ordered for the 2005‚Äì06 United States network television schedule. The show's official website hosted preview videos and an interactive map of the Silver Lake community. Muir wrote that UPN intended to market the series to fans of Beverly Hills, 90210 and Melrose Place. Melanie McFarland considered Sex, Love & Secrets part of the network's plans to add more prime-time soap operas to its scheduling. The show was a TV14 rating for suggestive dialogue, sexual situations, and coarse or crude language. The pilot received \\"mixed reviews and weak viewership\\", having been watched by an average of 1.4 million people. Due to its poor reception and ratings, UPN canceled Sex, Love & Secrets after one episode aired. It had the lowest rating of any network television show that aired in the 2005‚Äì06 season. The network clarified that it would broadcast the remaining episodes that had been filmed, and might renew the show if ratings improved. UPN did not air six of the eight episodes. Sex, Love & rated 155th out of 156 shows in the 2005‚Äì06 television schedule‚Äîabove only Get This Party Started. According to Muir, it fared poorly in every demographic. In 2008, Universal HD played the unaired episodes of Sex, Love & Secrets as part of its \\"Sexy Summer Sundays\\" along with episodes of South Beach. *Get This Party Started is a reality television series hosted by Ethan Erickson and Kristin Cavallari in early February 2006. The program was scheduled in the lowest- rated time slot of the 2005-06 television season in UPN's 9:00pm ‚Äì 10:00pm Tuesday slot, where Sex, Love & Secrets had failed before. Get This Party Started garnered low ratings and was canceled by the network after only two episodes. The show ended up rated 156th, last out of the 156 programs which aired on the six major American broadcast networks in the 2005‚Äì06 season. *South Beach ran from January 11 to February 22, 2006. It was canceled after eight first-run episodes. Similar to UPN's Fall 2005 effort Sex, Love & Secrets, South Beach was not welcomed by critics. The Miami Herald said that, \\"Cannibalism is about the only thing missing from this delirious new trashfest of hard bodies and soft brains.\\" The Washington Posts headline for the show was \\"Bang, Bang, Bling, Bling, Blah, Blah.\\" The writer called the show \\"vacuous... preposterous and pretentious.\\" The Seattle Times said, \\"The dialogue's awful, ranging from clich√©s (\\"I don't want to work in my uncle's restaurant the rest of my life\\") to quotations (\\"First you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the women\\") to product placements (\\"Anybody got a Red Bull?\\"). The show was one of the lowest-rated on television. It ranked 152nd out of the 156 original series produced for network television in the 2005‚Äì2006 season. South Beach was canceled when it was announced that the new The WB/UPN hybrid network, The CW, would not renew the show for additional seasons. *Everybody Hates Chris originally aired on UPN for its first season in 2005, but later moved to The CW, where it aired its remaining three seasons. *Love, Inc. originally aired for one season from September 22, 2005 to May 11, 2006. The series was originally designed as a star vehicle for Shannen Doherty, who portrayed Denise Johnson in the unaired pilot. Denise was Doherty's first role in a television sitcom. Doherty said that she loved the script for the pilot immediately, describing it as \\"hysterical\\", but felt intimidated by the role given her inexperience with comedy. The series was marketed initially as featuring Doherty and Peete, before UPN announced that it would pick up the show on the condition that Doherty was removed and the character was recast. According to TV Guide, Doherty was poorly received by preview audiences. When asked about Doherty's removal from the show, executive producer Warren Littlefield said the actress was \\"fabulous\\" in the role. He believed Doherty wanted to change her negative reputation from leaving Beverly Hills, 90210 and Charmed by acting on the show. Peete praised her performance saying \\"we had so much fun and such a great vibe\\". UPN Entertainment's president cited the rationale behind Doherty's departure using the \\"standard going-in-a-different-direction reason\\". Rachel Cericola of TV Fodder listed Love, Inc. as one the \\"four promising sitcoms for the upcoming TV season\\" as a result of the behind the scenes drama involving Doherty's replacement. UPN announced that Busy Philipps was cast as Denise on July 25, and was later billed as the show's star. In her 2018 memoir, Phillips said she was initially reluctant the part due to UPN's treatment of Doherty, writing: \\"they had decided to replace her only after they had trotted her out at the up-fronts and used her for publicity, which I thought was a fairly shitty thing to do\\".Philipps (2018): p. 220 According to Vince Vieluf, the casting change from Doherty to Philipps led to the series being retooled as an ensemble show featuring all the members of the agency rather than focusing on Denise. Vieluf said the alterations in the series' premise were due to concerns that \\"people would get tired of a show that was only about the mishaps of one person's love life\\". The casting of racially diverse actors was identified with UPN's position as \\"the only network to actively program for an African American audience\\". Tim Good of the San Francisco Chronicle pointed to the show's casting as the only way in which it acts as a \\"positive reference\\". On August 6, 2005, UPN officially ordered thirteen episodes of the series. The network later ordered a full season of twenty-two episodes of the show on November 7, 2005, amid speculation that it would be canceled. UPN paired the series with Everybody Hates Chris, Eve, and Cuts to attract an \\"urban\\" audience. The network moved WWE SmackDown to Fridays in favor of scheduling Thursdays as focused on sitcoms. This decision was made to establish a \\"night of scripted programming\\" and to attract more advertising from film studios to promote upcoming releases. Today questioned the network's belief that Love, Inc. and Everybody Hates Chris would appeal to the same viewership, and noted the difference in quality between the two, with Love, Inc. cited as the inferior show. While the series retained 59% of the audience from Everybody Hates Chris initially, this marketing strategy proved unsuccessful when it lost a majority of the viewership in later episodes. Cericola reported that Love, Inc. earned an average of 3.6 million viewers per episode and an article in The Hollywood Reporter stated that the series garnered an average of 1.0/3 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. It ranked 141st among broadcast television networks in the 2005‚Äì2006 television season. According to the Nielsen Company, the show achieved high ratings among \\"Latina adolescents Ages 12‚Äì17\\" and earned 3.4 million viewers in that demographic in 2005. It ranked above two other UPN sitcoms: One on One and Half & Half for Latin women in the 12‚Äì17 age demographic,Servaes (2013): p. 347 and in \\"the top half of all UPN series\\" for total viewership. The series premiere saw a 6% increase in the 18‚Äì49 age range, 53% in women between 18 and 34, and 118% in women between 18 and 49 from the show that aired in the same time period during the previous television season. The show, as well as a majority of UPN's programs, were officially canceled as a result of the network's merger with the WB Television Network (the WB) to form the CW in 2006.McCann (2009): p. 291 Fern Gillespie of The Crisis was critical of UPN's decision to cancel the series given how the network \\"in one swoop, wiped out five of its eight African American comedies\\" for the creation of the CW. Gillespie expressed disappointment at the lack of African American sitcoms on the three major networks saying: \\"Without that opportunity for some of the younger artists to hone and develop their skills, it will potentially have a generational impact.\\" Critic Tim Goodman identified Love, Inc. as one of six shows \\"geared for an African American audience\\" and featuring \\"an African American lead actress\\" that were canceled during the merger. He equated these cancellations as a sign of networks \\"eliminat[ing] niche programming\\".Warner (2015): p. 98 ==See also== *List of programs broadcast by UPN *List of former UPN affiliates *UPN Kids **Disney's One Too *History of The WB ==References== ==External links== *Was The UPN Network Underrated Or Ahead Of Its Time? *25 Years Later: Why UPN Is Black America‚Äôs Unforgotten And Forever Beloved Television Network *Book gives an insider's view of what happened at WB, UPN *The Top 30 Shows in WB and UPN history: 24-16 *Was UPN Black America‚Äôs Last Hope for a Black Sitcom-Friendly Broadcast Television Network? * Why the WB and UPN Were Two Television Networks Ahead of Their Time *UPN: The Rise of the 5th TV Network (pt. 1) - YouTube **What Happened to UPN?!

It was released as the lead single off of her debut studio album, Sawayama on 22 November 2019 for digital download and streaming. It is a nu metal, heavy metal, hard rock, pop and avant-pop track which criticizes microaggressions against Asian people. It received positive reviews from music critics, who praised its aggressive tone and the shift in genre and direction. The song received a music video. == Background == According to Sawayama, the track was inspired by \\"early 2000s pop-rock and nu-metal; [...] No Doubt, Limp Bizkit, t.A.T.u. and Evanescence\\". She also added that she \\"was really itching to do something that was inspired by like N.E.R.D. or Evanescence or like t.A.T.u., or some of the heavier Britney [Spears] stuff\\" and that her goal with the track was to \\"shock people because [she]'d been away for a while\\" == Composition and lyrical themes == \\"STFU!\\" was noted by critics as a departure from the 2000s-inspired pop and R&B; sound of Sawayama's previous works.

This edition is the first complete Bible printed entirely in Greek (first edition of the whole Bible in Greek; the text contained in the Complutensian Polyglot, though dated 1514-17, was not published before 1520). The text of this edition is based on the Complutensian text for the Old Testament, and upon the first edition of the New Testament by Erasmus for the New Testament. It was edited by , the father-in-law of Aldus (Pt. I. edited by Andreas Asolanus, pt. II. by , and pt. III., the New Testament, also by Franciscus Asolanus). The full title of the Aldine Bible is: Œ†Œ¨ŒΩœÑŒ± œÑ·Ω∞ Œ∫Œ±œÑ·æø ·ºêŒæŒøœá·Ω¥ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒøœçŒºŒµŒΩŒ± Œ≤ŒπŒ≤ŒªŒØŒ±, Œ∏ŒµŒØŒ±œÇ Œ¥Œ∑ŒªŒ±Œ¥·Ω¥ Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜ·øÜœÇ œÄŒ±ŒªŒ±Œπ·æ∂œÇ œÑŒµ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ŒΩŒ≠Œ±œÇ.

He is bay in color with no markings on his legs or face. However, he does regularly have two white bandages on his hind legs during race day. He is a son of Blueformer (USA) who was by Dynaformer (USA), a sire of multiple classic winners including 2006 Kentucky Derby Barbaro as well as Manhattan Handicap winner Point of Entry, and North American champion steeplechaser McDynomo. Her mother Lump of Joy (USA) comes from Lombardi (USA), which was exported to England for competition. She also produced Dominican champion sprinter Compulsivo == Racing career == === 2-year-old season === Sic√≥tico made its debut on April 24, 2007, in the third race at a distance of 1,000 meters. Sic√≥tico, was a super-heavy favorite at odds of 1/9, however, in the race, Sic√≥tico failed to even complete the race as he unseated his rider in the race. His first career victory would happen on July 21, 2007, in a maiden race at a distance of 1,000 meters setting a time of 1:00 2/5. Quickly after this victory, Sic√≥tico would begin to show off his pure dominance at stakes level taking the Copa Simon A. Pemberton and then taking the La Copa El Incorruptible at 1,400 meters. This showed that Sic√≥tico was going to be a colt that the more distance they gave him, the more he ran. He would continue racking up wins at the age of 2 managing 7 by the end of the year from distances of 1,000‚Äì1,700 meters. His seventh and final win of the year was by far one of the most visually impressive despite there being 4 other challengers 3 of them barely made it to the final turn by the time he hit the finish line shattering the track record with a time of 1:22 1/5. === 3-year-old season === If his performances at the age of 2 were anything to go on, Sic√≥tico was going to be a monster. He made his seasonal debut La Copa D√≠a de Duarte where he set another track record running the race in 1:44 3/5. He would go on to win 2 more races to extend his winning streak to 10 straight races in preparation for the first jewel of the Dominican Republican Triple Crown the Cl√°sico Mat√≠as Ram√≥n Mella. It was no challenge at all as the triple crown turned out to be nothing but a cakewalk winning the races by huge margins and not letting anyone get near him. Following his win in the triple crown, he would manage 2 more wins increasing his win streak to 16 straight before going to the biggest test of his career the Cl√°sico del Caribe. In over 42 runnings of the race and even hosting the race in 1995 the Dominican Republic had never actually won the race. But now was the best shot they had ever had. Sic√≥tico did not take the lead, as jockey Joel Rosario positioned him fifth passing the post of the final 900 meters and wasn't fazed when Defensora and Venezuelan Rey Angelo passed inside. Sic√≥tico entered third behind Defensora and the Mexican Antares. Defensora began to fade in the final meters and Sic√≥tico took advantage of this and zoomed on by winning the race by 1 length. He had completed the course in 1:52.54 for the 1,800 meters. The Dominican Republic had gotten there first ever Cl√°sico del Caribe there was no doubt about it now Sic√≥tico was the best 3-year-old in the Caribbean. === 4-year-old season === He would return to the Dominican Republic where he would continue to show off his near invincibility by setting a track record for 6 furlongs with a 1:09 1/5. He then went on to get repeat wins in the Cl√°sico Restauraci√≥n and the Cl√°sico Presidente Constitucional. He then set a second track record that year at 1 3‚ÅÑ16 miles with a 1:56 1/5. By the end of his campaign in the Dominican Republic, he had stretched his winning streak to 24 straight victories. Which to this day is the 6th greatest winning streak in the history of horse racing and the second greatest winning streak of the 21st century only beaten by Winx. He would make his final career start in the Copa Confraternidad del Caribe a race the Dominican Republic had only won once in 1995. Arrangements were made for Joel Rosario to ride Sic√≥tico again but commitments that were presented to him could not be specified. The decision was made for the Puerto Rican rider Jes√∫s Manuel R√≠os to be his rider in the 10 furlongs race. Sic√≥tico would play the role of stalker staying in third turning for the home stretch he could only get a slim lead as Soy Conquistador outfought him in the stretch and opened up a lead while Sic√≥tico simply didn't have anything left fading to fifth for what would be his final start. == Retirement == After the Copa Confraternidad del Caribe Sic√≥tico would be retired with 26 starts, 24 of them were victories, all of them consecutively, only ever losing his first and final races. He set multiple track records ranging from 6 furlongs all the way to 1 3‚ÅÑ16 miles. He became the richest horse to ever race in the Dominican Republic earning $223,825. As well as the only horse from the Dominican Republic to win the Cl√°sico del Caribe and is considered by many to be the greatest horse to ever race in the Dominican Republic. In retirement, he has managed to sire many classic winners including San Elias, Panelista, and Amoroso. == References == Category:2005 racehorse births Category:Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing winners ","title":"Sic√≥tico"},{"id":"63894709","text":"Reimund was a long serving Archdeacon of Leicester; he was first mentioned in 1198 and lastly in 1225.University of Leicester ==Notes== ==Also see== * Diocese of Lincoln * Diocese of Peterborough * Diocese of Leicester * Archdeacon of Leicester Category:Archdeacons of Leicester Category:12th- century English clergy Category:13th-century English clergy ","title":"Reimund"},{"id":"63894716","text":"Borhan Uddin Ahmed is a Bangladesh Awami League politician and the former Member of Parliament of Jessore-2. ==Career== Ahmed was elected to parliament from Jessore-2 as a Bangladesh Awami League candidate in 1973.

This river flows in the Regional County Municipality (RCM) of: *Les Jardins-de-Napierville Regional County Municipality: in the municipalities of Saint-Patrice-de- Sherrington and Saint-√âdouard; *Roussillon Regional County Municipality: in the municipalities of Saint-Mathieu, Delson and Candiac. The river surface is generally frozen from mid-December to the end of March. Safe traffic on the ice is generally from late December to early March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation. == Geography == The main hydrographic slopes neighboring the rivi√®re de la Tortue are: * north side: St. Lawrence Seaway, St. Lawrence River; * east side: Saint-Andr√© stream, Saint Jacques River (Roussillon); * south side: Laffite stream, Acadia River; * west side: Saint-Pierre River (Saint-R√©gis River tributary); The rivi√®re de la Tortue originates from a set of agricultural streams draining the area 3.8 km southwest of the village of Saint-Patrice-de-Sherrington, north of Laffite stream, north -west of the side of Acadia River and north of the hamlet of Barrington. From Saint-Patrice-de-Sherrington, the rivi√®re de la Tortue flows north into agricultural land. In its northward course, the Tortue River passes west of the village of Saint-Patrice-de-Sherrington, recovering the water from the agricultural streams Lazure, Saint-Michel and Provost. The river flows through the heart of the village of Saint-√âdouard, then collects the waters of the Boulerice-Yelle stream along (on the west side) autoroute 15 over a 7.3 km segment. Then the river turns west and goes to the village of Saint-Mathieu where it collects the Faille stream on its left bank near the community center. From the village of Saint-Mathieu, the river flows straight north along (east side) the railway and passing west of the hamlet Val- Wooded. At the height of the industrial zone, the river begins to meander; what she will do until the end of her journey. From the industrial zone, the river continues its course to the north, collecting the water from the Isabelle and Lasaline streams, passes under the autoroute 30 very close (east side) of the road of iron. Then the river enters from the south into the town of Delson where it winds north. The river continues its course passing in Candiac until its mouth. The mouth of the rivi√®re de la Tortue is located on the south shore of the St. Lawrence Seaway, downstream of the C√¥te-Sainte-Catherine lock, 3 km downstream of the mouth of the Saint-Pierre River (Saint-R√©gis River tributary). The rivi√®re de la Tortue flows more or less in parallel (on the east side) to the Saint-Pierre River (Saint-R√©gis River tributary). It flows for 24 km between the source and the village of Saint-Mathieu; then 12.6 km to its mouth. Because of its low slope, the Tortoise river is favorable to get out of its bed during flooding. == Toponymy == The toponym \\"Rivi√®re de la Tortue\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec.

It was instituted by law in 1950 and lasted in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia until 1989, just prior to its breakup in 1991. The main goal was to move the managing of companies into the hands of workers and to separate the management from the state and it was further solidified by law in the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution. It was also meant to demonstrate the viability of a third way between the capitalist United States and the communist Soviet Union. ==History== As President of Yugoslavia, Josip Broz Tito prided himself on Yugoslavia's independence from the Soviet Union, with Yugoslavia never accepting full membership in Comecon and Tito's open rejection of many aspects of Stalinism as the most obvious manifestations of this. The Soviets and their satellite states often accused Yugoslavia of Trotskyism and social democracy, charges loosely based on Tito's form of workers' self-management and the theory of associated labor (profit sharing policies and worker-owned industries initiated by him, Milovan ƒêilas and Edvard Kardelj in 1950). It was in these things that the Soviet leadership accused of harboring the seeds of council communism or even corporatism. In 1948, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia held its Fifth Congress. The meeting was held shortly after Stalin accused Tito of being a nationalist and moving to the right branding his heresy Titoism. This resulted in a break with the Soviet Union known as the Informbiro period. Initially the Yugoslav communists, despite the break with Stalin, remained as hard line as before but soon began to pursue a policy of independent socialism that experimented with the self-management of workers in state-run enterprises, with decentralization and other departures from the Soviet model of a Communist state. Under the influence of reformers such as Boris Kidriƒç and Milovan ƒêilas, Yugoslavia experimented with ideas of workers self-management where workers influenced the policies of the factories in which they worked and shared a portion of any surplus revenue. This resulted in a change in the party's role in society from holding a monopoly of power to being an ideological leader. As a result, the party name and the names of the regional branches respectively were changed to the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (Savez komunista Jugoslavije, SKJ) in 1952 during its Sixth Congress. ==Criticism== The top-down nature of the workers' councils however led to corruption, cynicism and inefficiencies until they were abolished during the Yugoslav Wars. By 1989, Ante Markoviƒá's reform government abolished self-management. At this time, the country had crippling foreign debt, structural adjustment measures enforced by the International Monetary Fund, and economic collapse amplified the centrifugal pulls of foreign markets. ==References== Category:Anarchist theory Category:Communism Category:Cooperatives Category:Economic systems Self-management Category:Management by type Category:Market socialism Category:Marxian economics Category:Marxism Category:Political philosophy Category:Political theories Category:Recovered factories Category:Socialism Category:Syndicalism ","title":"Socialist self-management"},{"id":"63894893","text":"Gladys Thomas (born 1934) is a South African poet and playwright.

Despite the title, the film does not feature any vampires but instead deals with a thousand-year old demon ghost. ==Plot== Cheung Sap-yat is an exorcist in Jiangxi, China who possesses a vase from the Ming dynasty which contains a demon spirit who was a renegade disciple of Cheung's ancestor. Cheung's son, Siu-bo, leads a group of Cultural Revolution supporters, to confiscate the vase from him so Cheung tosses the vase into the sea, which floats to Hong Kong and ends up in a charity auction. The vase ends up being auctioned to Councilor Stephen Kei and his son Jacky, who recently dropped out from school abroad, for HK$1.8 million. When Stephen and Jacky bring the vase home, Stephen's religious mother senses something dirty with the vase so Stephen's girlfriend, Mable, suggests him to bring the vase to visit fortune teller Chan Pak-tung, who is actually a fraud and Mable's secret lover who schemes with her to scam money from Stephen. Stephen brings the vase to Chan, who pretends to perform a Taoist ritual. Chan then dumps some cigar ashes into the vase which causes the demon's hand to pop out of it and when Chan tries to see what is wrong the vase, the demon's hand pushes him away and he gives the vase back to Stephen. Back at the Kei mansion, the vase suddenly starts smoking and the demon comes out of it and knocks Stephen unconscious. At this time, Jacky was playfully scaring his girlfriend, Cat (Elsie Chan), by wearing monster masks in the dark, and Jacky's younger sister Micky and his grandmother join along. The game is then interrupted when Jacky accidentally kicks his grandmother and they encounter the demon, who they believe is Stephen wearing a mask. The demon tries to attack them but is blocked by a shrine that shines on him, so he then possesses Stephen. During the time, Cheung has illegally entered Hong Kong after finding out the Keis bought the vase. Cheung is able to evade the police with his agility and later uses supernatural abilities to make a traffic cop hallucinate and give him a ride to the Kei mansion. As Cheung arrives the mansion, he realizes the demon had gotten out of the vase and attempts to exorcise the demon but the demon-possessed Stephen drives him away by shooting him with a sniper rifle. Meanwhile, Jacky accidentally runs over Cheung while on a night drive with Cat and brings Cheung to his mansion after the latter refuses to go to the hospital. While Jacky and Cat were bringing the doctor for Cheung, he is once again attacked by the demon-possessed Stephen. Cheung, who left his tools in Jacky's car, is nearly able to subdue the demon by using a bell from Micky's stuffed Garfield cat until Micky interrupts him and takes the cat and bell away from him and Cheung flees right before Jacky and Cat bring the doctor. The next day, Cheung finds Jacky and Cat in a church to warn them about Stephen being possessed by a demon but they dismiss him. One night, the demon-possessed Stephen meets with a fellow councilor, Lee, who notices Stephen's recent change in behavior and comments that Stephen may be going insane so the demon manipulates Lee to hallucinate his belt turning into snake and causing him to be run over and killed by a car. At night, a thunder causes the demon to temporary reveal his true form which was seen by Mable, who tells Chan while cheating with him in her house but Chan deduces that Stephen has a fetish in scaring her. The demon-possessed Stephen then arrives and Chan goes into hiding and is horrified after seeing the demon killing Mable. The demon-possessed Stephen then finds Chan and chases him outside and attempts to kill him until Cheung comes just in time strike the demon in the chest and stop him. As the demon-possessed Stephen returns home to treat his wound, Micky notices him so the demon leaves Stephen's body and possess Cat. Cheung and Chan then arrives at the Kei mansion and tell about what is happening but is unable to prove so since Stephen is not possessed anymore and were kicked out by the family. Cheung and Chan then realize that the demon had possessed Micky. The next morning, Cheung and Chan manage to kidnap the demon-possessed Micky, but the demon manages to cause the car they were in to crash and they end up hospitalized. At the hospital, the doctor tells Stephen and Jacky that Micky's brainwave is unusually strong. During the night, the demon-possessed Micky kills the nurse in charge of watching her and two police officers interrogating Cheung before attacking the latter and causing havoc in the hospital. Jacky, Stephen and Cat also arrive in the hospital and see what has happened to Micky. Afterwards, Cheung tells Jacky, Stephen, Cat and Chan the only way to exorcise the demon is to use a spiritual pole which he left in the crashed car and a Taoist mirror inside the vase. Since Cheung is under custody for illegally entering Hong Kong, he also tells them how to summon his spirit when they need help. Jacky and Cat find the pole in the car at the vehicle pound while Stephen and Chan return to the mansion to find the mirror in the vase, but the demon leaves Micky's body and possess Stephen once again and brings the vase to an abandoned part of the mansion where Stephen's deceased father used to live. Jacky, Cat and Chan follow him there and the demon-possessed Stephen attacks them. During the fight, they were able to summon Cheung to possess Cat, but Cheung was unable to unleash his full power in a female's body until he possess Jacky. During the battle, a doctor and nurse discover Cheung's body at hospital dead with no pulse and prepares to dissect it, so Cheung returns to his body to stop this from happening and leave Jacky, Cat and Chan to take on the demon. The trio were able to find the mirror inside the vase and manage to fend the demon off before Cheung arrives back and subdues the demon. Jacky, who is holding the pole, is reluctant to stab the demon since it will also kill his father who is possessed by the demon but eventually does so and the demon is finally exorcised, with Stephen seemingly destroyed as well. However, a tree falls from above where Stephen comes out safe and not possessed anymore. Micky then gives Stephen an expensive vase that was delivered to him yesterday, but he tosses it off after having gone through all the troubles, and Jacky and Cat jump to catch the priceless treasure from shattering. ==Cast== *Jacky Cheung as Jacky Kei (Á•ÅÂ§©‰Ωë) *Kent Cheng as Cheung Sap-yat (ÂºµÂçÅ‰∏Ä) *Stanley Fung as Stephen Kei (Á•ÅÂ§ßÂ∑ù) *Natalis Chan as Chan Pak-tung (Èô≥ÁôæÈÄö) *Elsie Chan as Cat *Anglie Leung as Mable *Che Man-kei as Micky Kei (Á•ÅÂ§©Áúü) *Manfred Wong as Cheung Siu-bo (ÂºµÂ∞èÂØ∂) *Austin Wai as Elder disciple of Cheung's ancestor *Chung Fat as Demon from the vase *Shum Wai as Horse bookie after Chan *Law Lan as Councilor Tang (ÈÑßË≠∞Âì°) *Wong Wai as Councilor Lee (ÊùéË≠∞Âì°) *Yip Kai as Shui (ÈòøÊ∞¥) *Benz Kong as Policeman interrogating Cheung *Leung Sam as Councilor *Law Shu-kei as Catholic priest *Tin Kai-man as Pedestrian watching TV *Barry Wong as Pedestrian watching TV *Chun Kwai-bo as Revolutionary *Patrick Ling as Revolutionary *John Cheung as Doctor *Leung Hak-shun as Auctioneer *Ma Shu-san as Auction bidder *Lee Wah-kon as Auction bidder ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== Hong Kong Film Net gave the film a score of 6/10 stars and describes it as a \\"semi-coherent ramblings of a borderline lunatic.\\" ===Box office=== The film grossed HK$6,080,335 at the Hong Kong box office during its theatrical run from 8 June to 12 September 1989. ==References== ==External links== * *Vampire Buster at Hong Kong Cinemagic * Category:Hong Kong films Category:1989 films Category:1989 martial arts films Category:1980s action comedy films Category:1980s comedy horror films Category:1980s supernatural horror films Category:1980s ghost films Category:Hong Kong action comedy films Category:Hong Kong martial arts comedy films Category:Hong Kong slapstick comedy films Category:Hong Kong supernatural horror films Category:Hong Kong ghost films Category:Martial arts horror films Category:Supernatural action films Category:Supernatural comedy films Category:Cantonese-language films Category:Films set in Hong Kong Category:Films shot in Hong Kong Category:1989 comedy films ","title":"Vampire Buster"},{"id":"63895019","text":"The 2018 Wayne State Warriors football team represented Wayne State University in the 2018 NCAA Division II football season.

They were the first legislative by-elections ever held in the Republic of Cyprus. One candidate was elected unopposed, with voting only needed for three seats. ==Background== Cyprus gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 16 August 1960. The 1960 constitution provided for a system where the Greek and Turkish communities of the island would share power. The 50-seat House of Representatives had 35 seats elected by the Greek Community and 15 by the Turkish Community. The first parliamentary elections were held on 7 August 1960. In the Greek Community's contest, two parties, the Patriotic Front, which supported the President Makarios III, and the communist Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL) formed a pact, with the Patriotic Front fielding 30 candidates and AKEL five. All of their candidates were elected. In the Turkish Community's contest, all elected representatives were members of the Cyprus Turkish National Union, which was led by the Vice-President of Cyprus Fazƒ±l K√º√ß√ºk. On 16 August 1960, four members of the House of Representatives were appointed ministers; Greek Cypriot Andreas Papadopoulos (Limassol) was appointed Minister of Communications and Works and Turkish Cypriots Osman √ñrek (Nicosia), Fazil Plumber (Nicosia) and Niyazi Manyera (Famagusta) were appointed Ministers of Defence, Agriculture and Health respectively. On 29 August 1960, the House of Representatives set 29 September as the date for the by-elections to fill the four vacant seats. ==Campaign== ===Greek Cypriots=== For the Greek Community's seat in Limassol, the Patriotic Front's candidate was Daphnis Panayides, an EOKA veteran and a farmer. AKEL did not contest the seat, as it believed that it belonged to the Patriotic Front. The Pancyprian Farmers' Union (PEK) had previously supported the Patriotic Front, and 12 of the Patriotic Front's MPs came from PEK. However, PEK supported Panagiotis Orphanos, a farmer, and held a \\"conference of farmers from Limassol\\" which \\"decided unanimously\\" to endorse Orphanou's candidacy. Achilleas Malliotis, a doctor from Limassol, also submitted his candidacy. In a statement dated 19 September PEK claimed that, after it had chosen Orphanos as its candidate, he proposed to Panayides to accept the candidacy of PEK instead, but Panayides refused. A few days later, according to PEK, Orphanos visited Panayides and Panayides reassured him he would not contest the seat, \\"despite pressure from the Patriotic Front.\\" Later in its statement PEK urged everybody in Limassol to, \\"Work with fanaticism for the victory of PEK.\\" Daphnis Panayides replied to PEK's statement on 21 September, stating that, after his return to Cyprus, members of PEK approached him to inform him of their \\"irrevocable\\" decision to support Panayiotis Orphanos, which they would do \\"regardless of whether the Patriotic Front would.\\" Panayides then stated he had responded he would support Orphanou's candidacy \\"only if it was endorsed by the Patriotic Front.\\" In a proclamation PEK implied it would end its support of the Patriotic Front, which it called, \\"The 'Patriotic Front'\\". A proposal was made to the two candidates after Achilleas Malliotis withdrew his candidacy. The proposal, made by Glafkos Clerides, Polycarpos Georkadjis and Spyros Kyprianou, provided that they withdraw from the elections and discuss their mutual support for a third candidate in the Presidential Palace. This was rejected by PEK. ===Turkish Cypriots=== In Famagusta the Cyprus Turkish National Union's candidate, Nebil Nabi Beyin, was elected unopposed.

Badin is wanted by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and the German federal prosecutor Generalbundesanwalt. He is suspected of being a member of the Sofacy Group. Badin was last known to be located in Moscow, Russia.{{factdate=M ==Biography== The FBI has been seeking Badin since 2018 by an international arrest warrant based on a suspicion that he is responsible for manipulating the 2016 US presidential election and attacking the servers of the international anti-doping agency WADA. The German federal prosecutor obtained an international arrest warrant against him in early May 2020. He is said to be responsible for a hacker attack on the Bundestag in 2015. At least 16 gigabytes of data were captured, including from one of the offices of Chancellor Angela Merkel. The Sofacy Group (\\"Fancy Bear\\"), of which Badin is believed to be a member, is responsible for this attack. The allegations against Badin are based on secret service activities and the spying on data. The international investigation platform Bellingcat confirmed Badin's birth dates and his work for unit 26165 of the GRU, which specializes in cryptography. His car was also registered at the Moscow address of GRU. The accounts he used on Skype, vk.com and his email address and telephone number also confirmed these assumptions. According to this, Badin is probably the author of malware that was used for the hacks of the MH-17 investigative team, the email server of the Democratic Party, the German Bundestag and Bellingcat itself. ==References== Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:GRU officers Category:People from Kursk Category:Russian military personnel ","title":"Dmitri Sergejewitsch Badin"},{"id":"63895282","text":"Plectotropis is a genus of air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Camaenidae.MolluscaBase eds.

He served as Organist at All Saints church, Isleworth for thirty years. He was a pupil of William Boyce, (1711‚Äì79). Boyce had been a pupil Johann Christoph Pepusch (1666/7‚Äì1752), who was greatly interested in Greek music and the music of antiquity: Boyce followed this interest. On Boyce's death, Overend bought his teacher's manuscripts. Overend constructed elaborate mathematical tables noting the relationship between note values, or intervals. He assisted John Hawkins by transcribing early musical examples for inclusion in the latter's History of Music, 1776. He published in 1781 a prospectus for a series of lectures on the science of music, titled A Brief account of, and an introduction to, eight lectures, in the Science of Music ... . Marmaduke Overend died at Isleworth on 25 June 1790, describing himself in his will as ‚ÄòStudent of Music‚Äô (ODNB); Laetitia Matilda Hawkins, described him as the ‚ÄúScientific Organist of Isleworth.‚Äù Following Overend's death, his library was sold in 1791 by Egerton Bros. His manuscript volumes, as well as Boyce's treatise, were bought by John Wall Callcott, (1766‚Äì1821) who used these manuscripts as sources for his own work. In 1807, Callcott donated all the manuscripts to the Royal Institution, where they were consulted by John Farey Sr and informed his writings on music theory in Rees's Cyclop√¶dia and the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia: the manuscripts include Farey's MS notes. Farey's writings in the two works comprise more than 350 articles. The manuscripts were moved in 1972 to the Bodleian Library, Overend MS. Don c.136-42. They comprise now one volume by Boyce, six by Overend and two by Callcott, nine volumes in all, but Farey noted in his article on the Farey Notation, Edinburgh Encyclopaedia, vol 9, p 274, that he consulted fourteen volumes, so it must be presumed that five have been lost. A brief life by W. H. Hadow was published in the 2nd edition of Grove. It lists his compositions and mentions his work on musical theory and his manuscripts.

It consists of simultaneously injecting two sinusoidal signals of different frequencies (tones) into the component or system. Intermodulation distortion usually occurs in active components like amplifiers, but can also occur in some circumstances in passive items such as cable connectors, especially at high power. Measurement in two-tone testing is most commonly done by examining the output of the device under test (DUT) with a spectrum analyser with which intermodulation products can be directly observed. Sometimes this is not possible with complete systems and instead the consequences of intermodulation are observed. For instance, in a radar system the result of intermodulation might be the generation of false targets. == Rationale == An electronic device can be tested by applying a single frequency to its input and measuring the response at its output. If there is any non-linearity in the device, this will cause harmonic distortion at the output. This kind of distortion consists of whole-number multiples of the applied signal frequency, as well as the original frequency being present at the device output. Intermodulation distortion can produce outputs at other frequencies. The new frequencies created by intermodulation are the sum and difference of the injected frequencies and the harmonics of these. Intermodulation effects cannot be detected with single-tone testing, but they may be just as, or more undesirable than harmonic distortion depending on their frequency and level.Pedro & Carvalho, pp. 25‚Äì26 Two-tone testing can also be used to determine the discrimination of a radio receiver. That is, the ability of the receiver to distinguish between transmissions close in frequency.Avionics Dept., p. 5-7.7 == Testing == General test setup for two-tone testing === Component testing === Circuit components such as amplifiers can be tested using the two-tone method with a test setup like that shown in the figure. Two signal generators, set to two different frequencies F1 and F2, are fed into a power combiner through circulators. The combiner needs to have good isolation to prevent the signal from one generator being sent to the output of the other. If this happens, intermodulation can occur in the non-linear parts of the generator internal circuit. The resulting intermodulation products will give a false result to the test. The circulators are there to provide even more isolation between the generators and isolation between any signal that might get reflected back from the device under test (DUT) and the generator. The circulators have one port connected to a resistive load so that they act as isolators. Low-pass filters may also be provided at the generator outputs to remove any harmonic distortion. These harmonics could cause unexpected intermodulation products in the DUT, again giving misleading results. The output of the DUT is fed to a spectrum analyser where the results are observed, possibly via an attenuator to reduce the signal to a level the instrument can cope with.  Passive components  Passive components such as cables, connectors and antennas, are generally expected to be linear and therefore not liable to generate any intermodulation. However, especially at high power, a number of effects can lead to non-linearity through formation of a metal-semiconductor junction at what is supposed to be a metal-metal junction. These effects include corrosion, surface oxidisation, dirtiness, and simple failure to fully make mechanical contact. Some passive materials are intrinsically non-linear. These include ferrites, ferrous metals, and carbon- fibre composites.Pozar, p. 519 Intermodulation distortion is a particularly difficult problem at the cellular base stations of mobile phone cellular networks. These have to deal with multiple transmissions at closely spaced frequencies and it is necessary to ensure that these do not interact with each other. A typical specification is that intermodulation products should not exceed in the presence of transmissions. This equates to a requirement for a signal to intermodulation ratio of , an exceedingly stringent specification. To achieve this, materials and components must be chosen with great care and installation and maintenance done to a high standard. Likewise, two-tone testing of these components needs to be done with great care and precision since intermodulation products at these low levels can easily be generated within the test setup accidentally.Pozar, p. 519 There is an international standard, IEC 62037 \\"Passive RF and microwave devices, intermodulation level measurement\\", for measuring intermodualtion distortion of passive components. Testing to the standard ensures that specifications from different manufacturers are done under the same conditions and can be compared with each other.Linkhart, p. 272 Militaries will typically use their own standards for testing. For instance US procurement contracts may specify MIL- STD-461.Avionics Dept., p. 5-7.1 === Receiver testing === Two-tone receiver testing using direct injectionAvionics Dept., p. 5-7.1 Two-tone receiver testing using off-air methodAvionics Dept., pp. 5-7.1‚Äì5-7.2 A test setup suitable for testing receivers at microwave frequencies is shown in the figure. The two signal generators, F1 and F2, are combined using a directional coupler in reverse. That is, the two generators are connected to what would normally be the coupled and transmitted output ports respectively. The combined signal appears at what would normally be the input port. The advantage of using a directional coupler rather than a simple summing circuit is that the directional coupler provides isolation between the two generators. As with the component testing, another signal being injected into the output of a signal generator can cause intermodulation distortion within the generator. Isolators are included in the test set up as with the component testing.Avionics Dept., p. 5-7.1 The combined test signal can be injected directly in to the receiver if the antenna is removable. A second directional coupler, connected in the conventional configuration, can be used to provide a feed of the input to a spectrum analyser. This allows confirmation that the input signal is free of intermodulation products. If the test signal cannot be directly injected, for instance, because the receiver uses an active antenna, then the test signal is transmitted through its own transmitting antenna. A feed for a spectrum analyser can be provided by connecting a receiving antenna to its input. Tests done by the latter method are normally performed in an anechoic chamber to avoid broadcasting the test signal to the world at large.Avionics Dept., pp. 5-7.1‚Äì5-7.2 The consequences of intermodulation distortion depend on the nature and purpose of the receiver. For a set receiving audio, it can manifest itself as an interfering signal making the wanted station unintelligible. In a radar receiver, it can manifest as a false detection of a target.Avionics Dept., p. 5-7.9 === Transmitter testing === For transmitters that are designed for the transmission of speech or music, two frequencies within the audio band can be injected into the normal input of the transmitter. The output of the transmitter can be examined with a spectrum analyzer to look for intermodulation products. This kind of end-to-end testing tests all parts of the transmitter for non-linearity: from the audio stage, through the mixing and IF amplifier, to the final RF power amplifier. Likewise, a transmitter used for passing data can be injected with two frequencies within the baseband of the data stream. In some cases, there is no accessible input to a transmitter. Radar transmitters, for instance, do not take an input; the circuitry generating the radar signal is internal to the transmitter. In such cases the tones must be injected at some internal point of the device, or else the amplifiers and other stages must be tested as separate components.Ghannouchi et al., pp. 156‚Äì157 A dummy load may be connected to the output of the transmitter to prevent it actually broadcasting, and a directional coupler, possibly together with an attenuator, used to provide a feed to the spectrum analyser.Carr, pp. 224‚Äì226 The spacing in frequency between the two tones is of some significance in transmitter testing. The spacing determines whether intermodulation products are going to be in-band or out-of-band. That is, whether or not they occur within the band that the transmitter is designed to operate. In-band intermodulation is problematic because it interferes with the operation of the transmitter. However, out-of-band intermodulation can be an even greater problem. In most countries the telecommunications authority licenses the operator to use specific frequencies. Out-of-band signals are required to be virtually suppressed altogether. However, the greater frequency difference between the wanted and unwanted signal makes out-of-band intermodulation products relatively easy to remove with filters.Pedro & Carvalho, p. 39 Just as two tones provide a more realistic test than a single tone, multi-tone testing can be used to even better simulate the behaviour of a real signal. The idea is to spread the tones over the bandwidth of the real signal with a similar frequency power density. For accurate results, it is important that the phase of the tones relative to each other is considered. It is usually undesirable that the tones are in a synchronised phase relationship as this can give misleading results. For this reason, it is often endeavoured to generate tones with random phases in multi-tone testing.Ghannouchi et al., pp. 157‚Äì158 == References == == Bibliography == * Avionics Department, Electronic Warfare and Radar Systems Engineering Handbook 4th edition, Naval Air Warefare Center Weapons Division, October 2013, NACWD Tech.

The oldest part of the facility, the curved municipal offices, which is the headquarters of Lewisham London Borough Council, is a Grade II listed building. ==History== The building has its origins in a local vestry hall commissioned for the benefit of the Parish of St Laurence. The foundation stone for the vestry hall was laid by the Chairman of the Board of Works, James Brooker, on 27 July 1874.Foundation stone lying in Manor House Gardens The vestry hall was designed by George Elkington in the Gothic style, completed in 1875 and was extended to accommodate the headquarters of the new Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham in 1901. In the late 1920s civic leaders considered that additional facilities were needed accommodate the work of the borough. They resolved to create a curved structure, designed by Bradshaw Gass & Hope in the Art Deco style, incorporating a concert hall, to the east of the vestry hall. The construction work, which was carried out by G. E. Wallis & Sons began in May 1930. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with 23 bays facing onto Rushey Green; the central section of four bays featured a doorway with canopy above on the ground floor; there were a series of tall windows interspersed with pilasters on the first and second floors and a series of smaller triple-arched windows on the third floor; an octagonal cupola with weather vane was erected on the roof. This structure, referred to as the \\"town hall extension\\" was officially opened by the Duke of York on 22 June 1932. During the Second World War, an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the bombing of Sandhurst Road School by enemy aircraft on 20 January 1943, which resulted in deaths of 38 children and 6 staff, was held in the town hall. A further extension in the form of a long curved block of offices to the north west was designed by M. H. Forward in the Modernist style and built in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The complex continued to be headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham for much of the 20th century and continued to be the local seat of government after the enlarged London Borough of Lewisham in 1965. A local activist, William Horton, had led a petition which was supported by John Betjeman to save the original vestry hall in the early 1960s. However, the new civic leaders insisted that the vestry hall had to be demolished in 1968 to make way for a \\"Civic Suite\\" which was designed by A Sutton and completed in November 1971. Meanwhile, on the south side of Catford Road, St Laurence's Church was also demolished in 1968 to make way for an additional office block for council use known as St Laurence's House. A statue by Gerda Rubinstein entitled Pensive Girl was unveiled outside the building in 1992. Protesters forced themselves into the town hall during demonstrations against council spending reductions in November 2010. ===Gallery=== File:Lewisham Town Hall circa 1900.jpgThe old vestry hall c. 1900 File:John Betjeman Reads William Horton's Petition to Save Lewisham Town Hall, 1961.jpgJohn Betjeman reads William Horton's petition to save the vestry hall (which can be seen in the background), 1961 File:Lewisham Civic Suite (geograph 3164949).jpgThe \\"Civic Suite\\" completed in 1971 ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Lewisham Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1932 Category:Grade II listed government buildings ","title":"Lewisham Town Hall"},{"id":"63895531","text":"James Leon Stanfield (born 1934) is a former Welsh international lawn bowler. ==Bowls career== Stanfield became the British singles champion after winning the British Isles Bowls Championships in 1966.

Few members of this gens occur in ancient writers, but many are known from inscriptions. Although at least some were of equestrian rank, and a number of Spurii held public offices in the various municipia, the most illustrious person of this name may have been Lucius Spurius Maximus, a tribune of the Vigiles at Rome during the reign of Septimius Severus. ==Origin== The nomen Spurius is a patronymic surname derived from the praenomen Spurius, without a change in morphology.Chase, p. 131. The original meaning of the praenomen is unclear; it was fairly common in the early Republic, and favoured in many prominent families, but grew less abundant over time, becoming rare by imperial times, probably due to its association with the adjective spurius, meaning \\"illegitimate\\".Chase, p. 153. An Etruscan origin has been proposed, in which the name might have meant something akin to \\"city dweller\\", and been synonymous with the Latin praenomen Publius.Deecke, \\"Der Dativ Larœëiale\\", p. 43. Although the praenomen eventually vanished into obscurity, as a gentilicium, Spurius remained common throughout the centuries of the empire. ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Spurii were Lucius and Gaius, the two most common names throughout Roman history. To a lesser degree, they used a variety of other common praenomina, including Marcus, Quintus, Aulus, and Sextus. Among the more unusual praenomina they used was the Oscan name Ovius, known from the filiation of one of the Spurii at Puteoli in Campania. ==Members== * Spuria A. l., a freedwoman named in an inscription from Rome.. * Spuria L. l., a freedwoman buried in a family sepulchre at Rome, dating to the first half of the first century, and dedicated by her son, Lucius Spurius Communis, for his mother, his brother, Lucius Spurius Picentinus, patron, Lucius Spurius Heracles, and Visena Olympia.. * Aulus Spurius C. f., dedicated a second-century tomb at Rome for his brother, Gaius Spurius Maximus, a soldier in the Praetorian Guard.. * Gaius Spurius, made an offering to Mercury at Boutae in Gallia Narbonensis.. * Gaius Spurius, buried in a second century tomb at Caesarea in Mauretania Caesariensis.. * Gnaeus Spurius Ov. f., the husband of Singullia, and father of Marcus Spurius and Gnaeus Spurius Frugi, named in an inscription from Puteoli in Campania, dating from the last quarter of the second century BC.. * Lucius Spurius, a soldier named in an inscription from Rome, dating from AD 134.Giacobelli, Gli d√®i propizi, p. 418. * Lucius Spurius, the former master of Spuria Pieris, Lucius Spurius Theophanes, and Lucius Spurius Fortunatus.. * Marcus Spurius Cn. f.

Both were later victims of McCarthy era censorship. She held a BA (Smith College, 1947), MS in Economics (Columbia University, 1953), and a PhD in Economics (University of Wisconsin, 1968) that was supervised by Kenneth H. Parsons (Ghana‚Äôs Development Experience 1951-1966). Between 1958 and 1962 she was lecturer in Economics at Bridgeport University. She began lecturing in the Department of Economics at the University of Ghana in 1962 with her husband, legal scholar Robert B. Seidman, who had tired of legal practice in the US. She was an advisor to Ghana's first president, President Kwame Nkrumah on an economic theory and strategy, attending the second Pan- Africanist Conference in Cairo in 1964 and the third in Accra in 1965. She traveled widely in West Africa, across the former British and French colonies. After the 1966 coup against Nkrumah, she and her family were deported, and worked in Lagos, Nigeria. After completing her PhD and moving around Africa with her husband, she was variously lecturer in Economics at the University of Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania (1968‚Äì1970), was head of the Department of Economics at the University of Lusaka in Zambia (1972‚Äì1974), and was later Head of Department at the University of Zimbabwe (1980-1983). In 1995 she was Distinguished Visiting Professor at the University of the Witswatersrand in South Africa. In the 1970s, she successfully sued Brown University for discrimination after it reversed a decision to offer her a named Chair and Professorship. She refused to work there and never secured a permanent post in the US. Based from Boston, she taught classes for many years at Clark University and was affiliated to Boston University as Adjunct Professor. She was a Fulbright Professor at Peking University in Beijing, 1988‚Äì1989. ==Expertise== Seidman published in law and development, planning policy, and dependency theory. Trained in neoclassical economics, her work soon became rooted in political economy. Her work in Ghana in the 1960s, published in 1968 with Reginald Green as Unity or Poverty? The Economics of Pan-Africanism was a call to re-order African economies under political and economic unification: they were \\"trying to create a new theory of market integration and a series of policy measures which truly reflected the characteristics and the needs of the African continent, and at the same time could support Nkrumah‚Äôs call for continental planning and political union\\" (Gerardo Serra, 2014) The focus of her work shifted to the use of democratic legislative tools as part of successful economic and political integration for developing countries. She advocated the use of law to construct institutional change that could redress embedded socio-economic inequalities. She and her husband founded the International Consortium for Law and Development (ICLAD) in 2004. They taught short courses in law and development and legislative drafting around the world. They helped draft constitutions for Namibia, Somalia, Iraq, and Afghanistan. ==Personal life== Ann Seidman married Robert B. Seidman just after the Second World War, and they were together for around 70 years. He was latterly Emeritus Professor in the Boston University School of Law, where he taught from 1974‚Äì2013. Ann and Bob Seidman had five children, some of whom are also academics and with whom they have co-published: Jonathan Seidman (professor of genetics), Judy Seidman (artist and activisthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OKa6C-izL4), Katha Seidman, Gay Seidman (sociology professor) and Neva Seidman Makgetla (writer, activist with the ANC, former economics professor). The Seidmans were among several families, including Ann's parents Anita and Henry Willcox, who established one of the first interracial planned communities on the East Coast of the US, at Village Creek in Norwalk, Connecticut in the 1950s, and some of their children were born there.

His father, August von Mackensen (1849‚Äì1945), was eventually, in 1915, promoted to the rank of Field Marshall: Even after 1918, August von Mackensen would remain an unapologetic high- profile monarchist traditionalist who in 1941, despite his advanced age and the difficulties of travelling in war time, made his way to Doorn (near Utrecht) where, dressed in his full military uniform from the imperial years, he attended the funeral of the former German emperor. Hans Georg von Mackensen's mother, born Dorothea von Horn (1854‚Äì1905), also came from a family of minor aristocrats. His younger brother, Eberhard von Mackensen became an army general. As a child Hans Georg grew up as a companion to Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia, one of the emperor's younger sons. The two men became life-long friends. In 1902 he entered the army as a trainee officer in the 1st Foot Guards regiment. He continued to serve after completing his training in 1907. However, in 1911 he withdrew from active service, becoming a reserve officer, in order to complete his study of Jurisprudence, after which he entered the Prussian legal service. === War years and entry to the diplomatic service === During the First World War von Mackensen returned to the army, serving between 1914 and 1917 as adjutant to his friend Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia, and ending up with the rank of \\"Hauptmann\\" (Captain). After the war ended he took a job with the Prussian Ministry of Justice, staying till May 1919, the month in which he accepted an invitation to switch to the Foreign Ministry. In 1923 he was posted as a diplomatic envoy (\\"Gesandtschaftsrat II. Klasse\\") to the embassy in Rome between 1923 and 1926, which was followed by a posting to Brussels between 1926 and 1931. === Marriage === On 10 August 1926 von Mackensen married Winifred Christine Helene Baroness of Neurath (1904 - 1985) at the Leinfelder Hof just outside the little town of Vaihingen (near Stuttgart). He thereby acquired as a father-in- law Konstantin von Neurath (1873 - 1956), a long-standing friend of his father's and now a rising star in the diplomatic service: Baron von Neurath would later become Germany's Foreign Minister. Back in 1916, at the height of the First World War, when she was aged just eleven, Winifred had presented a bunch of flowers to the glamorous young hussar Hans Georg von Mackensen, on his return from a mission to Constantinople. The glamour and extent of the celebrations in 1926, along with the presence of various members of the pre-1918 traditionalist-monarchist elite, hinted at a political or dynastic dimension to the union. === Career progression as a diplomat === Close family links on various sides to the aristocratic-military elite from the days of empire continued to prove no bar to von Mackensen's career progression in the diplomatic service of the German Republic. Despite his relative inexperience and youth, in 1929 he was given temporary charge over the German diplomatic mission to Tirana, at what was an exceptionally critical time for the developing relationship between Albania's ambitious new king and the rest of Europe. In July 1931, a couple of months after republican government replaced the Spanish monarchy, von Mackensen was transferred again, to be appointed \\"first diplomat councillor\\" (Botschaftsrat) at the embassy in Madrid. === R√©gime change === Following months of political deadlock, everything changed in January 1933 when the Hitler government, spotting a power vacuum, filled it: they lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. There are no indications that Hans Georg von Mackensen had taken much interest in the party politics of the German Republic up to this point. Nevertheless, in May 1933 he signed up as a member of the National Socialist (\\"Nazi\\") Party. In September 1933 his transfer to Budapest was announced, and in December he took up a posting as the new government's \\"first councillor\\" (Botschaftsrat) in the Hungarian capital. Ambassador-level diplomatic relations having at this stage not been established with former component states of the Austro- Hungarian empire, that made him Germany's senior \\"permanent diplomatic representative\\" in Budapest. === From Secretary of State to Ambassador in Rome === Four years later von Mackensen was recalled to Berlin where, on 16 April 1937, he took over as first Secretary of State at the Foreign Ministry. The appointment had been announced less than a month earlier, on 24 March 1937. He thereby became the senior non-politician at the Foreign Ministry. It was a position that had been vacant since the death the previous summer of the former incumbent, Bernhard von B√ºlow, possibly from natural causes. As first Secretary of State von Mackensen's political boss was the German Foreign Minister, Konstantin von Neurath, who also happened to be his father-in-law. Von Neurath had been in post since 1932, but on 4 February 1938 he was removed from office and replaced a short notice by Joachim von Ribbentrop, reflecting a determination on the part of the leader to take a more \\"personally hands-on\\" approach to Germany's foreign policy. As part of the ensuing reshuffle at the top of the diplomatic service, Hans Georg von Mackensen was appointed Ambassador to Rome in succession to Ulrich von Hassell, who had been recalled at short notice in the aftermath of the so-called Blomberg‚ÄìFritsch affair. Von Macksensen might no longer be first Secretary of State, but the Rome embassy was, in the context of the diplomatic developments of the time, an exceptionally important posting. There were suggestions within and beyond the diplomatic establishment that his unusually rapid rise through the ranks of the German diplomatic service had been both the result of his inherited family connections and a direct reflection of von Mackensen's uncritical and unhesitating execution of every order he received from his superiors, combined with an apparent reluctance to feed any ideas of his own back to Berlin. Someone else who declined to be dazzled by von Mackensen's diplomatic cachet was the French ambassador to Berlin, Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet: \\"J‚Äôai visit√© l‚ÄôAusw√§rtiges Amt; j‚Äôai vu le p√®re, et j‚Äôai vu le fils, mais je n‚Äôai pas vu le Saint Esprit\\". On 30 January 1942 the German ambassador to Rome nevertheless received the considerable honour of being appointed an SS Group Leader (\\"Gruppenf√ºhrer\\") on the staff of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler. === Military crisis and consequences === The Anglo-American invasion of Sicily in July 1943 brought forward various crises for Benito Mussolini, including a crisis in his relationship with his dictator-ally in Berlin. On 25 July 1943, following a (completely unprecedented)overnight vote of no confidence by the Grand Council of Fascism, the king found the courage to dismiss Mussolini and, four days later, had him arrested. The king told Pietro Badoglio that he would shortly be sworn in as the new prime minister, but in the event it would be around six weeks before Badoglio took formal control over what remained of Italy: in the intervening weeks confusion and uncertainty reigned in Rome. Around Adolf Hitler there was consternation, even before Mussolini's dismissal, over the disastrous performance and poor morale of the Italian army. The German army could, they believed, defend the Italian peninsular successfully, but for that they would need Mussolini's support. Mussolini failed either to galvanised his own generals or to provide his ally with clear answers and a group of advisors around Hitler, led by the army chief, General Alfred Jodl urged him to send an ultimatum to Mussolini, insisting on the need for agreement before 15 July 1943. Failing that, Mussolini needed to take drastic and immediate steps himself to arrest and reverse the deteriorating military situation. The German ambassador in Italy, Hans Georg von Mackensen, was naturally involved in theses discussions, and suggested that the hugely admired Field Marshal Rommel might be given military command over Italy. The crisis culminated in a hastily arranged meeting at Feltre (near Belluno in northern Italy) between Hitler and Mussolini which took place on 19 July 1943, less than a week before Mussolini's dismissal by his king. The meeting was not a success, in that the dictators were evidently both surprised and disappointed by one another. Most of the time together was taken up with a furious two hour harang by Adolf Hitler. Since the facts on the ground and reactions to them in Rome and Berlin were highly fluid over the next few days, the details of the differing opinions between Adolf Hitler and Hans Georg von Mackensen that the crisis drew out are not entirely clear. What is clear is that on 2 August 1943, following a talk with Hitler, von Macksensen was relieved of his post. === Later years === He nevertheless retained his position as a general in the SS. That was the capacity in which he participated at the Group Leaders' congress, held during the first week of October 1943 in the city hall at Posen (as Pozna≈Ñ was known till 1944/45). He was thereby able to hear for himself the first of the subsequently infamous Posen speeches delivered by Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Himmler.Romuald Karmakar, Das Himmler-Projekt, DVD 2000, Berlin, . In May 1945 he was captured by French forces, held as a prisoner of war till April 1946. Following his release he remained in the French occupation zone, dying in a Konstanz hospital on 28 September 1947. He had been a top official at the German Foreign Ministry in 1938, at the time of the German invasion of Czechoslovakia. He had been scheduled to appear at a forthcoming trial as a witness on German-Italian negotiations during the build up to that invasion. His death from lung cancer meant that he was spared the court appearance. ==Notes== ==References== Category:German military personnel of World War I Category:Ambassadors of Germany to Italy Category:Nazi Party members Category:Nazi Germany politicians Category:SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Category:1883 births Category:1947 deaths Category:People from Berlin ","title":"Hans Georg von Mackensen"},{"id":"63896679","text":"James Beverly Langford (April 11, 1922 - April 14, 1996) was an American lawyer and politician. ==Biography== Langford was born in Calhoun, Georgia and graduated from Calhoun High School.

He devoted the first half of his career from 1892 to 1920 to pastoral work, preaching and education in the Italian and Slovenian regions of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. ==Training and ministry in the Austro-Hungarian Empire == Antonino Zecchini was born on 7 December 1864 in Visco, a town now in the Province of Udine, Italy, then part of the Austrian Empire. He studied in Gorizia. He entered the Jesuits and studied at their novitiates in France and Spain. He wrote that he hoped to work in mission countries, especially \\"the Austrian coast because I like the Friulian, Italian, German and Slovenian languages\\". From 1883 to 1886 he studied philosophy in Portor√®; from 1887 to 1890 he taught Latin and Greek at the Jesuit high school in Zadar. He was ordained a priest in 1892 and in 1897 he went to Soresina, now in the Italian Province of Cremona, to study theology. From 1898 to 1921 he performed pastoral work in and around Gorizia while also teaching languages and canon law. During the First World War, he was in charge of missions for refugees and the sick in Trieste. ==Diplomacy and administration in the Baltic nations== In 1921, the Holy See sent him as an Apostolic Visitor to assess the situation of Catholics in the three newly independent Baltic nations. On 25 October 1922, Pope Pius XI named him titular archbishop of Myra and Apostolic Delegate to Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. He received his episcopal consecration on 21 December 1922 from Cardinal Andreas Fr√ºhwirth. Over the next 15 years, his work took a very different shape in each of these countries. ;Lithuania Of the three Baltic nations, Lithuania had the largest Catholic population and Zecchini chose to live in Kaunas at first but his relationship with the government was always contentious and he left within a year. In the ongoing conflict between Lithuania and Poland, the Holy See found it far more important to develop good relations with Poland, which provoked popular hostility in Lithuania and made Zecchini's position untenable. After years without meaningful progress in building a relationship with successive Lithuanian governments, he was replaced as Delegate to Lithuania on 10 March 1927 by Lorenzo Schioppa. ;Estonia Estonia had a tiny Catholic population. On 1 November 1924, Pope Pius XI appointed Zecchini Apostolic Administrator of Estonia, a new ecclesiastical jurisdiction created that day by taking territory from the Diocese of Riga in Latvia. It consisted of just four parishes. Zecchini initiated discussions for a concordat between the Holy See and Estonia. On 11 May 1931, he was succeeded as Administrator by Eduard Profittlich, another Jesuit. Zecchini resigned as Apostolic Delegate to Estonia on 22 October 1933. ;Latvia Zecchini settled in Riga, Latvia, after assessing the situation in Lithuania. He was the key Church official working on the concordat that Latvia and the Holy See signed on 30 May 1922. He continued to build the Holy See's relationship with the Latvian government. Without the challenge presented in Lithuania by Polish claims, the Vatican could make a supportive gesture, for example, by raising the status of the Diocese of Riga to an Archdiocese on 25 October 1923. On 14 April 1926, Pope Pius named him Apostolic Internuncio to Latvia. Zecchini died in Riga on 17 March 1935 at the age of 70. ==Notes== ==References == ;Additional sources * * Category:1864 births Category:1935 deaths Category:People from the Province of Udine Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Estonia Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Latvia Category:Apostolic Nuncios to Lithuania ","title":"Antonino Zecchini"},{"id":"63897051","text":"Henrika ≈†antel, self-portrait Henrika ≈†antel (17 August 1874, Gorizia ‚Äî 15 February 1940, Ljubljana) was a Slovenian realist painter. ≈†antel was born in Gorizia (Northwest-Italy), then part of the Austria-Hungary.

Haberkorn arrived in Brazil as an immigrant in the 1930s, accompanied by his wife Luise. Together with his brother, Geraldo Haberkorn, he founded one of the most important postcard companies in the country, Fotolabor. It produced thousands of postcards throughout the 1940s and 1950s, many of which were widely circulated. Haberkorn body of work allows the visualization of the urban transformation of the city of S√£o Paulo in the mid-20th century. Werner Haberkorn died in 1997 at the age of 90. He left a legacy of aerial photographs, panoramic views, advertising stills, postcards, albums and photographic montages. A large body of his work is located at the Werner Haberkorn Collection at the Paulista Museum of the University of S√£o Paulo. The remainder of his archive remains with his children. ==Personal life== Werner Haberkorn was born on March 12, 1907, in Mislowitz (Mys≈Çowice) in the Upper Silesia region. Upper Silesia belonged to Germany at the time of his birth, but today is part of Poland. His family was financially secure and established their businesses in Breslau, now Wroc≈Çaw. Among Otto and Emmy Haberkorn's three children, Werner was the oldest. His father, Otto, worked in several commercial areas, two of which were hospitality and metallurgy, in addition to being the owner of a cigarette factory. Haberkorn graduated in 1930 from Technische Hochschule de Breslau, now the Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. He graduated with a degree as a machine engineer, specializing in aircraft mechanics. Before opening his own company, he worked for a period at Junkers, the German aircraft and aircraft engine manufacturer. Haberkorn was a photography hobbyist, and was influenced mainly by his father, who shared the same passion. As an amateur photographer during the 1930s, he dedicated himself to recording his travels in Europe, and maintained numerous albums. These collections are currently held by the family and express Haberkorn's attention to the landscape, with a focus on urbanized spaces. The photographer's first trip in Brazil was in 1936. He recorded daily life in Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo, as well as life in factories and streets and some landscape photographs. Germany, at that time, was under the Nazi regime, responsible for the persecution of people of Jewish descent. In this political context, one of the motivations of his trip to Brazil was to spread information about Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo as possible destinations for Jewish communities willing to leave German and its associated territories. On the way to Brazil with the ship Jamaique, Werner passed through Lisbon, also photographing the route, until he reached Brazil. He toured Petr√≥polis, Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo, staying for a month and a half in Brazil. The entire itinerary of the trip was recorded by photographs that made up an album. These records, however, remained in Germany, even after his immigration to Brazil. After the trip, Haberkorn gave some lectures in Germany on Brazil to Jewish communities. He used his body of photography from his 1936 to explain conditions of daily life in Brazil. ===Immigration=== Haberkorn arrived in Brazil as an immigrant in 1937, a year after his initial visit to the country. He was the first of his family to settle in Brazil. He, together with his wife, settled in the city of S√£o Paulo between June and July 1937. He and his wife lived in the region of Vale do Anhangaba√∫ and Pra√ßa da Rep√∫blica for a period. The city's entertainment sector, such as cinemas and museums, was concentrated in the two neighborhoods. Haberkorn did not work in photography at first; he was the commercial representative of a German manufacturer. Werner left his role as a spokesman for the company, as there was great difficulty in importing the machinery from Germany as a consequences of World War II. Geraldo Haberkorn, his brother, attended the Bermpohl Institute in Germany and graduated in 1938. The name of the institute was a tribute to the creator of a color photographic system, Wilhelm Bermpohl. It was in this environment that Geraldo learned one of the techniques of color photography, which became known as the Bermpohl System. This system was based on trichromy; a camera was used to generate three negatives, allowing the reconstitution of colors at the time of the production of the positive copy. Geraldo moved to Brazil in 1939, bringing from Germany a copy of the Bermpohl machine and another one of photocopies. He additionally had a knowledge of photochromic procedures. Geraldo Haberkorn initially worked at Fot√≥ptica but joined Werner in 1940. The two founded Fotolabor in the same year. Haberkorn and his wife converted to Catholicism between 1939 and 1940. Luise's parents and brothers moved to Brazil in 1939. Werner's first daughter, Vera, was born in 1940. Three years later, the couple had a son, Ernesto. Although they helped in the family business while, the photographer's children did not follow their father's career. ==Career in Brazil== Werner Haberkorn in front of Fotolabor, S√£o Paulo There was a fine line between Haberkorn's personal life and the company, Fotolabor. Although he is not recognized as a prominent photographer in Brazil, his images are of great importance to study the urban transformations of the city of S√£o Paulo throughout part of the 20th century. His company was also one of the most active publishers of postcards in S√£o Paulo. According to his daughter, Vera Flieg, Werner did not see his profession as an art, but rather as an extremely technical endeavor. ===Fotolabor=== The Haberkorn brothers' company was founded in 1940. In addition to the photocopy brought from Germany by Geraldo, the beginning of Fotolabor was marked by the use of the coloring technique. The outbreak of World War II caused problems with the supply of raw materials needed for some of the equipment. The consequence of this was the end of the use of the Bermpohl photochromic system, which was also already being overtaken by new techniques and becoming commercially unfeasible. The company initially offered photocopying service and did works aimed at industrial photography, creating product catalogs and advertising for various brands. Fotolabor was also impacted by restrictions and surveillance by Brazilian authorities during World War II. Orders placed by the company went through inspection authorities to ensure that they were not purchases of explosive materials, weapons, or ammunition. These restrictions affected not only Fotolabor, but also other photography professionals who had immigrated at the same time. The company's location was favorable to the brothers' business, as it was close to the Post Office and in the region of the city where the greatest changes brought about by modernity were taking place. Werner also attributed part of Fotolabor's success to a photocopy machine. Only two establishments had this equipment in the region of the old center of S√£o Paulo, and the company of the Haberkorn brothers was one of them. The photocopy machine provided initial income for the family business. This income, for example, was what allowed the use of the Bermpohl staining system. It is possible to say that Haberkorn's photography was exclusively linked to commercial, rather than artistic, concerns. Even the name of the business refers to its commercial aspect, with \\"labor\\" as part of the company name. According to advertisements in telephone directories, Fotolabor offered photo-retouching, advertising, catalogs, clich√©s and photocopying services from 1944 to 1946. The company expanded the services in 1950, adding developing, color copies, and photography for industry and commerce. ===Postcards=== Fotolabor published postcards beginning in 1942; it was initially a source of supplementary income for the company. As industrial photography market was seasonal, Werner produced postcards to complement the company's income. The postcards, however, started to have an increasing circulation, making this one of its main activities for a period of time. The central theme of its postcards were cityscapes and changes in large urban centers such as S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. It is important to note that not all postcards had images made by Haberkorn. In the case of photographs of football teams and artists, for example, he only bought negatives to reproduce in postcard format. One of Fotolabor's most active years was 1950, when the company became one of the largest producers of photographic postcards in S√£o Paulo. The city's industrialization process happened simultaneously to Fotolabor's success, and continued throughout the 1950s. S√£o Paulo was going through great transformations, undergoing great urban and cultural changes. As a result of this economic and social change, Fotolabor's photographs also began to receive new treatments and uses. Another point that interfered with the circulation of photos was the increase in consumption by the population. The company increased to 40 professionals to accommodate this great production. They performed developing, processing, enlarging, and catalog assembly. Around 1955 they opened a Fotolabor branch, but there they offered the service of a third-party photography laboratory. Despite all the success, the end of the era of Fotolabor's postcards was not long in coming. Photo processing machines were very expensive and color films were already becoming very popular. The Haberkorn brothers made an attempt to print the postcard with colors, but the quality of the chosen process was low and they were not successful. The interest of the consumer market was also changing, already being modified by the development of television and telephony. As a result, Fotolabor ceases to publish postcards in the late 1950s. === The final years of Fotolabor === Fotolabor operated in the advertising market until 1970s, working with both small agencies and larger companies, such as Colabor and Panam Propaganda. At the same time, the company entered the cinema exhibition market, offering the production of slides for television. The Haberkorn brothers' company operated for five decades, ending its activities in 1990. Werner was responsible for keeping Fotolabor running until the last year of its operation, since Geraldo's unit closed its activities in the 1980s. The company's facilities and equipment were gradually passed on to its employees. === Photography === Panoramic view of S√£o Paulo city center Haberkorn's photography was essentially technical and his main objective was to document the changes brought about by modernity and the development of the city. In addition, his photomontages always followed a creative line. Most of the Fotolabor postcards were undated so that they could be resold in successive year. Werner initially worked in industrial photography, taking jobs linked to architectural projects and other commercial photography. Unlike other companies of the time, he is not interested in portrait photography, and always preferred technical photography. Haberkorn preferred advertising-style work; it was a way to showcase his company's products. Photography served as a way to view objects in different ways and to discern details previously ignored. Another Haberkorn characteristic within the medium was sensing what his individual clients wanted, adapting his photographic techniques according to the project and client. Because the market is relatively new, there was some complication in accessing equipment and supplies. The camera he had brought with him from Germany, for example, was not ideal for technical photography. For this reason, he changed his camera at Casa Kosmos and, over the years, changed equipment according to the need for new technology. Throughout his career, Haberkorn recording the \\"before and after\\" of many spaces in S√£o Paulo. He was careful to choose the same angles and places over the years to clarify changes to the urban landscape. This desire to continuously photograph the transformations that occurred in the city was clarified by his daughter, Vera Flieg. In order to highlight the verticalization of the city, Haberkorn gave preference to frames that contrasted vertical elements, especially in the case of buildings. The inversion of scales was also a strategy used by the photographer, exploring, for example, the contrast between new, tall, and modern buildings with low and old houses. Another technique of the photographer was to frame elements of nature in the foreground and, in the medium plane, buildings. The horizontal expansion of the city was highlighted in panoramic photographs or when traffic routes appeared in the foreground. Thus, the intention is to show the city as an environment of great circulation, be it people or goods. The records of the expansion suburban horizontal view also revealed the city beyond the verticalized core. In many of his photos, the scarce vegetation takes over from the foreground and in some cases is placed in contrast to a high building in the middle plane of the photograph. In general, Werner's photographs create the possibility of reconstructing, through them, a new concept of urban beauty.ref name=\\":2\\" /> In the beginning of the production of postcards, Haberkorn showed interest in scenes daily life and the banal. However, postcards with the scenes disappeared in time, as they had little commercial appeal. The photographer was also always attentive to the major issues in the media so that he could somehow make postcards related to them. Among these postcards of this type are the photo of the singer Francisco Alves, at the time called \\"Rei da Voz\\" of Brazil; and the postcard with the Brazilian football team from the 1950s and 1958. Postcards from soccer were always among the best sellers, especially on game days. At that time, Brazil started to be considered \\"the country of football\\". For this reason, employees worked harder when a game was taking place. Aerial photographs of the city of S√£o Paulo were also part of the countless photographic projects that became postcards. Werner had an acquaintance who was able to contact the Brazil Ministry of Aviation, allowing him access to an airplane in the 1940s to photograph the city, something that uncommon up to that point. In some of these projects, the angle chosen by the photographer does not show the sky and focuses only on the numerous buildings in the city of S√£o Paulo, always highlighting urbanization. Unlike other companies in the photographic market, which imported all equipment from abroad, Werner used his engineering knowledge to assemble a unique machine for one of Fotolabor's services. It was dedicated to the processing and automatic development of postcards, using a photographic paper from the manufacturer Domingos Bove. The equipment was designed to streamline the production of postcards, which is why automation of the service was so essential. Haberkorn also manually colored some of the postcards produced by Fotolabor. The colors had the function of highlighting some parts of the urban landscape; however, this process was only performed on more popular postcards. In these cases, their children Vera and Ernesto used to color the cards, working with the production and finishing team. Haberkorn took a course in Rio de Janeiro to learn about the colored photographic paper of the AGFA company. With this new technology, the photographer is able to differentiate himself in the advertising market, putting Fotolabor in the spotlight within this medium until its last years of operation. == Legacy == Legislative Assembly of the city of S√£o Paulo The establishment of Fotolabor was an important milestone for applied photography in Brazil, as well as in the field of advertising and industrial photography. To this day, its photographic style does not receive the same attention and recognition when compared to other iconographic genres. Through photographic collections, customer relations, purpose of orders and production records, it is possible to outline a general scenario of what the business models and strategies of marketing were like in the area of photography at that time, between the 1940s and 1960s, as well as getting to know the technical side of the photographs. In addition, Haberkorn's photography allows the visualization of the transformations of S√£o Paulo in the 1940s and 1950s, taking into account the changes in Brazilian infrastructure, lifestyle, and even changes in the urban design of the city. In the productions of this period, the two main factors of modernization are clear, namely verticalization, horizontal expansion, and self-mobilization. The fact that Fotolabor works for a while in the area of urban view meant that the photographer kept his attention on the primary symbolic points of the city, such as the Vale do Anhangaba√∫. Although his works are within a short period, each of the photographs allows the examination of the wider process of urbanization in Vale do Anhangaba√∫. This region was a favorite not only of Werner, but also of its competitors. They key symbols of the modernization of the city were located here, such as tall buildings and viaducts, were concentrated. Haberkorn's lenses registered from low buildings to their replacement with buildings with more than ten floors. The transformation of the streets and the traffic were also photographed, always highlighting elements of the streetscape. From his photographs, it is possible to notice the emergence of new forms of housing and buildings. The landscapes on the postcards also outline the main symbols of the city of S√£o Paulo of the period. In addition, the success of certain postcard themes outlines the most popular types of entertainment of the period, especially those linked to soccer and the music industry. Currently, the Werner Haberkorn Collection is part of the collection of the Museu Paulista Collection, and was acquired in 1999. The photographs are exhibited to the general public, as well as information on his editing processes. The collection has more than 640 images, containing photos from S√£o Paulo, Campinas, Santos, Rio de Janeiro, as well as photos of products that they were probably used for showcase purposes by Fotolabor customers. The documentary part of the collection includes invoices, order forms, and advertising cards. The relevance of S√£o Paulo to Haberkorn's production is clear: 367 of them depict the city. Part of this collection was shown in the exhibition Werner Haberkorn e o Fotolabor, at Caixa Cultural S√£o Paulo in 2014. With part of the photographic and documentary set of the Haberkorn Collection, the public was able to have a greater contact with the photography market, mainly in the 1940s and 1950s. ==References== Category:1907 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Brazilian people of German descent Category:Brazilian photographers Category:20th-century Brazilian artists Category:20th-century photographers Category:German emigrants to Brazil Category:People from Mys≈Çowice ","title":"Werner Haberkorn"},{"id":"63897168","text":"Annette Wyrwoll (born 14 November 1955) is a German equestrian.

By the time firefighters arrived to stop the fire from spreading, the dome of the cathedral had collapsed and the rest of the building was already badly burnt. The dome collapsed, causing the loss of everything inside the building. According to Bishop Alain Proph√®te and Director Patrick Durandis, art objects and religious relics that were inside of the building were destroyed by the fire, but there were a few items close to the door that only suffered smoke damage. Even some exterior items were damaged because the fire was powerful. There was no electricity in the neighborhood the night of the fire. According to government officials, it will take time to build the Royal Chapel of Milot like it was before under the leadership of King Henri Christophe, but UNESCO offered help. ==Church background== Sans-Souci Palace King Henri Christophe had Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception built by Joseph Chery Warlock. The construction took place from 1810-1813. It is located at the entry to the Sans-Souci Palace, in the town of Milot, Nord, about 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) northeast of the Citadelle Laferri√®re, and 13 kilometers (8.1 mi) southwest of the Three Bays Protected Area. King, Henri Christophe The Sans-Souci Palace was the royal residence. Henri I lived there with his wife, Queen Marie-Louise, and their two daughters. It was the most important structure the king had built (including nine other palaces, fifteen castles, numerous forts, and sprawling summer homes on his twenty plantations. Before Sans-Souci was built, Milot used to be a French plantation that Christophe managed for a period during the Haitian Revolution. Under his administration, the palace was the site of opulent feasts and dances. It had beautiful arts, immense gardens, artificial springs, and a system of waterworks. Though Sans-Souci is now an empty place, at the time its splendor was noted by many foreign visitors. One American physician even remarked that it had \\"the reputation of having been one of the most magnificent edifices of the West Indies.\\" Citadelle Laferri√®re is located in the northern department of Haiti and the palace is surrounded by mountains and the surrounding area is very rich in trees. The oldest palace is now a tourist attraction visited by people from around the world. A severe earthquake in 1842 destroyed a considerable part of the palace and devastated the nearby city of Cap-Ha√Øtien; the palace was never rebuilt. The dome of the chapel, which collapsed during the earthquake, was rebuilt in 1970 by Haitian architect Albert Mangon√®s. The palace (before its destruction) was acknowledged by many to be the Caribbean equivalent of the Palace of Versailles in France. UNESCO designated it--and the Citadelle--World Heritage Sites in 1982. ==Fire== The whole building was already destroyed by the fire before firefighters arrived at the scene. Unfortunately, art objects and religious relics that were inside of the building were destroyed by the fire, and it was too late to save the building. According to Jacques Bernadin, the Mayor of Milot, the firefighters of the town hall of Cap-Haitien arrived on the scene two hours after being alerted, but it was too late. === Reactions === After the fire destroyed the church, Bishop Alain Proph√®te, Director Patrick Durandis lamented the neglect of cultural monuments and the youth demanded an investigation as well. *\\"This church is the pride of Milot. It‚Äôs the pride of the North. It‚Äôs the pride of Haiti.\\" -Alain Proph√®te, Bishop. *\\"Saturday and Sunday, there was no electricity in Milot so I find it hard to understand that the dome of the church caught fire. We cannot say that it is a short circuit: it has to be investigated right away. Even the park was closed due to the coronavirus epidemic, it is hard to understand.\\" -Patrick Durandis, Director ==Investigation== Days after the fire had destroyed the building, the national government asked officials in Milot to investigate the cause of the fire. == References == Royal Chapel of Milot fire Royal Chapel of Milot fire Royal Chapel of Milot fire Category:Burned buildings and structures Category:Fires in Haiti Category:Nord (Haitian department) ","title":"2020 Royal Chapel of Milot fire"},{"id":"63897374","text":"≈ûirin Tekeli (28 February 1944, Ankara ‚Äì 13 June 2017, Bodrum) was a feminist, academician, translator, writer, activist and one of the pioneers of second wave feminism in Turkey. ==Early life and education== After graduating from Ankara Kiz Lisesi in 1961, ≈ûirin Tekeli moved to France to learn French. By reading Simone de Beauvoir's work, she became familiar with feminism. In 1963 she began studying Law in Paris, however she transitioned to University of Lausanne in Switzerland to study social and political science. She graduated in 1967. ==Career== In 1967, she returned to Turkey and became the first female academician to enter the Chair in political science at Istanbul University. In 1973 she obtained her PhD with a thesis on David Easton's System Theory. In 1978, she obtained her associate professor title with her, at the time \\"controversial\\", habilitation thesis on women‚Äôs participation to politics named \\"Kadƒ±nlar ve Siyasal Toplumsal Hayat\\". (Women and Political Social Life). This thesis, had a great effect on her ideology, she recalls : \\"I was a \\"timid feminist\\" but by the time I finished it I saw clearly that women were being oppressed, exploited and excluded from the public sphere. It was not capitalism that was doing this, it was male dominance\\". After her thesis, she started working on elections. She returned to France and spent the academic year 1979‚Äì1980 at the Scientific Research National Center (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) (CNRS) with a scholarship, learning cartography. She, during this period, formed a computer database, with all the data concerning the elections in Turkey, and studied the sociology of elections in urban areas with Jean Ranger and his team. In 1980-81 she organized a seminar on the sociology of politics When the Council on Higher Education (Y√ºksek√∂ƒüretim Kurulu - Y√ñK) was established, after the 1980 Turkish coup d'√©tat, under the military government in Turkey, she resigned from her academic position as she believed that Y√ñK limited the freedom of thought and academia. This leave was originally temporary, as Tekeli hoped that Y√ñK would only exist for a few years, however, the institution still stands today. ==Activism== After she left academia, she began an active role in the feminist movement of Turkey. Seeing the 80s as the \\"years of action\\", she dedicated herself to ameliorate women's situation and raise awareness in Turkey via campaigns and protests. In the 90s, \\"the years of institutionalisation\\", as she calls them, have started: Tekeli focused on creating associations and foundations. ===Years of action=== Following Turkey‚Äôs decision on not changing the civic law in accordance with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women(CEDAW), in 1986 she took part in a petition demanding changes in the constitution, laws and practice, in accordance with the contract. On 17 May 1987, she participated to the first legal protest after the military coup, and demanded an end to domestic violence. In 1989 she took part in the Mor ƒ∞ƒüne (Purple Needle) campaign, creating awareness against sexual abuse, In the 1980s she also got involved with various campaigns against murder of divorced women. ===Years of institutionalisation=== To make the fruits of the actions taken in 1980s sustainable, she took part in the creation of the following foundations and associations: * Insan Haklari Dernegi (The Human Rights Association) - 1986 * Helsinki Yurtta≈ülar Derneƒüi (Helsinki Citizens' Assembly) - 1989 * Mor √áatƒ± Kadƒ±n Sƒ±ƒüƒ±naƒüƒ± Vakfi, (Purple Roof Women's Shelter Foundation) - 1990 * Kadƒ±n Eserleri K√ºt√ºphanesi ve Bilgi Merkezi Vakfƒ± ( Women's Works Library and Information Center Foundation) - 1996 * Kadƒ±n Adaylarƒ± Destekleme Derneƒüi (Association for Supporting Women Candidates - 1997 * Anak√ºlt√ºr Kooperatifi (Anak√ºlt√ºr Cooperative) - 1997 * Winpeace ‚Äì Turkish and Greek Women's Peace Initiative - 1997 * ≈ûirin-Ahmet Tekeli Kadƒ±n Hukuk√ßularƒ± Destekleme Vakfƒ± (≈ûirin-Ahmet Tekeli Association for Supporting Women Lawyers) - 2010 ==Selected works== During her years in academia and after her resignation she contributed to Turkish feminist literature. She worked as an author, editor and a translator. The translations she made helped the creation of the Turkish feminist terminology. ===Books=== Turkish * David Easton'un Sistem Teorisine Katkƒ±sƒ± √úzerine Bir ƒ∞nceleme. ƒ∞stanbul 1976 * Kadƒ±nlar ve Siyasal- Toplumsal Hayat. ƒ∞stanbul 1982 * Kadƒ±nlar ƒ∞√ßin. ƒ∞stanbul 1988 * 80'ler T√ºrkiye'sinde Kadƒ±n Bakƒ±≈ü A√ßƒ±sƒ±ndan Kadƒ±nlar. ƒ∞stanbul: ƒ∞leti≈üim 1990, 1995, 2010. * Meryem Koray ile: Devlet-Kadƒ±n-Politika. ƒ∞stanbul: T√úSES, 1991 German * Frauen in der t√ºrkischen Politik, in: Die Frau in der t√ºrkischen Gesellschaft.

The temple construction will be undertaken by Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra. The ground-breaking ceremony was performed on 5 August 2020 by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi. ==History== ===Background=== Rama, considered an incarnation of god Vishnu, is a widely worshiped Hindu deity. According to the ancient Indian epic, Ramayana, Rama was born in Ayodhya. In the 16th century, the Mughals constructed a mosque, the Babri Masjid which is believed to be the site of the Ram Janmabhoomi, the birthplace of Rama. A violent dispute arose in the 1850s. In the 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), belonging to the Hindu nationalist family Sangh Parivar, launched a new movement to reclaim the site for Hindus and to erect a temple dedicated to the infant Rama (Ram Lalla) at this spot. In November 1989, the VHP laid the foundations of a temple on land adjacent to the disputed mosque. On 6 December 1992, the VHP and the Bharatiya Janata Party organised a rally at the site involving 150,000 volunteers, known as kar sevaks. The rally turned violent, and the crowd overwhelmed the security forces and tore down the mosque. The demolition resulted in several months of intercommunal rioting between India's Hindu and Muslim communities, causing the death of at least 2,000 people, and triggering riots all over the Indian subcontinent. A 1978 and a 2003 archaeological excavation by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) found evidence indicating that Hindu temple remains had existed on the site.Archeologist KK Muhammad accused several historians of undermining the findings. Over the years, various title and legal disputes also took place, such as the passage of the Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Ordinance, 1993. It was only after the 2019 Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya dispute that it was decided the disputed land be handed over to a trust formed by the Indian government for the construction of a Ram temple. The trust was eventually formed under the name Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra. Five acres of land was allocated for the mosque elsewhere in the city. On 5 February 2020, it was announced in the Parliament that the Narendra Modi government had accepted a scheme to construct the temple. ===Prior construction efforts=== In the 1980s, the VHP collected funds and bricks with \\"Shree Ram\\" written on them. Later, the Rajiv Gandhi government gave the VHP permission for Shilanyas, with the then Home Minister Buta Singh formally conveying the permission to the VHP leader Ashok Singhal. Initially the centre and state governments had agreed upon the conducting of the Shilanyas outside of the disputed site. However, on 9 November 1989, a group of VHP leaders and Sadhus laid the foundation stone by digging a pit adjacent to the disputed land. The singhdwar () of the sanctum was laid here. Kameshwar Chaupal (a Dalit leader from Bihar) became one of the first people to lay the stone. == Architecture == The original design for the Ram temple was prepared in 1988 by the Sompura family of Ahmedabad. The Sompuras have been part of the temple design of over 100 temples all over the world for at least 15 generations. The chief architect of the temple is Chandrakant Sompura. He was assisted by his two sons Nikhil Sompura and Ashish Sompura, who are also architects. A new design, with some changes from the original, was prepared by the Sompuras in 2020, in accordance with Vastu shastra and the Shilpa shastras. The temple will be 235 feet wide, 360 feet long and 161 feet high. Once complete, the temple complex will be the world's third largest Hindu shrine. It is designed in the Nagara style of Indian temple architecture. A model of the proposed temple was showcased during the Prayag Kumbh Mela in 2019. The main structure of the temple will be built on a raised platform and will have three storeys. It will have five mandapas in the middle of the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) and the entry, the three mandapas Kudu, Nritya, and Rang in the same order and two mandapas for the Kirtan and Prarthana will be on the one or the other side. In Nagara style, the mandapas are to be decorated with shikhara. The tallest Shikhara will be that above the Garbhagriha. A total of 366 columns with 160 on the ground floor, 132 on first floor, 74 on second floor will be in the building structure. The columns will have 16 idols each to include all the incarnations of Shiva, the Dashavataras, the chausath joginis, and the 12 incarnations of the goddess Saraswati. The width of the stairs will be 16 feet. In accordance with scriptures dedicated to the design of temples dedicated to Vishnu, the sanctum sanctorum will be octagonal. The temple will be built in 10 acres and 57 acres of land will be developed into a complex with a prayer hall, \\"a Ramkatha Kunj (lecture hall), a Vaidik Pathshala (educational facility), a Sant Niwas (saints' residence) and a Yatri Niwas (hostel for visitors)\\" and other facilities like a museum and a cafeteria. == Construction == The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust began the first phase of construction of the Ram Temple in March 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in India followed by the 2020 China‚ÄìIndia skirmishes caused a temporary suspension of the construction. During ground-leveling and excavation of the construction site a Shivaling, pillars and broken idols were found. On 25 March 2020, Ram's idol was moved to a temporary location in the presence of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. In preparation for its construction, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad organised a Vijay Mahamantra Jaap Anushthan, in which individuals would gather at different places to chant the Vijay Mahamantra, Shri Ram, Jai Ram, Jai Jai Ram, on 6 April 2020. This was said to ensure \\"victory over hurdles\\" in the construction of the temple. Larsen & Toubro offered to oversee the design and construction of the temple free of cost and is the contractor of the project. The construction work will be accomplished with 600 thousand cubic feet of sandstone Bansi mountain stones from Rajasthan. Thirty years ago, more than two hundred thousand bricks etched with the 'Sri Rama' in several languages had arrived from various parts of the country will be utilized in the foundation. Engineers have collected the soil samples for testing at the site. Primeval and customary techniques will create the shrine. The shrine will be strong enough to sustain earthquakes, storms, and other natural calamities. There will be no use of iron in the construction of the temple. The fusing of the stone blocks will require ten thousand copper plates. === Ground-breaking ceremony === The temple construction officially started again after a ground- breaking ceremony on 5 August 2020. Three-day long Vedic rituals were held ahead of the ground-breaking ceremony, which revolved around the installation of a 40 kg silver brick as the foundation stone by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi. On 4 August, the Ramarchan Puja was performed, an invitation to all the major gods and goddesses. On the occasion of the Bhoomi- Pooja, soil and holy-water from several religious places across India, Triveni Sangam of rivers Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati at Prayagraj, Kaveri river at Talakaveri, Kamakhya Temple in Assam and many others, were collected. Soil was also sent from various Hindu temples, Gurudwaras and Jain Temples across the nation to bless the upcoming temple. Among the many was Sharada Peeth located in Pakistan. Soil was also sent form the four pilgrimage locations of Char Dham. Temples in United States, Canada and Caribbean Islands held a virtual service to celebrate the occasion. Rama's image were shown at Times Square. All 7,000 temples in a 7 km radius of Hanumangarhi were also been asked to join in the celebrations by lighting diyas. Muslims devotees in Ayodhya who consider Rama as their ancestor also looked forward to the bhoomi-puja. Spiritual leaders from all faiths were invited on the occasion. On 5 August, Prime Minister Modi first offered prayers at Hanumangarhi temple to seek blessings of Hanuman for the day's events. Following this the ground breaking and foundation stone laying ceremony of Ram Mandir took place. Yogi Adityanath, Mohan Bhagwat, Nritya Gopal Das and Narendra Modi gave speeches. Modi started his speech with Jai Siya Ram and he went on to urge those in attendance to chant Jai Siya Ram. He stated, \\"the call of Jai Siya Ram is resonating not only in the city of Lord Ram but throughout the world today\\" and that \\"Ram Mandir will become the modern symbol of our traditions\\". Narendra Modi also paid his respects to the many who had made sacrifices for the Ram temple. Mohan Bhagwat also thanked L. K. Advani for his contributions to the movement to get the temple built. Modi also planted a sapling of the Parijat. In front of the deity, Modi performed a dandvat pranam/ sashtang pranam, lying completely prone on the ground with hands outstretched in prayer. Orthodox priests and religious leaders complained that the ceremony did not follow proper ritual procedures, pointing out, among others, that 5 August was not a ritually auspicious date and that the function did not include a havan. In this respect, writer Arundhati Roy pointed out that the chosen date marked one year since the revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, arguing that the decision to schedule the ceremony for 5 August, an inauspicious date with no significance in the Hindu calendar, symbolized the conclusion of a period \\"in which India under Modi has formally declared itself a Hindu Nation, the dawning of a new era.\\" Various political leaders hailed the ground-breaking ceremony. While some openly celebrated it, others worded their statements carefully. Many expressed hope in furthering the country's progress by following the ideals of Ram. Soon after the ground- breaking ceremony, residents of Ayodhya expressed hope in improvements of job opportunities and development of the city, through tourism generated by the temple. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, attendees at the temple were limited to 175.

Ram Lalla was a litigant in the court case over the disputed site since 1989, being considered a \\"juristic person\\" by the law. He was represented by Triloki Nath Pandey, a senior VHP leader who was considered as Ram Lalla's next 'human' friend. ==See also== * Conversion of non-Muslim places of worship into mosques * Conversion of mosques into non-Islamic places of worship * List of Hindu temples in India == Explanatory footnotes == ==References== == External links == * Category:Ayodhya dispute Category:Hindu temples in Uttar Pradesh Category:Proposed religious places Category:Rama temples ","title":"Ram Mandir, Ayodhya"},{"id":"63897438","text":"R.

It is a Grade II listed building. ==History== The building was commissioned to replace the aging vestry hall of St Paul's. The site selected had previously been occupied by a row of residential properties with public baths behind. The new building was designed by Henry Vaughan Lanchester, James Stewart and Edwin Alfred Rickards in the Baroque style and built by Holloway Brothers; it was officially opened by the mayor, Councillor Joseph Pyne, on 19 July 1905. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with seven bays facing onto New Cross Road; the central section featured a round arched doorway flanked by figures of Tritons as corbels on the ground floor; there was an oriel window on the first floor with a carved relief of a ship's prow and a pediment containing a tympanum depicting a naval battle above that. Statues of four naval figures, Sir Francis Drake, Robert Blake, Horatio Nelson and an unnamed contemporary admiral, were designed by Henry Poole, and erected on the front of the building at first floor level. A clock tower with a weather vane in the shape of a galleon was erected at roof level. Internally, the principal rooms were the council chamber and the mayor's chamber on the first floor. During the First World War, the town hall was infamous for holding all its trials of conscientious objectors in secret. This controversial practice was more recently explored in the film, Devils on Horseback, released in 2018. In the bombing of the Second World War, a V-2 rocket destroyed a Woolworths store on the opposite side of the street killing 160 people in the shop with the blast superficially damaging the town hall itself. The building was established as the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford but ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged London Borough of Lewisham was formed in 1965. It was used as a workspace for some council departments until it was acquired by Goldsmiths College in 2000. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Lewisham Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1905 Category:Grade II listed government buildings Category:1905 establishments in England ","title":"Deptford Town Hall"},{"id":"63897500","text":"Eupeodes nitens is a Palearctic hoverfly. ==Description== Resembles other Eupeodes.

Actors in the movie included Gilbert Sarony, a well-known cross-dressing performer. The film was inspired by Wallace McCutcheon's 1904 film Personal.Review, synopsis and link to watch the film: ==Plot== The film starts with a title reading 'A remake of \\"Personal\\" in which a man advertises in the newspaper for a wife, asking interested parties to \\"meet me at the fountain\\"'. It is followed by a middle close-up of the man drafting the advertisement, a middle shot of the man posting it, and again a middle close-up of the man getting ready in front of a mirror. This is followed by a full shot of the man waiting at the meeting point in front of a fountain. First comes a nanny, pushing a baby stroller. He bows low and wants to kiss the baby but she pushes him away. Meet Me at the Fountain: streetcar shot A number of women arrive, he begins to greet them but when they become too insistent, he runs away, chased by the group of women. He catches a streetcar, jumps over a fence, runs up a flight of stairs, climbs up a tree, then a wall but they keep following him. He finally falls into a river where one of the ladies follows him and helps him get out of the water, she is the winner. The film ends with a medium close-up of the bride and bridegroom all dressed up, which reveals that the bride is actually a man dressed as a woman. The two men French kiss. ==Production and analysis== This is the third film shot in the United States in 1904 showing a man placing an advertisement in order to get married and ending up being chased by a group of women. The first was Personal, directed by Wallace McCutcheon Sr., for the Biograph Company and the second How a French Nobleman Got a Wife through the New York Herald ‚ÄòPersonal‚Äô Column directed by Edwin S. Porter for the Edison Manufacturing Company. Meet Me at the Fountain: Bride and bridegroom Siegmund Lubin, who was trained as an optometrist and had built his own camera and projector combination started in 1896 distributing films notably from Thomas Edison in Philadelphia. From 1897 he started making films and in 1902 formed the Lubin Manufacturing Company. This film is mostly composed of outdoors wide shots and includes at the beginning and at the end medium close-ups shot indoors. While the film is presented as a remake of Personal, it includes a greater variety of shots and more importantly presents an unprecedented twist at the end with the shot revealing that the bride is a man, which makes it the first transgender film.

Booker-Bryant was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1923 and lived in Kentucky before dying in 2013. She was known for her activism and work in civil rights, fair housing, and the fight for better housing conditions in Louisville. Booker-Bryant received many awards in her life, including the Carl and Anne Braden lifetime achievement award in 2011 and was also inducted into the Kentucky Civil Rights Hall of Fame. Booker-Bryant was also a buddhist member of the Soka Gakkai International. She was married to Louisville civil rights activist, Roscoe C. Bryant Jr. who fought and became the first African-American physician on the Louisville and Jefferson County Board of Health. == Personal life == Booker- Bryant was born to William and Fannie Booker of Detroit, Michigan in 1923. She was raised and spent her life in the west end of Louisville, Kentucky which is a predominantly black and low-income neighborhood in the city. This upbringing showed her how African-Americans during the depression and civil rights movement lived. This led to her urge to want a better tomorrow for her people and community. With this passion for equality she participated in many different causes to work for a better future for African Americans in Kentucky and especially Louisville, her home city. == Civil Rights work == Ruth Booker- Bryant fought hard for causes fighting for social and human rights. Throughout her career as a civil rights activist she was a part of multiple organizations and demonstrations fighting for better housing for Kentucky African Americans. Her first major role was being a VISTA coordinator for the West End Community Council from 1964-66. The West End Community Council was a human rights group active from the mid-1940s till the early 1970s that fought for equal housing in Louisville‚Äôs west end, The women on this council faced scare tactics from white residents in Louisville who opposed what the council was fighting for. After this endeavor, she moved on to help found and become president of the Women United for Social Action. Also in 1968, she founded the Black Unity League in Kentucky to help empower African Americans to take action in the state of Kentucky. With the help of other civil rights leaders at the time Louisville eventually desegregated. Without catalysts like Ruth Booker-Bryant dedicating their whole lives to this cause, the fight might have taken longer or not happened. == Accolades == With activism, recognition is not what Booker-Bryant was fighting for. She was fighting for equality and peace for African Americans and that started at home in Louisville, Kentucky. However her hard work and dedication to the fight for housing equality led for her to be inducted in to the Kentucky Civil Rights Hall of Fame in 2003. Her bio mentions how she dedicated her life to the fight for better housing and how she participated in a number of demonstrations throughout her career. She also received the Carl and Anne Braden Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011, for her lifetime of activism in the Louisville Civil Rights Movement. == Family == Booker-Bryant was proceeded in death by her husband Roscoe Bryant in October 2005.

Symptoms typically consist of diarrhea, abdominal pain and rectal bleeding. Less commonly, nausea and vomiting may occur, which may suggest the present of gastroenteritis. The severity of diarrhea and colitis are graded based on the frequency of bowel movements and symptoms of colitis, respectively. The gold standard for the diagnosis of checkpoint inhibitor induced colitis is colonoscopy with evaluation of the terminal ileum. However, in most cases, a flexible sigmoidoscopy is sufficient. Infection should be ruled out with stool studies, including Clostridioides difficile, bacterial culture, ova and parasites. Symptoms of upper abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting warrant evaluation with upper endoscopy. Treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis is based on severity, as defined by the grade of diarrhea and colitis. Mild cases by managed with temporary interruption of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, dietary modification (low residue), and/or loperamide. More severe cases require immune suppression with corticosteroid therapy. If steroids are ineffective, infliximab may be considered. If colitis fails to improve with infliximab, then vedolizumab may be effective. ==Epidemiology== The prevalence of checkpoint inhibitor induced colitis varies depending on the regimen of immunotherapy. The incidence is 0.7 ‚Äì 1.6% for anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) agents, 5.7 ‚Äì 9.1% for anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), and about 13.6% for combination therapy. The risk associated with ipilimumab is dose dependent, such that higher doses are associated with higher rates of colitis. However, other agents (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) are not associated with a dose dependent effect on the risk of immune mediated colitis. Risk factors for immune mediated colitis include Caucasian race, treatment with an anti-CTLA4 based regimen, melanoma as cancer type, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, and a prior history of checkpoint inhibitor induced colitis. ==Pathophysiology== Immune checkpoints are important for the normal development of T regulatory cells (Tregs) in the intestine. Mice with the CTLA-4 gene removed (eg CTLA-4 knockout) develop severe autoimmune disease, with diffuse infiltration of T cells in multiple organs and fatal enterocolitis. Immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis is typically characterized by either diffuse mucosal inflammation or focal active colitis with patchy crypt abscesses. Common findings of acute colitis include: intraepithelial neutrophilic infiltrates, crypt abscesses, and increased apoptotic cells within crypts. However, the histologic appearance varies, and evidence of chronic inflammation is seen in some cases, including intraepithelial lymphocytes or basal lymphocytes and crypt architecture distortion. Histologic inflammation may occur as early as 1-2 weeks after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, well before the onset of symptoms. Anti-PD-1 induced colitis may lead to more CD8+ T cell inflammation, whereas Anti-CTLA4 induced colitis may involve more CD4+ T cell infiltration and higher mucosal levels of the inflammatory molecule TNF alpha. Amongst people treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, those with Faecalibacterium genus and other Firmicutes present in the colonic flora have longer progression-free survival and overall survival. In addition, a higher rate of checkpoint inhibitor induced colitis is associated with the presence of Faecalibacterium in the fecal microbiota. ==Signs and symptoms== The most common symptom is diarrhea, which occurs in 92 percent of cases, followed by abdominal pain (82%) and rectal bleeding (64%). About 46% of cases include fever and 36% involve nausea and vomiting. Less often, nausea and vomiting may be present. Weight loss has been reported. Onset of diarrhea generally occurs about 6‚Äì7 weeks after starting immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. ===Grading colitis and diarrhea=== The extent of diarrhea is graded based on severity, from 1 to 5. Grade 1 diarrhea is defined by an increase in the number of stools below four per day (compared with baseline). Grade 2 diarrhea is defined by an increase of 4‚Äì6 bowel movements per day. Grade 3 diarrhea is defined by an increase by 7 or more bowel movements per day. Grade 4 diarrhea involves life-threatening consequences, such as shock, whereas grade 5 results in death. The extent of colitis is also graded based on severity, from 1 to 5. Grade 1 colitis does not result in any symptoms, while grade 2 colitis leads to abdominal pain, mucous and blood in the stools. Grade 3 colitis is defined by severe pain, peritoneal signs and ileus. Grade 4 colitis is defined by life-threatening consequences, including perforation, ischemia, necrosis, bleeding, or toxic megacolon. Grade 5 colitis results in death. ==Diagnosis== Colonoscopy with evaluation of the terminal ileum is the gold standard in the diagnosis of checkpoint inhibitor induced colitis. However, in most cases, a limited evaluation of the distal colon with flexible sigmoidoscopy is sufficient. Endoscopic findings may include loss of vascular pattern, erythema, edema, erosions, ulcers, exudates, granularity, and bleeding. Biopsies should be taken even in endoscopic findings are normal, as inflammation may not be immediately apparent and may only be seen on histology (microscopic colitis). Symptoms of nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain may suggest involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract. If present, evaluation with upper endoscopy is warranted. There are no stool tests or blood tests specific for checkpoint inhibitor induced colitis. However, diagnostic evaluation should include ruling out infectious causes for diarrhea and colitis. Stool studies should include: Clostridioides difficile toxin, bacterial culture, ova and parasites. Testing for CMV infection should be considered. Fecal calprotectin may be helpful, and is very sensitive and specific for inflammation in the intestines. Elevations in fecal calprotectin correlate with the extent of intestinal inflammation. Computed tomography (CT) imaging may show evidence of colitis, though the sensitivity is relatively low (50%). Free air in the peritoneum indicates bowel perforation. Abdominal imaging may be necessary to rule out toxic megacolon or perforation. Though rare, gastrointestinal metastases (rare) should be considered as a cause of symptoms. ==Treatment== Treatment varies depending on the severity of disease. For mild disease, supportive care may be sufficient, including loperamide and a low residue or bland diet. For more severe disease, the immune checkpoint inhibitor should be discontinued. Corticosteroid therapy is used to decrease inflammation, at a dose of roughly prednisone 1‚Äì2 mg per kg of body weight per day. In cases that do not respond to corticosteroid therapy, infliximab may be used. For cases that fail to respond to infliximab, or where infliximab is contraindicated, vedolizumab may be used. Overall, response rates from treatment are 59% for corticosteroids, 81% for infliximab, and 85% for vedolizumab. Surgery with resection of the colon (colectomy) is necessary in some instances, particularly if severe complications occur, such as perforation or toxic megacolon. Fecal calprotectin, a stool test and marker of inflammation, may be used to follow improvement in colitis. ==Complications== High grade colitis may lead to severe complications, including perforation, toxic megacolon and death. Bleeding may occur due to colitis. Treatment with corticosteroids may lead to infectious complications, including: urinary tract infections, C. difficile infection, and pneumonia. == See also== * Immunotherapy == References == Category:Gastroenterology Category:Cancer immunotherapy ","title":"Checkpoint inhibitor induced colitis"},{"id":"63897781","text":"Evaluation and Program Planning is a bimonthly peer-reviewed multidisciplinary social science journal covering program evaluation.

He began his career at the University of Michigan Law School before moving to Lexington to begin his law career. Chiles argued in the United States Supreme Court case Chiles v. Chesapeake & O R CO after being moved from a section of the train reserved from whites only into the colored section, despite having a first class ticket. The case was ultimately dismissed upholding the legality of the Kentucky Separate Coach Law. == Early life == James Alexander Chiles was born in Richmond, Virginia in 1860. He was one of eight children born to Richard and Martha Chiles. He had a twin brother, named John, who gave him financial assistance while at Lincoln University and University of Michigan Law School. He began his education at the age of 6 at the Freedmens‚Äô School in Richmond Virginia but due to his parents being poor and having a large family to provide for, he and his brothers felt as though they should leave school and work to help provide for the home; which they did. He held various jobs, he first started out working at the tobacco factory, then he got offered a job as a porter in a store, and finally worked at a hotel as a bellboy and a porter. With whatever spare time he got from work, he would utilize his time to study and read to prepare to continue his education one day. == Education == With financial support from his twin brother John, he enrolled at Lincoln University in Chester Co, Pennsylvania in 1882 where he also worked for his board as a dining room waiter. He graduated in 1887 and enrolled at the University of Michigan Law school. While in law school he was noted as being an example of industry and good conduct as well as a diligent pupil. By 1889 he had acquired his law degree and began practicing law in Virginia. This was short lived as the following year he moved to Lexington, Kentucky and established his own law firm there. == Legal practice == Chiles was the first African American lawyer to practice law in Lexington, Kentucky beginning in 1890. By 1907, Chiles was one of four African American Lawyers in Lexington total. He opened a law firm at 304 W. Short Street. ==Chiles v. Chesapeake & O R CO== In 1903, Chiles purchased a first class ticket from Washington D.C. to Lexington, Kentucky on the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. The train did not run all the way from Washington, D.C. to Lexington, first stopping in Ashland, Kentucky. It is here where Chiles entered a car reserved only for whites only. He was asked by the brakesman to go into the colored department of the train, which he declined to do. The conductor then asked Chiles to seat himself in the colored section of the train in accordance with the regulations of the O R CO. He refused on the grounds that he had bought a first class ticket from Washington, D.C to Lexington. He was then forcibly escorted to the colored train car, leading Chiles to challenge this decision as a violation of his Constitutional rights. The ‚Äúcolored‚Äù car was established by Kentucky‚Äôs Separate Coach Law, which stated that black and white train passengers were to ride in separate train cars in 1892.Marshall, Anne E. \\"Kentucky's Separate Coach Law and African American Response, 1892-1900.\\" The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society 98, no. 3 (2000): 241-59. Accessed May 8, 2020. www.jstor.org/stable/23384055. Chiles had claimed that the Separate Coach Law did not apply to him and his interstate commerce laws were being violated. Taking his case to the Circuit Court of Fayette County, Kentucky, Chiles lost his case and was granted no compensation. It was determined that because of Ashland to Lexington, the state could uphold the Separate Coach Law determining that the cars were equal for both black and white passengers with the same conveniences being provided in each and that Chiles must obey the rules and regulations of the railroad company. He requested a new trial, which was denied. In 1907, Chiles appealed the decision taking it to the Kentucky Court of Appeals and won damages to the amount of $100 because of his seat being moved from first class into the unequal colored train car, escorted by a police officer after protest. Chiles decided to again challenge the decision he was granted claiming violation of separate but equal laws, claiming he was forced to move to an unequal Jim Crow car. Chiles protested that class, not race, should be the determining factor in the law as he had the economic capacity to ride in first class and purchased himself a ticket. Chiles then took the case to the United States Supreme Court where the case was argued April 18, 1910. On May 10, 1910, the Supreme Court upheld the Kentucky Court of Appeals decision arguing that a state railroad company has the right to establish regulations which required white and black passengers to reside in separate train cars. == Personal life == Chiles was an active member of the African American community. He and his wife were known to be helping the poor and needy. Chiles resisted the Kentucky General Assembly when they discussed passing a bill that discriminated against African American voters in 1904. Chiles lobbied for school truant officers and physicians in African American schools in Lexington Kentucky. In 1913, Chiles was appointed as a delegate to the 50th anniversary observance of the Emancipation Proclamation in Philadelphia by Kentucky Governor James McCreary. == Death and legacy == Chiles died in Richmond, Virginia in April of 1930. After Chiles' death, the Lexington Bar Association wrote a tribute in his memory. The tribute was listed in the Lexington Leader newspaper on April 9th 1930 and reads, ‚ÄúProverbs 22:29 reads, ‚ÄúDo you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand in the presence of kings.

He played U Sports football for the Montreal Carabins. ==Early life and high school== Dequoy grew up in Montreal on √éle-Bizard and began playing organized football at the age of five. He played many positions in youth clubs but mainly safety. He attended C√©gep Andr√©-Laurendeau in 2012 but did not play football, citing a lack of passion. The following year, he transferred to Montmorency College and played five games after trying out for the team. He did not play in 2014 due to a broken left collarbone. In 2015, Dequoy also did not play due to being ruled ineligibile. ==College career== Dequoy enrolled at the University of Montreal and moved up the depth chart on the Carabins football team in 2016. He mainly played on special teams and had 9.5 tackles while appearing in five games.

The circumstances of her death are unclear. == Background == === The political climate === The violent political climate which characterized Italy in the 1970s was greatly noticeable in Rome. On February 17, 1977, clashes erupted at Sapienza University, when the student movement (including members of Indiani Metropolitani and Autonomia Operaia) violently opposed a speech by CGIL (Italian General Confederation of Labour) secretary Luciano Lama. On March 12, 1977, during a widely attended protest march, gunfight between police officers and demonstrators was narrowly averted. On April 21, 1977, autonomist students tried once again to occupy Sapienza University. When police came to clear them, they responded with Molotov cocktails and gunfire. In the confrontation that followed, police officer Settimio Passamonti was killed and three other officers were injured. The following day, Minister of the Interior Francesco Cossiga announced a city-wide ban on all public demonstrations, which lasted until the end of the month. === The victim === Born on August 6, 1958, Giorgiana Masi lived with her parents and older sister on Via Trionfale, Roma, near the San Filippo Neri hospital. In 1977, she was attending her fifth and last year of Liceo scientifico \\"L. Pasteur.\\" A member of the Radical Party and feminist activist, Masi was attending the radical sit-in together with boyfriend Gianfranco Papini on May 12, 1977, when she was killed. == Incident == Plaque in memory of Giorgiana Masi on the Ponte Garibaldi in Rome. On May 12, 1977, the Radical Party and the far-left organization Lotta Continua held a sit-in in Piazza Navona, Rome. The demonstration aimed at protesting against recent measures banning public manifestations, celebrating the third anniversary since the divorce referendum, and collecting signatures supporting the upcoming referendums on party financing and public order. Activists were joined by students from the Movement of 1977 and members of Autonomia Operaia, some of which were armed. About 5,000 law enforcement agents gathered, as well, supported by plainclothes officers hidden through the protesters' ranks. Several incidents broke out during the afternoon. Around 2:00 p.m., Piazza Navona was closed to traffic by police and incendiary bombs, tear gas and gunshots were fired. By 7:00 p.m., mediation efforts by some members of Parliament appeared to have made a safe evacuation of the demonstrators possible, towards the rione of Trastevere through Garibaldi Bridge. As the evacuation began, incidents got more serious. Gunshots and smoke bombs were fired. Police were lined up on the northern part of the bridge, on the side of Via Arenula, while protesters were running away southwards, toward Piazza Belli. At 7:55 p.m., in the turmoil, bystanders saw Giorgiana Masi fall to the ground as if tripping over and being put in a car, which took her to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. She had been shot in the back with a .22 caliber gun. Though her assailant is unknown to this day, Marco Pannella and his Radical Party reported, on several occasions, accusations against the Minister of the Interior, Francesco Cossiga, as the moral responsibility of Masi's death, stressing the presence of armed undercover agents among the protesters. Cossiga sent the accusation back to Pannella, supposedly guilty of holding the demonstration despite the well-known related risks. == References == Category:1977 in Italy Category:1977 in politics Category:1977 deaths Category:Deaths by firearm in Italy Category:Deaths related to the Years of Lead (Italy) Category:Italian activists Category:Italian murder victims Category:People murdered in Italy ","title":"Death of Giorgiana Masi"},{"id":"63897868","text":"California Proposition 68 (also the Natural Resources Bond or the California Drought, Water, Parks, Climate, Coastal Protection, and Outdoor Access for All Act of 2018) was a legislatively referred constitutional amendment that appeared on ballots in California in the June primary election in 2018. It was a $4.1bn bond measure to fund parks, environmental projects, water infrastructure projects and flood protection measures throughout California. ==Proposal== The Proposition would allow the State of California to borrow $4.1bn using a municipal bond scheme in order to fund parks, water and flood protection infrastructure and various environmental projects. The Proposition set allocation of these funds between different strategies: *Natural Resource Conservation and Resiliency - $1.547bn **State conservancies and wildlife conservation - $767m **Climate preparedness and habitat resiliency - $443m **Ocean and coastal protection - $175m **River and waterway improvements - $162m *Parks and recreation - $1.283bn **Parks in neighbourhoods with few parks - $725m **Local and regional parks - $285m **State park restoration, preservation and protection - $218m **Trails, greenways, and rural recreation - $55m *Water - $1.27bn **Flood protection - $550m **Groundwater recharge and cleanup - $370m **Safe drinking water - $250m **Water recycling - $100m The cost to the public was estimated to be $7.8bn after paying off interest, or an average annual repayment of $200m for forty years. ==Campaign== === Support === Proposition 68 was authored by State Senator Kevin de Le√≥n. The 'Yes' campaign focused mainly on the improvements the Proposition would bring to parks, saying that it would remedy years of \\"under-investment\\" in environmental infrastructure in poorer communities. 'Yes' supporters spent more than $9m throughout the campaign.

It was also noted that although the 'Yes' campaign was promoting the Proposition on its benefits to parks, less than one third of the money would actually go towards parks and recreation.

He is currently a candidate for sainthood, which would make him the first person from Brooklyn to be made a canonized Saint by the Roman Catholic Church. ==Biography== Bernard J. Quinn was born in Newark, New Jersey, to poor Irish immigrants, Bernard and Sarah Quinn. He entered St. John's Seminary in 1906. He was ordained on June 12, 1912 and was temporarily assigned to several different churches. He served as a chaplain in the 333rd Machine Gun Infantry Regiment during World War I, and he was gassed in France. Following the war, he resumed his pastoral duties in Brooklyn. In 1922, Quinn established the first church for Black Catholics in Brooklyn, which he had consecrated to St. Peter Claver, which is still in operation and counts among its graduates of its parochial school the civil rights activist and singer Lena Horne. In 1928, he established the diocese's first orphanage for black children Wading River. His humanitarian work was met with opposition with some groups and individuals. In 1929, Monsignor John L. Belford had written openly in his newsletter against the growing number of African-Americans in the Catholic Church, which was met with strong disagreement from Quinn. Quinn responded, \\"No church can exclude anyone and still keep its Christian ideals.\\" The Little Flower House of Providence was burned twice in one year by the Ku Klux Klan, which prompted Quinn to rebuild once again but this time out of more fireproof material, according to a 1929 article in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle with the headline: ‚ÄúNew Fireproof Orphanage Will Defy Incendiary.‚Äù The Little Flower House of Providence has become the base of operations for the Little Flower Children and Family Services of New York, which continues to provide services such as care for adults with developmental disabilities, for those in Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island. Quinn included music as part of his ministry. Hundreds of black children joined the church choir, including singers Lena Horne and Pearl Bailey. In April 1940, he was admitted to St. Mary's Hospital for surgery to treat an abdominal problem.

Tep Im was raised by his mother to be a Catholic, and at the young age began to be sent to various schools abroad, such as in Vietnam, France, and Italy. After his ordination at the Notre-Dame de Paris, Tep Im took further theological studies in Rome. However, growing concerns for his country's problems as well as a decisive conversation with American bishop Fulton Sheen would lead him to decide against a monastic life and return to Cambodia by August 1962. Upon the establishment of the Apostolic Prefecture of Battambang, Tep Im was installed as its apostolic prefect on September 26, 1968, a position he remained in up to his death under the Khmer Rouge regime in early May 1975. Tep Im has been described by historian Milton Osborne as a priest with remarkable understanding of both the Catholic faith and Cambodian society.

Some of her papers are held in the Department of Special Collections and University Archives at Stanford University.http://pdf.oac.cdlib.org/pdf/stanford/mss/m2476.pdf ==Personal life== Woodrew was married to Richard E. \\"Dick\\" Smolowe. They had four children together, Allan, Jonathan, Jill, and Ann. Woodrew was the granddaughter of Alexander Schlang and Blanche Cohen-Schlang-Nirenstein, the latter of whom was deeply involved in social and charity work in New York. Woodrew was the great-granddaughter of David and Wilhemina Cohen, the former of whom was a founder and funder of the Eldridge Street Synagogue in New York City. ==Education== Woodrew attended the University of Florida, graduating with honors and a B.A. in 1951.

In her 1981 book On A Slide of Light, she described her encounters as taking place initially \\"under laboratory conditions with a leading medical doctor and scientist.\\" It was her \\"impression that once [she] left the lab, [she] would also leave [the extraterrrestrial intelligences] behind, but this was not to be the case. Once [she] exercised [her] free will in allowing extraterrestrials into [her] life, they quickly became a regular part of [her] experienced reality.

The experiments the two supposedly undertook, leading to Woodrew's alien contacts, took place at what Puharich called Lab Nine on his estate in Ossining, New York. During her lifetime, Woodrew also had contact with author and psychical researcher Harold Morrow Sherman; she and husband Dick Smolowe visited Sherman at least once at his home, Ark Haven, in Arkansas.https://haroldsherman.com/chronology/ ==Alleged healing abilities== Woodrew claimed to be a healer, with extraterrestrials' healing abilities channeled through her. One such instance of supposed healing was for ballerina Virginia Rich Barnett for whom Woodrew, \\"in minutes, cured [...] of a knee injury so severe doctors told her she would never even exercise again, let alone dance.\\"https://www.antiqbook.com/books/bookinfo.phtml?nr=1485437424&l;=nl&seller;= ==The Woodrew Update== Woodrew and husband Dick Smolowe began their newsletter, The Woodrew Update,http://www.ignaciodarnaude.com/ufologia/Contactee%20lists-3.pdf in 1980. They continued publishing it until 1997. The publication was national and international, with subscribers from across the United States, Canada, and 14 other countries. ==Legacy== The University of Florida offers the Dr. Greta Andron Smolowe Scholarship; she also holds a place in the university's Hall of Fame as First Lady of Student Body Dramatics, Service and Leadership. In addition, the American Biographical Institute honored her for International Contribution to the World of Psi.

While working in a detention camp near the majority Serb settlements of ƒåardak near Derventa, Ba≈°iƒá beat, tortured and subjected Serb civilian prisoners to particular cruelty and killed one prisoner by stabbing him in the neck. Ba≈°iƒá came to the U.S. in 1994 but was eventually extradited to Bosnia in 2011. In 2017, she was found guilty of crimes against the detainees and sentenced to 14 years in prison. ==Profile== Azra Ba≈°iƒá (n√©e Ale≈°eviƒá) was born on 22 June 1959 in Rijeka, Croatia, Yugoslavia. During the war, Ba≈°iƒá fought with the Bosnian Croat (HVO) army. From April 1992 to August 1992, Ba≈°iƒá worked as a guard in three detention camps near the majority Serb settlements of ƒåardak near Derventa. Bosnian state prosecutors charged Ba≈°iƒá with torturing and murdering Serb civilian prisoners at the camps from April to June 1992. According to court documents, she married Nedzad Ba≈°ic on 1 March 1994, in Bosnia and Herzegovina. She went by her maiden and married names, as well as the names Azra Kovaƒçeviƒá and Issabell Ba≈°iƒá. She came to the United States as a refugee in 1994, eventually settling in Kentucky and becoming a naturalized citizen. She took jobs bathing elderly nursing home patients and worked at a Nestl√© food plant in the small rural town of Mount Sterling, where locals knew her as \\"Issabella\\". Ba≈°iƒá was charged in 1993 but was not located by Interpol until 2004. The Bosnian government issued a formal extradition request to the United States in 2007. The U.S. government requested more evidence, which the prosecutors provided in February and April 2010, before arresting her in 2011. She was prosecuted for immigration fraud before being extradited to Bosnia to stand trial in 2016. ==Crimes== According to testimonies, on April 26, 1992, Croat groups, with the assistance of Croatian military units, entered the village of ƒåardak and took dozens of local Serbs hostage. Although the settlement was majority Serb, Croat and Muslims had previously formed joint units and threatened to kill and expel the Serb population. Many were taken to a former Yugoslavian National Army (YNA) Centre. Prisoners at the facility were subjected to torture and beatings. A witness testified that Ba≈°iƒá brought a Croatian flag with a checkerboard coat of arms and ordered prisoners to kiss it and made them eat Yugoslav dinar paper money. She engraved a cross and the letter ‚ÄòS‚Äô on prisoners' backs and foreheads with knives, put salt on their wounds and forced them to lick it. She also punched detainees in their genitals and threatened to circumcise them. One witness said Ba≈°iƒá forced him to drink gasoline and then set his face and hands on fire. Others described how they were made to crawl half naked across broken glass with a knotted rope in their mouths and a Croatian soldier on their backs. In one instance, a prisoner was severely beaten into unconsciousness. It was found that Ba≈°iƒá then killed that same prisoner by stabbing him in the neck and made others drink his blood. Ba≈°iƒá earned the nicknames \\"Azra Two Knives\\" as she always had twin knives strapped to her belt and a boot and \\"Bloody Azra\\" for the cruelty of the crimes. She was known as the \\"mistress of life and death\\". On 27 December 2017, a Bosnian court sentenced her to 14 years in prison for taking part in \\"killing and inhumane treatment, infliction of great pain and violation of bodily integrity and health\\" of detained civilians. It included those who were held at the Yugoslav People's Army Hall in Derventa as well as the nearby village of Polje from April to May 1992. It is the longest sentence handed down to a woman convicted of war crimes during the Bosnian War. ==References== Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:People from Rijeka Category:Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina convicted of war crimes Category:Women in European warfare Category:Women in warfare post-1945 ","title":"Azra Ba≈°iƒá"},{"id":"63898179","text":"John Charles Dias Bandaranaike was a Ceylonese lawyer and legislator.

He was one of the founders of the Remonstrant Brotherhood and a participant to the Synod of Dordrecht. == Biography == Poppius was a son of the pastor Pieter Eduardsz Poppius. He studied theology at Leiden University. After his studies, he became a minister in Amstelveen in 1599. From 1609 to 1619 he was a minister of the Reformed Church of Gouda. He was appointed in Gouda because of his choice for the Arminian ideas of Jacobus Arminius, who rejected the doctrine of double predestination. In 1610, Poppius was one of the signatories of the Remonstrance, in which the followers of Arminius called on the States of Holland to help them in their struggles within the Reformed Church. At the National Synod of Dordrecht in 1618/1619, the views of the Remonstrants were condemned, after which their representatives - including Poppius - were sent out to the meeting. They were exiled from the Republic and brought on farm carts to Waalwijk, which was then under Spanish authority. In 1619, Poppius was one of the founders of the Remonstrant Brotherhood in Antwerp and was appointed one of the six directors of the brotherhood. He nevertheless returned to Gouda and held church services there, both in secret churches and in open air assemblies. In Gouda, the moderate bailiff Schaep was replaced in November 1620 by Anthony Cloots. He fanatically hunted the Remonstrants. Poppius had fear for his arrest after 800 guilders were promised for his arrest. His wife was also denied access to the city. In 1623 he was captured in Haarlem and taken to the Loevestein castle, because of an alleged complicity in plotting an attack on Maurice, Prince of Orange. He died in captivity there the following year. == Bibliography == Eduard Poppius by Pieter Sluyter (1704) * De Enge Poorte, ofte, Predicatien Over eenighe voortreffelijcke Texten, ofte Spreucken der heyligher Schrifture, uitg.

She was also known as Lady Mary Ny Vryen or Lady Mary N√≠ Bhriain, after her mother. She married Brian O'Rourke around 1575 or 1576. Burke was an ardent supporter of Queen Elizabeth I, and left her husband shortly after the birth of her son Teigue due to her husband's rebellious activities. The couple had two other sons, Art and Eogan. After the separation, she wished to marry John Fitzgerald, the brother of James FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond, but he was killed in 1582. Instead, she married Theobald Burke, the eldest son of William Burke. They had four sons, John, Richard, Thomas, and Theobald, two of whom could have been twins. Her husband died in a skirmish with James FitzMaurice FitzGerald in 1579. After she was widowed, Burke fought to secure rights for her family. She was granted custody of Burke's lands and their son and heir, John, in 1580. In 1582 she lodged a complaint with the Irish privy council that \\"She and her tenants [were] utterly beggared by the rebels\\", and she had to live in Limerick town, and was seeking \\"payment of the head money for killing James Fitzmaurice\\". She was living in poverty in Limerick but by July 1582 she has been paid 1,000 marks \\"in consideration of the killing of the traitor James Fitzmaurice\\". Remaining in Limerick, her son Teigue was educated there in 1592. Under her influence, Teigue was loyal to England during the Nine Years' War, and was granted three castles and 445 quarters of land in County Leitrim in 1603 by James I. Burke's other children also remained loyal to England. Her son John died in infancy, and in 1600 Richard and Thomas were killed by Hugh O'Neill's mercenary captain Dermot O'Connor at Bunbristy Bridge. Theobald, her one surviving son from her second marriage, was favoured by James I who granted him large tracts of land across Ireland and created the title Baron Bourke of Brittas for him. Burke married a third time, to Sir John Moore, of Bryes, County Mayo. The couple had at least two daughters, Mary and Cicely. They made provision for Moore's family in 1611, when Moore granted his lands to Donogh O'Brien, 4th Earl of Thomond \\"to hold for the use of John Moore the younger\\". Burke and Moore retained the castle of Clonbigney and six quarters of land in County Mayo for themselves \\"during their lives\\". The exact date of Burke's death is unknown, but thought to be in the late 1620s. ==References== Category:1560s births Category:1627 deaths Category:16th-century Irish people Category:17th-century Irish people Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland Category:Irish nobility ","title":"Mary Burke (consort)"},{"id":"63898430","text":"Rev Jayawardene Welatantrige Edwin Boteju was a Ceylonese Christian Clergyman and legislator.

He recorded more than 500 78 rpm albums, among them the first electrical recording made in Brazil. He performed songs composed by musicians such as Cartola, Heitor dos Prazeres and Ismael Silva; and several songs became famous in his voice, like \\"Ai! que saudade da Am√©lia\\", or the first recording of samba \\"Aquarela do Brasil\\" by Ary Barroso.

(1832-1920) was a London businessman, a manufacturer, and financial organizer. He is perhaps most well known for his translation of The Bible in Modern English, which is commonly referred to as the Ferrar Fenton Bible. Fenton made translation of the Bible a lifetime avocation, spending approximately fifty years working on his translation, with the goal \\"to study the Bible absolutely in its original languages, to ascertain what its writers actually said and thought.\\" == Early life and career == Ferrar Fenton was born in 1832 in Waltham, Lincolnshire, England. Initially educated by his father, R. C. Fenton, he then attended private school. Fenton's parents originally wanted him to go into ministry, but he lost interest in spiritual matters by age 20. Following a university education, he began working in a factory, eventually becoming manager. He became involved in the diamond business in South Africa and eventually became head of DeBeers. While sources vary on the timing, at one point in his life a dishonest lawyer caused him to lose his fortune but he was able to recover and become successful again. In 1902, he was elected to membership in the Royal Asiatic Society. == Bible translation == Fenton was a Church of England Layman. It is said that he had knowledge of 25 Oriental and modern languages and dialects, including ancient Sanskrit, Greek, Hebrew and Latin. As a tradesman, he also had access to numerous ancient Septuagint and Masoretic manuscripts to aid in translation. He also used Brian Walton's Polyglot Bible (1657) for minimal referencing. Fenton viewed his career in business as background for his Bible translation work, saying, \\"I hold my commercial experience to have been my most important field of education, divinely prepared to fit me to be a competent translator of the Bible, for it taught me what men are, and upon what motives they act, and by what influences they are controlled.\\" According to Derek Wilson in The People's Bible, \\"Fenton set himself single-handedly to challenge the Darwinians and the higher critics and also to produce a new masterpiece in the English language which would replace the long-esteemed King James Version.\\" Fenton believed that unless a modern English version of the Bible were produced, the Christian faith would be lost and so he began work on his own translation in 1853. For the next 40 years, he only ever read his New Testament in Greek to avoid being influenced by previous translators. He first released a modern version of Romans in 1882 followed by his translation of Paul's epistles in 1883. Other parts of the Bible followed, until the complete Bible was published in 1903, with revisions published until 1910. His complete Bible continues to remain in print, and is currently published by Destiny Publishers. For some, Fenton's objective of replacing the King James Bible would seem to be a success. The Cambridge History of the Bible, while referring to his translation as \\"sometimes erroneous and amateurish,\\" suggests that the value of his work is in keeping the idea of modern language translation alive. == Works == * Connection of the Welsh and Oriental Languages * Seven Years of an Indian Officer's Life * Plassey, an Ode * Poems from the Persian * Memoirs of G.

The community was originally named Monterey in honor of the Battle of Monterrey, where the Mississippi Rifles served under Colonel Jefferson Davis. Later that year, the name was changed to Buena Vista in honor of the Battle of Buena Vista, where the Mississippi troops and Davis again served. A post office only operated under the name Monterey in 1847 and operated under the name Buena Vista from 1847 to 1972. Buena Vista was once home to multiple stores and two churches. The Buena Vista Normal College opened in Buena Vista in 1885 and was chartered by the state of Mississippi the following year. The first agricultural high school in Mississippi opened in Buena Vista in 1908. Cully Cobb, a pioneer of southern agriculture, long-term farm publisher, and an official of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration in Washington, D.C., was the superintendent of the school from 1908‚Äì1910. Company A of the 17th Mississippi Infantry was known as the Buena Vista Rifles and was organized in Buena Vista on March 28, 1861. Soldiers from this company served with the Army of Northern Virginia in many battles, including First Manassas, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Chickamauga, and the Appomattox campaign. Company A specifically served under William Barksdale at the Battle of Gettysburg and were part of Barksdale's charge on the Peach Orchard. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Chickasaw County, Mississippi Category:Unincorporated communities in Mississippi ","title":"Buena Vista, Mississippi"},{"id":"63898567","text":", (24 July 1963) is a 1980s era Japanese Pop Idol, singer-songwriter, composer, and actress„ÄéÂà•ÂÜäËøë‰ª£Êò†Áîª Ê≤≥ÂêàÂ•à‰øùÂ≠êÁâπÈõÜÂè∑„ÄèÔºàËøë‰ª£Êò†ÁîªÁ§æÂàä 1981Âπ¥Ôºâ. ==Career== Naoko was a regular on K≈çhaku Uta Gassen, an annual television program showcasing the country's most popular entertainers.

She was the fourth child of seven born to Frederick Winsor and Ann Bent Ware Winsor. She was also the sister of Robert Winsor, an American financier and investment banker, and relative of Henry Ware (Unitarian). == Background == Annie Ware Winsor was born in Winchester, Massachusetts on May 26,1865 to parents Frederick Winsor and Ann Bent Ware. She graduated from Winchester High School in 1881, and taught there until 1883 when she left to attend Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. After 2 years, she had to leave Radcliffe, but reentered in 1886 and was there until 1889. While she was a student at the school, she also taught college classes and was very active in student organizations. However, despite the time she spent at the school, she never received a degree because she had not met the entry requirements and/or graduation requirements. == Work and Marriage == After leaving Radcliffe, Annie Ware Winsor found herself in New York City where she taught at the Brearley School for girls. While in New York, she was an active member of the People's Choral Union of New York, and the Social Reform Club of New York. It is through her work in the Social Reform Club, that she became a tutor for Leonora O'Reilly, an organizer for the New York Women's Trade Union League. While in New York, Winsor lived with her Uncle, William R. Ware, in a boarding house he had. In 1897 they rented a house, and invited Annie's distant cousin, Joseph Allen, to live with them. Allen had earned both his A.B. and A.M. in mathematics from Harvard University, and continued with his graduate work until 1894, when he left the school to take up a teaching position at Cornell University. He left Cornell in 1897, and taught at the City College of New York until 1940. Annie Ware Winsor and Joseph Allen became engaged in 1899, and married in 1900. They continued to live in New York and had had three children by 1905: Dorothea Teulon (later Treadway), (1901-1994), Annie (Nancy) Winsor (1902-1993), and Joseph (\\"Jay\\"), Jr. (1905-1975). A fourth child, David, died after one week in 1906. In 1906, Annie Ware Winsor Allen moved, with her family, to White Plains, New York. Upon moving to the city, Annie became dissatisfied with the education system, and started homeschooling her children, and later neighbors' children. The next year, 1907, Annie founded the Roger Ascham School, which was a progressive, co-education school that included all grades from first to high school. Eventually, the school moved to Scarsdale, but returned to White Plains. A branch also opened in New York City. From 1907, until the school's closure in 1933, Annie Ware Winsor Allen served as its head mistress. During her tenure as head mistress, Winsor Allen also helped to establish the Head Mistresses' Association of the East. After her school closed, Winsor Allen started writing articles in the Ladies Home Journal, and other magazines. She primarily wrote articles about education and adolescent behavior, and had a column in the Ladies Home Journal in which she gave advice to parents. She often wrote under the pseudonym Marion Sprague, as well. She also wrote four books: Home, School and Vacation (1907), Psyche's Primer (1935), All of Us (1942), and Without and Within (1952). == Retirement == In 1945, the Allens' retired to Des Moins, Iowa, where they lived with their daughter Dorothea and her family. In 1946, Joseph died and Annie spent her time between Des Moins and Chicago, where her other daughter, Annie Winsor Allen, was principal of the Girls' Latin School. In 1954, Annie Ware Winsor Allen moved with her daughter, Annie Winsor Allen, to Nashville, Tennessee after she accepted a position to become Dean of Women at Fisk University.

He succeeded Governor Pieter Hackius after his death on 30 November 1671. Between Hackius's death and Breugel's appointment, the administration in the Cape was overseen by the Political Council. ==Biography== Van Breugel was appointed merchant and secunde (second in command) at the Cape in 1672. As the newly appointed Governor, Isbrand Goske, had not then arrived, he acted in his place until 2 October 1672. After Goske took control, it soon became apparent that he was not happy with the way Van Breugel handled the administration. Goske was specifically dissatisfied with how he handled the Company's books and kept them up to date. In February 1676, the VOC Commissioner Nicolaas Verburg decided to send Van Breugel to Batavia, since his administration showed a big financial deficit. After arriving in Batavia in August 1676, the Council of Justice acquitted him of Goske's charges. During 1680 he was elected a member of the College of Schepenen of Batavia and in January 1684, with the title of senior merchant, he became secunde in Banda, only to retire at his own request a month later due to ill health.

Milit√£o founded the Photographia Americana studio in 1875, where his clients included Castro Alves, Joaquim Nabuco, Dom Pedro II, and Empress Teresa Cristina. His rates were among the lowest in the city. The location of the studio in front of the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, frequented mainly by the Afro-Brazilian residents, led to his photography of prominent Black citizens of Brazil. He depicted Afro-Brazilians not as slaves, but as ordinary citizens. His other works were of singers and theater artists. A collection of more than 12,000 photos produced by Milit√£o de Azevedo was acquired by the Roberto Marinho Foundation in 1996 and donated to the Museu do Ipiranga of the University of S√£o Paulo. ==Life and career== S√© District, approximately 1860 Anonymous family, ca. 1870 Milit√£o Augusto de Azevedo was born in Rio de Janeiro on June 18, 1837. He began his career as a stage actor, participating in groups such as the Companhia Joaquim Heliodoro in 1858 and the Companhia Dram√°tica Nacional in 1860. With this last group, he traveled to the city of S√£o Paulo in 1862, where he moved in the same year and started a career as a photographer. Milit√£o pursued the careers of actor and photographer in parallel. He worked at the Companhia Joaquim Heleodoro (1858-1860) and at Companhia Dram√°tica Nacional (1860-1862), with whom he moved to S√£o Paulo at the age of 25. He became acquainted with the owners of the Carneiro & Gaspar studio in the 1850, and worked as a portrait artist for the partners. Milit√£o's experience in the theater had an important influence on his style of photography. While other photographers of the time were dedicated to the largest market of the time, the portrait market, Milit√£o exercised artistic and creative freedom in the choice of urban landscapes as the subject of work. When he arrived in S√£o Paulo in 1862, Milit√£o found a \\"small and introspective closed nucleus immersed in numbing sameness\\". The capital had a provincial atmosphere, but it was bustling, full of energy, and activities focused on material achievements. It was in this context that Milit√£o started his photographic work, documenting the population and their daily lives. Milit√£o acquired Carneiro & Gaspar in 1875 and changed it name to Photographia Americana. The studio has received numerous famous figures in its twenty years of operation. Despite this, the price charged for the photos was one of the cheapest in the city: five thousand r√©is. The studio was located in front of the Ros√°rio church, frequented the Afro-Brazilian population of S√£o Paulo; he photographed the Black population of the city as ordinary citizens rather than as slaves. Milit√£o worked mainly in S√£o Paulo between 1862 and 1887, producing images of houses, farms, public buildings, streets and panoramic shots; and organized albums with some of these urban scenes. The photographer also made portraits during excursions to other cities, especially during annual festivals. Some of his famous clients were the emperor, Dom Pedro II, the Empress Teresa Cristina, the jurist and politician Ruy Barbosa, the poet Castro Alves, the abolitionists Lu√≠s Gama and Joaquim Nabuco, Ant√¥nio de Lacerda Franco, Jos√© Maria Lisbon, Eduardo da Silva Prado, Friar Germano de Annecy and Rodolfo Amoedo. Despite the increasing popularity of the photographic market in 1884, Milit√£o facing serious commercial problems. He decided to put Photographia Americana up for sale in 1885, and auctioned off his furniture and equipment to travel to Europe. Despite disposing of the entire Photographia Americana laboratory and auctioning off photographic machines, materials and equipment, Milit√£o kept the textual and iconographic documentation of the business. The collection was maintained by the family of his eldest son, Luiz Gonzaga de Azevedo, with whom the photographer maintained close ties until his death. Probably influenced by the popularity of photographic albums featuring images of European cities, he produced similar albums focused on changes in the urban landscape of the city of S√£o Paulo. He released √Ålbum Comparativo de Vistas da Cidade de S√£o Paulo (1862-1887) in 1887, defined a model for urban landscape photography that focused on the comparison of urban landscapes between times. He Made other albums of the same kind, among them Vistas da Cidade de S√£o Paulo (1863), √Ålbum de vistas da Cidade de Santos (1864-65), √Ålbum de vistas da Estrada de Ferro Santos Jundia√≠ (1868) and √Ålbum Comparativo de Vistas da Cidade de S√£o Paulo (1862-1887).

He was involved in the development of Maltese military and police forces; he also convinced the British of the value of using anti-French Mediterranean levies. He was born in 1779 on Corsica and died whilst on duty as Lieutenant Governor of Zante in 1853, on the Island of Cephalonia. ==Family background== Not much is known about Francesco Rivarola's immediate family, or the exact circumstances of his birth and parentage. He bore the hereditary title of ‚Äòcount‚Äô from one of his forebears, who was created an ‚Äòimperial count palatine‚Äô for his services to the Holy Roman Emperor. The Rivarola family were originally from Spain via the Mantua area of Italy, but had become emigres after a dispute with the Spanish royal family of the time. Branches of the family had settled in Corsica, mainland Italy and Sicily. Francis‚Äô ancestors had been ambassadors, army commanders, painters and senior clerics in the Roman Catholic church. What seems certain is that his direct line descendants resettled in England and at least two male successors used the title Count Rivarola (referring to its derivation as bestowed by the Holy Roman Emperor).England Census 1881, Hammersmith St Pauls, Class: RG11; Piece: 58; Folio: 29; Page: 17; GSU roll: 1341013 ==Military career== Francis Rivarola was commissioned as an ensign into the Corsican Regiment on 4 April 1795, he was promoted to lieutenant into 22nd Regiment of Foot on 21 Feb 1798. In 1801 he gave the British a glimpse of his organisational skills when he raised a unit of Maltese Pioneers to support the British military expedition to Egypt. He was then elevated to captain in the Royal Corsican Rangers on 29 September 1804, continuing onto to be a major in the Sicilian Regiment on 6 February 1807 and then lieutenant colonel in the Sicilian Regiment on 7 March 1811. Rivarola proved and admirable recruiter and organiser moving as he did from the Royal Corsican Rangers to form the Sicilian Regiment. He was promoted to full colonel on 19 July 1821 and to major general on 22 July 1830. He is also credited with setting up the Royal Malta Fencible Regiment in 1815UK, The National Archives, Document Number CO 158/40, dated 9 April 1815, Maitland to the Secretary at War, re the formation of a local Corps and he went on to command the regiment and be its honorary colonel; finishing as lieutenant- general (promoted on 23 November 1841). Rivarola spent most of his operational service in action against the French and their allies in the Mediterranean, although for the most part he is recorded as carrying out garrison duties associated with being a senior officer, such as presiding over court-martials; one of which caused considerable controversy as it resulted in the dismissal of two Royal Artillery officers. Malta's Governor Sir Thomas Maitland newly arrived in post, was quickly impressed by the Corsican and made great use of Rivarola's management talents; and had him acting as the Islands' inspector general (police commissioner) during his first crisis: the 1813‚Äì1814 Malta plague epidemic. It has been postulated that the effects of the bubonic plague outbreak across Malta would have been considerably worse had it not been for Maitland empowering Rivarola to impose martial law and strict containment strategies on disease locales. Rivarola also played a critical role in dealing with and containing the spread of the Bubonic Plague on the island of Cephalonia (then part of his bailiwick), again Sir Thomas Maitland was fully content that the methods used previously on Malta would be used here. He died in 1853 on the Ionian island of Cephalonia, carrying out his duties as Military and Civil Commandant of Zante, Cephalonia and Ithaca. Ironically one of his sons (a former British Army officer) died on Cephalonia six years later on 8 May 1859. ==See also== * Siege of Malta (1798‚Äì1800) * French occupation of Malta * Maltese Provincial Battalions * 1813‚Äì1814 Malta plague epidemic * Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic) * Septinsular Republic ==References== Category:1779 births Category:1853 deaths Category:British Army generals Category:British Army personnel of the Napoleonic WarsCategory:Knights Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order Category:Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Military history of Malta ","title":"Francesco Rivarola"},{"id":"63899008","text":"Roger Rotherham was an English priest in the second half of the 15th century.\\"Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica: Antiquities in Leicestershire, Volume 7\\" p487: London; J.

On 2 November 1973, a Yak-40 aircraft operating the flight was hijacked by 4 people 10 minutes before landing. The aircraft was then diverted to Moscow's Vnukovo Airport, where the hijackers demanded a buyout and provision of a flight to Sweden. The hostages inside the aircraft were subsequently liberated after the authorities stormed the aeroplane. This is one of the first well-known cases of storming a hijacked aircraft on the territory of the USSR. == Aircraft and crew == === Aircraft === Yak-40K ‚Äî factory number 9120618 and MSN 18-06 ‚Äî constructed by Saratov Aviation Plant in July 1971 and delivered to the Ministry of Civil Aviation. It was registered as CCCP-87607 and sent to the Civil Aviation Administration of the Central Districts, tentatively to the Bryansk Aeroflot division. === Crew === Captain Ivan Kashin (36), was one of the first pilots to learn to fly the Yak-40. He graduated the Sasovo Civil Aviation School in 1957. First officer on the flight was Stanislav Talpekin, flight engineer ‚Äî Nikolai Nikitin. == Description == === Departure === The aircraft was operating a routine domestic flight F-19 (–§-19) from Bykovo Airport, Moscow, to Bryansk Airport. Yak-40 departed Moscow at 10:45 local time with 28 passengers and 3 crew members on board. The estimated flight time to Bryansk on that day was 50 minutes. === Hijacking === 10 minutes prior to landing at Bryansk Airport, four male hijackers (Viktor Romanov, Vladimir Zhalnin, Pyotr Bondarev, and Aleksandr Nikiforov) retrieved guns out of the overhead luggage bins and took passengers as hostages, then attempted to storm the cockpit. The noises from the passenger cabin reached the cockpit. Captain Kashin asked his flight engineer to investigate the situation in the cabin, and after Nikitin realised that there were hijackers on board, he immediately shouted the information to the flight crew and shut the door from the outside. The flight engineer tried to defuse one of the hijackers (Romanov), however, he was injured by Zhalnin. One of the passengers (Vladimir Gaponenko) attempted to defuse Bondarev, but he lost his balance from the aircraft pitching, and as a result got injured. In the flight deck Kashin sent a distress signal to air traffic control. Meanwhile, the attackers managed to break the lock on the cockpit door and entered the flight deck. Hijackers demanded the flight crew head back to Moscow. Whilst on approach to Vnukovo Airport, the intruders forced the crew to inform the authorities that they demanded a buyout of US$1.5 million for all hostages and for information about future aircraft hijacker groups. Despite difficult weather conditions in Moscow, the crew managed to successfully land the Yak-40 at Vnukovo. === On the ground === KGB Chairman (and future leader of the USSR) Yuri Andropov and the Minister of Internal Affairs Nikolai Shchelokov soon arrived at the airport and began developing a strategy to free the hostages. Hijackers let two injured hostages (Nikitin and Gaponenko) out of the plane. Then, the hijackers put forward extra conditions: the authorities must let them refuel the aircraft and give them half of the buyout in return for half of the hostages. The intruders plan was to fly to Leningrad, where they would let the rest of the hostages out and refuel the Yak-40, enough for them to fly to Sweden. Nevertheless, it was decided to not let the captured aeroplane out of Moscow, and instead storm the aircraft. A storming group of volunteer policemen (Mikhail Lyakhmanov, Vladimir Rakov, Aleksandr Mushkarin, Nikolai Kapustin and Aleksandr Popryadukhin) was put together by the authorities. This group secretly sneaked towards the plane and hid under it next to the front landing gear. After several hours of waiting the intruders were informed that the authorities were ready to transfer the money. At first, a suitcase full of fake banknotes was supposed to be carried by a KGB officer, but at the last minute he refused to do it, so a transport police officer carried it instead. After hijackers heard movements under the Yakovlev Yak-40, they assumed that the buyout was finally delivered. One of the hijackers (Nikiforov) opened the door, then sergeant Rakov pressed a pike pole against the door. Hijacker Zhalnin began shooting at the police officers, who retaliated. As a result, Nikiforov fell onto the airfield from bad injuries (and later died in hospital). At the same time, an armoured personnel carrier approached the aircraft and fired a line from the machine gun aiming at the plane, which suffered around 90 bullet hits. Tear gas was then used; however, the smoke bomb got stuck between the seats, which caused the upholstery to burn. As the smoke flocked the cabin, panic arose amongst the passengers, who started to escape the aircraft. Hijackers Bondarev and Zhalnin escaped the plane together with the passengers, whilst Romanov shot himself. As a result of storming the aircraft two passengers were injured, but none died. == Aftermath == === Hijackers fate === The two remaining hijackers were subsequently arrested. Zhalnin, who was 16 years old at the time, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. After being released he soon died. Pyotr Bondarev was declared insane with the help of his parents and was sent to a psychiatric hospital, where he spent 6 months. He died in Moscow in 2006. ===Commendation of crew=== On 19 December 1973 at a ceremony in Moscow, police officer Aleksandr Popryadukhin and captain Ivan Kashin were awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for courage. ===Fate of aircraft=== The Yak-40 was soon repaired and resumed operations.

The centre was extensively refurbished in 2008 at a cost of ¬£2.5 million. The improvements included a redesign of the centre's entrances as well as new lifts (replacing the original glass wall-climber lift that was the first in the UK). The Ridings Centre was purchased in 2015 by NewRiver.

All 141 of Maryland's state delegates were up for reelection. Prior to the election, there was little doubt that Democrats would hold their majority in the chamber. Maryland's House of Delegates has had a Democratic majority since the elections of 1920, and it remains a solidly Democratic in elections at both the national and state level. Still, there was some discussion about whether or not Republicans would be able to make inroads in the chamber, especially considering that popular incumbent Governor Larry Hogan was running for reelection at the top of the ticket simultaneously. These hopes were not met; though Hogan won his race by double digits, there was very little down-ballot appetite for Republicans, including in the House of Delegates. Democrats picked off eight seats from Republicans, while Republicans flipped one seat from Democrats. The result was a net gain of seven seats for the Democrats, which came from across the state. Six counties had seats flip to the Democrats, including two in Baltimore County. The one seat Republicans did pick up was in a conservative Anne Arundel County district where a retiring incumbent had switched parties from Republican to Democratic the month before the election. Overall, the results were a seen as a disappointment for Republicans, who had hoped Hogan's success would carry more Republicans to Annapolis. After the elections, Democrats held 99 seats to the Republicans' 42, meaning Democrats were in possession of more than 70% of seats in the chamber‚Äîenough to capture a two- thirds supermajority capable of overriding gubernatorial vetoes. Many factors contributed to the Democrats' gains, but President Donald Trump's unpopularity in the Old Line State, as well as Maryland's large and growing minority population and its heavily suburban nature, were among the most important. ==Election results== All election results are from the Maryland Board of Elections. ===District 1A=== ===District 1B=== ===District 1C=== ===District 2A=== ===District 2B=== ===District 3A=== ===District 3B=== ===District 4=== ===District 5=== ===District 6=== ===District 7=== ===District 8=== ===District 9A=== ===District 9B=== ===District 10=== ===District 11=== ===District 12=== ===District 13=== ===District 14=== ===District 15=== ===District 16=== ===District 17=== ===District 18=== ===District 19=== ===District 20=== ===District 21=== ===District 22=== ===District 23A=== ===District 23B=== ===District 24=== ===District 25=== ===District 26=== ===District 27A=== ===District 27B=== ===District 27C=== ===District 28=== ===District 29A=== ===District 29B=== ===District 29C=== ===District 30A=== ===District 30B=== ===District 31A=== ===District 31B=== ===District 32=== ===District 33=== ===District 34A=== ===District 34B=== ===District 35A=== ===District 35B=== ===District 36=== ===District 37A=== ===District 37B=== ===District 38A=== ===District 38B=== ===District 38C=== ===District 39=== ===District 40=== ===District 41=== ===District 42A=== ===District 42B=== ===District 43=== ===District 44A=== ===District 44B=== ===District 45=== ===District 46=== ===District 47A=== ===District 47B=== ==References== House of Delegates Maryland House of Delegates ","title":"2018 Maryland House of Delegates election"},{"id":"63899536","text":"Castle Bottom to Yateley and Hawley Commons is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest north of Fleet in Hampshire.

If it were to be properly described as a new species, the genus name would have to be changed since it is preoccupied by an extinct spider. It was initially thought to have been a spider until it was determined to have been a hoax.

It is a tributary of the Caney Fork River. ==Geography== The source of the creek is near Baxter, Tennessee, where it starts out as a mid-sized ephemeral to intermittent stream and quickly picks up the Boyd Hollow Branch. Upon meeting the Leftwich Hollow Branch and a big spring, the creek becomes perennial. As the creek grows in size, it begins forming a wide floodplain nestled between some steep hills. After flowing between some of these hills, it picks up one of the streams named Little Indian Creek. Next, it runs through the small unincorporated town of Buffalo Valley, near the creek's lower end. In southwestern Buffalo Valley, I-40 has a bridge over it, and the Buffalo Branch meets the creek just before its confluence with the Caney Fork. ==Little Indian Creek== Little Indian Creek is the name of two streams in Putnam County. One of these is a tributary of Indian Creek located entirely within Putnam County, the source of which is near Boma. The other begins in Putnam County extremely close to Gentry, then it descends through some hills and valleys before getting a wide floodplain and perennial flow similar to the big Indian Creek. Eventually, it briefly forms the Putnam County border with Smith County before crossing fully into Smith. As it enters Cordell Hull Lake in Smith County, its lake embayment borders the Indian Creek Campgrounds just before its confluence with Dillard Creek and ultimately the Cumberland River, less than two miles from Granville. ==References== Category:Rivers of Tennessee Category:Bodies of water of Smith County, Tennessee Category:Tributaries of the Cumberland River ","title":"Indian Creek (Putnam County, Tennessee)"},{"id":"63899763","text":"Claudio Bonanni (born 5 March 1997) is an Italian footballer who now plays for Birkirkara in Malta.Birkirkara FC signs Claudio Bonanni Birkirkara FC ==Career== Bonanni started his senior career with A.C.

It is endemic to Mexico. ==Taxonomy== ===Classification=== This snake was first described as species new to science in 1942. Subsequently, some authors have noted similarities between northern populations of the Mexican wandering garter snake and the southern subspecies of the western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans vagrans), leading them to reclassify the former as another subspecies of the western terrestrial garter snake under the name Thamnophis elegans errans. However, a 280 km gap of uninhabitable low desert separates the ranges of the two populations. Additionally, even the closest populations of Mexican wandering and western terrestrial garter snakes are still morphologically separated by the number and arrangement of scales, as well as the color of the tongue. Presently, Thamnophis errans is considered a valid taxon. ==Distribution and habitat== The Mexican wandering garter snake is endemic to Mexico, where it has been found in the states of Chihuahua, Durango, Jalisco, Nayarit, and Zacatecas. It has an extensive linear range in the pine-oak forests of the Sierra Madre Occidental. When conditions allow, this species is widely dispersed within its range. It can be found near streams or ponds, but may also be found around rock piles or logs some distance from permanent water. ==References== * Category:Reptiles described in 1942 Category:Reptiles of Mexico Category:Thamnophis ","title":"Mexican wandering garter snake"},{"id":"63899927","text":"Cartago Station is a railway station, managed by Incofer, located in Occidental district, in the Cartago canton of the Cartago province. ==Adjacent stations== To the north of the station is the bus stop to San Jos√©, managed by LUMACA. ==References== Category:Rail transport in Costa Rica ","title":"Cartago railway station"},{"id":"63899963","text":"Sini≈°a Mali Sini≈°a Mali plagiarism scandal refers to the political scandal in Serbia which led to the 2019 annulment of the 2013 doctoral dissertation of economist and politician Sini≈°a Mali by the Belgrade University.

Being a close friend of Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá, head of the SNS and president of the Republic of Serbia, his brother Andrej Vuƒçiƒá, and a school friend of Serbian prime minister Ana Brnabiƒá, Mali was vehemently defended by the entire governing and party establishment in what was described as the operation \\"defend and protect plagiarism\\" with the entire \\"machinery employed to defend the doctorate\\". On the other side, this triggered protests and public performances calling for the annulment of Mali's doctorate which ultimately blended into the wider civil and political Serbian protests since 2018. This was enhanced by the perception of his tenure as the mayor of Belgrade, which was described as the \\"deluge of affairs\\" while Mali himself was labeled the \\"walking affair\\", a \\"problematic character followed by his affairs\\", \\"controversial\\" and \\"scandal-ridden\\". The plagiarism was even described as a lesser affair compared to other political and economic ones Mali had in his career. Due to the scandal outbreak, Mali was never officially promoted to the rank of the doctor of philosophy, which didn't prevent pro- government media to title him that way. On the electoral list for the 2018 Belgrade elections, he even named \\"doctor of philosophy\\" as his \\"occupation\\".Electoral list for the coalition Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá ‚Äì zato ≈°to volimo Beograd On 12 December 2019, the Senate of the Belgrade University unanimously annulled Mali's doctorate due to plagiarism. Ten days later, Mali removed info on his doctoral degree from his official biography on the Ministry of Finance website, but he remained in office, refusing to step down and calling the decision political. The case has been often compared, unfavorably though, to the Guttenberg plagiarism scandal of Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, German Minister of Defense who resigned his post after the plagiarism was revealed. But, while in Guttenberg's case political epilogue came after 20 days and a legal one after 9 months, scandal with Mali's doctorate dragged on for 6 calendar years while he progressed in the political hierarchy. During the process, behavior of the faculty and university was labeled as shameful, and the entire process as the \\"mawkish saga\\" which ultimately was solved thanks to the students, several professors and public who didn't let the affair go away. The academia's fear of the politicians was blamed for the protraction of the process, but also the pressure of the ruling establishment on the FON and the obedience and corruption of intellectual elite. The doctorate of Mali was one in the series of , regarding dubious diplomas, master's degrees and doctorates of the high-profile public persons, mainly politicians (Tomislav Nikoliƒá, Neboj≈°a Stefanoviƒá, Miƒáa Jovanoviƒá, Jorgovanka Tabakoviƒá, Aleksandar Martinoviƒá, Igor Beƒçiƒá, Aleksandar ≈†apiƒá, , Aleksandar Vulin, Aleksandar Antiƒá, Zoran ƒêorƒëeviƒá). Mali's doctorate was the first annulled by the university itself (Jovanoviƒá's doctorate was declared non-existing earlier, in 2014, but it was done by , Minister of Education at the time). On 11 March 2015 European Parliament expressed concerns that neither academia nor political institutions deal with the problem of plagiarism. In 2018, membership of the National Entity for Accreditation and Quality Assurance in Higher Education of Serbia (NAT) in the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education was reduced from full membership to the adjoining member. This also coincided with the period of exponential growth of doctorates in Serbia. In 100 years, from 1905 (when Belgrade University was organized as such and organized doctoral studies) to 2005, on all universities which were formed in time, there were 16,860 doctorates. In the next 8 years, from 2006 to 2013, there were 9,000, with additional 15,000 doctoral students. There were 205 doctorates in 2007, 770 in 2012 and 2,012 in 2016. In only one week in 2016, 187 doctorates were awarded. The paradox is that the number of students in Serbia is below the European average compared to the total population, but the number of doctoral students is well above. One mentor has up to 15 students. 2014 survey showed that 65% of the faculties had no plagiarism procedure, and out of the remaining 35%, only few were able to explain what the procedure actually looks like. == Doctorate == Faculty of Organizational Sciences, where Sini≈°a Mali defended his doctoral thesis in 2013 Mentored by professor Dragan ƒêuriƒçin, Sini≈°a Mali in 2002 originally submitted his thesis at the faculty where he studied, the Faculty of Economics (EKOF). The title of the thesis was Privatization by the Method of Enterprises Selling - Theoretical Concepts and the Case of Serbia. After 9 years, the report on the work wasn't adopted by the EKOF in 2011, and Mali's public defense of the dissertation was refused. The faculty rejected his submission, concluding the work is of low quality and without scientific value. Mali then modified it and submitted it to the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Organizational Sciences (FON) under the title Value Creation through the Process of Restructuring and Privatisation ‚Äì Theoretical Concepts and the Case of Serbia. There he obtained his PhD in 2013.Tezu Sini≈°e Malog odbio Ekonomski fakultet, pa ju je odbranio na FON-u The commission included professors Ondrej Ja≈°ko (new mentor), Slaƒëana Barjaktaroviƒá Rakoƒçeviƒá and ƒêuriƒçin. Switching of the faculties later became part of the controversy. Professor ƒêuriƒçin, one of the members of the commission which accepted Mali's thesis at the FON, actually claimed that Mali wrote two doctorates, the one rejected at the FE, and one accepted by the FON. Submitting one the same thesis at two faculties is forbidden and the Faculty of Economics never published Mali's original thesis nor the reasons why it was rejected, so it remains unclear if these were different theses. Mali stated that he wrote the thesis for 3 years, which would mean that he concurrently wrote two theses. Dean of the FON at the time of Mali's defense of the thesis, professor Milan Martiƒá, confirmed that Mali's doctoral dissertation was rejected at the FE, after which he has published his dissertation at the FON. He also stated that 50% of the dissertation was different from the first one, but the original dissertation remained unpublished. == Initial plagiarism reports == On 9 July 2014 the website \\"Pe≈°ƒçanik\\" claimed that Mali had plagiarized at least one third of his PhD thesis. Ra≈°a Karapand≈æa, finance professor at the EBS University of Business and Law in Wiesbaden, Germany, and visiting scholar at the New York University and the University of California in Berkeley, showed that Mali plagiarized the thesis with the content from other theses, authored articles, site of the Agency of Privatization of Serbia and Wikipedia by publishing several examples. Karapand≈æa claimed at the time that Mali plagiarized at least 33% of the thesis, publishing data which confirmed some 18%. At that time, Mali said he \\"is firmly standing behind his work\\". In September 2014, German publisher De Gruyter announced that the article published in their journal, one of two which qualified Mali for the title, contains uncited paragraphs from the doctoral dissertation of Stifanos Hailemariam, a professor and economist from Eritrea, titled Corporate Value Creation, Governance and Privatisation: Restructuring and Managing Enterprises in Transition ‚Äì The Case of Eritrea, defended at the University of Groningen in The Netherlands, in 2001. On 20 January 2015, Simon Cifert, editor-in-chief of the journal \\"Organization and Management\\" which published the scientific work of Sini≈°a Mali, retracted Mali's text from the journal. After revision of the text submitted by the lead co-author, the editorial board of the journal republished the above-mentioned study, with an introductory note Corrigendum, citing another source from the literature used in the design of the study, which was claimed by the co-author to be a technical mistake in the previous version. 13 citations of Hailemariam were added, unlike the previous work which had no quotes by him at all. A group of the FON alumni sent an open letter to dean Martiƒá, claiming a blatant conflict of interest. One of the co- authors of the retracted article was Slaƒëana Barjaktaroviƒá Rakoƒçeviƒá. The article later became part of the thesis, while she became a member of the commission when Mali defended it. Additionally, the other article which quialified Mali to submit his thesis, Privatization Through the Sale of Equity ‚Äì Conceptual Framework and Archived Results in Serbia, was published in February 2013 in magazine Ekonomika preduzeƒáa, whose editor is Dragan ƒêuriƒçin, Mali's original mentor and another defending commission member. Group of authors, joined by the association \\"Save the science\\" (\\"Spasimo nauku\\") pointed out that even if two published works were non-plagiarized and legitimate, they wouldn't be acceptable for the doctorate defense. Code on Accreditation of the Study Programs stipulates that, in order to be accepted for the doctoral theses, work must be published in magazines listed at SCIndeks, Serbian version of citation analysis. Neither of Mali's articles was published in such magazines. == First faculty commission == Prompted by Karapand≈æa's report, the FON formed a commission to investigate Mali's doctorate. All three members of the commission were the same as the original thesis defending commission (Ja≈°ko, Barjaktaroviƒá Rakoƒçeviƒá, ƒêuriƒçin). In October 2014, this commission gave positive opinion on the thesis. They claimed that the process neither stipulated, nor it was possible, to use specialized software for discovering plagiarism and that media reports regarding the issue are not credible. The commission did state that certain parts regarding the literature listing were incorporated without quoting, which doesn't affect the doctorate's scientific contribution. In media, the findings of the commission were simply titled the Mentor's Report. The Scientific-Teaching Council (NNV) of the faculty accepted this report on 20 November 2014. Out of 154 members (NNV is made of professors and assistants), 118 were present: 117 yes, 1 abstained. On 10 December 2014, the Legal- Economic Sciences Council of the Belgrade University rejected this report, as out of 23 members, 11 voted to accept it. Some, including the \\"Save the Science\\" movement, took this as the official recognition of the plagiarism, calling for the university to annul Mali's doctorate immediately. Rector of the Belgrade University, , on 10 June 2015 asked the Legal-Economic Sciences Council to re-examine the case after the retracted article by De Gruyter was reposted with added references. The council refused to do so, waiting for the university's new code regarding the plagiarism process and ethical codes. Though announced for the end of 2015, they were adopted only in July 2016. The process was then returned to the FON, to start the new procedure. == Second faculty commission == In November 2016 the FON formed new Ethics Commission which included Milica Bulajiƒá, Mladen ƒåudanov, Srƒëa Bjeladinoviƒá, Veroljub Nastiƒá and Milo≈° Krstanoviƒá. On 19 December 2016 the commission rejected plagiarism report as unsubstantiated, concluded that citing omissions are negligible, that software checks can't be the basis for the proceedings and that it can not be challenged on the original scientific contribution of the doctoral dissertation as the scientific contribution is undisputable. Professor Karapand≈æa called the report meaningless, as the commission didn't try to dispute the plagiarism regarding the translation from English to Serbian, as checking software can't do that so it has to be done \\"by hand\\". He also said that, given the amount of copied/translated text, it can't be just citing omission. Du≈°an Teodoroviƒá, a member of the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts and president of the Academy Board for Higher Education sent 20 pages of evidence which he alleged prove the work is a plagiarism to the rector of the university asking for Mali's PhD to be annulled. On 18 January 2017, citing procedural reasons, the Senate of the University of Belgrade rejected the Ethics Commission findings, instructing the faculty to form an Experts Commission instead, as it should have done in the first place by the university's rule book. == Third faculty commission == === Failure in forming a commission === By April 2017, all members of the commission resigned, with the exception of professor ƒåudanov who was teaching at the chair headed by professor Ja≈°ko, Mali's mentor. The FON failed to assemble the next commission for 3 years. The faculty asked for help from the university's Rector Collegium, admitting that 4 of their professor refused to participate in the commission, which was to have 4 members: two appointed by the faculty, one by the university's council in charge of the subject (alter confirmed as the Council of the Social-Humanist Sciences), and one by the National Council for Higher Education. It was reported that the collegium managed to provide one member (originally only reported to be from Slovenia) and that National Council delegated professor Milan Jovanoviƒá who was neither present at the voting, nor accepted it. In October 2017, the National Council announced Italian professor Roberto Velardi as their member of the commission. Just two months later, Velardi withdrew citing health reasons. The Council of the Social-Humanist Sciences had no candidates as no one wanted to accept the appointment, even from the Faculty of Economics, as the member had to be an economic manager. Dean of the faculty Branislav Boriƒçiƒá said they even tried to find someone from other economic institutions, but no one wanted to accept it. He also added that his faculty \\"already tackled the problem and stated its mind in some way\\", alluding to the original refusal of Mali's thesis. During this vacuum, on 27 February 2018 a group of professors and doctors of philosophy delivered a request to the Belgrade University's Rectorate to prevent the promotion of Mali as the doctor of philosophy and to annul his PhD altogether. 379 doctors of philosophy, including 8 members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts signed a request, which also asks for the ethical scrutiny of three members of the commission which originally confirmed his doctorate. On the same day, economist and professor , accused Mali of blatantly copying study Novi model privatizacije u Srbiji (New model of privatization in Serbia), published in 2000 by Mijatoviƒá, Boris Begoviƒá and Bo≈°ko ≈Ωivkoviƒá. The study is available online and comparison showed that some sections were rewritten to the letter. A day later, rector Bumba≈°ireviƒá announced that the National Council for Higher Education will soon name its representative to the commission, adding that Mali is not a doctor of philosophy, since he hasn't been awarded the doctoral diploma yet, nor has he been promoted to PhD, neither he will be until the entire process is over. Still, on the Serbian Progressive Party's list for the local elections in Belgrade, set for 4 March 2018, Sini≈°a Mali named \\"doctor of philosophy\\" as his \\"occupation\\". === New commission === In February 2019, the FON formed an experts commission made of professors Dejan Eriƒá (Belgrade Banking Academy- Union University, Belgrade), Toma≈æ ƒåater (School of Economics and Business- University of Ljubljana, Slovenia), Dragan Mikereviƒá (Faculty of Economics- University of Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina) and Vinko Kand≈æija (Faculty of Economics-University of Rijeka, Croatia). With the help of the specialized software Turnitin, on 26 March 2019 they concluded that Mali properly quoted only 2 out of 126 quotations in his thesis, that he copied 4,500 words without quotations, but that he plagiarized only 6.97% of his thesis, which the commission claimed is not enough to dispute its scientific contribution. The commission found that actually 16% of the text is copied, but the difference came from the \\"official state reports\\", \\"common phrases\\", \\"formulas\\", etc. Mali copied texts from publications of the Agency for Privatization, which he headed at the time. Agency also claimed that some portions were erroneously recognized as plagiarism by the software. The commission also stated that Hailemariam's thesis was the \\"starting point\\" for Mali's thesis, even though Mali doesn't quote or mention Hailemariam in his PhD at all. Commission also ignored the accusations of plagiarism by Mijatoviƒá, Begoviƒá and ≈Ωivkoviƒá. The Experts Commission handed its decision to faculty's Ethics Commission. Made of ƒåudanov, Nevenka ≈Ωarkiƒá Joksimoviƒá (president), Milica Jovanoviƒá, Snje≈æana Jerkoviƒá and Mihailo Okiljeviƒá. the commission unanimously accepted the report on 2 April. On 8 May, the FON's NNV accepted the Ethics Commission report (110 members present, 82 yes, 28 abstained). The FON sent its report to the Senate of the Belgrade University, which decided to declare itself after the complaint deadline is over, and after the decision of the university's Professional Ethics Board. == Reactions and escalation == === Academia reaction === Professor Vesna Rakiƒá Vodineliƒá slammed the commission's report, saying you can't plagiarize a little and calling the report a textbook on hidden plagiarism. She drafted complaints on both 2019 decisions of the FON Despite the claim that 6.97% of plagiarism is not enough to annul the doctorate, ethical code of the Belgrade University states that plagiarism is \\"literal transcription of the other author's text, or copying from the electronic or printed sources, either in Serbian or foreign languages, in parts or entirety\\". Commission's bargaining regarding the percentage of plagiarism was described as the insipid, rude argumentation. Other professors protested, claiming that you can't \\"plagiarize a little\\", that, depending on the context, you can properly cite other authors but not the entire passages and pages, and that what the Experts Commission described is a textbook of \\"hidden plagiarism\\". In general, the commission was accused of polemicizing with Karapand≈æa's evidence instead of dealing with the thesis itself. The composition of the 4-members commission was also criticized. None of the members deal with the corporate finances, which is the theme of the PhD. One of them speaks no English so he couldn't compare the Hailemariam's doctorate to the Mali's one, only one published works in a journal with impact factor, while the third was removed from the state university after he was caught by the police for selling exams to the students. Also, the commission in its report referred to Mali as \\"doctor\\", which he still isn't as the University hadn't promoted him yet. Karapand≈æa pointed out again that Turnitin can't compare theses in two different languages and Mali literally translated it from English to Serbian word by word (with some extremely poor translations), using italics and bolded text in the exactly same places and copying almost all of the schematics and diagrams. The only thing Mali did was to replace Eritrea with Serbia in sentences. He used the same font, too. Mali even kept the example of value forming for cotton, which is one of the main crops in Eritrea but doesn't grow in Serbia. Teodoroviƒá also said there is a zero probability that two persons, from different parts of the world, name 100 exactly the same references, in the exactly the same order, including exactly the same typos. Karapand≈æa then showed that the commission actually only cited several pages which he originally published proving it was a plagiarism. He then published further 10 pages of blatant copies by Mali from Hailemariam's original thesis, which the commission never mentioned, asking the commission to tell what is the percentage of plagiarism needed to dispute Mali's PhD and also published 6 plagiarized illustrations. Karapand≈æa also noted that the fact that Mali simply copied texts from the government documents was taken as a mitigating circumstance, while in Germany, in the case of Guttenberg plagiarism scandal it was taken as an aggravated circumstance because of the misuse of state and government resources. Other complaints included material errors and some \\"absurdities\\". For the parts which Karapand≈æa proved that Mali simply translated, the commission commended him for better referencing than Hailemariam himself. But, for example, an author with two surnames at Hailemariam was referenced as two separate authors by Mali. Professor Bo≈æidar Radenkoviƒá, the only FON professor who signed the complaint said that the thesis is plagued with obvious plagiarism and that reports by the FON's Experts and Ethics Commission fall under the comedy genre. === Complaints and university reaction === Total of 4 complaints were filed to the university's Professional Ethics Board against the findings of the FON's commission. One, upheld by Todoroviƒá and , was signed by 140 university professors. Second complaint was filed by 3 professors from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law (Miodrag Jovanoviƒá, Goran Dajoviƒá, Bojan Spaiƒá) who challenged the report on percentage of allegedly allowed plagiarism and commission's erroneous effort to comment and examine scientific contribution instead of checking if it is an original piece of work. Third and fourth complaints were was filed by professors Predrag Simonoviƒá (Faculty of Biology) and Aleksej Tarasjev (\\"Sini≈°a Stankoviƒá\\" Institute for Biology Research), respectively. After the complaint period expired on 24 May, rector forwarded the complaints to the Professional Ethics Board. Acting upon the complaints, on 15 July the board again returned the doctorate back to the FON for new deliberation, giving them 60 days to do so. They concluded that the commission's findings, on which the faculty's decision was made, were \\"incomplete, unclear and contradictory\\". When published, board's report stated that faculty's commission didn't check if the doctorate is plagiarized at all, judging the ‚Äúscientific contribution‚Äù instead, which wasn't its task. The board also asked for feedback from both the faculty and Mali, regarding new complaints. The faculty responded to the board, Mali didn't. They also instructed the commission that software check is only one of the ways to check for plagiarism. Some professors criticized the board for not declaring a plagiarism right away, while others resigned their administrative posts in protest (Slobodan Prvanoviƒá, Ognjen Radoviƒá). Prvanoviƒá, deputy member of the board, resigned the post and accused the board of preparing the decision for returning the report months ago, in order to accommodate the ruling establishment in the state, to which Mali belonged. He asked the Senate to dismiss the board for being compromised, but that didn't happen. He also reported pressure he experienced from hiss director, head of the Physics Institute, Aleksandar Bogojeviƒá. Rector Popoviƒá asked for the professors not to pressure the board. Critics responded that the board was left alone for months and again made a bad decision, while the \\"post festum\\" criticism is not a pressure. === Blockade of the Rectorate === Building of the Rectorate of University of Belgrade was blocked by the students in September 2019 because Mali's doctorate wasn't annulled after 5 years despite all the evidence A group of students blocked the Rectorate of University of Belgrade on 19 July 2019, protesting the Senate's decision. During talks with the rector Popoviƒá, they asked for the university to push the prime minister Ana Brnabiƒá to dismiss Mali from the government (and Interior Minister Neboj≈°a Stefanoviƒá, also because of the plagiarism), in order to ease the pressure on the university to declare the doctorate a plagiarism. Popoviƒá asked for some time over the summer to see into the students' demands, so the students set a deadline for September, when they promised to continue their actions. On 13 September 2019, a group of students from the association \\"1 of 5 Million\\" locked themselves inside the Rectorate, blocking anyone from entering. Their main demand was that rector Popoviƒá, on Radio Television Serbia, calls for premier Brnabiƒá to sack Mali from the government citing conflict of interest since Mali, as a finance minister, assigns funds to the university's budget. Counter group, some of which admitted they were summoned by the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) also gathered, clashing with the students. Others were identified as party activists via social networks. Groups of citizens who supported the students gathered in front of the building, including some professors and public and opposition figures. University's governing bodies accused the students of non-academic behavior and political demands. Popoviƒá, however, began negotiations with the students stating that hostile takeover of the building, cutting off of water or electricity or any repressive measures towards the students are out of the question. Negotiations came to the stalemate until 22 September, when Popoviƒá acknowledged and condemned intrusion of the SNS activists into the building, which was one of the demands from the protesters, confirming that some members of the SNS group were obviously \\"not students\\". Negotiations continued, with Popoviƒá defending protesters adding the talks are the only course of action and that question of Mali's doctorate must \\"be solved\\". The agreement was reached when Popoviƒá announced she \\"stands by her students\\" who are \\"fighting for the autonomy and reputation of the university\\". As per compromise with the students, she gave a deadline to the Ethics Board until 4 November to decide whether Mali's doctorate is a case of plagiarism. On 25 September, students left the building. The rector guaranteed their request regarding Mali's doctorate will be executed. Popoviƒá also stated that the students who participated in the blockade must not bare any disciplinary or any other academic consequences. The students reiterated they organized the blockade because of Mali's plagiarism, and announced a new blockade, this time jointly with the professors who support them, if Mali's doctorate is not confirmed as plagiarism. === Governmental response === Prime minister Ana Brnabiƒá and then Belgrade mayor Mali, in 2017. In 2018 Mali entered her government as the Minister of Finance. Brnabiƒá, his high school friend, staunchly defended Mali, refusing to sack him from the government even after the plagiarism was confirmed Regarding the complaints and number of professor who signed them, Sini≈°a Mali said that collecting signatures doesn't bother him and that he believes in his knowledge and institution of university. He stayed quiet regarding the protests, but posted his diplomas and recognitions, and photos of him \\"still studying\\", on his Instagram account,Instagram account of Sini≈°a Mali though no one disputed his diplomas, only the doctorate. Prime minister Ana Brnabiƒá made a statement, expressing her support to Mali regarding the students' request during their blockade of the rectorate. She stated that Mali was her personal choice for a minister and that she was completely confident in her decision. She also said that without Mali there would be no reduction in payroll taxes, an increase of the minimum wage and other good things that happened. Brnabiƒá expressed her concern that the whole process was politically motivated. She said she did not want to interfere with the autonomy of the university, but as a citizen she noticed the contradictory statements of rector Popoviƒá. President Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá supported Mali and stated that the protest for his dismissal was organized by the students who want to influence the composition of the government. He added that Mali's appointment as a minister was the political decision of the ruling coalition. He also stated that the goal of the blockade itself is to elicit attention and not to improve student conditions. In order to explain how the actions of the students make no sense, Vuƒçiƒá said: Vuƒçiƒá labeled students as opposition activists who will not see the police intervention, \\"which they wish for\\". He said he supports \\"love between rector and students\\", adding \\"it is super for her not to enter her office in 15 days...it would be ideal for her not to do anything for another 15 days\\". Even pro-government media described the entire Vuƒçiƒá's approach as ironic. He said there is nothing rude in his statement that \\"she is in political love with members of the opposition parties\\". Brnabiƒá said she will not yield to the \\"ultimatum of 15-20 students\\" and sack Mali from the government, calling protests an anarchy and \\"hostage crisis\\". Popoviƒá called for all politicians to respect the autonomy of the university and freedom of thought and expression of its students, responding that with the 21st century technology, she doesn't have to sit in her office all the time anyway. Vuƒçiƒç also stated that Mali doesn't need diploma cause he may be a minister with only an elementary school education, since it is a political decision. Response from Karapand≈æa and others was that this is not an issue at all - what matters is whether someone is a \\"liar and a thief, or not\\". Vuƒçiƒá's \\"defense\\" was described as an indirect admission that Mali plagiarized his doctorate but that it doesn't matter anyway. === Defense campaign === Professors Todoroviƒá and Karapand≈æa were often attacked by the pro-government tabloids and members of Mali's political party. Mali labeled them \\"twitter professors\\", adding he will \\"continue to fight for better and more prosperous Serbia and for the higher quality of life for its every citizen\\". He described Karapand≈æa as \\"completely anonymous individual\\" who attacks him for political reasons. Tabloid Alo in August 2017 sent a letter to the dean of the Wiesbaden university, asking him to fire Karapand≈æa whom they accused of plagiarism and of smearing the names of Serbian citizens. Independent commission was formed by the university which cleared Karapand≈æa of all allegations from the letter, labeling them materially incorrect and non-academic, with the university supporting Karapand≈æa in debunking the fake doctorates. Alo refused to publish the rebuttal. Rectors and deans from the Belgrade University, academics, directors of the scientific institutes and numerous professors, received a letter from professor ƒêuriƒçin, Mali's original mentor and member of the original doctoral commission. The letter was actually an open discreditation of Karapand≈æa who, among other things, was accused of being part of the \\"mathematicians clique\\" which intruded into the economics and caused the global Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. Karapand≈æa also reported continuous threats he received. The problem with Mali's doctorate already spread outside of the academia limits and became a much wider social issue in Serbia, but after the agreement between the students and the rector was reached, a full blown media attack against university professors began. They were attacked by the pro-regime media, highest state officials, members of parliament and members of the ruling party. Main focus was on two most media exposed members of the negotiation team with the students, rector Popoviƒá and professor Danijel Sinani, on professors Karapand≈æa and Teodoroviƒá from before, but campaign was also directed against other professors who publicly denounced Mali's doctorate, like Danica Popoviƒá and Ognjen Radonjiƒá. Accused directly by Vuƒçiƒá and Brnabiƒá for \\"crossing the red line\\" and losing her neutrality for agreeing with the students, rector Popoviƒá said: \\"I am not neutral. I am on the side of the University\\". It was claimed that her \\"paternal uncle was Stalinist and head chopper\\", it was called for governmental inquiry against her, while the university was labeled an opposition lair. She was also mocked because of her appearance and dressing style (\\"physically neglected\\", \\"cleaning lady\\"). Sinani was attacked on ethnic lines, especially on Happy TV. The executive and host Milomir Mariƒá declared Sinani the \\"representative of Tha√ßi and Haradinaj\\", who, being an Albanian, teaching Albanian language and having \\"suspicious surname\\", has no moral grounds to judge anything in Belgrade. Mariƒá said that Sinani is teaching some \\"roka mandolina\\" (Albanian folk song which became quite popular in Yugoslavia in the 1970s). Sinani, however, is not Albanian but Gorani, teaches Folk religion of the Serbs and several other anthropology of religion classes, was a longtime president of the National Committee for the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Serbia and a pivotal member of the team which helped inclusion of kolo, gusle and slava as Serbian elements on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. President of Serbia Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá, though admitting he hasn't read Mali's thesis, claimed it was not plagiarized. He verbally attacked and insulted professors and public figures who debunked Mali's plagiarism Danica Popoviƒá was accused of plagiarism. Vocal opponent of the regime in general, and already cleared by the faculty commission, she became target of continuous, highly aggressive plagiarism campaign. Tabloids also accused one of the opposition leaders and former mayor of Belgrade, Dragan ƒêilas of bribing members of the FON's Ethics Commission to vote in favor of plagiarism. They claimed ƒêilas \\"bought\\" one professor for ‚Ç¨50,000, while promised another one office of the dean after the government change. However, student-prorector Danilo Potpariƒá claimed that one member of the Student Parliament offered him bride to vote that the thesis is not plagiarized. He was offered to \\"split the money\\" with the person who offered it, but after he refused this person said it was just a joke. Potpariƒá didn't want to disclose the name of this person. Potpariƒá was to be re- elected, but he and the university's teaching-prorector Petar Bulat were removed from the session, delegates who supported his re-election were replaced and another student was then elected instead of him. Tabloid Alo continued to call Karapand≈æa a plagiarist, accusing him of \\"spitting on everything Serbian\\" and of campaigning against Serbia. He was described as the cutpurse and \\"scientific abomination\\". All government tabloids and TV stations at the same time published the story, claiming the truth behind the campaign against Mali. According to this, Sini≈°a Mali as the chairman of the Board of Directors of Komercijalna banka in 2013, refused to buy the software sold by the Center for Innovation and Finance (CIF), a company where Karapand≈æa was one of the shareholders and was inventor of the software. One year after Mali refused to buy the software, Karapand≈æa posted that his PhD was plagiarism. Karapand≈æa gave the exact data when CIF was actually invited to a tender by the bank. It was in 2009 and 2017, while Mali was board member from 2013 to 2014, which can be confirmed by the board members from the EBRD. He added that Mali is doctor as much as Dr. Dre or Dr Nele Karajliƒá. Dejan ≈†o≈°kiƒá, former Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, also refuted the claim. Karapand≈æa and ≈†o≈°kiƒá were then accused of \\"wasting\\" another bank, Srpska Banka. Additionally, Karapand≈æa was accused of falsifying report on his plagiarism from his university. Karapand≈æa was also accused of \\"robbing\\" and racketeering other banks and being a member of the \\"mafia octopus\\". Karapand≈æa responded that he may be the head of the Mexican drug cartel but that doesn't diminish the scale of Mali's [intellectual] theft. He compared Guttenberg's case, saying that Serbia not only can't compare to Germany, but can't be compared to Zimbabwe either. The doctorate of Grace Mugabe was annulled after 4 years, while President of Zimbabwe (and her husband) Robert Mugabe wasn't organizing press conferences in New York, from the annual United Nations General Assembly session, to call professors who caught Mali in stealing the \\"haters [of Serbs and Serbia]\\", like president Vuƒçiƒç did. For the short period of time, media star of the pro-regime media became student Aleksandar Jak≈°iƒá. He initially accused Danica Popoviƒá of textbook plagiarism and then for selling the grades to her students behind the closed door of her cabinet. Every time he would appear on TV, he had more and more papers with him, weaving the web of corruption which included all the major accusers of Mali for plagiarism and generally summarizing government accusations against them. He called Popoviƒá and her assistant Jelena Ra≈°koviƒá criminals and filed official complaint, but the Faculty of Economics cleared Popoviƒá of plagiarism. She responded that she has been attacked because of Mali's doctorate, that Jak≈°iƒá bragged he is a cousin of Bratislav Ga≈°iƒá, head of Serbian Security Intelligence Agency (BIA), and reported Jak≈°iƒá to the disciplinary commission. Jak≈°iƒá then denied he is Ga≈°iƒá's cousin. After several disciplinary commissions, where Danica Popoviƒá was the first professor to report the student, it was proved that Jak≈°iƒá accused her of selling exams on one of the faculties public discussions (he said it was an \\"open secret\\"). His defense was that he has the right to say things even without any proof or witnesses, cause his oppionion is not the claim (\\"You can't do anything to me\\"). He found no witness to support him at the commission, while Popoviƒá's witnesses, other professors and academics, Jak≈°iƒá called out for the lack of credibility. He was supported by president Vuƒçiƒá who said that Popoviƒá is \\"the professor who is harassing the student who stood up to her at her class\\". The commission gave the sanction of strict reprimand to Jak≈°iƒá, while Popoviƒá asked for him to be sacked from the faculty. Months later, Jak≈°iƒá continued to call out Popoviƒá, but then also accused Karapand≈æa of plagiarism again, despite his university cleared him already. He then involved Karapand≈æa, former governor and professor ≈†o≈°kiƒá, and professors Boris ≈Ωivkoviƒá (whose co-authored work Mali plagiarized), Branko Uro≈°eviƒá (Karapand≈æa's former mentor) and Milojko Arsiƒá (who debunked president Vuƒçiƒá's claim on the state of Serbian economy) into the corruptive \\"web of professors\\". Jak≈°iƒá claimed he discovered some of the things by \\"accidentally clicking the mouse\\". He also attacked professors Teodoroviƒá and Srbijanka Turajliƒá of corruption and hypocrisy. After a while, Jak≈°iƒá disappeared from media. The attacks were so wide and below any professional standards, that even some government controlled agencies reacted, not just the independent ones. Ministry of Culture and Information issued a statement calling for strict following of the Serbian Journalists Code and \\"generally accepted moral norms\\", labeling the attacks \\"unsuitable rhetoric\\" and \\"unacceptable...pejorative, false and incriminating context\\". Regulatory Authority for Electronic Media (REM) filed charges against Happy TV. Several journalists associations filed criminal charges against Milomir Mariƒá from the Happy TV, who personally attacked professor Sinani. Support came from the students and number of faculties, professors and civil organizations, which deemed the attacks loathing and chauvinistic, or continued to further debunk Mali's doctorate. Still, the operation \\"defend and protect plagiarism\\" continued, with the entire \\"machinery employed to defend the doctorate\\", while the University remained under the \\"barrage fire\\" by the state representatives. In Mali's defense, government media claim that while for the \\"five and a half years every word is being measured\\" in Mali's doctorate, in the world, up to 20% of plagiarism is allowed if it's \\"not essential\\", and that EU University (which doesn't exist) confirmed that Mali's doctorate is not plagiarism. == Fourth faculty commission == === Decision === The FON's Ethics Commission formed the same Experts Commission as in January 2019, which on 23 October 2019 submitted exactly the same report as the previous time, that percentage of plagiarism doesn't call for any sanctions. The commission dismissed all complaints, claiming that the only important thing is the scientific contribution, even though that was not the merit the commission was formed to judge. Accepting this report, two days later, the Ethics Commission submitted its own report to the NNV, but this time adding it hadn't \\"enough facts\\" but that there are \\"elements of non-academic conduct\\", recommending \\"public reprimand\\" of Mali. Prior to the session of the FON's NNV, the students covered the entrance with the messages against plagiarism. One of the FON's professors, Mirko Vujo≈°eviƒá, labeled the students \\"terrorists\\" and said that faculty shouldn't mess with this at all and let the University to deal with it. The NNV accepted the report but changed the recommendation to \\"public condemnation\\", the stricter type of sanction. Some members of the council stated that this practically instructs the University's Ethics Board to annul the doctorate. Representative of the FON's students in the NNV, Moma Kovaƒçeviƒá, stated that this means Mali has no support of the council anymore. Several council members wanted for the council to vote directly on plagiarism, but this was ignored by the FON's dean Milija Suknoviƒá. Hence, the faculty never actually voted whether the work is plagiarism or not. This didn't stop pro-government media to report that it was again voted that the doctorate is not plagiarism. One of the opposition leaders Dragan ƒêilas was accused by the ruling establishment for paying the students to protest and for \\"buying\\" members of commissions which deliberated on Mali's doctorate The report sent to the university's Ethics Board had more than 699 pages, analyzing the doctoral dissertation. Commission members (Eriƒá, ƒåater, Kand≈æija, Mikereviƒá) requested a meeting with board members to substantiate their views about the indisputable scientific contribution of Mali's work. The decision was a controversy within the controversy: the work was not declared non-original or plagiarized, but the author was to be admonished for his non-academic behavior. Dean Suknoviƒá, though obliged by the decision, didn't reprimand Mali with \\"public condemnation\\". It was later discovered that Suknoviƒá tried to skip the process and avoid the voting of the NNV by sending the commission report directly to the university, thus evading FON's obligation to make a decision, but the rector returned it back to the faculty asking them to follow the procedure. === Reactions === Mali stated: \\"I am glad they again confirmed my doctorate is not plagiarism, cause I know I wrote it, I am confident in my knowledge, I am confident in what I have done. But here, for some errors that were made I will accept the responsibility and let's move on\\". He accused opposition of politicizing and spinning the issue, labeling them as fascists. Mali also added that he would \\"most gladly tear his doctorate and write another one\\" and that opposition is attacking his doctorate because they have no plan or program and can't say anything bad about him because \\"salaries and pensions are rising\\". General public consensus was that Mali (jokingly called \\"financial guru\\") will stay in office, despite everything. He was openly called out for his lack of moral and for not showing the shred of remorse because of the affair and the damage it brought. He blamed everyone else, calling the process political, but it became political because of the behavior of the ruling establishment which pressured the academia. Though Mali previously stated he takes responsibility for the quotation mistakes, he first relativized the issue saying that \\"they claim they have found 6,97%\\", but in the end he completely rejected any fault, blaming the original doctoral commission instead: That's not even my error, it is an error of the commission, cause, someone was looking at it. Given the date when the FON made its decision, in order to follow the due process and because of the deadline for complaints, the final date for decision was moved to 11 November, or 13 November in case of the rector's complaint. Citing further procedure, rector Popoviƒá then gave 22 November as the final date, apologizing to the students, who decided to wait, but without any apologies, pleads or concessions after that date. The students repeated they will resume the blockade if Mali's deoctorate is not declared a plagiarism, regardless of the new, private, ununiformed security guards who suddenly appeared in the Rectorate building, restricting movement of the students. When rector Popoviƒá came to the hall, new guardsmen hid from her. Some professors publicly announced they will join the blockade this time. Rector confirmed there will be no more returning of the decision back to the FON and that decision by the university board will be final. This time, a group of over 200 university professors filed a joint complaint against the decision of the FON. Later, four other complaints were filed, lifting the number to almost 300 professors. For the first time, Mali also filed complaints in his favor. Three complaints, one by him and two by his attorneys, had a total of 3,000 pages. He didn't claim the doctorate is not a plagiarism, but cited numerous formalities and technicalities in the process claiming he never received any decisions from the academic institutions, that no one of the persons who filed complaints since the process began actually have the right to do so and that filed complaints are not properly structured. Because of this, his attorneys planned to file counter-complaint to every complaint by the professors. == Ethics Board == On 21 November 2019, university's Professional Ethics Board overturned the faculty's decision and unanimously confirmed the non-academic behavior of Sini≈°a Mali while writing his doctorate. Rector Popoviƒá stated he violated the Article 22 of the University's Code of professional ethics, because he literally included texts and entire passages in his dissertation, without naming the original authors. The Board also reprimanded Suknoviƒá for only suggesting the reprimand of Mali, and not going through with it, as it was his duty. The Board sent its decision to the Senate to make the final decision in accordance with the guidebook on the process of nullifying diplomas and other works. The terminology used was \\"non-academic behavior\\", but the rector later that day clarified that is was a case of plagiarism. Professor Vladeta Jankoviƒá said that the original commission, and especially Mali's mentor, should be next, while professors Biljana Stojkoviƒá and Teodoroviƒá announced further complaints against Mali's PhD mentor, all members of the commission which endorsed his doctorate and all members of the commissions which declared his doctorate a non-plagiarism. Popoviƒá ended her statement with words \\"We'll bee seeing each other more. Pleasant day\\". === Board findings === The decision was formalized and made public on 28 November 2019. The Board deliberated on the complaint by the rector Ivanka Popoviƒá (compilation of 5 academia complaints) and on the complaint by Sini≈°a Mali and his attorneys Andrija ƒêuroviƒá and Nemanja Vasiljeviƒá. By the Board's decision 10 br. 612-2294/34-19, the decision of the FON's NNV was overturned and the non-academic conduct of Sini≈°a Mali was confirmed. They concluded that Mali violated article No. 22 of the University's Code of professional ethics - plagiarism. Mali's complaint, that is, a request for the re-evaluation of the FON's decision was rejected as inadmissible. The FON's decision was classified as unlawful since it lacks clear explanation, description and qualifications of the non-academic behavior for which it suggested reprimand of Mali. Also none of the commissions and the NNV failed to comply to the previous guidelines by the Board in order to improve the decision and all of them showed lack of readiness to establish true and complete facts relevant for the matter. Especially since, in this case, the facts were indisputable and easily established by simply comparing Mali's doctorate with the works of other authors. Failure also include the fact that they never included copied text from Haimelariam's dissertation into the plagiarized section of Mali's thesis (the previously reported 6.97%) and inability of different faculty bodies to take one, joint stand on the issue. As the FON decided not to compare Mali's thesis with other works, the Board took it upon itself to do it. The results of the comparison with Haliemariam's work showed that on 35 pages, Mali copied Hailemariam's thesis (with the detailed list of pages from both doctorates). Of those, 30 pages were plagiarized more than 50%, while 16 are completely or almost completely copied so the Board concluded that Mali literally copied (translated) Hailemariam's work which is neither referenced nor mentioned in the bibliography, nor the text was marked with the quotation marks. The Board's stance was that an aggravated circumstances for Mali include copying of entire passages and pages, and adopting Hailemariam's references as his own. Out of 96 footnotes, Mali took from Hailemariam 51, or more than a half. The Board then compared the doctorate with the study Novi model privatizacije u Srbiji by Begoviƒá, ≈Ωivkoviƒá and Mijatoviƒá. Mali copied the study on 9 pages in total, of which 2 were coped more than 50%. He even included plagiarized work from the study in the conclusion of his thesis. The study is, just like the Hailemariam's dissertation, never mentioned in his work (references, footnotes, bibliography, no quotation marks). Taking all this in account, the Board made a decision on plagiarism, which was described as \\"evident and indisputable\\". Mali's complaints on the process were dismissed, with detailed explanation of the regulations. Regarding Mali's complaint that he wasn't allowed to participate in the process, the Board said that Mali sent his reply to the FON's request on 14 December 2016, while all documentation regarding the matter was sent by the Board to him so he wasn't excluded. For another Mali's complaint, that the complaints against the FON's decision were filed by unauthorized persons, the Board explained that those five individual complaints were only parts of compiled rector's complaint, and the rector is authorized to file it. Also declared inadmissible was Mali's complaint regarding his reprimand by the FON. The faculty's NNV only suggested it, while it has no power to actually make it effective. It is dean's duty, but since he never did it, the complaint was pointless. As president of the Board, professor Vuk Radoviƒá signed the decision. === Reactions === Mali commented on the decision: \\"I am confident in my knowledge. I know I did not do it. This topic means to some people for political reasons and that I can not even comment. In any case, in the next few days I will address this topic more extensively, and now, to be honest, I am interested in the budget of Serbia and to deal with what I have been paid for by the citizens of Serbia\\". President Vuƒçiƒá said he is not surprised by the university's \\"deeply political decision\\" and continued to insult and dispute people who were active in debunking the plagiarism, or were connected to them, adding Mali is doing \\"excellent work\\". He asked who gave \\"them\\" the right to dispute Mali's doctorate, labeling them \\"half-literate\\", \\"highly uneducated leaders of political parties\\", \\"uneducated elite\\", \\"worst students\\" or, ironically, \\"great experts\\". Vuƒçiƒá said that this decision confirms he is not a dictator, since this is a political decision aimed against the government and that such things were impossible under he previous regime, so he concluded that Serbian society advanced greatly. The government establishment was described as finally coming to the realization that the plagiarism was actually confirmed and its reaction was characterized as orchestrated, not so much as an effort to clear Mali's name, but to provide excuses for keeping him in the government. Both prime minister Brnabiƒá and president Vuƒçiƒá said that Mali will remain in office. With other ministers, deputies and party members, they all called the university's decision a political one, praising Mali's economic achievements. Brnabiƒá said that the obvious indicator this was a political decision was the talk show \\"360 Stepeni\\" on N1, non-nationwide cable channel from 31 October, three weeks prior to the Board's decision, when two leaders of the non-parliamentary opposition parties, Dragan ƒêilas and Sergej Trifunoviƒá expressed their firm belief that the doctorate will be annulled. The claims of fierce opposition forcing the University to bring anti- government decisions is contrasted by other, concurrent claims from the government, that the opposition is almost non-existent, unimportant, utterly disliked by people and that no one would vote for them. Commentators noted the unpleasantness, as the push from the position in charge of pressure (president Vuƒçiƒá, \\"it is decided there is no plagiarism in Mali's work, he just messed some footnotes\\"), with all mechanisms for enforcing the pressure, actually failed. It was first such slap in the face of the government after a long time. Reaction of prime minister Brnabiƒá was deemed especially nervous. Rector Popoviƒá said that the decision is academic and made by experts, without presumption of Mali's capacity in the government. On the parliamentary session where the budget, presented by Mali, was discussed, almost every deputy from the ruling coalition spoke about the political decision of the university and praised Mali, calling for his stay in the office. Speeches included: explanations that he wasn't elected because of the doctorate but because of his expertise, calling a Daltonist everyone who can't see this is a political decision, calling university pathetic, mocking the students, claims of conspiracy that this is just the first step in annulment of all doctorates obtained by the members of the ruling party, labeling the process of annulment as the amounting of various destructive energies and a conspiracy against president Vuƒçiƒá, labeling the plagiarism as \\"allegedly some kind of plagiarism\\". Some labeled the rector as \\"Mali's executioner\\" and called for her to resign instead of Mali. Muamer Zukorliƒá, president of the Education Board of the National Assembly of Serbia, urged president Vuƒçiƒá to \\"deal with the University\\" as he saw the plagiarism process as an anti-government rebellion. \\"Either you will get them, or they will get you\\", he said Tabloids called Mali to keep the office and not to pay attention to the \\"danglers\\". Some views were even more extreme. Head of assembly's Education Board Muamer Zukorliƒá called the process \\"rebellion against the government\\" and a \\"bad sign\\". He stated that if this \\"clash with the government\\" is taken lightly, it will be an \\"announcement of fiercer attacks\\". He labeled the plagiarism happenings as the fire that is not to be underestimated and a systemic disease. He openly warned Vuƒçiƒá that he must not pass this as it is, otherwise it will be \\"either you will get them, or they will get you\\". Zukorliƒá founded private International University of Novi Pazar in 2002, which worked ever since but was never accredited. Though leader of the Justice and Reconciliation Party, Zukorliƒá was nominated to head the assembly's Education Board by the Vuƒçiƒá's party. Opposition contested his election to the post in 2016 as a blatant conflict of interest. Organization MASA (Academic Solidarity and Engagement Web) stated concern with how much vengefulness and anger was in parliamentary speeches against the University. They especially named Zukorliƒá for his call on Vuƒçiƒá to deal with the university, and asked from his removal from the position of the board president. Zukorliƒá said that his call for the reckoning between Vuƒçiƒá and university was \\"poetic\\", but that examining only Mali's doctorate because he is a politician is dishonest and criticized opposition for debunking the fake doctorates of the ruling establishment. Some professors pointed out that because Mali is a politician in the ruling establishment, the process actually dragged for so long. Vuƒçiƒç said he will propose the state financed digitalization of all existing magister and doctoral theses, so that anyone can read and compare them, especially the doctorates of Karapand≈æa and Bojan Pajtiƒá, former president of the Democratic Party. However, the doctoral theses are already published publicly since 2014. He also sent mixed signals saying that he has no intention to bow in front of the political decisions but also that Mali has to pay the political price, not specifying what and when: In Mali's defense, Vuƒçiƒç compared his ordeal with one of the greatest Serbian authors, Danilo Ki≈°. In an interview with Milomir Mariƒá at \\"Happy TV\\", where he is regular (talk show ƒÜirilica), he said: Do you know who was investigated, whose doctorate was abolished, under question? Well the great Danilo Ki≈°. So I think that it is much more important what Sini≈°a Mali can do for the country in the public finances department. However, this was false information as Ki≈° had no PhD at all. He was actually accused in 1977 of plagiarizing one of his major works, A Tomb for Boris Davidovich and managed to defend himself in court, though the controversy remained. Writers and literature critics heavily criticized comparison between Ki≈° and Mali, calling it the brutal disrespect of cultural values, bizarre, distasteful and shameful mudslinging of Ki≈° for which Vuƒçiƒá should apologize. Even more so, as Ki≈° wasn't declared a plagiarist, while Mali was. Some other reactions were ridiculed, like the statement of Mali's colleague in the government, Minister of Transportation Zorana Mihajloviƒá, that plagiarism is a private matter between Mali and the University. Opposition parties and movements asked for Mali's resignation. Several protests and marches were organized by the \\"Ne Davimo Beograd\\" movement, asking for the removal of Mali from the government. Students who organized the blockade of the Rectorate declared a victory. A group of students from the \\"1 of 5 Million\\" movement organized a march which ended in the park which encircles the House of the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia where they organized a symbolical funeral for the 2020 budget of Serbia, stating that Mali must not be the one who is tailoring a budget. Managing of the state vault by Mali has been described as giving the goat to guard the cabbage by professor BIljana Stojkoviƒá. On the protests and marches Mali has been given the red cards, which was the title of the march (\\"Red card for Sini≈°a Mali\\"). The students objected his staying in office openly saying that the thief can't draft the budget. Activists from \\"Ne Davimo Beograd\\" chained and locked the building of the Ministry of Finance. The Board for Higher Education of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts supported University's Board decision and its right to make decisions within its authority. President of the board, professor Todoroviƒá continued to be under the attack of the regime media, and at one point said that building of one of the major propaganda televisions, Pink TV, should be demolished. Pink TV's owner, ≈Ωeljko Mitroviƒá, in his usual manner when he confronts someone who is critical on him, his TV, or president Vuƒçiƒá, wrote an \\"open letter\\", which was then aired several times a day for several days. Among other things, he called Teodoroviƒá \\"the stupidest and least talented person among the academy members\\". Serbian Academy condemned Mitroviƒá's behavior and his insulting of Teodoroviƒá on political basis. Opposition and the students also accused Mali of taking a revenge on the Belgrade University as the money allocated for the university in the state budget was reduced from 19.24 billion dinars (‚Ç¨163.75 million) in 2019, to 18.71 billion (‚Ç¨159.25 million) in the new budget for 2020, which was proposed in November 2019. Mali called them liars, saying that the university budget consists of two parts: one funded by the state and one filled by the university's own income. He stated that the part provided by the state was enlarged by 804 million dinars, or ‚Ç¨6.85 million (10.4 to 11.3 billion dinars, or ‚Ç¨88.5 to ‚Ç¨96.2 million), but university planned much lesser income, hence the total reduction. Mali addressed the opposition: You probably know, and you should ask the leadership of the University, you know them better than I do, why is their own income lower, so their total budged is lower, too\\". The news on Mali's plagiarism made worldwide news. On the other hand, despite the years long tensions, which especially escalated in 2019, none of the regime tabloids printed the news on the annulment on front page. == Annulment by the Senate == On 12 December 2019, the Senate of the Belgrade University unanimously and officially annulled Mali's doctorate due to the plagiarism. When it comes to the university procedures, the decision is final and there can't be any further complaints regarding the matter. Actually, the Senate only accepted the Board's decision, without opening the debate on the issue. The FON's dean Suknoviƒá, member of the Senate, this time voted for the annulment of Mali's doctorate. The University sad that Mali has the right to file the complaint to the Administrative Court. The court can't discus or revert the merit of the Senate's decision, but can return it to deliberation due to the technical reasons in the deliberation process. === Reactions === Mali initially refused to comment on the decision. On 15 December 2019 he said he is \\"targeted by the opposition, so as president Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá\\" because they can't \\"forgive the success\\" of the two and that he doesn't report to the opposition, but also praising his own economic knowledge and patriotism. After Danas newspaper published an article on Mali's biography on the his ministry website where he kept data on his doctorate, he deleted it on 22 December 2019, ten days after the official annulment. A record of his doctoral studies remained for a while longer on the official government's site, but it was removed later, too. Calls for his resignation continued. Some members of the opposition and various civil associations (like the UZUZ, Association for the Protection of Constitution and Law), continued to send motions to prime minister Brnabiƒá to sack Mali from the government. Other, like the investigative journalists editorials commented that we finally awaited at least one of Mali's affairs to be concluded, but asked what happens with the entire string of other, more serious, material affairs which followed him for years, some of which, indirectly, even caused fatalities (illegal acquisitions of various companies by him and his father, tax evasions, numerous of-shore companies, illegal acquiring and concealing of assets, participation in corrupt privatizations, money laundering, ownership of 45 bank accounts, illegal, night demolitions of objects in Belgrade). Political scientist Boban Stojanoviƒá said that Mali would surely be removed from office if he wouldn't be involved in major corruption affairs and obtaining large amount of funds for his party, reminding on his further affairs, like 24 apartments in Bulgaria and dubious businesses of his brother, but \\"Mali is obviously the person on whom the functioning of this government depends\\" and \\"he is doing important work for Vuƒçiƒá personally and for the party\\". == Later developments == Court building hosting, among others, the Administrative Court, where Sini≈°a Mali filed the complaint against the University's decision on his plagiarism Milka Babiƒá, spokesperson for the Administrative Court, confirmed that Mali filed the complaint against the Ethics Board's decision on 17 December 2019. The complaint has no effect on the possible postponing of the university's decision. Though the possible court's decision concerns only the technical and procedural aspects of the process, his intention to defend his plagiarism at court, when it was already confirmed by the academia, was described as pathetic effort. Professor Vesna Rakiƒá Vodineliƒá had an insight in Mali's complaint and confirmed that it is not tackling the plagiarism itself. She said that based on the law, the complaint should be dismissed, but since Serbia has no judicial practice in this matter, everything is possible. Professors Biljana Stojkoviƒá and Slobodan Prvanoviƒá agreed that Mali can't overturn the decision anyway, calling his complaint pointless and noting that this way Mali is the one actually keeping the affair alive. None of the professors are familiar with any previous case of plagiarism decision being defended at Administrative Court. Professor Karapand≈æa ironically said that due to Mali's denial of plagiarism, he will eventually have to write the book, where he will debunk in detail Mali's doctorate. He said that there are even more bizarre things that have been copied than cotton. He also mentioned publishing of detailed threats he received, misuse of the Security Intelligence Agency and interstate scandal which he kept quiet about so far because he wanted to avoid the politicalization of an academic matter. Karapand≈æa, who continued to dissect the doctorate, claimed that he has evidence that plagiarized text already crossed the amount of 40% and that there is more to be checked. On 31 December 2019, Mali announced that he is going to write the new doctorate \\"in the second half of the year\\", as he was thinking actively about it since the \\"unfortunate political decision\\". In the meantime, he added, he is preparing another exam for the management of the alternative investments saying he passed the first, though the pass rate was only 52%. Mali also said he previously acquired the CFA. Mali stated he always had lots of faith in his knowledge and abilities, that he is not quitting anything and that he will always fight. He was considering conditions for doctoral studies both in Serbia and abroad, saying he will invite \\"everyone\\" to go with him to the exams. In February 2020, daily Politika published an article on fake theses, after interviewing one of the ghost writers, who was familiar with the business since 2008 but knows some cases from the 1990s. It takes about 2 months to draft the doctorate but those who are more skilled or versed can compile it in a month. Some openly advertise their work on the Internet but majority still operates on recommendation, especially after the scandals broke out. They also write graduate and undergraduate dissertations, scientific works, etc. Minimal price is ‚Ç¨1,000. The client provides the subject and basic literature, while the rest of the sources are procured online by the ghost writer or \\"if we take a real effort, we go to the library\\". Special attention is given to the parts that mentor is paying extra attention to. The interviewee admitted having a guilty conscience sometimes, but if he doesn't take the job someone else would, and he needs money. However, he expressed his surprise with the complete lack of guilt by the clients. He divides them in three groups: 1) those pressured by their parents and spouses to get a degree even though they don't want to; 2) those who want to progress professionally and earn higher salaries based on the education coefficient; 3) those who are legit doctoral students and started the process, but were halted by other things in life and never finished it. On 25 May 2020, a group of 20 professors filed a complaint to the FON's ethics commission regarding non-academic behavior of Mali's mentor, FON's dean and all members and presidents of the various commissions who kept confirming Mali's doctorate through years: Milija Suknoviƒá, Ja≈°ko Ondrej, Dragan ƒêuriƒçin, Slaƒëana Barjaktaroviƒá Rakoƒçeviƒá, Milica Bulajiƒá, Nevenka ≈Ωarkiƒá Joksimoviƒá, Mladen ƒåudanov, Srƒëa Bjeladinoviƒá, Veroljub Nastiƒá and Milo≈° Krstanoviƒá. They also asked for the public reprimand of ƒåudanov, because he was member of two commissions. Upon receiving the complaint, the commission has 60 days to submit its opinion to the dean who can then accept it or reject it. Next month, professor ƒêuriƒçin was appointed by the Serbian Chamber of Commerce to head the jury which should declare the best student's doctoral dissertation for 2018/2019. That same month, the FON endorsed ƒåudanov's candidacy for tenure, as he is an associate professor. His colleagues from the FON defended him, saying he is one of better teachers, that students gave him an average grade of 4,88 out of 5, asked whether the professional career of the brilliant candidate should be destroyed and is he the only or the major culprit. ƒåudanov also defended his participation in the commissions, saying he is not guilty of anything, distancing himself from the plagiarism process adding that all of this is endangering his health, work and peace. Professors who filed complaint said that ƒåudanov's expertise is not an issue, but ethics and that he shouldn't be teaching at university at all. In July 2020, the university added a clause to the Ethics Code by which the members of the commissions can't be liable for the views they express or the way they voted during the plagiarism procedures. Rector Popoviƒá stated this will empower the professors' free convictions, independence and impartiality, but the professors who opposed the clause said that the commission members are now devoid from ethics and that it was specifically introduced to shelter those who participated in Mali's case over the years. In October 2020 ƒåudanov was given the tenure, with only one vote against in the Senate. Popoviƒá said there was no reason to punish ƒåudanov for his views, citing the newly added clause. == Aftermath == === Politics === In the end, Mali suffered no political or legal consequences. Same goes for all those involved in confirming his doctorate through the years. During the entire scandal, Mali even progressed politically, being appointed to head or oversee the bodies which either investigated his business affairs and scandals or disputed his various claims like the Ministry of Finance or the Administration for the Prevention of Money Laundering (APML). From the position of the mayor of Belgrade in 2014 when the scandal broke, he was appointed to the post of the finance minister on 29 May 2018, thus the APML becoming hierarchically subordinated to him. Mali continued to amass public functions and was appointed as the head of the Coordinating Body for the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing on 4 July 2019. In this capacity he presented the state Strategy for the Money Laundering Prevention, which was adopted by the government in January 2020. Already in September 2019 journalists and editors Branko ƒåeƒçen, Stevan Dojƒçinoviƒá and Aleksandar ƒêorƒëeviƒá, from three major investigative networks in Serbia (CINS, KRIK and BIRN, respectively), anticipated that Mali will stay in office even if plagiarism is confirmed. On the question by Olja Beƒákoviƒá, the host of the talk show Utisak nedelje, is there a chance that Vuƒçiƒá will let Mali down the drain as part of his exit strategy, ƒåeƒçen said that he doesn't think it will happen since various political and financial interests are so tightly entangled. Dojƒçinoviƒá explained that, as the key man of the [Vuƒçiƒá's] system, Mali is \\"as steady as a rock\\" and he most certainly won't be let off. Crucial thing about Mali is that he is one of the main experts for the grey economy in Serbia. He added that for the large part of his career, Mali was opening offshore companies and operated through them, and was hired and paid by the people who wanted to hide their assets. === Media === Milomir Mariƒá regularly hosts president Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá in his talk show ƒÜirilica. The academia described his behavior as shameful and unconstitutional while dismissal of charges against him by the prosecutor's office was described as unprofessional and confirmation of corruption After the official annulment in December 2019, the state media switched to mostly ignoring the issue. Ultimately, none of the media were sanctioned. Criminal charges filed by several media organizations against Milomir Mariƒá, the editor and host \\"Happy TV\\", were dismissed by the Higher Public Prosecutor's Office (VJT) in January 2020. Charges were filed by the \\"Slavko ƒÜuruvija Foundation\\", \\"Independent Journalists' Association of Serbia\\" (NUNS), \\"Independent Journalists' Association of Vojvodina\\" (NDNV) and \\"Association of Online Media\\", claiming Mariƒá's report on professor Daniel Sinani was causing national, racial and religious hate and intolerance, but also on a different charge of the damage of reputation because of the racial, religious, national or other affiliation. VJT's deputy prosecutor Nenad Stefanoviƒá replied there is no reasonable suspicion that the deed was done, or any other deed which should be prosecuted in official capacity within the jurisdiction of VJT. The charge on reputation damage was forwarded to the lower, Basic Public Prosecutor's Office, which has a jurisdiction over the matter. Stefanoviƒá's answer was actually just one piece of paper which lacked the necessary parts of the legal response, like the explanation or legal remedy. Investigative network \\"Cenzolovka\\", which published the news, was heavily criticized by the Association of Judges and Prosecutors of Serbia (UST). In the statement it was also said that the dismissal was legal, that is has an explanation but that they have no intention of educating \\"Cenzolovka\\" when and to whom the explanation will be sent. President of the UST is prosecutor Stefanoviƒá, the one who dismissed the charges, and in its statement, the UST said this fact can \\"only be impressive\\". The UST was founded on 4 September 2018, even though both the judges and the prosecutors already had their separate professional associations. Stefanoviƒá stated at the time that the UST will follow guidelines of the MEDEL, European association of judges and public prosecutors. However, already in November 2018, the MEDEL warned that the UST is actually a GONGO, formed by the government to confirm and justify opinions and visions of government officials. Colleagues of professor Sinani from the Faculty of Philosophy called the prosecutor's office unprofessional, stating that Mariƒá's behavior wasn't just shameful but against the Constitution and its Article 21. According to professors, the actions of prosecutor Stefanoviƒá showed that everyone who is socially critical and not follow the wishes of the ruling party becomes victim of the media prosecution and despise. They also concluded that this case clearly shows the intertwinement of the regime media, vulgar TV shows, subjugated and occupied prosecutor's office and politics of the ruling party. Sinani said he is not surprised at all by the dismissal and that he expected such epilogue since the \\"institutions are not functioning\\". He added that he won't meddle into the prosecutor's job: \\"He has his arguments and this decision will remain in his biography. Let him deal with it\\". Nevertheless, they all filed complaints and the Appellate Prosecution Office dismissed them all in February 2020. From the Appellation's response it was evident that the VJT reduced all charges to the damage reputation before forwarding them to the Third Basic Prosecutor's Office, without notifying the attorneys of the plaintiffs. Also from this papers the conclusions of the VJT became public, as they refused to disclose them previously. The VJT concluded that Mariƒá didn't show hate or intolerance to any nation, he simply stated his mind on an actual subject and that his words were taken out of the context, even though the show was aired live. === FON === Citing FON's handling of the Mali's doctorate scandal as their starting point for credibility re-check, Center for Education and Evaluation in Science (CEES) announced in May 2019 that journals published by the FON are dropped out from SCIndeks. The reason given is the faculty's \\"compromised ethical status\\". The ban includes all three journals published by the faculty (Info M, Management and YUJOR). The CEES also included in its decision a huge number of works and texts published by the FON professors in the predatory journals (91 work and 257 authorships in 3 years period only). They qualified the faculty's behavior in this matter as a \\"bizarre saga\\". === Belgrade University === Philosopher Judith Butler visited Belgrade University and supported students University was criticized for dragging the process for so long. When the scandal broke in 2014, neither the University, its Ethics Board, and especially the FON, showed no interest into solving the problem. University's decision to annul the doctorate in the end was, however, praised, as preservation of the integrity and ethical courage. Though the University corrected its mistake, saving its honor, reputation, dignity and autonomy at the last moment, it was harmed by the years of its servility and silent acceptance of the pressure form the government and the tabloids. The process was also described as the \\"five and a half years long stain\\". Rector Popoviƒá stated that the case of Mali's doctorate harmed the reputation of the university. Former rector said autonomy went down the drain five and a half years ago when Vuƒçiƒá said that plagiarism charge is the \\"stupidest thing he has ever heard\\". University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy issued a statement warning that the reactions of the government officials during this process further downgraded the reputation of the university. Tinde Kovaƒç Ceroviƒá, professor and former state secretary in the Ministry of Education, said that Mali, with his plagiarism and denial, inestimably damaged the entire educational system. Since he didn't step down, she proposed him to do raise the salaries of professors and at least do something good. Berkeley physics professor Jasmina Vujic visited students during the September 2019 protest, calling doctorate an obvious plagiarism and that 5 years long process damaged university's reputation so much that at Berkeley they are now cautious on accepting Belgrade University students at doctoral studies. Former head of the Ethics Board, professor Radmila Vasiƒá, confirmed that the reputation is damaged and that from various sides they get warnings that Serbian students are more thoroughly checked when applying for doctoral studies. Judith Butler, who visited Belgrade University few weeks later, supported the protest and said that \\"academic liberty is a political matter\\". In 2018, the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA) placed the membership of the National Entity for Accreditation and Quality Assurance in Higher Education of Serbia (NAT) under supervision. After two years, the ENQA concluded in March 2020 that the NAT remained under the influence of the government, instead of being independent and reduced the NAT's membership from full to the adjoining member. Government appoints majority of the NAT's Administrative Board members. Also, if the NAT refuses to give credentials to some school or university, they appeal to the National Council for Higher Education (NSVO), where majority of members are also appointed by the government creating a way of bypassing the accreditation body. While the government downplayed the importance of the ENQA's decision, some academia members stated that this might mean additional checks of the Serbian students who continue postgraduate education in foreign countries, but also that the demotion of the NAT is \\"the price for the tolerance showed by the both private and state universities towards the suspicious diplomas of the politicians\\". Government's majority in both the NAT and the NSVO, so as removal of the students' representatives from the bodies (another complaint by the ENQA), were achieved by the amendments of Muamer Zukorliƒá, which were then endorsed by the Vuƒçiƒá's ruling majority. Fake diplomas and titles, especially that of Mali, became regular part of performance acts in students' protests which in turn are part of the wider political protests in Serbia since 2018. === Plagiarism procedures === During the course of the scandal, several changes were made regarding the academic plagiarism. The Law on High Education was changed in 2014, with added obligation for doctoral dissertations to be publicly available. In July 2016, new codes were adopted at the university, which regulate doctoral studies and plagiarism, so as the new ethical code of the university. Though lack of the proper procedure was used as a defense of Mali by prime minister Brnabiƒá (\\"I ask both myself and those who are decision makers, if you retroactively decide based on the 2016 code for something that happened in 2013, does that mean you can judge retroactively any doctoral dissertation\\"), the plagiarism was always forbidden at the university by its former ethical codes. Rector Popoviƒá responded that there is no statute of limitation for plagiarism. In January 2020, the University adopted the 4th version of the anti-plagiarism code. Rector Popoviƒá said that number of reports for suspicion of plagiarism grew \\"in the previous period\\" and that, with new and simplified procedures, and acquirement of further anti-plagiarism software (like iThenticate), she expects further rise in the number of reports. She added that all decisions will be publicly announced by the University, in order to make the process more transparent. In February 2020, Popoviƒá said there were 9 or 10 reported plagiarized doctorates in the deliberation process at the University. On 19 February 2020, the Senate amended the code again, adding an automated termination of employment as the clear consequence of plagiarism. This is opposed to the previous sanction, which included only stripping of the academic title. The change was prompted by the case of professor Aleksandar Jak≈°iƒá. Among several other plagiarisms declared by the University in 2019, there was a decision from 9 October regarding the school book International private law by Jak≈°iƒá in which he plagiarized some 100 pages from German law professor . He complained to the Administrative Court which adopted his appeal regarding technicalities of the process. As Jak≈°iƒá was already sanctioned for previous indiscretions, the Faculty of Law fired him on 4 February 2020 citing damage he invoked to the faculty due to his plagiarism. On 18 February, the Labor Inspection ordered the faculty to hire Jak≈°iƒá again, as the inspector took upon herself to judge if Jak≈°iƒá's plagiarism damaged the reputation of the faculty or not, instead of checking whether the technical, formal and lawful procedure was applied. ==References== Category:Plagiarism ","title":"Sini≈°a Mali plagiarism scandal"},{"id":"63899971","text":"Wallace Prescott Rowe (February 20, 1926, Baltimore ‚Äì July 4, 1983, Baltimore) was an American virologist, known for his research on retroviruses and oncoviruses and as a co-discoverer (with Robert J.

Shushi Liberation Day () is a national holiday celebrated in Armenia and the partially recognized Republic of Artsakh. It is commemorated on both 8 and 9 May as a way to celebrate the anniversary of the Capture of Shusha and the Siege of Stepanakert (referred to commonly by Armenians as the Liberation of Shushi) from Azerbaijani forces in 1992. Being both former Soviet republics, the holiday also commemorates the traditional Victory Day celebrations on 9 May, commemorating the surrender of Nazi Germany at the end of the Great Patriotic War in 1945. The holiday serves as the official holiday of the Artsakh Defense Army, which was established on this day. Because of this reality, it is sometimes referred to as a \\"triple holiday\\". == Commemorations == The 2020 flypast. Many officials and veterans lay wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Yerevan's Victory Park and the Yerablur. Greetings are given by the President of Armenia and the President of Artsakh. === 2005 celebrations === The 2005 celebrations marked the 60th anniversary of the war. President Robert Kocharian was in Moscow during the celebrations to attend the Victory Day Parade on Red Square. === 2007 celebrations === The 2007 celebrations marked the fifteenth anniversary of the town's capture. The festivities included a cross-country marathon organized by the youth wing of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation that began inside Armenia and ended in Shusha on the eve of 9 May. In Armenia, the then Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan inaugurated a square named after Shusha. === 2020 celebrations === The 2020 celebrations in honor of the 28th anniversary and the 75th anniversary were cancelled by order of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A fly past of the Armenian Air Force and the Russian 102nd Military Base was held at the Mother Armenia monument. In a ceremony that preceded the parade, 6 veterans of war were driven to the airport, where they handed the banners of 6 Armenian Red Army regiments to the pilots participating in the flypast. President Armen Sarkissian hosted the war leader Arkady Ter-Tadevosyan at his residence, saying that he is \\"the symbol of Shushi Liberation Day\\". == Annual military parade == The Liberation Day Parade is the military parade in Stepanakert that marks the anniversary of the capture, held on 9 May. It is organized by the Ministry of Defence and usually lasts an hour and 45 minutes. The parade normally takes place every five years on Renaissance Square and it showcases the defense capability of the defense army. Over the years the parade was fitted to resemble the quinquennial Independence Day parade in Yerevan. The following parades have historically been held: * 1995 - The first parade in honor of the holiday was held in 1995, which celebrated the 3rd anniversary of both holidays. The parade also coincided with the golden jubilee (50th anniversary) of the Great Patriotic War, which was celebrated with military parades in all former Soviet republics (excluding the Baltic states). The commander of the parade was Deputy Commander of the NKR Army Major-General Seyran Ohanyan while the inspector was Defence minister Samvel Babayan. All orders and speeches during the parade were notably given in Russian instead of the Armenian language. Troops from all the Defense Districts and separate subdivisions of the Defense Army passed through the central square. * 1997 - This parade celebrated the 5th anniversary of the liberation and the 52nd anniversary of the victory. * 2007 - The 2007 parade was attended by Armenian President Kocharian and Artsakh President Arkady Ghukasian. President Ghukasian in particular, honored the anniversary of the Great Patriotic War by noting that Armenians appreciate the contribution of their ancestors who took part in both the Second World War and the Nagorno-Karabakh War. Ghukasyan also reiterated the point that the citizens of the republic would have the final say over their future in peace talks with Azerbaijan.Danielyan, Emin. \\"Karabakh Leader Demands ‚ÄòFinal Say‚Äô In Peace Talks.\\" RFE/RL.

It took place with the participation of troops and troops, as well as with the participation of a large number of foreign guests (from the United States, France, Russia and other countries). Contingents included those from the Kristapor Ivanyan Military College, veterans of the Great Patriotic War, and members of the Artsakh Freedom Fighters Union. * 2012 - Celebrated the 20th anniversary of the liberation and the 67th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War. The Band of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Armenia (led by Colonel Armen Poghosyan) and the Honour Guard Battalion of the Armenian Ministry of Defense (led by Lieutenant Colonel Sokrat Vardanyan) took part in the parade, with the band playing Azat u ankakh Artsakh (the national anthem) in the middle of the parade and the guards performing an exhibition drill. The parade was the first to use Nissan Patrol SUVs as inspection vehicles for the Minister of Defense and the parade commander. * 2017 - The silver jubilee parade also was held on the occasion of the 72nd anniversary of the victory. In addition, a display of weapons is held at Revival Square prior to the start of the parade. The Armenian delegation was led by President Serzh Sargsyan and Defense Minister Vigen Sargsyan. === Ceremonial music usually played during the parade === * Presidential Fanfare * Signal * Zangezur Stage * March of the Preobrazhensky Regiment * Jubilee Slow March \\"25 Years of the Red Army\\" * March \\"Defile\\" * Military March No. 1 * Military March No. 2 * Festive Yerevan March * Our name is Armenian Army * Den Pobedy * March \\"Parade\\" * March of the Pilots * Capital March * Erebouni == Yerkrapah Day == Yerkrapah Day (Armenian: ‘µ÷Ä’Ø÷Ä’°’∫’°’∞’´ ÷Ö÷Ä) is a professional holiday for all members of Yerkrapah–ù–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–∏ ‚Äî –ê—Ä–º–µ–Ω–∏—è, celebrated annually on Shushi Liberation Day.

Loewendick & Sons, also known as Loewendick Demolition Contractors, is a demolition company based in Grove City, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus. The company is the largest demolition company in Central Ohio. It has demolished most of the landmark buildings in Columbus in recent decades, including Union Station, the Ohio Penitentiary, the Christopher Inn, and the Deshler Hotel. The company was founded in 1929 by Sylvester G. Loewendick. Its business expanded during a construction boom after World War II, and was involved in numerous large demolition contracts. By 1988, the company was making $5 million annually, and had 100 employees, including eight Loewendick family members. The company is looked upon unfavorably by historic preservationists for its landmark demolitions, although others favorably view its salvage work, recycling, and work during fires. ==History== The demolition crew at the Columbus City Center mall in 2009, later made into Columbus Commons S.G. Loewendick & Sons was founded by Sylvester G. \\"Tedo\\" Loewendick. Tedo was the son of a German immigrant who settled in Newark, Ohio. Tedo was employed as a shop foreman and then garage owner for years, though in 1929 moved to demolition, tearing down several houses for material to create his own new house. Tedo also did some construction work; several of his buildings still stood in Newark into the 1980s. The Loewendicks owned a 25-acre farm near Newark, which Tedo's wife ran until they moved to Columbus in the 1950s. Tedo's son, Jim Loewendick, attributed the business's early success to World War II, saying \\"Adolf Hitler put the country on its feet\\". A post-war construction boom in Columbus lead to the development of highways and urban renewal, which created a need for demolition contracts. In the 1950s, Tedo dropped construction and began to focus solely on the demolition company, and with his three sons, began to operate in a radius of around Columbus. Flytown was replaced by the Goodale Redevelopment Project, and the historic Central Market was replaced during the Market-Mohawk project. S.G. Loewendick was significantly involved in that area in the 1960s. In 1963, the company demolished 300 houses, and in the following year they demolished 91 houses for the incoming Nationwide Children's Hospital, 50 houses for Market-Mohawk, and 104 houses for the new I-71. In the 1970s, Jim Loewendick's son died in a freak accident on one of their work sites. In 1974, Tedo died, leaving his son Ralph as the company president. By 1988, the company had a revenue of $5 million per year, owning two landfills, a roll-off container service for construction site dumpsters, and a tire shredder facility. Seven Loewendick family members and one stepson were part of the approximately 100 company employees. Tedo's grandson Dave Loewendick now owns the business. The family also owns Frank Road Recycling Solutions and Central Ohio Contractors. ==Demolition projects== Hartman Building and Theatre Loewendick has demolished Columbus landmarks Union Station, the Ohio Penitentiary, the Christopher Inn, and the Deshler Hotel. The company also demolished the downtown Columbus City Center mall, Franklinton's Veterans Memorial (since replaced by the National Veterans Memorial and Museum), a former location of the Columbus Africentric High School, and a Holiday Inn in the suburb of Worthington. The company also was involved in the demolition of the Beasley-Deshler Hotel, the Chittenden Hotel, Halle's, and the Hartman Theatre in Columbus. They were also to demolish the Beggs Building, since renovated as part of the Fifth Third Center. The company has been involved in dangerous work, including during or after a fire. The Dunhill Clothiers burned down in 1974, and the company hauled aways pieces of the building as it burned. During a fire in February 1977, the company had difficulty tearing down the building, which was covered in 3- to 4-foot icicles. During a fire in the Short North in September 1988, Dave Loewendick helped a fireman out of debris, just before a four-story wall fell behind them. The company won the \\"Highly Commended Award\\" in the World Demolition Awards in 2010 for its demolition of Columbus City Center. The company, originally involved in both construction and demolition, still focuses on reusing items, including salvaging architectural elements. In 2016, the company purchased equipment allowing it to begin crushing and recycling concrete. Its work in the third phase of demolishing the Veteran's Memorial (removing its foundation) therefore involved a 100% recycling rate. On average, the company gets 50-60 percent recyclable material out of their projects. Columbus mandates 25 percent, and the City Center demolition project mandated 50 percent. For that project, the company recycled 90 percent of the materials. ==Reputation== The Christopher Inn and Memorial Hall S.G. Loewendick & Sons is locally known, as it is the largest demolition company in Central Ohio. It has demolished most of the landmark buildings in Columbus in recent decades. The company offers tours of its facility to local students, educating on recycling; the company also offers the use of a landfill for firefighter search-and-rescue missions. The business's current owner, Dave Loewendick, is unconcerned about his reputation for demolition, envisioning a pile of rubble where office towers or shopping malls stand. In a 1988 interview, he expressed remorse over not demolishing the Ohio Theatre, saying \\"We were about six hours from having that building\\". He expressed interest in demolishing Columbus's Central High School, as well as Memorial Hall, a building next-door to the Christopher Inn his crew demolished. His car license plates read \\"Raze 1\\" and \\"Raze 2\\". The Loewendick company's work has been opposed by historic preservationists. The demolition of the Columbus State Hospital was opposed by a Hilltop preservation group. In 1976, the company's demolition of Union Station was approved after orders by Battelle Commons Corporation, which had been planning to keep and restore the station's arcade. The corporation improperly went forward with demolition, and only a single arch could be saved after a court order was handed to the demolition company. In 1980, S.G. Loewendick demolished the Monypeny Hammond building. It was purchased by Nationwide Insurance Company president Dean Jeffers in order to demolish it, contrary to neighborhood redevelopment plans and a unanimous Columbus City Council resolution for the demolition to stop. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Companies based in the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area Category:Demolition Category:American companies established in 1929 Category:1929 establishments in Ohio Category:Construction and civil engineering companies of the United States Category:Construction and civil engineering companies established in 1929 ","title":"S.G.

Goodrich was noted for her thesis, first presented in a 1986 book titled King Arthur, that the legendary monarch was not a myth, but a real person, who lived not in England or Wales, as conventionally understood, but in Scotland. In her interpretation, Queen Guinevere was a Pictish queen, and Sir Lancelot a Scottish king. Her scholarly methodology involved back- translating Latin place names found in Geoffrey of Monmouth‚Äôs Historia Regum Britanniae to what she believed to be their Celtic originals.Stewart, Jocelyn Y. (30 September 2006), ‚ÄúNorma Lorre Goodrich, 89: Shed New Light on King Arthur‚Äù [Obituary; Erratum published 7 October 2006]; The Los Angeles Times, Section A. Her findings have not been accepted by Galfridian scholars. ==Biography== ===Youth and education=== Goodrich was born May 10, 1917, in Huntington, Vermont, the daughter of Charles Edmund and Edyth Annie (Riggs) Falby. When she was 5, an aunt gave her a copy of Alfred, Lord Tennyson‚Äôs book The Idylls of the King, and set her on a literary path. Goodrich graduated from the University of Vermont in 1938 with a bachelor‚Äôs degree and continued her studies at universities in France, where she lived for many years and once owned and directed a school. ===Career=== She married Joseph Lorre and the couple had a son, Jean-Joseph Lorre, but they divorced in 1946. At the age of nearly 50 she earned doctoral degrees in French and Roman philology from Columbia University in 1965. The previous year, she had remarried, to John Hereford Howard, and began teaching French and comparative literature at the University of Southern California rising ultimately to an assistant professorship. In 1971, after an associate professorship, she became dean of the faculty at Scripps College, a women‚Äôs college in Claremont and one of the five undergraduate Claremont Colleges. After retirement, she became a professor emerita. ===Popular writings=== Using the pen name ‚ÄúNorma Lorre Goodrich‚Äù, she began publishing books for a popular audience in 1960, beginning with ‚ÄúMyths of the Hero,‚Äù an exploration of myths from ancient and medieval times. In it she wrote, ‚ÄúThe hero myth may be the one that has most influenced culture down the centuries.‚Äù By 1986, now professor emerita at the Claremont Colleges, she had turned her attention full-time to the legend of King Arthur. That year she told a Los Angeles Times reporter that she had discovered a void in Arthurian scholarship: ‚ÄúAll the books on Arthur have been on the mythology, the legend,‚Äù but not the history. (Of course, this was not true; many books had already investigated the ‚Äúhistorical Arthur‚Äù.) Goodrich traveled extensively in Britain and France and laid claim to having mastered several ancient and modern languages. She and her husband traveled to Scotland and followed routes laid out by ancient maps, unearthing clues to the historical King Arthur. She adopted the view that the 12th century pseudo- historian, Geoffrey of Monmouth had known that Arthur had not been in England, but in Scotland, but had concealed this unpopular view by listing the names of Arthur's battles in Latin rather than Gaelic‚Äîthe original Celtic language of Scotland. ‚ÄúWhen I finally figured out what he was doing, I translated the Latin back into Gaelic,‚Äù Goodrich told the Riverside Press-Enterprise in 1994. She then found that the names coincided with places in Scotland. (The conventional view has always been that Geoffrey was describing places in southwestern England or Wales.) Guinevere was a Pictish queen, Goodrich decided, and Lancelot was a Scottish king. Goodrich's books were infrequently reviewed in scholarly journals and generally ignored by academic authorities. (For example, neither Norris J. Lacy's The New Arthurian Encyclopedia (1996) nor Alan Lupack's The Oxford Guide to Arthurian Literature and Legend (2005), both of which are exhaustive, mention her works in their vast indexes.) One exception was Rosemary Morris's review of King Arthur in the journal Albion. Morris was scathing. She found Goodrich's work to be ‚Äúuneven and erratic‚Ä¶. It is so fundamentally unsound that one would take it as an elaborate joke.... For an Arthurian expert, reading this book is a nightmare: familiar details are there, but in the grossest confusion. Even a non-initiate will probably find that the book denounces itself by innumerable inconsistencies and logical absurdities‚Ä¶. She claims to be a specialist on the written texts (p. 27), whose difficulty she greatly exaggerates‚Ä¶. In linguistics she is lost.... Professor Goodrich regularly mangles the history, literature, and language both of the Dark Ages (which she does nothing to illuminate) and of the High Middle Ages (which she totally fails to understand). But modern critics fare no better. If they agree (?) with her, they are \\"brilliant,\\" but if they \\"disagree\\" they are insulted....‚ÄùAlbion 19.3 (1987), pp. 391-3.Another unflattering review is: Frantzen, Allen J.

On the one hand, it means the traditional Berlin cuisine of Berlin households with dishes such as K√∂nigsberger Klopse or Kassler and, on the other hand, often a rustic pub and snack kitchen, which has become increasingly international due to labor migration since the Second World War. Since German reunification, numerous top-class restaurants have also been added. ==History== Until the end of the 19th century, the Berlin kitchen was a simple kitchen, which emphasized hearty taste and saturation rather than refinement. In the 17th century, numerous Huguenots settled in Berlin and brought their cooking traditions with them. The Prussian-Protestant kitchen integrated these influences essentially through simplification. Typical ingredients were pork, goose and fish such as carp, eel and pike, cabbage, legumes such as peas, lentils and beans as well as beets, cucumbers and potatoes. What is striking ‚Äì from today's perspective ‚Äì is the frequent use of the noble crayfish, which made it possible to catch fish rich in Berlin in the 18th and 19th centuries. With the founding of the German Empire, Berlin became the capital of a world empire and the arrival from different provinces expanded the city's cooking tradition, and Berlin cuisine began to internationalize. Jewish and Eastern European types of preparation were added, which expanded the menu in the capital. In the 1920s, Berlin was one of the largest cities in the world. Numerous large hotels and restaurants offered different dishes. The Nazi regime and the Second World War of annihilation that followed put an end to this culinary diversity. While in the eastern part, as the de facto capital of the GDR, the upscale gastronomy almost completely disappeared and international influences did not appear for decades, the restaurant scene in the west recovered slowly from this break. The 6th-floor food hall at Kaufhaus des Westens The first restaurants for fine cuisine opened in the rebuilt City West after the war. During the division of Berlin, the delicatessen department of KaDeWe remained one of the largest of its kind in the world and is still very popular with city residents and tourists alike. The Berlin currywurst is said to have been invented in 1949 by Herta Heuwer from K√∂nigsberg, who was running a small snack stand in Charlottenburg at the time. In 1958, the Caf√© Kranzler opened on Kurf√ºrstendamm, which wanted to follow the pre-war coffeehouse culture. The caf√© established itself in the following years as a West Berlin institution. Due to the labour migration after the Second World War, the Berlin kitchen internationalized again. Turkish immigrants are said to have invented the doner kebab in Kreuzberg in the 1970s, which is now considered one of the most typical Berlin snacks. Since reunification at the latest, Berlin has been able to establish itself again as a metropolis for gourmets. Even in the former eastern part such as Mitte or Prenzlauer Berg, there are now numerous restaurants with international offerings. In 2017, there were a total of seven restaurants that were awarded two Michelin stars. Another 14 restaurants received a star. In 2017, Berlin was the city with the most star restaurants in German-speaking countries. ==Typical dishes== ===Meat dishes=== \\"Liver Berlin Style\\" * \\"Liver Berlin style\\" ‚Äì Fried veal liver with onions and apple slices on mashed potatoes *Eisbein ‚Äì Pickled Ham Hock *Currywurst *Kassler ‚Äì Salted and smoked roast pork *Roast goose ‚Äì Traditional Christmas dinner in many Berlin households *K√∂nigsberger Klopse ‚Äì Meatballs with anchovies and caper sauce *D√∂ner Kebab ===Fish dishes=== \\"Aal Gr√ºn\\" with potatoes\\"Aal Gr√ºn\\" (\\"Green eel\\") ‚Äì Eel in herb sauce * Rollmops ‚Äì Pickled herring filets * \\"Polish carp\\" ‚Äì Carp in gingerbread sauce ===Vegetable dishes and side dishes=== Kartoffelpuffer with salmon and cream horseradish *Kartoffelpuffer ‚Äì Potato Pancake, often found at Christmas markets, sweet with apple sauce and sugar or hearty with salmon and cream horseradish *Jacket potato with curd cheese and linseed oil * \\"Teltower R√ºbchen\\" ‚Äì caramelized and then braised turnips; served as a side dish with roast goose or duck, roast pork, Kassel cutlets, tongue or meatloaf *Sauerkraut * \\"Bratkartoffeln\\" ‚Äì Fried potatoes, served as a side dish or main course with fried egg ===Dessert=== * \\"Berliner Luft\\" ‚Äì (\\"Air of Berlin\\") White wine cream with raspberry sauce * \\"Mohnpielen\\" ‚Äì Bread pudding with poppy seeds * \\"Rote Gr√ºtze\\" ‚Äì Red fruit jelly ===Bakery products=== Berliner Pfannkuchen Berliner Pfannkuchen ‚Äì Lard pastries filled with plum jam * Berliner Napfkuchen ‚Äì Yeast cake with raisins * Berliner K√§sekuchen ‚Äì Cheese cake made from curd cheese mass with raisins and rum on a short pastry base * \\"Liebesknochen\\" (\\" Love Bone\\") ‚Äì German word for Eclair ===Beverages=== Berlin has a long brewing tradition.

(13 February 1821 ‚Äì 12 March 1896) was king or ohin of Elmina (Edinahene) between 1868 and 1873 and between 1894 and his death in 1896. Between 1873 and 1894, Kobina Gyan was exiled by the British colonial authorities for his pro-Dutch and anti-British position. == Biography == Kobina Gyan and his supporters upon his return to Elmina in 1894. Kobina Gyan was born in Elmina to Kobina Conduah, who became Edinahene in 1863. During his father's reign, Kobina Gyan was sub- king (ohin nadir ekyen) and acted as a prominent spokesperson for the Elmina community. When the enforcement of the 1867 Anglo-Dutch Convention for an Interchange of Territory on the Gold Coast of Africa resulted in a siege of Elmina by the Fante Confederacy, Kobina Gyan co-authored the August 1868 petition to king William III of the Netherlands, asking him for help and assistance. After his father was destooled in January 1869 for not opposing Dutch governor George Pieter Willem Boers's way of dealing with the siege of Elmina strongly enough, Kobina Gyan was enstooled on 15 July 1869 to succeed him. During his rule, Kobina Gyan initially relied on the support and advice of the wealthy and educated Elmina trader George Emil Eminsang. Both initially opposed the cession of the Dutch possessions on the Gold Coast to the British, which was being negotiated at the time. When it became apparent that the cession would go through, the Realpolitiker Eminsang offered his services to the British authorities taking over, while the idealist Kobina Gyan continued to oppose British rule. When the Dutch Lieutenant Governor Jan Helenus Ferguson arrived in November 1871 to effect the cession of the Dutch possessions to the British, he deposed Kobina Gyan. After Elmina was turned over to the British on 6 April 1872, and angry mobs went after George Emil Eminsang, the British colonial authorities saw no other way of establishing control rather than to work together with Kobina Gyan, who was reinstated as Edinahene by governor John Pope Hennessy on 8 May 1872. Kobina Gyan never flew the English flag given to him by Pope Hennessy and refused British payment of kostgeld. The new British governor Robert William Harley decided to test Kobina Gyan's loyalty by requesting him to take an oath of allegiance to the British on 12 March 1873. When Kobina Gyan refused, he was arrested and taken by boat to Cape Coast, before being exiled to Sierra Leone. Kobina Gyan's exile would last 21 years. With the assistance of Elmina District Commissioner Hendrik Vroom, who collected him from Sierra Leone, Kobina Gyan again set foot on Elminan soil on 17 May 1894 and was again proclaimed king. Less than two years later, on 12 March 1896, Kobina Gyan died. He was buried in the Dutch Cemetery of Elmina. == Legacy == Statue of Kobina Gyan in Elmina. Note that the dates on the inscription are not correct. Kobina Gyan is remembered as a principled king who stood up for his people.

He was a son of Wilhelm von Pourtal√®s (1815‚Äì1889) and Charlotte Luise Auguste Gr√§fin von Maltzan zu Wartenberg und Penzlin. His father spent a number of years in Venice creating a collection of Renaissance sculpture, which included works by Jacopo Sansovino and Andrea Riccio, and paintings by old Italian masters. His siblings included Louise de Pourtal√®s (who died aged 29 in 1879), Johanna Albertine Antoinette de Pourtal√®s (wife of Bernard von Jagow-Calberwisch) and Rosa Margarete Guillemette Mathilde Auguste von Pourtal√®s (wife of Moritz von Hohenthal). Among his extended family were uncles Count Guillaume von Pourtal√®s and Count Albert von Pourtal√®s (a member of the Prussian House of Lords who was appointed the Prussian Minister to France by William I and was succeeded by future Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in 1861). His family, who were originally Swiss, were Protestant bankers. The Pourtal√®s title was created in 1750 by the King of Prussia Frederick William II. He was also a cousin of Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, the Chancellor of the German Empire and Minister President of Prussia from 1907 to 1917. Another cousin was Count James Pourtal√®s, who previously owned the family estate and went bankrupt in the Panic of 1893. ==Career== Formal and informal military and diplomatic connections in 1914 with the Triple Alliance (brown) and the Triple Entente (green) Pourtal√®s was Prussian Minister to the Kingdom of Bavaria in Munich (under Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria) until 1907, and conducted diplomacy in the style of the grand seigneur, holding posts in Austria-Hungary, the Netherlands and France. When Pourtal√®s arrived in St. Petersburg, he came with seventeen vanloads of furniture. Pourtal√®s succeeded Count Monts as the German Ambassador to the Russian Empire in Saint Petersburg from 1907 (when Russia went into a coalition with Britain and France, known as the Triple Entente, and formed as a counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria- Hungary, and Italy) until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. While Ambassador, Wilhelm von Mirbach served as the embassy clerk. Pourtal√®s was deeply involved in the 1914 July Crisis, which was a series of interrelated diplomatic and military escalations among the major powers of Europe in the summer of 1914 that ultimately led to the Great War and started with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir presumptive to the Austro- Hungarian throne. Pourtal√®s handed Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Sazonov Germany's declaration of war. In his obituary, the New York Times wrote that Pourtal√®s \\"supported the official German explanation of the cause of the World War. He asserted the innocence of his country and expressed belief that the Czar had been forced into war against his will by the Russian war party. He believed that the surest guarantee of peace would have been an alliance of Germany, Russia and France, which he said the Kaiser and the Czar tried to accomplish. He was one of those who accepted the theory that England had been feverishly pushing a policy of encirclement of the Central Powers. ==Personal life== Schloss Glumbowitz He was married to Gisela Elisabeth Kordelia Maria Charlotte Maximiliane Rahel Josepha Gr√§fin von Kanitz (1873‚Äì1957), the daughter of Georg von Kanitz and H√©l√®ne Boniface Pauline Luise Gr√§fin von Hatzfeldt zu Trachenberg. Her maternal grandparents were Pauline de Castellane and Count Maximilian von Hatzfeldt, who spent ten years from 1849 to 1859 as the German Minister to France and who signed the Treaty of Paris in 1856 which ended the Crimean War. After her grandfather's death, her grandmother remarried to Louis de Talleyrand-P√©rigord, duc de Valen√ßay, 3rd duc de Talleyrand-P√©rigord. Her aunt Margarete was the wife of the Ambassador Anton Saurma von der Jeltsch. Count von Pourtal√®s died on 3 May 1928 at Bad Nauheim, Germany. ===Residences=== In 1824, his grandfather Count Karl von Pourtal√®s (who married Marie Louise Elisabeth de Castellane), a Royal Counselor, purchased the estate of Schloss Glumbowitz which included a classicist palace. Friedrich later owned the palace which he filled with \\"numerous works of art\\" that were gifted to him by his father.

It occupies the southwestern Iberian Peninsula, encompassing coastal lowlands and mountains in portions of Portugal and Spain. The ecoregion has a Mediterranean climate, moderated by the influence of the Atlantic Ocean. Summer temperatures tend to be cooler than other Mediterranean climate regions, and winter frosts are rare below 1500 metres. ==Geography== The ecoregion occupies the coastal lowlands and hills in Portugal and southwestern Spain, including the lower basins of the Tagus, Guadiana, and Guadalquivir rivers. The city of Lisbon is at the mouth of the Tagus, and the cities of Seville and Cordoba lie in the valley of the Guadalquivir. Other cities in the ecoregion include Cadiz on the Atlantic, and M√°laga on the Alboran Sea. The ecoregion is bounded on the east by the Iberian sclerophyllous and semi- deciduous forests, which occupies most of interior Spain and Portugal's interior southeast. In northern coastal Portugal, the ecoregion is bounded on the north by the more humid and temperate Cantabrian mixed forests. To the northeast is the Northwest Iberian montane forests ecoregion. ==Flora== The ecoregion's plant communities include: * Evergreen oak forests, with cork oak (Quercus suber) and holm oak (Quercus ilex) as the predominant canopy trees, and an evergreen understory of low trees and high shrubs that include Laurus nobilis, Arbutus unedo, Erica arborea, Ilex aquifolium, Phillyrea latifolia, Phillyrea angustifolia, Viburnum tinus, Cytisus villosus, and Myrtus communis. * Open-canopied oak woodland with an understory of shrubs, or savanna with an understory of Cistus ladanifer and other low shrubs and grasses, are common, and typically as a result of human disturbance (see next section).Ac√°cio, Vanda (2009). The dynamics of cork oak systems in Portugal: the role of ecological and land use factors. Thesis, Wageningen University, Wageningen, NL (2009) 210 pages. * Evergreen woodlands and maquis (high shrublands), characterized by wild olive (Olea europaea) and carob (Ceratonia siliqua), with Chamaerops humilis, Pistacia lentiscus, Phillyrea latifolia, P. angustifolia, and Myrtus communis. * low shrubland, known in Portugal as mato, dominated by Cistus ladanifer, alone or with Ulex argenteus, Genista hirsuta, and Lavandula stoechas. Cistus shrubland is common in areas of poor soil, and areas disturbed by fire, timber harvesting, and clearance for agriculture or pasture. Cistus is pyrophitic, and relies on fire to germinate its seeds and remove competing trees and shrubs. Natural edaphic shrublands also occur on special soil types, including serra on acidic soils, barrocal on limestone soils, and litoral shrublands on the seacoast.Filippi, Olivier (2019). Bringing the Mediterranean into Your Garden. Filbert Press, 2019.Ac√°cio, Vanda (2009). The dynamics of cork oak systems in Portugal: the role of ecological and land use factors. Thesis, Wageningen University, Wageningen, NL (2009) 210 pages. * Woodlands of stone pine (Pinus pinea) grow near the coast on sandy soils and stabilized dunes. ==Fauna== The ecoregion is home to the endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) and Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti). Both species live in and around Do√±ana National Park. ==Cork oak silviculture== The people of southern Portugal and southwestern Spain have developed land-use systems centered on cork oak (Quercus suber). Cork oaks produce a thick protective bark which is harvested for cork. Harvesting involves peeling the bark from mature trees, which can begin when the trees reach a trunk diameter of 70 cm, typically when they are 20‚Äê25 years old. Cork is harvested by hand with hand axes, and care is taken to minimize injury to the tree so it can continue to grow and produce more cork. Cork can be harvested every nine years from a given tree, and cork oaks can continue to grow and produce harvestable bark for 150 to 200 years or more. Industrially- usable cork is produced only after the third harvest, on trees that are forty years or more in age. Portugal is the planet's leading producer of cork, which is used for wine stoppers, flooring, sound insulation, floats, and more. In Portugal, cork forests predominate in steeper areas with poor soils unsuited to agriculture, including the mountains of Algarve region and the hills of Alentejo region. Most cork forests are on private land. In some forests the understory shrubs are cleared to reduce fire risk, while in others the understory is allowed to grow naturally.Ac√°cio, Vanda (2009). The dynamics of cork oak systems in Portugal: the role of ecological and land use factors. Thesis, Wageningen University, Wageningen, NL (2009) 210 pages. The traditional cork oak agro‚Äêsilvopastoral landscapes are known as montados in Portugal and dehesas in Spain. They have a lower tree density than oak forests (40 to 80 trees per hectare), and have an open canopy or widely spaced trees that resemble a savanna. The understory is kept clear of shrubs, and used for grazing animals or for growing crops, typically wheat, barley and oats. From the 1920s to the 1960s, Portuguese governments promoted large-scale wheat production, and many montados in the lowlands were cleared for monoculture wheat fields and to accommodate tractors. Since the 1960s Portugal has urbanized, and European and Portuguese agricultural policies no longer favor small-scale wheat farming. As a result, some small montado farms have been abandoned, and others consolidated into larger commercial farming operations.Ac√°cio, Vanda (2009). The dynamics of cork oak systems in Portugal: the role of ecological and land use factors. Thesis, Wageningen University, Wageningen, NL (2009) 210 pages. In Spain, the black Iberian pig is bred in enclosures but allowed to roam in the dehesas, where they graze on acorns. The pigs are slaughtered for Jam√≥n ib√©rico, and ham from acorn-fed pigs is considered the highest quality. The ecoregion's oak species (Quercus ilex, Q. lusitanica, Q. pyrenaica, and Q. suber) produce acorns at different times of the year, so dehesas with diverse oak flora can sustain more pigs. Trained pigs are also used to harvest sought-after black truffles from the roots of oak trees. In recent decades, interest in sustainable silviculture practices as a response to climate change and biodiversity loss has grown. Herdade do Freixo do Meio farm in Foros de Vale Figueira village, near Montemor-o-Novo in Alentejo, is reviving a form of montado silviculture. On the 600-hectare farm walnut, cork oak, olive, citrus, and other fruit and nut trees support grape vines, and provide food and shade to old varieties of pigs, cows, chickens, and turkeys.Vidal, John (2019). \\"Putting pigs in the shade: the radical farming system banking on trees\\". The Guardian. 13 July 2019. Accessed 17 May 2020. ==Plantations== Extensive areas of Portugal have been planted with plantations of Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) and introduced eucalyptus, mostly Eucalyptus globulus. Pine is used chiefly for timber and particle board, while eucalyptus is used to make paper. From the 1970s onwards eucalyptus plantations increased in extent, mostly replacing pine plantations. 20% of the area planted in eucalyptus is managed by timber companies, with the rest on plots, often small, managed by individual landowners. Mixed stands of eucalyptus and pines are also common, particularly in untended plantations. Eucalyptus globulus can naturalize and spread into areas with sufficient water.Silva, Joaquim S. (2016) \\"Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) in Portugal\\". Presentation to the In-Tree Conference, 2 Nov 2016, Ascona, Switzerland. Accessed 10 May 2020.

Algarve Daily News, 24 April 2017. Accessed 10 May 2020. In the aftermath of the deadly June 2017 Portugal wildfires which resulted in 66 deaths and 204 injuries, the government announced further restrictions, including a ban on growing eucalyptus in certain areas, fines on the unauthorized purchase of eucalyptus seedlings, and permission to plant or re-plant eucalyptus only in designated areas, with one half-hectare permitted for each hectare removed from areas deemed unsuitable.\\"Fines up to ‚Ç¨44,000 for planting eucalyptus without prior permission\\".

Within a year of the family's arrival, her mother died, and her father was left to look after the five young children. The family lived in Perth, where she married Thomas McHard in 1845, by whom she had four daughters. With the death of her husband in 1864, McHard, her children, her father and her two unmarried brothers, took up land near Balingup on the Blackwood River. After the death of their father, the two brothers and McHard continued working the property but with the death of R.T. Jones (a brother), she and her remaining brother moved to Bunbury, where she died in 1912. ==Collections== She collected from Blackwood River (1873‚Äì1895), Preston River (1876), Geographe Bay (1881), Busselton (1884), Augusta, Cape Leeuwin and York (1885), Bayswater (1887), Gingin (1892‚Äì1893), Victoria Plains (1893), from near the Murchison River (1894) and from Dardanup.

McHard / Mrs McHard / Mrs MacHard/ Mrs McHardy / Mrs M. Hard), while the website Bionomia shows her as having collected at least 2072 extant specimens, and that 12 of these have contributed to a recent (2020) scientific paper. The seven surviving letters between Mueller amd McHard do not indicate how McHard started to collect for Mueller, but it is difficult not to believe that Mueller's extensive advertising in colonial papers was influential. == References == Category:Australian women botanists Category:1825 births Category:1912 deaths Category:Botanical collectors active in Australia Category:19th-century botanists Category:19th-century Australian scientists Category:19th-century women scientists Category:Scientists from Western Australia ","title":"Mary Ann McHard"},{"id":"63901352","text":"The 1989‚Äì90 Towson State Tigers men's basketball team represented Towson State University as a member of the East Coast Conference during the 1989‚Äì90 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

It occupies the interior valleys and plateaus of the Iberian Peninsula. The ecoregion lies mostly in Spain, and includes some portions of eastern Portugal. ==Geography== The ecoregion covers the interior basins of Iberia's main rivers ‚Äì the Douro, Tagus, Guadiana, Guadalquivir, and Ebro. It is bounded on the north by the temperate-climate Pyrenees and Cantabrian mixed forests. Spain's interior mountains, which divide the various river basins, are home to the distinct Northwest Iberian montane forests and Iberian conifer forests ecoregions. Separate ecoregions also occupy the coastal lowlands ‚Äì the Southwest Iberian Mediterranean sclerophyllous and mixed forests to the southwest, Southeastern Iberian shrubs and woodlands to the southeast, and the Northeast Spain and Southern France Mediterranean forests to the east. ==Climate== The ecoregion has a Mediterranean climate. The ecoregion's interior location means a hot, dry summer. Winters are generally mild, and colder in the norther portion of the ecoregion. ==Flora== Plant communities include forests, woodlands, maquis shrublands, grasslands, low shrublands, and wetlands. The predominant trees are evergreen sclerophyll broadleaf species and conifers. Forests of holm oak (Quercus ilex) were once predominant in plains and valleys with deep alluvial soil. Over centuries these forests have been converted to agriculture, pasture, or maquis shrubland. Maquis shrubland is a dense thicket of tall woody shrubs and low trees, mixed with low shrubs, herbs, and grasses. Olive- carob woodlands and maquis are common in the southern portion of the ecoregion, and in canyons in the northern Douro and Tagus basins. Wild olive (Olea europaea) and carob (Ceratonia siliqua) are the predominant trees, with the shrubs Chamaerops humilis, Pistacia lentiscus, Phillyrea latifolia, Phyllyrea angustifolia, and Myrtus communis, as well as lianas and herbs. Forests of stone pine (Pinus pinea) and maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) are found on sandy soils and inland dunes, and on soils derived from silicaeous rocks. Stone pines provide edible pine nuts, and the maritime pines provide pine tar. Areas of the southeast and Ebro valley with limestone, marl, and gypsum-derived soils are home a mosaic landscape, with mixed forest of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) and holly oak (Quercus coccifera), open juniper woodlands of Juniperus thurifera and Juniperus phoenicea, steppe grasslands with Stipa tenacissima and Lygeum spartum, and low shrublands with Artemisia herba-alba, Thymelaea hirsuta, Ononis tridentata, Helianthemum squamatum, and Thymus mastigophorus. Extensive seasonally-flooded saline wetlands of Suaeda fruticosa, Microcnemum coralloides, Aizoanthemum hispanicum, Arthrocnemum glaucum, and Limonium ovalifolium cover areas with poor drainage. ===Agroforestry landscapes=== Traditional agrosilvopastoral landscapes, known as dehesa in Spain and montado in Portugal, are found in the western portion of the ecoregion, and extending into the adjacent Southwest Iberian Mediterranean sclerophyllous and mixed forests ecoregion. They include scattered cork oak (Quercus suber) and holm oak trees interspersed with agricultural fields, olives and other fruit trees, and pastures. Dehesas support wildlife as well as livestock and crops, and forest products like cork, honey, mushrooms, and wild game. Over the past century many dehesas and montados were cleared to create larger single-crop fields of grain and other agricultural commodities. ==Fauna== The ecoregion is home to small populations of Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus) in the plains of northern Castile, and Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) in the southwest. Year-round resident birds include the Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti) and great bustard (Otis tarda). The woodlands are a wintering area for common cranes (Grus grus), and a breeding area for white storks (Ciconia ciconia) and black storks (Ciconia nigra). ==Protected areas== 74,552 km¬≤, or 25%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Some protected areas include Guadiana Valley Natural Park in Portugal, and Sierra Norte de Sevilla Natural Park, Sierra de Hornachuelos Natural Park, Sierra M√°gina Natural Park, Sierra de And√∫jar Natural Park, Monfrag√ºe National Park, Arribes del Duero Natural Park, Lagunas de Villaf√°fila Nature Reserve, and Sierra de Mar√≠a-Los V√©lez Natural Park in Spain. ==External links== * ==References== Category:Ecoregions of Europe Category:Ecoregions of Portugal Category:Ecoregions of Spain Category:Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub Category:Palearctic ecoregions ","title":"Iberian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests"},{"id":"63901417","text":"Mental health advocate, author and coach Lorenzo Lewis in April 2020. Lorenzo Pierre Lewis, MPA (born May 8, 1988) is an American social entrepreneur, mental health expert, motivational speaker, adjunct professor, coach and community leader from Little Rock, Arkansas. Lewis is best known for founding and leading the Confess Project. == Early Life and Education == Lorenzo P. Lewis was born at the Hudson County Hospital on May 8, 1988 in Secaucus, New Jersey. Lewis was born to a mother that was serving a short sentence in a local jail. Due to the inability of his parents to properly provide for Lewis, he was raised by his aunt and uncle in a lower middle class area of Little Rock, Arkansas. Despite normal test results, Lewis was deemed by an elementary teacher to be ‚Äúa student who could not learn and was not competent in academics among [his] peers.‚Äù Lewis did not receive support for his behavioral and anxiety issues at school. Instead, he was sent to a juvenile facility in Pulaski County, Arkansas at the age of 9 known as Joseph Pfeifer Camp. This camp was designed to help at-risk adolescents to acquire social structure and positive behaviors. While at the camp, Lewis received guidance from a camp counselor that helped Lewis process his feelings of grief from losing his father the year prior. This was Lewis's first experience with therapy and it was a positive introduction. Lewis continued to struggle with academics throughout his adolescence. For instance, Lewis was held back in the seventh grade for poor academic performance and narrowly graduated high school. By the age of seventeen, Lewis ran with a local set of Blood gang members. At a high school event his senior year, a massive fight broke out between students including gang members. Afterwards, one of the gang members Lewis was affiliated with pulled a gun out on a random pedestrian. This incident was reported and resulted in a high-speed car chase between the police and the car Lewis was riding inside. Consequently, Lewis was arrested for having thrown a gun out of the window during the car chase. He was formally charged with a Class A Misdemeanor for a Minor in Possession of a Firearm and detained. Ultimately, Lewis was sparred serious jail time and was placed on probation. Lewis cites this experience as life changing and recognized that his gang member associates were not supportive of him during this traumatic experience. After over ten letters of rejection, Lewis began his college career at the HBCU University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. Lewis earned his Bachelor's of Arts in Human Services degree from Arkansas Baptist College and his Masters in Public Administration from Webster University. == Career == Lewis has displayed a strong work ethic since childhood. As a child, Lewis earned money by mowing lawns and raking leaves. He started his first job at the age of sixteen at a local Wendy's. Throughout his young adulthood, Lewis relied on public assistance and worked several low-wage jobs such as a packing receiver at Tyson's Chicken to support himself through school. Lewis is the owner and operator of L&J; Empowerment, Inc. L&J; Empowerment, Inc is the governing body of several entities such as The Confess Project. In May of 2016, Lewis founded The Confess Project, a national grassroots movement dedicated to building a culture of mental health for boys and men of color through capacity building, organizing, and movement building. To date, The Confess Project has reached over 30,000 individuals in 13 cities across the country including Louisville, Kentucky; Jackson, Mississippi; Indianapolis, Indiana, and more. Based in Little Rock, Arkansas, The Confess Project's efforts are primarily focused in the Southern and Midwest Regions of America. Under Lewis's leadership, The Confess Project provides several initiatives such as monthly empowering sessions, community forums, and webinars. The Confess Project has received national attention for traveling to barbershops and providing training and ongoing education for barbers to serve as mental health advocates in minority communities. Apart from advocacy, Lewis worked as a program eligibility specialist for the Arkansas Department of Human services and as a youth care worker at the Alexander Juvenile Detention center in Arkansas. Lewis has delivered talks at numerous venues including barbershops, universities and TEDx events such as TEDxFayetteville and TEDxPointParkUniversity. They typically examine toxic masculinity, mental health stigma and generational trauma. Additionally, he authored a memoir entitled Jumping Over Life's Hurdles and Staying in the Race that was released in January of 2020. He is currently an adjunct professor at Arkansas Baptist College. == Personal Life == Lewis lives in Little Rock, Arkansas with his wife and daughter Sareya. Lewis's mother passed when he was 21 years old. Lewis committed to Christianity in December of 2009 and became formally baptized shortly afterwards. He is a member of the Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, 100 Greater Black Men of Little Rock, and Prince Hall Masons. Lewis's talks typically examine toxic masculinity, mental health stigma and generational trauma. Lewis is also a licensed insurance agent and owns a small vending machine business. Lewis suffered several traumatic car accidents and robberies during his adulthood. Additionally, he is a car aficionado and was involved with several car clubs such as the Crown Vic Boys for five years. Ultimately, he won Best Car in the State at the Arkansas Grand Car Show. == Awards == Lewis is currently a 2020 Roddenberry Foundation fellow and was recently awarded a 2020 Echoing Green Fellowship. Additionally, Lewis received the 2019 National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Multicultural Outreach Award and the Richard E. Tompkins Torch Award from the Central Texas African American Family Support Conference. He has also appeared in O Magazine as one of eleven 2020 Health Heroes, on Jay Z‚Äôs Roc Nation during Black History Month, and on the Power 106 Players Club via Nick Cannon Mornings.

Julius' first musical teacher was his mother, who would sing and dance while he played drums. He went to St. Peter's Anglican School in Ikole and played in the school band. In 1957, after dropping out of school and the death of his father, he left for Ibadan to pursue a career as a musician. He worked at a bakery while playing the drums or flute with juju and konkoma bands. There was no music school in the area at the time, so the premier, Obafemi Awolowo, created one in his political party's secretariat. He spent time trying to connect with highlife musician Jazz Romero, doing chores for him hoping to garner enough favor for music lessons. Romero invited him to play with his band at a hotel in Ondo, learning his first chords on the instrument that he would become best known for, the saxophone. When Romero got into a conflict with a nightclub owner and walked out on a gig, Julius stepped in as bandleader. Not long after, back in Ibadan, he joined Rex Williams' highlife band. In lieu of formal lessons, he consumed as much music as possible, buying records of any horn-based music he could, but especially the highlife music out of Ghana which had become popular in Nigeria, too. == Career == In 1960, Eddie Okonta invited Julius to join his band. Okonta's was one of the most popular highlife acts in Nigeria, and together they recorded several songs, performing many gigs, and even opened for Louis Armstrong. He recorded his first single, \\"Igbehin Adara\\", with the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation the same year. But by then Julius was less interested in playing highlife than \\"to put traditional [music] that I started with, and add a little bit of horns and guitar, and then do my own thing.\\" To that end he formed Modern Aces in the early 1960s and began incorporating American pop, R&B;, and soul into the African music he grew up with. They played regularly at the Independence Hotel in Ibadan. Fela Kuti would attend Modern Aces performances, and Julius would sometimes bring him on stage to play. According to Julius, it was because of him that Kuti learned to play saxophone. He had his first hit in 1965 with the song \\"Jagua Nana\\", the name applying slang for Jaguar cars to a woman. On the success of that song they went on tour around west Africa. As new kinds of music became popular in the region, Julius formed new groups to keep up with trends, for example the Afro Sounders and the Evelyn Dance Band. According to AllMusic, his 1966 album Super Afro Soul was a \\"dramatic, highly melodic incorporation of soul, pop, and funk\\" which \\"made him a national celebrity in Nigeria\\" and influenced American music. In the 1970s, in post-civil war Nigeria, Julius was disappointed by the state of the music industry. The civil war had a negative impact, but so did the influx of Western music. With a vague sense that something was missing, he decided to travel to better understand production. He traveled through Europe first, and then went to the United States in 1973, where he decided to stay. He took up residence in Washington, D.C., formed a band named Umoja, and played in local nightclubs. A break came when Hugh Masekela attended one of their rehearsals. Masekela had split with his band, Hedzolch Soundz, and formed a new group with Julius, including some members of both bands. They recorded the albums The Boy's Doin' It and Colonial Man and went on tour, opening for high-profile acts like Herbie Hancock, The Pointer Sisters, and Grover Washington Jr. Over time, he met and played with several prominent American musicians like Lamont Dozier, James Brown, and The Crusaders. He says they noticed his distinctive style of playing the saxophone in a minor key, owing to the Ijesha way of playing. Though they were successful, he left Masekela on troubled terms, both because he wanted to be a bandleader again and because of disputes over royalties. He spent time as a session musician in Los Angeles, even taking an acting role in Roots: The Second Generation, before moving to Oakland in 1978. He had always been interested in film production, and once in the Bay area attended film school. He did not stop playing music, however, and met up with others regularly at a small bar, Michael's Den. Even while in the US, he released music on Nigerian labels, such as Disco Hi-Life in 1979, which John Doran called an \\"exquisitely balanced hybrid of languid disco and serotonin- drenched highlife\\". He began teaching his style of playing to local musicians and formed Ashiko. Though it gained a following, he got tired of being in the teacher role, leading an African band that did not have other Africans, and returned to Nigeria in 1984. He quickly began recording tracks for the album Dance Afro-Beat, leading him to put together the 18-person Nigerian All Stars band. The group started to go on a US tour with the Lijadu Sisters, but it was canceled after just one show because of a misunderstanding that led to the Lijadus never arriving. Despite his influence, he was not well known abroad until Strut re-released Super Afro Soul in 2000. It was followed by his 1972 album Orlando Julius and the Afro Sounders being reissued by Voodoo Funk in 2011. He began touring internationally and, in 2014, went to London to collaborate with The Heliocentrics. In the English music collective's analog studio in North London, they recorded new music as well as new versions of older tracks. Together they released Jaiyede Afro in 2014, which charted at number 13 on the Billboard World Albums chart. == Legacy == Lopa Kothari of BBC Radio called Julius a \\"legend\\" and Robin Denselow of The Guardian wrote that he is \\"one of the heroes of Nigerian music\\", a \\"master of the simple, stomping riff\\" with a significant influence on afrobeat music. Modern Ghana considered him \\"the last of Nigeria's titans in the highlife music genre\\". According to AllMusic, \\"few artists have been more crucial to the invention, development, and popularization of Afro-pop\\". == References == Category:Afrobeat musicians Category:1943 births Category:Nigerian saxophonists Category:Living people ","title":"Orlando Julius"},{"id":"63901420","text":"The Red Sea Fleet Command or officially Western Fleet (WF), also called \\" West Coast Fleet \\", is a regional naval fleet and one of the two main formations of the Saudi Arabian Navy, with headquarters at Royal Naval Base at Jeddah, Western Province, that is the HQ and home port of the west sea fleet command of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. ==See also== * Eastern Fleet (Saudi Arabia) ==References== ==External links== * Fleet Category:Red Sea Category:Naval warfare Category:Naval fleets Category:Military units and formations established in 1800 Category:Military units and formations of Saudi Arabia ","title":"Western Fleet (Saudi Arabia)"},{"id":"63901503","text":"Charles Callins was an Australian na√Øve painter from Queensland. He started painting in his sixties after retiring from a lifetime working as a compositor in the printing rooms of various newspapers. He is best known for his paintings of the coastlines around Cairns, North Queensland. His maritime paintings are characterised by unusual distortions of perspective and aerial viewpoints. Callins gained commercial and critical attention in the 1960s through his association with the contemporary art gallery Gallery A, in Sydney. John Olsen has praised Callins for his \\"wild eyed innocence\\" and his \\"wonderful sensibility of being Australian\\".Fay, p. 142 Works by Callins are held in the permanent collections of the National Gallery of Australia and the Queensland Art Gallery. == Biography == Charles Callins was born in 1887 at a railway camp in Hughenden, Queensland, where his father was a worker on the Great Northern Railway. In 1891, his mother relocated Callins and his younger sister to Cairns, following the disappearance of his father for unknown reasons.Fay, p. 135 At age 12, Callins left school and took on a position as an office boy working for the Cairns Times, then subsequently The Trinity Times. For the period up until World War I, he worked for several other Queensland newspapers as a compositor working on the printing press. Leaving home for the first time, he accepted a lucrative job offer which saw him move from Cairns to Atherton to work for the Atherton Examiner.Lehmann, p.38 While residing there he played cricket and football for Atherton. Later he moved again to Herberton and worked for the Wild River Times. In Herberton he took up competitive swimming and running. Callins returned to Cairns again, and there he won sufficient prize money from a running competition to buy a block of land for his mother. To finance the construction of a worker's dwelling, he returned to his old employer to work as a foreman. Throughout the period until 1912, Callins was also involved in competitive sailing. From prize money, he and a friend constructed an eighteen foot yacht, the Thelma, which they completed in 1909. They went on to sail the Thelma in many winning races. Charles Callins enlisted in the Australian Imperial Forces in 1916 under the name Charles John Callins and served in the 52nd Battalion. He was given a position in the barracks' cookhouse prior to shipping out to England.Lehmann, p. 40 After arriving in Plymouth he was injured in an accident, and subsequently developed a life threatening bout of bronchitis. When he was released from hospital he returned to the cookhouse briefly. After collapsing in the grounds one day, he was deemed unfit to serve on the frontline in France. He was discharged in 1918 and sent back to Australia aboard a ship from Belfast.Lehmann, p. 42 On his return he was offered a veteran's pension, but instead returned to newspaper employment at the Cairns Post. During the return journey from England, Callins wrote a letter proposing marriage to Helen Anderson, a Scottish woman he had courted whilst a soldier there. Anderson traveled to Cairns and the pair married at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in November 1920. They had four children, two born in Cairns, and two born later in Brisbane. In 1922 Callins was commissioned by the Cairns Post to write a series of nine articles on the history of sailing around Cairns. As he was an employee of the paper, the articles were published under the pseudonym 'Prudence'. The subjects covered included sea rescues, the history of sailing ships, and the leisure activities of various sailing clubs. In 1926 Callins moved with his family to Paddington, Brisbane. He took up employment with The Telegraph, mounting photozinc plates. He remained active in athletics and sailing and joined a mouth organ band which played on radio.Fay, p. 138 Callins sustained a major injury in a workplace accident in 1937. He was hit on the head by a piece of lead equipment that had become airborne. He was treated in hospital, but a fortnight later collapsed in a blackout. For the following four years he suffered from frequent headaches. The matter was taken to court and Callins was granted compensation. He continued working six days a week up until 1947, when he retired under his doctor's advice. He was advised to concentrate on water exercises and so became a voluntary swimming instructor at the Ithaca Swimming Pool. In the early 1950s Charles Calling took up painting. He died in 1982 at the age of 95. He had occasionally been receiving treatment for cancer at the Queensland Radium Institute.Lehmann, p. 44 == Career as a painter == Charles Callins was first inspired to paint some time around 1951 following an incident where he saved a woman school teacher who was falling off a boat. He made a pencil sketch of the incident and was pleased with the result. Soon afterwards he decided to make a painting of Green Island, declaring to his wife \\"If I don't paint Green Island and the Barrier Reef I will die and take the story with me\\".Lehmann, p. 43 Callins, unsure of what to make of his own creations, took some works to a local school and received encouragement from some teachers who told him to never stop painting. Thereafter Callins continued painting and sporadically entered local competitions over the next two decades. Brisbane gallery owner Brian Johnstone, after seeing Callins' paintings, offered the artist his first solo exhibition in 1957. In 1966 Laurie Thomas, the director of the Queensland Art Gallery, suggested to Max Hutchinson of Sydney's Gallery A to consider exhibiting Charles Callins' paintings. His paintings were exhibited there the next year, beginning a long association between Callins and Gallery A in which sales were frequent and collectors eagerly awaited new works. They were a source of inspiration for fellow artists and arts administrators; being acquired into the private collections of Jon Molvig, John Firth-Smith, Clifton Pugh, Roy and Betty Churcher, Tony Coleing, Janet Dawson, Barry Humphries, as well as by the Queensland Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Australia. Callins also gifted many of his paintings to public bodies such as colleges, charitable associations, hospitals, and also to celebrities.Lehmann, p.30 In 1973 he went to lengths to gift a painting to Princess Anne and Mark Phillips for their wedding. Gallery A facilitated the presentation and transportation to London and it was happily accepted by the princess.Fay, p. 141 In 1977, for Charles Callins' 90th birthday, a retrospective of 49 works were exhibited at Gallery A. == Subjects, technique and style == A significant portion of the paintings of Charles Callins illustrate the landscapes and coastlines around North Queensland.Lehmann, p. 28 In particular Fitzroy Island, Mission Bay, Cairns Harbour, and Green Island. They are autobiographical in the sense they were informed by memories of his sailing days when he lived in Cairns. A strong sense of the tropical North Queensland identity is often conveyed in his works through the inclusion of endemic flora and fauna; trees, kangaroos, orchids, birdlife. Callins is described as a birdlover. Works such as Unspoiled Beauty and Massacre, the latter showing the bulldozing of koala habitat, reflect the conservationist views of the artist. Callins also painted contemporary and historical public events, such as swimming carnivals, beauty competitions, and visits of the British Royal Family to Queensland. Beautiful Day (1965) held at the Queensland Art Gallery. Charles Callins combined multiple perspectives into the same compositions. Here an aerial view is combined with a frontal view. Callins has been described as an archivist and an amateur historian who loves the details of history.Warner, p.16Lehmann, p. 27 He always accompanied his large paintings with elaborate handwritten notes, and in works illustrating public events, newspaper clippings. These were often stuck to the rear of the composition board. It is likely that his foray into painting was only ever intended to serve a secondary purpose; to provide illustrations for his written records. In his seascapes, Callins would note down aspects such as his family association with the place illustrated, its geographical position, the time of day, as well as providing navigational advice on the hazards present in the water. Author Geoffrey Lehmann describes Charles Callins as an excellent colourist. Callins was aware of how to mix colours from his experience as a compositor working on newspaper printing. With the exception of his series of rose paintings, he used predominantly pastel shades. When painting the sea he would use different intensities of colour to indicate water depth. His seas are accentuated by little waves; strokes of white paint like sparkling wood shavings. Callins always painted the sky in first. His clouds are depicted as close and palpable, as if nearby sheep. Callins avoided painting shadows, holding the opinion that shadows would put unwanted darkness into his compositions. Callins' first works were painted in house paints that he had left over in a cupboard. Afterwards he painted in oil, as \\"no man who loves the sea would paint in anything else\\"; watercolours would be easily destroyed by moisture. Susceptibility to damage also caused Callins to shift from painting on canvas to painting on masonite. The artist wanted to ensure his memories would last the test of time. One of the most characteristic aspects of Charles Callins' works is his complete ignorance of the established conventions of perspective. Art critic James Gleeson considered the chief delight in appreciating Callins' paintings to be the way the artist invents his own solutions to technical problems of representation. In an exhibition review, Gleeson wrote that Callins \\"paints as if he had never seen a painting in his life\\". Like other na√Øve painters, Callins improvised his own way of transmitting lived experience into pictorial images. The results of which are either ingenious, beautifully direct, or so \\"devastatingly oblivious to the long established conventions that one feels an almost irresistible urge to laugh\\". Charles Callins's paintings have been described as employing a \\"bold and adventurous use of perspective and dimensions\\". He appears to have given no thought for comparative sizes and seems only vaguely aware of technical problems. Explaining this, he said \\"the perspective is in my own mind\\". In some paintings huge birds dominate over landscapes, in another, a foreground theatre audience appears as tiny figures before a giant person towering over them on stage.Lehmann, p.33 In Callins' seascapes, horizon lines are seldom straight, but instead are looped around the paintings as if showing the curvature of the earth from a great height. James Gleeson noted that the curved horizon perfectly conveys the effect of instability caused by a ship's movements, whilst another critic found Callins does well in capturing the rise and fall of tides and the tang of sea-spray. Australian artist John Firth-Smith, a collector of marine paintings, was influenced in his early works by Charles Callins. Firth-Smith compares the awkward shapes and forms in Callins' paintings to those found in abstract art and Aboriginal art.Warner, p. 17 Callins would also combine multiple perspectives into the same composition. In one work, a Queenslander house is depicted to show multiple verandahs from a combination of a frontal and an aerial view. In another, a swimming carnival is depicted from an aerial view, with the audience in frontal view flattened out onto its side. Distortions of perspective were also used to show what lay around the corner of a headland or behind and island. Callins' seascapes are characteristically painted from a gull's eye aerial view, while boats within the scene are depicted from a different perspective; sideways and upside down, bouncing around, tipping and tilting in a quilted effect. The high vantage point of the artist's seascape paintings is perhaps attributed to his working method; to paint he leaned over masonite that was laid flat on his table. == Selected exhibitions == * Johnstone Gallery, Brisbane (1957) * Gallery A, Melbourne & Sydney (1967) * The White Studio Gallery, Adelaide (1968) * Gallery A, Sydney (1970) * Powell Street Gallery, Melbourne (1971) * Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane (1976) * Gallery A, Sydney (1977) * Powell Street Gallery, Melbourne (1978) * Powell Street Gallery, Melbourne (1981) * Swan Hill Regional Art Gallery, Swan Hill (2004) * Campbelltown Arts Centre, Sydney (2009) == References == == Sources == * * * Category:Na√Øve painters Category:Australian painters Category:People from Queensland Category:1887 births Category:1982 deaths ","title":"Charles Callins"},{"id":"63901561","text":"The Northeastern Spain and Southern France Mediterranean forests is a Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub ecoregion in southwestern Europe.

It is also called as ‡§∑‡§°‡•ç‡§ú. ==More information and importance of Sadja== The following is the information about Sadja and its importance in Indian classical music: * Sadja is the first svara in an octave or Saptak. * Sadja is also the first svara of a raga. (Not always but mostly it is the first svara.) * The svara that is played on the Tanpura for the singer is Sadja. It is played to know that one is singing on the right pitch and octave. * Shadja is the base or basic svara. * It is fascinating to know that after one raga is sung or played, and when one more raga is to be performed, then the svara Sa is played so that there is no confusion in mixing of svaras in both the ragas that are performed. (Specifically in ragas of the same svaras but different Chalan or movement.) * The svara of Sadja is never Komal or Tivra, it is always Shuddha in any given raga. * It is said that Sadja is the basic svara from which all the other 6 svaras are produced. When we break the word Sadja then we get, Shad And Ja. It means that Shad is 6 and ja is 'giving birth' in Marathi.https://saxonianfolkways.wordpress.com/2013/01/30/the-7-shadows-of- shadja So basically the translation is : ‡§∑‡§°‡•ç - 6, ‡§ú -‡§ú‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ . Therefore, it collectively means giving birth to the other 6 notes of the music. * The frequency of Shadja is 240 Hz. The frequencies of the 7 svaras are also given below: Sa 240 Hz, Re 270 Hz, Ga 300 Hz, Ma 320 Hz, Pa 360 Hz, Dha 400 Hz, and Ni 450 Hz, Sa 480 Hz (Taar Saptak) ........ (and so on). Consequently, the Sa after the Ni of 450 Hz has a frequency of 480 Hz i.e. the double of the Lower octave Sa. * There are 4 Shruti's of Sadja. Previously the main Shruti not only for Sa but for all the other svaras was on the last Shruti but now it is considered to be on the 1st Shurti. For example, if these are the 4 Shruti's of Sa then, Previously this was the position of the main Shruti of Sa. ^ 1 2 3 4 ^ But now this position has become the main Shruti of Sa. * All the other svaras except Sadja(Sa) and Pancham (Pa) can be Komal or Tivra svaras but Sa and Pa are always Shuddha svaras. And hence svaras Sa and Pa are called Achal Svaras , since these svaras don't move from their original position. Svaras Ra, Ga, Ma, Dha, Ni are called Chal Svaras, since these svaras move from their original position. Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni - Shuddha Svaras Re, Ga, Dha, Ni - Komal Svaras Ma - Tivra Svaras * It will be fascinating for you to know that Sa is the only svara which cannot be omitted in a particular raga. So Sa cannot be Varjit in any of the ragas. Hence Sa is the most important svara in the Saptak or in the Indian classical music. * For some ragas where Sa is the Vadi or Samvadi svara, Sa is played repeatedly. But for ragas where Sa is not a Vadi or a Samvadi svara, it is still played repeatedly since it the main svara. * Ragas where Sa is the Vadi svara - Raga Malkauns, etc. Ragas where Sa is the Samvadi svara - Raga Kedar. * Hypothetically speaking, Sadja is said to be the Sakar Bhrama , Sakar Bhrama as in the three main gods, Bhrama, Vishnu and Shiva. Sa is made the acronym of Sarkar for showing the importance of the syllable Sa.https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-significance-of-Seven-Sur-Sa-Re- Ga-Ma-Pa-Dha-Ni-Sa-in-music * Sadja is said to be sourced from the cry of a peacock.https://adharashadja.wordpress.com/2017/03/21/swara-and- shruti/#:~:text=SHRUTIShttps://www.dollsofindia.com/library/raga_ragini/ * Sadja is associated with the planet Mercury.https://adharashadja.wordpress.com/2017/03/21/swara-and- shruti/#:~:text=SHRUTIS * Sadja is associated with Green colour.https://adharashadja.wordpress.com/2017/03/21/swara-and- shruti/#:~:text=SHRUTIS ==See also== * List of Ragas in Hindustani classical music * Svara * Shruti (music) * Chalan * ·πöi·π£abha (Re) * GƒÅndhƒÅra (Ga) * Madhyama (music) (Ma) * Panchama (Pa) * Dhaivat (Dha) * Ni·π£ƒÅda (Ni) \\\\---- Sa (svara) Shadja (Sa) ==References== Category:Hindustani music Category:Carnatic music ","title":"·π¢a·∏çja"},{"id":"63901670","text":"Lake Cronin is an ephemeral freshwater lake in the Shire of Kondinin as part of the Great Western Woodlands in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia located approximately east of the town of Hyden and about east south east of Perth. The lake is situated within the Lake Cronin Nature Reserve. ==Description== The lake is a semi-permanent freshwater lake located in goldfields close to the boundary of the eastern Wheatbelt near to where it meets Goldfields. It is one of the largest freshwater lakes in the region. Most lakes in the area are hypersaline but Lake Cronin has typical readings of 185 ‚Äì 1300 mg/litre total dissolved solids making its water quite fresh. The lake occupies an area of and is recognised as a nationally important wetland as is registered in the Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia. It is fringed by large areas of woodlands, mallee and shrublands that are more or less undisturbed but surrounded by lands cleared for agriculture, particularly to the west so that any original vegetation has been reduced to small scattered small remnants. The area's climate is semi-arid with hot summer and cool winters, but with reliable winter rainfall providing an estimated average of around . The surrounding landforms are a mixture of breakaways, woodlands, sandplains and salt lakes in valley floors which drain internally. The surrounding hills and ranges are part of a large greenstone belt that runs from north to south and also includes isolated granite monoliths. ==Conservation area== An area of surrounding the lake was gazetted as a formal Nature Reserve in 1980. It had been formally recognised for conservation since 1975 by the Environmental Protection Authority. The lake's wetland with is surrounded by a catchment area that is almost completely intact and is listed as a nationally important wetland. ==Flora== The area surrounding Lake Cronin is particularly diverse with species of vegetation containing 24 vegetation types, including 16 species of plant that have conservation value. The area is composed of sandplain heath communities and low eucalypt woodlands and mallees with species such as Acacia asepala, Boronia westringioides, Melaleuca uncinata, Eremophila serpens and Eucalyptus exigua. ==Fauna== The lake is an important habitat for many species of waterbirds including; grey teals, pink- eared ducks, Australian shelducks and black-tailed native-hens. The varied fringing vegetation around the lake and wetlands also supports a variety of species including the striated pardalote, western rosella and blue-breasted fairy-wren. In surveys conducted in 1988, 90 species of birds were found in the area. It is also home to a rich array of frogs with seven species being found here including; the summer breeding Neobatrachus centralis and Pseudophryne occidentalis and the winter breeding Helioporus albopunctatus, Lymnodynastes dorsalis and Neobatrachus pelobatoides. It is also the only known only locality of Denisonia atriceps, the rare elapid snake. Fifteen species of mammals are also known to inhabit the area, including the white- tailed dunnart, Gilbert's dunnart, Mitchell's hopping mouse and the western pygmy possum. ==See also== * ==References== Cronin Category:DIWA-listed wetlands Category:Shire of Kondinin ","title":"Lake Cronin"},{"id":"63901677","text":"The 2020 Hartford Hawks baseball team represented the University of Hartford in the 2020 NCAA Division I baseball season as a member of the America East Conference.

He was beatified as a member of that group on 17 October 1926 by Pope Pius XI. ==Life== Armand de Foucauld de Pontbriand was born on 24 November 1751, at Ch√¢teau de Lascoux in Celles, Dordogne, the son of Henri de Foucauld (1712‚Äì1775), seigneur of LascouxA fief of the parish of Celles. and Sibylle Marie du Lau d'Allemans. He belonged to the Pontbriand branch of the Foucauld (P√©rigord) family; he was the great-great uncle of Charles de Foucauld (1858‚Äì1916). He took religious orders and became canon of Meaux in 1774. In 1781, he was summoned by his first cousin (maternal), Monseigneur Jean Marie du Lau d'Allemans, the archbishop of Arles, to become vicar general. In 1787, he received the Abbey of Solignac, near Limoges as a benefice, being the last in the line of abbots there. ==Martyrdom== During the French Revolution, he refused to take the oath demanded by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, and \\"swear to be faithful to the nation and to maintain liberty and equality or die defending it\\".Bluche, F.

Its current design is a yellow, white, red vertical triband with the city seal on a blue field. Officially, the flag was adopted in 1929, although it is unknown if the flag was ever flown when it was first adopted. The city's first flag was adopted in 1912. The design consisted of the seal on a blue field. The second and current flag replaced this flag in 1929, however, an unofficial flag similar to the one officially defined in legislation rose to higher prominence. Instead of a yellow, white, and red tricolor, it had a red, white, and blue tricolor. It remains unknown how this flag came to be, but after this anomaly was discovered, the city flew the correct flag. The flag is currently in the redesign process. During the George Floyd protests, city mayor Andrew Ginther wanted the flag to be changed due to its heavy use of Christopher Columbus imagery. ==Design and symbolism== The flag flown alongside the American flag The chrome yellow, white, and scarlet red triband (officially a 1:2:1 proportion, but is often made a 1:2.3:1 proportion to fit the seal) is a reference to Spain, who funded Christopher Columbus' expeditions to the Americas. Columbus, the namesake of the city, is also referenced near the center of the seal, where a ship of his fleet is depicted. The ship is completely enclosed in a circular yellow border. Surrounding this is a shield modeled on the design of the Flag of the United States, with 13 red and white stripes and 12 white stars (6 on either side of the ship design) on a dark blue background. The city flag's dimensions of 10:19 are also related to the United States flag. Instead of directly stating the proportions, the municipal code of Columbus mandates that the flag be of the same proportions of the United States flag, which was specified to be 20 by 38 (often simplified to 10 by 19) in a 1959 executive order following the admission of Hawaii to the Union. Perched on top of the shield is an eagle with outstretched wings, yet another example of American symbolism. Behind the eagle is the dome of the Ohio State Capitol building, denoting Columbus' importance as Ohio's capital city. Just above the dome is the text \\"Columbus, Ohio\\" in yellow old English font. Encircling all of the seal's elements mentioned above are 16 yellow five-pointed stars and a half-wreath of buckeye leaves. The eagle is grasping onto a single yellow star, which, with the additional 16 stars, represents Ohio as the seventeenth state to join the Union. The buckeye leaves are another representation of Ohio, as it is the state tree. The seal, adopted in 1912, originally did not contain the blue field. On December 9, 1958, the entire emblem was adopted as the city's seal. Originally, it was only regarded as the coat of arms. The official description of the seal allows for some artistic interpretation, and thus different versions of it have been designed. The flag's design has been criticized for its celebration of Christopher Columbus, a controversial figure due to his violent tendencies towards natives and colonizers and for his involvement in the Atlantic slave trade. The city has been removing its references to the explorer; following the 2020 George Floyd protests, the city also announced it was looking into changing the city seal and flag, removing its reference to Christopher Columbus. ==History== ===First flag=== First flag, used from 1912 to 1929 The first flag of Columbus simply consisted of the current seal on a blue field. It was adopted on February 12, 1912 after a committee summoned by the city council chose it. This date is agreed upon by almost all sources regarding the flag, but one 1962 city publication noted the adoption date was September 12, 1912. The resolution adopting the flag read: ===Second flag=== Columbus's second and current flag was adopted by the city council on January 28, 1929, writing an ordinance declaring: It is unknown whether this flag saw any use following the resolution. In fact, very little is known about the origin of the flag; even the designer is unknown. ===Third flag=== Third flag, used c. 1965-1975 It is unknown when and how the third flag came to be. It featured a red, white, and blue triband, as well as different stripe proportions (officially 1:1:1, 1:1.3:1 was often used). The flag was flown at city council chambers at least as early as 1965, despite the flag never being officially adopted. This version of the flag can be seen in a stained glass window featuring Columbus landmarks, installed in 1965 in Trinity Episcopal Church on Capitol Square in Columbus. === Rediscovery and use of second flag === Kenneth Huff, a writer from the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA), traveled to Columbus in 1974 to take pictures of the city's flag. Under the impression that the 1929 version of the flag was the one used, he was bewildered to find a red, white, and blue colored flag. He contacted the city clerk's office, who conducted an investigation as to how the flag became the de facto flag of the city. No conclusive reasoning was found. A flag designed by a Columbus Police Department officer that followed the 1929 ordinance was presented to the city council in April of 1976, at least 10 years after the incorrect flag was first flown. For the United States Bicentennial in 1976, this design was reinstated with stripe proportions of 1:1.4:1. The current flag proportions of 1:2:1 were adopted around 1985, to fit the seal more comfortably. Also around the time of flag adoption, a new description of the seal gave it a blue field. In a 2004 NAVA survey of 150 American city flags, the Columbus flag ranked 72nd, or 3rd of five Ohio flags (the flags of Cleveland and Cincinnati are higher). In 2012, the 46th annual NAVA meeting took place in downtown Columbus. As with all annual NAVA meetings, a flag contest was held, which would represent the meeting. These flags usually contain elements that represent the host city. The chosen flag contained a white arc separating blue on the hoist side with red on the fly side. The arc formed the letter \\"C\\", standing for Columbus. The color scheme of red, white, and blue is the same scheme for the Flag of Ohio and the Flag of the United States. === Proposed redesign === Efforts have been made to redesign the flag, perhaps the most notable being \\"The People's Flag of Columbus\\", designed by Ohio State University design teacher Paul Nini. It is split into four sections by a white cross in the middle, representing the intersection of Broad and High Street. On the hoist, a light blue semicircle is tucked underneath the white cross, signifying the Scioto River and Franklinton Peninsula. On the fly side, 4 red stripes and 3 white stripes (including one from the white cross) symbolize the Flag of Ohio, as well as the seven city council members that make decisions for the city. In the center is a blue star, representing its status as the capital of Ohio. The Columbus Art Commission was tasked with redesigning the city flag and seal, following a request from Andrew Ginther during the George Floyd protests. No set deadline was announced for when the design should be finalized. ==Usage== Columbus City Hall The municipal code mentioned above also mandated that the flag be flown at Columbus City Hall, always below the Flag of the United States. Columbus Crew SC's 2016 away kit (known as \\"For Columbus\\") was designed using various elements of the flag. It used a yellow, white, and red color scheme, along with seventeen stars on the collar. A miniature version of the flag was also placed in the bottom left of the front side. The city's seal was placed on the inside of the jersey, behind the club's badge and facing the heart. ==References== ==External links== *People's Flag of Columbus official website *Flags of the World Category:Columbus, Ohio Category:1929 establishments in Ohio Category:Flag controversies in the United States Category:Flags introduced in 1929 Columbus ","title":"Flag of Columbus, Ohio"},{"id":"63901829","text":"View from the southeast (Units B, C, D and E) Monjukli Depe is an ancient settlement in south Turkmenistan, at the northern edge of the Kopet Dag mountains. Excavations reveal occupation from the late Neolithic period, starting about 6200 BC, to the early Chalcolithic period. The earliest layers belong to the Jeitun culture of Turkmenistan. The prehistoric settlement lies in an arid alluvial plain, which is bordered in the north by the Karakum desert and in the south by the slopes of the Kopet Dag. The mountains also mark today's political border with Iran. About two kilometers northwest of the site runs the dry bed of Meana river, where the modern village of Miana, Turkmenistan is located. The large Bronze Age settlement of Altyn Depe is located about 2km to the northeast. ==Excavations== The first excavations by Aleksandr A. Marushchenko took place in 1959, and were later continued by his colleague O. K. Berdiev. The results of this first investigation were compiled in a preliminary report. In 2010, the potential of the excavation site was recognized by :de:Susan Pollock and :de:Reinhard Bernbeck, and this led to five further excavation campaigns (2010-2014) on site. ==Chronology== The location is important for establishing the regional chronology, because here the Neolithic layers are followed by the Chalcolithic. However, in 2010, the subsequent excavations have found a long settlement break between the end of the Neolithic settlement (layers XV, 6200-5600 BCE) and the Chalcolithic resettlement (layers IV to I, 4650-4340 BCE).Reinhard Bernbeck et al., \\"A-II Spatial Effects of Technological Innovations and Changing Ways of Life,\\" in Friederike Fless, Gerd Gra√ühoff, Michael Meyer (eds.), Reports of the Research Groups at the Topoi Plenary Session 2010, eTopoi: Journal for Ancient Studies, Special Volume 1 (2011). Based on this, the \\"Meana horizon\\" was defined here, which appears to be limited regionally to the Kaka District of Turkmenistan, and precedes the Anau culture IA phase. ==Chalcolithic settlement== Layers IV to I were excavated over a large area. They contain standardized houses with a square floor plan, and pillars in the middle of rooms.Monjukli Depe. Architektur und Siedlungsplan. monjukli.net (archived) In the top two layers, an enclosed open space was identified, in which, judging by the animal bones found here, the banquets took place. In the lowest layer IV, a house with a wall painting was found portraying two persons, also featuring some abstract patterns. The residents of Monjukli Depes lived from herding and agriculture. Sheep and goats were dominant among the herd animals. Cattle, as well as their skulls, played an important role in the banquets. In so far as the wild animals, remains of gazelles and onagers were found. Barley and wheat were important in arable farming, with the analyzes potentially indicating simple irrigation. Very little ceramic was produced in the Chalcolithic Monjukli Depe. On a general level, there are ceramic parallels to the Sialk II / Cheshme Ali horizon of the Iranian highlands. ==See also== *Bactria‚ÄìMargiana Archaeological Complex *South Turkmenistan Complex Archaeological Expedition ==Notes== ==Literature== * Reinhard Bernbeck, Susan Pollock: Scalar Differences: Temporal Rhythms and Spatial Patterns at Monjukli Depe, Southern Turkmenistan.

His father was a priest from the District of Koshishta and his brother Andon Zlatarev was a revolutionary from the Internal Macedonian-Edirne Revolutionary Organization but later died in 1903 in conflict. Krastyu Zlatarev enlisted in the Bulgarian Armed Forces in September 11, 1881. He graduated from military school in 1884 and August 30 of that year was promoted to lieutenant and was assigned to the 13th Risa Infantry Regiment of the Bulgarian Armed Forces. === Serbo-Bulgarian War === In the Serbo-Bulgarian War he was given command of the 3rd Company of the reserves battalion of the 2nd Strumski Infantry Regiment. He fought near Slivnitsa and near Keltash and fought even when wounded. He was awarded the Order of Courage IV degree for these actions. In 1889 he was promoted to the rank of captain. 1 year later on February 25, 1900 he was promoted to major and given command of the 9th Battalion Reserve Regiment. On September 27, 1904 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In 1910 he was promoted to colonel. Three years later in 1913 he was then appointed assistant commander of the 12th Balkan Infantry Regiment. === Balkan Wars === During the First Balkan War he was colonel and commander of the 29th Yambol Infantry Regiment and fought in the Battle of Kirk Kilisse, near the city of √áatalca and participated in the Siege of Odrin. The regiment commanded by him later became famous for taking the Turkish fort, Fort Ileritabia. For his bravery in battle he was awarded the Order \\"For Courage\\" III degree. During the Second Balkan War he fought against the Greeks at Kilkis and Blagoevgrad. In 1914 he became the commander of the brigade in the 7th Rila Infantry Division. === First World War === Ten days before the mobilization for World War I Zlatarev was appointed commander of the 11th Macedonian Infantry Regiment. In 1916 he was promoted to Major General.

It was released on August 7, 2001 via TWI Records and Var√®se Sarabande. The album was Anderson's 37th studio recording and his first to be released on his own record label (TWI). It contained ten tracks, all of which Anderson took part in composing. ==Background and content== According to Anderson, A Lot of Things Different was a departure from some of his more recent albums of the time period. In a 2001 interview he commented that it was, \\"the most traditional country album I've done in a long time and frankly, I got better reviews on it from fans than anything I've done in a long, long time.\\" It was recorded at Sony Firehall Studio and co-produced by both Anderson and Rex Schnelle. The project was a collection of ten tracks which Anderson either wrote or co-wrote. Included is a cover of \\"When Two Worlds Collide\\", which was a hit for its co-writer (Roger Miller). Also included is \\"A Death in the Family\\", which was first recorded by Little Jimmy Dickens. At the time of the album's recording, Anderson had been contributing his songwriting to music that had become hits for other artists. Among these songs was \\"Too Country\\", which was recorded by Brad Paisley. Anderson included his own version of A Lot of Things Different. The title track would later be recorded and made a major hit by Kenny Chesney. In 2016, Anderson explained how he co-wrote the track with Dean Dillon. \\"When we wrote 'A Lot of Things Different' in 2002, I was at the point then that I could look over my shoulder and say, 'Golly, I‚Äôd do that different if I had the chance to do that again.' You gain wisdom,\\" he reflected. ==Release and reception== A Lot of Things Different was released on August 7, 2001 on TWI Records, but also in conjunction with the Var√®se Sarabande label. Anderson explained in 2001 that he enjoyed collaborating with the Var√®se label. \\"They're great in allowing me to keep the manufacturing and distribution rights through the website and fan club and personal appearances,\\" he said. Although distributed through Var√®se, Anderson self-released the album through his website and other facilities. \\"The major labels understand but one way to sell: Get it on the radio and put it in the stores. But today with changes in the marketplace and technology, there are many avenues that I intend to explore,\\" Anderson commented in a 2001 interview. Anderson distributed the record as both a compact disc and a cassette. Like his previous releases, A Lot of Things Different failed to make appearances on any Billboard album charts, most notably the Top Country Albums chart. The album was also reviewed by Allmusic, which gave the effort three out of five possible stars in their rating scale. ==Track listings== ===CD and digital versions=== ===Cassette versions=== ==Personnel== All credits are adapted from Allmusic and the liner notes of A Lot of Things Different.

At about 440 by 90 nm, it is the causative agent of the only sexually transmitted viral disease of any insect. It was originally identified in a colony of corn earworm moths established and maintained in Stoneville, Mississippi, U.S. and was found to be responsible for the sterility of those infected. The virus does not always cause sterility, though. Many moths are asymptomatic carriers of the virus. Infected female hosts mate much more than those uninfected. With more mating events, the virus spreads to several males. Fertile female hosts may also pass the virus on through their eggs. HzNV-2 is closely related to HzNV-1; it is likely that HzNV-1 is a variant of HzNV-2 which exists in a persistent state in infected moths. HzNV-2 was discovered in 1995. Originally, symptomatic hosts were described as being \\"agonadal\\". Then, the virus was given the name \\"gonad specific virus\\". It was later given the name \\"Helicoverpa zea nudivirus 2\\" because of the similar physical properties between it and HzNV-1, which had been described about 20 years prior. It is highly unlikely that the common effects of HzNV-2 on their hosts, malformed reproductive tissues causing infertility, would have been selected for establishing an ovarian cell line. It is more likely that those chosen moths were asymptomatic. Their common ancestor is believed to share a common ancestor with baculoviruses, a family of viruses whose natural hosts are decapods, arthropods, hymenoptera, diptera, and lepidoptera. == Pathology == The natural host of HzNV-2 is the corn earworm moth (Helicoverpa zea). The virus is spread to offspring through their mothers' eggs (Vertical transmission) and through mating attempts between adult moths (Horizontal transmission). Infected moths are referred to as either asymptomatic (AS) or agonadal (AG), due to the virus causing larvae to never form functional gonads. HzNV-2 is very common among wild moths, and it is very able to survive in host populations. === Asymptomatic carriers === Persistent replication of HzNV-2 in insect hosts make asymptomatic (AS), fertile carriers. Unlike baculoviruses, the productive replication of this virus does not kill the hosts. Instead, it causes malformed gonads, sterilizing the hosts. When healthy females mate with infected males, the offspring are infected through the eggs (transovarially). Typically, some of the offspring are infertile while others are infected, AS carriers. Whether or not the offspring is AS or agonadal is dependent on how much viral particle content they receive from their mothers. The amount of virus mothers spread to their children increases over the time of infection. In fact, most infected, wild female moths are fertile and AS carriers, and infected females account for up to 69% of all wild females. When they mate with sterile, infected moths are still able to spread the virus through mating. After mating, the virus productively replicates inside the females, which makes the viral dose increase on successive oviposition days. These abilities to spread differently through hosts that are both asymptomatic and symptomatic and that spread the virus vertically to offspring and horizontally to mates makes HzNV-2 very fit and able to coexist well in the wild with its host. === Symptomatic hosts === HzNV-2 is able to change the molecular processes of their hosts. Though infected larvae appear to be very normal, when they emerge from their cocoons as adults, they may be without gonads. This condition is described as being \\"agonadal\\". The reproductive systems of both sexes are malformed as appear as a large \\"Y\\" shape. Female hosts infected through vertical transmission often do not develop several reproductive structures, including their ovaries, bursa copulatrix, accessory glands, and spermatheca. In addition, their common and lateral oviducts are malformed and enlarged. Viral replication in female gonads result in hypertrophy of the oviducts and proliferation of the cells making up these tissues. These enlargements appear to begin as early as their last instar as larvae. The lateral oviducts of healthy, adult female moths areone or two cell layers; those of infected female moths have four to eight layers instead. These enlargements may increase virus production. HzNV-2 also causes the formation of a \\"viral plug\\" that prolongs their mating behaviors and serves as a source of contamination for males attempting to mate. Infected females also produce five to seven times more sex pheromone than those uninfected and attract two times as many mates. While mating, female moths will continue to call to other males, uncharacteristic of the species. Since the virus can spread horizontally through sex, this transmits it quicker. Infected males may grow to have small, unfused testes, no seminal vesicles, vas deferencia, or accessory glands. Accessory glands produce pheromonostatic peptide (PSP), which inhibits the amount of mating pheromones females make. Without PSP, female moths continue to attract more partners. The tissues needed for the initiation of copulation and the transfer of reproductive fluids during mating function normally. The lumen of the primary simplex of infected male moths is greatly filled with virus particles that they very likely transmit to healthy females without fertilizing them. == Genome == The genome of HzNV-2 is a circular double-stranded DNA molecule of 231,621 bp, making it the largest dsDNA insect virus. It has a guanine-cytosine content of 41.9%. It contains 376 open reading frames (ORFs) coding more than 60 amino acids. Of the 113 ORFs that are likely to encode proteins, 66 are on the forward strand of DNA, the other 47 on the reverse. All of these are evenly arranged, producing 29 clusters of 1 to 6 ORFs. The average ORF is 1.4 kb in length, though the sizes range from 189 bp and 5.7 kb. The gene density of HzNV-2 is one gene per 2.05 kb with a coding density of 68%. The HsNV-2 genome shares homology with 16 conserved baculovirus core genes. Since HzNV-1 shares all of these homologous genes with baculovirus genome and four more, it is very likely that HsNV-1 and HzNV-2 have a recent common ancestor and their common ancestor diverged from a common ancestor of the baculoviruses. 75 of the virus' 113 putative genes have poor or no homology to any other known genes, except with genes of HzNV-1. Of the 38 genes with homologues, 6 are involved in DNA replication, 4 in transcription, 5 in nucleic acid metabolism, 3 structural proteins. === Comparison to HsNV-1 === Both viruses can replicate in cell cultures, though only HzNV-2 can replicate in an insect host. The genomes of HzNV-2 and HzNV-1 are very similar, sharing a 93.5% sequence identity. Of the 113 putative genes, the viruses share 97 that are not overlapping or inverted. There is a 5.1 kb area at 174.7-179.8 kb region of HsNV-2 that has no equivalent in the genome of HzNV-1. In this region of HsNV-2, three ORFs are found: Hz2V008, Hz2V091, and Hz2V092. In total, 14 ORFs identified in HsNV-2 are not found in the HzNV-1 genome. None of which have been determined to share sequence homology with any genes of known function. === Genes related to DNA replication and repair === The C-terminal region of Hz2V008 has homology with the catalytic domain for integrase and recombinase, which has DNA breaking and rejoining activity. This region of HsNV-2's genome has similarity to the INT_REC_C conserved domain. This domain is related to phage integrase and bacterial and yeast recombinase. It also contains motif cores for DNA binding sites, catalytic residues, the active sites, and topoisomerase. The best similarity to this gene comes from monodon baculovirus and Gryllus bimaculatus nudivirus (GbNV), suggesting a possible common ancestor. The C-terminal region of Hz2V018 has homology to DNA polymerase. It has great similarity to the Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus' (OrNV) DNA polymerase and the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase type-B family (POLBc) conserved domain, which is linked with DNA binding, polymerase, and 3'-5' exonuclease activity. This region also contains the well-conserved nucleotide binding motif, K(3x)NS(x)YG(2x)G, at 842-853 aa and the polymerase catalytic motif, YxDTD, at 892-897 aa. The 256 aa long N-terminal region of Hz2V029 is similar to the C-terminal region of the SbcC conserved domain, a prokaryotic ortholog of the rad50 gene of humans which has ATPase activity and is a critical part of DNA double-strand break repair. In totality, the gene is 823 aa long. This gene is most similar to the GbNV putative desmoplakin and Spodoptera frugiperda ascovirus 1a SbcC/ATPase domain. The C-terminal region of Hz2V038 is similar to a poxvirus D5 protein and it has homology DNA helicase, essential for virus replication. The most homologous gene is found in the Ectoropis oblique nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV). Hz2V070 has the most similarity to the xeroderma pigmentosum G (XPG) enzyme, which is related to other enzymes playing roles in nucleotide-excision repair and transcription- coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage. === Genes related to RNA transcription === Hz2V028 shows homology with the baculovirus very late expression factor 1 (vlf-1), necessary for burst expression of the genes polyhedrin and p10. Vlf-1 is a transcription initiation factor that recognizes and binds to DTAAG, a promoter motif of baculovirus very late genes, though it is likely Hz2V028 recognizes a different motif. Hz2V040 is closest in similarity to Spodoptera furugiperda NPV lef-5. It has characteristic zinc ribbon motif for DNA binding, and it likely has transcriptional initiation activity. Hz2V043 most likely plays a role in mRNA 5'-capping and is likely able to from stable enzyme-nucleotide monophosphate complexes for guanylation, like GbNV lef-4. Hz2V051 is most similar to GbNV lef-8, which helps encode one of the main catalytic subunits of the baculovirus RNA polymerase. Hz2V063 shows homology to the N-terminal region of the nudivirus and baculovirus LEF-9. It may, then, have a part in RNA polymerase. === Genes related to virus entry === Hz2V026 is most similar to GbNV pif-2 and Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMPV), and it may form disulfide bonds and be a structural component of the occlusion-derived virus envelope. Hz2V053 is a homologue of baculovirus pif-3 and GbNV pif-3. It contains an N-terminal transmembrane domain. Hz2V082 is a homologue of the GbNV pif-1 gene and is very similar to the Spodoptera litteroralis NPV (SlNPV). It is likely responsible for oral infectivity through directly binding the virus particle to host cells. Hz2V106 shows homology with baculovirus p74 and likely mediates the specific binding of the virus particle to host cells by aiding the formattion of disulfide bonds inside its C-terminal transmembrane's membrane anchoring domain. === Genes related to nucleic acid metabolism === Hz2V035 is most similar to Bombyx mori thymidlylate synthase and is likely involved in the synthesis of dTMP precursors from dUTP. Hz2V047 and Hz2V065 are most similar to SlNPV sibonucleotide reductase large (RR1) and small subunit (RR2) respectively. RR1 and RR2 help reduce ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides in order to produce precursors of DNA. Hz2V066 is most homologous with the Bombyx mori serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), which catalyzes the reversible interconversion of serine and glycine with tetrahydrofolate. Hz2V067 is most similar to Drosophila melanogaster deoxynucleotide kinase (dNK). dNK catalyzes the phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleosides to yield corresponding monophosphates and it is a key enzyme involved in salvaging deoxyribonucleosides. Hz2V069 encodes a protein 350 aa long and is most homologous with Culex quinquefasciatus dUTPase. dUTPase helps minimize the misincoporation of uracil into virus DNA during replication, and it may be a key enzyme in HzNV-2 replication and latency in asymptomatic carriers. Hz2V093 is similar to HzNV-1 ORF65, and it may play a role in RNA capping while not being essential for virus replication. Hz2V111 is a homologue of Heliothis virescens dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and to herpesvirus DHFR. DHFR reduces dihydrofolate into tetrahydrofolate, which is necessary for DNA synthesis to take place. === Genes related to structural proteins === Hz2V062 is most similar to GbNV odv-e56. Hz2V089 is homologous to baculovirus vp91. Hz2V108 is a homologue of MBV 38K protein gene, which is crucial for nucleocapsid assembly. === Auxiliary and undefined genes === Hz2V007 is very similar to the Bombyx mori carboxylesterase (COE) and, to a lesser degree, Anopheles gambiae juvenile hormone esterase (JHE). This high similarity may mean that HzNV-2 can control the physiology of infected hosts through the regulation of Juvenile hormone levels and the level of gene expression occurring at different stages of their development. In addition, this gene more closely resembles a host gene than a viral gene. Hz2V012 and Hz2V015 encode inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) homologues. Hz2V023 shows homology to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), specifically Aedes aegypti adenylate cyclase. MFS is a group of transporter genes found exclusively in living organisms and this virus. They code for carrier proteins involved in uptaking and effluxing small molecules, particularly sugar and drugs respectively. This gene more closely resembles host genes than viral genes. In fact, an MFS gene has never before been found in a viral genome; it is found exclusively in living species genomes. The protein it encodes for likely facilitates the enhanced metabolism necessary for the cell proliferation in the infected hosts' reproductive tissues Hz2V034 is relatively similar to the guanosine monophosphate kinase (GMPK) and most homologous with the hypothetical protein of monodon baculovirus. GMPK transfers the terminal phosphate group of ATP and GMP in order to make ADP and GDP, a critical step in the biosynthesis of GTP. Hz2V039 has homology with the baculovirus 19K protein gene (AcMNPV ORF 96) and is most homologous with GbNV ORF 87. Hz2V068 encodes a zinc-dependent matrix metalloprotease (ZnMc_MMP) and is most similar to Acyrthosiphon pisum MMP. This gene most more closely resembles host genes than viral genes. It likely synthesizes zinc and calcium dependent enzymes to be proenzymes in connective tissues. MMPs are important in cellular differentiation, morphogenesis, and pericellular proteolysis of the extracellular matrix and other cell surface molecules. Hz2V096 is homologous to AcMNPV ORF81 (ac81) but is most similar to GbNV ORF14. Its function is unknown, but ac81 is considered a baculovirus core gene Hz2V099 is similar to a prokaryotic acetylesterase (Aes), a member of the esterase/lipase family that plays a role in the control of a transcriptional activator. Hz2V110 is homologous to serine/threonine protein kinase (S_TPK). S_TPK catlyzes phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues, which is important to cellular function regulation, particularly the phosphorylation of protein involved in signal transduction. The combination of Hz2V007, Hz2V023, and Hz2V068 may account for the malformation of infected tissues and the unique pathology of the virus. == References == Category:Nudiviridae Category:Insect viral diseases ","title":"Helicoverpa zea nudivirus 2"},{"id":"63902331","text":"Andy Warhol (1928‚Äì1987) was an American artist, film director, and producer who was a leading figure in the visual art movement known as pop art.

The show features two characters created by British children's writer Kenneth Grahame: the Reluctant Dragon from the 1898 short story of the same name, and Mr. Toad from the 1908 novel The Wind in the Willows. The show was created by Rankin/Bass Productions in New York City, who produced 17 episodes. The show was a flop, airing from September 12 until December 26, 1970, when it was pulled from the Saturday morning schedule. A year later, ABC aired reruns of the show on Sunday mornings from September 12, 1971 to September 17, 1972. The half-hour comedy program included three shorts on each episode: the Reluctant Dragon took the first and third slots, with a Mr. Toad cartoon in the middle. Written by Romeo Muller and William J. Keenan, the series uses a team of Canadian voice actors with Bernard Cowan as the recording supervisor. Tobias, the Reluctant Dragon, was voiced by Paul Soles; other characters were performed by Donna Miller, Claude Rae and Carl Banas. The series' character designs were done by Paul Coker, Jr., and the animation supervision by Japanese-American animator Steve Nakagawa at Mushi Production in Tokyo. ==The Reluctant Dragon== Tobias is a gentle, dreamy dragon who was cursed by the wizard Merlin with flaming breath, which comes upon him every time that he sneezes. He is a kind-hearted soul who doesn't want to hurt the populace of Willowmarsh Village, and is ashamed whenever he erupts in flame. He's regularly troubled by a little blonde girl who wants to give him a bouquet of daisies, which make him sneeze. Tobias is aided by a knight, Sir Malcolm Giles, who tries to protect both the village and the dragon. Willowmarsh is ruled by King Herman, who hosts a variety show. Other characters include Sir Andrew, Irving the Bold and Ugliola. Titles of the Reluctant Dragon cartoons included \\"National Daisy Week\\", \\"The Campscout Girls', \\"A Cold Day in Wilowmarsh\\", \\"The Tobias Touch\\" and \\"Tobias, the Reluctant Viking\\". ==Mr. Toad== J. Thaddeus Toad is a gadabout playboy who likes driving fast cars and wearing expensive clothes. He's the wealthy owner of Toad Hall, and an object of ridicule among his friends ‚Äî the timid Mole, intellectual Badger and outgoing Water Rat. Mr. Toad stories included \\"Ghost of Toad Hall\\", \\"Micemaster Road\\", \\"Build a Better Bungalow\\", \\"Polo Panic\\" and \\"Jove! What a Day\\".

Built atop a rocky vantage point known as the \\"Cloef\\", it offers visitors views of the Saarschleife. The major Saarland tourist attraction is operated by \\"Erlebnis Akademie AG.\\" == Structure == At 1,250 meters long, the treetop walkway winds its way to an observation tower that was constructed over the Cloef. The path is at a height of up to 23 m and has a minimum width of 2.5 meters. A series of four information stations along the path inform the visitor about quartzite, the beechwood forest, the Saarschleife, and wood debris, while children have access to a specially designed bridge and slide. The path winds its way to the top of the tower with rest areas along the way. By design, the path is completely handicap accessible with a maximum grade of a mere 6%. The pathway is open all-year apart from December 24 with only adjustments to its opening hours according to the time of year. The observation tour closes when wind speeds exceed 50 kmh. == Construction and opening == The treetop walk was built by Erlebnis Akademie AG from Bad K√∂tzting thanks to a community initiative by Mettlach. The total cost for the project amounted to 4.7 million Euros including a contribution by Saarland of 275,000 Euros. The European Regional Development Funds also proved to be a key partner in the project. The treetrop walk is a member of EUROPARC Deutschland and has been recognized as a distinguished national landscape. The treetop walk is made of 80% wood which required the use of 1,000 cubic meters of Douglas and larch wood as well as 100 tons of steel during construction. The project's realization also came with criticism. Many critics believed that the observation tower would mar the surrounding landscape and nature - particularly on account of the area's special meaning for Saarland and its wide visibility. However, the Mettlach town council approved the project with a significant majority because of the tourism increase it promised to bring. The walkway was officially opened on July 23, 2016 and had attracted its 25,000th visitor within three weeks. == References == == External links == * Category:Saarland Category:Tourist attractions in Saarland Category:Buildings and structures in Saarland Category:2010s architecture Category:Buildings and structures completed in 2016 Category:Forestry ","title":"Treetop Walk Saarschleife"},{"id":"63902497","text":"Calliphara excellens is a jewel bug in the family Scutelleridae.

Winters are cold, particularly at higher elevations. ==Flora== The plant communities in the ecoregion vary with elevation and soils. Evergreen broadleaf sclerophyllous trees, typical of Mediterranean lowland forests, predominate on low foothills and in river canyons. These include holm oak (Quercus ilex ballota), Olive (Olea europaea), and Pistacia terebinthus. Riparian areas with year-round moisture are refuges for Celtis australis and other less drought-adapted trees. Forests of deciduous oaks, including Quercus pyrenaica and Quercus faginea, are predominant at middle and higher elevations. On dry and rocky slopes, forests of Pinus pinaster grow in pure stands, or mixed with deciduous oaks. Woodlands of juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus) are found on high rocky outcrops. ==Fauna== The ecoregion is home to the Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus). In 2014, rare wild Retuerta horses were released in the Campanarios de Azaba Biological Reserve in Salamanca Province near the border with Portugal, in the southern part of the ecoregion. The reserve is owned by Fundaci√≥n Naturaleza y Hombre, a Spanish conservation NGO. Retuerta horses were once widespread in Iberia, but over centuries have been reduced to a single small population in Do√±ana National Park in southwestern Spain.\\"Rare Horses Released In Spain As Part Of 'Rewilding' Effort\\".

Hardly any members of this gens are mentioned by ancient writers, for the Spurilius mentioned in some manuscripts of Livy as tribune of the plebs in 422 BC is amended by some authorities to \\"Spurius Icilius\\", while it is uncertain whether the moneyer who issued denarii in 139 BC was named Spurius, Spurilius, or Spurinna. Nevertheless, a number of Spurilii are known from inscriptions.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 897 (\\"Spurilia Gens\\").PW, \\"Ti. Spurilius\\".Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, p. 263. ==Origin== The nomen Spurilius is formed from the praenomen Spurius, using the diminutive suffix ', which was frequently used to form new gentilicia from existing names.Chase, pp. 122, 123. Spurius was a common name in the early period of Roman history, and favoured by a number of prominent families, but became scarcer toward the end of the Republic, probably due to confusion with the adjective spurius, \\"illegitimate\\". The origin and meaning of Spurius is uncertain, but Deecke proposes that the name is of Etruscan derivation, and might have meant something akin to \\"city dweller\\", being synonymous with the Latin praenomen Publius.Deecke, \\"Der Dativ Larœëiale\\", p. 43. ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Spurilii were Gaius, Lucius, and Marcus, the three most common names at all periods of Roman history. Aulus and Tiberius represent early, but very uncertain cases, since the individuals bearing them may not actually have belonged to the Spurilia gens. ==Members== * Tiberius Spurilius or Spurillius, amended by some authorities to Spurius Icilius, was a cavalry commander under the consul Gaius Sempronius Atratinus in 423 BC. As Sempronius was threatened with prosecution for his conduct of the war against the Volsci, Spurilius and three of his brothers-in-arms, Tiberius Antistius, Marcus Asellius, and Sextus Tempanius, were elected tribune of the plebs for the following year, in order to protect Sempronius.Livy, iv. 42.Valerius Maximus, vi. 5. ¬ß 2.Broughton, vol.

It does business in Ohio, Florida, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. It is considered a mid-sized bank overall and is a member of the Mid-Sized Bank Coalition of America. It has significant operations in Ohio and Florida. In addition, it owns properties in several states, including Ohio, Illinois, New York, and Florida, though most of its is centered on Ohio. It lends funds to people to buy homes in 25 states as of 2019. It is headquartered in the Cleveland neighborhood of Broadway-Slavic Village. Its current CEO is Marc A. Stefanski, the son of Ben S. Stefanski, the association's founder and long time president. It holds over 11 billion in assets as of 2019.https://www.thirdfederal.com/our-advantage/history-value It has over 40 branches and is traded on the NASDAQ as TFSL. It has held the highest rating possible from Bauer Financial, which is a banking industry rating service in Coral Gables. TFSL has held this rating since 1994. It was also named Best In- State Bank at #90 by Forbes in 2019, ahead of major player KeyCorp at #97. In recent years, TFSL has been instrumental in trying to revitalize the once desolate Cleveland neighborhood of Slavic Village. It has pumped millions into properties and lending there. As an anchor in the Slavic Village neighborhood since its founding in 1938, devoted more time and energy to supporting programs in education and housing to stop the slide of the neighborhood and support redevelopment efforts. Trailside Slavic Village, a housing complex of new homes in the inner city, saw the company as developer. Phase I of the complex broke ground in 2013 and is fully sold. Phase II was developed and sold out in 2018. Plans for Phase III are currently underway. Through The Third Federal Foundation, the MyCom Broadway P-16 program was developed, bringing together non-profits, government agencies, and businesses to support education in the Slavic Village neighborhood. The program supports children and families through wraparound services essential to school success. In the last several years, schools in the neighborhood have gone from failing to passing grades in state testing They have been criticized for being slow to utilize mobile technology to reach their wide customer base, thereby lagging behind bigger competitors in the markets it serves. Still an important asset to Cleveland, it has consistently been named one of the best banks in the city and state ==Founding== On May 7, 1938, Ben S. Stefanski and his wife Gerome began operations with $50,000 in capital and its first president was Wladyslaw J. Nowak. At the time, the association was provided with the 50,000 to start the savings and loan with help from the Slavic Village community which is just west of the Bank's HQ. Initially, the organization focused on immigrant families, mostly Polish but soon expanded their clientele. The company has remained in its 1938 neighborhood since its founding but has expanded to operating offices in southern Ohio and Florida. Stefanski once said that he believed he was \\"Helping the working man attain a home of his own.\\" Mr. Stefanski retired in 1987, at which time his son Marc was appointed CEO, a position he holds today.https://www.cleveland.com/business/2017/07/after_30_years_as_ceo_of_third.html?fbclid=IwAR0fTAdZvZCT797mhrpJdas- TuqBwgNCHUFA_gc7gmzQ9cfmBENKeGjPowo#incart_2box_business ==Headquarters== The headquarters sits at the prominent intersection at 7007 Broadway Avenue.

The headquarters still sits on the ground where the company was founded in 1938, at the corner of Broadway and Forman avenues. The complex can be reached by taking the I-77 Fleet Avenue exit. ==Housing Market Crisis== In 2008, Cleveland's Slavic Village was Ground Zero for the mortgage crisis. A once immigrant neighborhood had fallen victim to sub-prime lenders and mortgage brokers who sold, then resold houses for mortgages never to be repaid, by landlords who would never see the homes prior to purchase, or even after. During that time, when other large banks and lenders accepted government- backed TARP funding to stay afloat, Third Federal relied on the company's strong capital position, and customers who continued to pay their mortgages during that time . ==Bank History Timeline== * 1938 - Founded in Cleveland by Ben S.

Producers, semi-fabricators, consumers, recyclers, and merchants can use Aluminium futures contracts to hedge Aluminium price risks and to reference prices. Notable companies that use LME Aluminium contracts to hedge Aluminium prices include General Moters, Boeing, and Alcoa. As of late 2019, the system of LME Aluminium contracts is associated with 1.27 to 1.49 million tonnes of physical primary Aluminium stored in 500 to 700 warehouses around the world, out of 2.78 million tonnes of global reported warehoused Aluminium, and 11.78 million tonnes of global reported and unreported warehoused Aluminium. For comparison, world production of primary Aluminium in 2019 is 63.70 tonnes, which implies that physical Aluminium tied up in the LME warehouse system for LME Aluminium contracts only makes up between 2.0% to 2.3% of world annual production. Despite the low amount of physical Aluminium tied to the LME contracts, they have become an important source of hedging and price discovery. ==Contract description== LME Aluminium contracts trade on the London Metal Exchange, which introduced them in 1978. The contracts require physical delivery of the asset for settlement, and deliverable assets for the contracts are 25 tonnes of high grade primary Aluminium. The contracts prices are quoted in US dollars per tonne. LME prices have minimum tick sizes of $0.50 per tonne (or $12.50 for one contract) for open outcry trading in the LME Ring and electronic trading on LMEselect, while minimum tick sizes are reduced for inter-office telephone trading to $0.01 per tonne (or $0.50 for one contract). Carry trades involving Aluminium futures also have reduced minimum tick sizes at $0.01 per tonne. Contracts are organized along LME's prompt date (or delivery date) structure. ===Prompt date structure=== LME offers three groups of LME Aluminium contracts with daily, weekly, and monthly delivery dates. Contracts with daily settlement dates are available from two days to three months in the future, which means that on 2020-05-12, contracts with daily delivery dates for 2020-05-14, 2020-05-18, 2020-05-19 ... 2020-08-10, 2020-08-11, and 2020-08-12 are available for trading. Contracts with weekly settlement dates are available from three months to six months in the future, which means that on 2020-05-12, contracts with weekly delivery dates for 2020-08-12, 2020-08-19, 2020-08-26 ... 2020-11-12, 2020-11-18, and 2020-11-25 are available for trading. Contracts with monthly settlement dates are available from six months to 123 months in the future, which means that on 2020-05-12, contracts with monthly delivery dates for 2020-05-20, 2020-06-17, 2020-07-15, ... 2020-06-19, 2020-07-17, and 2030-08-21 are available for trading. ==Secondary Uses== LME Aluminium futures contract prices serves as a platform for Aluminium price discovery because futures markets are more publicly visible and more accessible, due to lower transaction costs, for a larger number of buyers and sellers than the cash market. A larger number of buyers and sellers in the futures market allows those market participants to incorporate more demand and supply information into the futures price compared with the cash price. Cash markets are also more susceptible to the exercise of market power by large buyers and sellers, while such market power is less effective in futures markets where there are more participants and where price information is publicly available. For all of these reasons and more, LME Aluminium futures contract prices (and other Aluminium futures prices) become reference prices for Aluminium transaction prices in general. LME Aluminium futures prices are also a part of both the Bloomberg Commodity Index and the S&P; GSCI commodity index, which are benchmark indices widely followed in financial markets by traders and institutional investors. Its weighting in these commodity indices give LME Aluminium prices non-trivial influence on returns on a wide range of investment funds and portfolios. ==Related derivatives== LME also offers other derivatives related to primary Aluminium. Options, TAPOs, Monthly Average Futures, and LMEminis. Aluminium products like Aluminium alloys and Alumina also have their own LME contracts for trading. Aluminum contracts are also available for trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The CME Aluminium futures contract are for 25 metric tonnes of primary Aluminium and prices are quoted in US dollars per tonne. 60 consecutive monthly CME Aluminium contracts are available for trading. The Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) offers Aluminum futures contracts for trading as well, SHFE contracts are for 5 metric tonnes of primary Aluminum and prices are quoted in Yuan per tonne. ==Warehouse controversy== Physical Aluminium warehouse stocks associated with LME Aluminium futures contracts have been at the center of a number of controversies. In 2013, a number of Aluminium users filed three lawsuits against the LME, Metro International Trade Services (Metro) - a LME approved warehouse operator, Glencore Xstrata, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Glencore Plc, and other commodity companies for colluding from 2009 to 2012 to manipulate Aluminium and Aliuminium premium prices by hoarding Aluminium inventory. Separately, the United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations investigated the role of Goldman Sachs in the Aluminium market. These lawsuits and investigations centers on Goldman Sach's ownership of LME warehouses, and the buildup of Aluminium warrants in those warehouses to execute LME Aluminium futures contracts. == References == == External links == Category:Futures markets ","title":"LME Aluminium"},{"id":"63902624","text":"On the morning of 8 May 2020, an empty goods train ran over and killed sixteen migrant workers sleeping on or by the tracks near Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India. One additional worker sleeping nearby was injured. ==Background== The Indian government announced a nationwide lockdown on 24 March to control the COVID-19 pandemic in India. This caused job losses for migrant workers in multiple cities, many of whom have no formal contracts. The government stopped train services, making it difficult for these labourers to travel home. Consequently, many of them had to walk home. ==Accident== A group of 20 labourers were walking from steel factories in Jalna, Maharashtra, to Bhusawal so that they could board a \\"Shramik Special\\" train to reach their homes in Umariya and Shahdol districts of Madhya Pradesh. After walking along a minor road, they reached the railway tracks at Badnapur at about 0330 hours on 8 May 2020. Exhausted, they slept on and near the tracks, believing that no trains were running due to the lockdown. An empty goods train from Cherlapally in Hyderabad was heading towards Paniwada in Maharashtra. The locomotive driver realised that people were laying on the tracks only away from them. The train was moving at , and despite applying the emergency brakes, it was unable to stop before hitting the workers. The fourteen sleeping on the tracks were killed instantly, while three nearby were injured, two of whom later died in hospital. Just four from the group of twenty survived, three of whom were sleeping away from the tracks. ==Aftermath== Indian Railways ordered an inquiry to be headed by the Commissioner of Railway Safety. The Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh state governments announced as compensation for the relatives of the deceased victims. The bodies of the sixteen migrant labourers were moved to Jabalpur by two bogies attached to a special train. ==Reactions== Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed anguish and offered \\"all possible assistance\\". Former President of the Indian National Congress Rahul Gandhi asked why migrants were still walking home and stated that ‚Äúwe should be ashamed of treating the nation-builders like this‚Äù. CPI-M General Secretary Sitaram Yechury tweeted, ‚Äúthe death of these poor labourers is solely due to the sudden announcement of a lockdown and denial of transport to them for weeks, while not providing a substantive relief package‚Äù. He described the Central government's actions towards migrant workers as \\"criminal\\". CPI General Secretary D Raja said that \\"migrant workers are being treated in a most inhumane manner by the government\\". Terming the deaths a 'deliberate killing', he accused the government of having \\"practically left them to fend for themselves without any aid or help‚Äù. Former Finance Minister and Indian National Congress member P.

It lies southwestern coastal Spain, along the Mediterranean Sea. ==Geography== The ecoregion covers coastal low plains, hills, and badlands close to Spain's southeastern coast. The ecoregion's geology is complex, made up mostly of sedimentary rocks like marl, gypsum, limestone, conglomerate, sandstone and consolidated dunes, together with coastal outcrops of volcanic rock like Cabo de Gata. The region is geologically active, with faults, earthquakes, recently uplifted areas. The seashore includes both coastal dunes and lagoons and areas of rocky coast. The cities of Almer√≠a and Cartagena are in the ecoregion. ==Climate== The ecoregion has a Mediterranean climate, with rainfall mostly in the winter months, and a yearly summer drought. The ecoregion is hotter and drier than neighboring ecoregions, and known as 'thermo-Mediterranean'. Annual rainfall ranges from 200 to 250 mm. Winters are mild, averaging 11‚Äì12¬∫ C. Summers are hot and dry, and summer temperatures can exceed 46¬∫ C. Drying winds like the Saharan sirocco are frequent. ==Flora== Shrublands are the predominant vegetation. The shrublands vary in height and species composition based on underlying soils. The area is very species-rich; more than half of the c. 7500 vascular plants found in Iberia occur in the Murcian-Almerian bioprovince, which overlaps the ecoregion.J. S. Carri√≥n, S. Fern√°ndez, G. Jim√©nez-Moreno, S. Fauquette, G. Gil-Romera, P. Gonz√°lez-Samp√©riz, and C. Finlayson (2010). \\"The historical origins of aridity and vegetation degradation in southeastern Spain\\". Journal of Arid Environments 74 (2010) 731‚Äì736 \\"Open high-shrub communities\\" are the most common, composed of drought-adapted shrubs like Ziziphus lotus, Withania frutescens, Periploca angustifolia, Calicotome intermedia, Rosmarinus eriocalyx, Maytenus senegalensis subsp. europaea, Cistus libanotis, Ephedra fragilis, Genista ramosissima, Lycium intricatum, Rhamnus oleoides, Pistacia lentiscus, Olea europaea var. sylvestris, Chamaerops humilis, and Launaea arborescens. Trees are uncommon. Conifers, including pines, junipers, and Tetraclinis articulata, occasionally grow in the high shrublands. Seasonally-dry streambeds are home to the broadleaf trees Tamarix spp., white poplar (Populus alba), and oleander (Nerium oleander). Garrigue communities grow in drier and rockier areas, often close to the seacoast. Garrigue is characterized by aromatic and medicinal subshrubs, including species of thyme (Thymus), sage (Salvia), Sideritis, germander (Teucrium), and lavender (Lavandula), with succulent plants like Caralluma europaea and herbaceous species. Dry grasslands are characterized by the grasses Stipa tenacissima and Lygeum spartum, interspersed with subshrubs like Artemisia herba-alba. The fiber from S. tenacissima and L. spartum is known as esparto, and is harvested to make paper, cords, baskets, and espadrilles. Salt-rich soils are home to salt-tolerant (halophyte) plant communities, including species of Suaeda, Salsola, Limonium and Arthrocnemum, and Atriplex halimus, Anabasis articulata, and Haloxylon articulatum. ==Fauna== Resident birds include the little bustard (Tetrax tetrax), black-bellied sandgrouse (Pterocles orientalis), lesser short-toed lark (Alaudala rufescens), Thekla's lark (Galerida theklae), black wheatear (Oenanthe leucura), and Dupont's lark (Chersophilus duponti). The ecoregion's lagoons and salt marshes support water birds. A community of greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) lives in the Cabo de Gata wetlands. Punta Entinas-Sabinar is home to the Eurasian stone- curlew (Burhinus oedicnemus), Audouin's gull (Ichthyaetus audouinii), and slender-billed gull (Chroicocephalus genei). ==Human impacts== Human activities, including grazing sheep and goats, agriculture, hunting, mining, and urbanization, have been altering the region's ecology for centuries. In recent decades many rural people have migrated to cities, and lands formerly used for grazing and agriculture have reverted to native vegetation. Gathering esparto for paper and fiber was historically a means of livelihood, but its use and economic importance has declined in recent decades. Cities and tourism-related development have expanded along the coast. The coastal plains around Almer√≠a are used for intensive farming, particularly greenhouses. ==Protected areas== 952 km¬≤, or 35%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include Calblanque Regional Park, Cabo de Gata-Nijar Natural Park, Punta Entinas-Sabinar Nature Reserve, and Desierto de Tabernas Nature Reserve. ==External links== * ==References== Category:Ecoregions of Europe Category:Ecoregions of Spain Category:Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub Category:Palearctic ecoregions Category:Geography of Andalusia Category:Geography of the Region of Murcia ","title":"Southeastern Iberian shrubs and woodlands"},{"id":"63902669","text":"is a Japanese former Nippon Professional Baseball pitcher. == References == Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Baseball people from Kanagawa Prefecture Category:Japanese baseball players Category:Nippon Professional Baseball pitchers Category:Yokohama BayStars players Category:Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters players ","title":"Yukiya Yokoyama"},{"id":"63902677","text":"The National Agroforestry Policy of India is a comprehensive policy framework designed to improve agricultural livelihoods by maximizing agricultural productivity for mitigating climate change. The Government of India launched the policy in February 2014 during the World Congress on Agroforestry, held in Delhi. India became the first country in the world to adopt an agroforestry policy. The policy aims to improve productivity and environmental sustainability by integrating trees, crops, and livestock into the same plot of land. It was created to counteract limited agricultural productivity due to consistent decreases in the land-holding share of farmers, which was caused by rapid population growth and agricultural activity dependent on seasonal rainfall. ==Background== Throughout the world, most agroforestry systems have been practiced since the Neolithic period. Indians consider Ashok Vatika, a garden in Hindu epic Ramayana, which consisted of plants and fruit-bearing trees, as an example of an agroforestry system. Even today, there are many rituals associated with the trees and agricultural farms in India. Since the 1970s, in line with initiatives taken by other countries, the Indian government has also promoted research in the field of agroforestry. Even though agriculture was valued by social and religious practices; some experts noted that various government regulations were seen as an impediment in advancing agroforestry. Another aspect for the need of an agroforestry policy was the lack of the forest and tree cover in India. According to the Forest Survey of India in 2019, the country had 80.7 million hectares of forest and tree cover, which accounts to 24.56% of the total geographic area in the country; however, the country requires one third (33.3%) of its land under forest and tree cover, according to the National Forest Policy. ==Policy== Before 2014, as there was no dedicated government agency overlooking agroforestry in India, it could not amass enough encouragement from the government. Alhough agroforestry was practiced on a restricted scale, 60% of the country's timber requirement was fulfilled by the same. Experts traced the reasons for such limited results to mainly technical, regulatory, and financial hurdles faced by farmers, which raised the need for an agroforestry policy in India. ===Goals=== * Setting up a national nodal authority to bring in coordination among different schemes, programs, and policies pertaining to agroforestry spread across diverse agriculture development sectors of the government. * Raising the economic condition of small farmers by increasing productivity and exploiting agroforestry systems. * Preserving the environment and meeting the increasing requirements of timber and other agroforestry products. * Growing the forest and tree cover in the country. ===Strategy=== * Establishing a Mission or a Board under the Ministry of Agriculture to coordinate, plan, and implement between various inter-ministerial agencies, agroforestry related requirements, and policies like mobilization of financial resources, technical and management assistance to the farmers, and facilitation of capacity building initiatives. * Leveraging various ongoing schemes and programs of the Government of India to carry out and promote agroforestry systems like MGNREGA, NRLM, and RKVY. Various state governments may establish a nodal authority to implement agroforestry schemes at the district level by partnering with KVGs, NGOs, farmers‚Äô cooperative societies, and private sector and other concerned agencies. * Encouraging research in agroforestry and nominating ICAR and ICRAF to initiate the research and development (R&D;) of agroforestry. * Simplifying various laws and procedures related to harvest and transit of agroforestry products within the state. * Decentralizing the regulatory mechanisms and empower various institutions at the local level. * Creating and maintenance of a database and information systems relating to various aspects of agroforestry systems. * Providing easy access for farmers to quality seeds, fertilizers, and other agroforestry planting materials through certifying nurseries and leveraging private sector cooperation. Arranging easy access to markets for farmers. * Arranging institutional credit and insurance facilities to farmers practicing agroforestry systems. ==Reception== ===Challenges=== Any policy or government scheme needs wide acceptance among its beneficiaries to be successful. Among the many challenges to the national agroforestry policy are that farmers believe cultivating trees around farmland is counterproductive to their main source of income by reducing the crop yield by 40‚Äì60%. The government has a challenge in educating farmers towards plant-to-plant interactions and making suggestions to the farmers based on empirical evidence on productive plantations. ===Criticism=== Many experts believe the agroforestry policy is a damage control measure against the National Forest Act of 2006, which intends to provide forest land to tribals, allowing them to practice agriculture. However, Kishore Rithe, a former member of the National Board for Wildlife, observes that tribals will eventually cut down trees and practice agriculture. Both policies are contradictory to each other. Some commentators have questioned the profit-sharing method, which involves private owners in afforestation efforts. They believe the government, through this policy, is converting the agricultural land into a manufacturing enterprise, which could damage the ecological balance in the region. ==References== ==Further reading== * An Introduction to Agroforestry by P.K.R Nair ==External links== National Agroforestry Policy document Category:Agroforestry Category:Environmental policy Category:Policies of India Category:Agriculture in India ","title":"Indian agroforestry policy"},{"id":"63902686","text":"Slavery in the Bahamas dates back several centuries. ==19th century== ===Golden Grove uprising=== In December 1831, a slave riot occurred on the estate of Joseph Hunter, who had the largest slave holdings on Golden Grove. Although the Consolidated Slave Act of 1797 stated that all slaves were entitled to rest on Christmas and the next two working days, Christmas in 1831 was on a Sunday which had already been an official rest day for slaves since 1830. Therefore, it was up to their owners to determine when their one outstanding rest day would be repaid. However, Hunter's slaves were displeased with his designation of the Saturday before Christmas week as their rest day; they continued to work on Saturday, collecting their Christmas allowances on Sunday instead, and demanded that Wednesday be their holiday. At the direction of senior slave \\"Black Dick\\" Deveaux, the slaves defied Hunter's orders to harvest corn on Wednesday and some were even accused by Hunter of stealing fruit. On 30 December, Black Dick, his sons, Wally and Richard, and the other slaves surrounded the Hunter estate; Black Dick and his sons were armed with muskets, although slaves were not permitted by law to bear firearms. A shootout ensued with no fatalities and the rebellion lasted for three days, while Hunter made preparations to leave for Nassau in early January 1832. The perpetrators were subsequently arrested by the Second West India Regiment led and trialed on 25 January 1832; Black Dick and six other slaves were sentenced to death by hanging. ===The end of slavery=== Slavery was legally ended in all British colonies in 1833. On 7 November 1841, in what has been described as \\"the most successful revolt of enslaved people in U.S. history\\", a mutiny occurred on the New Orleans-bound Creole which was transporting some 135 slaves from Richmond, Virginia; after wounding the captain and killing one of the slave traders, the mutineers navigated the ship to the Bahamas, where all the slaves onboard ultimately found their freedom. ==Modern era== In 1992, the Pompey Museum of Slavery and Emancipation, named after \\"a courageous slave, Pompey, who lived on the Rolle Plantantion on Steventon, Exuma\\", was established at the former Vendue House marketplace at Bay Street, Nassau. In October 2013, following a Caribbean Community (CARICOM) meeting on reparations in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the Bahamas joined 13 other CARICOM states in formally demanding slavery compensation from Britain, Holland, and France. ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * Category:Slavery in the Caribbean Category:Slavery by country Category:History of the Bahamas ","title":"Slavery in the Bahamas"},{"id":"63902703","text":"The 1938 Idaho gubernatorial election was held on November 8, 1938.

Their priority is to get her married off at the earliest. But in case they fail to find and fix her marriage within a reasonable time to a suitable groom of their choice, they decide to offer the girl as Dakshina to a priest, which is called Daiva marriage. No qualities of groom like good character, conduct, etc. are emphasized in this form of marriage. Typically, this type of marriage literally amounts to giving away the bride to the priest, at times due to inability of her family to organise her, being poor. Among eight types of marriages defined in Hinduism, as specifically mentioned in Manu Smriti (Verse 3.21)), namely (1) Brahma (Hindi: ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ), (2) Daiva (Hindi: ‡§¶‡•à‡§µ), (3) Arsha (Hindi: ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂), (4) Prajapatya (Hindi: ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§æ‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø), (5) Asura (Hindi: ‡§Ö‡§∏‡•Å‡§∞), (6) Gandharva (Hindi: ‡§ó‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ), (7) Rakshasa (Hindi: ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§∏), and (8) Paishacha (Hindi: ‡§™‡•à‡§∂‡§æ‡§ö), this type of marriage that is considered inferior because it is degrading to womanhood.

He was also a successful landholder. Her father, the founder of the Van Cortlandt family in America, who emigrated from Holland in 1638, was the fourth wealthiest man in New Amsterdam in 1674 and was a city official under the Dutch and English regimes. As a teenager, she had responsibility for building the customer base and managing distribution for her father's brewery business. The oldest daughter, and third of seven children, her siblings included Stephanus Van Cortlandt, the founder of Van Cortlandt Manor, and Jacobus Van Cortlandt, both of whom served as Mayor of New York City. ==Marriage and children== Mark of the colony of Rensselaerswyck, by Kiliaen van Rensselaer, the first Patroon of Rensselaerswyck, 1630s On July 12, 1662, the nearly seventeen-year-old Maria married Jeremias van Rensselaer, who was the Patroon and Director of Rensselaerswyck. She was then known as Maria van Rensselaer or Maria van Cortland van Rensselaer. Jeremias was the first of the van Rensselaers to settle in America. Upon her marriage, Maria gave up the life of the city of New Amsterdam to live with her husband in what was then the wilderness, and would later become Albany. Jeremias died in October 1674. At that time, van Rensselaer was pregnant and had five children, including Kiliaen, Johannes, Anna, Hendrick, and Maria, who married Pieter Schuyler. Anna first married her cousin, Kiliaen Van Rensselaer fourth Patroon of the manor, who died in 1687. She married a second time to William Nicoll, with whom she had a child or children. After her husband's death, van Rensselaer sent Kiliaen to New Amsterdam from 1678 to 1682, and then to Boston, for apprenticeship and training as a silversmith. In Boston, now a journeyman, he studied under Jeremiah Dummer from 1682 to 1683, with expenses paid by his uncles. Under Dummer's tutelage, he was able to make large silver pieces. She kept the three youngest children‚ÄîMaria, Johannes, and Jeremias‚Äîwith her. Henrick and Anna went to live with her parents in New Amsterdam. On April 7, 1679, she acquired a house and lot on Jonkeer Street, now called Broad Street, in Albany. ==Business== Bearing in mind his wife's work experience, Jeremias established a brewery by mid-1665 on the east side of the Hudson River; their house was on the west side of the river. Van Rensselaer worked that business. When a flood washed away their house and brewery, they were rebuilt near each other just north of present-day Albany. In the summer of 1668, she wanted to engage in the fur trade, but due to the war between England and Holland and halted cross-Atlantic shipping, goods were not received in New Amsterdam to trade for furs. The van Rensselaers generated some income from their brewery, but not what they would have been possible during a healthy local economy. Years of wars between the Algonquins and the Mohawk tribes made it difficult to engage in commerce. ==Manor of Rensselaerswyck== Map of Manor of Rensselaerswyck, 1777 Upon the death of her husband, she became the administrator and treasurer of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck. The manor was owned by people in Holland, and Jeremias and then Maria, oversaw the property. Jeremias was paid for his role as Patroon, but Maria had to rely on whatever income she could generate from the farm. Rev. Nicholas van Rensselaer served as director until he died in 1678. Her brother Stephanus van Cortlandt was an advisor and bookkeeper. The manor was a million acres, approximately 24 by 24 miles ‚Äî or 24 by 48 miles. It had a gristmill and sawmill, which she oversaw as administrator of the manor. She also managed the finances, and negotiated agreements with Dutch family members who took income from the estate and with tenants. She had to manage attempts by van Rensselaer family members, like Nicholas, to take control of the manor, which she sought to hold for her children. Van Rensselaer became the acting director upon the death of Nicholas, with her brother, who lived in New Amsterdam, as the official director. Jasper Danckaerts, a Labadists missionary, visited the manor in 1680 and described van Rensselaer as \\"polite, quite well-informed, and of good life and disposition\\". She was a complicated woman who could be self-sacrificing and a woman of many positive traits and at other times could be \\"duplicitous and scheming, ambitious, avaricious, and mean-spirited\\". In 1687, her son Kiliaen became the fifth Patroon of the manor, upon the death of his cousin (and brother-in-law) Kiliaen. ==Personal life== In the fall of 1662, van Rensselaer contracted smallpox during an epidemic that Jeremias wrote to his mother \\"raged here so severely that it is indescribable.\\" Maria recovered, but had evidence of the having had the smallpox for some time. She was then pregnant with their first child, Kiliaen, who was born on August 24, 1663. After having given birth, she had pain in her right leg that emanated from her hip. It made it difficult for her to stand on her legs and walk, particularly during stormy and cold weather. She became lame due to a combination of osteomyelitis of the femur and septic arthritis. For the rest of the her life she used crutches to get around, sometimes within limited confines of the house. Van Rensselaer's twelve-year-old sister, Catherine (also Catrina), came to live with the van Rensselaers by January 1665. House at the Watervliet farm, built by Jeremias van Rensselaer following the April 7, 1666 flood. By April 7, 1666, chunks of ice had log-jammed on the Hudson River and caused an extensive flood, which cleared away 40 buildings and barns. Included in that total was the van Rensselaer's house, brewery, and a barn. They were only able to carry away a trunk of their best clothes and linens and then retrieve a few of their household items that had washed away. Until they could rebuild their house, the family lived in a room of a friend's house. During that time, around the first of November, van Rensselaer gave birth to the couple's third child, Hendrick. Jeremias had a new house on their farm called Watervliet built within a mile north of Albany. It was completed in the winter and new brewery was completed in the summer of 1667. In January 1669/1670, she had a still born baby. In December 1670, she had their fifth child, the fourth surviving baby, Johannes. She lived in Albany and was a member of the Albany Dutch church. Van Rensselaer died at age 43 on January 29, 1689 at Rensselaerswyck. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1645 births Category:1689 deaths Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:People of New Netherland Category:People from New York (state) Maria Category:17th-century businesswomen Category:17th-century Dutch businesspeople ","title":"Maria van Cortlandt van Rensselaer"},{"id":"63902794","text":"A c. 13th-century depiction of a minstrel The Court of Minstrels was a court held in Tutbury, Staffordshire, for minstrels (travelling musicians) from the nearby counties. The court was founded by John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster, who held Tutbury Castle, for the encouragement of the minstrels' art and for their better regulation. A King of the Minstrels governed the court and juries of minstrels adjudicated in disputes and complaints. The court met annually at Tutbury on the Assumption of Mary, 15 August, and the following day held entertainments including the Tutbury bull run. The court was ordered to cease in 1778 but seems to have continued into the early 19th century. == Foundation == A 13th-century depiction of minstrels in Castile In the 14th century music was an important form of entertainment and minstrels, travelling musicians, occupied a position of some status. John of Gaunt, who held Tutbury Castle, in 1372 claimed the title of King of Castile, in modern Spain, through his marriage to Constance of Castile. His royal court at Tutbury encouraged the art of the minstrels, including by bringing some over from Spain, and was a key centre for the musicians. In the fourth year of the reign of Richard II (c. 1381) John implemented a \\"King of the Minstrels\\" to help govern the musicians. There were complaints from the minstrels that the fines levied by the king were too severe and so, shortly afterwards, a Court of Minstrels was founded to levy the fines and handle complaints and disputes within the trade. == Proceedings == The jurisdiction of the court seems to have varied. At one time it encompassed the counties of Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire and Warwickshire but by the fifth year of the reign of Charles I (c. 1630) it was limited to Staffordshire and Derbyshire. All minstrels within the court's jurisdiction were compelled to attend or else pay a fine which, by 1630, was four shillings and six pence. In one story the legendary outlaw Robin Hood is said to have attended the court. The court seems to have acted mainly to encourage the quality of music performed by minstrels. By 1630 laws, enacted by the king, were enforced that all minstrels in the jurisdiction of the court were to be approved by the juries of that court. No man could trade as a minstrel without first undertaking seven years of training with an approved minstrel, or else be fined three shillings and four pence for each month of the offence. Any approved minstrel taking on an apprentice and failing to provide the required years of training would be fined 40 shillings. All fines levied were divided between the stewards of the court and the Duchy of Lancaster (as John of Gaunt had held this title). The court looks to have created a well-ordered society of minstrels with pride in their work and as such to have functioned in a similar manner to the tradesmen's guilds of the period. == Ceremony of the court == An 1821 depiction of a bull run elsewhere in England The court met on the day of the Assumption of Mary, 15 August, and all minstrels in the jurisdiction were compelled to attend on penalty of a fine of three shillings and four pence. The minstrels assembled at the house of the bailiff of the Manor of Tutbury and proceeded, in procession, to St Mary's Church (which was the church of Tutbury Priory). This procession was led by the bailiff and the steward of Tutbury together with the \\"King of the Minstrels\\", who was elected annually, attended by four of his own stewards. After a church service the minstrels proceeded to Tutbury Castle to hold court. Two juries, each of fifteen men, were assembled, one of minstrels from Staffordshire and one of representatives of the other counties. The court then undertook its business of adjudicating disputes and levying fines. Afterwards the juries met to select a new king for the following year from among the stewards and also to elect four new stewards, two for Staffordshire and two for the other counties. Afterwards the new king was formally invested with his wand of office by the outgoing king, during a banquet. After another meal, dinner, the minstrels processed to the priory gate to witness the Tutbury bull run, a blood sport entertainment in which a bull, provided by the priory, was let loose through the streets. The bull would be chased by the minstrels who could claim it for their own, if caught. The bull was thereafter eaten by those assembled. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the Duke of Devonshire, who had acquired the priory estates, provided the bull and the event commenced from the barn of the town's bailiff. == Decline == In 1772 the court wrote to William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire to complain about the deterioration of the court and to lay claim to rents and other obligations that it said were due. The court claimed it was in danger of collapse due to the financial situation and the absence of minstrels from the juries. The court was ordered abolished by the Duke of Devonshire in 1778 due to the destruction and inconvenience caused by the annual bull run. The court defied this order but seems to have fallen into disuse at some point between 1817 and 1832. == References == == Further reading == * Category:Medieval performers Category:History of Staffordshire Category:History of Derbyshire ","title":"Court of Minstrels"},{"id":"63902803","text":"Logo Tehnopol (also Tallinn Technology Park) is science and business park in Tallinn, Estonia.

It was written by Maxime Crochemore and Wojciech Rytter, and published by World Scientific in 2003. ==Topics== The first topics of the book are two basic string-searching algorithms for finding exactly-matching substrings, the Knuth‚ÄìMorris‚ÄìPratt algorithm and the Boyer‚ÄìMoore string-search algorithm. It then describes the suffix tree, an index for quickly looking up matching substrings, and two algorithms for constructing it. Other topics in the book include the construction of deterministic finite automata for pattern recognition, the discovery of repeated patterns in strings, constant-space string matching algorithms, and the lossless compression of strings. Approximate string matching is covered in several variations including edit distance and the longest common subsequence problem. The book concludes with advanced topics including two-dimensional pattern matching, parallel algorithms for pattern matching, the shortest common superstring problem, parameterized pattern matching and duplicate code detection, and the Rabin‚ÄìKarp algorithm. ==Audience and reception== The book is written for an audience familiar with algorithm design and analysis, but not necessarily familiar with string algorithms. Reviewer Rolf Klein suggests that this target audience may be narrow, as he evaluates the book as being too difficult for many students, but not supplying as much depth for experts as the same authors' earlier book Text Algorithms (1994). Reviewer Shoshana Marcus writes that the algorithms chosen for inclusion in the book are \\"elegant yet fundamental\\" but have often been overlooked by more general algorithms textbooks. She writes that the book itself should become a valuable reference for researchers in this area, and that it could also be used to supplement undergraduate or graduate course material in algorithms. Reviewer Ricardo Baeza-Yates suggests that the book's omission of bit-level parallel programming techniques reflects its bias towards theoretical rather than practical methods, but nevertheless agrees with its suitability for graduate courses. ==References== Category:Algorithms on strings Category:Computer science books Category:2003 non-fiction books ","title":"Jewels of Stringology"},{"id":"63902895","text":"Wes Kremer (born November 27, 1989) is an American professional skateboarder.

The structure was damaged at the time of the Venetian sack of Pola in 1243, and building material was subsequently taken from the ruins and primarily incorporated into the Marciana Library and the Basilica of Saint Mark in Venice. Of the large, triple-nave church, comparable in splendour to the Euphrasian Basilica in Parenzo (modern-day Poreƒç),Caprin, L'Istria nobilissima, p. 50 only one of the lateral chapels survives. It constitutes the sole construction in Pola dating to the Byzantine period.Morassi, La chiesa di Santa Maria Formosa..., p. 21 ==History of the basilica== Maximianus of Ravenna, Basilica of San Vitale, Ravenna ===Edification=== Installed as bishop of Ravenna in 546, Maximianus, a native of Vistar (Ve≈°tar) near Pola in Istria, continued the building programme of his predecessors Ecclesius and Ursicinus, completing the Basilicas of San Vitale and Sant'Apollinare in Classe. In Pola, where he had served as a young deacon, he had a new basilica erected on the site of a former temple of Minerva.Luciani, 'Pola', pp. 20 and 22Mackie, Early Christian Chapels..., p. 47 Andreas Agnellus, the historian of the Ravennate bishops, indicates in Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis that the church in Pola was the first to be erected by Maximianus.Morassi, La chiesa di Santa Maria Formosa‚Ä¶, p. 12 It was formally dedicated to the Virgin Mary under the title of Santa Maria Formosa. But since it was built in a low-lying area of the city near the marshes along the waterfront, it has been customarily known since the twelfth century as Santa Maria del Canneto (Saint Mary of the reeds).Mackie, Early Christian Chapels..., p. 48 From at least the eighth century, a Benedictine abbey was attached.The abbey may have been founded by Maximianus at the time of the construction of the basilica. But the earliest recorded abbot, Theodosius, was installed in 717. See Morassi, La chiesa di Santa Maria del Canneto..., pp. 12 and 22, note 6, and Kandler, 'Della Basilica di S. Maria Formosa in Pola', p. 172 The abbey had jurisdiction over the Monastery of Saint Andrew di Serra, located on an island in the harbour of Pola.Kandler, 'Della Basilica di S. Maria Formosa in Pola', p. 172 (see footnote) The church, long and wide, had three naves, divided by two rows of ten columns each that were surmounted by 'basket' capitals. The columns sat on low-lying walls that separated the three naves, as originally in the Euphrasian Basilica.Kandler, 'Della Basilica di S. Maria Formosa in Pola', pp. 173‚Äì174Morassi, La chiesa di Santa Maria Formosa‚Ä¶, p. 14 Like other churches built in Africa and Italy following the Byzantine reconquest under Justinian, the floor of Santa Maria del Canneto was covered with mosaics.Tavano, 'Mosaici parietali in Istria', p. 248 On the basis of surviving fragments, these mosaics, predominantly green and red, depicted intertwined lilies and lotus flowers together with curvilinear patterns.Morassi, La chiesa di Santa Maria Formosa..., pp. 14‚Äì15 The central nave terminated in an apse with choir stalls for the monks and the cathedra of the abbot. In the centre rose the ciborium. The lateral naves ended in the prothesis, for the liturgical preparation of the bread and wine, and the diaconicon, for the dressing of the clergy. Attached to the structure, but independent, were two chapel-mausoleums, dedicated to Saint Andrew and to the Virgin Mary. ===Destruction=== In the early ninth century, the Venetians began to exact tribute from the Istrian cities in the form of olive oil, wine, and boats. From Pola, in particular, there was a tribute of hemp and an armed galley to assist in patrolling the upper Adriatic. This tribute was confirmed in a series of treaties (802‚Äì813) and militarily enforced by Venice whenever the Istrian cities attempted to rebel or other cities, commercial rivals of Venice, sought to gain influence.Luciani, 'Pola', pp. 29 and 31 Rebellions in Pola were put down in 1145, 1150, and 1160, and in 1193 Venice intervened to drive the rival Pisans from the city. Pola was taken by the Venetians in 1228 and again in 1243. Finally, in 1331, the city gave itself to Venice.Luciani, 'Pola', pp. 31‚Äì32 But as a Venetian subject city, it was repeatedly raided by the Genoese and briefly occupied as part of the wars between Venice and Genoa.Luciani, 'Pola', p. 32 The progressive destruction of the Basilica of Santa Maria del Canneto seems to have begun when Pola was plundered at the time of the Venetian conquest of 1243 under the leadership of Giacomo Tiepolo and Leonardo Quirini.Kandler, 'Della Basilica di S. Maria Formosa in Pola', p. 173Morassi, La chiesa di Santa Maria Formosa..., pp. 12‚Äì13 The last abbot is recorded in 1258, after which the abbey passed in commendam to the Church of Saint Mark in Venice. A priest was henceforth nominated from Venice.Caprin, L'Istria nobilissima, p. 51 note 1 The maintenance of the church fell to the procurators of Saint Mark de supra, the Venetian magistrates responsible for the Church of Saint Mark and for the public buildings around Saint Mark's Square. ===Despoliation=== The basilica was stripped over time of its precious marbles and columns for use as building materials elsewhere. Some art historians maintain that these materials included the four carved alabaster columns that form the ciborium over the high altar in Saint Mark's Basilica.Caprin, L'Istria nobilissima, p. 23Morassi, La chiesa di Santa Maria Formosa..., p. 13 The tradition narrates that they were taken from Santa Maria del Canneto during the reign of Doge Jacopo Tiepolo (1229‚Äì1249).Art historians do not unanimously agree on the origin or age of the columns. It has been alternatively suggested that they are Byzantine but come from lower Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor, Constantinople, or Ravenna and that they may even be thirteenth-century Venetian productions. See in general Weigel, Thomas, 'Le colonne del ciborio dell'altare maggiore di san Marco a Venezia: Nuovi argomenti a favore di una datazione in epoca protobizantina', Centro Tedesco di studi veneziani quaderni, 54 (2000), pp. 18‚Äì25. Concerns for the precarious conditions of the basilica were expressed in 1545 when Nicol√≤ Bernardo, procurator of Saint Mark de supra, instructed the Venetian representative in Pola to nominate surveyors who were to evaluate the nature and the cost of the work that would be needed to consolidate the structure and prevent it from falling into total ruin.Gallo, Jacopo Sansovino a Pola, p. 12 No record survives of the report, but workmen and supplies were sent from Venice in 1549. That same year, however, the procurators of Saint Mark de supra sent Jacopo Sansovino, their proto (consultant architect and buildings manager), with the precise task of selecting building other materials that could be removed and utilized to further embellish the Church of Saint Mark and to adorn the staircase of the Marciana Library in Venice.Gallo, Jacopo Sansovino a Pola, pp. 13‚Äì14Giuseppe Carpin alternatively suggests that the columns utlized in the Marciana Library come from the arena in Pola. See Caprin, L'Istria nobilissima, p. 28 Of particular interest were the marble columns in the nave which were to be substituted with brick supports. The Venetian architect Tommaso Temanza attests in Vite dei pi√π celebri architetti e scrittori veneziani (1778) that Sansovino took columns and marbles from Santa Maria del Canneto in 1550 and 1551 for Saint Mark's Basilica and the Doge's Palace.Temanza, Vite dei pi√π celebri architetti..., vol. I, p. 244 The despoliation is also confirmed in a petition by the citizenry of Pola to the procurators of Saint Mark, dated 1550, in which they request exoneration from the obligation to pay a tribute of one-tenth of the olive oil production, citing the removal of columns, marbles, porphyry, and serpentinite.Gallo, Jacopo Sansovino a Pola, p. 16 The amount of salvaged building materials must have been considerable, given that three ships had to be hired to transport the 22 columns removed, along with the marbles.Gallo, Jacopo Sansovino a Pola, p. 14 ==Surviving chapel== As late as the mid-nineteenth century, the apse, the prothesis and the diaconicon, the bases of the columns, and a portion of the perimeter wall of the original basilica were still reasonably intact as was one of the adjoining lateral chapels.Morassi, La chiesa di Santa Maria Formosa..., p. 11 But little remains today with the exception of a reduced section of the perimeter wall, parts of the prothesis and the diaconicon, and the chapel. Given its form and relationship to the principal basilica, as well as the similarities with the fifth-century Mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna, it is believed that this chapel was probably built as a tomb: a seventeenth-century description records the presence of the sarcophagus of a bishop.Morassi, La chiesa di Santa Maria Formosa..., p. 20 The chapel, constructed in rough stone with brick vaults, is in the form of a Latin cross with an apse that is polygonal on the exterior and semi-circular within. Its principal fa√ßade has been modified over time, only the arch above the central window being original to the early structure. But the remaining exterior walls are preserved. These are ornamented with blind arches and pilasters on the corners, unlike the exterior walls of most of the contemporary churches in Ravenna which are plain.Mackie, Early Christian Chapels in the West..., pp. 47‚Äì48Morassi, La chiesa di Santa Maria Formosa..., p. 16 The interior of the chapel is lit by wide-arched windows in the central tower and small windows in the transepts and the nave. Three of these windows have their original pierced stone screens. Mosaic fragment from the side chapel of Santa Maria del Canneto (Arheolo≈°ki Muzej Istre) Inside the chapel, the conch of the apse was originally covered with a golden mosaic which, as with many early depictions, showed Jesus as a beardless youth. The scene may have depicted the traditio legis. The subject, common in Paleochristian art, concerns the transmission of the gospel message and typically shows Christ, holding a scroll, with Saint Peter and Saint Paul on either side. At Santa Maria del Canneto, the heads of Christ and one of the two saints survive in a fragment now located in the nearby achaeological museum.Morassi, La chiesa di Santa Maria Formosa..., p. 16 Alternatively, the scene may have been a traditio clavium, showing Christ giving the keys to Saint Peter. This would be more appropriate for a funerary chapel and would not be incompatible with the compresence of Saint Paul receiving the law.Sergio Tavano suggests that the scene may have more likely portrayed Christ acclaiming two apostles. See Tavano, 'Mosaici parietali in Istria', p. 249 Below the conch was a border in stucco with a repeat design of paired birds holding garlands of flowers and fruit. Of this, fragments survive. The freize below the border contained the apostles and John the Baptist within illusionistic niches.Mackie, Early Christian Chapels in the West, p. 49 While the mosaics in the older churches in Ravenna, which date to the Ostrogothic Kingdom, show a strong Western influence, the mosaics in Santa Maria del Canneto are stylistically closer to contemporary mosaics in Constantinople and demonstrate the greater ties to the East and the resulting artistic influence that characterized the period of Byzantine rule.Tavano, 'Mosaici parietali in Istria', pp. 251‚Äì252 Significantly, the inscriptions in the mural mosaics of the main basilica were in Greek, unlike the churches in Ravenna where the inscriptions were in Latin. This is consistent with the tradition that the mosaicists who worked at Santa Maria del Canneto actually came from Constantinople. ==Notes and references== ==Bibliography== * Bovini, Giuseppe, Le antichit√† cristiane della fascia costiera istriana da Parenzo a Pola, 2 vols (Bologna: Patron, 1974) * Caprin, Giuseppe, L'Istria nobilissima (Trieste: F.

He also painted landscapes, portraits and still-lifes. ==Biography== At an early age, he began studying with the panorama painter, John Rowson Smith and the portrait painter, Thomas Sully. At the age of fourteen, he exhibited his first portrait and, the following year, exhibited with the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. He later worked in Virginia as well, although most of those works were lost during the Civil War. In 1849, he went to Europe and, after a brief stay in Paris, moved to Italy and settled in Florence. There, he met and befriended the sculptor, Hiram Powers and appears to have become a sort of uncle to his numerous children. In 1850, Powers entrusted him with the task of salvaging a statue of his that had been lost in a shipwreck: a task in which Gould was successful. In 1851, Powers encouraged him to travel to Turkey for a possible portrait commission and provided him with the means. The commission involved Lajos Kossuth, who had fled there as a refugee and was living in K√ºtahya. With a letter of introduction provided by the British Ambassador, Sir Stratford Canning, he was able to meet Kossuth and paint his portrait. Judging from his letters to Powers, they also became close friends. While there, he visited Istanbul and created some of the Orientalist works for which he is best remembered, as well as portraits, including one of the Grand Vizier, Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha. A brief visit to America was disappointing in terms of sales, and he returned to Florence. He would continue to paint some Orientalist genre scenes, in addition to many portraits; holding a major exhibit in 1866 at the National Academy of Design which was not, however, well-received by the critics. In his later years, a visit from his old friend, Moncure Conway, found him with dimming eyesight from painting too many portrait miniatures, and fond of talking about the past. He died of paralysis, while recovering from a stroke. A year after his death, his relatives made a gift of some of his works to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, but the great majority are in private collections. In many cases, their present locations are unknown. ==Sources== * Biographical notes @ Schwarz Gallery * Biographical notes and commentary @ Sotheby's * Biography in American Orientalists by Gerald M.

In 1812, he wrote the detailed booklet About the life, character and last religious afflictions of the infamous poisoner Hester Rebecca Nepping, sentenced to death with her accomplices, for the murder of her boarder, and of her husband == Biography == Nepping was born in Amsterdam in 1774, the only child of master painter Johannes Nepping and Cornelia Schram. At the age of 19, she married tobacco retailer Jan Brummelkamp in Amsterdam. Due to debts, they left the capital in 1800 for Loenen (present-day Hilversum), where Brummelkamp again opened a tobacco shop. After that business also failed, they moved to the village of Hall in 1805, where they both worked at a paper mill. == Inheritance == In 1808, Nepping acquired a considerable inheritance, including a house in Wijk bij Duurstede and five thousand guilders in cash. The couple moved there, with Jan buying a paper dyeing shop, which again, also failed. In the meantime, Hester had an extra-marital affair with the city messenger, Gerrit Verkerk. The inheritance ran out, and the couple had to take boarders: the elderly Beerenburg-Vinjole couple and their sister-in-law. The couple paid three thousand guilders for the services, with an additional amount to be paid in case they died. == Murders == Mrs. Beerenburg turned out to be a woman with a nasty attitude, and so Nepping, together with her maid Adriana van Rijswijk, planned to murder the woman. Beerenburg died on August 31, 1811. On November 9th, Hester's elderly father, who lived with her, died as well, followed two days later by her husband Jan. The deaths aroused suspicion, and the bodies were exhumed. The autopsy reports indicated that they had been poisoned with arsenic. Nepping and Van Rijswijk were arrested, as was Verkerk, who had provided the arsenic. In January 1812, they were detained in Amsterdam, where the trial was to take place. All three of them made partial confessions, and the Assizes considered two of the killings proven, handing down death sentences to all three of the accused. From 1810 onwards, because of the annexation of the Netherlands to the First French Empire, French criminal law was applied and an appeal had to be made to the court of cassation in Paris. The court upheld the verdict, and on June 15, 1812, all three were publicly guillotined in front of the Nieuwmarkt in Amsterdam. It was the only time that a death sentence was applied that way in the city's history. ==External links== * Nepping, Hester Rebecca (2015), in: Digital Women's Lexicon of the Netherlands.

It is a Grade II listed building. ==History== The building was commissioned to replace the aging public offices on the same site which had been designed by Thomas Goodchild in the Italianate style and completed in 1878. After the area became a urban district in 1894 and then a municipal borough in 1905, civic leaders decided that the old public offices were inadequate for their needs and should be demolished to make way for a new building. The new building, which was designed by Bradshaw Gass & Hope in the Classical style, was officially opened by Prince George on 5 November 1931.\\"Souvenir of the Opening of the New Town Hall Wimbledon by HRH The Prince George KG, GCVO\\" Edward Foster VC, who had been born in Streatham, was present for the ceremony. The design involved a symmetrical frontage with eleven bays at the junction of Queen's Road and the Broadway; the outer bays projected forward slightly and incorporated huge Doric order pilasters, while the central section of three bays featured a portico flanked by Doric order columns and pilasters on the ground floor with the borough coat of arms above; there were square-headed windows in all the bays on the first floor with a mansard roof above. The complex originally included an assembly hall at the rear and a \\"Kinema\\" for showing silent films; the complex was equipped with a pipe organ made by John Compton allowing it to host a regular programme of concerts by the Wimbledon Symphony Orchestra. During the Second World War, a civil defence control centre was installed in the basement and observation posts were placed on the roof. The building served as the headquarters of the Municipal Borough of Wimbledon for much of the 20th century and continued to serve as the local seat of government of the enlarged London Borough of Merton after it was formed in 1965. However, it became surplus to requirements after the council moved to Crown House in Morden in 1985. Following three planning inquiries, the assembly hall at the rear was demolished in the late 1980s, to make way for the Centre Court Shopping Centre. This left only the front range in place, which itself was converted for retail use to the designs of the Building Design Partnership in 1990. The groceries retailer, Tesco, moved into the ground floor of former front range of the town hall while the clothing business, H&M;, took the first floor a few years later. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Merton Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1931 Category:Grade II listed government buildings ","title":"Wimbledon Town Hall"},{"id":"63903324","text":"The sea trumpeter (Pelsartia humeralis) is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a grunter from the family Terapontidae.

It has a relatively small, oblique mouth with the upper jaw just reaching, or falling short of, the front of the eye. It has very small, conical teeth arranged in a single band on each jaw, with the outer teeth larger than the inner teeth. The dorsal fin contains 12-13 spines 11 soft rays with a notch two thirds of the way along it and the soft rayed part is rounded. The anal fin is similar in size and shape to the soft part of the dorsal fin and contains 3 spines and 10 soft rays. The caudal fin is slightly notched. There are 80-90 scales in the lateral line. The colour pattern is light greyish to brown dorsally, silvery to white ventrally with 4‚Äì5 broad dark vertical bands on the flanks which are more obvious immediately above the centre of the flanks. There are dark stripes on the head which run through and below the eyes. There are small darks spots on the soft part of the dorsal fin, the anal fin and the caudal fin. The juveniles also have 3 horizontal lines of dark spots on their back. They can attain a maximum total length of . ==Distribution== The sea trumpeter is endemic to the coastal waters of south western Australia from Kangaroo Island in South Australia to the Houtman Abrolhos in Western Australia, although it is uncommon in South Australia. ==Habitat and biology== The sea trumpeter is commonly found in seagrass beds in shallow water.

It is used for a variety of applications in road, rail, and marine transport. The defining characteristic of electric transmission is that it avoids the need for a gearbox, by converting the mechanical force of the engine into electrical energy (through a dynamo), and using the electrical energy to drive traction motors, which propel the vehicle mechanically. The traction motors may be driven directly, or in some cases, via a rechargeable battery; if rechargeable batteries are used, the vehicle is considered to be a hybrid vehicle. Electric transmission is usually classified as multiple separate transmission methods, according to engine type; for example, a vehicle powered by a petrol engine, using electrical transmission, would usually be classified as having petrol-electric transmission, despite the fact that the petrol engine is part of the engine, the transmission being a separate system. Electric transmission was first used in the early 1920s. It was generally found to be unfavourable compared to the other methods available at the time, traditional steam locomotive transmission being up to 15% more efficient. However, by the late 1920s it was recognised as the best for larger vehicles. == Advantages and disadvantages == The primary advantage of electric transmission is that it does not require gear changes, which allows for smoother acceleration. It can also offer substantial advantages, as it reduces energy wastage which occurs in mechanical transmission, if the operator of the vehicle neglects to change the vehicle's gear. This is especially true in heavier vehicles, where the force required to start moving is very high compared to that needed to maintain speed if already in motion; hence this system is most used by ships and railway locomotives; most cars instead use mechanical transmission, as they have lighter loads, and are more lightweight. However, these cost savings are somewhat offset by the increased weight, and higher initial cost of the generator, wiring, and motor. == Applications == * Petrol-electric transmission, for use with petrol engines. Substantially used in many industries in the early 20th century, but died out around the period of the Second World War due to the greater popularity of diesel engines. Use today in combination with energy stored in a battery pack as a hybrid electric vehicle * Diesel-electric transmission, for use with diesel engines. Mostly superseded petrol-electric transmission, taking much of the same markets. Much-used in diesel-electric locomotives and diesel-electric multiple units, on railways. Used in some road vehicles such as buses and trucks in combination with a battery pack to store the energy needed to drive the electric motor used as a hybrid electric vehicle * Turbo-electric transmission, for use with steam turbine engines. Substantially used by ships, especially military warships. * Turbine-electric transmission, for use with gas turbine engines. Has mostly superseded turbo-electric transmission. Much used in ships, and occasionally gas turbine-electric locomotives, on railways. == See also == * Mechanical transmission * Hydraulic transmissions and drive systems ** Hydrostatic transmission ** Hydrokinetic transmission ** Transmission using hydraulic rams/cyclinders == References == Category:Automotive transmission technologies ","title":"Electric transmission (propulsion)"},{"id":"63903429","text":"Darra was a barque-rigged clipper, built at Aberdeen and launched in 1865. Darra, circa 1875, flying the flag of the Orient Line. == Construction == Darra's hull was of a composite construction, wooden planking on a wrought iron frame. It was built by Hall and Company, Aberdeen. Its displacement was 999 tons, length 190 feet, beam 33 feet, and draft 21 feet. == Voyages and notable incidents == === Early voyages === Darra was built for the Orient Line. Its maiden voyage was between Aberdeen and India in 1866. Darra seems to have made only one voyage to India. As early as October 1866, one year after being launched, Darra was reported in London loading passengers for Australia. This was the first of many voyages between London and Adelaide, with passengers being taken to Australia, and goods from the colony being carried on the return voyage to London. In 1887, Darra broke the record for a passage between London and Adelaide, completing the voyage in 70 days. === 'The Darra Outrage' === On 26 November 1887, Darra, returning to London carrying a cargo of coal from Newcastle, Australia, put in to port in San Diego. The captain hired three seamen from the dock informally, to help trim ballast before sailing. That night, approximately 20 men from the Coast Seamen's Union boarded the vessel and forcibly removed the hired seamen, objecting to their having been hired. The boarders found the hired men, and carried them back to shore in their boats despite the captain having confronted the boarders with a revolver. The San Diego Union newspaper reported on the incident on 28 November, under the headline 'It Smacks of Piracy'. === New Zealand === In 1899, Darra was extensively damaged by fire while in Sydney Harbour. The remains of the vessel were purchased by the Westport Coal Company for use in New Zealand. Darra was towed to Dunedin where it was refitted, before being towed to Lyttelton. The dismasted hull was used as a coal hulk for the next fifty years, serving steam vessels in the Port of Lyttelton. == Beaching == In December 1950, Darra was temporarily rigged and painted to resemble the Charlotte Jane, as part of the Christchurch centenary celebrations. As soon as the celebrations were over, the rigging and fittings were dismantled, the hull was cut down and the vessel sold as scrap. The wreck of Darra on Quail Island, lying prominently side-on. In 1951, Darra was beached in the ships graveyard on Quail Island, beside the Mullogh and other wrecks, including the wrecks of two other former coal hulks. In April 1953, the army attempted to destroy the remains of Darra with explosives, but the explosion only blew a hole in the side of the hull.

They settled in the Rhinish town of Gr√§frath at Solingen, then in the Kingdom of Prussia. Her father acquired a long- established steel goods factory, and traded in cutlery. She attended the Lyceum in Solingen, later August-Dicke-Schule, together with her sister, and graduated with a Mittlere Reife. There was widespread hostility towards Russia and the Russians in Prussia at that time. As a precaution, in order to be spared reprisals, her father, whose place of birth was registered in his passport as Constantinople, went to Istanbul in 1913. He obtained Turkish citizenship for himself again and for his family members. His residence address was given as \\"Bereketzade Medrese No. 20, Pera Quarter, Constantinople\\", a location near the Galata Tower in today's Beyoƒülu district. After finishing school, Gusyk worked in her father's factory shop in Solingen as an intern. She then completed a commercial apprenticeship at the Barmer Bank-Verein in Solingen. By October 1918, her mother had died, and the next day her 16-year-old brother Paul succumbed to the Spanish flu. ==University years== In the summer of 1917, Gusyk went to Cologne and began her first higher education at the Handels-Hochschule C√∂ln (Trade College of Cologne). On 11 April 1919, Gusyk enrolled as the first woman, first foreigner, and first student from Solingen at the Faculty of Management, Economics and Social Sciences of the newly re-established University of Cologne under the matriculation number 2. The university was the successor of the Trade College of Cologne. Gusyk's student life did not pass relatively carefree. Her father left Solingen to move to Hamburg, and then to Berlin, imposing new duties on her. She took over and managed the cutlery business in Gr√§frath, and became the representative head of the family consisting of her sister and brother. Her siblings also moved to Cologne to live with her. Gusyk studied business administration, economic history, and law. After seven semesters, she passed the commercial diploma examination, and graduated in 1921 with distinction. During her education, she was also politically active. She was the only woman among the 51 graduates in the winter semester 1920/21. During her university days, her male fellow students called her the \\"Genia\\", especially for her admiration for the feminist ideas of the Russian writer Alexandra Kollontai. Her thesis on the French socialist and pacifist Jean Jaur√®s indicates her personal confession as a leftist. Gusyk's academic career ended when her already completed doctoral thesis was not accepted by her conservative doctoral supervisor, , because it was \\"too much penetrated with communist ideas\\". ==Berlin years== In 1923, Gusyk followed her father to Berlin and settled in Charlottenburg. There, she worked as a manager and accountant at a company. She married Karl Stucke, seven years her senior, the son of a master tailor from Bremen. On 27 November 1927, she gave birth to her only child, (Hans) Thomas. Karl and his younger brother Fritz regularly worked for left- wing radical newspapers, especially for Die Rote Fahne, the central organ of the Communist Party of Germany. With Adolf Hitler's rise to power, anti- communism and antisemitism emerged in Germany. In 1933, Gusyk's husband was taken into protective custody and was incarcerated in a concentration camp. When he was released a long time afterwards, he had no chance to pursue his journalistic profession. He took on jobs such as tailoring in a struggle to make a living. He was arrested again in 1939, and was ultimately sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. As told by family members, Gusyk could visit her husband there only once. Stucke died in the concentration camp on 14 January 1940, and was buried near the \\"Socialists' Memorial\\" at the Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde in Berlin, where notable leaders of the socialist and communist movement are interred. After the death of her husband, Gusyk lost all privileges of the so-called \\"mixed marriage\\" that she had obtained through her marriage to an Aryan of Protestant lineage. Upon her marriage, she had lost her Turkish citizenship, and had received her husband's German citizenship. She went into hiding to avoid persecution as a Jew. In 1942, her sister Rebekka fled to the United States via France and Portugal. Although Gusyk had an exit visa for her son and herself since the spring of 1940, she remained in Berlin, probably to care for her aging father. In January 1943, her father died in the nursing home of the Jewish community in Berlin. Gusyk, now blocked by Nazi law, was no longer able to leave Germany. ==Arrest and death== In June 1943, Gusyk was arrested after being denounced, and was jailed in the Gestapo prison on Prinz-Albrecht-Stra√üe. She was transferred to the Mecklenburg Prison, then back to Berlin's Lehrter Stra√üe Prison in Moabit. From there, she was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp like her brother Max and sister-in-law Lydia Gusyk. She died on 2 January 1944, at the age of 46. Gusyk's son Thomas Stucke survived World War II in Berlin, thanks to the support of his father's political comrades. ==Legacy== Commemorative stone at the residence of Jenny Stucke in Wuppertaler Str. 36, Solingen In 2009, the University of Cologne announced a gender equality award, the Jenny Gusyk Prize, with the consent of her son Thomas in the United States.

It was named after Marie Vogts. In the Afrikaans language it has been given the vernacular name of Marie-se-roossuikerbos. ==Taxonomy== Protea vogtsiae was first collected flowering in August of 1972 at 1,067 metres elevation on the lower southern slopes of the Saptoukop mountain in the Kouga range near the town of Willowmore by the South African botanist John Patrick Rourke. Rourke subsequently described it as a species new to science in an article in the Journal of South African Botany published in 1974. An isotype of Rourke's original collection (#1396) is housed in the herbarium at the Kew Botanical Gardens. ===Classification=== P. vogtsiae was classified in section Crinitae by Tony Rebelo in 1995, what he calls the \\"eastern ground sugarbushes\\", along with P. foliosa, P. intonsa and P. montana. ==Description== This species grows in the form of a low, dwarf shrublet only in height. It has subterranean stems (rhizomes), these have a characteristically scaled bark. The stems form loose tufts of leaves across. It has glaucous blue leaves forming a rosette, which blooms at ground level. The leaves are in length and 8‚Äì30 mm in width. The inflorescences are specialised structures called pseudanthia, also known simply as flower heads, containing hundred of reduced flowers, called florets. The involucral bracts are coloured dull carmine, flushed with green. It is monoecious, with both sexes occurring in each floret. ===Similar species=== Protea vogtsiae is similar to P. intonsa in section Crinitae, both being dwarf shrubs with subterranean stems, but has broader leaves more similar to those of P. foliosa, which is a much larger shrub with numerous erect-growing branches and with much broader, rounder and shorter leaves. ==Distribution== It is endemic to South Africa, where it is found in the mountain ranges straddling the southern border of Western and Eastern Cape provinces: the Outeniqua and Kouga mountains as well as the Baviaanskloof. It occurs on the Saptoukop and Hoopsberg in the Kouga Mountains. Different populations are small and isolated from each other, but nonetheless where it locally occurs it is common. ==Ecology== The plant grows exclusively in a fynbos habitat in the wild, where it is found on steep, rocky, south-facing slopes. It grows in substrates derived from sandstone. It is found at altitudes of 1,000 to 1,500 metres. It grows wedged between Table Mountain Sandstone boulders. The mature plants are killed by the wildfires which periodically pass through its habitat, but the seeds can survive such an event. It blooms in spring, from August to November. The flowers are pollinated by rodents. In 1977 the botanists Delbert Wiens and John Patrick Rourke first proposed this pollination method in certain Protea species. After they mature, the seeds stored in the old, dry infructescences which are persistently retained on the branches of the plant. When, after two years or so, the seeds are finally released, they are dispersed by means of the wind. ==Conservation== The conservation status of Protea vogtsiae was first assessed in 1980 as 'indeterminate'. In 1991 the distribution was believed to be restricted to a relatively small area, and Jan Vlok from Cape Nature Conservation stated that most of its habitat had been destroyed by agriculture. He refrained from assigning it a conservation status, however, as he suspected there might be more extant populations than the several he knew of. In 1996 the South African National Botanical Institute, later the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI), assessed the conservation status of the species as 'not threatened' for the Red list of southern African plants, nonetheless it was considered rare in 1998. In 2009 SANBI re-assessed the species as 'least concern', a position they reiterated in the 2019 assessment. The total population numbers are believed to be stable as of 2019. ==See also== * ==References== vogtsiae Category:Flora of the Cape Provinces ","title":"Protea vogtsiae"},{"id":"63903480","text":"Independents gained a majority of the seats, giving them control of the council Elections to the Sutherland District Council took place in May 1988, alongside elections to the councils of Scotland's various other districts.

Military History magazine via HISTORYnet The 36th division, led by Rafael Eitan, broke through the Syrian lines and passed the Purple Line, advancing to Beit Jinn. The following day, the 36th and 210th divisions continued toward Damascus while the Syrian Air Force conducted airstrikes to halt the Israeli advance. These strikes managed to slow the Israeli forces, with nine Syrian and two Israeli aircraft downed in aerial dogfights and anti-aircraft fire. An expeditionary force of the Iraqi army, which had arrived at the front a day earlier, opened a counteroffensive against two Israeli divisions in Syrian territory. The battle lasted until the following day and halted the advance of the 210th division, which had to reposition its forces to meet the Iraqi attack., Dunstan, Simon: The Yom Kippur War: The Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War of 1973 link=Special:FilePath/1973_Yom_Kippur_War_-_Golan_heights_theater.jpg On October 13, the Syrian air force continued its efforts to neutralize the Israeli threat to Damascus, launching more than 100 strikes on Israeli units.

Report in the Middle East as of 1200 EDT, October 23, 1973, Department of State Operations Center During this time, the 210th Israeli division ambushed Iraqi forces with some success. On the morning of October 16, a combined Syrian, Iraqi, and Jordanian armoured force attacked Israeli forces in the Salient, with the Syrians attacking from the north, the Iraqis from the east, and the 40th Jordanian armoured division from the southeast. This attack was repelled by the Israeli forces. As a result of the constant attack in an exposed Salient, the Israeli forces abandoned their plan to continue their push toward Damascus. From October 19th to 20th, the Salient perimeter experienced continuous fighting between the opposing sides.Aloni, Shlomo: Arab‚ÄìIsraeli Air Wars, 1947‚Äì82 On the night of October 21, Israeli forces captured the Hermon outposts in a dual operation.

At the same time, fighters of a reserve paratrooper brigade captured the Syrian outpost near the summit. This summit outpost was held until the armistice despite numerous Syrian attempts to retake it. The Syrians prepared for a massive counteroffensive, scheduled to occur on October 23, to drive Israeli forces out of Syria. A total of five Syrian divisions were to take part, alongside the Iraqi and Jordanian expeditionary forces. The day before the offensive was to begin, the United Nations imposed a ceasefire following the acquiescence of both Israel and Egypt. Ultimately, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad decided to cancel the offensive. On October 23, the day the offensive was to begin, Syria announced it had accepted the ceasefire and ordered its troops to cease hostilities. The Iraqi government ordered its forces home. The central area of the Salient in 2018. == Attrition == The Syrians, refusing to accept the presence of Israeli military forces in their territory, continued to harass the IDF during early 1974, with almost daily attacks. By March 1974, the conflict had become a war of attrition subsequently deemed in Israel as the \\"War of Attrition in the Bashan Salient\\" or the \\"Little War of Attrition\\" (to differentiate it from the War of Attrition fought between Israel and Egypt in 1969-1970). The Syrian army mainly employed artillery bombardments with some attacks by armoured and infantry units also taking place. Between March and May 1974, more than 1,000 such incidents had occurred with some Israeli civilian settlements in the Golan Heights also coming under Syrian fire. The fighting took place alongside armistice negotiations, which started in February 1974 with U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger serving as a go-between. An armistice agreement was finally signed on May 31, 1974, with the Israelis evacuating the Salient shortly after and UN peacekeeping forces taking a position on a thin strip of land between the opposing sides. This agreement is still in place today, and the Syrian-Israeli border is among the quietest of Israel's frontiers. == References == Category:Yom Kippur War Category:Populated places in Syria ","title":"Bashan salient"},{"id":"63903495","text":"Lilygreen is a surname.

The strike began on January 22, 2019, after nearly two years of failed contract negotiations between the AAUP and the Wright State University administration. The strike ended on February 10, 2019. At a length of twenty days, it was one of the longest faculty strikes in the history of U.S. higher education. University President Cheryl B. Schrader received widespread criticism for her handling of the strike and stepped down from her position as a result. ==Background== ==Lead-up to Strike== ==Strike== On January 22, 2019, following almost two years of failed contract negotiations and unexpected employment conditions imposed by the administration, the Wright State chapter of the American Association of University Professors began a strike that would ultimately become the second-longest public university strike in U.S. history. Most of the 560 unionized faculty participated in the strike. Striking faculty and other supporters picketed entrances to the university. Protesters chanted for resumed negotiations, and for Schrader \\"to go.\\" The strike received national attention, and the faculty union garnered widespread support from other universities, alumni, and lawmakers. Many letters of support were addressed to Schrader personally. Schrader and her administration ultimately received much criticism for how the stike was handled, especially after the faculty union ended up getting many of their demands. Schrader had remained publicly optimistic in the face of the strike, downplaying the liklihood of the strike and its potential impact on the university. She gave the assurance that \\"classes will continue\\" during the strike, with the caveat that some might be \\"consolidated.\\" When the strike began, Schrader kept the university running, instructing students to \\"go to class,\\" even as an online petition called for her resignation. Schrader reportedly took over teaching two courses herself. Despite such efforts made by the university, there were widespread reports from students that their classes had no instructors, or that \\"covered\\" classes provided minimal or inadequate instruction. The effect of the strike on the students was apparently profound, as reflected in social media posts. Many students expressed frustration about being \\"caught in the middle\\" between the striking faculty and the administration. Some students said they felt betrayed by the university; others expressed concern about the effect the strike was having on the reputation of the institution and how it would affect the value of their degree. One student said students were being \\"bombarded with information\\". Messages to students were later described as \\"confusing and sometimes intimidating.\\" A number of students joined the picket lines alongside the faculty, although they were reportedly discouraged from doing so by threats against their financial aid. Near the end of the strike, the AAUP chapter president said between 75 and 250 students picketing with the striking faculty every day. There were also independent protests by students. Two separate student protests were held outside Schrader's office. The second, which occurred on day 16 of the strike, was a round-the-clock \\"sit-in\\" by some 30 students. The students had a list of demands, which included tuition reimbursement for course time lost. The demonstration ended after 42 hours, when Schrader agreed to meet with the students. Throughout the strike, Schrader and the administration continued to publicly downplay the impact it was having on the university, maintaining that 80 percent of classes were covered. A February 6 statement added that the number was \\"climbing\\" as more union faculty returned to the classroom. The faculty union disputed this, noting all the problems that they're having just running basic classes.‚Äù Some university statements did indeed seem inconsistent with university actions. On the third day of the strike, Schrader stated the university was \\"open and operating largely without issue,\\" in spite of the widespread student complaints. That same day her administration filed a complaint with the Ohio State Employee Relations Board (SERB) asking that the strike be declared illegal. When the board ruled that the strike could continue, she stated that the union's actions were \\"having a significant toll.\\" As the strike entered its third week, the true impact of the strike became more evident. The university advertized nationally for \\"long term\\" adjunct faculty in more than 80 fields, apparently to replace striking faculty. The school also began cancelling some \\"specialized\\" courses, which affected advanced students near graduation. It was reported that approximately 3,500 students had been affected by cancelled classes. While the university offered advising sessions to affected students, the faculty union asked Ohio Governor Mike DeWine to intervene, citing a belief that the administration was \\"losing touch with reality.\\" The faculty union became increasingly vocal in their accusations of \\"union busting.\\" === Deal to End the Strike === With pressure mounting to end the strike, and no deal in sight, a federal negotiator was brought in. On Sunday February 10, day 20 of the strike, after a long weekend of negotiating, the faculty union and the administration negotiators reached a tentative agreement to end the strike. The faculty returned to work on Monday February 11. \\"Both parties made substantial concessions to help move the university forward together,\\" Schrader said. The faculty union admitted it made some \\"serious financial concessions,\\" such as agreeing to no pay raises until 2021, but kept protections on job security, workload, merit pay, and perhaps most significantly, the right to bargain over health care. On the whole, the faculty union hailed the agreement and considered the strike a success. ==Aftermath== ==Notes== ==References== Category:2019 labor disputes and strikes Category:Education labor disputes in the United States Category:Labor disputes in Ohio Category:Labor relations in Ohio ","title":"Wright State University 2019 faculty strike"},{"id":"63903661","text":"is a Japanese former Nippon Professional Baseball outfielder. == References == Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Baseball people from Okinawa Prefecture Category:Japanese baseball players Category:Nippon Professional Baseball outfielders Category:Hankyu Braves players Category:Orix Braves players Category:Orix BlueWave players Category:Hanshin Tigers players Category:Japanese baseball coaches Category:Nippon Professional Baseball coaches ","title":"Kazuhiko Ishimine"},{"id":"63903665","text":"Silvia Ikl√© (born 12 January 1949) is a Swiss equestrian.

His great-grandfather ‚Äì the gadyatsky colonel Stepan Troshchinsky ‚Äì was the nephew of hetman Ivan Mazepa. Dmitry's father, Prokofy Troshchinsky, was a Bunchuk comrade in the Hetman country. At the end of the course at the Kiev Academy, Dmitry Troshchinsky joined the Little Russian Collegium. He received the rank of regimental clerk in 1773. Being sent to Moldavia at the disposal of Prince Nikolai Repnin, Troshchinsky soon attracted the attention of the prince, who did not part with him until 1787, by his industriousness and efficiency. This year, Catherine II took a trip to the Crimea; she was accompanied by Count Alexander Bezborodko. Prince Repnin recommended to him Troshchinsky, as a reliable and experienced official. In 1793, Troshchinsky was appointed a member of the Main Post Office and elevated to the rank of Secretary of State. This gave him the opportunity to attract the attention of Catherine II. In 1796, he received from the empress the town of Kagarlyk in the Kiev Governorate, the entire Kagarlyk village headquarters, as well as two village headquarters in the Podolsk Governorate. Troshchinsky accompanied emperor Paul I to Moscow for the coronation and was appointed senator and present in the council established at the educational society of noble maidens. In 1800, he was dismissed from all posts and (according to Nathan Eidelman) took part in a conspiracy against Paul I. After the coup of 1801, he was reinstated in all posts and appointed by Emperor Alexander I a member of the Permanent State Council and head of the Postal Directorate of the empire, and when the ministries were established, he became the Minister of Allotments. Troshchinsky is also known for the fact that he wrote the famous manifesto on the accession to the throne of Alexander I, in which the tsar abdicated the policies of Paul I and solemnly vowed \\"to rule by God, as the people handed over to us according to the laws and in the heart of God, the honourable grandmother of our sovereign Empress Catherine the Great\\". Skobeeva (her name is unknown) ‚Äì daughter of the Kronstadt sailor, pupil and favorite of Dmitry Troshchinsky Troshchinsky held the post of Minister of Allotments from 1802 to 1806, then he retired and moved to live in the village of Kibintsy, Mirgorod Uyezd. The Poltava nobility chose him as the provincial marshal. From 1814 to 1817, Troshchinsky was the Minister of Justice. Having retired, he remained in Saint Petersburg for about five years, and then moved to Kibintsy, where he gathered the local landowners. Among the latter were the Gogol‚ÄìYanovsky family, the relatives of Troshchinsky by brother. Thanks to Troshchinsky, Nikolai Gogol was enrolled in the Nizhyn gymnasium. He had extensive possessions in the Poltava Region, the Kiev Region, in Podolia and the Voronezh Province (over 70,000 dessiatins). In last years, Troshchinsky lived in his Khorbintsy estate in Mirgorod. He was a friend and patron of many Ukrainian writers and artists, in particular Vasily Kapnist, Pavel Koropchevsky, Miklashevsky, Yakov Markevich, Vasily Lomikovsky, Vasily Gogol, Vladimir Borovikovsky, Artemy Vedel. Through his friend Osip Kamenetsky, Troshchinsky was one of the initiators of the first edition of the Aeneid by Ivan Kotlyarevsky (1798). In Kibintsy, Troshchinsky had a home theater, which he directed from 1812 with the help of Vasily Kapnist and Vasily Gogol- Yanovsky. Troshchinsky collected a rich library, sold in parts after his death in different hands. He died of \\"dropsy in the chest\\" on February 26, 1829 in Kibintsy, leaving a very significant condition: 6 thousand souls of serfs, a house in Petersburg and Kiev, movable property worth about 1 million rubles.Russian Antiquity. 1882.

Their daughter Praskovya Ivanovna (1804‚Äì1829) became the wife (1827) of Major General Baron Stanislav Karlovich Osten-Saken (1789‚Äì1863). According to a contemporary, Troshchinsky \\"loved her granddaughter dearly, meanwhile, she was completely convinced that she was his only heiress and eagerly expected what her fate would be decided.

It has a small, slightly oblique mouth which does not reach as far back as the eye. The teeth are villiform and are arranged in bands in each jaw, with the outer row of teeth being much larger than the inner rows and there are no teeth on the roof of the mouth. The dorsal fin contains 12 spines and 9-11 soft rays and the spiny part is arched,the third to sixth spines being the longest. The anal fin has 3 spines and 7-9 soft rays. There are 60-75 pored scales in the lateral line. The body is grey on the back and silvery below with 4 rather blotchy dark brown or black longitudinal stripes along the body and some specimens have irregular stripes between these stripes. The base of the spiny part of the dorsal fin is coloured dusky, as is the margin while the soft-rayed part is banded. The juveniles have clear caudal fin lobes but in the adults there are several narrow, irregular, parallel stripes on each lobe. the maximum total length is . ==Distribution== The sharpbeak terapon is found in the wwestern Pacific Ocean in southern Japan, Taiwan, southern China and the Philippines. ==Habitat and biology== The sharpbeak terapon occurs in inshore waters, frequently in brackish waters too. The juveniles will enter freshwater. It is a carnivorous species which feeds on invertebrates and fishes. After spawning the males guard the eggs and fan them. ==Fisheries== Sharpbeak terapons are fished for using traps, handlines and other inshore fishing gear. It is grown in commercial aquaculture in Japan. ==Species description== The sharpbeak terapon was first formally described as Therapon oxyrhynchus in 1842 by Coenraad Jacob Temminck & Hermann Schlegel with the type locality given as the basy of southern Japan.

It is the headquarters of Merton London Borough Council. ==History== The main building was originally commissioned on a speculative basis by a developer, Bernard Sunley & Sons, for use as commercial offices and for postal sorting. The site selected had previously been occupied by a large post office and some other shops. As part of the site redevelopment a public house known as \\"The Crown\\", on an adjacent site to the east, was demolished and subsequently replaced with a supermarket. The new building, which was designed by A. Green in the Modernist style, opened as \\"Crown House\\" in 1962. The design involved a 15-storey curved structure with layers of continuous concrete panels above and below a continuous row of glass windows on each floor: the whole structure was high. Many of the council officers of the London Borough of Merton and their departments, which had previously been located at Wimbledon Town Hall, moved into the building in 1985. After civic leaders decided to co-locate all their operations at Morden, and to use it as their meeting place as well, the adjacent site to the east which had previously been occupied by a supermarket was acquired for expansion. This expansion was implemented by the construction of a new three-storey block in front of the main structure: the design for the extension was more angular than the curved structure behind and involved a symmetrical frontage of seven bays facing onto the junction of Crown Lane and London Road; it featured a portico with a canopy on the ground floor and a tall oriel window stretching up from the first floor to second floor. This extension contained a council chamber and a public library enabling the expanded complex to become the new Civic Centre for Merton in 1990. A major programme of refurbishment works to replace all the windows in the main structure with aluminium double-glazing was completed in spring 2014. The Merton Heritage & Local Studies Centre, which was established to exhibit aspects of the history and culture of the area, moved onto the first floor of the new library area in 2009. In 2015 the Merton Heritage & Local Studies Centre hosted a series of \\"War Story Days\\" to meet with residents and record their experiences from the First World War for a new project entitled \\"Carved in Stone\\", material from which was published on the centre's website.

She opened up R√∏nneb√¶ksholm to religious revivalists, attracting both clerics and laymen to the estate. In 1851, she married the influential philosopher, N. F. S. Grundtvig, who had visited the estate in 1846. Her manor house subsequently became one of the principal centres of Grundtvigian activity while Grundtvig became deeply devoted to Toft, treating her as his independent and spiritually equal partner. R√∏nneb√¶ksholm ==Biography== Born on 4 April 1813 in the Gammel K√∏geg√•rd manor near K√∏ge, Ane Marie Elise Carlsen was the daughter of the estate owner and farmer Christen Rasmus Carlsen (1777‚Äì1818) and Else Margrethe Nyhuus (1792‚Äì1857). She was brought up on the estate together with her younger sister Franziska (1817‚Äì1876), who became a historian, and her elder brother Hans (1810‚Äì1887), a politician. When she was 26, on 9 June 1840, she married Harald Peter Nicolai Toft (1812‚Äì1841) who bought the R√∏nneb√¶ksholm estate a few weeks later on 16 July. He carried out repairs and had the main building rebuilt. Harald Toft, who had earlier suffered from a serious chest infection in Paris, died on 24 November 1841. The couple had spent only nine months together at R√∏nneb√¶ksholm. Their daughter Haralda was born after her father's death on 17 February 1842. Following her husband's death, Toft inherited the manor house and continued to live there with her daughter. She took good care of the building and the estate, efficiently managing the farming work. She also improved the living conditions of her tenants, allowing some to acquire the properties in which they were living. She became a popular figure in the area, thanks to her friendly, welcoming attitude and her unusual sophistication. As a widow interested in religious revival, she became a figurehead for revivalists in southern Zealand, both commoners and clerics. Her large religious meetings at R√∏nneb√¶ksholm in collaboration with the parish priest of Herf√∏lge, J.W. Willemoes, were large enough to annoy Bishop J.P. Mynster. The Venligheden (friendship) pavilion In the winter of 1845‚Äì46, Toft visited Grundtvig at his home in Copenhagen together with his former student Willimoes. Given the bishops attitude, she was keen to hear his views on revival meetings, especially those at R√∏nneb√¶ksholm. Their discussion was inconclusive but she had obviously impressed Grundtvig, making a further meeting inevitable. This occurred the following autumn, in connection with an address by Grundtvig in N√¶stved. Grundtvig made several more visits to R√∏nneb√¶ksholm, contributing to its attraction as a focus for religious meetings. His affection for Toft grew steadily but he was unable to marry her as long as his wife Lise was living. After being bedridden for several months, Lise died in January 1851. Grundtvig was therefore able to marry Toft on 21 October 1851 in Br√∏ndbyvester Church. He was 67 and Toft was still only 37. Toft built a pavilion for him near the R√∏nneb√¶ksholm manor where he could work. She called it \\"Venligheden\\" (friendship). The couple enjoyed a happy marriage, as can be seen from the love poem \\"Hvad er det, min Marie\\" he wrote for her. Their marriage did not last long. After giving birth to their son Frederik on 15 May, she died of breast cancer two months later on 9 July 1854 in Copenhagen. Following her own wishes, she was entombed in the grounds of Gammel K√∏gegaard. When he died 18 years later following a third marriage, Grundtvig was entombed beside her. Grundtvig named his first folk high school Marielyst in her memory. Opened in 1856, it was initially located in Copenhagen. ==References== Category:1813 births Category:1854 deaths Category:People from K√∏ge Municipality Category:19th-century Danish women landowners Category:19th-century Danish landowners Category:Christianity and women ","title":"Marie Toft"},{"id":"63904060","text":"Medemsand island was a small island of Germany in the mouth of the Elbe on the Schleswig-Holstein coast opposite Otterndorf (Lower Saxony), where the Medem river flows into the Elbe.

According to Manu, marriage within the same caste, that is, between two persons who belong to the same rung in the ladder, is excellent. Anuloma marriages are considered as \\"going with the grain\\" unions. As per Hindu scriptures, Anuloma marriages or unions are not advocated but were tolerated and accepted historically. On the other hand, the reverse union called Pratiloma marriages, where a high born woman unites with a man of low birth (relative to the woman) was condemned. Manu bitterly criticises and condemns these unions which were considered as \\"going against the hair or grain\\" and holds them responsible for the degeneration of the parties involved, subsequent to the union.

In 1895, Lauda was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Hydrographic Central Office in Vienna. In 1909, Lauda became head of the hydraulic engineering department at the Ministry of Public Works. In his role, he helped regulate the Danube river, which was prone to flooding.

He was a supporter of G√°sp√°r Bekes, a claimant to throne of Transylvania in the 1570s. ==Family== Ferenc (III) was born into a wealthy Transylvanian noble family as the son of Mih√°ly IV Barlab√°ssy (born 1515) and Katalin Tomori, daughter of Istv√°n Tomori, the Vice-voivode of Transylvania from 1523 to 1526 and from 1528 to 1531, and niece of P√°l Tomori, commander- in-chief of the Hungarian army in the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526, where he was killed. Mih√°ly and his family lived in Alpar√©t (present-day Bob√¢lna, Romania), where his ancestors erected a country-house. Ferenc was also born there around 1540. ==Career== After his father, Mih√°ly died in 1555, Ferenc became the last offspring of the Barlab√°ssy's senior branch, descending from his great- grandfather J√°nos III. Therefore, he inherited large-scale landholdings throughout Transylvania, including Cs√≠kfalva (VƒÉrgata) and Kutyfalva (Cuci). Ferenc Barlab√°ssy supported the policy of John Sigismund Z√°polya, King-elect of Hungary and later the first Prince of Transylvania. Under his influence, Barlab√°ssy was one of those Transylvanian lords, who converted to Unitarianism from Roman Catholicism in the 1560s. John Sigismund died in 1571. The Transylvanian Diet elected the Roman Catholic lord, Stephen B√°thory as his successor with the title of voivode. G√°sp√°r Bekes, also sponsored by Emperor Maximilian II contested the election. Barlab√°ssy supported the claim of Bekes, a fellow Unitarian. Bekes gathered his army and organized a rebellion against B√°thory. Barlab√°ssy joined his army, leading the troops of the Sz√©kelys of Marossz√©k. In his letter to captain L√°szl√≥ Rad√°k in 1575, Bekes called Barlab√°ssy as head of all Sz√©kelys within his party. Ferenc Barlab√°ssy was isolated in his family due to his political orientation. The members of the younger branch of his kinship, descending from Vice-voivode L√©n√°rd Barlab√°ssy, were considered partisans of Stephen B√°thory, primarily Farkas Barlab√°ssy, who also owned estates in Sz√©kely Land and participated in the civil war in B√°thory's retinue. The decisive battle took place near Kerel≈ëszentp√°l (S√¢npaul) on 9 July 1575, where G√°sp√°r Bekes was defeated. Barlab√°ssy gathered his army and was en route to the battlefield, but missed the battle and arrived to the scene one day later. Supporters of Bekes were brutally suppressed and privileges for the Sz√©kelys were suspended. Ferenc Barlab√°ssy sought refuge in the castle of Szatm√°r (Satu Mare). Along with 32 other lords, he was sentenced to death in absentia and his landholdings and villages were confiscated by a tribunal at the diet of Kolozsv√°r (Cluj-Napoca) in August 1575. G√°sp√°r Bekes decided to reconcile with B√°thory and became his loyal ally and close adviser, when the latter was elected monarch of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in the spring of 1576. Among other pro-Bekes lords, Barlab√°ssy was granted amnesty and he was able to recover his confiscated lands. He also swore loyalty to Stephen B√°thory. Barlab√°ssy remained a partisan of the B√°thory family throughout his life but lost all political influence, retiring to his country-house at Alpar√©t. He was also considered a partisan of Prince Sigismund B√°thory. When Emperor Rudolf II's military commander Michael the Brave invaded Transylvania in 1599, the province was harassed from pillaging raids made by his unpaid soldiers, while Ottoman marauders made frequent incursions across the frontiers. Ferenc Barlab√°ssy was slaughtered together with his unidentified wife and children, while the contry-house at Alpar√©t was looted and destroyed. ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:1540s births Category:1599 deaths Category:16th- century Hungarian people Category:Hungarian Unitarians Category:Converts to Unitarianism from Catholicism Category:Hungarian murder victims Ferenc Category:People from Cluj County ","title":"Ferenc Barlab√°ssy"},{"id":"63904382","text":"David Fisher (4 July 1871 ‚Äì 1 October 1932) was a Scotland international rugby union player. ==Rugby Union career== ===Amateur career=== Fisher played rugby union for West of Scotland.Scotland.

There are three Pelton-type turbines each rated at . One was installed on the Ndizi River, during the first phase. Due to the water flow rates on this small river, only 1.65 megawatts could be extracted.

The son of Edward Hill, he was born in July 1913 at Bradfield, Berkshire. He educated in the village at Bradfield College, before going up to Oriel College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he played first-class cricket for Oxford University, making his debut against Southgate in 1867. He played first-class cricket for Oxford until 1870, making ten appearances. Hill scored a total of 300 runs in his ten matches for Oxford, at an average of 20.00 and a high score of 73. With his right-arm roundarm medium bowling, he took 9 wickets with best figures of 2 for 2. In addition to playing first-class cricket for Oxford, he also made a single appearance for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Cambridge University at Fenner's in 1871, top-scoring with 59 runs in the MCC second innings. After graduating from Oxford, Hill was briefly employed as an assistant master at Bromsgrove School, before taking holy orders in the Church of England in 1873.

Baloo was named as one of the top 100 CISO's in 2017, and one of Forbes 100 Women Founders in Europe To Follow in 2018. == Life and career == Baloo studied at Tufts University between 1991‚Äì1995. She was inspired to study computers after receiving one for Christmas at the age of nine. Baloo's first job was working at a bank dealing with export cryptography problems. She was surprised how cryptography was treated as a \\"weapon\\", with the USA hiding their security advances from the rest of the world. She had an interest in understanding the difference between mistakes in programming and malicious activity. After graduating Baloo became a network services engineer and consultant at KPN International Consultancy before specialising in fraud and revenue assurance for France Telecom between 2005‚Äì2009. Baloo then worked at Verizon for nearly 4 years. Baloo believes that the goal of telecommunication attackers is not to bring down services but to shape and intercept traffic without discovery, notably different that attacks on other critical infrastructure like energy or water. In 2012 Baloo became the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at KPN Telecom, a Dutch internet service provider, in the same year that KPN was hacked. During this time Baloo was chairman of the Dutch Continuity Board, which is a collaboration tackling denial-of-service (DDos) cyberthreats through exchanging live attack information between competitors. In an interview with the podcast Cyber Security Dispatch, it was highlighted that Baloo's length of tenure at KPN was considerably longer than the 18-month to 2 year average. She was named as one of the top 100 CISO's in 2017, with only 9 other women named. In 2018, Forbes named Baloo as one of 100 Women Founders in Europe To Follow. In October 2019 Baloo took on her current role as CISO for Avast. One reason why she joined Avast is her love of their mission to ensure \\"that cybersecurity is a fundamental right. It‚Äôs not just for people who can afford to pay for a product ‚Äì it's for everyone\\". Baloo holds a faculty position at the Singularity University. She is also a quantum ambassador of KPN Telecom and Vice Chair of the Quantum Flagship Strategic Advisory Board of the EU Commission. She considers quantum computers as inevitable tools that will disrupt current computing architectures, recommending that businesses and organisations prepare themselves for the impact of new quantum protocols. Among her recommendations are to increase key length of current algorithms, use quantum key distribution in niche part of the network, and look at post quantum cryptographic algorithms. Baloo projects that the most exciting development in quantum communication will be beyond the current point-to-point into many-to-many, on demand, instantly. This requires quantum repeaters and other architecture in a managed service, which Baloo predicts could be achieved in 5‚Äì10 years' time. Baloo is interested in the future of cyber security and how quantum computing may impact privacy. She is an expert in network architecture, security weaknesses in mobile and voice-over-IP, cyrotography, and quantum communication networks. In 2019, the non-profit Inspiring Fifty selected Baloo as one of the fifty most inspiring women in the Netherlands. Baloo considers inequality and distribution of assets as one of the biggest global cyberthreats, with only a handful of countries able to detect, respond or defend against threats. On quantum computing, Baloo comments: > \\"You see that happening at Microsoft, at Google, at IBM, the United States > is investing heavily in it [quantum computing], China has billions of > dollars in it...But the rest of the world certainly doesn‚Äôt. You‚Äôre not > hearing of a quantum computer or post quantum cryptography being developed > in Brazil or in Kenya. What I‚Äôm worried about from an infosec point of view, > is that when we have a quantum computer, it‚Äôs going to effectively render > our current encryption schemes for public key cryptography moot....So if we > see an evolution where only certain countries will be able to possess this > kind of technology, all of the other countries will be in this ‚Äòdigital > divide‚Äô that the UN always talks about.\\" Baloo's advice for women in cybersecurity is to \\"Hold onto your passion, and don't shut yourself down. We need you in this industry. Help us keep the world safe\\". Baloo has three children. In her spare time she enjoys diving, having dived at the Great Barrier Reef and in the Bahamas, and would consider becoming a diving instructor as an alternative occupation. Baloo is also training for a pilot license. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Baloo has been providing tips for best home working practices on behalf of Avast. == References == Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Computer security specialists Category:Tufts University alumni ","title":"Jaya Baloo"},{"id":"63904531","text":"A Day in Black and White may refer to: * A Day in Black and White (band), American band * A Day in Black and White (film), American film ","title":"A Day in Black and White"},{"id":"63904535","text":"is a Japanese former Nippon Professional Baseball pitcher. == References == Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:Baseball people from Hiroshima Prefecture Category:Japanese baseball players Category:Nippon Professional Baseball pitchers category:Yokohama Taiy≈ç Whales players Category:Yokohama BayStars players Category:Japanese baseball coaches Category:Nippon Professional Baseball coaches ","title":"Hiroki Nomura"},{"id":"63904538","text":"Re≈æanci () is a village in Croatia. ==Notable people from Re≈æanci== * Ivan Milovan (born 1940), Roman Catholic prelate ==References== Category:Populated places in Istria County ","title":"Re≈æanci"},{"id":"63904539","text":"Transilvania Motor Ring is a 3.7 km racing circuit located 20 km south‚Äìwest of T√¢rgu Mure»ô, in the historical region of Transylvania.

Quibell, 3 . The tomb became known as the Magician‚Äôs Tomb or Tomb 5. However, the name is misleading because the discovery of the box was found in a magazine labeled 5. The exact location of the tomb is unknown, because no traces of it could be located from the map written by Quibell. Downing & Parkinson, 36-37 Magic was an important component in Ancient Egyptian culture. Nevertheless, scholars understand very little about Egyptian magical practices. The magician‚Äôs box is an important discovery because it is the most complete collection found for this profession. The items in the box provide a better context of magic in Ancient Egypt. Ritner, 222-231 ==Archaeological context== Ramesseum site The tomb contained items from dynasties after the Ramessid period, indicating it was reused. There are a few shabtis from the 22nd Dynasty found near the beginning of the shaft. It appears that the tomb had been robbed during antiquity but the bottom portion was left untouched. At the bottom of the tomb‚Äôs shaft, 3.9 meters down, Quibell and Petrie found a heap of debris that covered a small space of .6m sq, in the wall. This space contained a wooden box, 45.75 x 30.5 x 30.5 cm, covered in white plaster. A crude drawing of a jackal appears on the lid of the box. The animal might be a symbol for the magician‚Äôs title, Master of Secrets, which has been depicted as a jackal. Another possibility is that the jackal had a funerary context as it was buried in a tomb. Unfortunately, the exact location of the box is unknown, so further research is halted until it is found. Downing and Parkinson, 46-47 This emphasizes the importance of proper documentation of artefacts before they arrive at a museum. Within the box were papyri containing medical/magical texts, reed pens, and many different magically related items. These include ivory wands, a wooden female figure, an ivory figure of a boy carrying a calf, a bronze Uraeus wand entangled in hair, tiny beads, and seeds. About one-third of the papyri was not preserved, but some of the remaining texts have been translated and a large portion pertains to childbirth. The person buried here may have specialized in aiding both pregnant women and children, as many items pertain to birth magic practices. Morris, 314 Petrie donated the tomb contents to the Manchester Museum, Fitzwilliam Museum, Penn Museum, and Egyptian Museum of Berlin. Quibell mentions in his notes that he believes the box would have been full when it was buried, concluding that it had most likely been disturbed at some point in antiquity. Parkinson, Because the items in the box have been scattered around the world, understanding the box in its complete context has been difficult for scholars. ==Ramesseum Papyri== Papyrus, Ramesseum Box. British Museum Reeds, Ramesseum Box. Berlin Museum Magic wand #1801; The Manchester Museum Collection Database Magic wand #1795; Display Magic wand #1795 H 12cm, L 2.5cm, W 2.7cm. This piece was a part of an ivory rod. It has two recumbent lions carved on each side. The top part of the rod is lost. Magic rods consist of individual segments that are joined by dowels. There are other examples from the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, where the rods are made of steatite. Robins, 114 The main discovery in the box is the papyri and the reed pens, which were probably used to write the texts. The text is written in hieratic, with a structure of horizontal and vertical lines. The papyri is mostly in fragments and conservation efforts have been used to save what remains. The papyri fragments were taken to the University College London, where Petrie and Percy Newberry unrolled some of the text onto glass, and used beeswax, in an attempt to hold the fragmentary pieces together. Brier, 47 Alan Gardiner disagreed with this method and convinced Petrie to send the papyri to Hugo Ibscher in Berlin. Ibscher's conservation work took place in both London and Berlin. He laid some of the texts onto gelatin and placed them between two pieces of glass. Gardiner and Ibscher catalogued and numbered the papyri for the British Museum and the Berlin Egyptian Museum. Some of the papyri are almost complete, but many are in fragments. It cannot be determined how many rolls were originally placed in the box. Parkinson, Ramesseum Papyri The texts contain different spells ranging from medical care, protection of children, and charms for daily life protection. There are also copies of hymns to Sobek and for the coronation of King Senusret I, suggesting this magician also served as a high priest. As the magician possessed a copy of the wisdom texts, it appears that they were well educated. Raven, 77 There are similar papyri that were discovered by Petrie at the Kahuen site, implying that protective magic for children and women were common. Morris, 318-319 ==Wands== Wands (also called birth tusk) were important during childbirth as a form of protection. Women, on average, lived two to four years less than men because of complications during labor. Because of this, many spells and amulets were created to protect women and children. Redford, 193 The wands are always made of hippo ivory for symbolic purposes. The god Set and the goddess Taweret (protective Egyptian goddess of childbirth and fertility) are associated with this power. The display of powerful animals was meant to allow the person to channel these powers. Taweret‚Äôs image can be seen on many magic wands along with other protection gods. Morris, 320 Jackals are also sometimes seen on the wands because they are correlated with fertility. Sabbahy, 414 Four ivory wands were discovered in the magician‚Äôs box. All are similar in size and material, but images on the wands vary. Magic wand #1801: L 15cm, W 4.6cm. The artefact is broken into two pieces. The surface is engraved with different animals, a snake, a frog, a cat, and a jackal. It also contains a few mythical creatures, a sun disk with legs, and a winged griffin with a human head. There are two small holes at the end, possibly used to attach a handle or for suspension. Hippo ivory is connected to the goddess Tawaret. There are reshaping patterns on the end of the wand, indicating it was used before being placed in the tomb. Haworth, Manchester Museum ===Boy carrying calf=== Statuary - E13405  Collections - Penn Museum E13405, H 3.17cm, L 7.62cm, W 1.91cm Penn Museum . This piece is made of hippo ivory. Little research on this statute has been completed, but the figurine appears similar to an Old Kingdom painting from the tomb of Ti. The scene depicts a boy carrying a calf across the water, so that the cattle will follow him. Scenes similar to this have \\"water spells\\" associated with them. This statute might have been a substitute for the actual spell. There are magical texts that refer to agriculture and herdsmen in the magic-related Papyrus Harris 501, meaning this figurine might be related in this context. Ritner, 225-231 ===Female figure=== Female figure, Manchester Museum A wooden figurine of a naked masked woman was found in the tomb. The figure, 1790, 20.2 cm , was originally painted yellow for the skin and black for her hair but the colors have faded. The woman holds two serpents made of metal in her hands. Her arms are separate pieces that are attached by pegs. She wears a lion's mask and looks similar to the images on the magic wands. This could possibly be a reference to the god Aha or Beset. There is a small hole on her forehead, where there was once an attachment of some kind. The base of the figurine had been reshaped during antiquity. Quirke, 206-207 A discovery of magically- related items similar to this box was found in Kahun. Petrie discovered a Beset mask at this site, suggesting that magicians could have taken on the embodiment of this goddess. ===Serpent Wand=== A serpent wand made of bronze and entangled in human hair was found in the box. Serpent wands have been found in tombs from the Late Period. Serpents are considered mysterious and they have connections to both the earthly world and the underworld, Raven, 76 . This wand could be connected to the serpent wands the wooden statuette holds in her hands. Morris, 318 == See also == * Ramesseum medical papyri ==References== == Bibliography == * Brier, Bob.

It is a locally listed building. ==History== The building was commissioned as a vestry hall for the benefit of the Parish of St Peter and St Paul: the site selected for the building had previously been occupied by the local police and fire stations. It was designed by Robert Masters Chart in the Victorian style and was officially opened on 18 May 1887. However, the vestry hall was described, in 1895, as a \\"red brick blot\\"...which had...\\"ruined for ever the picturesqueness of Mitcham of old\\".Barrett, C.R.B. (1895), Surrey Highways and Byways The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage with seven bays facing onto London Road; it featured a doorway with pediment in the furthest right bay with a tall clock tower rising above; there were windows in each of the bays on the first floor; it had a steeply pitched roof with a cupola and weather vane. The old village lock-up which had formed the basement of the old police station was incorporated into the basement of the new building. The design also featured an entrance for the fire engine in the furthest left bay: the horse-drawn fire engine fire engine itself was replaced with an appliance made by Merryweather & Sons in 1912. Urban expansion saw the immediate area become the geographical and administrative centre of the developing township in the late 19th century and the building became the council offices for the new Mitcham Urban District Council in 1915. A large extension to the west was completed in 1930 and, after the area achieved municipal borough status, the building became known as \\"Mitcham Town Hall\\" in 1934. A room on the first floor of the extension was designated for use as a courtroom in the 1930s and the main hall was used as a British Restaurant during the Second World War. The building continued to serve as the headquarters of the Municipal Borough of Mitcham but ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged London Borough of Merton was formed in 1965. It was subsequently used as workspace by several departments of Merton Council including the Borough Treasurer's Department. However, after the council departments moved out in the 1980s, the building was refurnished and was revived as a community centre known as the \\"Vestry Hall\\". The building continues to be used for public meetings and, in September 2014, the local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group held its first Annual General meeting there. The Wandle Industrial Museum, which was established at Worsfold House in Church Road in Mitcham in June 1983 to preserve artifacts associated with the River Wandle and its industrial heritage, moved to the annex in the grounds of the vestry hall in July 1989. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Merton Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1887 ","title":"Mitcham Vestry Hall"},{"id":"63904639","text":"Amaury Apolinar Filion Fern√°ndez (born August 1, 1981) is a Dominican former professional basketball player.

In 2000, he was named the CIF Division II co- Player of the Year together with Marques Crane of Ocean View High School. While in high school he played alongside Jason Kapono and fellow Dominican Jack Michael Mart√≠nez. In early 2000, it was reported that Filion, together with teammates Mart√≠nez and Jon Steffenson, were to leave Artesia due to issues with their immigration documents submitted to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Artesia was put under investigation. Filion ended up going back to the Dominican Republic, where he signed with Mauricio B√°ez, a local professional team. == Professional career == Filion had started his career in 1997 with Mauricio B√°ez, a club of Santo Domingo which participated in the Baloncesto Superior del Distrito Nacional, the basketball league for clubs of the Distrito Nacional. From 1998 to early 2000, he was in the United States with Artesia High School; he then returned to the Dominican Republic and played again for Mauricio B√°ez, winning the Distrito Nacional league title. In 2001 and 2002 he played for Cupes de Los Pepines, a club of the Baloncesto Superior de Santiago, the local league for teams of the Santiago de los Caballeros area; in 2002 he also played with Metros de Santiago, and was named one of the league's best players. In 2003 he initially played with Cupes de Los Pepines, and then moved to Puerto Rico, signing for Gallitos de Isabela: in the 2003 season he appeared in 19 games and averaged 17.8 points, 7.2 rebounds and 1.8 assists in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional. In late 2003 he signed for JA Vichy of the LNB Pro A, the top level of basketball in France: he played 8 games (5 starts), averaging 8.4 points, 5 rebounds and 1.1 assists in 23.5 minutes of playing time. In 2004 he went back to Puerto Rico and signed with Criollos de Caguas, another BSN team, and averaged 11.5 points, 4.9 rebounds and 0.9 assists in 18 games. In 2005 he played for Sameji in the Baloncesto Superior de Santiago, winning the league title and being named in the All-Star team; he scored 23 points in the 7th and final game of the championship series against Club Domingo Paulino. He later played with Metros de Santiago in the first edition of the LIDOBA, the Dominican national basketball league, and averaged 15.5 points, 8.7 rebounds, 3.6 steals and 1.8 blocks per game. In 2006 he played the first part of the season with Sameji, and repeated as Baloncesto Superior de Santiago league champion; he then played in the LIDOBA with Metros de Santiago. In 2007 he played for Don Bosco of the Asociaci√≥n de Baloncesto de Espaillat (ASOBAE), and then for Guaiquer√≠es de Margarita in the Venezuelan Liga Profesional de Baloncesto (LPB), winning the league title. In 2008 he played for San Sebasti√°n in the ASOBAE, and then moved to Uruguay where he played in the Liga Uruguaya de B√°squetbol (LUB) with Bohemios. In 2009 he spent the season with San Mart√≠n de Porres in San Francisco de Macor√≠s, Don Bosco in the ASOBAE, and Sameji in the Baloncesto Superior de Santiago. In 2010 he played for Huellas del Siglo, and was league champion in the Distrito Nacional. He also played with Metros de Santiago, later in 2010. In 2011 he spent part of the season with San Sebasti√°n, before going back to Metros de Santiago. In 2012 he returned to Venezuela, signing again for Guaiquer√≠es de Margarita. In 2013 he played for Indios de San Francisco de Macor√≠s, and in 2014 he played for Club Jos√© Horacio Rodr√≠guez in the ASOBAE. He then played for Sameji in the Baloncesto Superior de Santiago; in 2016, he participated in the 2016 FIBA Americas League with Metros de Santiago. He ended his career in 2017 with Metros de Santiago. == National team career == Filion debuted with the Dominican national team at youth level, and was one of the best players of his team during the 2001 FIBA Under-21 World Championship in Saitama, Japan: he averaged 15.1 points, 3 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game. The Dominican Republic Under-21 team ended the tournament in 4th place. He then made his debut with the senior national team in 2003 and played during the 2003 Centrobasket, averaging 7 points and 3.7 rebounds per game, winning the silver medal. Filion was then called up with the national team for the 2003 Pan American Games in early August; during the competition he averaged 12.1 points, 4 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game, and the Dominican Republic won the silver medal. Later that month, Filion participated with his team in the 2003 Tournament of the Americas, where he had an 18-point, 6-rebound performance against the United States, and a 15-point performance against Puerto Rico. Filion took part in the 2004 Centrobasket averaging 12.6 points, 6 rebounds and 2.6 assists; he won the gold medal in the tournament. In 2005 he was part of the Dominican squad at the 2005 FIBA Americas Championship, where he found limited playing time and averaged 3.9 points and 1.9 rebounds per game. He then appeared in the 2006 Centrobasket, posting averages of 5.6 points and 2.2 rebounds. In 2010 he again appeared during the Centrobasket. In 2014 he was called up for the Central American and Caribbean Games, where he averaged 1 point and 0.5 rebounds per game. == References == ==External links== *Career stats at ProBallers.com *Stats at FIBA.basketball *Baloncesto Superior Nacional stats at BSNPR.com *Domincan league stats at Sportstg.com *French league stats Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Baloncesto Superior Nacional players Category:Basketball players at the 2003 Pan American Games Category:Centers (basketball) Category:Dominican Republic expatriate basketball people in France Category:Dominican Republic expatriate basketball people in Puerto Rico Category:Dominican Republic expatriate basketball people in the United States Category:Dominican Republic expatriate basketball people in Uruguay Category:Dominican Republic expatriate basketball people in Venezuela Category:Dominican Republic men's basketball players Category:Guaiquer√≠es de Margarita players Category:JA Vichy players Category:Pan American Games silver medalists for the Dominican Republic Category:Pan American Games medalists in basketball Category:Power forwards (basketball) ","title":"Amaury Filion"},{"id":"63904645","text":"is a Japanese former Nippon Professional Baseball pitcher. == References == Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Baseball people from Chiba Prefecture Category:Japanese baseball players Category:Nippon Professional Baseball pitchers category:Nippon Ham Fighters players category:Yokohama Taiy≈ç Whales players Category:Yokohama BayStars players category:Yakult Swallows players category:Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes players Category:Managers of baseball teams in Japan ","title":"Naoya Shimada"},{"id":"63904655","text":"The 1989‚Äì90 Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball team represented Kansas State University as a member of the Big 8 Conference during the 1989‚Äì90 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

These were the Enigma machine, the teleprinter cipher attachment (Lorenz cipher), and the cipher teleprinter the Siemens and Halske T52, (Siemens T-43). All were considered insecure. ==Introduction== ===Machine ciphers=== The first cipher attachment, the () SZ-40 original mode was introduced into the Army, probably in 1940,I-32 p.14 although Erich H√ºttenhain, a cryptographer assigned to the Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht (OKW/Chi), stated that the Army had been experimenting with this type of cryptographic apparatus from as early as 1937. It was replaced by the SZ-40 regular mode and this was succeeded by the SZ-42a and SZ-42b, both developed by Werner Liebknecht, Erich H√ºttenhain and Fritz Menzer.. The SZ-42c was also developed and 30 or 40 test sets built but the apparatus was evidently not used. The (), the first cipher teleprinter, T-52a, was introduced in 1939. Newer models were versions T-52c, T-52d and T-52e were in use. The one-time tape cipher teleprinter designated the SFM T-43 was developed in 1943 and introduced in 1944. The machine was theoretically unbreakable, if the key tape was truly random. However, the key tape was pseudo random as it was generated by the T-52e, and therefore insecure. ===Hand Ciphers=== The German Army used hand ciphers below division level. The manually operated hand systems of the Army that were used between 1939 and 1942 were listed by Erich H√ºttenhain as follows: * A monoalphabetic type substitution using a keyword mixed alphabet in a 5 x 5 square * A comb- transposition () * A book key () * A double Transposition cipher () 4-S-40 This system was used until 1926 or 1927 * The Playfair cipher in Single Playfair () (TS-42) * The Double Playfair () Message Cypher 42 (NS-42) In 1942, Walter Fricke of the General der Nachrichtenaufkl√§rung, declared that all hand systems currently in use by the army were insecure. Since the Field Army had no reserve hand systems, OKH/Chi was ordered to cooperate with the Army Signal Security agency department (In 7/IV) responsible for producing new systems. The following hand systems were evolved and used by the German Army from 1932-1945: * Three letter field codes () with or without enciphering table (). * Single transposition using grille () usually called Raster. * Double transposition () Under field conditions many makeshift systems were employed such as monoalphabetic substitution, transposition consisting only of reversing the order of the letters of the plaintext and whatever the particular radio operators might adopt by agreement among themselves. ===Weather ciphers=== For weather reporting, the army used two types of systems until 1945: * The Barbara Code () consisting of figure cards for encoding artillery meteorological reports, e.g. weather constants like wind velocity at various heights, 100m, 200m, for Army and anti-aircraft units. Walter Fricke considered this code, a terrible system. It employed an additive with as many as 100 messages in depth. General Erich Fellgiebel ordered it into use in 1939. OKW/Chi only became aware of its existence in 1944. The German Army considered the messages unimportant, even if broken, but after examining the code in detail, Fricke found that it was extremely valuable to the Allies, as it could be used by enemy bombers to perfectly calculate the trajectory of their bombs. The SG-41 was planned to replace this code. * Weather substitution tables, for enciphering meteorological reports in the Reich Weather Service. Walter Fricke also considered this a poor code. The Barbara Code was replaced in 1945 by the Rasterschl√ºssel 44 that was developed by Walter Fricke ==Preparation and distribution of cryptographic keys== The history of the preparation, printing and distribution of cryptographic keys by the German Army was described by Walter Fricke and Erich H√ºttenhain. According to Fricke, the keys for the Army were produced at the beginning of the war on In 7/IV's own press. The number of personnel required was small, about 20 people in all, since only enigma, weather and book staple keys () were printed. The number of personnel required for producing keys increased in 1940, when the Heftschl√ºssel was replaced by the double transposition and in 1942 when the double transposition was replaced by the TS-42a and the NS-42. A considerable increase in the personnel took place in the section as a result of the introduction of the key tables to the W/T tables. With the introduction of the SZ 40 and SZ 42 and other cryptographic systems which required keys, the amount of work entailed in the preparation of keys became too great for In 7/IV alone. In 1942, therefore, the production of key table manuscripts was transferred to the IBM section of the unit, and the printing to the Reich press in Berlin. In 7/VI was confined to reading proof and distributing the finished product. At the time of the bombing attacks on Berlin on 22 and 23 November 1943, the printing press and all key material of In 7/IV at the Tirpitzufer 76 was destroyed. The key producing section was then moved from Berlin into emergency quarters prepared some weeks before in the Army Signal Academy located in Halle () During this period, private printing firms were increasingly drawn on for the production of keys, first, because the Reich printing press could not meet the requirements, and secondly, decentralisation was becoming increasingly necessary to avoid bombing. About 20 firms in the central German area were given contracts. The high number was attributed to the introduction in 1944 of the Stencil System 44, the Rasterschl√ºssel 44. In May 1944, the key production section was transferred to the Hindenburg barracks at Dresden owing to a lack of space. This situation remained until 1 November 1944, when all the tasks of producing, printing and distributing of keys were transferred to Section IIIa of the OKW/Chi. This section was established in Dresden in the HQ in which the key preparation section of In 7/IV had occupied. In March 1945, Section IIIa was transferred from Dresden to the Army Signal Academy located in Halle due to the approach of the Soviet Army. Work was never begun, and on 12 April, keys and material production machines were loaded onto three trucks to be sent to southern Germany by goods train. Keys left in Halle were destroyed by Germany at the approach of the United States Army. ==German Army security studies== Before 1939, the Army High Command had no security organisation of its own. Questions of security concerning Army systems were transferred to the Codes and Ciphers section of the German Defense Ministry. Erich H√ºttenhain stated that he and Fritz Menzer conducted a security study on the initial model of the SZ40 and found that it could be solved in two days. This led to its improved form. In 1939, the Army High Command established its own Signal Security Agency (In 7/IV) which functioned as a unit until 1942. During the period of its operation, In 7/IV' examined the plugboard Enigma and made security studies on two other cryptographic machines proposed for Army usage, the M-40, first proposed by Fritz Menzer and the SG-41. The initiation of the security study of the plugboard Enigma was occasioned by Der Fall Wicher or case Wicher, the suspicion that Polish cryptanalysts of the Biuro Szyfr√≥w had already read Enigma machine traffic by 1939. It was known that several cryptanalysts including Friedrich B√∂hm made security studies of the machine, and found it to be secure, although it was insecure. The Army continued to use the system, until Walter Fricke informed the Army that the Armies manner of using the Indicators led to an easy solution. At his recommendation, the indicator system was changed. The two machines proposed for Army use, the M-40 and SG-41 were invented by Fritz Menzer, who worked for OKW/Chi. Security studies on the M-40 were conducted by Wachtmeister Heinrich D√∂ring and Otto Buggisch. Buggisch stated that the studies proved the device to be moderately secure, but that it was never used because it was as bulky as the plugboard Enigma but could not print letters. With regard to the SG-41, the studies made by OKH/Chi showed it to be superior to the M-40, but regarding its use, Buggisch stated: :The Army hemmed and hawed and never did adopt it In 1942, the security testing unit and most of the testing personnel of In 7/IV were transferred from their former unit to the Group IV of OKH/Chi Hans Pietsch, S Steinberg, Herbert von Denffer, Hilburg and Hans-Peter Luzius were named as those transferred. Security work was the responsibility of Group IV, Referat I, Section Ib, Subsections 7 and 13. Subsection 7 worked on testing German hand systems, 13 on machine systems. The first studies of Subsection 7 on German hand systems proved that all systems currently in use by the Army were solvable. As a result, OKH/Chi was ordered to collaborate with OKW/Chi in the development of new systems for the Army.Although OKH/Chi would have preferred to establish this section within itself, where the preparation of systems would be done in close cooperation with cryptanalytic specialists, this point of view was not recognised by the Army and OKH/Chi was ordered to send mathematicians back to In 7/IV. The mathematicians sent were Fricke, Jesse and Kehren. From that time on, subsection 7 only developed hand ciphers handed to it by the Field Army. Mettig noted that the amateur systems with which the section dealt were very bad and betokened great ignorance on the part of the Field Army in regard to code and cipher security. === Cipher teleprinter === Subsection 13, the section of Referat I of the General der Nachrichtenaufkl√§rung was responsible for the security of German Army cryptographic machine systems. They conducted security studies of the T-52 Schl√ºsselfernschreibmaschine, teleprinter. Versions SFM T-52A, B, and C were built by Werner Liebknecht and tested by Heinrich D√∂ring in the summer of 1942 and were discovered to be easily solvable. By the autumn of 1942, despite the alterations of the individual encipherment, it was clear to the mathematicians that Version C could not be made secure. In was considered exceedingly awkward, as it was the latest available secret teleprinter and was used in communication from Germany to neutral countries. This improvement, the SFM T-52d, was ready in early 1943 and was shown by Heinrich D√∂ring to be probably insecure. Owing to the fact that there was shortage of spare parts and industry could not deliver the new machines sufficiently speedy, the High Command, largely out of wishful thinking, began to consider the misgivings of OKH/Chi as unwarranted. Despite warnings from the unit, the Field Army continued to use SFM T-52c. They were particularly sure of it because they thought the land lines that the system ran on, i.e. where the messages passed through, could not be tapped by the Allies. Not until a cellar equipped to tap land lines was found in Paris in late 1942, did the Army consent to the improvement of the machine. Further evidence of lines being tapped came from the military attache in Stockholm, who later did a very foolish thing when he asked Oslo to send him T-52 keys in the clear. Early in 1943, Heinrich D√∂ring established by further investigations that T-52d was not secure and that single messages could be solved. He did it as follows: Each letter was characterised by five electrical impulses (positive or negative). On the basis of these impulses, D√∂ring differentiated between letters having positive and negative qualities. An enciphered positive letter preserved its positive quality. Having established the plus/minus relationship of the text, it was possible to feed a suspected clear word through the message until it fitted correctly. Thence the message could be broken. As a result, a new alteration was made in the T-52d from which the T-52e emerged, which was regarded until the end of the war as secure. === Enigma === Some security research was conducted on the plugboard Enigma by subsection 13, although no definite conclusion was reached concerning its security. In 1943‚Äì44, case Wicher was confirmed when definite proof was obtained from the two Polish officers, who were being held prisoner at Neuengamme concentration camp, close to Hamburg. They confirmed the poles had read the plugboard Enigma both before the Polish Campaign and after. This proof collaborated the suspicions around in 1940. Heinrich D√∂ring and Hans Pietsch, were sent to interrogate the Polish prisoners, and had drawn a blank, it became evident that the Polish at Wicher had solved Enigma traffic, and moved to France. OKH/Chi never realised that the Polish cipher bureau had been researching the Enigma, in one form or another, from about 1920. The mathematicians of subsection 13 believed that solution had ceased when the Field Army followed Walter Fricke's indicator recommendations. The general result was that subsection 13 did not press the matter of Enigma security. === Cipher Device 39 === Subsection 13 had also assisted in the design of the Cipher Device 39 Schl√ºsselger√§t 39, an improved Enigma which was intended to employ a plugboard, changeable turnover rotors, pluggable reflecting wheels, and additional Hagelin-type drive wheels. This machine was in all likelihood secure and unbreakable. Otto Buggisch stated that these machines were his speciality. They were constructed at the Technische und Normalzeit firm in Frankfurt at the time of the surrender. The responsibility for the security of German Army cryptographic systems remained with subsections 7 and 13 until 1934, when it was turned over to OKW/Chi. The Army then retained only the responsibility for seeing the systems, approved by OKW/Chi, were properly used.D-68 pp.3-4 ==Attitude to security studies== Whenever the German Army was asked to change a system, there was always a storm of protest. It was not them but the staff of General Fellgiebel (Chef HNV) () (HNV) which made the decision on which methods to be used. The results depended on whether the officers at HNV at the time, happened to know anything about cryptography. He usually did not, as it was a specialised field. In 1942, all hand systems were solvable. When the HNV was told this, the reply was that Germany had won all her battles so far, using these systems, and there was no need to overload the troops with new methods. Only with the greatest difficulty was the Field Army persuaded to change its methods. One of the specific ways in which the Field Army consciously hampered progress in security studies was to refuse to furnish OKH/Chi actual traffic. Fricke stated that OKH/Chi never knew how the Field Army actually used the systems which it approved. When OKH/Chi asked for studies, it was given specially prepared messages such as We are standing in Berlin and See the Polish infantry coming down the Frankfurt Allee. However, the Field Army made a brief attempt in 1941 to provide the unit analysts with actual traffic. For this purpose a Signal Intelligence Regiment of the Replacement Army () was formed. While two companies of this unit were to act as administrative units for personnel of In 7/VI, the department of the Army Signal Security agency responsible for cryptanalysis of non-Russian traffic, the third company was an intercept unit in the field collecting material for the analysts. Owing to personnel shortage, this unit was dissolved in February 1942, and no subsequent attempt was made by the German Field Army to procure actual traffic for OKH/Chi. As described above, it was difficult to persuade the Field Army to accept as valid the security studies made by the analysts of In 7/VI. Not until a cellar that contained equipment for tapping land lines used by the T-52c teleprinter, was raided in Paris in early 1943, was the Army High Command persuaded that the security studies made by the OKH/Chi had been valid. The attitude of the Field Army could be traced largely to the ignorance on all levels of matters pertaining to codes and cipher security. Traffic handed to In 7/VI for scrutiny betrayed the lamentable ignorance of the Field Army. Signal tables set up by the troops revealed serious cryptographic errors such as the failure to change keywords for long periods. In an attempt to correct this ignorance, OKH/Chi gave lectures at the Army Signal Academy located in Halle () and issued instructions on code and cipher security. The situation, however, was never satisfactory resolved. Buggisch stated, while researching the C-36 device that the studies made on the device by B. et all were used by Oberinspector K√ºhn and Major Mang to forestall the introduction of the device into the German Army, as advocated by Major Mang. Buggisch stated later, :it was tragic-comic:When OKH/Chi detected an insecurity, it was not able to achieve effective remedies; if In 7/VI wanted to install new devices, it had even more difficulties. The Army \\"hemmed and hawed\\" and never got around to acting. ==Summary== German signal intelligence did not take a creative, non-linear view of attacking Enigma security, or any other secure system. When reporting on the security of Enigma or even of other ciphers including enemy systems, then focused on the statistics of cryptology. Their security investigations and cryptanalytic reports examined either the problems of physical compromise or of possible statistical methods for breaking systems. Among the surviving wartime documents, no reports deal with the more subtle ways around and into cryptologic problems. The Army had cryptanalysts attack their own Enigmas, and in these attacks Germany's experts seem to have stuck to statistical and straightforward approaches. They conducted statistical attacks on Enigma-enciphered traffic both with and without the help of captured documentation. Both the OKH/Chi and Pers Z S found methods to solve the original unsteckered versions of Enigma. However, it was known they never tackled live traffic, for reasons described above, and instead stuck to straightforward attacks conducted under artificial conditions. All these examinations concluded that the Enigma would defeat enemy cryptanalysts. Throughout these investigations, German cryptologists seem to have never realised the true reduction of Enigma's probability space under real conditions, particularly those reductions arising from operational procedures and human error. German cryptanalysts had no luck solving Allied high-grade ciphers and this lack of success only reinforced their believe in Enigma strength and vice versa. As Enigma had proved unbreakable, the Typex would proved even more impervious to attack, and hence the Army did not expend much effort on attacking the device. Relying too heavily on theoretical statistics made Germany vulnerable. They knew that Great Britain had captured Enigma machines and associated documentation by the middle of the war. They also knew that Britain had a history of successful cryptanalysis and appreciated the abilities of British intelligence, yet they relied on a statistical security that took neither operational reality into account nor their opponent's capability. They ignored simple factors which could have hindered, if not defeated the Allies. One example, was the complete replacement of the rotors, by the Army, which was never done for various reasons. Germany did recognise many of these procedural problems and they frequently reprimanded Enigma operators for insecure habits. In additions, several agencies, conducted investigations into Enigma that hinted at the system's general compromise. However, only the examination of live traffic under real conditions could have suggested the true level of security for Enigma, or indeed any other system, and this was never done. ==References== Category:History of cryptography Category:Military history of Germany during World War II Category:Signals intelligence of World War II ","title":"German Army cryptographic systems of World War II"},{"id":"63904810","text":"Kiliwa may refer to: * Kiliwa people, an ethnic group of Mexico * Kiliwa language, their language ","title":"Kiliwa"},{"id":"63904812","text":"is a Japanese former Nippon Professional Baseball pitcher. == References == Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:Baseball people from Aichi Prefecture Category:Asia University (Japan) alumni Category:Japanese baseball players Category:Nippon Professional Baseball pitchers category:Kintetsu Buffaloes players Category:Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes players category:Chunichi Dragons players Category:Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles players ","title":"Hideo Koike"},{"id":"63904838","text":"The following is the list of the Mayors of Wroc≈Çaw, Poland; heads of local municipal government () according to extant records.

According to a Chinese newspaper, as of 2019 cooperation documents have been signed with or projects undertaken in 138 countries and 30 international organisations. The BRI, which launched in September 2013, is Xi Jinping's \\"grand political-economic project\\". It affects three-quarters of the known energy reserves in the world. ==Africa== As of April 2020, China's official Belt and Road website lists 42 African countries who have signed onto an agreement or understanding with the One Belt One Road initiative. Africa is considered a key part of China's One Belt One Road efforts, due to its potential for rails, roads, and energy. Many African countries are also in need of better infrastructure, which is still seen as a major barrier to development in the region. In 2018, only 40 percent of Africans had access to electricity, 33 percent had access to paved roads, and 5 percent of agricultural land was irrigated. China began many of its investment activities in the East Africa region, given its access to ports and need for rails and roads, but initiatives have since branched out to numerous projects across the continent. Major road infrastructure projects stretch to south and north Africa, such as Mozambique's Maputo‚ÄìKatembe bridge and Algeria's Cherchell Ring Expressway Project. Belt and Road projects in Africa focus generally on transport and power but include variation within, from international rail and expressways, seaports, hydropower to carbon-based power, water supply and sanitation, and many other programs. Subsequently, China's investments in the region have also risen significantly since the beginning of 2000, with total spending from the Chinese government and companies reaching US$6 billion in 2014. China is now the largest funder of infrastructure projects in Africa, financially backing around a fifth of all projects and constructing a third of them. A McKinsey & Company report estimates that more than 10,000 Chinese- owned firms operate in Africa, with about 90 percent privately owned. Numerous studies have shown that Chinese investment has had a positive effect on Africa, though growing debt has led to some states slightly pulling back on their plans. According to the Johns Hopkins China Africa Research Initiative, East African countries alone have borrowed more than $29 billion from China for various projects. Some countries like Djibouti, Kenya, and Uganda have issued warnings over the ballooning debt, following the case of the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port transfer in Sri Lanka. To build many of the construction projects, China has sent a large number of Chinese workers to developing countries. However, this has become a point of controversy especially in Africa, as high unemployment rates continue to hurt the large young population. Aside from economic activities, China has also shaped the Belt and Road as an opportunity to build cultural ties between Africa and China. ===Djibouti=== Djibouti, a remote country at the Horn of Africa, is at the heart of China's multibillion-dollar \\"Belt and Road Initiative\\", supporting Beijing's juggling of commercial and military objectives amid Western suspicions about its motives. Djibouti's Doraleh Multi-purpose Port, the Hassan Gouled Aptidon International Airport, and Ahmed Dini Admed International Airpot in Obock were built with about US$596 million in support from China. In total, the Export-Import Bank of China has lent approximately US$1 billion to Djibouti, funding nearly 40 percent of Djibouti's substantial infrastructure and investment projects. Due to the Belt and Road initiative, Ethiopia and Djibouti are now bridged through the Addis Ababa‚ÄìDjibouti Railway and Ethiopia-Djibouti Water Pipeline. China's economic relations with Djibouti have extended to increased military involvement in the Horn of Africa region. Among the numerous Djibouti infrastructure projects, China built a military base and has deployed ships from its South Sea Fleet. Djibouti's base is a sign of China's growing naval presence across the globe. Meanwhile, China has argued that its anti-piracy missions from the Djibouti base has increased its capacity to support One Belt One Road projects. ===Egypt=== Egypt has traditionally had a very strong relationship with China, so when China first announced its Belt and Road Initiative, Egypt was one of the first countries to sign onto the agreement. Following the instability from the 2011 Arab Spring protests, China was one of few countries willing to provide loans and financial support to Egypt. Since, China has introduced a number of projects including a Chinese industrial zone in the Gulf of Suez, an electric train system for its new capital, and investments in the Western Sahara. Egypt's New Administrative Capital is also a landmark for the Belt and Road Initiative. From 2015 to 2017, Egypt borrowed US$1.03 billion from China to finance various infrastructure projects. The same time period brought in around 1,900 workers from China to work on construction. The scale of China's projects and consistent Belt and Road activity has also strengthened diplomatic ties between Egypt and China. President Xi Jinping and President Abdel Fatah al- Sisi have praised one another repeatedly for their efforts in the One Belt One Road initiative, and emphasized their shared history of ancient civilizations and infrastructure. Egypt is seen as a vital part of China's One Belt One Road initiative, due to its geographical position and close diplomatic relationship. In 2018, a Chinese consortium that included Shanghai Electric and Dongfang Electric won a tender for a 6,000 megawatt coal-fired electricity-generating plant in Hamrawein, on the Red Sea, with a bid of $4.4 billion. In February 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Egypt postponed indefinitely China-funded construction of the power plant at Hamrawein. ===Ethiopia=== Ethiopia's Eastern Industrial Zone is a manufacturing hub outside Addis Ababa that was built by China and occupied by factories of Chinese manufacturers. According to Chinese media and the vice director of the industrial zone, there were 83 companies resident within the zone, of which 56 had started production. However, a study in Geoforum noted that the EIZ has yet to serve as a catalyst for Ethiopia's overall economic development due to many factors including poor infrastructure outside the zone. Discrepancies between the two countries' industries also mean that Ethiopia cannot benefit from direct technological transfer and innovation. From October 2011 to February 2012, Chinese companies were contracted to supersede the century-old Ethio-Djibouti Railways by constructing a new electric standard gauge Addis Ababa‚ÄìDjibouti Railway. The new railway line, stretching more than and travelling at , shortens the journey time between Addis Ababa and Dijbouti from three days to about 12 hours. The first freight service began in November 2015 and passenger service followed in October 2016. On China‚ÄìEthiopia cooperation on international affairs, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that China and Ethiopia are both developing countries, and both countries are faced with a complicated international environment. He stated that the partnership will be a model at the forefront of developing China‚ÄìAfrica relations. ===Kenya=== In May 2014, Premier Li Keqiang signed a cooperation agreement with the Kenyan government to build the Mombasa‚ÄìNairobi Standard Gauge Railway connecting Mombasa to Nairobi. The railway cost US$3.2bn and was Kenya's biggest infrastructure project since independence. The railway was claimed to cut the journey time from Mombasa to Nairobi from 9 hours by bus or 12 hours on the previous railway to 4.5 hours. In May 2017, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta called the 470 km railway a new chapter that \\"would begin to reshape the story of Kenya for the next 100 years\\". The project is seen as President Kenyatta's legacy project According to Kenya Railways Corporation, the railway carried 1.3 million Kenyans with a 96.7% seat occupancy and 600,000 tons of cargo in its first year of operation. Chinese media claim that the railway line boosted the country's GDP by 1.5% and created 46,000 jobs for locals and trained 1,600 railway professionals. However, in 2019, China suddenly stopped funding of its railway, about 75 miles short of Nairobi. Cease in funding came rather surprisingly, but may be attributed to rising concerns globally that \\"Belt and Road was loading poorer nations with unsustainable debt. Xi signaled in April that Beijing would exert more control over projects and tighten oversight.\\" === Nigeria === On 12 January 2019, Nigeria's first standard gauge railway, which has been successfully operated for 900 days, had no major accidents since its inception. With the successful completion of the railway construction by China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC), the Abuja Kaduna train service began commercial operation on 27 July 2016. The Abuja-Kaduna railway line is one of the first standard gauge railroad railway modernization projects (SGRMP) in Nigeria. This is the first part of the Lagos-Kano standard metrics project, which will connect the business centres of Nigeria with the economic activity centres of the northwestern part of the country. In a resolution of the Johannesburg Summit of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum in 2015, the Chinese government promised to provide satellite television to 10,000 African villages. It is reported that each of the 1,000 selected villages in Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, will receive two sets of solar projection television systems and a set of solar 32-inch digital TV integrated terminal systems. A total of 20,000 Nigerian rural families will benefit from the project. Kpaduma, an underdeveloped rural community on the edge of the Nigerian capital of Abuja, is familiar with analog TV and has no chance to see the satellite TV channels enjoyed by people in Nigerian towns. The implementation of the project will create more jobs, 1,000 Nigerians in selected villages have received training on how to install, recharge and operate satellite TV systems. ===Sudan=== In Sudan, China has helped the country establish its oil industry and provided agricultural assistance for the cotton industry. Future plans include developing railways, roads, ports, a nuclear power station, solar power farms and more dams for irrigation and electricity generation. ===Uganda=== In Uganda, Chinese companies have financed two major hydroelectricity projects, the Karuma Hydropower Project and Isimba Hydroelectric Power Station. The Export-Import Bank of China granted loans that covered approximately 85% of funding for both projects, while the government of Uganda provided the remaining 15 percent. Uganda also borrowed $350 million to build the Entebbe‚ÄìKampala Expressway, the terms of which include 20 years with a 7 years grace period and 2% fixed interest rate. More recently in 2020, Uganda announced it would be borrowing another US$118 million for roads, part of an oil production project that Uganda has looked to kickoff for the past few years. Diplomatically, President Museveni has praised China for its willingness to fund projects with \\"no strings attached\\", allowing Museveni to take on a number of projects for the first time in his three-decade term. China's Ambassador Zheng Zhuqian also reaffirmed the relationship with Uganda, remarking that China \\"firmly supports the Ugandan exploration for a development path with Ugandan characteristics.\\" However, critics warn over Uganda's burgeoning debt, which was at $10 billion in 2018 and a third of which is owed to China. ==Europe== Freight train services between China and Europe were initiated in March 2011. The service's first freight route linked China to Tehran. The China‚ÄìBritain route was launched in January 2017. , the network had expanded to cover 48 Chinese cities and 42 European destinations, delivering goods between China and Europe. The 10,000th trip was completed on 26 August 2018 with the arrival of freight train X8044 in Wuhan, China from Hamburg, Germany. The network was further extended southward to Vietnam in March 2018. === Poland === Poland's President Andrzej Duda and Xi Jinping wave to the crowd during the inauguration of the China Railway Express in Warsaw, 20 June 2016 Poland was one of the first European countries to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with China about the BRI in 2015. Poland's President Duda said that he hopes Poland will become a gateway to Europe for China. ===Greece=== The foreign ministers of China and Greece signed a memorandum of understanding related to further cooperation under the Belt and Road initiative on 29 August 2018. COSCO revitalized and currently runs the Port of Piraeus. Both China and Greece see each other as natural allies in developing the Belt & Road\\", Chinese leader Xi Jinping said at the start of a state visit aimed at deepening cooperation with Greece across the board, adding his desire to \\"keep the momentum going\\" and \\"reinforce\\" bilateral relations === Portugal === During president Xi's visit to Lisbon in December 2018, the Southern European nation signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China. ===Italy=== In March 2019, Italy became the first G7 Nation to join China's Belt and Road Initiative. === Austria === During a visit of Chancellor Kurz to China in April 2019, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed on Austria's cooperation in the BRI project. According to Kurz, Austria \\"support[s] the One Belt One Road initiative and [is] trying to forge a close economic cooperation [with China]. Austria has know-how and expertise to offer in many areas where China is looking for the same\\". ===Luxembourg=== On 27 March 2019, Luxembourg signed an agreement with China to cooperate on Belt and Road Initiative. ===Switzerland=== On 29 April 2019, during his visit to Beijing, Swiss President Ueli Maurer signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China under the Belt and Road Initiative. ==Caucasus== ===Armenia=== On 4 April 2019, the President of Armenia Armen Sarkissian received a delegation led by Shen Yueyue, Vice-Chairwoman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee of China in Yerevan, Armenia. President Sarkissian stated that Armenia and China are ancient countries with centuries-old tradition of cooperation since the existence of the Silk Road. The President noted the development of cooperation in the 21st century in the sidelines of the One Belt One Road program initiated by the top leadership of China and stated that \\"It‚Äôs time for Armenia to become part of the new Silk Road\\". ===Azerbaijan=== On 25‚Äì27 April 2019, the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation was held in Beijing, China. A delegation led by President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev attended the Forum. The event brought together heads of governments from 37 countries, including Azerbaijan, Russia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Austria, Belarus, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Serbia, Singapore, the UAE, and others, as well as heads of international organizations. In his speech, the President Ilham Aliyev stated that, \\"From the very beginning Azerbaijan supported the Belt and Road initiative put forward by Chinese leader Xi Jinping. This initiative not only provides transportation of productivity, it strengthens ties between different countries, serve the course of dialogue and cooperation, creates new opportunities for international trade.\\" The creation of modern infrastructure is one of the priorities for Azerbaijan and will foster the flow of international trade by building bridges between Europe and Asia. Among these notable infrastructure projects are Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway and the Baku International Sea Trade Port (the Port of Baku) that play an important role in transportation in Eurasia. Currently, the Port of Baku has the capacity to handle 15 million tons of cargo, including 100000 TEU, which will grow to 25 million tons of cargo and 500000 TEU in the future. By investing in modern transportation and logistics infrastructure Azerbaijan not only transforms itself into an important transportation hub but also contributes to the cooperation with countries involved in east‚Äìwest and North-South Corridors. ===Georgia=== On 25 April 2019, the Minister of Infrastructure and Regional Development of Georgia Maya Tskitishvili stated that, \\"One Belt-One Road initiative is important for Georgia and the country is actively involved in its development.\\" She also noted that Georgia was among the first countries who signed the memorandum for developing the 'One Belt-One Road' initiative in March 2015. ==Russia and the Eurasian Economic Union== Participants of the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing in 2017 Urban map of Central Asia On 26 April 2019, the leaders of Russia and China called their countries \\"good friends\\" and vowed to work together in pursuing greater economic integration of Eurasia. On the sidelines of the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing, China's paramount leader Xi Jinping and Russian president Vladimir Putin pledged to further strengthen economic and trade cooperation between the two sides. Vladimir Putin further stated that, \\"countries gathering under the Belt and Road Initiative and the Eurasian Economic Union share long-term strategic interests of peace and growth\\". In June 2019, Xi and Putin stated they were committed to the concept of building the \\"Great Eurasian Partnership\\". That took the form of Xi stating that he had agreed with Putin to link the Eurasian Economic Union with China's Belt & Road Initiative. The China‚ÄìBelarus Industrial Park is a special economic zone established in Smolevichy, Minsk in 2013. According to the park's chief administrator, 36 international companies have settled in the park as of August 2018. Chinese media said the park will create 6,000 jobs and become a real city with 10,000 residents by 2020. ==Asia== === Central Asia === The five countries of Central Asia ‚Äì Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan ‚Äì are an important part of the land route of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Vakulchuk, Roman and Indra Overland (2019) \\"China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative through the Lens of Central Asia\\", in Fanny M. Cheung and Ying-yi Hong (eds) Regional Connection under the Belt and Road Initiative. The Prospects for Economic and Financial Cooperation. London: Routledge, pp. 115‚Äì133. The Central Asia Data-Gathering and Analysis Team has identified 261 BRI projects within Central Asian nations with a minimum investment totaling more than US$136 million. As of April 2019, Kazakhstan invested about $30 billion on infrastructure development, transport and logistics assets and competence as part of the Belt and Road Initiative. Due to Kazakhstan's infrastructure modernization, The Western Europe ‚Äì Western China intercontinental highway now connects Europe and China through Russia and Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan stands to receive a potential $5 billion annually in transit fees from goods moving through it to other markets. In Kyrgyzstan, 2011‚Äì2017 BRI projects total committed funds is equal to US$4.1 billion. Employment created from established companies is not significant, making up only 0.1‚Äì0.3% of total employment in the country, just several thousand jobs. The weight of debt repayment for BRI projects will not be felt until the 2020s, because of the grace periods on most loans ranging from 5‚Äì11 years. Kyrgyzstan has the potential to benefit greatly from BRI; If tax legislation is handled well, particularly in manufacturing and transit projects, then revenue will be high. ‚ÄúFrom the perspective of Uzbekistan, the BRI could help open the corridor to the Persian Gulf, enabling expansion of commercial and trade routes for the country.\\" Exporting Uzbek goods to more regions is a highly attractive incentive for Uzbekistan. At the First Belt and Road Forum held in Beijing May 2017 both presidents, Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan and Xi Jinping of China, spoke positively of future collaboration in BRI advancement. During those meetings, the \\"two countries signed 115 deals worth more $23 billion on enhancing their cooperation in electrical power, oil production, chemicals, architecture, textiles, pharmaceutical engineering, transportation, infrastructure and agriculture.\\" In 2019 Uzbekistan established a new government group in charge of aligning their own country's development plan with China's BRI ambitions. China is Uzbekistan's largest trade partner (both in imports and exports) and has more than 1500 Chinese businesses within its territory. In 2018, \\"China-Uzbekistan trade surged 48.4 percent year-on-year, reaching 6.26 billion U.S. dollars.\\" ‚ÄúBRI projects in Tajikistan range from roads and railways to pipelines and power plants, even including traffic cameras.\\" In 2018, \\"Tajikistan paid a Chinese company building a power plant with a gold mine; a few years earlier it swapped Beijing some land for debt.\\" Turkmenistan in most regards has been closed off to the world. However, Turkmenistan, because of a desire to see infrastructure and energy projects move ahead, is increasingly opening itself to the world. Turkmenistan doesn't have the capabilities of seeing many of its projects come to fruition on its own. In June 2016, Gurbanguly, Turkmenistan's president, approached Xi Jinping to discuss his desire to become more involved in BRI and seeing previously planned projects completed and or expanded. These projects include the Turkmenistan's and China gas pipeline (with four lines, the fourth forthcoming), The International North-South transportation corridor (which provides railway connections between Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Iran, with another line connecting China to Iran via Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan), The Lapis Lazuli international transit corridor (rail connecting Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey), and the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan- Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline project. ===Hong Kong=== During his 2016 policy address, Hong Kong chief executive Leung Chun- ying's announced his intention of setting up a Maritime Authority aimed at strengthening Hong Kong's maritime logistics in line with Beijing's economic policy. Leung mentioned \\"One Belt, One Road\\" no fewer than 48 times during the policy address, but details were scant. ===Indonesia=== In 2016, China Railway International won a bid to build Indonesia's first high-speed rail, the Jakarta‚ÄìBandung High Speed Rail. It will shorten the journey time between Jakarta and Bandung from over three hours to forty minutes The project, initially scheduled for completion in 2019, was delayed by land clearance issues. 2000 locals are working on the project. ===Laos=== In Laos, construction of the Vientiane‚ÄìBoten Railway began on 25 December 2016 and is scheduled to be completed in 2021. It is China's first overseas railway project that will connect to China's railway network. Once operational, the Laos‚ÄìChina Railway will be Laos' longest and connect with Thailand to become part of the proposed Kunming‚ÄìSingapore railway, extending from the Chinese city of Kunming and running through Thailand and Laos to terminate at Singapore. It is estimated to cost US$5.95 billion with 70% of the railway owned by China, while Laos's remaining 30% stake will be mostly financed by loans from China. However, it faces opposition within Laos due to the high cost of the project. ===Maldives=== Maldives undertook a number of China funded projects under the Presidency of Abdullah Yameen (2013‚Äì18), including the China Maldives Friendship Bridge, The Velana International Airport and the artificial island of Hulhulmale. Many of these investments were made without adequate disclosures to the public on their cost and other terms. Under President Yameen, Maldives also amended its constitution to allow foreigners to own land in the archipelago ‚Äì following which the island of Feydhoo Finholu was taken up on a long-term lease by a Chinese company. ===Malaysia=== Under the Premiership of Najib Razak, Malaysia signed multiple investment deals with China, including a US$27 billion East Coast Rail Link project, pipeline projects worth more than $3.1 billion, as well as a $100 billion Forest City in Johor. During the 2018 Malaysian general election, then-opposition leader Mahathir Mohamad expressed disapproval of Chinese investment in Malaysia, comparing it to selling off the country to foreigners. Upon election as Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir labelled the China-funded projects as \\"unfair\\" deals authorized by former prime minister Najib Razak and would leave Malaysia \\"indebted\\" to China. As was argued by Kit Wei Zheng of Citibank, he believed that the projects were likely to have been driven more by China's geopolitical interests than by the profit motive, such that China would have access to the Straits of Malacca. In August 2018, at the end of an official visit to China, Mahathir cancelled the East Coast Rail Link project and two other pipeline projects that had been awarded to the China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau. These had been linked to corruption at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad, citing a need to reduce debt incurred by the previous government. In addition, Mahathir also threatened to deny foreign buyers a long-stay visa, prompting a clarification by Housing Minister Zuraida Kamaruddin and the Prime Minister's Office. The project undergo negotiations for several months and close to be cancelled off. After rounds of negotiation and diplomatic mission, the ECRL project is resumed after Malaysia and China agreed to continue the project with reduced cost of RM 44 billion (US$10.68 billion) from the original of RM 65.5 billion. ===Pakistan=== The China‚ÄìPakistan Economic Corridor is a major Belt and Road Initiative project encompassing investments in transport, energy and maritime infrastructure. As Belt and Road News reported Pakistan‚Äôs Orange Line Metro Train Project in the Country‚Äôs Eastern City of Lahore under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), was completed and delivered to Pakistan on October 11, 2020.https://www.beltandroad.news/2020/10/10/cpec- delivered-pakistans-orange-line-metro-train-project/ ===Sri Lanka=== China's main investment in Sri Lanka was the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port, mostly funded by the Chinese government and built by two Chinese companies. It claims to be the largest port in Sri Lanka after the Port of Colombo and the \\"biggest port constructed on land to date in the country\\". It was initially intended to be owned by the Government of Sri Lanka and operated by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, however it incurred heavy operational losses and the Sri Lankan government was unable to service the debt to China. In a debt restructuring plan on 9 December 2017, 70% of the port was leased and port operations were handed over to China for 99 years, The deal gave the Sri Lankan government $1.4 billion, that they will be using to pay off the debt to China. This led to accusations that China was practicing debt-trap diplomacy. The port's strategic location and subsequent ownership spurred concern over China's growing economic footprint in the Indian Ocean and speculation that it could be used as a naval base. The Sri Lankan government promised that it was intended \\"purely for civilian use\\". Colombo International Financial City built on land reclaimed from the Indian Ocean and funded with $1.4bn in Chinese investment is a special financial zone and another major Chinese investment in Sri Lanka. ===Thailand=== In Thailand in 2005, the Chinese pharmaceutical company, Holley Group, and the Thai industrial estate developer, Amata Group, signed an agreement to develop the Thai‚ÄìChinese Rayong Industrial Zone. Since 2012, Chinese companies have also opened solar, rubber, and industrial manufacturing plants in the zone, and the zone expects the number to increase to 500 by 2021. Chinese media have attributed this to Thailand's zero tax incentives on land use and export products as well as favorable labor costs, and claimed that the zone had created more than 3000 local jobs. In December 2017, China and Thailand began the construction of a high-speed railway that links the cities of Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima, which will be extended to Nong Khai to connect with Laos, as part of the planned Kunming‚ÄìSingapore railway. The first high-speed rail rail station in Thailand should be complete in 2021, with lines to enter service in 2024. Progress on the high-speed line has stuttered for several years with Thai authorities uneasy over the high- interest rates charged by Chinese financing, the track design and even the need for the scheme. In September 2020 the Thai cabinet released a fresh portion of US$380 million cash to purchase Chinese-made bullet trains and tracks. After years of stuttering progress on a 250 km high-speed rail link, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi signed a deal in Bangkok in October 2020.https://www.beltandroad.news/2020/10/14/railway-project-under-belt-road- expected-to-be-sign-by-wang-yi/ === Turkey === President Erdogan in his visit to China signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China under the Belt and Road Initiative and asked to increase trade volume, Referring to the fact that the volume of trade between the two countries reached $50 billion in the first phase, and in the second phase $100 billion in other goals. Thanks to the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway being integrated with Edirne-Kars high-speed train, projects with China will be able to transport their goods to Europe much sooner. == North and South America == Panama was the first to sign BRI agreements, followed by Bolivia, Antigua and Barbuda, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana. === Venezuela === Although not technically in the BRI, in 2001 Venezuela became the first country in South America to sign an agreement with China it termed \\"strategic development partnership\\". As of January 2019, the list totals 790 projects. Loans from China to Venezuela reached at least $50 billion by 2017, or one-third of the Chinese Development Bank investment in the continent. Along with the money came 500,000 Chinese citizens. Chinese geologists have mapped and prospected just under 1,000,000 square kilometres of Venezuelan land. The Chinese covet the Thorium deposits for their planned global constellation of nuclear reactors. === Argentina === The Argentine- China Joint Hydropower Project will build two dams on the Santa Cruz River in southern Argentina: Condor Cliff and La Barrancosa. The China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC) will be responsible for the project, which is expected to provide 5,000 direct and 15,000 indirect jobs in the country. It will generate 4,950 MWh of electricity, reducing the dependence on fossil fuels. === Jamaica === On 11 April 2019, Jamaica and China signed a memorandum of understanding for Jamaica to join the BRI. ==References== Category:One Belt, One Road Category:International economics lists ","title":"List of projects of the Belt and Road Initiative"},{"id":"63904874","text":"The 1989‚Äì90 Richmond Spiders men's basketball team represented the University of Richmond in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college basketball during the 1989‚Äì90 season.

He was the first president of Sortu, and a member of the Basque Parliament. == Early life == Arraiz was born on 13 June 1973 in Gasteiz. He went on to study romance studies at the University of the Basque Country. Having participated in youth groups against the military in Gasteiz, in 1997 he was sentenced to two years and four months in prison for military draft evasion. He was pardoned a year later. == Political career == === Early career === In his youth, Arraiz was a member of Jarrai, a youth organisation of the Abertzale left that has since been banned as a terrorist group. He was a candidate for Euskal Herritarrok in the constituency of √Ålava in the regional elections of the Basque Country in 1998 and in 2001. In 1998 he was a deputy candidate, and in 2001 was sixth on the party list. === Batasuna and EH Bildu === In January 2007, he was briefly detained after refusing to identify himself to police officers when a group of Jarrai supporters were arrested, but was released without charge shortly afterwards. Later that year, on 4 October 2007, he was detained again by the National Police Corps whilst participating in a meeting of the National Council of Batasuna in the town of Segura. He spent two and a half years in pre-trial custody. In 2012 he was a candidate in the regional elections for EH Bildu, in the same constituency as previously of √Ålava, whilst still technically released on bail from the October 2007 incident. He was elected on the EH Bildu ticket, and obtained his first political role. Relevant information is contained within the final electoral lists, which you can find in the archive file \\"ElecP12_c.xls\\". In 2015 Arraiz, acting as a spokesperson for EH Bildu, presented a bill to the Basque parliament laying the prerequisite legal foundations for a \\"consultation\\" on independence for the Basque Country. === Sortu === On 23 February 2013 the Constituent Assembly of Sortu chose Arraiz as the first president of the party at their founding conference; he was the only candidate presented. Following his election, he called for union among Basque nationalist parties, claiming it was necessary to leave the \\"tired autonomic framework\\" behind. He repeated this call in an interview with Radio Euskadi in July 2013. He later opened the door to other organisations, such as unions and social movements, to join what he called an \\"accumulation of democratic forces\\" to put into effect a process to realise \\"the rights of the Basque Country as a nation\\". During Arraiz's presidency of Sortu, the ongoing case against him for the October 2007 incident continued, with the prosecutor of the Basque Country asking in February 2015 for Arraiz to be sentenced to six years in prison. In 2015, Arraiz caused controversy by saying it was the time to \\"checkmate\\" the Civil Guard, the Spanish military police force, that \\"they should leave the Basque Country now\\", and that the \\"only violence is that of the Spanish state\\". In a press conference, Arraiz said that the Basque people were facing a \\"terrorist state\\" in the Spanish government. A case was subsequently opened against him investigating whether the statements he made could have constituted incitement of terrorism. A court found in June 2016 that his statements were not incitement of terrorism; the case was subsequently closed and archived. In February 2015, the public prosecutor declared that Arraiz was a member of the banned Basque separatist terrorist organisation ETA. The case against Arraiz was subsequently delayed until 2016. In May 2016 he was banned by a judge from holding public office for his relationship with Batasuna, but avoided a prison sentence, after admitting having been a member of the ETA and apologising to its victims during the trial. After leaving the Basque Parliament in May 2016, he left the leadership of Sortu during their process of \\"re-foundation\\" in July 2016, at which point the position of president was abolished. == Personal life == Arraiz is the father of two twin girls.

The decedent, aged 15‚Äì16 at the time of her death, had been physically abused and finally murdered before being dumped into the river, when she was found on July 31, 2001. == Case summary == On July 31, 2001, around 2:50 PM, passers-by found the approximately tall and only body of a 15-to-16-year-old girl. The body had a number of injuries all over which indicated serious abuse suffered over a period of years, none of which had been treated by a doctor. Among other things, her arms were malformed as a result of healed fractures, there were numerous longer scars in the area of the legs, trunk and forehead, burn scars from cigarettes, and a cauliflower ear caused by injury were found during the autopsy. It is believed that the girl looked about two years younger than her actual age and that she had dark brown hair, about long. Her teeth were in poor condition, and there were no wisdom teeth. Her eye color was no longer ascertainable. The victim had probably been in the water for 12‚Äì14 hours. Death occurred as a result of two bluntly fractured ribs that injured the lungs and spleen, no more than three days before the discovery of the body. The body was tied up and weighed down with a parasol stand and thrown into the Main. Investigations revealed that the girl most likely was thrown into the water between the Griesheim barrage and the W√∂rthspitze. Among other things, due to a scarf-like object she had on her, it is assumed that the girl originated from the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area, but was living in the Frankfurt Rhine-Main area, perhaps as a servant. However, on-site investigation revealed no clues about her identity or that of her killer(s). It cannot be excluded that the girl entered through diplomatic circles, in which investigations are difficult due to political immunity. The body, financed by donations from the investigators, was buried in the Heiligenstock cemetery. The case receives substantial attention even after more than ten years. ==See also== *List of unsolved murders == References == == External links == * Case on the website of the Federal Criminal Police Office (accessed on October 8, 201^6) * The girl from the Main from Taunus Zeitung (Frankfurter Neue Presse), dated July 30, 2011 (accessed June 30, 2016) * First report on \\"Aktenzeichen XY ‚Ä¶ ungel√∂st\\", dated September 7, 2001 (accessed August 1, 2018) * Second report, from 2:50 of \\"Aktenzeichen XY ‚Ä¶ ungel√∂st\\", dated June 24, 2009 (accessed August 1, 2018) Category:1980s births Category:2001 crimes Category:2001 deaths Category:Deaths by person in Germany Category:Female murder victims Category:People from Frankfurt Category:Unidentified murder victims Category:Unsolved murders in Germany ","title":"Girl from the Main"},{"id":"63905054","text":"Marion Hughes (born 18 May 1968) is an Irish equestrian.

Savage is most notable as a chief innovator in the field of steam powered fairground machinery and later as mayor of Kings Lynn, Norfolk. He was the inventor of a system for running fairground carousels using a horizontally-mounted steam engine at its centre. His carousels were exported all over the world. By 1870, he was manufacturing carousels with velocipedes (an early type of bicycle) and he soon began experimenting with other possibilities, including a roundabout with boats that would pitch and roll on cranks with a circular motion, a ride he called 'Sea-on-Land'. Savage applied a similar innovation to the more traditional mount of the horse; he installed gears and offset cranks on the platform carousels, thus giving the animals their well-known up-and-down motion as they travelled around the center pole ‚Äì the \\"galloping horse\\". The platform served as a position guide for the bottom of the pole and as a place for people to walk or other stationary animals or chariots to be placed. He called this ride the 'Platform Gallopers'. He also developed the 'platform-slide' which allowed the mounts to swing out concentrically as the carousel built up speed. Savage's amusement ride, Sea- On-Land, where the riders would pitch up and down as if they were on the sea. His \\"galloping horse\\" innovation is seen on carousels today. == Biography == Savage was born in Hevingham, Norfolk, during the reign of George IV, a period in which agriculture in the UK was at a low ebb. His early years provided him with a patchy education and he remained only semi-literate throughout his life. When his father, William Savage, was found guilty of poaching (a serious matter at that time), resulting in a sentence of 14 years penal servitude in Tasmania, Frederick‚Äôs work as a hurdle-maker on a local country estate proved inadequate to feed the family. In search of a better way of life, Savage entered the service of Thomas Cooper, Whitesmith and Machine Maker. Savage married Susannah Bloyce in 1850. He also sought employment with Charles Willett of Kings Lynn, credited as a brazier, tinplate worker, ironmonger, wholesale and retail dealer, whitesmith and bell hanger. In 1851, Savage move to King‚Äôs Lynn on the north Norfolk coast with his wife. Shortly after this, Willet retired, allowing Savage to begin his own operations. His new company produced engines to power agricultural machinery, as well as engines for carousels and merry-go-rounds. In 1872, Savage moved the business to St Nicholas Ironworks in King‚Äôs Lynn. Savage was appointed a Justice of the Peace (JP) and was appointed Mayor of Kings Lynn from 1889 to 1890. A monument to him was unveiled on the 27th of May 1892 in Kings Lynn. Savage died in 1897. == References == Category:English mechanical engineers Category:1828 births Category:1897 deaths ","title":"Frederick Savage (engineer)"},{"id":"63905154","text":"Azerbaijan‚ÄìKenya relations are bilateral relations between the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Kenya in the diplomatic, cultural, socio- economic and other spheres.

The inscription was discovered on 1 May 2018 in Hebbal. The inscription is on a Ooralivu Veeragallu in honour of Hebbal native Kittayya. Ooralivu veeragallu‚Äôs are memorial stones erected in honour of a person martyred defending an attack on his or her town. Discovered by a few residents in Hebbal, this inscription was deciphered by P.V. Krishnamurthy, professor of epigraphy at the Kannada Sahithya Parishad as an inscription from the era of Ganga King Sripurusha in the 8th century CE. The Ooralivu Veeragallu inscription is now installed in a crowd-funded Ganga style stone mantapa adjoining the Hebbal city library, Bangalore. ==Discovery and dating == Until May 2018, lying in a roadside ditch close to Hebbal village gate were four ancient puja stones. These were in danger of being buried in any road development project. Dilip Kshatriya, a resident of Hebbal contacted Revival Heritage Hub (RHH), a Bengaluru based organization working in the area of heritage conservation and with their support, the four \\"puja\\" stones were shifted to an adjacent BBMP office. Of these four stones, one of which a Veeragallu when dug revealed a hitherto unknown and undocumented inscription on the portion that was buried under the earth. This veeragallu inscription was subsequently deciphered by Dr. P.V. Krishnamurthy an eminent Kannada epigraphist and dated to 750 CE. When discovered parts of the veeragallu had flaked and the inscription somewhat weathered. A 3D digital scan assisted in reading the inscription completely. On Palaeographic considerations, the date of the inscription is assigned to 750CE. In the absence of an explicit date mentioned in an inscription, it is a traditional practice to assign a date to the closest 10, 50, or 100th year on palaeographical considerations. ==Transliteration of the text in modern English== Flour trace of the 750CE Hebbal-Kittayya inscription The text of the inscription in Purvada halegannada language and written in Ganga period Kannada script was deciphered by eminent epigraphist Dr. P.V.

The Western Ganga dynasty were a powerful Southern Indian dynasty from 400-1000CE. Sripurusha‚Äôs kingdom referred to as Gangavadi 96000 extended to the regions of modern-day Kolar, Bangalore, Krishnagiri, Salem, Erode, Mandya, Mysore, Coorg, Chikamagalur, Shimoga and Tumkur districts. Numerous veeragallus found from this period in these regions are testimonies to the fierce battles and skirmishes between the Gangas and the Rashtrakutas during this period. == Etymology of the place name Hebbal == The following is the etymology for the place-name Hebbal. piriya (big) + polal (town) in halegannada. piriya + po·∏ªal = per-bo·∏ªal > pervvo·∏ªal > perbbo·∏ªal > perbbo·∏∑ > pebbo·∏∑ > pebbƒÅ·∏∑a > hebbƒÅ·∏∑a ‡≤™‡≤ø‡≤∞‡≤ø‡≤Ø + ‡≤™‡≥ä‡≥û‡≤≤‡≥ç = ‡≤™‡≥Ü‡≤∞‚Äç‡≥ç‡≤¨‡≥ä‡≥û‡≤≤‡≥ç > ‡≤™‡≥Ü‡≤∞‡≥ç‡≤µ‡≥ç‡≤µ‡≥ä‡≥û‡≤≤‡≥ç > ‡≤™‡≥Ü‡≤∞‡≥ç‡≤¨‡≥ç‡≤¨‡≥ä‡≥û‡≤≤‡≥ç > ‡≤™‡≥Ü‡≤∞‡≥ç‡≤¨‡≥ç‡≤¨‡≥ä‡≤≥‡≥ç > ‡≤™‡≥Ü‡≤¨‡≥ç‡≤¨‡≥ä‡≤≥‡≥ç > ‡≤™‡≥Ü‡≤¨‡≥ç‡≤¨‡≤æ‡≤≥ > ‡≤π‡≥Ü‡≤¨‡≥ç‡≤¨‡≤æ‡≤≥ Between the 9th & 11th centuries many words in the Kannada language beginning with the character pa (‡≤™), the pa was replaced with character ha (‡≤π) (e.g, puli->huli, paalu-> haalu). Similarly in some words containing a va (‡≤µ), the va was replaced by a ba (‡≤¨). Over the centuries perbolal has become hebbal today. == Importance of the Inscription == # The Hebbal-Kittayya inscription is the oldest intact Kannada inscription in the city of Bengaluru. For comparison, it predates the earliest available literary work in Kannada, Kavirajamarga by about 100 years and provides an idea of the form and shape of characters that would have been used in this famous literary work by its author. # Being the oldest inscription in Bengaluru, Kittayya named in the inscription is the first documented resident of modern-day Bengaluru. This is the reason why he is fondly referred to as Bengaluru's first citizen by many historians. == The crowd-funded Ganga style mantapa == Inauguration of the crowdfunded Ganga style mantapa Bangalore once had about 160+ inscription stones documented in the Epigraphia Carnatica Vol 9, 1905ed. However, an on the ground verification shows only some 50 of these inscription stones are still around today. The 100+ inscription stones having been lost to callous development. In view of this and considering that a 750CE era inscription stone being discovered within the city as extremely improbable, a citizens group working for the conservation and awareness Bangalore‚Äôs inscriptions ‚ÄúInscription Stones of Bangalore‚Äù launched a project to build a mantapa (pavilion) befitting enough for the Hebbal-Kittayya inscription. Yashaswini Sharma a conservation architect designed on pro-bono basis a Ganga style mantapa to house the inscription and the crowdfunding effort culminated in the completion of the mantapa in January 2020. Residents of Hebbal formally inaugurated-celebrated the completion of the mantapa by integrating it into their Sankranthi (Harvest festival) celebrations on 14 January 2020. ==See also== *Indian inscriptions *Kannada inscriptions *Early Indian epigraphy *History of Bangalore *Western Ganga dynasty *Hindu temple architecture ==References== Category:Kannada literature Category:Literature of Karnataka Category:History of Bangalore ","title":"Hebbal-Kittayya inscription"},{"id":"63905279","text":"Danai Tsatsou (born 12 July 1980) is a Greek equestrian.

The church is decorated with church murals from both the 12th and the 16th centuries, and still has some medieval furnishings. ==History== The construction date of the church is not known, but it appears to have been built during the third quarter of the 12th century. The tower, which originally was higher than today, was built somewhat later, probably during the 13th century, while the church porch was added in the 16th century. The vaults of the nave are from the 15th century. Additional changes to the church were made in the 19th century. The ceiling of the chancel was installed in 1839, and in 1868 the church was equipped with new, larger windows. A comprehensive refurbishment of the interior was carried out between 1883 and 1884. Several repairs and restorations have also been made during the 20th and 21st centuries, including a large restoration in 1956, and restorations of the medieval church murals in 1954 and 2001. ==Murals and furnishings== View of the murals in the eastern vault Medieval paintings were discovered under layers of whitewash in 1951 and subsequently restored. They consist of two separate sets of murals. On the chancel arch there are Romanesque paintings from the construction period of the church, of high artisanal quality. They have been somewhat damaged by the construction of new vaults during the 15th century as well as by being covered by whitewash. Of later date is the set of murals which decorate the four vaults of the nave; they were probably made in the first quarter of the 16th century and are in a Late Gothic style. The southernmost vault contains a depiction of Hell; the western vault the Triumphal entry into Jerusalem of Christ; the northern vault Saint Peter at the gates of Heaven and the easternmost vault contains a depiction of Christ in Majesty with Mary and John the Baptist by his side. Among the church furnishings, the baptismal font is the oldest, dating from the 12th century. The church also owns two medieval wooden statuettes, one from the 13th century of Mary with the infant Christ, while the other is an early 16th century depiction of either Martin of Tours or Saint George. The pulpit was made in 1578 and altered in 1738. The church bell was made in 1648.

She looked after people all her life and the organisation she created, the Guardianship Society, is now known as the Grace Eyre Foundation. She believed that people with disabilities should be cared for in the community. ==Life== Woodhead was born in Brighton in 1864. Her father was a Major, an agent for the navy, and he and Emily (born Clements) Woodhead had eleven children (One source says 12). Grace was the penultimate. She attended the local high school for girls before going on to Lady Margaret Hall in 1883 in the company of her younger sister, Hilda. She left university in 1885. Grace Eyre Foundation van outside the former United Methodist Church in Hove In 1895 she was living in London and she was concerned by the treatment of people with learning disabilities. At the time the default solution was to place them in institutions. Woodhead arranged for them to have holidays in Heathfield, East Sussex using, at times, her home in Hove. She believed that these children should be cared for in the community. By 1898 the organisation began to take shape although the name of the Guardianship Society was formally registered in line with the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913. In 1914 (what may have been) the first British day- centre was opened in Brighton establishing Care in the Community. In the 1920s they bought two farms in Sussex so that men could learn rural skills. These farms operated until 1959. ==Death and legacy== Brighton & Hove bus named for Grace Eyre Woodhead Woodhead died in Brighton in 1936. After she died the whole organisation had to be restructured as up till then it had all revolved around Woodhead. In 1950 the Guardianship Society moved to a new headquarters in Hove at the old Methodist Church Hall. In 1988 the society adopted the name of its founder and became the Grace Eyre Foundation after 75 years since its registration. == References == Category:1864 births Category:1936 deaths Category:People from Brighton Category:Alumni of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford Category:Disability rights activists Category:British philanthropists Category:People educated at Brighton and Hove High School ","title":"Grace Woodhead"},{"id":"63905467","text":"Hyderabad city is the fourth-most populous city and sixth-most populous urban agglomeration in India.

The quarry has been enlarged in 1911 from 1 acre to 25 acres, giving a visible supply of 1,500,000 cu. yd. of trap rock. == Crushing plant and narrow-gauge railway == Industrial railway and side-dump cars for transporting rock to the breaker at Fairview Quarry, 1911 The crushing equipment consisted of one No. 4 and two No. 6 Allis-Chalmers crushing plants, which had a combined capacity of 600 cu. yd. a day, which was practically equal to that of the storage bins. The blasted rock was brought to the crusher in narrow-gauge railway cars instead of by horse or oxen teams, as it had been the former practice.‚Äô‚ÄôPublic Service Railway of New Jersey - Way Department.‚Äô‚Äô Electric Railway Journal, Vol. 38, No. 15, 7 October 1911, page 581-582 and Plate XX == Unique features == One of the interesting features of the plant was that all apparatus, except the air drills, was electrically operated, the combined motor capacity of the crushers and air compressors being about 500 hp. Another interesting feature was the use of manganese steel for the conveyor buckets, and for the inner shelves of the screens. This type of reinforcement has proved very effective in reducing the frequency and total cost of renewals. The cost of delivering crushed stone from the Fairview quarry alongside of any job within a radius of 20 miles averaged 47 cents per cubic yard, but was lowered to 38 cents per cubic yard by changing to rail-car haulage. Both figures include labour, power, maintenance of line and track equipment and general expenses. The economy was effected by making use of returning empty cars for the distribution of supplies from Passaic Wharf. The operation of this quarry has proved satisfactory to the Public Service Railway of New Jersey from two important standpoints: * It has produced a considerable saving over the cost per cubic yard, but more important still, it has eliminated all dependence upon outside quarries. * Consequently, track work had no longer to be delayed because of the failure of contractors to make deliveries. It was planned in autumn 1911, to operate the quarry through the winter months, so that plenty of crushed rock would be available for spring operations, and even for sale to outside parties. The quarry was in charge of a superintendent, who reported to the superintendent of Maintenance of Way. He was assisted by a clerk, a general electrician, a machinist, a dynamo man and a boss driller. About eighty-five men are employed during the busy season. == References == == External links == * Belmont-Gurnee Stone Co.

Its purpose was to determine the location and fate of missing Belgian citizens deported to the Soviet Union at the end of the Second World War. Some of these Belgians had served in volunteer units on the Eastern Front or been conscripted into the Wehrmacht, but others were labour conscripts, prisoners of war or political prisoners liberated by the Red Army but then conscripted to Soviet labour camps. The founder of the association, Corneille Vander Borght (1893‚Äì1980), was a Belgian veteran of the First World War whose son, Paul (born 1921), a non-commissioned officer in the Belgian Army during the Battle of Belgium of 1940, had escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany in 1942 but been rearrested by the Germans as a political prisoner in 1944. After being liberated by the Red Army he was misidentified as a fugitive Nazi and deported to the Soviet Union, where his fate remains unknown. The association was formally founded on 23 July 1948, and its statutes were published in the Belgian official journal on 16 September 1948. After a wave of returns up to the spring of 1947, a further 256 Belgians were repatriated from the Soviet Union between 1947 and 1962. Thereafter the Soviet authorities denied any knowledge of further detainees. New interest in the disappeared was stimulated in 1979, when Soviet dissidents publicised the presence of 16 Belgian prisoners in a camp in Mordovia. In 1995, Belgian foreign minister Erik Derycke estimated that up to 400 Belgians had remained unaccounted for. The association was wound up on 4 March 2009, when most of those missing would have been aged in their 100s. Its archive is now held by the Belgian Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society. ==References== ==Further reading== * Corneille Vander Borght, Le scandale des Disparus, 1940-1945 (Brussels, 1977) * Willy Fautr√© and Guido De Latte, Nos prisonniers du goulag ([Soignies], 1980) Category:1948 establishments in Belgium Category:2009 disestablishments in Belgium Category:Non-profit organisations based in Belgium Category:Missing people organizations ","title":"Association belge des familles des disparus"},{"id":"63905681","text":"Antonis Petris (born 13 November 1958) is a Greek equestrian.

He played mainly in the position as Striker, but also as midfielder. St√∂cklin joined Basel's first team for their 1945‚Äì46 season under team manager Max Barras as they played in the Nationalliga B. After playing in two test games and in one Swiss Cup match, St√∂cklin played his domestic league debut for the club in the away game on 14 April 1946. He scored his first league goal for his club in the same match as Basel won 2‚Äì0 against Luzern. In his very next game, two weeks later, on 28 April St√∂cklin scored four goals as Basel beat Fribourg 6‚Äì1 in the home match at the Landhof. Basel ended that season with 43 points in 1st position to win the Nationalliga B and win promotion. During the teams next season (1946‚Äì47) Basel advanced to the Swiss Cup-Final, which was played in the Stadion Neufeld in Bern on 7 April 1947. Basel won the final 3‚Äì0 against Lausanne-Sport. In the final St√∂cklin scored two goals and Ren√© Bader the other. Team manager Anton Schall led Basel to win the Cup, but he died shortly afterwards at the age of 40 years during a workout on the football field. Following this unhappy event, team captain Ernst Hufschmid later took over as player-manager. In the 1946‚Äì47 Nationalliga A season St√∂cklin was his teams best goal scorer with 11 goals. In the domestic league match on 21 March 1948 away against AC Bellinzona St√∂cklin scored a hat-trick as Basel won by five goals to one. St√∂cklin played for Basel for seven years. But he missed Basel's first championship title in 1953 due to health reasons, in fact he was forced to end his active football career during that year. Between the years 1945 and 1952 St√∂cklin played a total of 238 games for Basel scoring a total of 90 goals. 156 of these games were in the Swiss Serie A, 27 in the Swiss Cup and 55 were friendly games. He scored 61 goals in the domestic league, seven in the cup and the other 22 were scored during the test games. Subsequently, St√∂cklin moved onto training and coaching, primarily to the young players of SC Binningen, where he worked as a youth coach until into the 1980s. ==References== ==Sources== * Rotblau: Jahrbuch Saison 2017/2018.

As a two-year-old in 2016 she showed promising form as she won her second of her three races and finished a close fourth in the Prix Marcel Boussac. In the following year she won the Prix de la Grotte on her seasonal debut and recovered from defeats in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches and Prix de Sandringham to record her biggest win in the Prix de Diane. She was beaten in her three subsequent races and was retired from racing at the end of the year. She died in 2018. ==Background== Senga was a bay mare with a white blaze bred in Kentucky by Flaxman Holdings, a company set up to manage the racing interests of her owners the Niarchos family. She was sent into training with Pascal Bary at Chantilly and was ridden in all of his races by St√©phane Pasquier. She was from the third crop of foals sired by Blame, who was the American Champion Older Dirt Male Horse in 2010, when he won the Breeders' Cup Classic. Blame's other progeny include Marley's Freedom (Ballerina Stakes), Nadal (Arkansas Derby) and Fault (Santa Margarita Stakes). Senga's dam Beta Leo showed modest racing ability, winning one minor race from five starts in France. She was a daughter of the Prix de Cabourg winner Denebola who was in turn a daughter of Coup de Genie who won the Prix Morny and was a full-sister to Machiavellian. During Senga's racing career Longchamp Racecourse was closed for redevelopment and many major races were transferred to other tracks. ==Racing career== ===2016: two-year-old season=== Senga made her debut at Deauville Racecourse on 9 August when she started at odds of 3.4/1 for a maiden race over 1500 metres and finished second by three quarters of a length to the favourite La Cochere having taken the lead 200 metres from the finish before being overtaken in the final strides. Four weeks later the filly was matched against colts in a minor race over 1600 metres at Saint- Cloud Racecourse and recorded her first success, beating the Andr√© Fabre- trained favourite Last Kingdom by two lengths after taking the lead 150 metres from the finish. On her final run of the season Senga was stepped up in class for the Group 1 Prix Marcel Boussac, run that year over 1600 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 2 October. Starting a 16/1 outsider she pulled hard in the early stages and briefly struggled to obtain a clear run in the straight but finished strongly to finish fourth behind Wuheida, Promise To Be True and Dabyah, beaten one and three quarter lengths by the winner. ===2017: three- year-old season=== On her first appearance as a three-year-old Senga started favourite for the Group 3 Prix de la Grotte, run that year over 1600 metres at Chantilly on 16 April, with the best fancied of her six opponents being the unbeaten Lady Frankel and the Prix d'Aumale winner Toulifaut. After racing \\"keenly\\" in fourth place she took the lead approaching the last 200 metres and won \\"a shade cosily\\" by a length from La Sardane. After the race Bary said \\"She was a bit nervous beforehand, maybe because she was fresh, but they tend to be a little like that in the family. She relaxed well during the race, she had the perfect trip and quickened well to show her class. It was not too hard a race and the perfect re-introduction this year.\\" On 13 May Senga started favourite for the Group 1 Poule d'Essai des Pouliches at Deauville but after racing just behind the leaders for most of the way she tired on the very soft ground and came home eleventh of the eighteen runners behind Precieuse. In the Group 2 Prix de Sandringham at Chantilly on 6 June she was restrained in the early stages before finishing well but never looked likely to win and came home third of the five runners behind La Sardane and Gold Luck. Two weeks after her defeat in the Prix de Sandringham Senga was one of sixteen fillies to contest the Group 1 Prix de Diane over 2100 metres at Chantilly and started a 21.8/1 outsider. The Musidora Stakes winner Shutter Spead (who had beaten Enable in April) started favourite while the other contenders included Sistercharlie, Rhododendron, Terrakova (Prix Cl√©op√¢tre) and Kitesurf (Prix de Royaumont). Senga gave some trouble before the start as she was reluctant to enter stalls, and settled towards the rear of the field as the outsiders Normandie and Haya of Fortune set the pace. She produced a sustained run on the outside in the straight, overtook Shutter Speed 300 metres from the finish and stayed on in the closing stages to win by a length from the fast-finishing Sistercharlie. Pascal Bary commented \\"I never gave up on her. She's got a fantastic pedigree and a great physique\\". After a two-month break Senga returned in the Prix de la Nonette over 2000 metres at Deauville on 19 August in which she finished third of the nine runners behind the Prix Saint-Alary winner Sobetsu and Onthemoonagain after being outpaced in the closing stages. She was then matched against older fillies and mares in the Group 1 Prix de l'Op√©ra run that year over 2000 metres at Chantilly on 1 October but made little impact and came home eleventh behind Rhododendron, beaten ten and three quarter lengths by the winner. For her final run of the year, Senga was sent to California for the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Del Mar Racetrack on 4 November, in which she started at odds of 9/1. After tracking the leaders she made some progress in the straight but was unable to maintain her challenge and finished eighth behind Wuheida. ==Breeding record== At the end of her racing career Senga was retired to become a broodmare. She was in foal to Galileo when she died on 28 June 2018. ==Pedigree== *Senga was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Mr. Prospector, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree. ==References== Category:2014 racehorse births Category:2018 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in France Category:Thoroughbred family 2-d ","title":"Senga (horse)"},{"id":"63905772","text":"Md.

The town hall, which is the headquarters of Newham London Borough Council, is a Grade II* listed building. ==History== Offices at Newham Dockside In the early 20th century the East Ham Urban District Council held its meetings in the local school board offices in Wakefield Street. Following a rapid growth in the local population, civic leaders decided to procure purpose-built council offices: the site chosen for the new building was a plot of open land on the corner of Barking Road and High Street South. The foundation stone for the new building was laid in 1901. It was designed by Henry Cheers and Joseph Smith in the Renaissance style, built by D.W. Barker and was officially opened by the philanthropist, John Passmore Edwards, on 5 February 1903. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage with six bays facing onto Barking Road; the right hand section featured a high tower and a large archway to the extreme right inscribed with the words \\"Public Hall\\" above. A long extension to the south of the main building was completed in 1910 and a three-storey annex was built to the east on Barking Road in 1939. Internally, the principal rooms were the public hall, the council chamber and the mayor's parlour. The building became \\"Newham Town Hall\\" after the area was designated the Municipal Borough of East Ham in 1904; the area became the County Borough of East Ham in 1915. The building continued to be the local seat of government after the formation of the London Borough of Newham in 1965. An additional building in Stratford, which was designed by the borough architect, Ken Lund, and Norman White in the shape of a ziggurat, was completed in May 1976; it was to have been joined by another, larger ziggurat, but after reductions in funding and criticism of the design the original ziggurat was demolished in February 1998. Most council officers and their departments were re-located to Newham Dockside (Building 1000 in Dockside Road) in 2010. The building had been designed by Aukett Swanke and developed by Development Securities, Standard Life Investments and the London Development Agency as part of a scheme to regenerate the Royal Albert Dock; it had been built by Bowmer + Kirkland at a cost of ¬£70 million and had been completed in June 2004. After the developers had been unable to secure tenants, Newham Council acquired the building for ¬£92 million and initiated a programme of fit-out works at a further cost of ¬£19 million. However, formal meetings of the council continue to take place in the town hall. ==References== Category:Grade II* listed buildings in the London Borough of Newham Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1903 Category:Grade II* listed government buildings ","title":"Newham Town Hall"},{"id":"63905865","text":"V.

(from the Greek ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ \\"after\\" and œÉŒ∑ŒºŒ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ \\"significant\\") is a literary technique theorized and used by Fosco Maraini in his collection of poems Gn√≤si delle f√†nfole of 1978. == Overview == While semantics is that part of linguistics that studies the meaning of words (lexical semantics), of the sets of words, of phrases (phrasal semantics), and of texts, metasemantics, in the sense given by the Maraini, goes beyond the meaning of words and consists of the use, within the text, of words without meaning, but having a familiar sound to the language to which the text itself belongs, and which must still follow the syntactical and grammatical rules (in the case of Fosco Maraini, the Italian language). One can attribute more or less arbitrary meanings to these words by their sound and their position within the text. A language similar to this technique, mostly defined as nonsense, was also used by Lewis Carroll in his poem Jabberwocky published in 1871. Other examples of proto-metasemantic expressions in the English language date back to the beginning of 16th century with the onomatopoeic sounds typical of gibberish. The most famous example of metasemantic poetry, in the original meaning of the term as given by Maraini, is his poem Il Lonfo, also known for the recitation made by Gigi Proietti in 2005 (in the transmission of Renzo Arbore Speciale per me - meno siamo meglio stiamo / Special for me - the less we are, the better we are), as well as for its recitation in the episode on February 7, 2007 the program Parla con me (Talk to Me), conducted on Rai 3 by Serena Dandini. == Notes == == References == * Category:Narrative techniques ","title":"Metasemantic poetry"},{"id":"63905906","text":"Vestergade 3 is a Neoclassical property in the Old Town of Copenhagen, Denmark.

As part of its social service scheme, the movement has built up to ten schools and two hospitals in located in Apapa and Ojokoro, Lagos. ==History== === Establishment === The Ahmadiyya Movement was founded in British India by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1836-1906), an Islamic reformist and mystic, who in 1891 claimed that he was a prophet, mujaddid (‚Äúrenewer‚Äù), and the Messiah or Mahdi anticipated by Muslims. The Ahmadiyya Movement was formally organized in Lagos in 1916 but there are several, though not contradictory, versions of how Ahmadiyya came to Nigeria. One account has it that in 1913, one school teacher called Hamid stumbled upon a copy of the Review of Religion, a journal founded by the Ahmadiyya Movement in Qadian and started communicating with the them. Another version has it that one Lagos businessman, Alhaji Ali Fahm traveled to Egypt in 1914 and got copies of Ahmadiyya literature which he brought to Nigeria, after studying which he and some of his friends wrote to the headquarters of the Movement in Qadian to declare that intention of becoming members of the movement. Alhaji Imran Adewuyi Onibudo was one of those who claimed to have taken the bia‚Äôah (oath of allegiance) in 1914.\\"About us, Khuddam \\"About us, Dawah Nigeria Many pioneer members of the society were associated with the Muslim Literary Society in Lagos, headed by Muhammed Basil Agusto, a Lagosian of Afro-Brazilian heritage. Agusto had started a short- lived school for Muslims and had interest in creating awareness about Western education among the Muslim Jamaat. Between 1916 and 1919, Agusto was the focal point of the group, he published his own pamphlets to complement those he requested from Qadian and the movement's gatherings were predominantly held in his private residence. Agusto may have also influenced the entry of many Afro- Brazilians into the movement in 1919. In 1919, he was appointed its first president and was succeeded by Jibril Martin when Agusto traveled to London to earn a law degree. In London, he became acquainted with the Lahore faction and broke off from the Qadians. When he returned to Nigeria in 1924, he established his own group, the Islamic Society of Nigeria. === 1920 - 1940 === In the beginning, Ahmadis were challenged by orthodox Muslims, a cleric, Adamu Animashaun used his printing press to attack the movement, a sustained vitriol directed towards the Ahmadis was alleged to have caused an assault on members in 1921. Animashaun and other Muslims were found responsible for instigating hostilities against the Ahmadis and were handed three-month sentences in prison, thereafter physical confrontation against the members stopped. Among members closing the gap in education between Christians and Muslims in Lagos was one of their unifying interests. Adherents of the movement were among the earliest Lagosians to embrace Western education, two prominent members, Jibril Martin and Mohammed Agusto are the pioneer Muslim lawyers from Nigeria while another member, Abdul Hamid Saka Tinubu was the earliest trained Muslim doctor in the country. To promote its interest in education, in 1922, the movement established a primary school in Elegbeta, Lagos Island, Lagos. Prior to the establishment of the school, a request for an Ahmadi teacher from India was placed in 1921, Maulana Abdur Rahim Nayyar, a representative of the Ahmadiyya movement in colonial India and who was an associate of Ghulam Ahmad was sent to Nigeria as missionary in charge. Colonial authorities were initially suspicious about the presence of Nayyar within the fragile Muslim community in Lagos which had split into five groups, the Lemomu group, the Quranic group, the Ahmadis, Jamaat party, and the Ogunro group. Suspicions were doused after Nayyar gave an interview stating he was in Lagos to preach adherence to the customs written in the Quran and also to the laws of the colonial government. He delivered his first lecture at the non Ahmadi Shitta Bey mosque and was active in bringing in new members to the movement. Nayyar did not make inroads within the other factions with the exception of the Quranic group, primarily based in Okepopo and Aroloya. After an agreement to merge with Ahmadiyya, Imam Dabiri of the Quranic group was selected as Chief Imam. Dabiri was succeeded in the 1930s by Imam Ajose. Nayyar's stay in Lagos coincided with the establishment of additional branches in Ebutte-Meta and Epe. Movement activities commenced in Yaba in 1921, and within two years, members had established missions in Ibadan, Kano and Zaria. Expansion into Ado-Odo, Otta, Ijede and Ondo was completed by the mid 1930s. Between 1933 and 1940, internal wrangling caused a split within the mission into two factions. A group was loyal to Imam Ajose and another group was loyal to F. R. Hakeem a Pakistani and representative of the Khalifa who aspired to replace Imam Ajose as lead Imam. Unlike, Nayyar's mellow demeanor, Hakim was heavily involved in the affairs of the Ahmadi's and his presence caused dissension in the group. A faction surrounded Imam Ajose and sought some form of local autonomy while Hakeem wanted strict adherence to the Ahmadi doctrines. The Khalifa withdrew recognition of the Ajose group and in 1940, the Hakeem led Ahmadiyya Muslim Mission was formally inaugurated in the country with the support of the Khalifa. The Ajose group maintained the name, the Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam and the Hakeem group was launched with the name Ahmadiyya Muslim Mission. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Mission later came to represent the core of the Ahmadi's in Nigeria. === 1940 - 1970 === After the split, both groups gained members within the Yoruba Muslim communities and also among Muslims in Etsako, Edo State and in Nasarawa. In Egbado division, the support of a local produce merchant led to the establishment of a mission in Ilaro. A plot of land was acquired in the Sabo area of town and on the land a mosque was built to hold jumat services and Quranic lessons for children. Proselytizing activities of this group strengthened a young mission in Abeokuta. A mission house located in Idumagbo was completed in 1945 and in 1951, the mission began distributing a weekly newsletter, The Truth, to proselytize the ideals of the movement. === 1970 - present === In 1970, Mirza Nazir Ahmad, the third Khalifa visited the country, he was hosted by in Lagos by General Gowon. Ahmad inaugurated a social service program to expand educational and medical facilities to be managed by the movement. He returned in 1980, this time not only meeting members in Lagos, Ilaro and Ibadan but members in other branches such as those in Benin and in Kano. In the 1970's, the Imam Ajose group further split with a section renamed Anwar ul Islam. Since the split, the majority of Ahmadis in Nigeria are predominantly members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Mission, the faction loyal to the Khalifa's choice of Hakeem as amir in 1940. In 1988, the fourth Khalifa visited the country, he appointed Abdul Rasheed Agboola as the first Nigerian Missionary in Charge. == Organizational structure == The movement's governance structure is led by the Amir also known as the Missionary in Charge, he is assisted by six deputy Amirs, in addition, there is a national executive committee which is replicated in local circuits. Nayyar, the first amir and missionary in charge had established a national executive committee in 1921. The national executive committee is composed of the Secretary- General, secretary in charge of Tabligh, auditor, treasurer and representatives of branches within the movement. === Auxiliaries in Nigeria === * Majlis Ansarullah * Lajna Imaillah * Majlis Khuddam * Majlis Atfal * Nasirat * Ahmadi Muslim Students' Association ==See also== *Islam in Nigeria ==Reference== Category:Religious faiths, traditions, and movements ","title":"Ahmadiyya in Nigeria"},{"id":"63905939","text":"ƒåSD Class 477.0 is the last type of steam locomotive made by ƒåKD for Czechoslovak State Railways.

However, said girl, now an adult, reported to the police in 2006, and that theory was dismissed. Based on later research on the epiphyseal plates, the Heul Girl would have been 12-to-15 years old at the time of death, putting her date of birth between 1960 and 1965. Isotope research on her teeth showed that the decedent probably lived between the Ruhr and Eifel regions of Germany for the first seven years of her life. Around 1975, the child was likely in East Germany or elsewhere in Eastern Europe. The year prior to her death, she supposedly stayed in either West Germany or the Netherlands. In that year, the girl received particularly poor nutrition, which may indicate extreme poverty or a possible kidnapping. In 2012, a witness stated that in 1976, the girl was seen being \\"thrown out\\" by two men between the ages of 30 and 40, which was seen by multiple people.

He was baptised in the Amstelkerk on 16 February 1757. Linthorst was a writer of plays and political pamphlets and was a member of the provincial government of Utrecht between 1796 and 1798. He was then elected member of the Representative Body of the Batavian Republic, where he first represented the constituency of Soestdijk and later Amsterdam-VIII. For some reason, Linthorst continued his political career as a colonial administrator on the Dutch Gold Coast. He kept a journal of his journey to the Gold Coast, which he intended to publish. The manuscript he sent to his friend Antonie Lodewijk Heijstek in the Batavian Republic was confisquated by the British, however, and never reached Heijstek. Linthorst was appointed resident of Fort Cr√®vec≈ìur in Accra on 20 April 1802 and served there until he took over as governor-general of the Dutch Gold Coast on 16 June 1805, after his predecessor Isaac de Roever repatriated to the Batavian Republic to recover from illness. His appointment proved controversial, as it was done by the Small Council in Elmina, without the presence of the resident of Fort Saint Anthony Jan Frederik K√∂nig, who was the more senior resident on the Gold Coast and the more logical successor of De Roever. K√∂nig protested the procedure, but nevertheless accepted the decision made. All doubts on the legitimacy of Linthorst's rule were taken away, however, when he was officially appointed as governor-general by the authorities in the Batavian Republic on 5 August 1805. During Linthorst's time in office the Ashanti‚ÄìFante War broke out, which among other things resulted in the Fante occupation of Fort Amsterdam. Linthorst blamed this on the lack of military supplies from the metropole, which at the time was going through a turbulent period in which the French client state of the Batavian Republic was replaced by a Kingdom of Holland headed by Louis Bonaparte as king. In 1807, he sent a proposal for colonisation of the Gold Coast to The Hague. Pieter Linthorst died in office on 21 July 1807. == Personal life == Pieter Linthorst was married to Catharina Christina Kestlij, who died in 1799. After her death, he married Maria de Jongh (1779‚Äì1841) in 1802. == Publications == === Plays === *De her√´eniging: tooneelspel in 5 bedrijven *De patriotten van zeventien honderd zeven-en-negentig: tooneelspel in drie bedryven *De majoor Breekijzer op het vrede feest te Nederoord: blijspel in 5 bedrijven *Deugd en ondeugd, of De gevaarlyke gevolgen van de dweepzucht: tooneelspel in vyf bedryven == Notes == == References == * * * Category:1757 births Category:1807 deaths Category:Colonial governors of the Dutch Gold Coast ","title":"Pieter Linthorst"},{"id":"63905992","text":"Hong Si-hoo (born 8 January 2001) is an South Korean professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for K League 1 side Seongnam. ==Club career== Hong made his professional debut for K League 1 side Seongnam on 9 May 2020 against Gwangju.

The pandemic has affected the Cities of Mississauga and Brampton, and the Town of Caledon, within the Regional Municipality of Peel. As part of the larger closure decisions in Ontario, a stay-at-home order shuttered all nonessential businesses, and caused event cancellations. As of May 2020, Brampton was considered one of the province's main \\"hot spots\\", and a Mississauga nursing home was taken over by the Province after a scathing report from the military. == Background == Brampton City Council voted unanimously in favour of declaring a \\"health care emergency\\" in the city, citing chronic overcrowding of Brampton Civic Hospital, its only full hospital facility. == Timeline == === February === * February 29: Peel Public Health learns that someone with COVID-19 had attended work in the Region for three days, before self-isolating. The workplace was not in Brampton, and the worker lived outside of Peel. === March === * March 5: Peel confirms its first case of COVID-19, a Mississauga man who had travelled on the Grand Princess cruise ship from February 11 to 21. His wife was confirmed as the second carrier. * March 8: A man returning from Germany tests positive for COVID-19 at Brampton Civic Hospital. * March 9: Dr. Jessica Hopkins, the region's Medical Officer of Health, announces her departure.

He was the first hospital employee in Ontario to die of the disease. * April 18: Mississauga reports 137 new cases of COVID-19, which would remain its daily peak as of July 15. === May === * May 25: After Premier Doug Ford mentions that the province has \\"hot spots\\" for COVID, \\"lighting up like a Christmas tree,\\" the Ministry of Health revealing that Peel Region is among the hotspots. Ford later narrowed that to Brampton. * May: Mississauga Food Bank looked to raise $840,000 in response to the pandemic. Basketball player RJ Barrett donated $100,000. === June === * June 6, 7, 17: Black Lives Matter-related protests held at Brampton's Chinguacousy Park, Mississauga's Celebration Square, and the Peel District School Board headquarters. At a June 24 press conference, Dr. Lawrence Loh commented that there was no evidence that these events impacted case numbers. * June 24: Peel Region was given the go-ahead to enter Stage 2 of reopening. === July === * July 2: Dr. Lawrence Loh accepts the position of Medical Officer of Health on a permanent basis. * July 15: Peel Health reports no new cases of COVID-19 in Mississauga, for the first time since March 22. * July 31: Peel Region was allowed by the provincial government to enter Stage 3 of reopening. === October === * October 10: Due to an increase in cases, Peel region was knocked back to a modified Stage 2, along with Toronto, Ottawa - and as of October 19, 2020, York Region. The measures included the closure of indoor dining in bars and restaurants, and the closure of gyms, movie theatres and casinos. The measures are in effect for 28 days. == Cases == , the following LTC homes in Peel have 10 or more confirmed COVID-19 related deaths: * Camilla Care Community LTC (Mississauga) - 64 * Cooksville Care Centre (Mississauga) - 18 * Erin Mills Lodge Nursing Home LTC (Mississauga) - 17 * Village of Erin Meadows LTC (Mississauga) - 19 * Grace Manor (Brampton) - 12 * Villa Forum (Mississauga) - 10 The outbreak at Camilla Care Community in Mississauga was among Ontario's deadliest, receiving attention from The Washington Post. On May 27, the Province of Ontario announced that it would take over management of the facility for two weeks. === Outbreaks === Outbreaks of COVID have been declared at a number of health facilities. As of May 8, outbreaks were declared at: * Bough Beeches Place * Burton Manor * Camilla Care Community; As of May 7, 48 residents had died of COVID-19. * Cooksville Care Centre * Erin Mills Lodge Nursing Home * Extendicare Brampton * Faith Manor Nursing Home * Grace Manor * Greenway by Revera Retirement Village * Ivan Franko Homes * King Gardens Place Retirement Home * Malton Village * Maple Grove Care Community * Peel Manor; At least one resident has died at the facility, in mid-April 2020. * Regency Retirement Residence * Sheridan Villa * Silverthorn Care Community * Sunrise of Mississauga * Tall Pines * Trillium Health Partners, Credit Valley Hospital ** An outbreak was declared March 27, and reported by April 1, after four patients in the rehab unit tested positive. The outbreak ended on May 8. * Trillium Health Partners, Mississauga Hospital * Villa Forum * Village of Erin Meadows * Village of Sandalwood Park In late April, the dormitory-format Ontario Correctional Institute in Brampton was closed after 60 inmates and eight workers tested positive. Inmates were moved to the Toronto South Detention Centre, to allow for a deep clean, and for staff to self-isolate for two weeks. == Government response == Region of Peel continued to hold weekly council meetings. On March 16, Peel municipalities began exempting retail deliveries from noise bylaws, allowing around-the-clock goods movement. The measure was to last 30 days. Mississauga declared a state of emergency on March 23, with Brampton doing the same the next day. Under the Ontario Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, this allowed both various additional abilities including restricting movement, establishment of emergency shelters or health care facilities, and the power to close private businesses. === Transit === Between March 2 and 4, someone with COVID-19 travelled on MiWay transit. This was followed by someone with the virus on a GO Transit leaving Toronto Pearson International Airport. Following this incident, Peel Public Health advised that public transit was still a safe option, and Brampton and Mississauga both announced \\"enhanced cleaning practices.\\" MiWay Mississauga and Brampton Transit were made free starting March 21, with most express services cancelled. Boarding was to take place by the rear doors. == Impacts == === Business closures and event cancellations === In mid-February, the Mississauga Chinese Business Association reports that Chinese restaurants in the city have been 25-50% drops in revenue, attributable to misinformation. At least one business closed and sent employees home after an employee falsely claim of that a family member had tested positive for COVID-19. He was charged with public mischief. An employee at Maple Leaf Foods poultry plant in Brampton tested positive; employees who had contact with them were sent home for self-isolation. The company waited 20 days before publicly acknowledging the diagnosis. The number sick grew to 24 by May 6, according to a Peel Public Health statement. Operations at the facility were suspended in early April. On May 7, United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 175 confirmed the death of a Maple Lodge Farms plant's staff members. After a staff member was diagnosed with COVID-19, Mississauga meat producer Sofina Foods ended its overnight shift to allow for cleaning processes. The ECHL, the league of which the Brampton Beast are part, cancelled the remainder of its season on March 14, 2020. Three workers at Caledon's Amazon plant have tested positive for COVID-19, as of May 20, 2020. === Religion === After gatherings of more than 5 people were banned, services at all places of worship were cancelled. Various congregations took to live streaming their services, from either the place of worship itself (as is the case with Mississauga's St. Maximilian Kolbe Catholic Church) or remotely. Brampton's Har Tikvah synagogue added other online programming, beyond its normal services. Ontario Khalsa Darbar closed its langar to pickup-only. As of April 29, the City of Brampton was allowing staff discretion around enforcement of noise by-laws, in relation to mosques broadcasting adhan (a call to prayer) during the month of Ramadan; it was waiting for a staff report on the topic. At the May 6 meeting, council approved a one-time by-law exemption. Mayor Patrick Brown noted that church bells were exempted in the existing by-law. Mississauga council passed a motion at its April 29 council meeting, allowing mosques to do one adhan each day, which is normally banned by city noise by-law. The item was a \\"walk on item\\" based on a request by the Muslim Council of Peel, meaning that it wasn't on the public agenda, nor was a staff report on the topic available. Since then, two councillors have commented that Mayor Bonnie Crombie provided council with incorrect information on the subject, and that the matter should be revisited. Discussion on the topic has been referred to the city's Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Committee. The move and the criticism that followed received international headlines. Ram Subrahmanian, a member of the group Keep Religion Out Of Peel Region Schools, has received donations for an intended court challenge. A spokesperson for Muslim Canadian Congress commented that \\"many Islamic scholars who have denounced the use of loudspeakers in mosques as against the spirit of Islam.\\" The decision allowed similar exemptions in communities including Windsor; Toronto announced that it would do the same, if asked. == References == == External links == * Novel coronavirus (COVID-19), Region of Peel * COVID pages from City of Mississauga, City of Brampton, Town of Caledon Category:Health in Ontario Peel Peel Peel Category:Regional Municipality of Peel ","title":"COVID-19 pandemic in the Regional Municipality of Peel"},{"id":"63906019","text":"The People's Palace of Culture (Korean: Ïù∏ÎØºÎ¨∏ÌôîÍ∂ÅÏ†Ñ; Hanja: ‰∫∫Ê∞ëÊñáÂåñÂÆÆÊÆø) is a palace and theater located in Pyongyang, North Korea.

During his graduate studies, he performed with the Knoxville Opera as Basilio in Il Barbiere di Siviglia and as a soloist in Verdi‚Äôs Requiem with the Elmhurst Symphony Orchestra. He has performed in many leading opera houses both nationally and internationally, including premiering the role of Lieutenant Horstmayer in Kevin Puts and Minnesota Opera‚Äôs acclaimed and Pulitzer Prize winning Silent Night ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had the new-opera experience that no one gets‚Äù Irvin is quoted to say by Opera News, in singing the same role multiple times. ==Career== Irvin began his career at Orlando Opera in the 2006 season, and continued the following season as a main stage artist. While in Orlando, Irvin also performed the role of Gaston in Beauty and the Beast at Walt Disney World, completing over 700 performances. ‚ÄúI got to be onstage, in front of thousands of people, five days a week, for almost two years,‚Äù Irvin says. ‚ÄúAnd that is not an experience you get - in America - as an opera singer!‚Äù Irvin spent 2008 in residence with Lyric Opera of Chicago‚Äôs Ryan Opera Center. He returned for a second season in 2009-2010. While there he portrayed a number of roles including Zuniga in Carmen, Theseus in A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream, the Imperial Commissioner in Madama Butterfly, the title role in The Mikado, and Bartolo in Le Nozze Di Figaro, among others. In 2011, Irvin performed as Lieutenant Horstmayer in the premier of Kevin Puts‚Äô Silent Night at Minnesota Opera. Having said of Silent Night, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the most amazing opera I have ever had a chance to work on.‚Äù Irvin describes why he feels that way, citing, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a major battle scene about five minutes into the show that is extremely visceral, both for the action and the music,‚Äù He continues, ‚ÄúTen minutes later, there‚Äôs some of the most beautiful music and orchestration I‚Äôve ever heard. You can visualize, just through the music, the sun breaking the crest of the horizon, and the frost on the grass start to melt away, and birds taking off. But it ends darkly, because as the sun comes out, you see all the dead bodies.‚Äù In the 2012-2013 season, Irvin sang in Carmina Burana with the Phoenix Symphony, and debuted at Opera Saratoga as Dick Deadeye in HMS Pinafore, and as Raimondo in Lucia di Lammermoor. In 2013, Irvin played Mandryka in Strauss‚Äôs Arabella at the Minnesota Opera. In early 2015 Irvin sang the Pirate King in the Pensacola Opera production of Gilbert & Sullivan's The Pirates of Penzance Also in 2015, Irvin was seen in Sarasota Opera‚Äôs production of La Boheme as Marcello. In their review of his role in Utah Opera‚Äôs 2016 production of Figaro, The Salt Lake Tribune said of Irvin, ‚ÄúBaritone Craig Irvin was a strong foil, playing Count Almaviva as a suave bully who was redeemed by a lightning bolt of compassion at the end of the opera.‚Äù And in his role that year at LoftOpera as Macbeth, The Observer commented ‚ÄúAs Macbeth, Craig Irvin flaunted a big, steely baritone as striking as his craggy profile.‚Äù Irvin has reprised his premier role of Lieutenant Horstmayer a number of times since his original performance in 2011 at Minnesota Opera, including in 2012 at Opera Philadelphia. Further performances were at Fort Worth Opera and Cincinnati Opera in 2014, Atlanta Opera in 2016, 2019 at Austin Opera, and Utah Opera in 2020. 2017 found Irvin playing Excamillo in Carmen, a role of which the Texas Classical Review stated, ‚ÄúThough each generation finds new secrets in Carmen, Escamillo never changes: he needs a decent dynamic range, a sturdy swagger, and a beautiful, smooth vocal quality, all of which Irvin brought to the table.‚Äù Irvin was then described in his role as Dan Packard as ‚Äúaptly heartless and blustering‚Äù in Dinner at Eight, ‚Äúsinging with a big, commanding baritone‚Äù. In 2018 Irvin appeared twice at the Wexford Festival Opera, once as Sherrif Jack Rance in La Fanciulla Del West, of which Opera Wire said ‚ÄúIrvin, was very impressive. Stylishly dressed in black, his presence dominated the stage. He acted the role with such conviction that it would be impossible to doubt the malevolence of his intentions.‚Äù Continuing, they added ‚ÄúIrvin has a strong baritone with an interestingly colored timbre, which he successfully used to characterize Rance‚Äôs sinister nature. He sang with confidence, coated with a vocal swagger that gave him the necessary authority to convince in the role.‚Äù Also at the Wexford Festival, Irvin performed Dan Packard in Dinner at Eight. Irvin was honored with the Heinz Rehfuss Singing Actor Award by the Orlando Opera. Irvin was also recognized with an Honorable Mention in the Fourth Annual Excellence in Opera awards by Operavore. He was featured by Barihunks for his Zurga in the 2015 production at Utah Opera of Bizet's The Pearl Fishers, and in 2017 for his role at Minnesota Opera in Dinner at Eight. == Discography == * An American Baritone Vincero Enterprises (2011) * Then Sings my Soul (2019) == References == == External links == * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American operatic baritones Category:Simpson College alumni Category:University of Tennessee alumni ","title":"Craig Irvin"},{"id":"63906032","text":"Vladim√≠r Hirsch (born July 3, 1954, Bene≈°ov, Czech Republic) is a Czech composer and instrumentalist (keyboard instruments). The author of the concept of the so-called \\"integrated\\" musical form ‚Äì combining contemporary classical music with dark-ambient and industrial music, his compositional style is characterized by polymodal architecture and alchemical work with sound, using mainly digital techniques to expand the action potential of the means of expression. Vladim√≠r Hirsch is or was the leader of the avant-garde projects Aghiatrias, Skrol, Zygote, Subpop Squeeze, and more. From 1986 to 1996, he was a member of the experimental post-punk band Der Marabu. Vladim√≠r Hirsch graduated from the Faculty of Medicine at Charles University in Prague and has been practicing medicine with shorter or longer breaks. ==Biography and style== Vladim√≠r Hirsch was born in Bene≈°ov, lived in Ledeƒç nad S√°zavou until he was 18 and then moved to Prague, where he now lives and works. Composing since 1973, he started with small romantic and classical compositions for piano and organ, but very soon abandoned the experiments and devoted himself only to rock and jazz. A long-time member of the Prague-based post-punk group Der Marabu, after its disintegration, he founded the ensemble Skrol (1995) and several other parallel projects like Aghiatrias, Zygote, Subpop Squeeze, Luminar Ax, etc. Without ever abandoning his projects and ensembles, in 1987 the composer began working in parallel on solo production, and around 2002 it became his main program. Emphasizing the use of modern means of expression and the search for specific compositional techniques, he bring together serial, atonal, microtonal, polymodal, and spectral music. Partly inspired by the traditions of 20th-century Slavic classical music, Vladim√≠r Hirsch keeps building hybrid working models in tonal principles, composition, and instrumentation. Using digital techniques for classical orchestras together with a wide range of sound sources, he searches to achieve the alchemical transformation of sounds into a homogeneous, indivisible substance. This principle, called \\"integrated music\\"Claudia Admiron: Invocatio (rozhovor pro \\"Heathen Harvest\\", 2013) by itself, also represents the metaphysical idea of the creative concept, which consists in the collision and reconciliation of two seemingly opposite spiritual worlds within an individual. Vladim√≠r Hirsch regularly gives concerts both at home and abroad, including tours in the USA, Germany, Great Britain and Italy. In 2010, an eight-disc set of key recordings was released by the Italian publishing house Ars Benevola Mater entitled \\"The Assent to Paradoxon\\". He has also collaborated with foreign artists on different projects like Dawn Carlyle aka Dove Hermosa, Nadya Feir, Cecilia Bj√§rg√∂, Igor Vaganov, Alessandro Aru, and Kenji Siratori. ==Creations== Vladim√≠r Hirsch's music lingers between experimental projects and compositions of a very strict compositional order, but is almost always of a conceptual nature: > \\"It is the work of a non-conformist individualist, forging a completely > original aesthetic form, where the unifying element is a rather dark, > emotionally tense, often apocalyptic atmosphere of compositions, > characterized by their metaphysical, existential anxiety, and spirituality.\\" > (Stephen Ellis)Stephen Ellis: Vladim√≠r Hirsch - Symphony No.4 \\"Descent from > the Cross\\" His most notable works include \\"Symphony No. 4\\" with the subtitle \\"Sn√≠m√°n√≠ z k≈ô√≠≈æe\\" (in English: \\"Shooting from the Cross\\")Adam X: Vladim√≠r Hirsch - Symfonie ƒç. 4: Descent From The Cross (Engl.); Heathen Harvest and its revised, live version \\"Graue Passion\\" (≈†ed√© pa≈°ije);M.Jarol√≠m: Graue Passion recenze the conceptual dark ambient albums \\"Underlying Scapes\\", \\"Exorcisms\\", \\"Invocations\\" and \\"Scripta Soli\\"Full Moon Magazin / Richard Kutƒõj: Do posledn√≠ho p≈ô√≠sn√©ho detailu; the extensive ingressive composition \\"Contemplatio per nexus\\"; the post-industrial mass \\"Missa Armata\\"; the composition for piano, percussion and combined electroacoustic techniques \\"Endoanathymia\\"; the digital symphony \\"Axonal Transit\\"; the microtonal dark ambient album\\" Epidemic Mind\\"; the selection of compositions for organ and piano \\"Selected Organ and Piano Works\\", and Concerto for Organ No. 2 \\"Horae\\". While the composer's work seems to be permeated by a very elaborate and authentic expression of the internal conflict of values within the individual and one's confrontation with the anthropocentric model of contemporary society, the composer disagrees it was the initial idea in throughout the compositions. For the insiders of the industrial and post-industrial scene, Vladim√≠r Hirsch produces very intense, full of suggestive and stormy atmosphere music.Blanick√Ω J., Auster M.: Vladim√≠r Hirsch - Biografie Vlad√≠mir Hirsch was included in Olivier Bernard's Anthology of Ambient Music, Olivier Bernard: Anthology of Ambient (Anthologie de l'ambient - in French The Complete Guide of Ambient MusicThe Complete Guide of Ambient Music, p. 247, Pedia Press and in the encyclopedic publication of composers of contemporary world music.21st Century composers /(Life Journey, 2013) ==Selected compositions== Hirsch's work is represented by the activities of his ensembles and also by an extensive collection of solo works.

It was organised by the National League of the Blind (NLB) to protest poor working conditions and poverty experienced by blind people. In particular the NLB raised concerns over the conditions in workshops run to provide employment to the visually impaired by various charities. The marchers assembled at Newport, Manchester and Leeds on 5 April and marched to London, assembling at Trafalgar Square on 25 April. They were greeted by a crowd of 10,000 who listened to speeches from Herbert Morrison and trade union leaders. The march leaders met with prime minister David Lloyd George on 30 April, who made few promises apart from to pay for the marchers' rail tickets home. A subsequent Blind Persons Act 1920, the first disability-specific legislation in the world, compelled local authorities to ensure the welfare of blind persons and reduced the pension age for blind men. The march served as inspiration for the more famous 1936 Jarrow March against unemployment, in which the NLB also participated. == Background == Depiction of a column of blinded soldiers, Manchester A trade union and pressure group, the National League of the Blind (NLB), was founded in 1889 by Ben Purse to campaign for the rights of visually impaired persons. At this time many blind people were reliant on low paid work in charity factories under poor conditions. The charities were often controlling over their employees including restricting if they could marry. It was also alleged that too much of the charities' funds was spent on sighted employees. The NLB had little success in furthering the welfare of blind people in the years preceding the First World War, though it held its first strike in Bristol in 1912. After the First World War, in the course of which many servicemen were blinded by poison gas or shells, many blind people were living in poor conditions. The NLB estimated that 20,000 out of the 35,000 blind people in the United Kingdom were in poverty. The NLB held a large meeting at Trafalgar Square in 1918 and disrupted a session of the House of Commons in 1919. Later that year the house failed to pass a bill proposed by Labour member of parliament Ben Tillett, the third attempt to introduce legislation to improve the welfare of blind people. The NLB responded by calling for a march to demand more rights for blind people and fairer working conditions. == March == Herbert Morrison The NLB decided that only men would be permitted to join the march as conditions on the route were expected to be poor. Additionally, though it had many members who were veterans of the British Army, it was decided that they would not march as the union did not want patriotic sympathy to be cited as the reason for its success. The marchers would be ill-equipped, carrying only their white canes and with no change of clothes or provisions. This may have been a deliberate move by the NLB to portray the marchers as vulnerable and disprove the popular perception that the charities were looking after them well. The march was led by Purse, David Lawley (the NLB North West organiser) and Patrick Neary (the Dublin branch secretary). The march began on Easter Monday, 5 April 1920 from Newport, Manchester and Leeds. The 37 Newport marchers were drawn from South West England, the 60 assembled at Manchester came from Ireland and North West England and the 74 at Leeds from Scotland and North East England. The Newport group marched via Abergavenny and Worcester, meeting the Manchester group, who had marched through Stafford and Wolverhampton, at Birmingham. The combined group then marched to Leicester to meet with the Leeds marchers who had travelled via Sheffield and Nottingham. After joining at Leicester on 15 April the group marched through Market Harborough to reach Northampton and Wellingborough on 17 April and Luton on 20 April. They had grown to 250 in number by the time the march arrived at London's Trafalgar Square on 25 April, where they were greeted by a crowd of 10,000 people. The marchers carried banners reading \\"social justice not charity\\" and were accompanied by music played on drums, toy trumpets and mouth organs. The men marched arm in arm and four abreast or else held onto a rope to avoid getting separated. Sighted guides marched with them and directed the men by means of whistles or shouted signals. In some municipalities the local police provided an escort for the marchers, others put on buses to transport the men. The marchers took a train between Stone and Stafford due to poor weather. The men found accommodation on the route, provided by trade unions and cooperative societies and in some instances, were allowed to sleep in police cells. Some towns and cities provided a formal reception for the march with ceremonies attended by local dignitaries and with music from brass bands. In Trafalgar Square Labour Party politician Herbert Morrison and union leaders addressed the crowd whilst the marchers stood on the steps of the National Gallery. == Aftermath == Some of the 1936 Jarrow March participants The marchers requested a meeting with the prime minister, David Lloyd George, which they claimed he had promised them in July 1919. Lloyd George initially declined to meet them, offering the Lord Privy Seal and his effective deputy Bonar Law. The marchers refused this offer and said they would remain in London until they could meet with Lloyd George. While they waited they were invited to take tea at the House of Commons with Lady Astor. Lloyd George eventually relented and met, on 30 April, with Lawley, Neary, Purse and Charles Lothian. The prime minister claimed that his budget was limited, due to the costs of the war, and he could not meet their demands of better education, more work opportunities and a financial grant to all blind persons. The government would instead progress the Blind Persons Act and pay for rail tickets for the marchers to return home. Though similar legislation had been debated before the march; both the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and historian Francis Salt writing in 2017 say the new act was a direct result of the 1920 NLB protest. Though the march did not achieve all of its aims it has been described by the BBC as \\"a milestone in the history of the disability rights movement\\". The Blind Persons Act 1920 was the first disability-specific legislation anywhere in the world. The act required local authorities to \\"promote the welfare of blind persons\\" and reduced the pension age for blind men from 70 to 50. The NLB feared that the act would simply allow local authorities to sub-contract their responsibilities to the charities that they opposed. The NLB later passed a motion of dissatisfaction in the government's response to the march. Purse changed his views and became more favourable to the charities, this was not compatible with the NLB's position and he left the organisation in 1920, founding the National Union of the Industrial and Professional Blind (which continues, as of 2020, as the National Federation of the Blind advocacy group). The march helped inspire the more famous, but less successful, 1936 Jarrow March against unemployment. The NLB joined the 1936 Jarrow March to highlight the plight of unemployment among blind people which had reached 35,000 out of 40,000 during the Great Depression. The NLB merged with the Iron and Steel Trade Confederation in 2000 and is now part of the trade union Community. The RNIB marked the centenary of the march in April 2020. Though their plans were curtailed because of the COVID-19 pandemic the RNIB urged people to use their daily permitted exercise during the virus control lockdown to take steps significant to them and record it on social media. == References == Category:1920 in England Category:Protests in England Category:Poverty in England Category:April 1920 events Category:Protest marches Category:British trade unions history Category:Labour disputes in England Category:Disability in the United Kingdom Category:1920s protests ","title":"1920 blind march"},{"id":"63906071","text":"Kulinism (Bengali: ‡¶ï‡ßå‡¶≤‡¶ø‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø) are Hindu caste and marriage rules reputedly introduced by Raja Ballala Sena of Bengal.Kulinism Hindu Caste Rules https://www.britannica.com/topic/Kulinism The name derives from the Sanskrit word ‡§ï‡•Å‡§≤‡•Ä‡§® (kulina).

The website is named after Amazon although it more closely resembles Craigslist and eBay. The website allows users to discover other players selling a specific in-game item and buy the item for a set price, or make an offer. In addition to in-game items such as furniture, fruit and clothing, the website accommodates for trading \\"villagers\\" (in-game inhabitants), which compromise a large part of Animal Crossing's gameplay. The name \\"Nookazon\\" is a portmanteau of Tom Nook, one of New Horizonss main characters, and Amazon. == Development == Nookazon was founded on April 9, 2020. The website was created and is run by Daniel Luu, a 25-year old software developer also known by the username squishguin on internet platforms. Luu created the website as a result of his frustrations with the current trading systems. He joined the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Discord server, and found a trading message thread there, but was overwhelmed with the quantity of traders and the unorganized nature of the platform. He decided to make a website to solve this problem, with the help of two of his friends. In an interview with SquadState.com, he stated: === Cataloguing === One of the challenges Luu faced when creating Nookazon involved categorizing the many items of furniture and clothing within Animal Crossing. Animal Crossing: New Horizons contains thousands of individual items, all of which had to be catalogued with various colours in order to be listed on the website. To solve this problem, Luu used a \\"spreadsheet community\\" in order to create a comprehensive catalogue for all the game's items. He said that \\"The spreadsheet community is just a small Discord server that was putting together a spreadsheet that had all the Animal Crossing items in it, including pictures and names and variations and things like that.\\" This allowed him to easily account for all of the game's items. The spreadsheet is organised on Google Docs (found here).alt= === Popularity === The website went live on the 9th of April 2020. However, the website received a huge surge in popularity after Luu posted a 15-second TikTok demonstrating how to use the website. After that, internet traffic on the website surged from 6,000 to 180,000 overnight. The website grew beyond the scope of the Animal Crossing Discord, and eventually became an important part of the community, facilitating many trades per day. Daniel Luu stated, about the surge in popularity and the difficulties he faced with it, that: == Current release == Nookazon is split into two main areas; one is the Nookazon website, which is constructed entirely from scratch; the other, the Nookazon Discord server, is built using Discord channels and bots. The Nookazon website is managed by Daniel Luu and two of his friends. The Nookazon Discord, which now has around 600,000 members, has thirty volunteer moderators and is managed by Daniel Luu's friend Brandon. There is also a social media team, compromised of three people, that manages Nookazon's social media accounts, compromising of their Instagram, Twitter, TikTok and Facebook profiles, as well as announcements about the website. The website has 270,000 daily unique users and reaches seven million page views a day. Daniel Luu has taken development of the site full time. He stated that \\"I‚Äôve cut out a lot of hobbies, like watching YouTube, and spend most of my free time on the site. I don‚Äôt mind though, because I love working on it, and I would probably be making another app or website if it wasn‚Äôt Nookazon.\\" In October 2020, Nookazon held \\"Spookazon\\" events, various competitions based around Halloween. == Trading == The various item categories of Nookazon The website does not carry out the trade itself; it shows a catalogue of items, that in turn display potential sellers. In this respect, it functions more like the online marketplace eBay. The trade is then carried out in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The website forbids the use of real-life currency; it instead is built off of Animal Crossing: New Horizonss currency of \\"Bells\\" . The majority of the website's trading is done either on the website itself or on the accompanying Discord server. The website has a comprehensive listing of all the items in the game, created by use of spreadsheets provided by the community. The website has more than nine million item listings. The most popular items on the site are Nook Miles Tickets, followed by the cutting board, ironwood dresser, crescent-moon chair and fish bait. === Trading ===  Selling  Selling an item begins with a listing on the item. Sellers create listings, and specify if they want it to be sold in Bells or Nook Miles Tickets, or both, and specify if they want to ask for offers from buyers, or if they want to limit the buyers to the listing price. Sellers can also specify if they are open to a trade via wishlist items. The listing then appears on a list of listings, organized by default as most recent first. Alternatively, the seller can put an item up for auction. The seller is notified if a deal is accepted. If they want to, the seller can propose a counter offer at a lower or higher price, and the buyer can then do the same.  Buying  Buying an item begins by finding the item on the website. From here, the item displays buyer listings, which are offers for an item for a specific price. This can be cross-referenced with the average price graph to ensure the buyer is getting a fair trade. The Buyer will suggest a price, which will then be accepted by the Buyer, or counter offered. Once the offer is accepted, the trade takes place in game.  The In-Game Trade  Once a deal is accepted, the trade is carried out in Animal Crossing, via a specific code called a Dodo code that allows a player to visit a specific island. Both players drop their trade on the ground; money can be dropped, as well as Nook Miles Tickets. For more expensive trades, like Villagers, a trade facilitator can be requested on Nookazon's Discord. The trade facilitator will be one of around thirty approved trade facilitators. After the trade, buyers and sellers can leave reviews from one to five star with a comment to inform other users about the trader. This allows Nookazon to manage the level of scam traders on the site. If a trade went badly, the player can \\"flag\\" another user. While this does not ban them, this warns other users that they are not entirely trustworthy. === Economy === In order to keep prices fair, Nookazon has introduced different forms of currency in order to keep a stable economy. One example of this is the introduction of paying with Nook Miles Tickets, highly valued Animal Crossing items. Whereas the value of Bells has gradually decreased over time, the price of Nook Miles Tickets has stayed consistent. As such, Nookazon's economy has two forms of currency; the highly fluctuating bell economy, and the stable Nook Miles Ticket economy. When asked about the fluctuating price of certain popular items in the game, Daniel Luu stated \\"One thing [Nookazon] has definitely taught me is that people will go crazy over certain items. People just love to have their dream islands come true. Even though sometimes the Discord link on the website doesn‚Äôt work, people are still figuring out a way to go out and contact people in order to make these trades. It just really shows that there‚Äôs a need for this marketplace to be safe and easy to use. Those are the things that we really are focusing on moving forward with the platform.\\" == Criticism == === Black Lives Matter controversy === Following the George Floyd protests which began in May 2020, users of Nookazon criticized the website's leaders and moderators for banning Discord members who posted in support of Black Lives Matter. Nookazon leadership later clarified that they support the protests, pledging to donate $500 towards the cause. They stated that users could opt-in to a \\"current events\\" channel where this discussion could take place. This channel was edited to be a non-interactive \\"global resources\\" channel with links to protest information. === Safe trading and inflated pricing === Nookazon has been used by scammers to make users buy overpriced items. To combat this, Nookazon introduced an \\"average price\\" graph which showed the average price of the item over time to ensure that users do not buy overpriced items. In addition, a \\"Safe Trading Guide\\" is available to all users that outlines various method in which scammers attempt to cheat on buyers and sellers and how to prevent them. For high value items, users have inflated the price ten-fold, in order to gain the most money possible. One significant instance of this is with villagers, specifically Raymond, a villager new to Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Prices have been inflated into the tens of millions. The high demand for these characters perpetuates the inflation. This occurs with rare furniture items too, with a poster being in the millions. Many have critcised the villager trading system, accusing Nookazon as being in \\"the darkest corners of the internet\\". Seasonal materials are also susceptible to large fluctuations in price, with an auction for 100 cherry blossom petals selling at a total of 2.8 million bells. == Future == According to Luu, a smartphone app is \\"definitely a consideration for the future\\", although Luu has stated that it \\"will not be a thing for some time\\", and that he wants to \\"focus (his) time on making the website experience as smooth as possible.\\" A Nookazon app was teased to be in development on September 23rd 2020. Nookazon's popularity is attributed partly to the 2020 lockdown and the unprecedented success of Animal Crossing. When asked about how long Nookazon will keep going for, Daniel Luu said \\"I don‚Äôt think I would have ever gotten this experience without having Nookazon blow up like it did... I think the Animal Crossing community has been so great to us, our entire team, and it‚Äôs such a fun project to work on, so I think even after the quarantine, even after a while, we will continue to support Nookazon. I think it‚Äôs such a great place for people to connect. Some of the things that people have made are amazing. I think the energy of the community is going to keep us going, for sure.\\" == References == == External links == * Category:E-commerce Category:Gaming websites Category:Internet properties established in 2020 Category:Video game fansites Category:Video game websites Category:Animal Crossing ","title":"Nookazon"},{"id":"63906132","text":"Hulda Adhiambo, known professionally as Serro, is a Kenyan singer, songwriter and performer of benga, afro-pop and jazz style, known for her hit singles, \\"Rongai\\" and \\"Kasyoki Wa Mitumba\\".

He worked on many public commissions, and his sculptures are in the collections of museums and galleries around the world. In 1979 he was awarded a gold medal by the Accademia Italia delle Arti del Lavoro. His only child is the noted artist, Frank Varga. == Background == Varga showed artistic talent at a young age. Encouraged by his parents, he started painting at age ten. Due to his talent, he enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts where he studied under Jen≈ë Bory and Ferenc Sidl√≥. After graduating from college, he was a teaching assistant under Bory and taught from 1928 until 1940. Varga's initial success as a sculptor came in 1926. He won the Grand Prize at a nationwide art exhibition with a marble statue entitled \\"Eva\\". He was then commissioned to create the World War I memorial in Piszke. Archduke Joseph August of Austria attended its unveiling on November 2, 1930. In 1928 he received an award from Lord Rothermere which he used to study sculpture in Italy. While in Italy, the Italian government purchased some of his statues. After his return home, he worked with Cistercian teacher Elem√©r Schwartz and started a series of religious statues for Hungarian churches as part of the \\"Betlehemes Mozgalom\\" (English: Nativity Movement). He was commissioned to create other World War I monuments in Kiskunf√©legyh√°za and Satu Mare. His 1939 sculpture entitled \\"St. Stephen and His Disciple\\" can still be seen in the Cistercian Grammar School in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, and he made a sculpture of St. Imre that resides in Gy≈ër. In 1940 he won the Ball√≥ Scholarship, won the first prize of the G√°bor √Åron sculpture competition, and was elected to the St. Istvan Academy Of Arts, Letters and Sciences. He emigrated from Hungary in 1948, first living in Belgium, then in Canada. In 1951, Varga's family joined him in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, where he had established a studio. From Windsor, the family moved across the river to Detroit. In Detroit, he worked on many public commissions although at first he had a hard time restarting his fine arts career. In 1970, he moved his studio to Florida, where he continued to work and teach. In 1979 he was awarded a gold medal by the Accademia Italia delle Arti del Lavoro. Varga's works are in private collections, public commissions, and commissions for religious, private institutions, museums and galleries. In 1977, Varga was featured in the National Sculpture Review as part of its issue highlighting foreign-born artists. Varga mentored other artists, like Ruth Hutton Ancker. == Selected works == thumb Varga's works have been collected by the Hungarian National Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Hungarian National Gallery, as well as the Vatican, Italian, Swiss and Belgian museums.

Below-freezing temperatures and snow are common in the winter months. ==Geography== The ecoregion covers higher elevations in several disconnected ranges in southern and central Spain. The Sierra Nevada lies in Andalucia, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. The Sierra de Baza lies close to the northeast. The Sierra de Castril lies northeast of the Sierra de Baza, between the Andalucian and Iberian mountains. The ecoregion covers the southern ranges of the Sistema Ib√©rico, including the Sierra de G√∫dar, Sierra de Albarrac√≠n, and Sierra de Javalambre. It also includes the Sierra de Guadarrama, the eastern portion of the Sistema Central. ==Flora== Pine forests are the characteristic plant community, with Black pine (Pinus nigra salzmannii), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), and Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) predominant. Mixed forests of pines and broadleaf trees grow at middle to lower elevations in areas with deeper soils and higher humidity. Broadleaf trees include Quercus faginea, Quercus pyrenaica, Ulmus glabra, Fraxinus angustifolia, lindens (Tilia spp.), Sorbus spp., and maples (Acer spp). Taxus baccata, Tilia platyphyllos, and Populus tremula grow in sheltered canyons with year-round moisture. Evergreen oaks, chiefly holm oak (Quercus ilex subsp. ballota) grow on dry and south-facing slopes at low and mid-elevations. ==Fauna== Spanish red deer (Cervus elaphus hispanicus) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) are widespread. The Western Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica victoriae), a threatened subspecies of goat, was reintroduced to Sierra de Guadarrama National Park in 1991 from the Gredos Mountains further west, and has increased in numbers since.Refoyo, Pablo, Cristina Olmedo, Ignacio Polo, Paulino Fandos and Benito Mu√±oz (2015). \\"Demographic trends of a reintroduced Iberian ibex Capra pyrenaica victoriae population in central Spain\\".

Completed in 1825, the arcade has around 30 shops. It was renovated between 2010 and 2014, after being on the Heritage at risk register. The arcade is a Grade II* listed building. ==History== Pelham Arcade in 1910 Pelham Arcade was built between 1823 and 1825 by Joseph Kay, at 1-12 Pelham Crescent in Hastings, East Sussex. It is believed to be one of the UK's oldest shopping arcades. Pelham Arcade was intended to mimic the style of Burlington Arcade in London, in particular, the use of arches between shops. Pelham Arcade and Pelham Crescent are named after Thomas Pelham, 2nd Earl of Chichester, who built terraced houses in the area in the early 19th century, and owned Hastings Castle. In the nineteenth century, the arcade contained around 30 shops, including coffee shops, cigar shops, a library, French china shops, jewellery shops and shops selling foreign wines. The arcade also contained assembly rooms, and had evening performances for one shilling. In the summer, musical shows were performed on the promenade outside the arcade. In 1857, a Russian gun captured during the Crimean War was displayed on the seafront near Pelham Arcade. In the 1930s, the gun was moved to the Hastings Museum and Art Gallery. In the 20th and early 21st century, Pelham Arcade became run down, and suffered from damp and structural problems. In 1988, it became a Grade II listed building. Pelham Arcade was also listed on the Heritage at risk register. In 2011, the arcade was upgraded from Grade II to Grade II* listed building status. Between 2010 and 2014, Pelham Arcade was renovated, with new shop fronts and arches in the original style, and fixes to the roof in order to stop it from leaking. In 2014, the arcade was removed from the Heritage at risk register, to represent the fact that the arcade was no longer in decline. ==References== ==External links== * Historic England Category:Grade II* listed buildings in East Sussex Category:Shopping arcades in England Category:Hastings Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1825 ","title":"Pelham Arcade"},{"id":"63906462","text":"1776 Unites is a project led by African American historians, academics, and advocates to promote founding American values like entrepreneurship, self- determination, and mutual social support. 1776 Unites is supported by Robert Woodson, President and founder of the Woodson Center; academics including Carol M. Swain, Glenn Loury, Jason D. Hill, Wilfred Reilly, Shelby Steele, John McWhorter, and John Sibley Butler; and other contributors including journalists Coleman Hughes and Clarence Page. They will present stories of upward mobility and resilience that document the successes of African Americans. == The project's message == In addition to material on U.S. history and historical controversies, contributors to 1776 Unites promote current and historical examples of prosperous Black communities as ‚Äúa powerful refutation of the claim that the destiny of Black Americans is determined by what whites do, or what they have done in the past.‚Äù 1776 Unites also promotes the work and thought of entrepreneurs, philanthropists, business and community leaders, and others it considers ‚Äúachievers,‚Äù to illustrate the opportunities for success that are open to African Americans today, their contributions to national economic and cultural life, and their stake in U.S. life and history. Robert Woodson said his central motivation in founding 1776 Unites was to counter the \\"lethal\\" narratives he claimed were embedded in the 1619 Project, developed by the NY Times, which postulates that the founding of America in a structural and economic sense occurred not in 1776, the year of its declared independence, but rather in 1619 when the first slaves arrived. He called the 1619 Project's thesis ‚Äúone of the most diabolical, self-destructive ideas that I‚Äôve ever heard\\", and that the assumptions behind the 1619 Project are actually a form of \\"white supremacy\\". In addition to critiquing arguments that place slavery at the center of America's origins, 1776 Unites also publicizes the historical achievements of African American individuals and communities, including those who had been ‚Äúin slavery but not of slavery‚Äù and became successful business leaders after emancipation. == History of the project == 1776 Unites was publicly launched in a kickoff event at the National Press Club on February 14, 2020, featuring project contributors Glenn Loury, Coleman Hughes, Clarence Page, John Sibley Butler, Ian Rowe, Jason D. Hill, Robert Cherry, Carol M. Swain, Taleeb Starks, Wilfred Reilly, Toni Mcilwane, and Latasha Harrison Fields, along with project founder Woodson. That same day, 1776 Unites partnered with the Washington Examiner to release a series of essays critical of the 1619 Project, celebrating African-American contributions to business and education and arguing that slavery and its ugly legacy should not be seen as definitive of the black experience. In September 2020, 1776 Unites announced a curriculum that will offer life lessons from largely unknown African-American figures from the past who have triumphed over adverse conditions. ==References== ==External links== * Woodson Center * 1776 Unites * 1776: A Celebration of America Category:Slavery in the United States Category:The New York Times Category:2020 introductions Category:1776 in the Thirteen Colonies Category:Black conservatism in the United States ","title":"1776 Unites"},{"id":"63906466","text":"Mozammel Haque is a National Awami Party (Muzaffar) politician and the former Member of Parliament of Brahmanbaria-1. ==Career== Haque was elected to parliament from Brahmanbaria-1 as a National Awami Party (Muzaffar) candidate in 1986 and 1988. ==References== Category:National Awami Party (Muzaffar) politicians Category:Living people Category:3rd Jatiya Sangsad members Category:4th Jatiya Sangsad members Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Mozammel Haque (NAP (Muzzafar) politician)"},{"id":"63906502","text":"Doris Martha Weber (1898 Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin ‚Äì 1984, Hinckley, Ohio) was an American photographer.

The film in part was designed to market the additive two-colour film process originally developed by Claude's father William Friese-Greene, and then improved by Claude as the \\"new all British Friese-Green natural colour process\\". The process renders colour by passing the light through a pair of red or blue-green filters, and then onto standard black-and-white film, alternating the filters every frame. When played back, the same alternating coloured filters are used to project in colour. It features various famous British locations: Land's End, Cornwall, St Michael's Mount, St Ives, Torquay, Glasgow, Stirling, Oban, etc. Though it had some interest when previewed in 1925, it did not attain great success due to problems inherent to the colour processing, which produced colour fringing and flicker. The original film was digitally restored in 2005 by the BFI, who have the original negatives on file. The footage in the archive was compiled into a 65-minute film from the original 26 parts, and was made available to watch within the UK online free of charge.

President Rodrigo Duterte presides over a meeting with the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Malaca√±ang Palace on March 12. === Measures === Following the confirmation of the first localized transmission on March 7, the DOH raised its alert to Code Red Sub-Level 1. President Rodrigo Duterte later issued Proclamation No. 922 on March 9, formally declaring a public health emergency, authorizing local government units to employ their local disaster risk reduction management funds. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on March 9 issued a directive ordering retailers should only allow the sale of two bottles of each type of disinfectant per person as a measure against hoarding. In line with the public health emergency declaration, the department imposed a 60-day price freeze on basic commodities. On March 16, the president signed Proclamation No. 929 declaring a state of calamity throughout the country for six months, bringing into effect the following: * price control of basic needs and commodities, * granting interest-free loans, * distribution of calamity funds, * authorization of importation and receipt of donations, and * hazard allowance for public health workers and government personnel in the fields of science and technology. President Duterte has signed administrative orders providing daily hazard pay and additional special risk allowance to front line government officials and employees including health workers. The office of Vice President Leni Robredo on its part raised funding for personal protective equipments. The Department of Labor and Employment and the Department of Social Welfare and Development has started their own emergency cash subsidy programs. === Bayanihan to Heal as One Act === Senators during a special session to tackle the passage of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act on March 23. Following the sharp increase of confirmed cases, President Duterte called on Congress to hold special sessions on March 23 to enact the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act upon his request, which would \\"authorize the President to exercise powers necessary to carry out urgent measures to meet the current national emergency related to COVID-19 only for three months unless extended by Congress.\\" The act would allow President Duterte to \\"reallocate, realign, and reprogram\\" a budget of almost ($5.37 billion) from the estimated ($8.55 billion) national budget approved for 2020, in response to the pandemic; enable him to \\"temporarily take over or direct the operations\\" of public utilities and privately owned health facilities and other necessary facilities \\"when the public interest so requires\\" for quarantine, the accommodation of health professionals, and the distribution and storage of medical relief; and \\"facilitate and streamline\\" the accreditation of testing kits. In the House of Representatives of the Philippines, the bill was introduced as House Bill No. 6616 with House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano of Pateros‚ÄìTaguig as its principal sponsor and was defended on the floor by Deputy Speaker Luis Raymund Villafuerte of Camarines Sur's 2nd district. Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea addressed the session, stressing that the president needed \\"standby powers\\" to address the emergency. Some representatives questioned the nature, usage, and necessity of the \\"standby powers\\", claiming its susceptibility to abuse and corruption. In the Senate of the Philippines, the bill was introduced as Senate Bill No. 1418 with Senate President Tito Sotto and Senator Pia Cayetano as its principal sponsors. Under the bill, Senator Cayetano said that over 18 million Filipino households living below the poverty line would also receive financial incentives of around ‚Äì8,000 ($97.45‚Äì155.92) per month for two months. Senators amended their version of the bill to include financial compensation of around ($1,965.33) to be given by PhilHealth to health professionals who contracted the virus, as well as the provision of around -worth ($19,653.27) of financial aid to their families. Both versions of the bill reportedly removed the usage of the term \\"emergency powers\\", replacing it with \\"authority\\". It also removed the term \\"take over of public utilities and private businesses\\", limiting President Duterte's abilities at most to \\"direct the operations\\" of such enterprises. The House version of the bill passed the House of Representatives in a 284‚Äì9 vote without abstentions, while its Senate version unanimously passed the Senate. President Duterte signed the bill into law the following day. === Lockdowns === On March 12, President Duterte announced a partial lockdown covering Metro Manila, that began on March 15. The lockdown was later expanded on March 16, when President Duterte imposed an enhanced community quarantine covering the entire Luzon, including outlying islands. The enhanced community quarantine restricted travel and transportation within the island, imposed strict home quarantine among all households, and the closure of all non-essential private establishments. On April 7, President Duterte extended the duration of the enhanced community quarantine on Luzon until April 30, following a recommendation from the IATF-EID. On April 24, Duterte extended the enhanced community quarantine until May 15, but only for Metro Manila, Central Luzon and Calabarzon as well as other areas in Luzon that are considered a high-risk for COVID-19.

The agency targets to make 18 million low-income households as beneficiaries of the program. Households with a family income of less than monthly income was given priority. The DSWD has devolved the distribution of the cash subsidy to the LGUS though the agency continues to provide support to the LGUs' efforts including \\"on-the-spot\\" validation of beneficiaries. By May 17, the DSWD already reach 95 percent of its target, providing aid to 17.1 million beneficiary households with worth of cash subsidy distributed. The DSWD has also advised multiple times against the proliferation of unsanctioned Facebook Pages about its Social Amelioration Program. For the second tranche of the SAP, the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte changed the responsibility of distributing cash aid from the local government units to the military and police amidst complains of slow delivery and misuse of funds meant for certain areas.  Universal healthcare  The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) announced that it would provide ($581-million) worth of advance payment to its accredited health facilities for health care providers to obtain the liquid capital required to efficiently respond to the crisis. PhilHealth also subsided some of its policies on its members; it waived the 45-day coverage and single period of confinement policies while extending payment deadlines until the end of April and the failing period of claims from 60 days to at least 120 days. Also, PhilHealth announced that PUIs quarantined in its accredited facilities are entitled to a ($270) health package, while those who tested positive for COVID-19 are entitled to a ($580) beneficiary package.  Frontline workers compensation  On March 23, President Duterte signed Administrative Order No. 26, granting that front line government officials and employees receive a daily hazard pay of ($9.87). On April 6, President Duterte signed Administrative Order No. 28, granting the payment of a special risk allowance to public health workers in addition to their hazard pay.

Other measures  The Presidential Security Group (PSG) have implemented a \\"no-touch\\" policy during meetings by President Duterte with politicians, reporters, and visitors. Several government officials announced that they would donate portions of their salaries to help fund government initiatives responding to the pandemic. President Duterte said that he would donate a month of his salary, which amounts to , to the Office of Civil Defense. Some senators and around 200 members of the House of Representatives would also donate their salaries for May, while most Cabinet members would donate at most 75 percent of their salaries. The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) announced it would initiate a cash assistance program worth ($39 million) for workers in both the formal and informal sectors across the country affected by government-imposed quarantines. As of March 31, the department reported that at least 25,428 formal sectors and 5,220 informal sector workers were given cash assistance of ($98) each. === Medical supply === The office of Vice President Leni Robredo raised about ($564,551) to purchase 64,367 sets of PPE and donate it to front line health professionals across the country. The first batch consisted of 7,350 PPEs that were donated to 490 professionals in eight hospitals in Manila and Quezon City with COVID-19 cases. By March 24, Robredo's office had delivered 23,475 sets of PPE to 62 medical facilities and communities across Metro Manila, La Union, and Quezon. Robredo also partnered with fashion designer Mich Dulce to mass-produce PPEs that utilize locally sourced Taffeta fabric; the Vice President pledged to help donate the PPEs to medical professionals across the country. === Mass testing === A COVID-19 swabbing center at Palacio de Maynila. As part of the national government's efforts to conduct mass testing, it began setting up \\"mega swabbing centers\\" in May 2020 by re-purposing various existing facilities. The first of such facility opened at the Palacio de Manila along Roxas Boulevard on May 5. These facilities uses reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kits. The facilities are meant to prioritize the testing of around 25,000 Overseas Filipino Worker repatriates. Two more facilities opened: at the Enderun Colleges in Taguig and the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay A fourth facility is set to be opened at the Philippine Arena which will test residents of Bulacan and Metro Manila. All swab samples collected from the testing centers will be processed by the Philippine Red Cross. As of September 2020, the Philippine Government has reported that over 3 million people have been tested.https://bcda.gov.ph/ph- surpasses-3-million-covid-19-tests === Travel restrictions === Thermal scanning at Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. Ruffy Biazon, a member of the House of Representatives from Muntinlupa, called on the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) on January 22 to suspend flights from Wuhan to the Philippines. Royal Air Charter Service operates direct flights from Wuhan to Kalibo. By then, Philippine travel visas under the \\"visa-upon-arrival\\" (VUA) program were denied to tourists from Wuhan. On January 24, the Philippine government deported 135 individuals from Wuhan who arrived in the country through the Kalibo International Airport. There were calls for a wider temporary ban on people entering the country from anywhere in China. This was supported by Senators Ralph Recto, Bong Go, Risa Hontiveros, and Francis Pangilinan however, the DOH and the Office of the President find no urgent need for such a measure. On January 31, a travel ban on all Chinese nationals from Hubei and other affected areas in China was imposed. The VUA program for Chinese tourists and businessmen was also suspended. On February 2, a ban was introduced on all foreign travelers who visited China, Hong Kong, and Macau in the past 14 days; Philippine citizens and holders of permanent resident visas were allowed in the country but subjected to a mandatory 14-day quarantine. The Philippine government also ordered a ban on travel to China, Hong Kong, and Macau until further notice. On February 10, the ban was further extended to include Taiwan but was lifted on February 15. On February 14, the DOH announced that a risk assessment carried out to determine if Singapore would be placed under a travel ban. Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. announced that he would not fully support any official travel bans to Singapore. On February 26, travel to South Korea was banned, except for permanent residents, Filipino leaving for study, and Overseas Filipino Workers returning for work.

Grounded planes at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Pasay, Metro Manila. On March 19, Locsin announced that the Philippine government would deny the entry of all foreign nationals, effective that day \\"until further notice\\". All Philippine embassies and consulates would suspend the issuing of its visas to all foreign nationals and invalidate all existing ones. However, Locsin clarified that visas that had already been issued to families of Filipino nationals would remain valid. On March 22, the Department of Transportation ordered a travel ban to all foreign nationals, with the exception of returning or repatriated overseas Filipinos, foreign spouses of Filipino citizens (and their children), and workers for international organizations and non-governmental organizations accredited in the country. The Philippines suspended all inbound commercial flight to its international airports for a week starting May 3. From May 11 to June 10, new regulations are imposed on inbound flights to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport with charter flights allowed only on Mondays and Thursdays and commercial flights allowed in all the other five days. All flights require prior clearance from the DFA and CAAP. === Repatriation === Repatriated Filipinos disembark their plane at Clark Air Base, Pampanga on February 9. The Philippine national government has repatriated citizens from various COVID-19 affected countries and cruise ships. As of April 13, at least 13,000 Overseas Filipino Workers have been repatriated according to the DFA. Philippine Airlines, the country's flag carrier, has volunteered several repatriation flights as early as March. The first of such efforts by the government involved repatriating Filipino nationals in Hubei, China. The government began the repatriation process on January 18. Upon arrival in the Philippines, individuals underwent mandatory quarantine for 14 days. The Athlete's Village at the New Clark City Sports Hub which also has a clinic run by the Philippine General Hospital was chosen as the quarantine site for repatriated Filipinos and New Clark City was locked down on February 6 in preparation for the arrival of the repatriated.https://bcda.gov.ph/returning-ofws-undergo- quarantine-we-heal-one-center-world-trade-center === Military and police === A police-manned checkpoint in Tuguegarao Both the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) have been deployed by the national government as front liners in addressing the pandemic. PNP Chief Archie Gamboa tasked his agency to increase their visibility in various communities and to arrest individuals and groups \\"without warning\\" involved in activities that violate quarantine protocols on physical distancing and mass gatherings. Border checkpoints maintained by the AFP, PNP, and the Philippine Coast Guard were installed in areas with community quarantine to control the traffic of people and goods and ultimately contain the spread of the virus across regions during the pandemic. The PNP have also been tasked to arrest individuals who hoard essential goods in stores and to report firms that fail to comply with the directives of the DTI by manipulating the prices of such goods during the pandemic. The Philippine Air Force and Philippine Navy have utilized their aircraft and vessels for the delivery of personal protective equipment and medical supplies, as well as the transportation of health personnel, to various locations around the country. On March 24, the PNP launched a task force in collaboration with the Department of Information and Communications Technology to search for and apprehend peddlers of misinformation and fake news related to the pandemic, in compliance with the Cybercrime Prevention Act and the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. Both laws penalize fake news peddlers for a jail time of 12 years maximum or a fine of up to ($19,770). Since April 15, PNP personnel have donated portions of their salaries to the Department of Finance to help sustain the national government's efforts in addressing the pandemic. Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III reported that, as of May 6, the PNP has raised over ($4.5 million) worth of cash donations. Following the rise in violations by the public to adhere to quarantine protocols, President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened for both the military and the police to \\"take over\\" in enforcing the social distancing and curfew guidelines in a similar fashion to martial law. On April 20, a memo from the AFP regarding stricter quarantine protocols was leaked. The memo was later confirmed. Since April 20, the AFP has deployed its field kitchens in various locations around the country to provide free meals for homeless people, stranded workers and students, informal settlers, and families in \\"depressed communities\\" affected by the quarantine impositions. In July 2020, the Philippine government announced that the PNP will conduct house-to-house searches for people who might have been infected with COVID-19 and then forcibly relocate them to government-run isolation facilities, which according to Human Rights Watch, is a drug war tactic that will violate the rights of citizens. === Quarantine and isolation=== The Department of Public Works and Highways and the Bases Conversion and Development Authority has set up quarantine/isolation centers by repurposing facilities as \\"We Heal As One Centers\\". As of May 28, ten such facilities have been completed. == Local regulations== This is a list of regulations that were imposed on provinces and independent cities, restricting activities and closing facilities as a result of the pandemic.

Sotto mentioned that banning all tricycles in the city would bring more risk to the city's health situation. After he aired the views and experiences of the local government of Pasig, Sotto complied with the inclusion of tricycles in the public transportation ban. The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), through its Deputy Director Ferdinand Lavin, confirmed on April 1, 2020 that NBI sent an invitation letter to Sotto for violation of Bayanihan to Heal as One Act. Lavin said that Sotto is scheduled to appear at the bureau on April 7, 2020 at 10 am. Sotto responded by saying that he had already complied with the national government's order to stop tricycle operations prior to the implementation of the law. Senate President Tito Sotto, an uncle of the mayor, criticized the move in a tweet, stating \\"NBI will be well advised to be cautious in their interpretation of the law I principally authored. Any so- called violation of RA 11469 can't be retroactive!\\". Liberal Party president and Senator Francis Pangilinan also questioned the NBI's actions, stating the unconstitutionality of criminalizing an act committed before the law was passed. Social media responded heavily with criticism towards the NBI for allegedly singling out the mayor, even comparing the situation to that of Senator Koko Pimentel's case, who had violated quarantine protocols a few days prior at the Makati Medical Center, but was given consideration by the government.  Koko Pimentel  145px The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) spokesperson Deputy Director Ferdinand Lavin said that the bureau was also investigating Senator Aquilino Pimentel III for alleged violation of the Bayanihan Heal as One Act. Director Eric Distor of the NBI confirmed that Pimentel would also be invited to the bureau to explain. He would be summoned when his self-quarantine ended. Pimentel had undergone testing for COVID-19 and was informed that he was positive for the disease while he was at the Makati Medical Center, accompanying his pregnant wife who was scheduled to give birth. The results came out on March 25 and Pimentel was tested positive for COVID-19, making the second Senator to do so after Juan Miguel Zubiri. === Quarantine violation-related controversies and incidents === === Arrests of protesters in Quezon City === On April 1, 2020, the authorities arrested 20 protesters who flocked along Edsa in Barangay Bagong Pag-asa in Quezon City for staging a rally without a permit. About 150 protesters called to local government for aid amid the enhance community quarantine in Luzon. The NBI, however, did not comment what violations the organizers may be facing. The rally leads the authorities to disperse the protesters. The arrest was condemned by Kadamay Chairperson Bea Arellano.  Shooting of Winston Ragos  Winston Ragos was a Philippine Army veteran who served in the Battle of Marawi in 2017. He was shot dead by the police at a checkpoint while the country is under enhanced community quarantine for attempting to pull a gun. Ragos was brought to Commonwealth Hospital but was declared dead on arrival. Witnesses say he did not bring a gun and his mother claimed her son was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder following his tour of duty. On April 21, 2020, at 2:30 p.m., Police Master Sergeant Daniel Florendo, Jr. and some police trainees from the Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group were manning a control point in Maligaya Drive, Brgy. Pasong Putik, Quezon City. In a CCTV footage, Ragos approached the policemen and started shouting due to their claim of him violating quarantine protocols. The police officers asked Ragos to go home and he allegedly attempted to pull out a .38 caliber hand gun from his sling bag prompting Florendo to shoot Ragos. Florendo shot Ragos twice, causing him to stagger. Ragos stood up, before falling to the ground. Ragos was brought to Commonwealth Hospital and was declared dead at 5:57 p.m. Witnesses claimed the victim did not have a gun inside his bag. Upon checking, police found .38 caliber, I.Ds and quarantine pass. For the Philippine National Police (PNP), it was a \\"judgment call\\" for Florendo. His death during the quarantine period led to heavy criticism of the PNP. Florendo surrendered to authorities and yielded his service firearm. Senator Risa Hontiveros asked the human rights sector and the police to investigate his death and said in a Facebook post that law enforcement agencies do not have an excuse for brutality and violence towards persons with mental illness and the powerless. A hashtag named #JusticeForWinstonRagos trended online. The Quezon City government released a statement online on their stance as the Quezon City Police Department is undertaking a thorough investigation. The Makabayan bloc of the House of Representatives has condemned the shooting saying the incident ‚Äúhighlights the draconian handling‚Äù of the coronavirus crisis. Philippine Army conferred Military honors to the former soldier Corporal Winston Ragos. Philippine Army said it coordinated with Ragos's mother to extend honors to the soldier and proceed with funeral and burial arrangements at the Libingan ng mga Bayani April 26, 2020 Sunday at 12 noon. Philippine Army Honored Corporal Ragos; Be buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani  Makati scuffling incident  The scuffling incident happened in Dasmari√±as Village in Makati on April 27, 2020 involving the Spanish citizen named Javier Parra and the police. The incident occurred when Police Senior Master Sergeant Roland Von Madrona and Bantay Bayan personnel Esteban Gaan, who were patrolling at village, saw Parra's housemaid named Cherilyn Escalante watering plants outside his property's parameter without wearing a face mask. Madrona and Gaan approached the maid and told her to wear a mask; Escalante complies but Parra and his wife went outside and argued with the officers. The argument lasted six minutes and was recorded on the video. Sa bidyong ito ng Makati police, pinagmumura ng nakahubad na lalaki ang naka-unipormeng police. Ang lalaki ay kinilala si Javier Salvador, isang Kastila na residente ng Dasmari√±as Village. [...] Mahigit anim na minuto nagtalo si Salvador at Madrona habang umaawat ang misis ni Salvador. Parra also did not wear a face mask and a shirt; he prompts to humiliate and hurl at the police, according to the police. Madrona attempted to arrest him but Parra evaded and went inside the house. Parra claimed that he was told by the cop to impose a fine of P1,000 due to not wearing the mask. Madrona filed criminal charges against Parra over the incident.  Debold Sinas birthday party controversy  Despite a ban on mass gatherings amidst of enhance community quarantine, the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) personnel celebrated the birthday of their chief Maj. Gen. Debold Sinas on May 8, 2020 at Camp Bagong Diwa. His birthday celebration was met with criticism on social media. The pictures of Sinas birthday party was circulated on the internet on May 13 showing the attendees appeared to disregard the rules social distancing and mass gatherings, which were place to minimize the risk of coronavirus spread. The Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Gen. Archie Gamboa ordered an investigation over Sinas's birthday party; however Gamboa defended Sinas, saying that he \\"do not think this is a violation.\\" Responding to the criticism, Sinas issued an apology over the event, saying that he did not intend to disobey the protocols related to the enhanced community quarantine. He also added that some of the photos were manipulated. The NCRPO public information office clarified that some of the photos were taken in December 2019, and coincidentally, Sinas was wearing the same T-shirt on that day. Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Eduardo A√±o said that Sinas's birthday party \\"cannot be called a birthday party\\" but \\"that is uncalled for.\\" The president added that he needs police officers like Sinas to enforce the law in Metro Manila. On May 15, 2020, the PNP filed criminal charges against Sinas and 18 other officers who attended his birthday for violating the quarantine guidelines. PNP Chief Gamboa, however, said that, despite the controversy, Sinas may not relieved from his post. Before the event, Sinas served as the police director in Cebu City from July 2018 to October 2019 before he was appointed as National Capital Region Chief Police Officer. Despite the controversy, President Rodrigo Duterte assured Sinas that he will not resign from his post because \\"he is a good officer\\" and \\"an honest one.\\" Duterte's statement of staying Sinas at the post was met with condemnation from the human rights groups. Note: Skip to 16:43-17:13. === Social media ===  Allegations of hospital not counting COVID-19 deaths  On April 11, 2020, GMA News anchor Arnold Clavio revealed the allegations through his social media account that one hospital in Metro Manila has not counted the deaths of COVID-19. Clavio said that these information were coming from one of the frontliners he did not name and he also included the screenshots of the conversation of the frontliner. The frontliner alleged that, due to lack of body bags, the bodies were spread out in the hospital hallway. The DOH responded the allegations, clarifying that the agency has never issued any order to stop the census of COVID-19 deaths. The DOH added that they have spoken Clavio for the matter and the agency is investigating the allegations. The East Avenue Medical Center denied the claims that they are lacking body bags for the patients who died.  #OustDuterte  The hashtag #OustDuterte and #OustDuterteNow soon become trended one day after the beginning of pandemic in the Philippines. The netizens accused the government for failing to take immediate action of imposing the travel ban on all flights from China. On April 2, 2020 the hashtag was trended again on Twitter which garnered 327,000 tweets following Duterte's remarks of ordering to \\"shoot\\" the violators of COVID-19 quarantine protocol during his speech on April 1.

Calhoun sculpted by Theodore Augustus Mills Theodore Augustus Mills (1839‚Äì1916) was an American sculptor. He is known for sculpting the bust of John C. Calhoun in the United States Senate Vice Presidential Bust Collection. == Life and career == Theodore Augustus Mills was born on April 24, 1839 in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1860, Mills became a student at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, Germany. Theodore Mills was the son of the noted sculptor Clark Mills, who was renowned for his bronze equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C. Completed in 1853, it was the first equestrian statue erected in the United States, as well as the first bronze sculpture made in this country. Clark Mills established his foundry in Maryland, where he later cast Thomas Crawford's Statue of Freedom for the U.S. Capitol dome. Both Theodore and his brother, Theophilus, assisted their father in his projects, and both became sculptors in their own right. In the 1840s in South Carolina, Clark Mills developed a method of using life casts from the faces of his sitters to simplify the production of portrait busts. His 1846 bust of John C. Calhoun, purchased by the city of Charleston and at that time considered the best likeness of Calhoun, was made from such a life mask. That mask was used 40 years later by his son Theodore, who actively petitioned the Joint Committee on the Library for the commission of the Senate's official vice presidential bust of Calhoun. Theodore Mills having been born in South Carolina was in his favor, because attempts were traditionally made to choose a sculptor from each vice president's native state. Mills submitted a plaster model and earned the commission in 1895. Theodore Mills's likeness of Calhoun shows him as slightly gaunt, but there is no sign of the tuberculosis that ravaged the statesman in his last years. The face is most memorable for the deeply drilled eyes, which seem to express somber preoccupation. The resolute head, strongly symmetrical, appears almost to sit on the luxuriant roll of whiskers that lies beneath the jaw. The costume of shirt, cravat, waistcoat, and topcoat is encircled and partly overlaid by a cloak whose heavy folds lend an air of classical gravitas to the bust. Beyond the verifiable likeness and brooding quality, however, Mills adds little to suggest the powerfully conflicting characteristics of this controversial figure who played such a central role in 19th-century American history. Theodore Mills and his father also modeled a life mask of Abraham Lincoln just 60 days before the president was assassinated in 1865. That mask was eventually donated to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh by Theodore Mills, then a preparator in the museum's exhibits department. Already known for his Native American groups, the artist was hired in 1898 to create similar figures for the Pittsburgh museum. == Death and legacy == Mills died in 1916 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He has an entry in the Benezit Dictionary of Artists. Sculptures of Joseph Francis and Joseph Henry sculpted by Mills are held at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. == References == Category:1839 births Category:1916 deaths Category:American sculptors Category:Artists from Charleston, South Carolina ","title":"Theodore Augustus Mills"},{"id":"63907004","text":"Raul de Senna (born 17 June 1983) is a Brazilian equestrian.

Manu explains that the evolution of different castes among mankind occurred due to the union of two persons who did not belong to the same rung in the caste or class ladder (by birth and not wealth or status in society) relative to each other. According to Manu, marriage within the same caste, that is, between two persons who belong to the same rung in the ladder, is excellent. Manu bitterly criticises and condemns Pratiloma unions which were considered as \\"going against the hair or grain\\" and holds them responsible for the degeneration of the parties involved, subsequent to the union. However, later commentators have come to accept these marriages. Manu pronounces that the Pratiloma unions cause a confusion of the castes and lists six combinations that happen at the initial stage (ordered hierarchically from high to low), * Union of a Kshatriya man and a Brahmin woman results in a Suta * Union of a Vaishya man and a Brahmin woman results in a Magadha * Union of a Vaishya man and a Kshatriya woman results in a Vaidehaka * Union of a Shudra man and a Vaishya woman results in a Ayogava * Union of a Shudra man and a Kshatriya woman results in a Kshattri * Union of a Shudra man and a Brahmin woman results in a Chandala, the lowest of all mortals Similarly, there are six castes listed for the reverse union or Anuloma where a high born male unites with a woman of a lower standing (relative to the man). As opposed to Pratiloma, Anuloma unions are considered as \\"going with the grain\\" unions and according to Hindu scriptures, Anuloma marriages or unions though not advocated were tolerated and accepted historically.

German periodical Die Zeit (Hamburg) mentioned in 1984 that \\"Hitler must have known exactly about the Armenian case of Genocide\\" because one of his closest collaborators at the early stages of the National Socialist movement was Dr. Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter, i.e. Germany's former Vice Consul at Erzurum and later Co-Commander of a joint Turko-German Expeditionary guerilla force \\"whose awful reports on the massacre of the Armenians are preserved\\". The periodical went even one step further asserting that the skills used in the Armenian episode served as an example for Hitler's similar initiative against the Jews.Die Zeit (German weekly in Hamburg), No. 50, \\"Dossier\\", 7 December 1984.

Lochner (1887‚Äì1975) from Associated Press, and first published in 1942, whenever compared with any other version of Hitler's speech ‚Äì above all the Nuremberg-documents 798-PS, 1014 PS, and Raeder-27, as produced by a dubious witness after realising the L-3-version, too ‚Äì this version must be regarded as the one which most likely sums up and expresses what Hitler said ‚Äì for what Hitler really said in his notorious second speech was only written down simultaneously during his speech by one of his auditors: Wilhelm Canaris (1887‚Äì1945), at that time chief of the military secret service within the Third Reich\\". Dr. Kevork B. Bardakjian, an expert in Armenian studies, also argues that the L-3 document originates in the notes secretly taken by Wilhelm Canaris during the meeting of 22 August 1939: In his 1987 survey of the historiography of the Holocaust, the Canadian historian Michael Marrus wrote that \\"recent research\\" pointed towards the \\"authenticity\\" of the controversial L-3 document, but he however cautioned against scholars who used a single reference to the Armenian genocide in the speech as proving that Hitler was inspired by the example set by the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP).Marrus, Michael The Holocaust In History, Hanover: Brandeis University Press, 1987 p.20-21. Marrus wrote that however horrifying the Armenian genocide was, Hitler had a very low opinion of non-white peoples, making it unlikely that he would have seen the CUP as a role model.Marrus, Michael The Holocaust In History, Hanover: Brandeis University Press, 1987 p.21. According to Christopher Browning in 2004, American historian of the Holocaust, L-3 document, which contains the Armenian quote, is an \\"apocalyptic\\" version of Hitler's speech that day which was purposefully leaked to the British in order to gain their support to Poland. But he did use it as a source in his book about the holocaust Browning, Christopher R. The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy University of Nebraska Press, 2004. p. 437-438. German historian cites the statement as evidence that Hitler believed that crimes committed during wartime would be overlooked. According to this interpretation, Hitler planned to unleash genocide upon the outbreak of war: \\"war would serve as a cover for extermination and the fighting would conceal the real war aim\\". According to Margaret L. Anderson in 2010, Professor of History at the University of California, Berkeley, \\"we have no reason to doubt the remark is genuine, both attack and defense obscure an obvious reality\\" that the Armenian Genocide has achieved \\"iconic status... as the apex of horrors imaginable in 1939,\\" and that Hitler used it to persuade the German military that committing genocide excited a great deal of \\"talk\\" but no serious consequences for a nation that perpetrates genocide.\\"Who Still Talked about the Extermination of the Armenians: German Talk and German Silences\\" in A Question of Genocide: Armenians and Turks at the End of the Ottoman Empire, ed.

He is a \\"towering figure\\" in Coptic linguistics and made important contributions to Coptic historiography.. Retrieved 10 May 2020. ==Family and career== Nush≈´ æ al-KhilƒÅfa Ab≈´ ShƒÅkir ibn SanƒÅ æ al-Dawla al-RƒÅhib Abu  æl-Karam Bu·π≠rus ibn al- Muhadhdhib was born to a distinguished Coptic family of Old Cairo probably in the first decade of the 13th century, at least before 1235. His kin were mostly clergymen and officials of the Ayy≈´bid regime. His father, al-Shaykh al-Mu ætaman al-SanƒÅ æ AnbƒÅ Bu·π≠rus al-RƒÅhib, was a prominent scribe in the Coptic community. He served as the finance minister of Egypt under the Ayy≈´bids and also de facto administrator of the patriarchate of Alexandria towards the end of the long vacancy of 1216‚Äì1235. He led the opposition to the patriarchate of Cyril III in 1235‚Äì1243. In old age, after the death of his wife, he became a monk, whence his nickname rƒÅhib (monk) that appears in his son's nasab (patronymic). While a monk, he was appointed presbyter of the Church of Saint Sergius in Cairo. In 1260, Ibn al-RƒÅhib was appointed deacon of the famous Hanging Church by Patriarch Athanasius III, whose election he had opposed. He served in the department of the army under the Ayy≈´bids. He seems to have left public life around the time the Maml≈´ks came to power (1250). All of his writing took place during the period from 1257 to 1270/1271. In the last two decades of his life he only edited his works. He is known to have been a contemporary of the patriarchs Cyril III, Athanasius III, Gabriel III, John VII and Theodosius III, whose pontificate lasted from 1294 to 1300. According to Adel Sidarus, he died between 1290 and 1295. ==Writings== Ibn al-RƒÅhib wrote on all the topics about which a Copt of his time could know: astronomy, chronology, history, philology, philosophy, theology and hermeneutics. Although appreciated for his original contributions, he is more valued today for his use and quotation of a very wide variety of sources, classical Greek, patristic and Islamic. Four of his works are known: #The KitƒÅb al-TawƒÅrƒ´kh (Book of Histories) is his most famous work. It is known from three manuscripts. It is divided into 51 chapters. The first 47 are devoted to chronology and astronomy, followed by one chapter each on world history, Islamic history, church history and the seven ecumenical councils plus later councils accepted by the Copts. His work on the chronology of the patriarchs demonstrates his mathematical proficiency and is highly valuable to the historian. This book was highly influential. It was cited extensively by the Coptic historian Jirjƒ´s al-Makƒ´n, and then also by the Muslim historians al-Ma·∏≥rƒ´zƒ´ and Ibn Khald≈´n, although they are apparently reliant on al-Makƒ´n. In the early 16th century, it was translated into Ethiopic by ichege Enbaqom. A chronological manual based on this text is known as the Abushaker (Ab≈´ ShƒÅkir). Already in the 13th century, an anonymous writer composed an epitome of the three historical chapters (48‚Äì50). This text, known as the Chronicon orientale, has been mis-attributed to Ibn al-RƒÅhib since the 17th century. #In 1263, he completed a work on the Coptic language, including a rhymed vocabulary and a grammar. Only the prologue and the grammar survive. Written in the tradition of Arabic lexicography, his grammar is superior to the other Coptic manuals of his time. #The KitƒÅb al-shifƒÅ æ (Book of Healing), completed in 1267‚Äì68, is a work of Christology based exclusively on Biblical exegesis. It is a massive work structured around the notion of the Tree of Life with three trunks, each with three branches, each loaded with fruit. He quotes extensively from patristic sources and other Biblical commentaries, notably those of Ibn al-·π¨ayyib. An autograph copy of this is preserved in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris. It is dated to anno mundi 984, which corresponds to anno Domini 1268. A copy of this work dated AM 1398 (AD 1611) is also preserved in the patriarchal library in Cairo. #The KitƒÅb al-BurhƒÅn (Book of Evidence), completed in 1270‚Äì71, is a work of canon law, theology, ethics and philosophy in 50 chapters. The theodicy of Ibn al-RƒÅhib is taken from the Persian Muslim theologian Fakhr al-Dƒ´n al-RƒÅzƒ´. There is copy dated AM 987 (AD 1270) in the patriarchal library. ==See also== *Ab≈´ Is·∏•ƒÅ·∏≥ ibn al- øAssƒÅl *Abu  æl-BarakƒÅt ibn Kabar ==Notes== ==References== Category:1200s births Category:1290s deaths Category:13th-century Egyptian people Category:Coptic writers Category:Egyptian lexicographers ","title":"Ibn al-RƒÅhib"},{"id":"63907260","text":"Giovanni Menchi (born 25 October 1975) is an Italian equestrian.

She had two brothers, Neallei \\"Neal\\" Harrison (born 1918) and Joel Martin (born 1921). Before she graduated from High Point High School in 1941, she began working for the High Point Beacon newspaper, where her duties include writing the weekly Personality Parade column. She later operated a switchboard at a hotel. ==Career== Garner married a military man and moved to California, where he was stationed. Working as a cigarette girl at Ciro's nightclub, she was discovered by film executive Henry Willson. In 1943, she was introduced as a new member of the Goldwyn Girls dancing troupe. She did well enough in a bit part in David O. Selznick's film Since You Went Away that she was put under contract with his Vanguard Films in 1944. She signed a long- term contract with Universal-International in 1951, but the studio later ended it. Garner's other films included One Sunday Afternoon (1948), Flame of Araby (1951), and Red Ball Express (1952). As a result of her modeling, Garner's picture appeared on magazines distributed nationally, including Pic, Hit, Yank, Esquire, Modern Romance, and Modern Screen. She also was featured in pictures accompanying a Popular Photography article, Pin-ups or Trip-ups, in 1945. Garner was also active in visiting veterans' hospitals and making personal appearances on bond tours. == Later years == After Universal- International terminated Garner's contract and she and her husband separated, she had a nervous breakdown. She and her daughter moved to separate sites in North Carolina. Garner went to her mother's home, and the daughter lived with a relative. Garner never recovered from her mental health problems despite stays in hospitals and treatments that included electroshock therapy and a lobotomy. == Personal life == In the mid-1940s, Garner's marriage to her serviceman husband ended. She then married Elmo Marshall, and they had a daughter, Cathy Jo. Their marriage ended, and Garner remarried a third time, becoming Cindy Gray, although the two divorced after 1992. Garner had two grandchildren. == Selected filmography == *Show Business (1944) *Since You Went Away (1944) *Up In Arms (1944) *You Came Along (1945) *A Scandal in Paris (1946) *Till the End of Time (1946) *One Sunday Afternoon (1948), *Flame of Araby (1951). *Meet Danny Wilson (1952) *Red Ball Express (1952), *Ma and Pa Kettle at Waikiki (1955) == References == Category:1926 births Category:2002 deaths Category:20th-century American actresses Category:American film actresses Category:Actresses from North Carolina Category:Female models from North Carolina ","title":"Cindy Garner"},{"id":"63907287","text":"P Krishna Prasad is the finance secretary of All India Kisan Sabha and the former CPI(M) MLA from Sultan Bathery. He is also the chairman of Brahmagiri Development Society, a worker ‚Äì peasant cooperative in Kerala. == Life == P Krishna Prasad was born on 25 May 1967 to Kuttikrishnan Nair and Devakiamma in Sultan Bathery. He did his Bachelors from St. Joseph's College, Devagiri. His wife A R Sindu is a prominent political activist. She is the General secretary of the All India Federation of Anganwadi Workers and Helpers.

He became the Calicut University Union Chairman in 1987‚Äì88. He was later elected as the All India President of Student' Federation of India in 2000 at Chennai Conference. === Electoral politics === In 2006, P Krishna Prasad defeated N. D. Appachan, the sitting MLA of Sultan Bathery and won by a margin of 25,540 votes. He therefore became the only CPI(M) leader to get elected after P.V Varghese Vaidyar. The political history of Sultan Bathery donates that, except for 1996‚Äì2001 and 2006‚Äì11, the tenure of P.V Varghese Vaidyar and P Krishna Prasad respectively, Bathery constituency remains a confident hold of Indian National Congress. { class=\\"sortable \\" - ccc; text-align:center;\\" !

He came out strongly against the violence of cow vigilante groups and argued that their actions badly affected the livelihood of small and marginal farmers. After visiting the body of Gajendra Singh, a distressed Rajasthani farmer who committed suicide in front of Arvind Kejriwal (Delhi Chief Minister), Prasad and his organisation demanded Rs 10 lakh compensation for farmer's family in 2015. He was part of the two-day colloquium on \\"Corporate Concentration in Agriculture and Food\\", organized by Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung, Focus on Global South and Alternative Law Forum. He is a proponent of value addition in agrarian sector to combat the crisis faced by farmers, so that farmers get better price for their labour. He blames Congress party for the high rates of farmers suicide in Wayanad during their rule. He was one of the major organzier of Kisan-Mazdoor Sangharsh rally which culminated at Ramlila Maidan, New Delhi on 5th September 2018. == Cooperative movement == P Krishna Prasad is one of the major proponents of the cooperative movement in India. He is the chairman of the Wayanad-based Brahmagiri Development Society (BDS), a cooperative aiming to combat the agrarian crisis in Kerala by organising solidarity economy among peasants and workers. BDS is a social cooperative of more than 13,000 farmers. In agriculture, meat production and dairy, the BDS has enhanced significant self-sufficiency. The master brain behind Brahmagiri Development Society (BDS) is P.V Varghese Vaidyar, the former CPI(M) MLA from Sultan Bathery. Both in the electoral politics and cooperative movement Krishna Prasad is true successor to Varghese Vaidyar. In 2010, Krishna Prasad initiated a ten days long agricultural expo by organizing cooperatives. He was one of the important organizer of the National Workshop for Agrarian Crisis and Alternative Policies‚Äô which was held on 11 and 12 July, 2019 in Hyderabad. The workshop explored the potential for Cooperatives in the battle against agrarian crisis. His study along with Jose George on \\"Agrarian Distress and Farmers' Suicides in the Tribal District of Wayanad\\" has set a pathway to understand the Agrarian society of rural Wayanad. Under his leadership BDS has recently launched comprehensive projects to help out Coffee Farmers in distress. The branding of Wayanad Coffee was part of this initiative. == Reference == Category:Living people Category:1967 births Category:Communist party stubs Category:Indian communists Category:SFI All India Presidents ","title":"P Krishna Prasad"},{"id":"63907290","text":"Jennifer Eicher (born 10 October 1962) is a Swiss equestrian.

She was one of three sisters assassinated together at the direction of the country's dictator Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo. == Early years == Mar√≠a Teresa was the youngest of four sisters born into a wealthy family in the Dominican province of Salcedo (now, after a name change, it is called Hermanas Mirabal, or in English, Mirabel Sisters). Her parents were Enrique Mirabal Fern√°ndez and Mercedes Reyes Camilo.Peter Farrington (17 December 2013). \\"Mirabal Sisters of The Dominican Republic\\". The REAL Dominican Republic. Like her sisters before her, she attended Colegio Inmaculada Concepci√≥n de La Vega. She graduated from the Colegio Sagrado Coraz√≥n de Jes√∫s in Santiago de los Caballeros and in 1954, from the Liceo de San Francisco de Macor√≠s in mathematics. She then continued her studies to become a surveyor at the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo. On February 14, 1958, she married fellow engineer Leandro Guzm√°n and on February 17, 1959, their daughter Jacqueline was born. Maria Teresa admired her sister Minerva and like her became involved in political activities. In time, the siblings became known collectively as the Mirabal Sisters. Her outrage at the \\"trujillista tyranny\\" was so profound that she joined a January 1959 conspiracy that was hatched in the residence of Guido D'Alessandro (political nephew of her sister Minerva) to lay the foundations for what later would be called the June 14 Revolutionary Movement, hoping to overthrow dictator Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo. == Detentions == The three murdered Mirabal sisters. On January 20, 1960, Mar√≠a Teresa was detained at a military base in Salcedo, but released on the same day. Two days later, on January 22, she and sister Minerva were detained and taken to La Cuarenta, the infamous torture prison, and then transferred to another prison, La Victoria. They were released on February 7, 1960, but shortly thereafter, on March 18, Mar√≠a Teresa and Minerva were arrested again and returned to La Cuarenta. They were given a five-year sentence but that was reduced to three years on appeal, and they were released again on August 18, 1960. Mar√≠a Teresa was not intimidated by political confrontation saying, ‚ÄúLife is risked without thinking about possible personal benefits, since the main reason for which we fight is the complete cancellation of privileges [...] perhaps what is closest to us is death, but that idea does not intimidate me: we will continue fighting for what is just.\\" == Murders == On November 25, 1960, when three of the sisters, Minerva, Patria and Mar√≠a Teresa, were returning from visiting the prison holding their husbands, who were leaders of the June 14 Revolutionary Movement, the women were ambushed by agents of the Military Intelligence Service (SIM) outside of Puerto Plata. Each was fiercely beaten to death, as was their driver Rufino de la Cruz. At that time, Patria was 36 years old, Minerva was 34, and Mar√≠a Teresa was 24. Their bodies were found with the vehicle, destroyed at the bottom of a ravine. While the crime scene was meant to indicate that the sisters and driver died in the \\"accidental fall,\\" it became widely assumed that their deaths were the work of the dictator and became a source of national outrage and called \\"the last straw for the Dominican people.\\" == Aftermath == According to historian Bernard Diederich, the assassinations of the Mirabal sisters \\"had greater effect on Dominicans than most of Trujillo's other crimes.\\" The killings, he wrote, \\"did something to their machismo\\" and paved the way for Trujillo's own assassination six months later on May 30, 1961.Bernard Diederich (1999). Trujillo: The Death of the Dictator. Markus Wiener Publishing. p. 71. . In the Caribbean country today, the sisters are remembered as \\"symbols of both popular and feminist resistance.\\" == Tributes == Every year on November 25th, the three sisters, Minerva, Patria and Mar√≠a Teresa, are honored on the International Day to Eliminate Violence against Women, which was declared by the UN in their honor. Commemorations of all three sisters (called martyrs by some) have so far included many poems, songs and books, including Julia Alvarez's second novel In the Time of the Butterflies (1994). == See also == * Mirabal sisters == References == Category: 1935 births Category: 1960 deaths Category:Assassinated activists Category:Assassinated Dominican Republic people Category:Dominican Republic activists Category:Dominican Republic women activists Category:Hermanas Mirabal Province Category:People murdered in the Dominican Republic Category:Deaths by beating ","title":"Mar√≠a Teresa Mirabal"},{"id":"63907302","text":"Hendrik Degros (born 25 April 1975) is a Belgian equestrian.

Mason Hale transferred it to Xanthoparmelia in 1974. In 1986, Hale segregated five Xanthoparmelia species to the newly-created genus Arctoparmelia in 1986. This group of species, including X. separata, is characterized by the velvety, ivory-white to purplish colour of the lower surface of the thallus, the presence of alectoronic acid, and a geographical range restricted to arctic or boreal locations. Arctoparmelia separata is commonly known as the rippled ring lichen. ==Description== Arctoparmelia separata resembles the more common Arctoparmelia centrifuga, but is distinguished from that species by the dull mouse-grey colour of its lower surface, and its thicker and more rigid thallus, and its long lobes that are divaricately branched. The lichen has an incompletely circumpolar distribution. It has been recorded from northern North America, Greenland, and Japan, and Siberia west to Novaya Zemlya.

He is a Professor of Law at Vanderbilt University, where he has also been a Chancellor Faculty Fellow and the Director of the Program in Law and Government. He studies constitutional and foreign relations law. His books have addressed legal questions in counterinsurgency policy, the relationship between constitutional law and economic inequality, and the future of progressive politics in America. He is a longtime advisor to Elizabeth Warren, both before and during her political career. ==Education and positions== Sitaraman attended Harvard College, graduating with an AB degree in 2004. In 2005 he graduated from Emmanuel College, Cambridge with an MPhil, and then he returned to Harvard, obtaining a JD from Harvard Law School in 2008. During his education, Sitaraman became well acquainted with two future candidates in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. As an undergraduate at Harvard, he was friends with classmate Pete Buttigieg. Together they started a progressive reading group called the Democratic Renaissance Project. Then, at Harvard Law School, Sitaraman was mentored by Elizabeth Warren. In 2008, Sitaraman became a Public Law Fellow at Harvard Law School, and in 2010 he was a lecturer there. In 2011 he joined Vanderbilt Law School as a professor, where in 2017 he became the Director of the Program on Law and Government. In 2018 Sitaraman was named a Chancellor Faculty Fellow, a university-wide award for tenured professors. From 2008 to 2009, Sitaraman was an advisor to Elizabeth Warren in her role on the Congressional Oversight Panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. In 2010 and 2011, he was a legal clerk for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit judge Stephen F. Williams. Sitaraman was then the Policy Director for Elizabeth Warren during the 2012 United States Senate election in Massachusetts, and after her successful election as a United States Senator he worked as a senior counsel to her. In August 2013, Sitaraman was named a Senior Fellow of the Center for American Progress. In 2016, he was a Visiting Associate Professor of Law at Yale Law School. ==Research== In addition to his academic articles and chapters in edited volumes, Sitaraman has written or edited several books. With Previn Warren, he was a co-editor of the 2003 book Invisible citizens: Youth politics after September 11. In 2013, he published The counterinsurgent's constitution: Law in the age of small wars. In The counterinsurgent's constitution, Sitaraman takes an interdisciplinary approach from fields including history, policy, and law to study the applicability of international law to counterinsurgency operations, with the intention of remaining readable for a general audience. The focus of counterinsurgency on strengthening legal and economic institutions means that legal questions are some of the core challenges for counterinsurgency policy, yet The counterinsurgent's constitution was the first book to connect counterinsurgency policy to the laws of warfare. In 2017, Sitaraman published The crisis of the middle-class constitution: Why economic inequality threatens our republic. Sitaraman seeks to explain significant stresses that the American legal system is undergoing, and attributes these stresses to the collapse of the American middle class. Specifically, he studies the connection between the Constitution of the United States and economic inequality, arguing that the constitution is dependent on a substantial middle class to safeguard it, in contrast to constitutions that are created in conditions of economic inequality and encode rules to perpetuate that inequality. Sitaraman argues that when significant economic inequality threatens the efficacy of the constitution, structural change is required in order to recover political stability; a successful historical example of this process is the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which embedded reform in a fundamental legal modification, whereas the New Deal reformers were unsuccessful in the long run because the policy changes they pursued could eventually be reversed. The thesis of The crisis of the middle-class constitution, which connects economic inequality with the quality and stability of American governance, was covered in several media outlets including The Atlantic, The Washington Post, and The New York Times, where it was discussed by Angus Deaton. The crisis of the middle-class constitution was named as one of the 100 Notable Books of 2017 by The New York Times, and was a recipient of a 2018 PROSE Award for Outstanding Work by a Trade Publisher. Sitaraman published two books in 2019. With Anne L. Alstott, he published The public option: How to expand freedom, increase opportunity, and promote equality. He was also the author of the 2019 book The great democracy: How to fix politics, unrig the economy, and unite America. The great democracy describes a progressive platform for systemic change which is offered as an alternative to market-driven neoliberalism in the United States, including policy prescriptions for decreased barriers to citizen participation, expanded health care, legal reform, and climate policy. In The great democracy Sitaraman continues to connect changes in contemporary American politics with developments in the American economy, arguing that a rigged economy has created a rigged politics, and that a change is needed in American politics on the order of historic movements like New Deal progressivism. The release of the book was covered by a number of media outlets, many of which discussed how the thesis of the book mirrored a debate then ongoing in the 2020 Democratic primary race: Sitaraman was a longtime advisor to Elizabeth Warren, who was then advancing a vision for structural change in line with Sitaraman's thesis, whereas Pete Buttigieg, Warren's rival for the nomination and Sitaraman's college friend, was widely seen as advocating a non-structural and policy- based response to the same problems. Sitaraman credited both as influences in the book. Sitaraman's public scholarship has included publications in media outlets on topics like foreign policy. For example, he has advocated a shift in the foreign policy of the United States away from strict concern with national security towards a broader focus on the political economy of international wealth distribution. In 2018, Sitaraman was a recipient of the Andrew Carnegie Fellowship. ==Selected works== *\\"Counterinsurgency, the War on Terror, and the Laws of War\\", Virginia Law Review (2009) *The Counterinsurgent's Constitution: Law in the Age of Small Wars (2013) *\\"The Puzzling Absence of Economic Power in Constitutional Theory\\", Cornell Law Review (2015) *The crisis of the middle-class constitution: Why economic inequality threatens our republic (2017) *The great democracy: How to fix politics, unrig the economy, and unite America (2019) ==Selected awards== *Andrew Carnegie Fellowship (2018) ==References== Category:Alumni of Emmanuel College, Cambridge Category:American legal scholars Category:Harvard College alumni Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Harvard Law School faculty Category:Living people Category:Vanderbilt University Law School faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ganesh Sitaraman"},{"id":"63907406","text":"Harald Riedl (born 18 August 1961) is an Austrian equestrian.

It was the first he produced for the Augustinian San Gallo church in Florence, as recorded by Anonimo Magliabechiano and in Vasari's Lives of the Artists, and he later produced the San Gallo Annunciation and The Disputation on the Trinity for the same church. It is now in the Uffizi. Noli was commissioned by Leonardo Morelli, as shown by a papal brief of 9 April 1532. During the siege of Florence the monastery's artworks were moved within the city walls to San Jacopo tra i Fossi. The original church outside the walls was razed by Charles V's troops in 1531, but all its chapels were reconstructed at San Jacopo, with Noli ending up in the Morelli chapel. About a third of the painting was underwater during a flood in 1557. The original predella is lost, probably after being damaged in the flood, and replaced by a new one in the late 16th century - the new predella was later removed and is now in the Casa Vasari museum in Arezzo. The church was suppressed and turned into a barracks in 1849, upon which the Morelli family took back the painting, on the condition that it would remain on public display. However, they did not meet this condition and in 1875 the Italian state took legal action to confiscate the painting, exhibiting it at the Uffizi. Temporarily placed in the museum's stores, the Uffizi's Florentine galleries were reorganised and the work was reassigned to the Museo del Cenacolo di Andrea del Sarto, also in Florence. It remained there until early 2013, when it was returned to the Uffizi upon the redisplay of the latter's Sala di Michelangelo. ==References== Category:Paintings of the Uffizi Andrea del Sarto Category:Paintings by Andrea del Sarto category:1510 paintings ","title":"Noli me tangere (Andrea del Sarto)"},{"id":"63907472","text":"Magnus G√§llerdal (born 10 August 1979) is a Swedish equestrian.

Set in 1985 on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, it stars Molly Miles, Andrea Granera, and Alec Bandzes. The story chronicles the romantic relationship between 16-year-old Lily, and Mesa, a girl her age who she meets on the peninsula. ==Plot== Lily Peony is a precious sixteen year old girl who spends her summers on Cape Cod with her grandmother Anna. Throughout the previous years vacationing, the Peonys grew close with a Cape-native family: single-mother Velma and her teenage son John. During the summer of 1985, after being away from the peninsula for some time, Lily and John find themselves pursuing a mature and unexpected romance which has them both falling quickly for each other. That year, Lily also happens to meet Mesa - a teenage girl who is fascinating to Lily for her undeniable confidence and indescribable beauty. Mesa takes a clear interest in befriending Lily, intrigued by her quiet and mature nature. Through their shared time together, Lily realizes her feelings for Mesa are rather different from her feelings when she is with John. This provokes her internal struggle to identify herself, and feelings for Mesa, over her seemingly more traditional, yet less passionate, relationship with John. ==Cast== * Molly Miles as Lily Peony * Andrea Granera as Mesa * Alec Bandzes as John 'Johnny' Valentine * Patricia Ellis as Anna Peony * Kristin Stearns- Stewart as Velma Valentine * William Cummings as Noah == Production == With a budget $400, principal photography lasted six days, with locations on Cape Cod.

Because of his innovative musical arrangements and international success, he has been called \\"The King of Sudanese Jazz\\". He has composed numerous songs and performed all over Sudan, as well as in Europe, Africa and in the Gulf countries, where large communities of Sudanese exiles reside. == Personal life == Ahmed's father was a religious man, but the family already owned a phonograph and liked both religious madeeh singing as well as popular haqiba music. In an interview with the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram, Ahmed remembered: \\"My biggest worry was how not to upset my father, who was interested in Sufism, and was fond of madeeh, but felt that music and art distracted me from my studies.\\" As his father worked as a truck driver, the family frequently moved from one part of Sudan to another. Ahmed grew up in Al-Obeid, the capital of Kordofan Province, in Western Sudan, and eventually enrolled at the College of Fine Arts in Khartoum, where he studied graphic design. After graduation, he joined the Sudanese Ministry of Education as an illustrator of textbooks and comics magazines. He worked for several children's magazines like Al-Sabian, Maryud and Sabah magazine from 1960, until he retired from the Ministry of Education in 1995. Sharhabil's wife, Zakia Abdul-Gassim Abu Bakr, was the first female guitarist in Sudan, and several of their seven sons and daughters also have become musicians. == Musical career == Before becoming a guitar player, Sharhabil learned to play the oud, saxophone, trombone and trumpet. But it was the electric guitar which eventually became his favourite instrument. His smooth voice, full of vibrato, has added to his distinctive popularity. \\"I started out by learning to play the oud and traditional Sudanese music, and got a diploma from the music institute of Khartoum University. But my ambition was to develop something new. For this, the guitar seemed like the best instrument. Western instruments can approximate the scales of Sudanese music very well. After all, a lot of Western music is originally from Africa. I have absorbed different influences, from traditional Sudanese rhythms to calypso and jazz, and I hold them together in my music with no difficulty.\\" The electric guitar was originally introduced to the Khartoum music scene by musicians from Southern Sudan, who appreciated the popular guitar sound from their neighbours in the Congo. Congolese music, itself heavily influenced by South American and Caribbean sounds, had an important influence on Sudanese popular music in the 1960s. Even though Sharhabil has been commonly called \\"The King of Sudanese Jazz\\", and perhaps because of the occasional saxophone, his style of music has not much in common with the Western notion of Jazz music. Rather, Sharhabil‚Äôs sound can be called a unique combination of rock, funk, and Congolese music with a typical Sudanese character. Combining his soft vocals with the distinct sound of urban Sudanese music, he and his band became one of Sudan's most sought-after music groups. Over the years of his long career, he has published many songs and albums, available mostly in Sudan. As of 2018, Sharhabil Ahmed was still performing live at select occasions in Khartoum. In July 2020, Habibi funk, an independent music label based in Berlin, Germany, re-edited digital versions of some of Sharhabil's songs on an album called \\"The King Of Sudanese Jazz\\", with the title Argos Farfish and other songs available for free listening. \\\\- Announcing this compilation in the Financial Times, David Honigman describes the music in the following, vivid way: ==Discography== * Sharhabil Ahmed on discogs.com *The King Of Sudanese Jazz by Sharhabil Ahmed, Habibi Funk 2020 == See also == * Music of Sudan * List of Sudanese singers ==External links== * Bulbultain by Sharhabil Ahmed - music video * Hirman by Sharhabil Ahmed - music video * Sharhabil Ahmed and his band live at National Theatre, Omdurman * Sharhabil Ahmed and his son Shareef: TEDxKhartoum * Sharhabil Ahmed on Facebook == References == Category:Sudanese musicians Category:Sudanese singers Category:Sudanese graphic designers Category:People from Omdurman ","title":"Sharhabil Ahmed"},{"id":"63907567","text":"Dolf Desmedt (born 27 April 1980) is a Belgian equestrian.

It is thought that Slavic tribes lived here who fought with the Tatars, and later with the Hungarian feudal lords. The Bailova River which flows into the Tisza River, was the location of a large massacre there during the war with the Tatars, in which many people died.

It is a Grade II listed building. ==History== In the mid-19th century the local board of health had met at Rokeby House in Broadway. Following a rapid growth in the local population caused by industrial expansion, civic leaders decided to procure purpose-built council offices: the site chosen for the new building was a plot of open land on the corner of Broadway and West Ham Lane. The new building, which was designed by Lewis Angell and John Giles in the Italianate style was completed in 1869. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage with eleven bays facing onto Broadway; the central section of three bays featured a full-height portico with rounded-headed doorways flanked by Doric order banded columns on the ground floor and round-headed windows flanked by Corinthian order columns on the first floor. The left hand section curved round into West Ham Lane and the right handed section involved a square tower with a cupola and weather vane which was high. The principal rooms included a council chamber and an assembly hall which was elaborately decorated by the French designer, Mons Boekbinder. The design of the building was described by the Illustrated London News, in 1869, as the \\"finest building in Essex\\" and by Pevsner, in 1973, as a \\"debased arched cinquecento\\". The foundation stone for an extension along West Ham Lane was laid by the chairman of the local board, George Rivett, in 1885; the extension, which was also designed by Lewis Angell, was intended to accommodate a courthouse and cells. The building became the headquarters of the new Municipal Borough of West Ham in 1886 and, after becoming the centre of administration for the County Borough of West Ham in 1889, it became the home of the first Labour Party municipal administration in 1898. The town hall continued to be the home of the county borough for much of the 20th century but ceased to be the local seat of government after the formation of the London Borough of Newham in 1965. It then served as offices for the education department of Newham council until a major fire broke out causing considerable damage on 26 June 1982. It was restored to the designs of the borough architect, Kenneth Lund, and was re-opened by Queen Elizabeth II as a conference centre on 16 July 1986. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Newham Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1869 Category:Grade II listed government buildings ","title":"Stratford Town Hall"},{"id":"63907712","text":"Lyudmila Mokhnacheva also written as Ljudmila Mokhnatsjeva and Ljudmila Mokhnatsjeva (Russian: –õ—é–¥–º–∏–ª–∞ –ú–æ—Ö–Ω–∞—á–µ–≤–∞, born 1944) is a Soviet former long track speed skater, who was active in the 1960s and 1970s.

Youghal, a town in the province of Munster, Ireland was controlled by the English when it was targeted by Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond, leader of the Irish forces fighting the English army at the time. == Background == Following defeat in the First Desmond Rebellion, James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald, leader of the rebellion, left the country in search of aid from Catholic powers on the continent. With support from the Papacy, he planned to invade Ireland. Fitzmaurice's fleet landed near Dingle in July 1579, after capturing English ships in the English Channel. His forces set up camp at D√∫n an √ìir, a fortress in Ard na Caithne (known by the English as Smerwick), beginning the Second Desmond Rebellion. Afterwards however, his ships were captured by the English. Meanwhile, Gerald Fitzgerald, the Earl of Desmond (Desmond) was reluctant to join the rebellion. However, the Crown authorities in Dublin Castle declared him a traitor and, with limited choices, he chose to join the rebellion. Later, Fitzmaurice was killed in a skirmish in County Tipperary and command of the rebellion passed to the Earl. == Sacking == Youghal's 13th-century \\"water gate\\" is reputedly where the garrison made its last stand against the Desmond attack As the one of the main bases of English power in southern Munster, Youghal was selected by Desmond for attack. And he opened his command of the rebellion by sacking the town. He massacred the English garrison stationed there and hanged the English authorities and officials. His forces also abused the local population, and looted and burned many of the townspeople's homes. The last of the soldiers and townspeople made their final stand at Youghal's \\"water gate\\" but were ultimately slaughtered. One of Desmond's allies, MacCarthy M√≥r, launched a similar attack on English- held Kinsale. Much of the land around the English held areas of Munster were ravaged by the Irish, and a blockade was put on the city of Cork, where many fled to relative safety inside the walls to avoid the destruction throughout the province. == Aftermath == The English authorities in Ireland were horrified by these attacks. Many English commanders carried out brutal reprisals throughout the country. Later, after the 3-day Siege of Smerwick, the Spanish and Papal garrison at Ard na Caithne were massacred by English forces after surrendering. == See also == * Battle of Glenmalure == References == Category:History of County Waterford Category:Youghal ","title":"Sack of Youghal"},{"id":"63907832","text":"Muteb Mansour Al-Mutairi (; born 1 January 1997) is a Saudi Arabian professional footballer who plays as a left-back for Saudi club Al-Orobah. ==Club career== Muteb Mansour started his career at Al-Batin in the Saudi Professional League, during the 2018‚Äì19 season.

In August 2015, Delhi woman Jasleen Kaur posted a photo of a man, Sarvjeet Singh, on Facebook and accused him of harassment. The post immediately went viral on Indian social media and garnered widespread attention. She received widespread support for raising her voice against eve- teasing and sexual harassment on social media including from national celebrities and politicians. Sarvjeet was arrested the next day and was bailed the day after. It was followed by a trial by media in which Sarvjeet was labelled by terms like \\"National Pervert\\" and \\"Delhi ka Darinda\\" (Delhi's predator) on national news channels. A few days after the incident, an eyewitness vouched for Sarvjeet's innocence which brought credibility to Sarvjeet's account. After four years, in 2019, the Indian court acquitted Sarvjeet of all the charges and he was held innocent. == Events == === Background === On August 23, 2015, Jasleen Kaur, a former student at St. Stephen's College, posted a picture of a man claiming he passed obscene comments at her during an argument on road. After the post went viral, Sarvjeet was immediately arrested a day after by the local police under section 354A (Sexual harassment), 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) and 509 (Word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code.

Today he had the audacity to say these things to me, > tomorrow he will have the audacity to move one step ahead and do it. PS- I > could've written here exactly what he said in his comments, but i don't want > FB to remove my post.  Jasleen's account  Jasleen claimed Sarvjeet was trying to jump the red signal. She asked him to follow the traffic rules to which Sarvjeet replied with obscene comments. The court later observed the complainant had made material alterations to her previous statements, concluding that \\"the testimony of the complainant is not trustworthy and casts serious doubt on the case of the prosecution.\\"  Sarvjeet's account  Sarvjeet claimed he wasn't breaking any of the traffic rules as he was intending to take a left- turn which is a free-turn even on a red signal. He explained this to Jasleen which was construed rude by her. Jasleen took pictures and posted it on social media providing a false summary of events. Sarvjeet also claimed Jasleen fabricated events as a publicity stunt to gain a political mileage as she is a supporter of the Aam Aadmi Party, an Indian political party. === Reactions === The Facebook post shared by Jasleen on August 23rd, 2015 immediately went viral on the social media in India with over 100,000 shares. Reactions in support of the Jasleen, lauding her bravery, and expressive of disgust and contempt for Sarvjeet came thick and fast, beginning the same day: The next day, on August 24th, the then Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted lauding her bravery asking all the girls of Delhi to speak up against such unacceptable acts. The Delhi Commission for Woman (DCW) Chief, Swati Maliwal also came in support of Jasleen. The Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) said that she will be given 5000 rupees for her bravery. Actress Sonakshi Sinha also came in support of Jasleen, however later tweeted apologizing to Sarvjeet for the presumption of guilt. After this incident, Sarvjeet has claimed he had lost his job short after the incident took place because of the media coverage and couldn't find any other stable source of income. === Times Now fined === The news channel Times Now was fined a sum of Rs. 50,000 by the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA), and was asked to apologize on-air. Times Now had interviewed the accused in an ‚Äúaggressive, intimidating, and browbeating style, and the telecast of the interview with tag-lines treating the accused as guilty\\". == Judgment == On October 24th, 2019, four years after the incident, the court passed the judgment. All the charges were dismissed and Sarvjeet was held innocent. He was acquitted of all the charges against him. == See also == *Rohtak sisters viral video controversy ==References== Category:Controversies in India Category:2015 controversies ","title":"Jasleen Kaur harassment controversy"},{"id":"63907929","text":"Izabela Matusz (born 1974, in Warsaw) is a Polish diplomat; ambassador to Peru (2013‚Äì2017). == Life == Matusz graduated from international economic relations at the SGH Warsaw School of Economics.

Schwartz. The Borel graph theorem shows that the closed graph theorem is valid for linear maps defined on and valued in most spaces encountered in analysis. Recall that a topological space is called a Polish space if it is a separable complete metrizable space and that a Souslin space is the continuous image of a Polish space. The weak dual of a separable Fr√©chet space and the strong dual of a separable Fr√©chet‚ÄìMontel space are Souslin spaces. Also, the space of distributions and all Lp-spaces over open subsets of Euclidean space as well as many other spaces that occur in analysis are Souslin spaces. The Borel graph theorem states: :Let X and Y be locally convex Hausdorff spaces and let u : X \\\\to Y be linear. If X is the inductive limit of an arbitrary family of Banach spaces, if Y is a Souslin space, and if the graph of u is a Borel set in X \\\\times Y, then u is continuous. An improvement upon this theorem, proved by A. Martineau, uses K-analytic spaces. A topological space X is called a K_{\\\\sigma \\\\delta} if it is the countable intersection of countable unions of compact sets. A Hausdorff topological space Y is called K-analytic if it is the continuous image of a K_{\\\\sigma \\\\delta} space (that is, if there is a K_{\\\\sigma \\\\delta} space X and a continuous map of X onto Y). Every compact set is K-analytic so that there are non-separable K-analytic spaces. Also, every Polish, Souslin, and reflexive Frechet space is K-analytic as is the weak dual of a Frechet space. The generalized theorem states: :Let X and Y be locally convex Hausdorff spaces and let u : X \\\\to Y be linear. If X is the inductive limit of an arbitrary family of Banach spaces, if Y is a K-analytic space, and if the graph of u is closed in X \\\\times Y, then u is continuous. == See also == * Closed graph theorem == References == ==Bibliography== * == External links == Category:Functional analysis ","title":"Borel graph theorem"},{"id":"63907995","text":"Cheilosia cynocephala is a Palearctic hoverfly. ==Description== A black Cheilosia with a bluish sheen, darkened wings and dark hairs.

However, officials emphasized that the report contains readily apparent contradictions and factual errors, and that the peacekeeping force lacks the expertise to conclusively determine the cause of the crash; a joint accident investigation by officials from Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya is underway, with preliminary findings expected in 45 days. In addition to investigating the crash itself, Somali leaders questioned why Ethiopian troops outside the authority of the peacekeeping force were conducting armed operations in Somalia; there has been a history of controversial unauthorized incursions into Somalia by Ethiopian and Kenyan troops pursuing Al-Shabaab militants. ==See also== *List of aircraft shootdowns ==References== Category:2020 in international relations Category:2020 in Somalia Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia Category:Airliner shootdown incidents Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2020 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Somalia Category:Bay, Somalia Category:May 2020 events in Africa Category:Military operations involving Ethiopia ","title":"2020 East African Express Airways Brasilia crash"},{"id":"63908135","text":"Hannibal \\"Mike\\" Ware is the inspector general of the United States Small Business Administration.

The scandal had worldwide effects which lasted for decades. == Background == Potos√≠ was founded in 1545 as a mining town near Cerro Rico, a mountain which contained enormous quantities of silver ore. By 1570, a new process using mercury amalgamation was developed which allowed the silver ores of the mountain to be profitably exploited using forced labor in hazardous conditions. By the early 1600s, Potos√≠ had a population of 160,000. In 1572, the first National Mint of Bolivia was constructed to process the smelted silver into real coins, which were then shipped to Arica on the western coast of South America and thereon to the Spanish Main and points around the world. The minted coins were to have a silver content of 93 parts per 100, as decreed by King Philip IV of Spain in 1642. == Scandal == Rumors of the fineness of the silver coins from Potosi began to circulate in the early 1600s. Slave owners and mint officials blamed the mint slaves as being the culprits behind reduced fineness of coins minted at Potos√≠. Complaints from the Kingdom of Aragon and the Kingdom of Castile in 1648 asserted the coins to be worth as little as 5 reales instead of 8 reales. Royal trials confirmed the coins from Potos√≠ contained only 75% of the silver they were supposed to contain. In response to this, King Philip sent Francisco de Nestares Mar√≠n, a former inquisitor, to investigate the situation. He began his investigation at the end of 1648. Mar√≠n's investigation revealed that the fraud permeated the entire silver operation. Key figures in the fraud were Francisco G√≥mez de la rocha, a rich former corregidor of Potos√≠, and Juan Ramirez de Arellano, an assayer at the mint. Both of them were executed for their crimes, and other assayers at the mint were fined or removed from their positions. The corregidor of Potos√≠ was removed from his position and imprisoned. Several silver merchants were also executed. Mar√≠n named Juan Rodr√≠guez de Rodas as the head assayer of the mint, a purpose for which he had been sent from Spain. Coins minted under Rodas were known as \\"rodases\\", while the debased coins were referred to as \\"rochunas\\". However the new coins, though better, were still short of the required fineness. == Impact and aftermath == The impact of the scandal had a large impact on Habsburg Spain, causing a global panic with effects reaching as far as Southeast Asia. Spanish war efforts of the time were impacted. Trade was significantly affected, and while decisions were being made about what to do with the suspect currency, people held onto their Potosi origin coins. With mistrust of the currency, trade was paralyzed in some places, consumer product availability reduced, and prices increased. Spanish currency in Europe was discredited. In October 1650 King Philip ordered that 8 and 4 real coins were to be devalued. This affected all coins from the Potosi mint that were in circulation, whether they were of appropriate fineness or not. For this purpose, he gave Garc√≠a Sarmiento de Sotomayor, the Viceroy of Peru, discretion to implement the mandate as he saw fit. In January 1652, Sotomayor decreed that the rochunas coins would be devalued to 6 reales and submitted for melting. The new 8 real rodases would be worth 7.5 reales, and the 4 real rodases would be worth 3.75 reales. The lower denominations of coins were unchanged. As part of the decision, the new rodases had to be countermarked to indicate their worth. Some of the older rochunas coins were fraudulently countermarked to indicate they were worth 7.5 reales, which further debased trust in the rodas coins. New, replacement coins with new marks began production in March 1652 with a value of 8 reales. These new coins replaced the rochunas and rodas in circulation, which were subsequently declared illegal for trade in 1657. == References == Category:Potos√≠ Category:Early Modern history of Spain Category:1649 in economics ","title":"Great Potosi Mint Fraud of 1649"},{"id":"63908202","text":"The Indian FTR1200 is an American motorcycle manufactured by Indian Motocycle Manufacturing Company since 2019.

While not as well known as Churchill works like Cloud 9 (1979) and Top Girls (1982), it has been praised by many critics. == Reception == After viewing the Joint Stock Theatre Group performance at the LuEsther Hall, John Beaufort of The Christian Science Monitor billed Fen as \\"a fascinating mosaic in theatrical terms.\\" Beaufort praised \\"the authenticity of its material, the skill with which the elements have been drawn together by Miss Churchill, and the performance of a remarkable troupe.\\" In The New York Times, Frank Rich described the play as \\"dour, difficult and [...] never coy about its rather stridently doctrinaire socialism: it's the most stylistically consistent of Miss Churchill's plays and at times the most off-putting. It is also yet another confirmation that its author possesses one of the boldest theatrical imaginations to emerge in this decade.\\" The critic wrote that Churchill's \\"concentrated dramatization of their lives has an open, poetic intensity that transcends the flat tendentiousness of mere agitprop.\\" In 2004, Paul Taylor of The Independent argued of the play, \\"It's amazing how much detail and insight Churchill manages to pack into a succession of spare, short scenes that here succeed each other with a heightened, dream-like fluency. The effect is a haunting blend of intimacy (often dourly comic) and (with roles deliberately cast regardless of age and looks) objectifying defamiliarisation.\\" In 2011, academic Jill Dolan wrote that Fen \\"represents the British feminist playwright at her best\\". She praised set pieces such as the dirt covering the playing area: \\"Even when scenes move to various characters‚Äô homes or other social settings, the dirt remains, a palpable reminder that these people are always mired in the manual labor that provides their only livelihood.\\" The critic argued that \\"Churchill doesn‚Äôt lay individual blame, but constructs a social constellation in which each character is interdependent with the others, even if their access to power and wealth differently marks their experience.\\" Dolan wrote that \\"Fen is wrenching because even in the midst of such lack, the characters do dream. Val isn‚Äôt the only woman with desires; they‚Äôre all simply at different stages of reconciling to the fact that they‚Äôll never be fulfilled.\\" Tom Wicker of Exeunt praised the play as \\"unsentimental and richly written\\". Wicker praised the set design as evocative and also stated that the dialogue \\"is suitably earthy, enriched with colloquialisms and nuggets of folklore that turn the play into something more interesting and freestanding than the straightforward diatribe against early ‚Äò80s capitalism it threatens to be at the start.\\" In The Guardian, Lyn Gardner described Fen as a \\"mysterious, tantalising play that, with its elliptical scenes and multiple characters, refuses to spoon-feed its audience. It offers a clear-eyed, feminist-socialist perspective on women and labour, but there is something darker and wilder lurking in its witchy psychic landscape.\\" Gardner dubbed the work \\"a reminder that British theatre has produced no more a courageous writer or one who mines our dark, damaged psyches with such forensic thoughtfulness as Churchill.\\" Don Aucoin of The Boston Globe reviewed the 2012 Factory Theatre performance positively, stating (with regards to the phrase \\"class warfare\\") that \\"Churchill has always understood which side is the aggressor. That comprehension, fortified by Churchill‚Äôs strongly feminist outlook, undergirds her desolate and gripping 1983 drama 'Fen.'\\" Aucoin described the work as \\"a series of brief but indelible vignettes\\" and viewed Val as the play's most poignant figure, arguing that her actions are believable given her extreme circumstances. == References == == External links == * Category:Plays by Caryl Churchill Category:1983 plays Category:Feminist plays ","title":"Fen (play)"},{"id":"63908242","text":"Nathalie Saint-Criq (born in 1960) is a French journalist, working for France T√©l√©visions. == Biography == === Training === Nathalie Saint-Cricq earned her degree from Sciences Po in 1983, and a \\"Diploma of Higher Specialised Studies\\" in marketing in 1985, before gaining a master's degree in literature. === Media career === Saint-Cricq produced reports for La Cinq and then France 2.

Her research considers how ethnicity and lifestyle impact people's risk factors for disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chaturvedi explained that the increased coronavirus mortality rate for people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds was due to societal inequality and how this intersects with healthcare. == Early life and education == Chaturvedi studied medicine at the University of London and graduated in 1985. She specialised in public health and epidemiology, and completed a medical doctorate at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust studying hypertension in Afro-Caribbean communities. Chaturvedi was a postdoctoral research associate at University College London, where she worked in the Department of Epidemiology. == Research and career == In 2000 Chaturvedi was appointed Chair of Clinical Epidemiology in the National Heart and Lung Institute. She returned to University College London as Chair in Epidemiology in the Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences in 2014. Chaturvedi studies the mechanisms of disease and modes of prevention of cardiovascular disease, with a focus on minority ethnic communities in the United Kingdom. She leads the Southall and Brent REvisited (SABRE) study, which has monitored the health of a 5,000 person cohort of Europeans, South Asians and African Caribbeans in London for over twenty years. SABRE started in 1988, when the first generation of South Asian and African Caribbeans in the United Kingdom were approaching middle-age. It investigated the risk of stroke, diabetes and heart disease amongst participants, and helped to inform medical guidelines. Chaturvedi showed that the high levels of hypertension only started when migrants moved from the Caribbean or West Africa to the United Kingdom; meaning that these levels were due to lifestyle, rather than genetic selection. In 2008, Chaturvedi re- visited the study, analysing how the health of the original cohort had changed over time. In 2012 the SABRE study observed that by the age of eighty, twice as many South Asians and African Caribbeans members of the cohort had developed diabetes compared to the European group. Whilst a risk factor for diabetes in family history, Chaturvedi explained that this alone could not explain the overrepresentation of diabetes amongst South Asian and African Caribbean populations. Instead, SABRE showed that healthy eating and an active lifestyle was crucial in avoiding risk of disease (in particular heart disease and Type 2 diabetes). She went on to study the evolution of HBA1c, a modified form of Haemoglobin A1c, changed as Type 2 diabetes progressed, and how this progression might be related to gender and ethnicity. Chaturvedi made use of data from the UK Biobank to monitor how levels of HBA1c are related to other long-term conditions, including dementia and cancer, as well as how these complications may be linked to ethnicity or gender. Chaturvedi is part of the Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC), a worldwide network of medical researchers that look to better understand risk factors in different countries. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it emerged that in the UK, people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds were disproportionately suffering from coronavirus disease. Writing for The Guardian, Chaturvedi explained that could be due to several reasons, including that the United Kingdom's outbreak of coronavirus disease started in London, the most diverse city in the country, and that co-morbidities (e.g. conditions such as hypertension) could be significant prognostic factors. Ultimately, Chaturvedi argued that healthcare inequality, and the close relationship between socio-economic status and clinical outcome in the UK, was contributing to the increased mortality rates for people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. Ethnic minorities are more likely to be employed in 'essential' high-risk sectors, including transport and healthcare, and live in multi- generational, densely populated households. She explained that the differences in clinical outcome for people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds was not due to genetics; ‚ÄúEthnicity is a complex socio-cultural construct, it‚Äôs not a biology construct. There‚Äôs no gene for being Asian. There‚Äôs no gene for being black,‚Äù. She developed a survey for members of the SABRE cohort to better understand the prevalence of coronavirus disease and its impact on black and minority ethnic communities. == Selected publications == * * * == References == ==External links== * Nishi Chaturvedi at University College London Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Alumni of the University of London Category:Academics of the University of London Category:British epidemiologists Category:Coronavirus researchers Category:British women scientists ","title":"Nishi Chaturvedi"},{"id":"63908336","text":"The 403rd Security Division (403. Sicherungs-Division) was a rear-security division in the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany. Throughout the war, the unit was mainly deployed in the Army Group South Rear Area behind the Eastern Front, which was a large, German-occupied area of the Soviet Union. == Operational history == === Division z.b.V. 403 === The Division z.b.V. 403, alternatively known as Landessch√ºtzen-Division 403, was established on 25 October 1939 in Spandau, which was in the III Military District. It was to consist of ten Territorial Guard (Landessch√ºtzen) battalions from the III Military District. August 1940 onwards, the division was part of the 6th Army, which was at the time in Brittany. It was renamed to 403rd Security Division in March 1942. === 403rd Security Division === The division was formed on 15 March 1941 near Neusalz in Silesia, in the VIII Military District, from the staff of Division z.b.V. 403 and elements of the 213th Infantry Division. During the whole war, the 403rd Security Division was used throughout the war mainly on the Eastern Front for security tasks in the rear army area, such as capturing scattered Soviet soldiers and commissars. Further anti-Semitic measures, such as confiscations, removal of functions, the formation of \\"purely\\" Jewish houses, followed. In 1941, the division fought in the Battle of Moscow and the Battle of Smolensk as part of the Heeresgruppenreserve. During this period, the division was used against the civilian population and burned down numerous villages. At the beginning of 1942, the fallback line of the division was broken by the Red Army near Toropets. In the summer of 1942, the division partook in actions against Jews in eastern Ukraine. At the beginning of 1943 the division was split into parts, with one part being assigned to the XXIVth Army Corps of the 2nd Panzer Army and the other to the XXXXth Army Corps assigned to the 4th Army. On 31 May 1943 in southern Russia, the division was dissolved. The division staff moved to Bergen in June 1943 and became the staff of the 265th Infantry Division. == Commanders == Commanding officers == Further reading == *Organizational History of 371st through 719th German Infantry, Security and Panzer Grenadier Divisions 1939‚Äì1945 (PDF; 394 kB), Nafziger Collection, Combined Armed Research Library. *Division z.b.V. 403 / 403.

Bland, and was designed over a period stretching from 1911 to 1915. It was adopted on the city's first flag in 1929, which still remains in use today. This seal itself was rescinded at an unknown date and replaced with the present one. In its current form, it is the city's logo on a golden seal, and it is used to authorize executive documents from the city, including, but not limited to, mayoral proclamations and resolutions from the city council. Based on the adoption of the crown logo in 1985 with the current flags, it is possible the current seal could have been adopted at that time as well, however, this is unknown, and city archives from the era do not depict any seal. == Description and meaning == === Original seal === Symbolizing growth is a tree in the center, with rays radiating from behind it, symbolizing hope for the future. Hanging on the tree is a hornet's nest, a Revolutionary War- era symbol, symbolizing the role the city played during the time period. This is explained in a pamphlet produced by the city, reading:More symbolism related to the era can be found within on seal, with a Liberty Cap present, hanging on the tree besides the nest. Beneath the tree are two hands clasped. The date \\"1775\\" is found below the hands, the year the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence was supposedly adopted, a year before the Continental Congress adopted their declaration. === Current seal === The current seal is much simpler in design, simply featuring the city's service mark atop a golden seal. On official documents, a green ribbon is typically found below it. The crown references the city's nickname of The Queen City, which references its namesake, Queen Charlotte. It also represents unity of the city's agencies as they work in unison for the good of its residents. === Corporate seal === The corporate seal shares design elements with the original seal, such as the text surrounding the seal, as well as the dates, and two five-pointed stars. It is the simplest of all the designs, consisting of only text and dashed lines, aside from the stars. == Use == The custodian of the seal is Charlotte's city clerk, who keeps it and all records and official documents bearing the seal. The City Clerk uses the corporate seal of Charlotte to certify that city records are authentic, exact reproductions of the originals. ==References== ","title":"Seal of Charlotte, North Carolina"},{"id":"63908383","text":"Irada Guliyeva (; born 17 December 1973) is an Azerbaijani former footballer who played as a defender.

Her father, James Cosgrave, was in the Royal Irish Constabulary and was from Ballysilla, near Oulart Hill, County Wexford. Her mother was Mary (n√©e Rochfort). Both of her parents died from tuberculosis, her father in November 1869, and her mother in 1870. Cosgrave's brothers found jobs with the Dublin & Wexford Railway, the older brother also contracting tuberculosis. The other brother then emigrated to the United States, where it is believed he too died of tuberculosis. Cosgrave and her sister went to live with a relative, John Cosgrave of Ballinvary, Davidstown, Enniscorthy, County Wexford. She was educated at the Loreto convent, Enniscorthy, leaving at age 15. Cosgrave met Bishop James David Ricards, vicar apostolic of the eastern districts of the Cape Colony, when he visited Wexford in 1880 looking for recruits to the Dominican convent in King William's Town. Inspired by his call, Cosgrave travelled to King William's Town to enter the order at age 16 arriving on 19 January 1881, eventually taking the name Sister Patrick. There she taught at the convent school, as well as in East London and Potchefstroom. ==Career== Cosgrave responded to an appeal from the superior of the Jesuit Zambezi mission, Fr A. Daignault, in 1889 to volunteer to aid in establishing an ambulance and hospital service for the British South Africa Company's pioneer column which was to occupy Mashonaland. Appointed mother superior of five sisters, the group of nuns stayed behind at Macloutsie at the base hospital. She befriended Col. Edward Pennefather, the commander of the column, who was also from County Wexford. The sisters travelled to Fort Salisbury in Mashonaland in July 1891 with Major Arthur Glyn Leonard. Having become friends with Leonard in spite of their political differences, he described Cosgrave: \\"She is a young Irish woman with a pretty brogue, and a face which is sweet beyond measure ‚Äì not with the beauty of the flower that fades, but with the beauty of a pure and noble expression that is immortal, though tinged at times with a shade of sadness.\\" Once in Salisbury, Cosgrave organised the first hospital, which was located in a series of grass huts and tents before a purpose-built hospital was built in 1895. She became known for treating everyone equally and for her good humour, having once danced an Irish jig to entertain and rally her patients. She opened the Salisbury convent in October 1892, which housed the first school for Europeans and would go on to educate Doris Lessing, among others. After the occupation of Matabeleland in 1894, she established a hospital and St George's College for Boys in Bulawayo. During the African uprisings in Matabeleland and Mashonaland in 1896, Cosgrave accompanied relief columns to Gwelo to organise an emergency hospital, and was later awarded the British South Africa Company's campaign medal. In 1898 the Rhodesian Dominicans spilt from the mother house at King William's Town and became an independent community. Cosgrave toured England in June 1898 to recruit postulants. During this trip she was invested with the Royal Red Cross. When she returned to Southern Rhodesia, she was elected prioress of the Dominican order. ==Death and legacy== Cosgrave died in the hospital she had founded on 31 July 1900 of tuberculosis. Her funeral was the largest European funeral to have been held in the territory at that time, and she is buried in the pioneer section of Salisbury Cemetery. After her death, Sir Charles Coghlan, led an annual pilgrimage to her grave on St Patrick's day. Her grave was marked with a seven-foot-high granite Celtic cross designed by Hugh J. Scott, and was unveiled by Sir Marshal Clarke on 17 March 1903. The original hospital building she founded, a prefabricated hut, is now a museum dedicated to her. Cosgrave was included in a series of stamps featuring pioneers of Rhodesia in the 1970s. ==References== Category:People from County Meath Category:1863 births Category:1900 deaths Category:19th-century Irish people Category:19th-century Christian nuns ","title":"Mary Anne Cosgrave"},{"id":"63908697","text":"Vui Manu'a was a Western Samoan chief and politician.

Anstey made warnings to Lord Mountbatten, Chief of the Defence Staff, Sir Solly Zuckerman, Chief Scientific Adviser, the members of the Joint Inter-Services Group for the Study of All-Out Warfare (JIGSAW) and the US Joint Chiefs of Staff concerning the dangers of escalating an already tense situation, and emphasising the importance of negotiation and conciliation, rather than a pre-emptive strike. Eventually this was the response followed by President John F. Kennedy. Anstey was Director of the Behavioural Sciences Research Division (BSRD) of the Civil Service Department from 1969 to 1977. When the Civil Service Commission merged with the personnel management division of HM Treasury to create the Civil Service Department in 1969 Anstey was the Deputy Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research until his retirement in 1977. During the 1960s and 1970s he wrote a number of books which explained serious occupational psychological matters with a light and humorous touch. His publications included: Interviewing for the Selection of Staff (with Dr. E. O. Mercer, 1956); Staff Reporting and Staff Development (1961); Committees, How They Work and How to Work Them (1962), all published by Allen & Unwin, and Psychological Tests (Thomas Nelson, 1966).Publications of Dr. Edgar Anstey - SAGE Journals During this period he completed a PhD at University College London, under the supervision of Sir Cyril Burt. ==Later years== Strong-willed and an independent thinker, he often came into conflict with those in positions above him which perhaps explains why he did not receive an honour at the end of his 36-year career in the Civil Service in 1977. An enthusiastic surfer and walker, on his retirement Anstey and his wife moved to Polzeath in Cornwall where they had regularly spent family holidays since the 1950s. He got involved in local politics on behalf of the Liberal Party, becoming a constituency officer and then President of the local party from 1985 to 1990. His wife predeceased him in 2000. Edgar Anstey died at Polzeath in 2009 aged 92 and was survived by his son, David Anstey, and four grandchildren. ==References== Category:1917 births Category:2009 deaths Category:People from Mumbai Category:People educated at Winchester College Category:Alumni of King's College, Cambridge Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Dorset Regiment officers Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:20th-century British civil servants Category:English psychologists Category:20th-century psychologists ","title":"Edgar Anstey (psychologist)"},{"id":"63908727","text":"Thomas Barbour Bryan (December 22, 1828 in Alexandria, Virginia ‚Äì January 26, 1906 in Washington, D.C.) was an American businessman, lawyer, and politician. Born in Virginia, a member of the prestigious Barbour family on his mother's side and a great-nephew of Daniel Boone on his father's side, Bryan largely made a name for himself in Chicago, Illinois. Bryan was involved in many ventures in the city, such as the creation of Graceland Cemetery, and was active in the city's politics, having twice been nominated for mayor. Bryan was a strong unionist during the American Civil War. Bryan was instrumental in Chicago being awarded the World's Columbian Exposition, and was involved in the exposition's organization and operation. Bryan also played a key role in the development of the Chicago suburb of Elmhurst, Illinois, where he resided much of his life. In addition to his involvement in Chicago politics, Bryan spent a brief period as a Commissioner of the District of Columbia. ==Early life, education, and family== Bryan was born in Alexandria, Virginia on December 22, 1828. His father was Daniel Bryan, and his mother was Mary Thomas Bryan (). Bryan's father was a poet and a lawyer, abolitionist, and statesman who served from 1821 to 1853 as Alexandria's postmaster, and who, from 1818 through 1820 served in the Senate of Virginia. A member of the esteemed Barbour family through his mother, Bryan's maternal uncles were James Barbour and Philip Pendleton Barbour. His maternal grandfather was Thomas Barbour. Bryan's nephew, would be Bryan Lathrop, with whom he would later form a personal and business relationship. Another nephew would be Barbour Lathrop. Bryan was first cousins with Sextus Barbour. Bryan's paternal great-uncle was Daniel Boone. His paternal grandfather had been William Bryan, one of the founders of Bryan Station, and his maternal grandmother had been Mary Boone Bryan. Bryan was educated at Virginia's top preparatory schools. For four years, Bryan held a clerkship with the post office that his father oversaw. The clerkship paid $300 annually, which Bryan saved up before leaving to attend Harvard University. Bryan graduated from Harvard Law School in 1848. ==Adult life and career== After graduating from Harvard Law School, Bryan practiced law in Cincinnati until 1852. In 1850, Bryan married Jennie Byrd Page, who became Mrs. Jennie Byrd Bryan. In 1852, Bryan and his wife moved to Chicago, where he had acquired broad real estate interests. Over the next half-century, Bryan would be a booster in the growth of the city. Sometime between 1856 and 1859, Bryan settled in Cottage Grove, Illinois (modern-day Elmhurst), building a 1,000 acre estate there named \\"Byrd's Nest\\". Bryan would ultimately play an important role in the development of the town, even being credited as the one responsible for renaming the town. Living there, he would commute daily to Chicago on the Chicago and North Western Railway. In the 1860 United States Census, Bryan was recorded to be the wealthiest person in DuPage County, Illinois, with a net worth said to exceed $325,000. In 1864, he would sell 26 acres of his land to his brother-in-law Jedediah Lathrop, where Lathrop built his own estate named Huntington. He and his wife Jennie had three children; two of whom (a son and a daughter) would live to adulthood. The son they lost as a child was named Daniel Page Bryan. Their adult son was Charles Page Bryan, who would have a career as a lawyer and diplomat. Their daughter was also named Jennie Byrd Bryan. She would become a prominent artist and philanthropist, and would marry John Barton Payne, adopting his surname. In 1860, Bryan established Graceland Cemetery. He was the inaugural president of the Graceland Cemetery Association. The year also saw the opening of Bryan Hall, a music hall which Bryan constructed in Chicago on Clark Street across from the city's courthouse. With a capacity of between 500 and 600 people, it was reported to be the largest hall of its kind in the metropolitan area at the time of its opening. It would remain the city's primary venue until the opening of Crosby's Opera House . Bryan established a reputation for himself as a gifted orator. Bryan was, twice, reluctantly a nominee for mayor of Chicago. In 1861, Bryan was the Democratic nominee for mayor of Chicago. He lost the election to Republican Julian Sidney Rumsey. He was the Republican nominee for the office in 1863, losing by an incredibly narrow margin to incumbent mayor Francis Cornwall Sherman. During the American Civil War, Bryan funded a company of the 105th Infantry Regiment of Illinois Volunteers in the Civil War, named the \\"Bryan's Blues\\". He was a member of the Union Defense Committee. He was also president of the Northwestern Sanitary Fair, an event held in 1865 along the Chicago lakefront which raised more than $270,000 for union soldiers. Bryan served in leadership roles for numerous Chicago organizations. From 1865 until 1906, Bryan served as president of the Chicago Soldiers' Home. He was president of the Union League Club of Chicago. In 1870, Bryan leased Bryan Hall to Richard M. Hooley for a period of five years, for $21,000 per year. It was renamed the Hooley Opera House. In 1871, Bryan and his wife Jennie gave 30 acres of land to the German Evangelical Synod of the Northwest for a seminary, which would eventually became Elmhurst College. In the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, Bryan lost $2 million, with one significant part of this being the loss of his music hall in the fire. After the fire, he provided a number of people displaced with refuge at Byrd's Nest. Bryan was involved in helping revive the city after the fire. Shortly before the fire Bryan had founded the Federal Savings Bank and Safe Depository, also known as the Fidelity Safe Deposity. Despite the burning of its building, the vaults and safes were intact, and their contents survived the fire. Bryan rebuilt a new structure for the institution quickly after the fire. He purchased the metal from the Chicago Court House Bell which he used to fashion an alarm for his company, selling the rest to H.S. Everhart & Company which commissioned the U.S. Mint to strike commemorative medals from the metal. From December 3, 1877 through July 1, 1878, Bryan served as Commissioner of the District of Columbia. Bryan around the time of the World's Columbian Exposition Bryan fell victim to what ultimately turned out to be scam run by H. H. Holmes, later discovered to be a serial killer. He lost more than $9,000 after becoming involved in Holmes's scam \\"A.B.C. Copier Company\\" at the advice of Bryan's associate Fred Nind. Holmes would fraudulently use Bryan's name on the papers of this and a number of other scam companies. Bryan was a leading figure in the effort to bring the World's Columbian Exposition to Chicago. Bryan convinced the Chicago City Council to pass legislation that would help the city in its efforts secure the world's fair. He, alongside Chicago mayor DeWitt Clinton Cregier and former Illinois Central Railroad president Edward Turner Jeffery gave the presentation for Chicago's bid to the fifteen member United States Senate committee that decided what location would be awarded the fair. After Chicago landed the fair, he was appointed a commissioner-at-large of the World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition Board created by federal legislation. He was ultimately the vice president of the World's Columbian Exposition, vice president World's Congress Auxiliary, Commissioner General of the Exposition and the Chairman of the Congresses Committee of Organization, and President of the World's Congress. ===Later years and death=== Bryan spent his later years living out East, in Virginia and Washington, D.C. Bryan was widowed in 1898. Bryan died January 26, 1906 in Washington, D.C. Bryan is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C. ==Patronage of George Peter Alexander Healy== Bryan commissioned many works by George Peter Alexander Healy. Healy had an acquaintanceship with Bryan. In 1857, Healy had purchased a cottage in Cottage Hill (Elmhurst) from Bryan, where his Healy lived for next six years, making them neighbors with Bryan during this period. After Bryan's death, many of the paintings that he had commissioned from Healy would pass to his daughter Jennie Byrd Payne. After her 1919 death, in 1920, Jennie Byrd's Payne's widowed husband, John Barton Payne, gifted a collection of forty masterpieces to the State of Virginia, a gift valued at time at over $1 million. In this gift were several paintings Bryan had commissioned from Healy. ==Collector of historic memorabilia== In his life, Bryan acquired several noteworthy pieces of historic memorabilia. After the Great Chicago Fire, Bryan purchased the broken remains of the bell from the city lost courthouse at an auction. He kept parts of the bell, but sold most of the bell's remains to H.S. Everhart & Company, who made one-inch tall miniature bells as souvenirs. The courthouse bell was notable in relation to the fire, as it had been one of the bells in the city that was rung to warn citizens of the fire. After notable people had been invited to send items to the Northwestern Sanitary Fair to auction, Abraham Lincoln sent the original draft of the Emancipation Proclamation. Bryan was successful in bidding for it, paying $3,000 for it, the item being the highest bid item on auction. Bryan had lithographic copies made and sold for the benefit of the Sanitary Commission. Bryan gifted the document to the Chicago Soldier's Home, who in turn entrusted it to the Chicago Historical Society for safekeeping. However, this original document was lost in the Great Chicago Fire. ==Gallery== ==References== Category:1828 births Category:1906 deaths Category:Illinois Democrats Category:Illinois Republicans Category:People from Elmhurst, Illinois Category:Politicians from Chicago Category:Illinois lawyers Category:Lawyers from Cincinnati Category:Barbour family Category:Washington, D.C.

The elections are notable for being the inaugural elections for district health board members. The elections were held on Saturday, 13 October, as prescribed in the Local Electoral Act 2001. ==Election date== The Local Electoral Act 2001 received ascent in May 2001. It stipulated under section 10 that \\"the next triennial general election of members of every local authority and community board is on 13 October 2001\\" and furthermore, that \\"a general election of members of every local authority, local board, or community board must be held on the second Saturday in October in every third year\\" thereafter. ==Voting system== The 2001 local elections were the last occasion when first-past-the-post voting (FPP) was used exclusively. From the 2004 elections onwards, territorial authorities and regional councils could choose between FPP and the single transferable vote (STV) method. District health board elections had to use STV from 2004 and were changed to at-large elections. ==District health boards== District health boards (DHBs) were established in January 2001 through the New Zealand Public Health and Disability Act 2000. At that time, the 21 DHBs had their boards appointed by the Minister of Health, Annette King. Each board has up to eleven members and seven of those are elected in local elections. As defined in section 7 of the Local Electoral Act 2001, board members for DHBs are to be elected as part of the local elections. The 2001 local elections were thus the inaugural elections for the country's then 21 DHBs. Elections were based on candidacies in local wards. ==Results== ===Mayoral elections=== Around 34 of the country's 74 mayoralties changed through the 2001 elections. The most notable contest happened in Auckland City, where John Banks ousted Christine Fletcher. Other cities that had their mayors unseated were Hamilton (David Braithwaite defeated Russ Rimmington) and Palmerston North (Mark Bell-Booth defeated Jill White). In Invercargill, Tim Shadbolt was returned unopposed. ===Other outcomes=== Of those who stood for election, 18 percent were declared elected unopposed. Spoiled votes made up 4.1 percent of the total votes. ==See also== * List of chairpersons of district health boards ==References== Local 2001 Local elections Category:October 2001 events in Oceania ","title":"2001 New Zealand local elections"},{"id":"63908739","text":"Robert Gehlmann Bone (June 2, 1906 ‚Äì January 13, 1991) was the ninth president of Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois. He was renowned for his leadership experience and welcoming nature. Bone became a staple of the Illinois State University culture by representing friendliness and generosity. He is memorialized on campus through the Hand of Friendship, a small stone statue dedicated to his time at the University. During Bone's presidency, the University grew from a small teacher's college into a large multidisciplinary university. Bone was able to gain funding for the development of residence halls, thus allowing more students to attend the school. He emphasized a reconstruction of several University facilities and sought to make the campus more student-friendly. On any given day, Bone could be seen taking a walk through campus and greeting every student by name, as he sought to make Illinois State a welcoming and inclusive environment. == Early life == Robert Gehlmann Bone was born in Springfield, Illinois on June 2, 1906. His father, Eugene E. Bone, worked as a court judge in Springfield for many years. Robert Bone was educated in the public school system surrounding Springfield, completing his high school education there. The Bone family, more famously, neighbored United States' soon-to-be President, Abraham Lincoln. Robert's grandparents were familiar with the family and spent time with them during their residency in Springfield. == Education == Post-high school, Bone attended the College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio. He pursued a major in history, with a minor in political science. He graduated with honors, and later went on to pursue a Master's and PhD program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His studies there were momentarily interrupted by his service in the Army Air Corps during World War II, but he later returned to finish his degree in 1932. During these years, he traveled the world extensively, seeing parts of Europe, North Africa, and Southwest Asia. He lived in both Egypt and France for nearly a year, and gained his first teaching experience in Alexandria, Egypt (at the American School of Alexandria). There, he taught both law and English, and eventually became director of their acting classes. == Leadership == After he gained experience in Egypt (ending in 1931), Bone became a history and speech professor at Lincoln College in Lincoln, Illinois. Eventually, he became acting dean of the faculty there. In 1934, he was offered a new position at the University of Illinois, taking over for an Ancient History professor who was going on leave. This position granted him \\"The Gold Tablet\\", a prize designated to the most effective professors by University students. He remained at the University of Illinois until his leave for the army. In 1942, he was sent overseas and gained a position in the Headquarters Staff of the U.S. Forces in Europe. He eventually helped to found American University in Shrivenham, England, and became head of its History department throughout the school's existence. Upon return, he continued to work at the University of Illinois until the 1950's, and was dubbed the Director of the Division of General Studies in 1946. He was also one of five staff members designated to help counsel students when services were running low. In 1947, he was again named the Director of the Division of Special Services, but resigned from this position in 1952. He went back to his original position in General Studies during that same year. During this time, he also became the Acting Dean of the College of Education, a stance which he held until 1953. In 1954, he became Assistant Provost of the University, and held on to that position for the remainder of his time. Bone held many elected offices outside of academia. He also became active in the Student Affairs Committee, as well as the Student Senate. He became chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs, and the Senate Committee on Committees, which was elected by the University Senate. Likewise, he was elected to work on the Liberal Arts and Sciences Committee, as well as the Advisory Committee, at the University. Outside of these, he ran study groups for students and ran conferences on education quality. Outside of campus, Bone was an active member of the American Historical Association and the Illinois State Historical Society. He served on the local Board of Directions for the Archaeological Institute of America. He also was highly active on the Board of several local fraternities, while also serving for the local YMCA. === Illinois State Normal University === Robert Gehlmann Bone became the ninth president of Illinois State Normal University (now Illinois State University). He was inaugurated in 1956 and served until 1967. During his time at Illinois State, he was responsible for much of the construction done to revamp all ends of campus. His presidency initiated the expansion of the South campus to include Tri-Towers residential halls, Hamilton-Whitten and Atkin-Colby buildings, and a new and improved Cardinal Court residential complex. Likewise, the Hancock Stadium and Horton Field House were expanded. These structures were initially going to be deconstructed, but instead were revamped to make use of existing parking lots, as well as to accommodate the growing University population. The development of these new buildings provided students with more housing and accessibility to the central area of campus. The construction of more housing allowed expansion of the University's enrollment, an initiative attempted by many other presidents to follow. During previous president Raymond W. Fairchild's term, a new art building was in the making. However, it was not completely planned or finished until Bone's presidency. The new structure was to house the theater, speech, and music departments. It would consist of two separate buildings conjoined by an atrium: Centennial East, and Centennial West. Three different performance centers were constructed inside these buildings, for performances and practices. Bone also worked to change the school's name from Illinois State Normal University to just Illinois State University, as it is commonly known today. This occurred on January 1, 1967, after a trial run with the moniker Illinois State University at Normal. This name change coincided with the reorganization of academic departments in 1966. The University adopted the College of Education, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the College of Applied Science and Technology, a stark contrast from its prior department- based structure. === Death === Robert Gehlmann Bone died on January 13, 1991, at 84 years old. He passed away at his home in Normal. He was survived by his wife and two sons. Services were held on Illinois State University campus. His loss was mourned by staff and students as his remarkable impact on residential life was remembered. == Legacy == === Hand of Friendship === The Hand of Friendship is a commemorative statue donated to Robert Bone by the Illinois State University class of 1967. This was shortly after his resignation that same year. The Hand of Friendship was meant to represent the selfless nature of Bone's presidency, and his tendency to act for the greater good of the academic community. The statue still stands today on Illinois State University's main campus. === Bone Student Center === The Bone Student Center (originally the University Union) is an on-campus communal space that was renamed to honor Bone in 1982, at the University's 125th anniversary ceremony. The space is still used today by students, and offers a variety of study spaces, dining options, and other scholastic resources. == Sources == Category:1906 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Presidents of Illinois State University Category:People from Springfield, Illinois Category:College of Wooster alumni Category:University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign alumni Category:University of Illinois faculty ","title":"Robert Gehlmann Bone"},{"id":"63908742","text":"Joseph Ampah Kojo Essel was a Ghanaian Member of Parliament for the Dompim constituency from 1965 to 1966. ==Early life== Essel was born in 1921 at Sefwi-Bekwai in the Western Region of Ghana (then Gold Coast). He had his Middle School education at the Sefwi-Wiawso Government Middle School where he obtained his Standard Seven Certificate in 1937. He entered Wesley College, Kumasi in 1938 but transferred to Adisadel College a year later. His stay at Adisadel College was however, truncated in 1940 when his guardian died. ==Career and politics== Essel begun his career in 1942 with the Gold Coast Army as a trained mechanic at the Base Workshops in Accra. He worked with the army until 1946. A year later, he obtained employment as a mechanic with C. F. A. O. in Kumasi. That same year he quit his career as a mechanic to enter the cocoa buying trade. He became a licensed cocoa buying agent under one Opanyin Adofoasa of Ntroso in the Brong Ahafo Region during the main season of 1947 and 1948. In 1949 he left the job to become a petty trader.

Buckler is a plant geneticist with the USDA Agricultural Research Service and holds an adjunct appointment at Cornell University. His work focuses on both quantitative and statistical genetics in maize as well as other crops such as cassava. He originated the concept of Nested association mapping and created the first population designed for this type of quantitative genetic analysis. Buckler was elected an American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow in 2012. In 2014, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 2017, he received the NAS prize in Food and Agricultural Science for his work using natural genetic diversity to develop varieties of maize with fifteen more vitamin A than existing varieties. == Career == Buckler spent his childhood in Arlington, Virginia where his mother worked as a microbiologist and his father worked for the US Navy. He is dyslexic and didn't read until the second grade. He attended the University of Virginia where he majored in both biology and archaeology. After graduation he moved to the University of Missouri where he studied maize domestication and molecular evolution under Timothy Holtsford, met his wife, and graduated with his PhD in 1997. He postdoc'ed at North Carolina State University with Bruce Weir and Michael Purugganan. He joined the USDA as a geneticist in 1998 and since 2003 has been stationed in Ithaca, NY and associated with Cornell University. In 2014 Buckler hosted Bill Gates during a visit to Cornell associated with Gates' support for developing improved cassava varieties. == Nested Association Mapping == Nested Association Mapping (NAM) was devised as an approach to combine the advantages of linkage mapping with structured populations and association mapping with natural populations while limiting their respective drawback. Buckler began developing the initial maize Nested Association Mapping population in 2002, using twenty five maize inbreds selected to capture as many of the alleles present in the species as possible and crossing each to a common parent to generate 5,000 inbred lines (200 per family), ultimately capturing more than 100,000 genetic crossovers.Yu, J., Holland, J. B., McMullen, M. D., & Buckler, E. S. (2008). Genetic design and statistical power of nested association mapping in maize. Genetics, 178(1), 539-551. Buckler's lab released the inbreds as well as the first study using them to map loci controlling a phenotype (flowering time) in 2009.Buckler, E. S., Holland, J. B., Bradbury, P. J., Acharya, C.

The WaNPRC is part of a network of seven National Primate Research Centers which conduct biomedical research on primates. The center opened in 1961, and as of 2020, houses over 500 primates.. ==Research Facilities== The WaNPRC is headquartered in the Warren G. Magnuson Health Sciences Center on the University of Washington's Seattle campus. In addition, the center leases facilities in the South Lake Union and Belltown neighborhoods of Seattle. Research at the center is conducted by a group of core staff scientists, as well as over 400 affiliate scientists. ==Breeding colonies== The WaNPRC operates three breeding colonies: one in Seattle (southern pig-tailed macaques), one in Louisiana (southern pig-tailed macaques and rhesus macaques), and one in Arizona (pigtail macaques). =Incidents and controversies= The WaNPRC has been at the center of several controversies and breaches of protocol, which have resulted in the deaths of various primates. These events have led to fines and citations by the USDA. == Pre-2000 == In 1995, five baboons died of exposure and thirst at UW's breeding center in Spokane. == 2000s == In 2008, the NIH revealed that researchers at UW had performed several unauthorized surgeries on monkeys. The investigation revealed that five UW researchers had performed 41 unauthorized surgeries on 14 monkeys. Komo news also reported that the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) had ignored warnings about these sorts of issues. In 2009, a primate starved to death in UW's captivity, which resulted in a USDA fine of $10,893. == 2010s == From May to June 2013, there were three separate incidents of young macaques being attacked and killed by adult macaques. On May 2, a 1-month old macaque was severely injured shortly after it and its mother were introduced to a group of other macaques. The infant was then euthanized. On May 30, a 6-month old macaque was attacked by the adult male in its group and died. On June 12, a 9-month old macaque was attacked by an adult male and had to be euthanized. In July 2015, a USDA inspection revealed that the center's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) had approved three protocols with incomplete descriptions, one of which led three primates having severe health issues and having to be euthanized. The first protocol involved surgical incisions, but did not provide information about the length or location of the incisions. The second protocol involved skull, arm, and vertebral implants, but lacked information about the size and location of the incisions, as well as what type of instrumentation was to be implanted. As a result, three of the primates used in this protocol had severe health issues and had to be euthanized. The third protocol involved skull implants, but lacked a description of the size and locations of the implants. It was noted in the report that one primate in this study had been subjected to surgery on a large portion of its skull, and as a result, the animal's eyebrow appeared to be depressed. On December 12, 2016, a primate died under anesthesia during an MRI-related procedure. It was revealed that anesthetic monitoring records were not kept during the surgery, which prompted a review that revealed that anesthetic methods for MRI procedures were partially incomplete over the last year. On January 17, 2017, an 8-year-old female pigtail macaque died of dehydration as the result of the water line in its cage being disconnected for two to three days. This incident was partially the result of the WaNPRC not having cleaned or sanitized the macaque's cage for 17 days prior to the incident. If the cage had been cleaned every two weeks, as is required, it is believed that the disconnected water line would have been discovered, and the death would not have happened. In April 2018, a pigtail macaque accidentally strangled itself using a chain adjacent to its cage. The USDA reported that the chain was not installed properly. The macaque's social partner witnessed the death. In 2019, a primate died during surgery due to the fact that it had not been fasted prior to surgery. As a result, the animal vomited and choked to death. In 2019, a drug vial was found to be diluted, which resulted in a primate possibly receiving less than the recommended dose of analgesic. This may have resulted in the animal experiencing pain during surgery. As a result, the employee responsible for the incident was fired. Additionally, an inspection discovered that a controlled drug cabinet had been left open and unattended with a key in the lock. ==See also== *Animal testing at the University of Washington ==References== ==External links== *WaNPRC home page Category:Primate research centers Category:Animal testing on non-human primates Category:University of Washington Category:Organizations established in 1961 Category:Research institutes in Seattle Category:Medical research institutes in the United States Category:Biomedical research foundations ","title":"Washington National Primate Research Center"},{"id":"63908990","text":"Yuliya Larionova (born 18 August 1984) is an Azerbaijani football referee and a former player who played as a forward.

She is known for teasing out ideas about contemporary abstraction in her art and writing, particularly a style she called \\"new casualism\\" in a 2011 essay. Butler uses process as metaphor and has said in artist's talks that she is keenly interested in creating paintings as documentation of her life.In a 2014 review in the Washington Post, art critic Michael Sullivan wrote that Butler \\"creates sketchy, thinly painted washes that hover between representation and abstraction.Though boasting such mechanistic titles as 'Tower Vents' and 'Turbine Study,' Butler‚Äôs dreamlike renderings, which use tape to only suggest the roughest outlines of architectural forms, feel like bittersweet homages to urban decay.\\" Critic Thomas Micchelli proposed that Butler's work shares \\"Rauschenberg‚Äôs dissolution of the barriers between painting and sculpture,\\" particularly where the canvases are \\"stapled almost willy-nilly to the front of the stretcher bars, which are visible along the edges of some of the works.\\" Since 2016, her canvases have been based on small daily drawings that she made each day (2016-2020) in a phone app and posted on Instagram. In a 2018 conversation about the process of making paintings from these diminutive digital images, she said that the sense of surface and touch are inherent to a painting must be invented in the digital space. The images are never what they seem, especially when viewed on the phone.\\" == Early life and education == Butler was born in New London, Connecticut, and moved to New York City in the late 1980s. She has a B.A. in Art History from Tufts University (Medford, MA), a B.F.A. in Painting from Massachusetts College of Art (Boston, MA), and an M.F.A. in Art from the University of Connecticut (Storrs, CT). == Exhibitions == Butler has shown her work internationally at galleries in Baltimore, Brooklyn, Boston, Chicago, Miami, London, Los Angeles, Paris, New York, Seattle, and other cities. In 2014, she was the inaugural resident at Counterproof Press where she published a series of etchings that foreshadowed her interest in geometric drawing. Theodore:Art (Brooklyn, NY), Pocket Utopia (New York, NY), and SEASON (Seattle, WA) are among the galleries with whom Butler has been affiliated. Her work is in collections at the William Benton Museum of Art (Storrs, CT), Eastern Connecticut State University (Willimantic CT), Southern New Hampshire University, and has been published in the Harvard Review. == Arts writing == Butler is an arts writer. In 2007 she founded Two Coats of Paint, which was among the first of the professional art blogs developed by artists. Two Coats of Paint was named one of the best art blogs in New York by Time Out. It was awarded several grants, including the Creative Capital / Andy Warhol Foundation Arts Writers Grant (2013) for art blogs. The project has expanded to include a small press, curatorial projects, and an artists' residency program. Her essays have been published in The Brooklyn Rail, Gulf Coast, Huffington Post, Hyperallergic, The American Prospect, and other publications. Through her lectures and teaching, she has encouraged artists to contribute to the art community by organizing salons, residency programs, curating exhibitions, writing art criticism, and other activities that provide opportunities to other artists. == Casualism == In 2011, in a essay called Abstract Painting: The New Casualists, published in The Brooklyn Rail, Butler coined the term \\"casualism\\" for a new type of abstraction that featured a self-amused, anti-heroic style with an interest in off-kilter composition and impermanence. She suggested that artists' interest in irresolution reflected wider insights about culture and society. Many younger artists responded positively to the essay, embracing the notion of \\"casualism,\\" while others rejected the term, suggesting it \\"whiffed of 'labelism,' and 'crypto-institutionalism.'\\" Subsequent interviews and art reviews of Butler's own work made clear that ideas for the original article were rooted in her own painting practice and artist statement. The Casualist tendency continued to inform her work for many years, although she eventually returned to more traditional stretched-canvas formats. == Awards and residencies == Butler has been awarded the Pollock Krasner Foundation Grant (1991), and the Creative Capital/ Andy Warhol Foundation Arts Writing Program Grant for Art Blogs (2013, with follow-up grant in 2016). She has also received residencies from Art21 (PBS affiliate), New York, NY (2009), Counterproof Press (2014), Yaddo (2015, 2018), and the Cultural Space Subsidy Program (2015-2018, 2019-2021). == References == Category:1959 births Category:American art writers Category:21st-century American painters Category:Living people Category:American abstract artists Category:Minimalist artists Category:Abstract painters Category:21st-century American women artists Category:American contemporary painters Category:Casualist artists ","title":"Sharon Butler"},{"id":"63909177","text":"Jan Muscenius, (Jan Muszcze≈Ñski alias Jan Mucha, 1532 ‚Äì 21 July 1602) was a Polish astronomer, theologian, and the rector of Krak√≥w Academy (now Jagiellonian University).. == Life == Jan Muscenius was born in Kurzel√≥w, Sandomierz Province, and lived in Krak√≥w.

Testing is performed by faculty from various departments across the university, and is conducted on animals including dogs, rabbits, primates, pigs, sheep, gerbils, bobcats, ferrets, and coyotes. Testing on primates is done through the Washington National Primate Research Center, which is located on campus. Animal testing at UW is overseen by the university's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). ==Primate testing== ==Use of live pigs== ===Paramedic training=== UW uses live pigs to train paramedics to perform a surgical airway procedure, in which a person's neck is cut into to create an emergency airway. This practice has received criticism from various individuals and organizations, including the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM), members of the Washington House of Representatives, UW students, and paramedic Cindy Coker. The PCRM reported that each year UW uses 20-40 pigs for this training, after which the pigs are euthanized. In January 2017, eight members of the Washington House of Representatives sent a letter to UW asking them to consider replacing the procedures on pigs with other methods. ===Surgical training=== In 2019, UW's medical school resumed using live pigs for surgical training after a five-year hiatus. This decision was criticized by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine as well as UW professor Lisa Jones-Engel. ==Incidents and controversies== From 2011 to 2012, a member of a research time failed to give a group of thirty rabbits proper pain relief medication. On February 5, 2013, the same person breached protocol by improperly administering another rabbit anesthesia during surgery. In 2013, a rabbit was discovered to have a fractured pelvis that resulted in paralysis and euthanasia. Although the lab claimed to have no explanation of what happened, it was discovered that a technician had handled the animal the previous day, and a necropsy suggested that the injury occurred on that day. In February 2014, the USDA found that a guinea pig had died after not receiving proper pain relief for a surgery three days prior. ==Animal Research and Care Facility (ARCF)== A significant amount of animal testing at UW takes place at the Animal Research and Care Facility (ARCF), which is located at the south end of UW Seattle's campus on NE Pacific St. ===Development=== On November 14, 2013, UW's Board of Regents unanimously approved plans for a new animal testing lab. The facility was initially budgeted at $123.5 million. In January 2017, the Board of Regents approved an additional $18.5 million to finish construction. Development of the lab was protested by animal rights activists. Several protests occurred during construction of the lab, with a large protest of about 500 people occurring on April 25, 2015. In 2015, it was revealed by a King County Superior Court case that UW's governing board, the Board of Regents, violated Washington's Open Public Meetings Act law by discussing the new animal lab at the UW president's home. The judge determined that the Board of Regents violated the law on 24 occasions from 2012 to 2014, by discussing the animal lab and other business over dinner. ==See also== *Washington National Primate Research Center ==References== ==External links== *Animal Research and Care Facility (ARCF) Homepage *UW Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) Homepage Category:Animal testing Category:Animal testing in the United States Category:University of Washington ","title":"Animal testing at the University of Washington"},{"id":"63909217","text":"The flag of El Paso is the official municipal flag of El Paso, Texas. The current design, an augmentation of El Paso's seal in the center of a dark blue field, has been in place since 1962. ==Design and symbolism== In the center of the emblem is a silver five-pointed star, representing faith. The left half of each point is shaded a darker color, giving the star a three-dimensional appearance. The star's design, not the color, is the exact used on the seal and coat of arms of Texas. Completely surrounding the star is a bright yellow sun with 35 equal rays. This represents El Paso's nickname of \\"The Sun City\\", as the sun shines about 302 days a year on average. The sun is on a maroon (officially \\"red-purple\\") field, representing fellowship, warmth, and shelter. A narrow white border encircles the field. This is also the inner border of a maroon ring. Green olive leaves occupy the left and right sides of this ring, with the green meaning hope, good fortune, fertile land, and vitality. A wide heraldic ribbon is above the ring, with a white front and maroon back. On the ribbon is the text \\"CITY OF EL PASO\\" in maroon capital Arial-type font. A shorter ribbon of the same style is on the bottom of the flag, this time with the word \\"TEXAS\\". Connecting these ribbons is a thin white border, forming the outer edge of the olive leaf ring. The white within the emblem represents purity. The emblem is centered on a blue field, which represents sincerity. In terms of measurements, the total flag's proportions are 3 by 5. The drawing accompanying the official ordinance recognizing the adoption of the flag described the emblem as positioned 17 inches from the hoist and fly sides and 6 inches from the top and bottom. The emblem measures 26 inches horizontally and 24 inches vertically. ==History== The emblem on the flag was created around 1880, and was enclosed in a cornerstone at the old El Paso City Hall in 1899. The old city hall was demolished in 1958 to clear space for a new building, and the emblem was recovered. === First flag === First flag of El Paso, using the correct seal in the center Crest used on the flag, now the current seal of El Paso The city first adopted a flag on June 17, 1948. The specification of its design was as follows: The flag was manufactured in a 5:8 ratio. The manufacturer, however, did not use the official city seal on the flag. They instead used a modified version of Texas' state seal, replacing \\"THE STATE OF TEXAS\\" with \\"THE CITY OF EL PASO\\". This emblem was used often on city documents, officially known as the city crest prior to the adoption of the flag. It wasn't until 1960 when the Girl Scouts noticed this discrepancy, as they were looking to embroider a new flag. It appears that the crest used on the flag is now the current seal of El Paso. With the adoption of a new flag 2 years later the issue was noticed, the first flag of El Paso was technically never used. === Second flag === Following the Girl Scouts' discovery, the city administration decided to redesign the flag, which would be more authentic historically. The city planning department designed the flag and it was officially adopted on March 29, 1962. A 2004 North American Vexillological Association survey of 150 American city flags ranked El Paso's flag 91st. Out of Texas city flags in the same survey, the flag ranked 11th out of 12. Only the flag of Lubbock ranked lower, a design which has since been changed. A 2015 El Paso Times opinion piece called on the city to redesign the flag, even providing an alternative, with the yellow sun centered on a blue field, with a blue five-pointed star in the middle. ==References== Category:Flags of cities in Texas Flag Category:Flags of Texas Category:Flags introduced in 1962 ","title":"Flag of El Paso"},{"id":"63909230","text":"The Greenville Greenies was the primary moniker of the minor league baseball franchise based in Greenville, North Carolina.

At the age of 33, he suffered a broken neck which left him paralyzed after a diving accident. His story was chronicled in the book, Head Strong: How a Broken Neck Strengthened My Spirit. ==Early Life and Education== Fedor was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. He attended Saint Ignatius High School and then Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in finance and a minor in Mandarin Chinese. Fedor later earned a Master of Business Administration in marketing from the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. ==Injury and Recovery== On July 3, 2009, Fedor suffered a complete spinal cord injury (SCI) when he broke his neck after he dove off a cottage pier into shallow water at Coldwater Lake in Michigan. He broke his C1-C6 vertebrae upon impact and severed his spinal cord at the C3 level. Fedor floated face down in the water, unable to breathe or move, and ultimately drowned before he was rescued by others. He was transported by air ambulance to Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo, Michigan where doctors determined that Fedor was paralyzed from the neck down. He was placed on a ventilator to allow him to breathe, since he was unable to do so on his own. Scott was told he would never walk again and would need the ventilator for the rest of his life. Because of this, Michigan Death with Dignity laws required Fedor be given the option to end his life. After a few weeks he was transferred to Cleveland‚Äôs MetroHealth Medical Center, one of fourteen SCI Model Care System hospitals in the country. Months after his injury, Fedor became the 250th person to be implanted with a diaphragmatic pacer device that allowed him to breathe without the use of a ventilator. He was eventually able to learn to breathe on his own without the diaphragmatic pacer device. Fedor eventually became the fourteenth person in the world to be implanted with a Spinal Cough Assist System that allowed him to cough on his own and clear any secretions that might lead to pneumonia. In 2010 Fedor worked to help change Ohio laws regarding the types of animals an individual can own and subsequently Helping Hands, a Massachusettes-based organization that trains and places helper monkeys with individuals with spinal cord injuries and limited mobility since 1979, matched Fedor with a capuchin monkey named Melanie. Melanie has her own following on Instagram. Fedor is one of the higher-injured recipients who Helping Hands has placed a service monkey with. ==Speaking and Writing== As a result of his injury, Fedor became a motivational speaker. In 2015 he gave the keynote address at ADA Cleveland for the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Fedor has spoken at conferences and organizations across the United States. He routinely speaks to Fortune 500 corporations, colleges, high schools, and faith-based organizations. He speaks on the topics of navigating change, the power of a positive attitude, perseverance through difficult times, and faith in the face of adversity. In October 2013, Boys Hope Girls Hope recognized Fedor with its Rising Pillar of Hope Award. His articles have been published in various media outlets across the country, including ‚ÄúU.S. News & World Report‚Äù. Fedor is the author of Head Strong: How a Broken Neck Strengthened My Spirit. The book was published by Coyote Crest in July 2019 on the tenth anniversary of his spinal cord injury. ==Advocacy== In 2011, Fedor founded Getting Back Up, a nonprofit organization that provides individuals with spinal cord injuries funding for exercise-based recovery programs and adaptable products. He is an advocate member of The Adversity 2 Advocacy Alliance, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting and fostering the power of turning personal adversity into service to others with similar challenges. Fedor serves on the Board of Directors for Linking Employment, Abilities and Potential (LEAP), a nonprofit organization whose mission is to advance participation and equality in society for people with disabilities. ==Professional Career== At the time of his injury, Fedor was a vice president for Halex, a Scott Fetzer Company and Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary. Prior to Halex, Fedor worked at Trex, Newell Rubbermaid, and Aptiv (formally Delphi Automotive). ==Personal Life== Scott Fedor married Kristy Costell on June 9, 2007.

James- Alexandre de Pourtal√®s, Comte de Pourtal√®s-Gorgier (28 November 1776 ‚Äì 24 March 1855) was a Swiss-French banker, diplomat and art collector. ==Early life== The Count de Pourtal√®s was born in Neuch√¢tel, then in the Principality of Neuch√¢tel under Prussian rule, into a large family of Protestant financiers on 28 November 1776. He was the son of Countess Rose Augustine Marie de Luze (1751‚Äì1791) and Jacques-Louis de Pourtal√®s (1722‚Äì1814), a banker in Naples who amassed a fortune in commerce and was made a count by King Frederick William II. Among his siblings were Louis de Pourtal√®s (husband of Sophie d'Audanger) and Fr√©d√©ric de Pourtal√®s (husband of Marie Louise de Castellane and grandfather of Friedrich von Pourtal√®s). His paternal grandparents were J√©r√©mie de Pourtal√®s and Marguerite de Luze (who was the younger sister of his maternal great-grandfather). The Pourtal√®s family were French Huguenots who settled in Neuch√¢tel following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. His maternal grandparents were the former Marianne-Fran√ßoise Warney (a niece of Daniel Roguin of Yverdon) and Baron Jean-Jacques III de Luze, a prosperous textile manufacturer at Colombier and were both friends of writer and philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau.. They had an elegant country house near the governor's ch√¢teau in what was then the principality of Neuch√¢tel. ==Career== Ch√¢teau de Gorgier. In 1813, he acquired the seigneury of Gorgier, which he added to the family name, from Charles Henry, Vicomte de Gorgier. He served as Chamberlain to the King of Prussia and was awarded the title of Count on 20 November 1814 by King Frederick William III, who ruled Prussia during the Napoleonic Wars and the end of the Holy Roman Empire. Pourtal√®s freed the B√©rochaux from cartage chores in 1822 and, in recognition, received a bench with his coat of arms at the church. From 1816 to 1829, he was a member of the General Audiences. ===Residences and art collection=== The Laughing Cavalier by Frans Hals, which was owned by Pourtal√®s.Pourtal√®s' Head of Apollo, that was once in the collection of Vincenzo Giustiniani. In 1815, he settled in Paris before residing in a mansion in the Place Vend√¥me in the 1st arrondissement of Paris. Between 1838 and 1839, Pourtal√®s had F√©lix Duban build the Pourtal√®s mansion, a h√¥tel particulier (essentially a grand townhouse) on Rue Tronchet in the 6th arrondissement of Lyon. At his mansion, Pourtal√®s assembled one of the most important collections of antiques and paintings of his time, including the Laughing Cavalier by Frans Hals and works by Bronzino, Rembrandt, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and a Sandro Botticelli portrait. In 1825, he donated a mummy and coffin he acquired from the Thedenat-Duvent sale, to the Berlin Museum. In February and March 1865, ten years after his death, his collection was auctioned off in Paris in accordance with his will. The majority of his collection was photographed and published in a large folio by Goupil & Cie. The Laughing Cavalier was purchased by the Marquess of Hertford (who outbid Baron de Rothschild). Lord Amherst bought some of the important Egyptian objects. Sir Charles Newton spent 60,919 francs on bronzes and vases for the British Museum, and 47,000 francs on Giustiniani's Apollo. In 1806, he purchased the Ch√¢teau de Bandeville in Saint-Cyr-sous-Dourdan where, in 1833, he had the English-style park redeveloped by landscape designer Louis-Sulpice Var√©, in one of the first known works. Today, Var√© is known for his French landscape gardens at several famous chateaux, including the Ch√¢teau de Ch√¢tenay-en-France, and the Bois de Boulogne park. In 1809, he also acquired Ch√¢teau de Luins in the Swiss Canton of Vaud for 150,000 Swiss francs. The estate passed to his eldest daughter and her husband, the Marquis de Ganay, and their family. ==Personal life== On 12 June 1809, he was married to Anne Henriette de Pal√©zieux-Falconnet (1792‚Äì1836) in Neuch√¢tel. His wife was a daughter of banker Jean Louis de Pal√©zieux- Falconnet and the former Anna Hunter, an American who was the sister of William Hunter, a U.S. Senator from Newport, Rhode Island. His wife's sister, Eliza Augusta, married the American archeologist and artist John Izard Middleton.

It is located close to the Arena, a well-preserved 1st century AD Roman amphitheatre. The present Baroque building was constructed between 1627 and 1683 on the site of an earlier Romanesque church which had existed since the 12th century or earlier. The church's fa√ßade remained incomplete until the neoclassical fa√ßade of the church of San Sebastiano was relocated to San Nicol√≤ in the 1950s, after the former church was destroyed during World War II. ==History== The rear of the church as viewed from inside the Verona Arena The earliest known reference to San Nicol√≤ all'Arena dates back to the 12th century, when a Romanesque church known as San Nicholai de Buchadarena stood on its site. The building got its name from its proximity to the Roman Arena, and it is believed to have been a parish church by 1336. Some relics which included the remains of martyrs were discovered inside the building in 1519. The church and the surrounding area were acquired by the Theatines in 1598, who made plans to reconstruct the church and build a monastery. It ceased to be a parish church in 1603. Reconstruction began on 21 March 1627 to designs of the architect Lellio Pellesina and the Romanesque church was demolished in 1630, but during that year work was interrupted due to a plague outbreak. After the plague ended, a crypt dedicated to Christ the Redeemer was built within the church to commemorate deliverance from the outbreak. Construction of the crypt began on 15 March 1631 and it was completed in 1640. The church itself was finished in 1683, although the planned dome was never built and the stone cladding on the fa√ßade was never installed. It was consecrated by the bishop Pietro Leoni in 1697. Ruins of the church of San Sebastiano in 1946, before its fa√ßade was relocated to San Nicol√≤ all'Arena In 1806, during Napoleonic rule, the Theatines were evicted from the church. It became a parish church once again in 1810. The fa√ßade remained incomplete until the mid-20th century, when the fa√ßade of the church of San Sebastiano was relocated to San Nicol√≤ all'Arena. San Sebastiano had been bombed during World War II, and its fa√ßade (which had been completed in 1830 by the architect ) was dismantled and rebuilt at the new location between 1951 and 1953. During the relocation, some changes had to be made to the fa√ßade to accommodate for the larger dimensions of San Nicol√≤ all'Arena, including the construction of a concrete tympanum. Restoration work in the nave and transept were carried out in 1998 and 1999 under the direction of the architect Oreste Valdinoci. In 2001, a ramp was added to the side entrance by the architect Paola Bogoni in order to improve accessibility. Restoration of the internal flooring was carried out between 2001 and 2002 by the architect Massimiliano Valdinoci, and the church's interior and exterior were consolidated and restored between 2012 and 2015 by the architect Giovanni Castiglioni. ==Architecture== presbytery The trompe-l'≈ìil painting of the dome The present church is built in the Baroque style, while the relocated fa√ßade is neoclassical. The latter has four fluted Ionic columns of a giant order which support a triangular tympanum. The main doorway is located in the centre, and this is surmounted by an inscription which reads D.O.M. IN HONOREM S. NICOLAI EPISCOPI. There are two smaller portals which are surmounted by pediments, and above them there are empty niches and decorations of festoons. The church is built out of brick and stone. It has a cruciform plan with a single nave and side chapels, a short transept and a deep presbytery. One of the chapels has the painting San Giovanni Battista nel deserto (St John the Baptist in the desert) by Antonio Balestra as its altarpiece. Below the presbytery there is the crypt which has three naves with barrel vaulted roofs separated by rows of low arches supported by pillars. The church has a bell tower which is located at the rear of the building near the sacristy. This is low and stocky, and it was never completed since a large bell tower would have had a negative visual impact on the nearby Arena. A dome was planned for the building but this was never built, and in its place there is a flat ceiling with a trompe-l'≈ìil simulating a dome. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== Nicolo all'Arena Category:Romanesque architecture in Verona Category:Baroque architecture in Verona Category:Neoclassical architecture in Verona Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1683 Category:Relocated buildings and structures Category:Theatine churches ","title":"San Nicol√≤ all'Arena, Verona"},{"id":"63909333","text":"Ebony Repertory Theatre Ebony Repertory Theatre (ERT) is a non-profit theatre company founded in June 2007 by Wren T.

It was published in 1952 by Alfred A. Knopf. == Plot == The rarefied, bucolic lives of Sam and Sarah Dunn are disturbed by the uncanny pronouncements of their cousin, Peter Cowley. Sara, a sophisticated sculptress, and the languorous Samuel, whose wealth and lifestyle have driven him to a state of perpetual ennui, are caught off-guard by their young relative's report of an ecstatic, mystical vision. Cowley, who has been invited to run a small vacation school for children in the spacious grounds of their substantial summer home, claims to have experienced the vision on a hillside nearby. His pronouncement is the cause of much discussion and consternation among the adults present: Julie McMoon, a neighbour of the Dunns who is grieving the recent suicide of her husband, and whose children are attending the summer school; the cynical pianist, Richard Lundrigan, who will spend much of the novel attempting to convince Cowley that his vision was a fantasy; and Thomas Lavender, a highly enthusiastic, if not slightly crazed, minister, who has joined the vacation in his capacity as Cowley's spiritual director, and is convinced of the veracity of his prot√©g√©'s mystical experience. Also party to Cowley's mysterious claims are his students, Ellie Sonntag, Daisy and Timmy McMoon, George Bundle, Fendall Dunn, Rufus Este, and Harry Fogg. The two oldest of the children, Harry and Rufus, separate themselves from both the adults and their classmates by designating themselves as ‚Äòthe Uglies‚Äô, a nickname representative of their adolescent sense of discomfort and lack of belonging. This angst is further expressed through their close observation and discussion of those around them, their overt demonstrations of their own intelligence in Cowley's classroom, and their composition of poetry. When Cowley takes the children to a local carnival and they pile into a tent to watch a ‚Äòfreak show‚Äô the Uglies laugh at, but also feel a deep sense of kinship with, the performers. The excursion ends awkwardly when a dwarf interrupts the performance to challenge the attitude of one of the children, who immediately begins to cry. Convinced of the significance of his vision, both for himself and for the rest of the adults at the house, Cowley encourages them to return with him to the hillside in the hope that the phenomena will repeat itself. Upon arriving at the spot, the group are momentarily caught unawares by the appearance of a shimmering angelic assembly. The vision, however, is revealed to be the children, who, on overhearing that the adults intend to seek the miraculous, have decided to play a trick on them, enlisting the help of Sara's model, Mollie Purdue, and dressing themselves in white sheets. Lavender is convinced that the children are endowed with a purity and joy that the adults have foolishly exchanged for a cynical and narrow view of the world. At the close of the novel the ageing minister's desire to partake of that innocence manifests itself in ways both strange and tragic, first in his performance of a bizarre marriage ceremony, wedding the children to one another, and then in his fatal fall from their tree house. == Characters == * Peter Cowley: a relative of the Dunn family, Cowley is a saint-like, though also somewhat comic figure, who shares the innocence of the children he is employed to tutor. Dale Brown comments that Cowley is ‚Äòvulnerable to life in a fragile, frightening way‚Äô, positing him as somewhere between a ‚Äòsaint‚Äô and a ‚Äòmadman‚Äô. * Samuel Dunn: Seventeenth and eighteenth-century literature and art are the main pastime for the listless and apathetic Samuel, whose wealth and privilege have rendered him irredeemably passive ‚Äì so much so that, at the climax of the novel, he falls asleep. * Sara Dunn: A talented sculptor, Sarah is likewise effected by the ennui brought by wealth and status, though, unlike her husband, she is not reduced to passivity. Rather, she engages passionately both in the discussion around Cowley's vision and in her work. * Julie McMoon: A wealthy neighbour of the Dunn family, Julie is labouring under the grief of her husband's suicide, the effects of which have left such a severe impact that she is often timid and passive throughout. She refuses to join Cowley on the hillside, in his attempt to recreate his vision, for fear both that it might repeat itself and that it might not. * Richard Lundrigan: Cynical, combative, and often sardonic, Lundrigan provides the foil for Cowley, persistently and loudly making his doubts regarding the tutor's vision known. Brown calls him a ‚Äòrepresentative of realism‚Äô, who ‚Äòlives on within the walls of his own limitations, acting only upon what he can see and touch‚Äô. * Thomas Lavender: An ageing, ‚ÄòGod-haunted lunatic of a minister‚Äô,Brown, W. Dale. (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. London: Westminster John Knox Press. p. 43. Lavender is the antithesis of Lundrigan. Spiritual adviser to Cowley, Lavender is convinced of the truth of his ward's vision, and of what it demands: a recapturing of the innocence and moral purity of the children. * Rufus Este: red-haired, bespectacled, ‚Äòshort and a little fat‚Äô,Buechner, Frederick (1952). The Seasons' Difference. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. p. 18. Rufus is a clever fourteen-year-old boy. Both he and Harry like to compose poetry, and their friendship leads them to form an inclusive group, ‚Äòthe Uglies‚Äô, through which the two boys can express their adolescent sense of loneliness. Brown suggests that they are ‚Äòcharacters in transition‚Äô, who ‚Äòillustrate the gradual loss of spontaneous joyfulness and wondrous expectation.‚ÄôBuechner, Frederick (1952). The Seasons' Difference. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. p. 59. * Harry Fogg: a tall boy with ‚Äòdark hair and some pimples‚Äô,Buechner, Frederick (1952). The Seasons' Difference. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. p. 18. is similarly intelligent, and, like Rufus Este, struggling to come to terms with his growing sense of estrangement in the world. Upon seeing Mollie Purdue posing nude for Sara Dunn, Rufus experiences his first ever infatuation, falling painfully and awkwardly in love with her. * The other children: Timmy and Daisy McMoon are the young children of the bereaved Julie McMoon, and they are joined at the summer school by Ellie Sonntag, a conscientious and calm member of the group, often seen with her thick spectacles in hand. George Bundle is the first child we meet in the novel. Often preferring his own company to that of the other children, George listens intently to a conversation between Sara and Samuel Dunn regarding Cowley's vision while fishing in the pond. The only child of Samuel and Sara Dunn, Fendall Dunn is ‚Äòplump‚Äô, ‚Äòdark‚Äô in complexion,Buechner, Frederick (1952). The Seasons' Difference. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. p. 21. and twelve years old. * Mollie Purdue: a beautiful model for Sara's sculpting projects, Mollie journeys to the house from her home in ‚Äòthe city‚Äô. In her early twenties, she is endowed with the ‚Äòcertain power of being observed‚Äô, and, indeed, it is by observing her that Harry falls helplessly in love with her. == Composition == Following the publication of The Season‚Äôs Difference Buechner moved to New York City, there to pursue a career as a full-time writer. The young author began the composition of his second novel, however, while residing in New Jersey, where he had returned to teach English at his alma mater, Lawrenceville School. The majority of the manuscript, however, was composed while Buechner was on leave from Lawrenceville in Europe, ‚Äòmostly in England‚Äô. == Themes == Like Buechner's first novel, A Long Day‚Äôs Dying, his second is commonly considered to be broadly modernist in its style. The theme of suicide, present in A Long Day‚Äôs Dying, is also in view here through the grief of Julie McMoon. Similar also is the focus of The Seasons‚Äô Difference around the wearied sophistication of the leisure classes ‚Äì a common modernist trope. Into this modernism, however, Buechner weaves pastoral themes, included in which is the depiction of nature as a mysterious, liminal space. Death, innocence, and the attempt to recapture youth are also central to the novel, as are the theological questions that would become so vital to Buechner's later work. Indeed, critic Dale Brown writes that the novel posits the question, ‚Äòwhat are sophisticated folk to do with this claim of miracle?‚ÄôBrown, W. Dale. (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. London: Westminster John Knox Press. p. 47. Brown adds, however, that ‚Äòthe action of this novel as, as it was in A Long Day‚Äôs Dying, interior ‚Äì inside the minds of the various characters, even the cloudy and tentative minds of the children.‚ÄôBrown, W. Dale. (2006). The Book of Buechner: a journey through his writings. London: Westminster John Knox Press. p. 44. == Critical reception == Though often cited as Buechner's least-fated novel, The Seasons' Difference received a significant amount of praise from a variety of literary critics. Following its publication, the novel drew the following comment from Caspar Weinberger (later, in an article written for the San Francisco Chronicle: ‚ÄòIt is not too much to say that among America‚Äôs current novelists his abilities are the most obvious and his ultimate place is with the best we have produced‚Äô.Caspar W. Weinberger, ‚ÄòReviews of Six Recent Novels‚Äô, San Francisco Chronicle, January 13, 1952, 17. quoted in Brown, p.42 A review in Punch, written by Francis Bickley, labelled the work ‚Äòa brilliant book‚Äô,Francis Bickley, ‚ÄòA Second and Two Firsts‚Äô, Punch, August 13, 1952, p.241, quoted in Brown p.41. while Tangye Lean wrote in The Spectator that it was ‚Äòone of the most distinguished novels that has recently come out of America‚Äô.Tangye Lean, ‚ÄòFiction‚Äô, Spectator, July 25, 1952, p.142, quoted in Brown p.41 In his review written for the New Statesman, J.D.

He was part of the group that first isolated the influenza virus and developed one of the first vaccines against influenza. When Wilson Smith was ten years old, his father died and his mother took care of the four children alone. During his last year of secondary school at the Accrington Grammar School, he also taught at Great Harwood Elementary School. From 1915 to 1919 he served in France and Belgium as a private in the R.A.M.C.'s 107th Field Ambulance. From 1919 he studied medicine at the University of Manchester with degree qualification as both physician and surgeon (M.B., Ch.B.) in 1923. He was for two years a physician practising clinical medicine in Manchester and worked for one year as a ship's doctor aboard a Blue Funnel Line cargo ship. He then studied bacteriology, graduating with a higher medical degree (M.D.) in 1927. He went into research and led a virus research group at the Medical Research Council in Hampstead in north London. There in 1933 he, in collaboration with Christopher Andrewes and Patrick Laidlaw, succeeded in isolating human influenza A virus and transferring it to ferrets. In 1936 Frank Horsfall, Alice Chenoweth, and colleagues developed, in mouse lung tissue, a live influenza virus vaccine. In 1939 Smith became a professor of bacteriology at the University of Sheffield and in 1946 a professor at the University College Hospital Medical School at the University of London. He retired from the U.C.H. Medical School in 1960 but continued to do research at the Microbiological Research Establishment in Porton Down. Smith was also instrumental in the introduction of polio vaccination in the UK and headed the Medical Research Council's Biological Research Board. Smith was elected in 1949 a fellow of the Royal Society in and in 1959 a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, whose Bose Prize he received in 1959. He was in 1957 the Leeuwenhoek Lecturer of the Royal Society (Virus-Host Cell Relationships) and in 1960 the Royal Society's vice- president. In 1960 he received the Graham Gold Medal from the University of London. As a hobby, he played his violin in string quartets with friends. He married the bacteriologist Muriel Mary Nutt in 1927. Upon his death he was survived by his widow and their two married daughters. His brother George was Lecturer in mycology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and his brother Howard was lecturer in theology at the University of Manchester. ==References== Category:1897 births Category:1965 deaths Category:British virologists Category:Influenza researchers Category:Royal Army Medical Corps soldiers Category:People educated at Accrington Grammar School Category:Alumni of the University of Manchester Category:Academics of the University of Sheffield Category:Academics of University College London Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians ","title":"Wilson Smith"},{"id":"63909438","text":"Zin's Senate portrait picture Claudio Zin (born 11 November 1945) is an Italian-Argentinian physician and politician.

The Inn was built in 1855 in the vernacular Queen Anne Revival style and is the oldest commercial building in its area. The former Inn and its stables are part of the East Rockingham Heritage Precinct, which also includes other State Register of Heritage Places, such as Bell Cottage ruin, Hymus House and Day Cottage. ==Overview== Plaque about John Chester on the Rockingham Waterfront Pioneer Rotary Walk The Chesterfield Inn lies on what was one of the earliest land grants, and is one of the earliest buildings in the Rockingham region. It functioned as a stopping points for travellers on the Fremantle to Mandurah road and also briefly functioned as a post office from 1915 to 1918, the first in the region. The former stables of the Inn, located approximately 300 metres north, are also State Heritage listed. The Inn was a popular spot for couples on honeymoon because of its distance from both Fremantle and Perth. ==History== Ruins of the Chesterfield Inn Stables James Herbert, a local publican who had previously operated the Bush Inn in the district, purchased the land on which the Chesterfield Inn stands and obtained a liquor licence in January 1857 for the Rockingham Arms, the future Chesterfield Inn. In 1867, Herbert sold the Inn to William Rewell, with ownership subsequently transferred to Andrew Seubert in 1870 and William Summers in 1874. The Rockingham Arms became the Chesterfield Inn in the 1890s, having been purchased by John Chester in 1876. Chester eventually transferred ownership to his daughters Caroline and Eliza in 1890. The Inn was originally constructed as a two storey building but almost destroyed by a fire around 1910 or 1911, after which it was rebuilt as a single storey dwelling, now owned by Ernest and Selina Huxtable. After the death of the last licensee, a Mr. Huxtable, a change in the state's licensing laws, and the relocation of the main road, the Chesterfield Inn stopped functioning as such but retained its name, and featured in a series of articles on historic Western Australian homesteads in the Western Mail in late 1939. The former Inn also served as an encampment for the 10th Light Horse Regiment, from 1912, as a private dwelling and a dairy farm before becoming a youth hostel in 1979. A fire damaged the building in 1992 and it remained unoccupied from then on, its condition deteriorating until renovations by LandCorp took place in 2017. A security fence was installed, later non-heritage listed additions to the building removed, the front wall repaired and the roof restored in view of future occupancy. ==Heritage listing== The Chesterfield Inn is part of the East Rockingham Heritage Precinct, which also includes other State Register of Heritage Places, such as the Bell Cottage ruin, Hymus House, Day Cottage and the Mead Homestead, as well as heritage listed places on the municipal inventory like the East Rockingham Cemetery. The former Inn was added to the State Register of Heritage Places on 27 June 2003, and is the oldest commercial building in its area. ==References== ==External links== * Chesterfield Inn conservation plan (1999) Category:State Register of Heritage Places in the City of Rockingham Category:East Rockingham, Western Australia Category:Homesteads in Western Australia Category:1855 establishments in Australia Category:Historic hotels in Perth, Western Australia ","title":"Chesterfield Inn (Western Australia)"},{"id":"63909558","text":"Michael Anthony Vasco is a Filipino professor and educational administrator. == Education and career == Vasco is an alumnus of the University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Arts and Letters where he finished his bachelor in philosophy and where he served as dean in 2009.

Some Church Father report on the other hand, that Gnostics identified Sabaoth with Ialdaboath himself. == Name == The name Sabaoth appears in the Old Testament in reference to an army. In the First Book of Samuel, the name is used as a name of God. In Gnostic texts, the name should evidently rendered as \\"over all the forces (of chaos)\\". == In Gnostic sources == Sabaoth and his beneficial functions are associated with Jupiter, while Ialdabaoth with Saturn and the forces of evil.

They represent the choice psychics have between both; Ialdabaoth representing evil and Sabbaoth representing good. Thrown into Tartarus, Ialdabaoth envies his son, whereupon his envy takes on shape and becomes death. From death, envy, wrath, weeping, roar, loud shouting, sobber and grief emerge. Many of these emotions seem to be related to lament during funerals. As mourning was controversial among early Christians, associated with Satan, they might intentionally display disapproval about lamenting the dead and advocates control of emotions. However, this is not explicitdly spelled out and some emotions, such as anger for the rulers of darkness, are approved, thus differing from the Stoicism. After Ialdabaoth brought death into the world, Sabaoth creates a host of cherubim, a notion also appearing in Jewish Merkabah mysticism. == Non-Gnostic sources == Epiphanius of Salamis, the bishop of Salamis, Cyprus at the end of the 4th century, reports that Severian Encratites (also associated with Sethians) believed Sabaoth and Ialdabaoth to be one and the same, the God of law, and therefore evil. Celsus, a 2nd-century Greek philosopher, identified Ialdabaoth with Cronus and Sabaoth and Adonai with Zeus. Origen (c. 184 ‚Äì c. 253) denies the equation. That such identifications appears within Gnostic documents themselves, has not been proven. == See also == * Aeon (Gnosticism) * Docetism * Monad (Gnosticism) * Tetragrammaton == Sources == * Roger A.

He started on the varsity team his last two years, helping the Lancers reach a combined 17‚Äì1 record. He also helped Lawrence complete its first undefeated season. Pena received nearly 60 college recruitment letters during his junior season alone, but he ultimately chose to stay close to home to attend Dean College (then Dean Junior College). Pena was inducted into the Lawrence/Falmouth High School Athletic Hall of Fame as part of the 1998 class. == College career == Pena played two seasons for the Dean Bulldogs in 1967 and 1968 and was chosen as team captain in both years. The team went 3-4 and 2‚Äì6 in his two seasons. Despite Dean's records, Pena earned All-New England selections in both years. After the 1968 season, Pena decided to play football with the University of Massachusetts Amherst Redmen (now called Minutemen) for his remaining two years of collegiate eligibility. Pena was inducted into the Dean College Hall of Fame as part of the 1991 class. In the 1969 season, Pena helped the Redmen win the Yankee Conference with a 5-0 conference record and a 6-3 overall record. He earned All-Yankee Conference honors for his efforts. The Redmen declined in the 1970 season, amassing a 3-1-1 conference record and a 4-5-1 overall record, but Pena's skill did not fall with them. He earned All-Yankee Conference honors for the second straight season and was awarded the 1970 UMass MVP, marking the first time an offensive lineman has won the award. As his collegiate eligibility expired after the 1970 season, Pena entered the 1971 NFL Draft. He was later inducted into the UMass Amherst Hall of Fame as part of the 2015 class. == Professional career == Pena was selected in the fourth round of the 1971 NFL Draft (92nd overall) by the Cleveland Browns. He is the fourth-highest draft pick in UMass history. Through training camp in his rookie year, Pena earned a starting spot on the offensive line. However, there was a contract dispute between Browns owner Art Modell and Pena, hindering his ability to start for the team. After finishing contract negotiations, Pena suffered a knee injury that forced him to sit out most of his first year. Pena contemplated quitting football altogether after the injury, but Modell convinced him to stay and promised him a starting spot the following year. In the 1972 season, Pena saw considerable time on the field, starting 4 games and playing in 7 for the Browns. The Browns made the playoffs that year with a 10‚Äì4 record. Pena was named to the 1972 All-Rookie team, as he was eligible because of the amount of time he missed in the prior season. In the following seasons, Pena was unable to stay on the field due to continuous knee injuries. Repeated surgeries and cortisone shots forced him to retire before the 1975 season. == Personal life == After retirement, Pena went on to create and manage Mortage Security, Inc. In 2017, he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and six counts of wire fraud for creating a scheme to defraud Ginnie Mae. He was sentenced to 32 months in prison and ordered to pay Ginnie Mae $2.5 million in restitution in April 2019. In April 2020, Pena requested his release from a Massachusetts prison in light of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. This situation in the prison made it impossible to follow social distancing guidelines, which prompted Pena, who was in a highly susceptible demographic, to file the motion. == References == Category:American football guards Category:People from Wareham, Massachusetts Category:Living people Category:Players of American football from Massachusetts Category:1949 births Category:Cleveland Browns players Category:UMass Minutemen football players ","title":"Bubba Pena"},{"id":"63909673","text":"Mohammad Khalequzzaman Bangladesh Nationalist Party politician.

Under the Roman Empire, they are the only known source of the purple \\"imperial\\" variety of porphyry. They were exploited between the 1st and 5th centuries AD. The other imperial quarries in the Eastern Desert were Mons Claudianus, Mons Ophiates and Tiberiane. These four quarries were probably under a unified administration, since the same procurator metallorum is found in more than one. The quarries were discovered by Caius Cominus Leugas in AD 18. Their exploitation can be traced by hundreds of ostraca from not long after until the 430s. They were accessible only by means of a circuitous branch of the road between Caene on the Nile and the Roman fort on the Red Sea coast (today Abu Sha'ar). The actual quarries were spread out over . There were five dispersed villages for workers and a central complex at Wadi Abu Ma'amel above sea level. The highest quarries were at Rammius at . Quarried stone had to be dropped down slipways to the wadi below. The central complex had a workers' settlement, a fort, temples to Sarapis and Isis Megiste, a bath with a hypocaust and a cemetery. The temple of Isis can be dated to 113 and that of Sarapis to 117‚Äì119. There is evidence for blacksmithing in the workers' area. A second temple to Isis Myrionyma, dating to 137‚Äì138, lay on the other side of the wadi. The central complex had two wells and large cistern for water storage in the fort. The earliest settlement, where an inscription of Cominus Leugas is found, contains a temple to Pan. Several of the villages were only occupied into the 2nd century, but there are later tombstones, pottery and coins from the higher quarries. A tower at the central complex allowed for visual communication with even the most distant posts. Besides the main fort, there were also fortlets at Badia, Umm Sidri and Belia. Mons Porphyrites produced black porphyry as well as the imperial porphyry for which it is most famous. The latter was used in Rome and Constantinople for decorative purposes, especially in imperial sarcophagi. ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * * Category:Roman sites in Egypt Category:Quarries Category:Mines in Egypt Category:Red Sea Governorate Category:1st century in Roman Egypt Category:2nd century in Roman Egypt Category:3rd century in Roman Egypt Category:4th century in Roman Egypt Category:5th century in Byzantine Egypt ","title":"Mons Porphyrites"},{"id":"63909752","text":"Appapuram is a village in Guntur district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

The historical name of the castle is Neu-Felsberg. == Location == The Teufelsburg castle ruin lies to the west of Saarlouis on the edge of the middle Saartal at a height of 320 m above Sea level. The castle is north of Felsberg and is easily reached from Upper Felsberg as well as via the Vauban-Steig, a designated premium hiking path.Vauban-Steig on the Webseite Deutsches Wanderinstitut e.V. The castle offers its visitors a sweeping overview of the Saartal and the Hunsr√ºck. == History of the castle == === Construction and destruction === Following the destruction of the Altenfelsberg Castle in 1341 by the electoral prince and archbishop Baldwin of Luxembourg, Duke Johann I of Lorraine built this spur castle from 1354 to 1360. The first documented reference to the castle as \\"Neufilsberg\\" (= Neu- Felsberg) dates to 1370, and the first knight of Neufelsberg Castle was Arnold von Filsberg - a grandson of Arnold von der Br√ºcke, Lord of Siersburg and Felsberg. The final historical reference to the castle occurs in 1699 when it was already in ruins and no longer inhabited. The stones from the castle were used in 1680 by the French for the building of the fortified city of Saarlouis. === Excavation and partial reconstruction === The ruins are made up of the remnants of two castles ‚Äì an upper, older castle and a lower castle. Following a complete measurement of the castle grounds by Bernd Richter, a model of the lower castle was created that ultimately led to the site's excavation and the lower castle's rebuilding in 1968 according to the existing foundations with a restoration that lasted from 2009‚Äì2010. By contrast, after being plundered for stones in 1680, the upper castle was never restored. === Legend === The popular name Teufelsburg or \\"Devil's Castle\\" can be traced back to a local legend in which a knight of the castle made a pact with the devil to whom the knight sold his soul before engaging in a duel. The sound of his screams as he entered Hell are still said to be heard today. Visitors to the castle can arrange for a tour of the small museum inside the castle which contains finds from the excavations. Since April 2007, the museum displays tools and utensils from the castle mountain's sandstone quarry as well as fossils and minerals from the Felsberg.
